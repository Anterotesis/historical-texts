I first made my entrance into this busy world The principal house in this township  Downing  was built in the year  DOWNING  It certainly had no pretensions to the  English  name of  Downing  which doubtlessly was a corruption from  Eden Owain  the  Tre  or township in which it stands The founder was  John Pennant  son of  Nicholas Pennant  a younger son of  Hugh Pennant  of  Bychton  He married the heiress of the place and built a house which was much too large for the estate The stones were brought from  Nantybi  a dingle opposite to the house There is a tradition that the stones were rolled along a platform from the top of the quarry raised on an  inclined plane till they reached the building and there were elevated as the work increased in height till the whole was finished The house is in form of a  Roman  H a mode of architecture very common in  Wales  at that period On the front is the pious motto frequent on the  Welsh  houses  Heb Dduw heb ddim a duw a dig  n  which signifies  Without God there is nothing with God enough  There were only four generations of this branch  Thomas  the last died in and was buried in  Whiteford  church on  June  th of the same year He bequeathed his estate to my father who made the house his residence his own father being living and the house much better than our paternal  M EARTH P    TO pre  all disputes about the place and time of  th be it known that I was born on  June  th old style in the room now called the  Yellow Room  that the celebrated Mrs  C  ay  n  of  S  rowsbury  ushered me into the world and delivered me to Miss  J  y Perry  of  Merton  in this parish who to her dying day never failed telling me  Ah you rogue I remember you when you had not a shirt to your back  ANTIENT MODE OF NURSING  I WAS according to antient custom put out to nurse at a neighboring farmhouse called  Pentre  covered with thatch and which at present would be deemed a cottage My nurse's maiden name was  Pennant  and from the time of this great event she resumed it notwithstanding she had long used that of her husband  John Pierce  a freeholder of above a hundred a year He and she were fond of this charge which was ever esteemed a peculiar favor and honor The affection and connection is still retained in many parts of  Ireland  but what is unfortunate in more civilized  Wales  both seem at present almost extinguished  OF the affection between the fosterfather fostermother  AFFECTION OF  OSTER FATHERS c  and fosterbrother the instances were frequent The fidelity of  Robin ap Inko  fosterbrother to  Jevan ap Vychan  of the house of  Gwedir  in the reign of  Edward  IV was a most noted one In a fatal feud between  Jevan  and his brotherinlaw  Rys ap Howel  the latter expecting a fray provided a butcher to murder  Jevan  in the confusion of the battle and to him he gave orders in these terms The butcher not being acquainted with  Jevan Ap Rys  said  Thou shalt soone discerne him from the rest by his stature and he will make way before him There is a fosterbrother of his one  Robin ap Inko  a little fellow that useth to match him behind take heed of him for be the encountre never soe hot his eye is ever on his fosterbrother  and so it happened  Robin  suspected the treachery and seeing the butcher watching his opportunity came behind him and knocked him on the head in the moment in which he had come behind  Jevan  and had aimed one at that of his beloved fosterbrother The patrimony of his faithful follower was in the parish of  Llanderfel  and to this day retains the name of  Tyddin Inko  IN those days there was great competition for the honor of fostering the children of great men  HORRID MURDEN  The parson of  Llanvrothen  near  Traethmawr  had taken a child of  Jevan ap Robert  to nurse This so grieved the wife of  Rys  her husband having more land in the parish than  Jevan  had that she determined to have the poor parson put to death A woman was sent to his house who was kindly taken in At midnight she set up hideous cries pretending that the parson had attempted to ravish her This only was a pretence for revenge the woman had as the historian says  to her brethren three notable rogues  of the damned crew fit for any mischief being followers of  Howel ap Rys  These watched the parson and as he went one morning to look to his cattle cruelly murdered him the sequel is told in the  Welsh Tour  vol i p and the proper end of the villainsThese extracts are taken from the history of the  Gwedir  family a curious publication for which we are indebted to my true friend the Honorable  Daines Barrington  WHEN I came into possession of  Downing  by the death of my excellent father  David Pennant  the house had partly transome partly sashed windows By consulting a drawing of it in that state may be known the changes made by myself With the estate I luckily found a rich mine of lead ore which enabled me to make the great improvements I did The grounds were much hurt by a vile road running in front and on one side of the house and through the middle of the demesne to the hamlet called  Gwibnant  GWIBNANT  or  the meandring glen  The house was planted up almost to the door which gave it a very melancholy gloom But I soon laid open the natural beauties of the place and by the friendly exchange Sir  Roger Mostyn  made with me enlarged the fine scenery of the broken grounds the woods and the command of water The walks in the near grounds the fields and the deep and darksome dingles are at left three miles in extent and the dingle not ill united with the open grounds by a subterraneous passage under the turnpike road I am not a little flattered by the admiration of those who visit the place Mr  Boydel  has published a fine engraving of the house among his  Welsh  feats I have as a headpiece to p of this Work given it in the prettiest representation  GROUNDS  DOWNING  MY grounds consist of very extensive walks along the fine swelling lands beneath the shady depth of the glens  GROUNDS  or through the contracted meads which meander quite to the shore  VIEWS  The views are various towards the hills and the antient  Pharos  on  Garreg  Over the channel of the  Dee  the  Hilbree  isles on one of which had been a cell of  Benedictines  dedicated to our Lady and dependent on  Chester  and possibly the hermitage called  Hilburghey  which in the second of  Edward  III received ten shillings a year from a charity belonging to the castle at  Chester  The dreary woodless tract of  Wiral  a hundred of  Cheshire  stretches eastward as far as its capital chequered with black heaths and with corn a bad return to the prospect of our wooded slope yet formerly was so well cloathed as to give occasion to this distich  From  Blacon  point to  Hilbree  A squirrel might leap from tree to tree  But our sea view is animated with the sight of the numerous fleets entering and sailing out of the port of  Liverpool  now swelled into a vast emporium from a century and a half ago a most insignificant fishing town  IN the near view below the house are the ruins of the abbey of  Molandina  notwithstanding they are not very considerable they do not want their beauties Let me confess that this is a trap for antiquaries the name derived from  Mola  being a deserted mill antiquated by myself as an  imposture innocente  FAIRY OAK  Above this is a spreading oak of great antiquity size and extent of branches it has got the name of the  Fairy Oak  In this very  century a poor cottager who lived near the spot had a child who grew uncommonly peevish the parents attributed this to the  fair    and imagined that it was a changeling They took the child put it in a cradle and left it all night beneath the tree in hopes that the  tylwydd têg  or  fairy family  or the  fairy folk  would restore their own before morning When morning came they found the child perfectly quiet so went away with it quite confirmed in their belief  Shakspeare  and  Spenser  allude to this popular fiction  Spenser  is particularly allusive to the above  And her base elrin breed there for thee left  Such man do changelings call so chang'd by fairies theft  Besides this oak is another on a spot within the pleasuregrounds called  Mount Airy  It probably is of superior age to that I have just mentioned it is truly picturesque and has in it furrows so deep and of aspect so uncommonly venerable as to render its shade as worthy of the solemn rites of the  Druids  as those of  Mona  in its most prosperous days At a small distance below are three evergreen oaks of a considerable size I do not know how they came there for the wood in my father's time was in a state of nature Below those is a very antient towering oak of great size and in a dingle near the field called the  Coxet  is a tree of the same species of great size and beauty yet retaining the very habit of a vigorous sapling These and a fine  Spanish  chesnut are the boast of my  Sylvan  shades If I digrese beyond them let me mention a most antient peartree which gives name to a field  Coitia Pren Gellig  the stem has not a relique of sound timber it consists entirely of  rotten wood yet bears annually most plentiful crops of a choaky pear  THE house itself has little to boast of  HOUSE  I fortunately found it incapable of being improved into a magnitude exceeding the revenue of the family It has a hall which I prefer to the rural impropriety of a paltry vestibule a library thirty feet by eighteen a parlor capable of containing more guests than I ever wish to see at a time  Septem convivium novem convicium  and a smoakingroom most antiquely furnished with antient carvings and the horns of all the  European  beasts of chace This room is now quite out of use as to its original purpose Above stairs is a good drawingroom in times of old called the diningroom and a tearoom the sum of all that are really wantedI have  Cowley  's wish realized a small house and large garden  THE library is filled by a numerous collection of books  LIBRARY  principally of history natural history and classics My own labors might fill an ordinary bookroom many of them receive considerable value from the smaller drawings and prints with which they are illustrated on the margins as well as by the larger intermixed with the leaves among the latter are several drawings of uncommon beauty by that eminent hand Mr  Nicholas Pococke  These relate either to the  Ferroe  isles or to  Iceland  others to the distant  Tibet  or  Boutan  I was favored by  John Thomas Stanley  esq  with permission to have copies made of the first and by  Warren Hastings  esq  of the last Among my own labors  OUTLINES OF THE GLOBE  I value myself on my MS volumes of THE OUTLINES OF THE GLOBE in xxii volumes folio on which uncommon expence has been bestowed in ornament and illuminations  HALL  IN the hall are some very good pictures by  Peter Pa  ou  a fine painter of animals and birds four express the three climates two of them are of the  Torrid Zone  one the  Temperate  and another the  Frigid  all illustrated by suitable animals and scenery the two last have much merit Besides there is a romantic view in  Otabeite  and another of part of an isle of ice near the  Antartic Circle  with three different species of those strange birds the pinguins and two different species of the petrels this was taken from an original sketch made on the spot by Doctor  John Reinhold Forster  PORTRAITS  THE parlor is filled with numbers of portraits and other paintings The greater part of the first are reduced from the originals by  Moses Griffith  in a most masterly manner A few excepted they are family pictures A very large one covers the end of the room the figures are three quarters and dressed in the manner in which  Vandyk  did his the man has a remarkable good look long hair whiskers and small beard his wife is by him between them a boy with a basket of flowers and by him a grehound  DAVID PENNANT WIFE AND CHILD  These represent  David Pennant  sheriff of the county in his wife  Margaret Pennant  of  Merton  and their eldest son  Piers  This piece is done in a superior style a good imitation of  Vandyk  A grand column and a rich carpet is introduced a flattery of the artist for in those days we were far from being able to pay for even a performance of that value It probably was done in the troublesome times when some painter of merit might have wandered about the country and have been glad of working for his meat and his drink and some trifle for other necessaries  MY great great grandfather was an officer in the garrison of  Denbigh  when it was besieged and taken by my maternal great great grandfather general  Mytton  My loyal ancestor suffered there a long imprisonment  Bychton  was plundered and the distress of the family so great that he was kept from starving by force of conjugal affection for his wife often walked with a bag of oatmeal from the parish of  Whiteford  to  Denbigh  to relieve his wants  NOTWITHSTANDING the zeal of his house for the loyal cause it suffered very little in respect to the general composition of delinquents the  Bychton  estate only paid  l    s  whereas  Robert Pennant  of  Downing  paid not less than  l  for his estate which was very far inferior to the other The occasion was this  Robert Pennant  had the misfortune to have a hotheaded young fellow in his house when a small detachment of the adverse party with a cornet at the head approached the place He persuaded the family to resist the doors were barricadoed a musquet fired and the cornet wounded The house was soon forced and of course plundered but such was the moderation of the party no carnage ensued and the only revenge seems to have been the disproportionate fine afterwards levied  NOTWITHSTANDING his brother  Hugh  is not delivered down to us on canvas  MAIOR HUGH PENNANT  I cannot omit the mention of him as a brave and faithful officer in the royal army serving in  North Wales  He attained the rank of major and particularly distinguished himself in the isle of  Anglesey  In that island in imitation of several of the  English  counties rose in order to set the king at liberty and to restore monarchy to the oppressed kingdom Numbers of royalists resorted to this island from different parts  of  North Wales  and made a general muster in the middle of the island under the command of  Thomas  lord  Bulkeley  The parlement determined on their reduction and made  Conwy  the place of rendezvous General  Mytt  n  was the commanding officer he landed at  Cadnant  where  Hugh Pennant  was posted who after undergoing a severe fire from the rocks and hedges being left unsupported was obliged to retreat Two captains posted at  Porthaethwy  made so speedy a flight that it was said that one of them at lest had previously received the bribe of  l  for his treachery In the battle which soon after was fought near  Beaumaris Hugh Pennant  charged the enemy with great spirit and was very near taking that brave officer colonel  Lothian  prisoner Some others of the loyal officers conducted themselves with spirit but in general the islanders are allowed by their own historian a schoolmaster of  Beaumaris  to have behaved very ill An  Anglesey  captain was directed to keep the church he posted his men in it locked them safely up and then ran away with the key in his pocket The historian tells us that he was called Captain  Church  to his dying day They certainly had great valor at distant danger As soon as the enemy appeared marching over  Penmaenmawr  at lest four miles from  Beaumaris  the  Anglesey  people began to bustle drums beat trumpets sounded and great vollies of small shot and great were discharged at which the enemy says the sage pedagogue took little or no notice Major  Pennant  was probably taken in  Beaumaris  castle with the royal army to which place it had retired after the defeat As soon as he obtained his liberty he resided at  Brynshone  in the parish of  Yskivi  g  where he died on  March  th and was interred at  Whiteford  He was married to  Margaret Aungier  baroness of  Longford  one of the daughters of Sir  Thomas Cave  of  Slimford  in the county of  Northampton  knight This lady had four husbands she paid our country the compliment of beginning and ending with a  Welshman  her first was Sir  John Wynne  of  Gwedir  junior they lived unhappily together which sent him on his travels into  Italy  where he died at  Lucca  She then took one of the  Milesian  race for she married Sir  Francis Aungier  master of the rolls in  Ireland  afterwards created baron of  Longford  Thirdly she gave her hand to an  Englishman  Sir  Thomas Wenman  of  Oxfordshire  and finally she resigned her antiquated charms to our valiant major who in the year deposited her with his ancestors in the church at  Whiteford  THE next is a single figure a halflength of  Pyers  PYERS PENNANT  son of  David Pennant  with long hair a long laced cravat and in a singular gown His wife is in another frame a handsome woman with her neck naked and long tresses flowing on each side She was one of the celebrated seven sisters of the house of  Gwysanney  near to  Mold  who were all married about the same time and all became widows and of them only two of them renewed the nuptial vow These ladies being much talked of even to this day I add their names and those of their spouses Let me premise that they were daughters of  Robert Davies  by  Anne  eldest daughter of Sir  Peter Mutton  knight chief justice of  North Wales  and owner of  Llanerch  in the vale of  Clwyd  Anne  their first daughter married  John Thelwall  of  Plascoch  Katherine  Pyers Pe  ant  of  Bychton  Dorothy  married  George Hope  of  Doddleston  Elizabeth  Thomas Humphries  of  Boddlewiddan  Margaret  John Holland  of  Tyrddan  Ellen  George Wynne  of  Leeswood  Jane  Thomas Edwards  of  Rhual  Pyers Pennant  who occasioned this notice died in  I CANNOT well ascertain the next portrait which is of a handsome young man in long hair flowing and curling gracefully on his shoulders He is dressed in the military dress of the time a laced turnover and an elegant buff coat much ornamented and a musket with an aukward old lock in his hand and a sword by his side I suspect him to have been a son of  Pyers Pennant  who was slain the illconducted expedition to the isle  Rhi  under the duke of  Buckingham  in He probably was in the company of his neighbor captain  Richard Mostyn  a younger son of  Mostyn  who fell in the same spot  PETER PENNANT  THE portrait of my grandfather  Peter Pennant  represents what I well remember him to have been a fine person and of a jovial complexion He is dressed in a white tyewig and a red coat On the death of his first wife  Catherine  second daughter of the  Wynnes  of  Glynne  in  Merionethshire  he went into the army in the reign of Queen  Anne  and served at the siege of  Brussels  Disgusted with his colonel Sir  Thomas Prendergast  after demanding satisfaction which Sir  Thomas  declined he resigned and passed the remainder of his days at  Bychton  where he lived in great hospitality and died in  October  aged  HIS uncle  John Pennant  in a full brown wig  JOHN PENNANT OF CHELSEA  and brown g  wn By his jolly rubicund face he appears to have been a tho  ough  bonvivant  yet with much the air of the gentleman The original a well painted picture was given to us by  John Wynne  of  Coperleney  in this neighborhood who by the inscription on the back seems to have taken as much pride in being thought the friend of  John Pennant  as Sir  Fulke Grevil  did in being the friend of Sir  Philip Sydney  Many a bottle had they emptied during their thirty years friendship He resided at  Chelsea  where my father often visited him during the boyish holydays My father told me he was frequently taken by him to the coffeehouse where he used to see poor  Richard Cromwell  a little and very neat old man with a most placid countenance the effect of his innocent and unambitious life  I IMAGINE that the coffeehouse was Don  Saltero's  to which he was a benefactor and has the honor of having his name inserted in the catalogue I have when a boy seen his gift to the great  Saltero  which was a  lignified  hog I fear that this matchless curiosity is lost at left it is omitted in the last or th edition of the catalogueWhat author of us can flatter himself with delivering his works down to posterity in impressions so numerous as the labors of Don  Saltero  John Pennant  died in aged and was interred in the churchyard of  Chelsea  and had a small monument to his memory erected against the wall of the church by his wife daughter to Mr  Parry  of  Merton  a house and small estate which we now possess above a mile from  Downing  Her affection provided  the following epitaph which I give more on that account than for the excellency of the composition  EPITAPH  Near this place under a stone with his name on it lies the body of  John Pennant  gent second son of  David Pennant  of  Bichton  in the county of  F    esq  who departed this life the th of  June  aged In whose memory this monument was erected by his mournful widow who designs to be interred in the same grave  Had virtue in perfection power to save  The best of men from the devouring grave  Pennant  had liv'd but 'tis in vain to flie  The fatal stroke where all are doom'd to die  Farewel lov'd spouse since want of words appears  T' express my grief I'll moan thy loss with tears  Which like  N  le  's cataracts shall rumble down  And with their briny floods my passion drown  Here may thy ashes undisturb'd remain  Till thy wife's dust revisits thee again  Then sacred quiet till the day of doom  Seal the enclosure of our catacomb  His arms are those of the  Pennants  Her's those of  Edwyn  lord of  Tegengle  ROBERT PENNANT  ANOTHER of my kindred lies in  Pancras  churchyard I may be excused for mentioning him as his epitaph is far from inelegant This youth  Robert Pennant  was son to  Pierce Pennant  by  Katherine  one of the seven sisters of  Gwysanney  and was snatched away at the age of twentyfour in the year He was attended to his grave as was then the custom by a most numerous set of friends among whom were the two bishops and numbers of  the first gentry of  North Wales  who happened then to be in town Thus is delivered his amiable character  Gentilibus suis compositus  Robertus Pennant  Filius  dus  l'yercei Pennant  de  Bychton

translator of  Lucretius  after that his education was neglected but he was  abnormis sapiens  and of the best of hearts He passed a useful and worthy life to a good old age and departed with every expression of piety and resignation on  January  st aged  MY good and religious mother is painted in oil  MOTHER  over the chimneypiece she is dressed in blue her neck naked her tresses auburn long and flowing The painter was Mr  Fellowes  an artist of some merit who lived at  Wrexham  and  Chester  She was called a beauty 'in spite of her teeth' which were not good She was third daughter of  Richard Mytton  Esq  of  Halston  see  Tour in Wales  i p one of fifteen children by  Arabella  eldest daughter of Sir  John  Houblon  lord mayor of  London  in lord of the admiralty in the time of King  William  and the first governor of the bank of  England  See more of his history in my account of  London  p I have often been assured by some of my aunts that with their father and mother they had often danced to the number of eight couple My mother was born  September  th and married to my father  December  th The courtship was carried on at  Wynnstay  and the nuptials performed at the neighboring church of  Rhiwabon  That good man Sir  Watkin Williams Wynne  in a frolic jumped on the box and drove the bride and bridegroom to the churchdoor This excellent woman died in  London  of the smallpox in the year She near to her dying moment called me to the bedside and presented me with her silver etwee and looked as if she could have delivered her tender adieu in the  Augustan  style which I engraved on it VIVE MEMOR AMORIS NOSTRI ET VALE  ELIZABETH PENNANT  THE portrait of my venerable aunt  Elizabeth Pennant  was drawn in water colors in her old age by  Moses Griffith  and does him much credit It is a very strong likeness dressed in the old fashion with a long white handkerchief flung carelessly over her cap the countenance shews the goodness of her heart I speak gratefully of a friend who doated on me and mine I lost this valuable woman  October  d who with all the consciousness of a wellspent life quitted the earthly stage with the utmost tranquillity  JOHN MYTTON  MY respected uncle  John Mytton  of  Halston  born  September  th closes the list of relations His countenance indicates  the sweet disposition he possessed and  ll his features are amiable His dress a grey tyewig a blue coat with a scarlet mantle flung over one arm He was bred a merchant and spent much of his time in  Portugal  but succeeding his eldest brother  Richard  in his estate retired to  Halston  where he ended his benevolent life  I MUST not forget a shade of my affectionate uncle  James Mytton  fifth son of the same house and brother to the last  JAMES MYTTON  the kind friend of my youth with whom I lived long and strove to the best of my power to reap from him every advantage that his good sense good heart and polished manners wished to instil into my susceptible mind  I CONCLUDE the accounts of the portraits of our family with my own in a  Vandyk  dress by Mr  Willes  an ingenious artist who afterwards quitted the pencil and obtained holy orders to which he did no discredit  Moses Griffith  furnished this room with other reduced portraits That from the fine picture of Sir  Roger Mostyn  knight  SIR ROGER MOSTYN KNT  of whom more will be said when I arrive at the house is an admirable performance  SUPERIOR even to the portrait of Sir  Roger Mostyn  is that of  Humphrey Lloyd  taken from the original on board  HUMPHREY LLOYD  in possession of the Reverend  John Lloyd  of  Aston  in  Shropshire  This illustrious person was senator philosopher historian and physician He represented the town of  Denbigh  in He is celebrated also as an accomplished

Lucca  in It is taken from the original at  Wynnstay  He was buried there in the parish of St  John's  I have seen numbers of his letters which shew him to have been a most observant man He was eldest son of Sir  John Wynne  of  Gwedir  He is in black has a large ruff laced turnover and others at his wrists a white girdle stuck with points and a white belt passing over his shoulders and breast His countenance is good his hair short and dark his beard small and peaked  THE next is opposite to the other  SIR RICHARD WYNNE BART  a head of Sir  Richard Wynne  baronet grandson to old Sir  John  and last of the male line  ABOVE Sir  John Wynne  is a very fine head of  Charles  I by  Vandyk  He is elegantly dressed in a red jacket  CHARLES I  slashed and laced This was purchased at the sale of the late colonel  Norton  of  Southwick  in  Hampshire  by my worthy friend the late  Pusey Brooke  esq  and gratefully presented by him to the late Mr  Edwards  of  Brynford  to whom he lay under obligations It was on his death presented to my father and decreed to remain an heirlome in the family  OPPOSITE to  Charles  I is another  Charles  HIS GREAT GRANDSON  great grandson to the unfortunate monarch It is a head in oilcolors after the original by  Hussey  He was a man uncommonly handsome his fine brown hair is tied behind and curled on the sides his body and arms are clad in armor In the field he certainly took too great care of his person but I believe the armor to have been the painter's choice His highness had given himself the two orders for both the blue and the green ribbon grace his shoulders  THIS picture was originally the property of the late Sir  William Meredith  baronet He suddenly veered from the  Stuart  to the  Brunswick  line and thinking it unsafe to have a  Stuart  even in canvas presented it to my very worthy motherinlaw  Elizabeth Falconer  a true votary of exiled royalty On her death the choice of any of her personality having been in the most friendly manner offered by her son the Rev  James Falconer  D D I fixed on this The period of  Jacobitism  was over but I remember  the time in which I might have been struck out of the commission for having in my possession even the shadow of disaffection  ANSON  ANSON the persevering ANSON graces the lower end of the room a head painted when he was a captain before the year when he began his celebrated voyage This was the bequest of my uncle  James Mytton  who well knew the respect I had to the two illustrious brothers of  Shugborough  Lord ANSON was fortunate but his good fortune was the result of merit not of chance During his naval administration and during that more arduous one under  John  earl of SANDWICH the commerce of BRITAIN in every part was uninterrupted our colonies protected our acquisitions secured and in the latter war when we had all the world to combat our squadrons were every where The superior genius of the man disposed our fleets so as to gain all those advantages without neglecting without weakening the domestic safety of BRITAIN which must ever acknowlege his salutary strength of mind and bury his foibles in oblivion His blemishes were those of the private man his high qualities public benefits In his active days  No navies yawn'd for orders on the main  FROBENIUS  I HAVE very few other pictures I may boast of an admirable head of  Frobenius  the printer of the celebrated  Erasmus  by  Holbein  it is exactly the same with that of  Hatfield  See  Journey to London  p I will repeat what I said respecting that illustrious typographer He is dressed in a black gown lined with for  Frobenius  was a native of  Franconi    but settled at  Bazil  in  DOWNING  Published in the Act  by  Switzerland  of which city he became a citizen He was a man of considerable learning and the finest printer of his time  Erasmus  resided a long time with him attracted by his personal merit and his admirable skill in his profession for to him we are indebted for the most beautiful edition of the works of his illustrious friend  Frobenius  died in and was honored by the same hand with two epitaphs one in  Greek  the other in  Latin  THE next is a small halflength on copper of Saint  Charles Borromeo  praying before a crucifix  SAINT CHARLES BORROMEO  That illustrious prelate was an ornament to his church He is represented in his cardinal's dress with a wan and meagre countenance the effects of his sincere austerities Those alone ought not to have given him a place in the kalendar his genuine piety his benevolence his great deeds of charity furnished him with the fullest clame Add to this his courage in facing the pestilence which raged in  Milan  his native city in all its horrors He administered to the distressed every comfort spiritual and temporal Like  Marseilles  's good bishop  he escaped and received his heavenly reward  November  d  Or unknown portraits I have two One is of an officer  UNKNOWN PORTRAITS  I think by  de Gelder  a pupil of  Rembrandt  's It is much in the style of his master The figure is standing with a good military countenance In one hand is a long sword the point resting on the floor on his head is a hat and feathers his body is armed to the waist below are long skirts of buff his helmet is on a barrel the colorsfurled and rests against the wall his shield and warsaddle near them  De Gelder  was born in and died in  THE other is of a  Low Country  soldier a small full length a most graceful figure of a young man leaning on a chair with an emptied glass in one hand and on the floor a flagon and near is his white hat and feathers his hair long he is in a buff coat a broad leathern belt with a cloak flung carelessly over one arm he has vast boots and a long sword hanging down from his side  A SMALL but neat inside of a  Flemish  church and a fine painting of a white grous hung by one foot from a tree with some plants near the foot These are all the paintings I can boast of The last is by  Rysbrack  a painter born at  Antwerp  about the middle of the last century  I MAY conclude with a very neat drawing by  Moses Griffith  of the antient gardens of  Llanerch  in the  Italian  taste of the middle of the last century made by Mr  Mutton Davies  after his return from  Italy  they were fine in that style decorated with waterworks statues dials c c emitting water to the astonishment of the spectators The original of the drawing is from an old large picture in my possession  CABINET OF FOSSILS  Downing  may boast of a good and numerous collection of fossils and minerals partly collected by myself partly by my son in his extensive travels many of the specimens are elegant and most of them instructive  TYDDI  UCHA'  ABOVE a mile from  Downing  is  Tyddyn Ucha'  a farmhouse belonging to our family In the last century it was inhabited by my grandfather during the lifetime of his father My uncle  John Pennant  and two of my aunts were born there I have often heard it said with pride that once three baronets were  entertained there by the hospitable owner I vehemently suspect from the size of the house that at lest two of them must have slept together  MY father has often told me a ridiculous story of the effect of a jolly evening passed there by some of the convivial neighbors They had made very free with some ale which had been brewed with malt made of soul barley unfortunately mixed with the seeds of certain plant which brought on a temporary blindness The guests had not gone far before the symptoms seized them and they were led back to their host who was in the same condition They were suddenly alarmed with a violent scream in a female voice It seems that the  butleress  or female butler had in her repeated visits to the cellar sipped too plentifully of the  cwrw  and terrified with the effect betrayed herself by giving unguardedly full vent to her fears  IN those days the neighbors were much addicted to  terming  TERMING  i e  brewing a barrel of ale at some favorite alehouse and staying there till it was all drunk out They never went to bed even should the  term  last a week they either slept in their chairs or on the floor as it happened then awoke and resumed their jollity At length when the barrel was exhausted they reeled away and the hero of this  Bacchanalian  rout always carried the spiggot in triumph Coursing was very frequently the occasion of these  terms  each gentleman brought his grehound and often made matches more for the glory of producing the best dog than for the value of the bet  AT half a mile distance south of this house stands  Merton  MERTON ABBOT  in the township of  Merton Uwch Glan  I gave it the addition of  Abbot  to distinguish it from the many others of the same name It was built in the year and for the time was a tolerable house This and the  Holywell  estate was conveyed into our family by the marriage of  David Pennat  with  Katherine Pennant  daughter and sole heiress of  John Pennant  of  Holywell  and  Mary  daughter of  Thomas ap Thomas ap Edward  of  Merton John  was fourth in descent from  Nicholas Pennant  last abbot of  Basingwerk  and son of  Thomas ap David  c c his predecessor in the abbotship  David Pennant  who made this valuable acquisition died in  Katherine  survived him till the year This was the only marriage that added much to our estate since the time of  Madoc ap Thomas ap Meiiir  who sat down at  Bychton  with the heiress of  Philip O' Phicdan  hereafter to be mentioned  THE two  Mertons Uwch Glan  and  Is Glan  are adjacent townships They were at the time of compiling the  Doomsday Book  undivided and known by the  Saxon  name of  Meretone  or the township bordering over the  sea  COMPLAINTS OF TEGENGL  THE noblemen of  Tegengl  drew up a memorial which they presented to  John Peckham  archbishop of  Canterbury  containing among numbers of other grievances the wrong done to the men of  Merton  The archbishop whom in came down on the christian design of reconciling the differences between  Edward  I and  Llewelyn  seemed to pity their sufferings but it it not probable that the king paid any attention to their representations as he was then in full march against our gallant countrymen determined to make an effectual conquest of an enemy who gave him so much serious disturbance  ABOVE three hundred yards from my house  DOWNING UCHA'  on the opposite side of a dingle stands another  Downing  the seat of my worthy neighbor and friend  Thomas Thomas  esq  His good father came into possession of it about the year by marriage with Miss  Mary Lloyd  heiress of the place and descended from  Edwyn  prince or lord of  Tegengl  His  Llys  or palace was near  Northop  My muchlamented friend the Reverend  John Lloyd  of  Caerwys  was of opinion that the fat figure on one of the tombstones in  Northop  church represented this chieftain  MR  Thomas  was of  Llechweddgarth  in  Montgomeryshire  CRUEL FE  D    See  Tour in Wales  ii descended from  Brochwel Yscythrog  prince of  Powis  who bore sable three nags heads erased argent Before Mr  Thomas  's arrival a fierce feud raged between the two houses as usual in days of yore which on his appearance was changed into lasting peace I cannot but mention a cruel revenge which the  Montagues  used to take on their neighbor  Capulet  by the advantage of a stream which ran through their grounds in its way to our kitchen where it was applied to the purpose of a jack for the turning of a spit How often has that important engine been stopped before it had performed half its evolutions our poor  Capulet  swearing lady crying  Cogess  fuming and nurse screaming But  To hear the children mutter  When they lost their bread and butter  It would move a heart of stone  IN the footway to  Bychton  is the wood  WHITEFORD WOOD  the  Sylva  mentioned in the  Doomsday Book  At the time of that compilation it was  valued at  s  only Possibly the value did not increase greatly in the beginning of the sixteenth century when my ancestor  Hugh Pennant  of  Bychton  eighteenth in descent from their common stock married  Jonet  daughter of  Richard ap Howel  of  Mostyn  who led his troops to  Bosworth Field  Tradition says that money being wondrous scarce in those days he was offered this wood as a portion with the lady which our family rejected as of no value in a country of forests I cannot estimate the thousands it would have been worth at present or in course of time  A LLYS  IN this wood are the remains of some antient  Llys  or palace as my friend the late antiquary of  Cherwys  used to maintain I can only say that to judge of the foundations our palaces in those days were not very splendid  LINE OF TUDOR TREVOR  THE line of  Tudor Trevor  with all its branches is so frequently spoken of that I shall here continue his descent He was son of  Y  ger ap Cadvarch  earl of  Hereford  in right of his wife  Rhiengar  daughter and heir of  Llwdocea ap Karadoc Vreichvras  or the earl of  Hereford  grandson to the said  Karadoc  and greatgrandson to  Karadoc Vreichvras  earl of  Hereford  and  Marchiogen  in the time of prince  Arthur  and who had besides the honor of being one of the knights of the rou  ble  Tudor  married  Angbarad  daughter to  Howel Dda  prince of  Wales  renowned for his wise laws who quitted his government and retired to  Rome  and there died in whose death was sore bewailed of all men  for he was a prince that loved peace and good order and that feared God  I am sorry to deprive our ancestor of his title of earl the  Welsh  had none such among them Our great  men had that of  Arglwydd  or  Lord  and the chief or monarch that of  T'wisog  or  Prince Tudor  had in right of his mother immense possessions in  Herefordshire  and in all that country then called  Ferlys  which lies between the  Wye  and the  Severn  He was also lord of  Whittington  in  Shropshire  See  Tour in Wales  i p and made that castle his residence Let me observe that many of his estates being in the marches of  Wales  he was called of the  Tribe  of  March  to distinguish him from the other tribes  THE families descended from this chieftain were exceedingly numerous but those still existing in the male line are only the following  Thomas Trevor Hampden  viscount  Hampden Richard Pennant  Lord  Penrhyn  Sir  Roger Mostyn  and the  Mostyns  of  Bryngwyn  of  Segrwyd  branches of his family and Sir  Pyers Mostyn Eytons  of  Eyton Wynnes  of  Gwerninvawr Jones's  of  Llwynon  and  Jeffries's  of  Acton  existing in my friend the Rev Dr  Jeffries  residentiary of  St Paul's  and worthy Rector of  Whiteford  and the  Pennants  of  Bychton  ADJACENT to this wood is my paternal seat  BYCHTON  I may say the primaeval seat of our family The date on a piece of wood over an added window is This gives an idea of the house of a gentleman of middling estate in those days There was a much more antient date on a beam in the barn which was inadvertently destroyed when I new built it I lived at this seat in and at that time I recollect buying of the tenant who with great civility quitted it to me his stock of wheat at  s  the hobbet consisting of two measures of fortyone quarts each  LET me contrast this to a year of scarcity in our country that of when I find by a diary kept by a  Peter Roberts  of  St Asaph  that in the same year wheat was sold at  s  the hobbet rye at  s  and vetches at  s  Change this into the present value of silver the hobbet of wheat at this time would be equal to  s  of barley to  s  ½  d  and vetches to  s  ¼  d  a calculation for which I am indebted to the ingenuity of my good assistant the Rev Mr  Henry Parry  of  Holywell  SUMMERHOUSE  VERY near to the house stood a summerhouse a building very frequent near the seats of  Welsh  gentry with a cellar beneath These were used as retreats for the jovial owners and their friends to enjoy remote from the fair their toasts and noisy merriment Mine was so near to ruin that I was obliged to pull it down I remember oaks of a vast size growing near to the house This and I may say the other lower parts of the parish are finely wooded with that noble species of tree which grows spontaneously was this part deserted it would relapse into its original state and become an impenetrable forest  MADOC AP MEILER  NOW let the whole  Welshman  arise in me Let me relate how  Madoc ap Meiler  surnames were not as yet  ap Thomas ap Owen ap Blydden ap Tudor ap Rhys Sais ap Ednesyd ap Llowarch Ga  ap Llyddocca  fil

and heir of  Philip o Phicdan  by  Margaret  daughter and heir of  Dafydd ap Ririd  c c of  Penley  in  Maelwr  This  Philip o Phicdan  was son See  Harlcian  Library N  o  to  Philip ap Yswittan Wyddel  of the  house of  Dungannon  in  Ireland  one of the  Irish  cavaliers who followed  Gryffydd ap Conan  out of that island to assist him to regain the throne of his ancestors about the year usurped by  Trahaern ap Caradog  THE great and decisive victory on the mountains of  Carno  in the county of  Montgomery  in the same year was owing to the valor of  Philip  The usurper was defeated and slain after the bloodiest contest in our annals  Gryffydd  was reinstated in his lawful dominions and reigned with great dignity during fiftyseven years He was not ungrateful to his  Milesian  general he bestowed on him great possessions in his newrecovered dominions  Historia Gryffyd ap Conan  MS N  o    G  ddaeth  Library  of which one of his sons inherited  Bychton  It remained in the male line only one generation after  Yswittan  as we have above said If we reckon thirty years to a generation the match between  Madoc ap Meiler  and  Alice  must have taken place very early in the next century if not in the same This gives us a priority of landed possession in the parish of  Whiteford  to any other freeholder  Madoc  being only tenth in descent from  Tudor Trevor  THIS my ancestor  Madoc  probably lived also by the sword for I cannot with any certainty prove that before this time he had any landed property I presume he was content with his acquisition of the fair  Alice  and the  Bychton  estate not  Putecaine  as the barbarous  Normans  made it in the  Doomsday Book  at which period  Widfor i e Whiteford  was  terra unius carucae et ibi erat cum duobus villanis et  XII  inter servos et ancilla ibi piscaria  and  Sylva  or the wood above mentioned But I fear we had been long before robbed of the wood at lest and  possibly of our  piscaria  c either by our own countrymen or the tyrant  Saxons Madoc  sat down quietly on his lands his offspring seem to have been much respected for his son  Jerwerth  married the daughters of two princes his first wife was daughter of  Owen  lord of  Tegangl  and his second the daughter of the lord of  Allington  and  Ruthenland  We went on begetting sons and daughters for a long space My son may boast of being sixteenth in descent from the great  Madoc  or twentyfifth from  Tudor Trevor  where for brevity sake I take up the pedegree otherwise I might reach the renowned  K  rda Wlodig  after passing through five most celebrated descents  ARMS  Madoc  assumed the arms of  Yswi  tan Wyddel  his wife's grandfather viz  Fyelde silver three barres wavey azure on the mydle barr three shieldrakes of the fyrste  and for his next coat by the name  Philip Phichdan  'three boars in palle silver' these are so defined and placed quarterly by that able genealogist  John Charles Brooke  esq  Somerset  herald whose untimely end I find daily reason to deplore The three boars were the arms of  Yona  ap Gr  wy  of  Penley  in  Ma  wr  hundred in the county of  Flint  My father had some small possessions in that country which he sold to improve our estate nearer home Those probably were derived from  Philip Phicdan  and devolved to  Madoc  on his marriage with his daughter  Alice  I OBSERVE that the descendants of  Yswyct  n Wyddel  varied in their first coat  Margaret  one of the daughters and heiress of  David ap Kynric ap Philip Phycdan  bose in a white field two sesses azure and in each the three shieldrakes She married  William Salusbury  of  Llewenni  says the  Salusbury  Pedegree  p b who served in parlement for the borough of  Leominster  in the sixth of  Edward  III and several other parlements as late as that of the thirtyeighth of the same prince  THE family assumed afterwards their proper arms those of  Tudor Trevor  In the year a patent for a crest the antelope's head most strangely disfigured with heraldic liberty was granted to  Pyers Pennant  one of the four gentlemenushers to Queen  Elizabeth  and to the posterity of his father  Hugh Pennant  In this patent which I have in high preservation the first coat is that of the  Trevors  the fyelde party par bend sinister ermen and ermyne a lion rampant goulde langued and armed gules  The two next are as described above and the fourth by the name of  Gruffydd Lloyd  the fyelde azure three flowerdeluces of the fyelde  and such is the  dictum  of  Robert Cooke alias Clarentieux  ROV D'ARMES  THE  Mostyns  of  Mostyn  bear as their crest a lion rampant  THE  Trevors  who were the  Pencenedl  or head of the whole line had for their crest the wivern or dragon on a cap of dignity The present Lord  Hampden  is its true  Pencenedl  but by heraldic rules on the descent of the  Hampden  estate to his lordship from the alliance of his ancestor Sir  John Trevor  with the  Hampdens  the talbot the crest of that family supersedes the antient dragon  THE dragon was worn as a cogni  ance by all our princes particularly by  Cadwaledr  who died in It was adopted by  Henry  VII who clamed descent from him and wore it in he battle of  Bosworth  It took its origin from the legend of  Uther Pendragon  father of king  Arthur  who is said to have received  the addition of  Pendragon  from his wearing that imaginary animal on his helmet  OUR bards united with the poet the office of herald At first our pedegrees were preserved by oral communication afterwards committed to writing and preserved in the houses of our great men The heralds office is at present a great repository of these kinds of treasure  BY the first we are assured of many other illustrious descents from princes' ancestors to our  Tudor Trevor  from the princes of  Powis  from  Rywalbon Conwyn  who with his brother  Kynric  were joint princes of  North Wales  from even  Roderic  the Great and from  Cadwaladr  and finally from  Vortigern  the unfortunate king of the  Britons  who fled from the rage of his subjects for his invitation of the  Saxons  into  Britain  and died ingloriously about the year in the darksome  Nant y Gwrtheyrn  in the county of  Caernarvon  Tour in Wales  ii p    THE  English  heralds attempt to add fame to our race by telling us that the present Sir  Roger Mostyn  is nineteenth in descent from the Conqueror from  John of Gaunt  from  Richard Plantagenet  duke of  York  father to  Edward  IV I leave  Arthur Collins  vol iii p to adduce the proofs Why will my ingenious countrywoman after admitting these honors  British Synonymy  i p  deny to us BIRTH by distinction fine as ether and as imperceptible allowing us only the advantage of family And notwithstanding the lady's justlyfavored  Johnson  makes birth and lineage synonymous yet my cousin will allow us no more of the former than what that great writer defines the  act of coming  into the world  the act which graced our country with its fair synonymist  I HOPE the reader will not think me too warm for thus vindicating my clame to  birth  in common with my worthy brotherinlaw I am jealous that the honors which I possess by means of our marriage with his aunt  Shonet  ten ascents higher should receive any abatement and I trust that the lady concerned will as a  Welshwoman  even applaud my warmth on so very interesting an occasion  OUR house has always been the  Pencenedl  or chief of the name We had several branches all which excepting those I have enumerated are extinct in the male line unless it be in the gentleman who of late years spread our celebrity in the capital under the title of  Pennant's Parcel Post  THE first who branched from us was the hospitable the useful the valiant  Thomas Pennant  abbot of  Basingwerk  son of  David Pennant ap Tudor  before mentioned He flourished in the reign of  Edward  IV and is highly celebrated by  Guttun Owain  a bard of the year who records the hospitality of the abbot in a poem printed in the collection of Mr  Rhŷs Jones  The poet is so liberal of his praise as to say  That he gave twice the treasure of a king in wine  Er bwrw yno aur brenhin  Ef a roes deufwy ar wîn  And among his other luxuries I think he enumerates sugar which a rich abbot of the fifteenth century might easily indulge  himself in for it had been a great article of commerce in  Sicily  as early as the year  Guttun Owain  also adds  Tŷ da i'r ŷd o'r tu draw  Tŷ brâg sydd Tŷ  b  ics  iddaw  A good granary on the other side a malthouse and a house of bricks which last was probably a material in building of recent introduction in our country  Guttun Owain  and  Tudor Aled  another noted bard speak not only of his works of utility of the water and of the windmills he erected of his having enlarged and beautified the abbey but also compliment him on his prowess in battle Neither is  Guttun  silent on a subject pleasing to every  Welsh  ear the pedegree of his patron whom he derives from  Edwyn  and from  Rhŷs Sais  a direct descendant from  Tudor Trevor  IT is probable that our abbot discovered that celibacy did not suit his constitution He quitted his profession and became in the law term a monk  deraigne  and married into the great house of  Peurbyn  a lady of the name of  Angharad  He became the father of four children Of them  Edward  the eldest succeeded to the fortunes which he seems to have secured in the parish of  Holywell Thomas  the second son became vicar of  Holywell  And  Nicholas  the third in due time abbot of  Basingwerk  he was the last and became founder of a family as I shall have occasion to mention More also will be said of the line of  Edward  who may be considered as the first of the house of  Bagilt  WE did not assume the name of  Pennant  till the time of  David Pennant ap Tudor  fifteenth in descent from  Tudor Trevor  it is a  true  Welsh  name taken from  Pen  a head and  Nant  a dingle our house of  Bychton  being seated at the head of a very considerable one The name is very common in  North Wales  applied to places such as  Pennant St Melangl Pennant Mowddwy Pennant Lliw  c c I have found it in  Cornwal  and again in the great bay of  Douarnenez  in  Bretagne  where among numbers of other  Welsh  names is that of  Pointe Pennant  IT has been delivered down to us  GI  CS  that in some distant time a gang of gipsies used to haunt this dingle and that eighteen of them were executed after which the gipsey race never more frequented the neighborhood I cannot learn their crime possibly there was none for they might have been legally murdered by the cruel statute of the st and d of  Philip  and  Mary  which enacts  that if within forty days next after proclamation of this present act shall be made that then he or they which shall not depart and avoid within the said time of forty days according to the true meaning of this act shall be judged and deemed according to the laws of this realm of  England  a felon and felons and shall suffer therefore pains of death loss of lands and goods as in other cases of felony and shall be tried as is aforesaid and without having any benefit or privilege of sanctuary or clergy  Sir  Matthew Hale  tells us that in  Suffolk  a few years before the restauration were executed at a single assizes not less than thirteen but none on that barbarous law have suffered since that time In these humane days the gipsies may wander in peace provided they behave inoffensively wheresoever they chance to make their transient abode for the bloody act was repealed in the twentythird year of his present majesty  OUR FIRST M    GE WITH AN ENGLISHWOMAN  David Pennant  was the first of us who married into a  Saxon  family he took to wife  Anne  daughter of  John Done  of  Utkinton  in  Cheshire  by  Anne  daughter of  Richard Heaton  of  Heaton  in the county of  Lancaster  He begat many sons and daughters among them was the famous abbot  Thomas  and also Sir  Hugh Pennant Offeiriad  or priest whom the great  Lhuyd  in his  A  aelogic  p calls an able poet in the time of  Henry  VIII and I find also that in he was at an  Fisteddfod  at  Caerwis  secondary student in vocal song and he was the only musical man in all our line  OUR FIRST SHERIFF  TILL the advancement of  Richard Pennant  to the title of  Penrbyn  our house was never distinguished by any honors beyond the most useful one that of justice of the peace I should blush if a  Pennant  should be found who through lack of public spirit sloth or selfishnese could decline that great constitutional office The first sheriff of our house was  Pyers Pennant  who discharged that trust in He had the lot of marrying the daughter of a family not famed for placidity or the milder virtues  Valdè valde irritabile genus  'And from them  Tom  a most worthy aunt of mine used often to tell me we got our passion'and frequently added the wise  Welsh  caution  Beware of a Breed  THE fruits of this marriage appeared very soon  Thomas  the eldest son in a  furor brevis  killed his miller was indicted for the manslaughter tried and convicted but received his pardon dated in the first of  Charles  I or the year This grace preserved him from the ignominious part of the sentence and the more important advantage of preserving his personality which would otherwise have been forfeited to the crown  THIS is sufficient to shew that the offence did admit of every palliation but a stronger proof than that may be drawn from the following honor having been conferred on him when we find that in eight years afterwards in he was intrusted with the care of the county of  Flint  by having the office of high sheriff committed to his charge He died the next year  cujus animae propitietur  DEUS This unfortunate man married a granddaughter of that nuptialloving dame  Catherine y Berran  See  Tour in Wales  vol ii p  Mary  daughter of  Edward Wynn  of  Ystrad  son of  Morris Wynn  of  Gwydir  fourth and last husband of our famous  Catherine  There was no issue from this match so  Bychton  descended to  David  the next brother  IN those days and long preceding  PRESENTS TO SHERIFFS  it was customary for the friends and neighbors of the sheriff to make presents to him to assist in defraying the expences I have among my papers two long rolls of gifts To give the whole would be very tedious I extract only a few of the most remarkable among which are several in money which his friends were not ashamed to offer nor the sheriff to receive The

nurse in  Romeo and Juliet  calls for it amain under the name of  aqua vitae  Some  aqua vitae  ho my lord my lady  It appears to have been chiefly used in those days for medical purposes  IN captain  Wyndham  's voyage to  Guinea  there was brandy on board for the use of the sick sailors It was said to have been invented by  Raymundus Lullius  the famous alchemist who died in the year  Charles the Bad  king of  Navarre  came to a most horrible end says  Mezerey  i who to restore his strength weakened by debauchery was wrapped in sheets steeped  in  au d  e  His valet by accident set fire to them after the third day he died in the most dreadful tortures and it is to be hoped thus expiated the crimes of his most execrable life I am indebted for the origin of brandy to a most elaborate essay on it which I received from Mr  William Taylor  of  Norwich  by favor of my friend Dr  Atkin  WILLIAM PENNANT G      I NOW in gratitude take up the brief history of  William Pennant  second son to  Hugh Pennant  of  Bychton  by  Sionet  daughter of  Richard ap Howel ap Moston  His good deeds towards the poor of our parish and his good intention towards our family give him full clame to this token of respect  William  was a goldsmith and jewelier he lived at the  Queen's Head  in  Smithfield  and by the sign of his shop and by the several bequests he made to persons about the court he probably was goldsmith and jeweller to the royal family  HIS WEALTH  He made a considerable fortune and died possessed of the manor of  Moxhall  in the parish of  Andley  in the county of  Essex  the

the manor of  Thornes  to his brother  Pyers Pennant  of  Mailard Green  in the county of  Essex  the gentleman usher before mentioned  ALL these fruits of  William Pennant  's industry were dissipated by my unfortunate name sake mentioned in a preceding page  D  BY HIS NE    who luckily died before he had ruined our paternal estate  HIS bequest in money to the poor of  Whiteford  parish had a better fate  HIS CHA    It was laid out in the purchase of land in the parish of  St Asaph  the produce of which annually clothes completely eighteen poor men or poor women on the feast of  St Thomas  On the expiration of the lease of those lands I trust that double the number will experience the benefit of this charity  William Pennant  also remembered several of his friends by legacies at this time appearing to us very singular  BEQUEST TO HIS FRIENDS  Besides some small legacies in money he bequeathed the following articles  Item  I give and bequeath unto Sir  William Fortescue  K  •

James Howel  STRANGE STORY OF JOHN PENNANT  in the xliiid letter of his  Epistolae HoElianae  makes  John Pennant  third son of  Pyers  Pennant  of  By  h  n  and brother of the worthy  William  the instrument of presages to our kingdom of the evil days and evil times which were advancing with rapid pace The relation is very properly addressed to that mirror of credulity Sir  Kenelm Digby  knight  D A  EN  S HEART  'It was my fortune' says the solemn historian  to be in a late communication where a gentleman spoke of a hideous thing that happened in  High Holborn  how one  John Pennant  a young man of being dissected after his death there was a kind of serpent with divers tails found in the left ventricle of his heart which you know is the most defended part being thrice thicker than the right and is the cell which holds the purest and most illustrious liquor the arterial blood and the vital spirits The serpent was it seems three years ingendring for so long time he found himself indisposed in the breast and it was observed that his eye in the interim grew more sharp and fiery like the eye of a cock which is next the serpent's eye in redness so that the symptom of his inward disease might have been told by certain exterior rays and signatures  GOD preserve us from public calamities for serpentine monsters have been often ill favored presages I remember in the  Roman  story to have read how when snakes or serpents were found near the statues of their Gods at one time about  Jupiter  's neck another time about  Minerva  's thigh there followed bloody civil wars after it  THIS portentous story is given most scientifically by Dr  Edward May  in a thin quarto pamphlet of forty pages The  titlepage will inform the reader of his various other titles which savor most strongly of quackery  A MOST CERTAINE AND TRVE RELATION OF A STRANGE MONSTER OR SERPENT Found in the Left Ventricle of the Heart of  John Pennant  Gentleman of the Age of Years  By  Edward May  Doctor of Philosophy and Physick and Professor Elect of them in the Colledge of the Academy of  Noblemen called the Musaeum Minervae  Physitian also Extraordinary unto her Most Sacred Majesty  Queene  of GREAT BRITAIN c  LONDON Printed by George Miller MDCXXXIX  engraved title page  THE epistle dedicatory is  to the renowned peere of this kingdom  Edward  earle of  Dorset  the book itself to Sir  Theodore Maiherne  knight In that he lays before him the wonderful case He tells us that he was sent on  October  th by Lady  Herris  wife to Sir  Francis Herris  knight to dissect her nephew  John Pennant  who had deceased the night before to know the cause of his death The doctor brought with him Master  Jacob Heyden  surgeon to assist in the enquiry Mr  Heydon  made incision into the left ventricle of the heart which was full of blood On thorough examination the monster was discovered the head of which was so like to that of a serpent that Lady  Herris  shivered to see it To judge by the prints all the upper part of it was cylindrical towards the lower part bifurcated and each fork divided into five long and slender fibrillae I leave to the reader the perusal of the rest of Dr  May  's most curious disquisition  THIS is not the only instance of similar appearances in the heart but we hear no more of serpents the name was changed to  polypuses  to which for their numerous ramifications they might bear the resemblance In our Philosophical Transactions are more than one paper on the subject In Mr  Lowthorp  's Abridg iii p and tab p is an account and the figure of one found in the heart of a man at  Oxford  and in Mr  Martyn  's Abridg ix p is the account of several discovered in numbers of sailors who died immediately on their return from the  West Indies  This paper was written by the celebrated Dr  Huxbam  he quotes  Malpighius Bartholinus Tulpius  and  Pechlin  as giving incontestible instances of the existence of polypi in the heart in the strictest sense This opinion is now exploded The only uncommon circumstance my ingenious friend Dr  Haygarth  assures me is that the left ventricle of the heart and probably the  aorta  which after death are usually empty were  in these cases full of blood The  crassamentum  upon coagulation had taken the form of the arteries in which it was contained  I BREAK a little into chronology  BARBAROUS EVENTS  to conclude with an event relative to another of my house of little moment indeed but merely to give a picture of the barbarous days even of the beginning of the last century which I collected from the journal kept by  Peter Roberts  of  St Asaph  before mentioned He records that on  July  d  Hugh Pennant  brother to  Pyers Pennant  esq  of  Bychton  died of a broken head given him at  Denbigh  by  Pyers Hughes  That in the year  Rowland Evan  a vicar of  St Asaph  was killed at an alehouse in  Llandrillo Eiderneon  That on  October  d Mr  Richard Thelwal  was slain at his own house at  Ruthen  And that in one  Foulkes  of  Cilowen  killed his wife and cut his own throat  THE mention of ale house tempts me to speak of a house of mine by the seaside in the township of  Bychton  LLETTY GONEST  called  Lletty Gonest  or the  honest house  It had been formerly in the highest repute for its excellent ale brewed by a good alewife yclep'd  Jane  of  Lletty  whom I well remember She acquired both fame and wealth both of which I may say she bequeathed to her descendants who to this day by their own industry continue to flourish on the effect of her's  THE house was originally built by one  Smith  from  Worcester  partly for the purposes of distilling and partly for a warehouse I am told that it occasionally had served for the place of confinement for impressed men at the time in which the colliers  had such great trade with  Dublin  The strong bars in the lower windows favor that notion  SINGULAR HEAD  ABOVE the door is a very singular sculpture cut in basrelief in stone and let into the wall One part is a strange chimerical figure of a monster with four legs and the head of an owl fixing its claws in the side of a human head The face is averted and expressing much agony The eyelids are drawn up the eyes the same the mouth half opened and the teeth closely fixed together The face is young but has a pair of whiskers and is far from being ill cut It has the character of one of  Le Brun  's passions article  Pain  It evidently never was designed for this place but seems originally to have been one of those fanciful  gothic  sculptures belonging to some antient church  SMUGGLING  IN the reign of King  William  this house was remarkable for the violent hands laid on a vast seizure of  French  wines to the amount of sixty pipes which had been smuggled into the great barn at  Trelacre  in the parish of  Llanasa  destined for the use of the  Welsh  gentry in this and the neighboring counties It must be observed that in those days portwine was in very little use in our country The officers had conveyed this prize with safety as far as  Lletty Gonest  where they intended to sleep that night At midnight they were alarmed by the entry of multitudes of colliers who tied every body in the house neck and heels They removed the wine into other carriages and conveyed it into places so secure that it never more could be heard of Many of the colliers were observed to have rings on their fingers and fine linen In fact numbers of them were the gentlemen interested in the wine and concerned in the recapture who mixed with  the colliers to direct them in their operations A proclamation was issued out for the discovery of the offenders but such was the fidelity of our people that they were never detected The poor tapster in particular knew perfectly well who they were and large rewards were offered to him by the customhouse but nothing could shake his attachment to his friends He lived long after supported by the grateful contributions of the neighboring 'squires  HIGH above  Lletty Gonest  stands a summerhouse built by my grandfather to which he often adjourned with his guests to regale them with the delicious beer brewed by the famous  Jane  Many years after when I became master of the estate I also had my adjournment but it was either to eat shrimps or to drink tea An honest vicar of a distant parish who had been a most intimate friend of my convivial grandfather enquired whether I ever went to the summerhouse and was answered 'Now and then to drink tea' Struck with horror at the degeneracy of the grandson the good man with indignation exclamed  DRINK TEA his grandfather would have SCORNED IT  THE turnpike road designed for the enabling the smelters and others to convey our coal to the places of its destination from the  Mostyn  and  Bychton  pits passes by  Lletty Gonest  and goes along the shore towards  Holywell  In the space of a mile it passes by three smeltinghouses  Shopgoch  the property of Sir  Roger Mostyn  and  PenyRo  and  Llanerchymôr  belonging to me The last disputes antiquity with most in the county the late works at  Gadlis  excepted  ABOVE the last is the neat house of  Kinsale  inhabited by my good friend and tenant Mr  Ralph Richardson  who for several years had with great success and integrity carried on the smelting business with the advantage of shipping the produce from the very spot after a short carriage to the vessels  A SMALL marsh begins a little beyond  Lletty Gonest  and widens as it extends southward It borders on the manor of  Mostyn  but itself owns no lord but the king The same may be said of the valuable remainder as far as the manor of  Coleshill  in the parish of  Flint  The minor of  Greenfield  in the parish of  Holywell  was long supposed to have been the property of one or other of two clamants who fell into dispute about the right The matter was referred to two gentlemen of the law eminent for their abilities and not less so for their probity After examining all the proofs adduced by the rivals they adjudged that neither had any clame to the lordship so it is now left to the freeholders under our sovereign lord the king a rich tract for future inclosures  A LITTLE beyond  Kinsale  is the end of our parish on this side The boundary between it and the parish of  Holywell  is a small  ll called  Avon Marsh Siambr  AVON MARSH SIAMBR  Above on an eminence is the old seat of the  Pierces  a family now extinct and the property passed into other hands It bears the name of  Is Glan  from the name of the township in which it stands  ABOUT a mile higher up is  Merton  the seat of the Reverend Mr  John Foulkes  He derives his right to it from  Margaret  daughter and heiress to  Thomas Parry ap William Parry Wynne  She married  John Foulkes  of  Penyeba  luy  in the parish of  Shy  iog  greatgrandfather to the present owner who died in  July  and was interred in  Whiteford  churchyard  Tre Mostyn  bounds  Tre Bychton  on the west  TRE MOSTYN  This township is considered as containing one fourth of the parish It reaches to the seaside on which as well as the whole trees of every kind grow most admirably  IT is divided from  Tre Bychton  in the lower part by the turnpike road which extends from the seaside to  Henllan  sixteen miles distant originally designed for the conveyance of coal from the pits of this township and that of  Tre Bychton  to the great limeworks near  Denbigh  The first act was obtained in the second in before which our roads were scarcely passable If either Sir  Roger Mostyn  's family or our own wanted to get to  Chester  we were to reach the seaside then to  Flint  as we could and from thence at low water cross the ford of the  Dee  a way not always unattended with danger  OPPOSITE to  Mostyn  gates on this part of the turnpike road  THE RHEWL  is a hamlet called the  Rhewl yr Heol platea  a way or street On each side are a few houses The  Swan  a small alehouse my property was noted for its vast trade about the beginning of this century when the coal trade was in the height of its prosperity  And  Cw  w da  then unexcised by kings  Thomas Edwards  who several years was tenant there educated a family of numbers of children at no inconsiderable expence and is supposed to have acquired by the tap at lest fifteen hundred pounds  FROM the  Rhewl  opens the principal gates to  Mostyn  Hall  MOSTYN HALL  or more properly  Moston  Hall for such for many ages was the spelling of the names of both the mansion and its antient owners On this approach is a most venerable avenue which goes for a  considerable way in a direct line then turns short and terminates with a view of the old part of the old mansion The park is small but beautifully broken and cloathed in various parts with fine oaks and most magnificent beeches but amidst the trees is suffered to remain rugged with the vestiges of the antient collieries The ground slopes finely to the sea facing the North East The trees grow with vigor close to the water unhurt by the rude winds with which they are affailed  THE house is placed about half a mile from the shore I find some difficulty in making a description I shall therefore refer the reader to the first plate of  Welsh  seats by Mr  Boydel  and to my own as the only method of giving him some idea of the singularity of the structure That plate attempts the front  If front it might be call'd that shape had none  Distinguishable  For it consists of the most antient hall a lesser designed for a sort of  symposium  for servants and on the outside annexed and jutting out is the  quondam  chapel now converted into a bedchamber I have a sketch of the whole as it was in the year made by a Mr  Thomas Dinely  an attendant on  Henry  first duke of  Beaufort  then lord president of the council in the principality of  Wales  and lord lieutenant of the twelve counties who in that year made a reviewing progress of the militia of  North Wales  and of course paid his respects to the great man of our country  THE porch had been rebuilt in It has on it the arms of the four great alliances of the family rudely cut on the stone  MOSTYN HALL  They seem to have been copied from the great chimneypiece in the hall  I CANNOT trace the time of building of this part of the house It must have been at lest early in the time of  Henry  VI but probably more antient for in  Bolton  Hall in  Bowland Yorkshire  the most antique seat we know is a hall in a lesser scale indeed but greatly similar and in that house it is well known that the unfortunate prince concealed himself for a long time Posterity may find the account in my  Tour in Part of the  Mercian  and  Northumbrian  Kingdoms  The great gloomy hall is furnished with a  Dais  or elevated upper end  THE OLD HALL  and with a long table for the lord and his jovial companions and another in the side the seat of the inferior partakers of the good cheer To this day the similitude of the old times is kept up when the family is at home The head servants take their dinner at the  Dais  and the numerous inferior servants fill the long table The roof is lofty crossed with long beams The  nenbren  or topbeam was in all times a frequent toast whenever the master of the house's health was drank and '  Jached y nenbren y ty  ' was the cordial phrase The chimneypiece is magnificently plain unless where the arms of the house and its alliances are cut on the stone and properly emblazoned  THE first are the arms a lion rampant ermin  COATS OF ARMS  erminé of  Jevan Vychan  of  Pengwern  near  Llangollen  see  Tour in Wales  vol i p sixteenth in descent from  Owen Tudor  By the marriage of  Jevan  with  Angharad  daughter and sole heiress of  Howel ap Tudor ap Ithel Vychan  of  Mostyn  he added that estate to his paternal acres in the reign of  Richard  II  IT seems from the  Mostyn  pedegree that in  Jevan  had  farmed the estate He wisely determined to turn the lease into a perpetuity and

fourth are the arms of Sir  Gryffydd Lloyd Morfydd  one of his daughters and coheiresses married  Madoc Gloddaeth  who with her received  Tregarnedd  in the isle of  Anglesey  as her portion That estate followed the succession of the house till  Gloddaeth  was united with that of  Mostyn  in which it continued till the year then it was alienated by the late Sir  Thomas Mostyn  to the late Mr  Owen Williams  of  Anglesey  THE walls are furnished in a suitable manner with antient militia guns swords and pikes with helmets and breastplates with funeral atchievements  FALCON VAST FLIGHT OF ONE  and with variety of spoils of the chace A falcon is nailed against the upper end of the room with two bells a greater and a lesser hung to each foot On two silver rings are inscribed the name of the owner Mr  Kinloch  of  Kulrie  in the county of  Angus  on the Eastern side of  Scotland  With these incumbrances it flew from its owner on the morning of the th of  September  and was killed near this house on the  morning of the th The precise time it reached our country is not known therefore we are uncertain whether this bird exceeded in swiftness the hawk which flew thirty miles in an hour in pursuit of a woodcock or that which made a flight out of  Westphalia  into  Prussia  in a dayinstances recorded by the learned Sir  Thomas Brown  THE adjacent kitchen is overlooked by a gallery leading to the antient apartments of the lady of the house  KITCHEN  at a period when the odors of the pot and spit were thought no ill savors From the commanding height of the gallery the good lady might give her orders to her  Coges  or shecook as  Syrus  is humorously described by  Terence  to do to his scullion  Dromo    Let the great eel sport a little longer in the waterSee that you gut the

maidens of the family nightly repair to rest from their labors  AT one end of the gallery is a great room  GREAT ROOM  remarkable for a singular event During the time that  Henry  earl of  Richmond  was secretly laying the foundation of the overthrow of the house of  York  he passed concealed from place to place in order to form an interest among the  Welsh  who favored his cause on account of their respect to his grandfather  Owen Tudor  their countryman While  he was at  Mostyn  a party attached to  Richard  III arrived there to apprehend him He was then about to dine but had just time to leap out of a back window and make his escape through a hole which  HENRY VII  to this day is called the King's  Richard ap Howel  then lord of  Mostyn  joined  Henry  at the battle of  Bosworth  and after the victory received from the king in token of gratitude for his preservation the belt and sword he wore on that day he also pressed  Richard  greatly to follow him to court but he nobly answered like the  Shunamitish  woman  I dwell among mine own people  The sword and belt were preserved in the house till within these few years It is observable that none of our historians account for a certain period of  Henry  's life previous to his accession It is very evident that he passed the times when he disappeared from  Bretagny  in  Wales  Many cotemporary bards by feigned names record this part of his life under those of the LION the EAGLE and the like which were to restore the empire to the  Britons  for the inspired favorers of the house of  Lancaster  did not dare to deliver their verses in other than terms allegorical for fear of the reigning prince  SQUARE TOWER  IN all probability the original of  Mostyn  was a square tower such as may be exemplified entire at  Tower  the seat of the Reverend the late Dr  Wynne  see  Tour in Wales  ii p Part of that at  Mostyn  is still remaining but concealed by the additional buildings It is fully shewn in the view of  Mostyn  as it was in the year The upper part ought to have been embattled but the top had been in later times covered with an aukward dome These square towers are still very frequent on the borders of  Scotland  built in savage times as I have attempted to  MOSTYN as in  describe in my  Tour in Scotland  second edition volume ii p In the plate of  Mostyn  is given the view of the seat of a gentleman of large fortune in antient times In that of  Bychton  one of middling fortune In that of the late Mr  Parry  's of  Merton  one of small fortune As to our estate I think the rentroll in the year might amount to about  l  a year consisting of a little money and rents in kind and services  BEFORE I quit the old house let me say that the best view of the  chaotic  additions backward is from the garden from a very handsome summerhouse built by the first baronet as appears by his arms quartered with those of his wife  Bulkeley  of  Baron Hill  From this spot is seen great part of the buildings and the appurtenances to the old house one tacked to the other as the increase or the wants of the family made necessary  IN the year Sir  Roger Mostyn  knight  NEW HOUSE  gave to the house a very handsome addition a square mass consisting of six bedchambers a very large eatingroom and a diningroom or drawingroom above with a large bowwindow in the middle of each In that below are the arms of  Gwynne  and  D'Arcy  well emblazoned on glass These are complimentary to two great alliances the one of Sir  Roger  himself with  Mary  daughter of the famous Sir  John Wynne  of  Gwydir  the other out of respect to the alliance with  Bridget Savage  daughter of  D'Arcie Savage  esq  of  Leighton  in  Cheshire  by whom the family acquired the great estates they possess in that county From the principal gate of the park they have the pleasing view of those of  Beeston  and those above  Parkgate  OPPOSITE to this window is a fireplace suitable to the room Above are the arms of the numerous alliances of the house  beautifully done in stucco dated Conjoined with them are the arms of  Mary Wynne  wife of Sir  Roger  Those of  Gwydir  quarterly with those of  Gryffydd ap Conan  In the first of the  Mostyn  side are those of  Tudor Trevor  the stock of the house The next are those of  Llwdocca ap Carad  c  dly the arms of  Elidir ap Rhys Sais  thly those of  Jestyn ap Gurgant

The th of  Goodman  and thly and lastly the arms of  Shalmes  orow  which seem an appurtenance only to those of  Goodman  This is a mere focal ornament an abridgement of the thirtytwo coats which graced the pedegree of the house in the year Two  Termini  support the entablature of this genealogical table The other ornaments are elegant but unfortunately as if to dash the mirth of the company the architect has added in full view the monumental crossbones and bared skull  AT the upper end of the room are two fine portraits by  Mytens  full lengths One is of Sir  Roger Mostyn  knight mentioned at p His face is an excellent representation of the  viridis senectus  his countenance florid his peaked beard of strong whiteness On his head is a black close cap turned up with  Flanders  lace round his neck a flat large ruff his whole dress besides is black round the waistband of his great breeches is a girdle stuck with points This piece of magnificence gave rise to a very coarse proverb applicable to inferior people ambitious of acting beyond their station Round his knees are similar girdles  His boots are large and of white leather turned down at top and ornamented in the same finical manner as the cap such was the foppery of the times even in so manly a figure as was our knight of  Mostyn  But then he was in full dress his spurs of fine gold with vast spurleathers His right hand rests on his stick his left on a table covered with a carpet most admirably painted on it his hat broadbrimmed and with a most immoderate crown The date on his portrait is his age He died on  August  th and was interred at  Whiteford  on  September  the st  HIS lady's neck in a picture of the same date is ornamented with a large ruff single and elevated her right hand has in it a fan and rests on an elbowchair on a finger of her left hand is a ring tied to her arm by several black strings  SHE is dressed in a handsome long gown with a sash up to her very arms exactly like the nowaisted fair of the present days Her shape is contrived to have some degree of elegance notwithstanding she seems to have been a large woman I wish our modern  embonpoints  resembled this lady They seem to emulate in fashion the form of a sack of wool bulging out on every side undulating their plump graces here and there as motion gives occasion Over the mouth of the sack seems to have been oftimes flung by accident a light horseman's cap or any other incongruity instead of the venerable  coeffure  of the Lady  Mostyn  at the sober age of fortynine  HIS son  Roger  the first baronet created  August  d  SIR ROGER FIRST BARONET  is the middle figure of a picture of the most ridiculous composition This distinguished character is represented a kitkat length in a strange long flaxen wig a breastplate buff skirts and antique  Roman  sleeves a negro holding his helmet By him is his second lady  Mary  eldest daughter of  Thomas  lord  Bulkeley  of  Baron Hill  She is reading with one hand on a skull and her little lapdog placed by her warlike husband His third wife is doubled up and concealed behind the frame This lady shewed such a mercenary disposition and so mischievous to the children of her predecessor that one of the family affixed this stigma I have taken a peep at her and may pronounce her countenance to be truly symptomatic of her interior  SIR  Roger  was a zealous loyalist He raised a regiment in support of the crown consisting of fifteen hundred men in twelve hours time mostly colliers  Whitelock  whose sister had been married to Sir  Thomas Mostyn  of  Kilken  in this county knight father to Sir  Roger  speaks of him in the following terms notwithstanding their principles and the parts they took were widely different 'Then the parliament forces in ' says the historian at p  took in  Mostynhouse  belonging to colonel  Mostyn  the governor of  Flint  and in  Mostyn  they took four pieces of ordnance and some arms  THIS colonel  Mostyn  is my sister's son a gentleman of good parts and mettle of a very ancient family large possessions and great interest in that country so that in twelve hours he raised men for the king and was well beloved there living very nobly  THIS gentleman's loyalty cost him and the family dear He spent about sixty thousand pounds in the service of his majesty His house of  Mostyn  was plundered and stripped so that he was obliged to retire to a small house called  Plasycha  about a mile distant from  Mostyn  The first was built by his grandfather the  old baronet before mentioned within in coarse stucco are his arms with those of  Gwydir  and the date and initials of his and his lady's name'  R M M M  '  SIR  Roger  had a great intimacy with  Pyers Pennant  his cotemporary neighbor at  Bychton  Both seem

similar  BETWEEN them is a head of  Charles  II in his usual black wig He is well painted but without flattery His coarse features well vindicate the question he put to poor  Riley  the painter on

portraits shall be mentioned as they are placed At the upper end of the room is  Daniel  second earl of  Nottingham  sitting in his robes with a most enormous black wig flowing on each side almost to his waist his complexion suitably swarthy  THIS noble peer was painted by Sir  Godfrey Kneller  and was one of the few pictures which that unprincipled painter as Mr  Walpole  says would not gladly have disowned the moment it was paid for The earl of  Nottingham  was as  Dalrymple  represents him to have been most vehement in his political principles both in church and state so that he could hereby not live in charity with those who differed from him He undertook the defence of the former against the attack made upon it by the famous  Whiston  in a letter in addressed to his lordship which the earl answered for which his lordship received from the university of  Oxford  in full convocation its solemn thanks for his noble defence of the Christian faith He died  January  His zeal as Mr  Walpole  observes caused him during life to suffer many aspersions In all probability the following may have been one a stanza in the translation of the th Epistle lib ii of  Horace Ne sit ancillae tibi amor pudori  by the Earl of to the Earl of  S  Did not base  Greber  's  Pegg  inflame  The sober Earl of  Nottingham  Of sober fire descended  That careless of his soul and fame  To

the sum of thirty thousand pounds for permission to continue their fisheries In the next year the earl was constituted lord high admiral of  England  Lord  Clarendon  speaks of him when he was appointed privy counsel as if it was done for ornament He took in the consequent troubles a part adverse to the king But in he voted that his majesty's concessions were sufficient grounds for settling the peace of the kingdom The army soon settled that affair His lordship retired from the tyranny of the times became one of the instruments of the Restoration and died in  HE is painted as lord high

arms in stained glass  SIR ORLANDO BRIDGEMAN  THE first is of Sir  Orlando Bridgeman  a person eminent for his piety and charity in the reign of  Charles  I and his successor He was employed on the part of the king as one of the commissioners at the treaty of  Uxbridge  but fell under some censure in shewing a disposition to make concessions in church affairs  which were disagreeable to his majesty Yet lord  Clarendon  in his own Life i attributes them more to a timidity of disposition than to any ill design At the Restoration he was successively made chief baron of the exchequer chief justice of the common pleas and at length lordkeeper of the great seals He ended his days in  THE arms of  Cadifod ap Dyfnwal  quartered with several coats of arms of the great men in  South Wales

same year so it seems to have been an improving age  LIBRARY  AT one end of this building is the library a room most unworthy of the valuable collection of manuscripts and books it contains Few if any can boast of the number or beauty of the first especially the illuminated and I suspect that the number rarity and value of the antient classics medallic histories gems and variety of every species of polite literature is without parallel They are of the scarcest editions and printed by the most esteemed printers I am indebted to Mr  Edward Clarke  A M of  Jesus  college  Cambridge  for a select catalogue of the most valuable manuscripts and books The articles mentioned are attended with our joint notes but my share must candidly be confessed to have been the smallest Mr  Clarke  may be said to be a scholar  ex traduce  His mother  was daughter to the Rev Dr  William Wotton  famous for having given a translation of the laws of  Howel Dda  His grandfather WILLIAM CLARKE M A was still more eminent He assisted  Wotton  in his labors by a most learned and elegant  Latin  preface to the  Leges Wallicae  But his name will be for ever delivered to posterity for his celebrated treatise  The Connection of the Roman Saxon and English Coins  printed in by his friend Mr  William Bowyer  Neither must I be silent in respect to Mr  Clarke  's father who favored the world with a very ingenious account of  Spain  where he had resided some time under the patronage of the earl of  Bristol  the  British  minister at the court of  Madrid  THE late Sir  Thomas Mostyn  may be said to have been the

way to the  Lateran  church between the  Coliseum  and  St Clement  's church attended by two cardinals preceded by a white friar and followed by a numerous concourse of mob This celebrated Popess if such there ever was is said to have been a  German  girl who had assumed the habit of our sex went to  Athens  to study and made such a progress as to be the astonishment of every body By what steps she rose to the papacy I am not told She attained it in and discharged all the duties of it under the name of  John  VIII She unfortunately proved a frail mortal Her holiness had an intrigue and the consequences appeared as related Unable to bear the shame she died on the spot This affair gave occasion to a thousand controversies which side had the right is little worth enquiry Mr  Misson  enters

magnificence but more so for a singular  erratum  It was printed by  Basket  at the  Clarendon  press in in two vast volumes It is adorned with a frontespiece and various headpieces from paintings by Sir  James Thornhill  and others engraven by  Vander Gutch de Bosche  c The ridiculous mistake is in the runningtitle to the twentieth chapter of St  Luke  in which 'Parable of the vineyard' is printed 'Parable of the  vinegar  ' and on that account the edition is better known by the name of the  Vinegar Bible  than any other  Antiquities in the Mostyn Library  BRONZES    Isis  nursing the infant  Orus  a figure six inches in height  ISIS  For a description of which see  Montfaucon  vol ii chap pl fig  A FEMALE figure rising from the bath  A FEMALE RISING FROM THE BATH  adjusting her hair before a mirror which she holds in her right hand while the left is employed in arranging her waving tresses The legs of this beautiful little bronze have been restored The rest of the figure is remarkable for its symmetry and elegance  THE eagle of  Jupiter  with extended pinions  JUPITER'S EAGLE  retaining the thunder in its claws This has been suspended as a vow at the shrine of that deity The same figure often occurs upon the antient lamps as will be shewn hereafter  Montfaucon  has given  an exact representation of this figure in vol i pl It there forms the principal ornament of a bronze lamp and over it is this inscription  L  TETIUS  ALYPUS  JOVI D D    IMAGE of  Os  ris  the tutelar deity of the  Nile  according to Mr  Bruce  the personified representation of the dogstar For an account of this god see  Montfaucon  tom ii chap  LLUS  THE PHALLUS certainly intended as a pendant for the ear With the ancients it was a symbol of secundity  Herodotus  mentions its having been carried in solemn procession at the sacrifices of  Bacchus Athenaeus  speaks of one carried in this manner which was twenty cubits long and formed entirely of gold It was moreover adorned with garlands which were twined round to its vertex where was a golden star six cubits in circumference See  Athen  lib v c At  Isernia  a province in the kingdom of the two  S  cilies  the women annually celebrate the anniversary of their patron saint by offering at his shrine  ex voto  of wax representing the male organs of generation which they style St  Cosmus  's toes Sir  W Hamilton  addressed a letter to the  Dilettanti  society upon this curious circumstance which he accompanied with different specimens of the usual offerings This letter gave birth to a very learned and ingenious essay by Mr  Knight  on the ancient worship of  Priapus  written at the request of the society and partially distributed for their use In the course of this work  Mr  Knight  thus expresses himself  Whatever the  Greeks  and  Egyptians  meant by the symbol in question it was certainly nothing ludicrous or licentious of which we need no other proof than its having been carried in solemn procession at the celebration of those mysteries in which the first principles of their religion the knowledge of the God of nature the FIRST the SUPREME the INTELLECTUAL v  Plut  de ls Os were preserved from the vulgar superstitions and communicated under the strictest oaths of secrecy to the initiated who were obliged to purify themselves prior to their initiation by abstaining from  venery and all impure food  I FIND this detestable worship among the  Gentoos  in  Indostan  Captain  Alexander Hamilton  in his account of the  East Indies  i p gives the following relation  In all this tract between  Gamgam  and  Jagarnaut  the visible god in most esteem is  Gopalsami  whose temples are decorated with obscene representations of men and women in indecent postures also of demons and cacodemons whose shameful parts are of a prodigious size in proportion to their bodies This filthy image is worshipped by the heathens of both sexes but barren women are his greatest devotees and bring him the best oblations  THE HOGSKIN  Mo  o    iii part i tab  A vow to  Bacchus  A HOGSKIN  The custom of preserving wine in hogskins is still observed in  Spain  and many other parts of the world The antients retained the form of it in their domestic utensils and vessels of libation long after the  se of it had been superseded by the more convenient  amphora  PATERA  AN instrument of sacrifice by some falsely called a  patera Montfaucon  has proved that these instruments round flat having no cavity to contain the liquor are not  paterae Beger  supposes them to be what  Isidorus  calls  apophereta  which were used as plates to hold fruit and other viands  Apophereta a ferendo poma vel aliud nominata est enim plana  See  Montfaucon  tom ii pl fig  THE  paterae  were very different from those designed for festive purposes The latter were rich goblets or a species of tankard  Montfaucon  has in vol iii part p to p engraven several kinds  Virgil  in describing  Dido  's royal feast says  Implevit mero pateram  After the fair queen had made a delicate libation she presented the goblet to the jovial  Trojan Bitias  who drank it up at one tip The Poet describes it most humorously and emphatically  Tum  Bit  e  dedit increpitans ille impiger hausit  Spumantem pateram et pleno se  proluit  auro  A SPECULUM  A SPECULUM or mirror of some metallic substance at this day retaining a polish equal to the first telescope reflector Bishop  Watson  in his  Chemical Essays  vol iii p has given a pretty comment on the composition of these  specula  'Copper' says the ingenious prelate  communicates a smell both to gold and silver The  Roman specula  which they used as lookingglasses in  Pliny  's time were commonly made of silver but the silver was alloyed with much copper for we  find a cunning waitingmaid in  Plantus  advising her mistress to wipe her fingers after having handled a  speculum  least her paramour should suspect her of receiving silver from some other lover  Ut speculum tenuisti metue ne oleant argentum manus  Ne usque argentum te accipisse suspicitur  Philolocles  THE STRIGIL a crooked instrument for scraping the muscles  A STRIGIL  It was in high request among the  Romans Montfaucon  gives the figures of several Among others he has pourtrayed a man of rank in the bath while two boys are seen on each side of him using the  strigil  This instrument is very common on all the  Greek  vases and is always represented among the ceremonies of the bath  A COMB exactly resembling those now in use This also formed a necessary article among the bathing apparatus  A COMB  A SMALL spicebox of the same nature as those found at  Pompeia  A BRACELET for the arm  BRACELET  These are frequently found in  Greek  sepulchres and in the excavations at  Herculaneum  and  Pompeia  AN intaglio ring beaded round the work very coarse  RING  and altogether in the  Egyptian  style  ARM of the  Discobolus  ARM OF A DISCOBOLUS  in the act of throwing the

figure formed of blue antique paste  ANOTHER  of the same kind which the ancients used in their  Mosaics  known to  Italians  by the name of  fritta  This figure is also covered with hieroglyphics  TO these may be added others which I have described in the first volume of my  Tour in Wales  Those which are foreign are several marbles brought from  Narbonne  the  Narbo Martius  NARBONNE MARBLES  It is one of the most ancient cities in  Gaul  for it was a flourishing place two hundred and eighty years before the  Christian  era A  Roman  colony was established there in the time of  Marcius Rex  from whom it received its addition It is full of antiquities which have been used in the various modern buildings Those in question came from the walls of the archbishop's palace and were brought here by the late Sir  Thomas Mostyn  The engraving  with the inscriptions taken from the d volume of my  Tour  gives a full idea of these funebrial memorials  TORQUES  THE golden  torques  that invaluable morsel in possession of this family was found by digging in a garden near to  Harlech  castle in It is well described by  Camden  as a wreathed rod of gold about four feet long with three spiral furrows with sharp intervening ridges running its whole length to the ends which are plain truncated and turn back like pothooks Whether this was purely  Roman  or whether it might not have been common to both nations I will not dispute The use was that of a baldric to suspend gracefully the quiver of men of rank which hung behind by means of the hook and the golden wreath crossed the breast and passed over the shoulder  Virgil  in his beautiful description of the exercises of the  Trojan  youth expresses the manner in these frequently misconstrued lines  Cornea bina ferunt prae  ixo hastilia ferro  Pars leves  umer  pharetras ait pectore summo  Flexilis obt  rti per collum circulus auri  Each brandishing aloft a cornel spear  Some on their backs their burnish'd quiver bore  Hanging from wreaths of gold which shone before  THE  torch  or  torques  worn by the  Gauls  and  Britons  was a very different affair a collar of gold or other metal worn round the neck Our heroine  Boadicea  had a great one of that precious metal and  Virdomaerus  wore round his neck another fastened behind with hooks which fell off when the conqueror cut off his head  AN APOPHERETA  Illi virgatis jaculanti ex agmine braccis  Torquis ab incisa decidi  unca gula  Manlius  acquired the addition of  Torquatus  from a  torques  which he won from a  Gaul  whom he flew in single combat in sight of the army and  Publius Cornelius  after the slaughter of the  Boii  took among other spoils not fewer than four thousand and seventy golden torques  THEY were also in use among the  Romans  who bestowed them as military rewards and as  Pliny  pretends the golden on the auxiliaries the silver on the citizens They probably were made in several ways I have seen a very beautiful one I think at present in possession of the Rev Mr  Prescot  of  Stockport  composed of several links of silver wire most elegantly twisted together it was long enough to go twice round the neck and had clasps which fastened it on  THE custom of wearing the  torques  was continued from the more remote periods of  Britain  to later times  Llewellyn  a lord of  Yale  was called  Llewelyn aur Dorchog  Llewelyn with the golden torques' on that account and the common proverb  Mi a dynna'r dorch a chwi  I will pluck the  torques  with you  signifies to this day a hard struggle of a person before he would yield a victory  THE next antiquity is as to material  British  COPPER CAKE  as to its destination  Roman  I refer to the cake of copper smelted at the antient  Conovium  the modern  Caerbên  near to  Conwy  which probably was smelted from the ore of the  Snowdon  hills where of late years much has been got This mass is in shape of a cake of beeswax  on the upper part is a deep concave impression with the words '  Se  o Romae  To my partner at  Rome  ' across these is impressed obliquely in lesser letters  Na  ol  I cannot explain it unless  N  stands for  Na    the people who paid this species of t  bute and  sol  for  that being the stampmaster's mark These cakes might be bought up by a merchant resident in  Britain  and consigned  'to his partner at  Rome  ' The weight of this antiquity is fortytwo pounds the diameter of the upper part eleven inches the thickness in the middle two and three quarters  SILVER HARP  THE silver harp is purely  British  both as to the metal and the use which with the commission for holding an  Eisteddfod  or sessions of bards at  Ca  wis  in is still in possession of Sir  Roger Mostyn  The harp from time immemorial had been in the gift of his ancestors to give as a temporary mark of excellency on the chief of the faculties or those who had excelled in their different ways poetical or musical I shall only present the reader with the copy of the patent to Sir  Richard Bulkeley  knight and to  William Moston  and many others  William Moston  is the gentleman mentioned at p This commission is in some measure historical but the reader who wishes for a

pencil twentytwo inches by fifteen It formerly hung in the approach to the chapel and was brought there by the lady of Sir  Thomas Mostyn  the second baronet That lady as I have before mentioned was a

miniature painting  OF the seven churches in the hundred of  Coleshill  part of the  S  n dis  ros Wisford  as it is called in the  Doomsday Book  is one The name was changed to  Whiteford  of derivation unknown In the  Doomsday Book  notice is also taken of some of the present townships such as  TreMostyn TreBychton  and  M  ton  under the names of  Mostone Widford Putecaine  and  Mer  tone M  stone  was then a ploughland  terra unius carucae  It had on it four villeyns and eight boors  Bordarii  a wood a league long and forty perches  perticatae  broad and was valued at twenty shillings  Widford  is joined with  Putecaine  the first seems to have comprehended our present  Tre  lan  or the place where the churchvillage now stands These had one plough land two villeyns and twelve others between men and maid servants fisheries and a wood half a mile long and forty perches broad the value was the same with that of  Mostone  WITH  Mereton  is joined the third part of  Widford  and the  Berewicha  or hamlet of  Caldecote  the last at present a township of the parish of  Holywell  In this division was a presbyter a church and six villeyns Here was a wood half a mile

churches in our country were placed under her patronage and thirteen wakes kept on that day The living is a rectory a sinecure which with the vicarage is in the gift of the bishop of  St Asaph  The church consists of a nave with a good plain towersteeple It has besides a side aile built by a  Blithyn Drow  of the house of  Mostyn  to whom that part belongs  DIVINE service is performed every  Sunday  alternately in  Welsh  and in  English  At the first the congregation is very numerous and at all times truly serious and devout The dress of even the poorest neat and whole and very unlike the squalid ragged figures too frequently seen in the congregations of many a southern county  OFFERINGS at funerals are kept up here and I believe in all the  Welsh  churches A disgusting and in cases in which the deceased may have died of an infectious distemper a dangerous custom often prevales of the corpse being brought into church during divine service and left there till the congregation is dismissed  THAT excellent  memento  to the living the  passingbell  is punctually sounded I mention this because idle niceties have in great towns often caused the disuse It originated before the Reformation to give notice to the priest to be ready to do the last duty of extreme unction to the departing person in case he had no other admonition The canon allows one short peal after death one other before the funeral and one other after the funeral The second is still in use and is a single bell  s  ed The third is a merry peal rung at the request of the  s  if  like they

is an imperfect table of benefa  tors The ann  al revenue in interest and land is  l  yet the poor's rates are alarmingly high In the beginning of the present century poor rates had not taken place Collections were made in the church for the sick and the aged Filial piety had at that time f  possession of the breasts of the children or great affection the part of more distant relations and the pangs of p  verty were as much as possible alleviated There was also a laudable p  in them which made them above suffering their friends to be a burden to their fellow parishioners all this gradually ceased and the warmth of natural affection soon quite disappeared I cannot but mention an instance of the rapid increase of taxes in my days In the year  William Lloyd  smith was one of the overseers of the poor at that time the annual tax was only      c    d  He was appointed again overseer in the year  when the tax was increased to  l William Lloyd  is now living but the books prove the exactness of the assertion  SCHOOL  IN the village is the school It was founded by  Mary Bradshaw  widow of  Thomas Williams  of  Mostyn Gate  who bequeathed by will dated the interest of  l  to be paid to the master of the said school for instructing for ever annually fourteen children who are instructed in reading and writing  English  and  accounts The present schoolhouse was built by  Pyers Jones  an opulent farmer of this parish who also bestowed a very handsome brass chandelier on the church  IN this and a few other of the mineral parishes  CLUB  is a  Cymdeithos  or club instituted in for the support of the members in case of illness or any accidents provided they are not contracted by intemperance fighting or any immoral act Our club consists of members each of whom contributes monthly  d  which is put into a box locked with three keys two are kept by the stewards and the third by the person to whom the box is intrusted so that all three must be present at the taking out or putting in of any money The club has been of late years fortunate enough to have saved three hundred pounds which is put out on good security and kept in reserve against any calamitous times such as seasons of sickness or uncommon successions of accidents  IN case of illness a certain allowance is made till the time of their recovery or till they are deemed incurable In the last case they are allowed two shillings and six pence for life In case of death forty shillings is paid for funeral expences and a sum to the widow proportionable to the time the husband had been member of the club  WHENEVER the business requires a meeting the steward must bring with him the tankard of ale and a very small cup in order that the members may not exceed the bounds of temperance  IF any member comes to the club in liquor he forfeits twopence if he speaks ill of government or abuses any body or curses and swears or will not hold his tongue when required by  the stewards he forfeits twopence for every offence In a word every caution is observed to preserve the rules of morality in this our paroc  al society Finally there is a great annual meeting on  NewYear's Day  in which every member attends Every one appears neatly dressed carrying a wand gally painted and make altogether a most respectable figure ranged in two lines from the porch door to that of the church  I STEP into the churchyard and sigh over the number of departed which f  ll the inevitable retreat In no distant time the north side like those of all other  Welsh  churches was through some superstition to be

his humble station and every duty of life He discharged so fully That when the day sh  ll come which levels all distinction of ranks He may By the favor of our blessed Mediator hear these joyful words "Well done thou good and faithful servant enter thou into the joy of thy Lord" He was born at St  Hermes de Rouvelle  in  Normandy August  died at  Downing August  and was interred in the Churchyard near this wall on the d of the same month  The wealth which  Louis  had acquired was considerable Above sixteen hundred pounds passed through my hands He had besides a thousand pounds which a setter to an attorney prevaled on the good man to sink with the man of the law for an annuity Death soon put the lawyer in possession of the principal I lament this for I had been left by him residuary legatee and sole executor with a power to dispose of the remainder all legacies paid in charitable uses Thus a thousand pounds were lost to  Whiteford  parish The interest of the remainder is quarterly divided among the worthiest of our poor who may annually bless so excellent a benefactor  Louis  was bred a  Roman  catholic and notwithstanding he occasionally frequented the prayers of our church he chose to be buried according to the rites of those of  Rome  which were performed  in a room in my house He left twenty pounds to the gentleman who performed the service I fixed on the Reverend  Philip Jones  who had in this neighborhood near fifty years discharged his function in a manner truly exemplary I took up the old custom of attending a faithful friend to his grave a respect the excellency of his conduct clamed from me  NEAR to the tomb of  Nicolas Pennant  is another in memory of  Hugh Pennant  son and heir of  Robert Pennant  of  Downing  see p who was buried  August  th with this best of characters  He lived honestly and hurt nobody He gave every one his due  NEAR to this place tumbled on the ground  PIERCES OF YSGLAN  is a stone in memory of a  Pierce  of  Ysglan  in this parish a respectable family now extinct descended from  Ednowen Bendew  The crest of this family is a boar's head marked with a crescent a sign of its having been a second branch On a board I have of the arms of the house I see it had been allied with numbers of reputable families among others I venture to reckon that of  Bychton  I MIGHT mention other tombs of the men of property in our parish who in less luxurious times lived in hospitality till infected with those fiends luxury and ostentation they soon became swallowed up in the greater estates  BENEATH the venerable shade of two great yews  OF THE FOULKE  's  our  Baucis  and  Philemon  is the tomb which preserves the memory of  Margaret Parry  heiress of  Merton  see p the seat of our hospitable  vicar the Rev Mr  John Foulkes  The epitaph gives the descent  Hic jacet corpus  Margarettae Parry  filiae  The Parry  filn̄ heredis  Gu    Parry  et nuper uxor  Joh Fo  lkes  quae sepulta est die  Julii    Hic jacet corpus  Guilidmi Parry Wynne  de  Mertyn isgl    Junii  et sepultus die  Junii  Id  THIS at present is the tomb of the family of Mr  Foulkes  of  Merton  On the top are cut as I suppose the arms of the family from whom he derives his right quarterly for his first coat a stag by which I imagine that the bearer derived his descent from  Hedd Molwynog  lord of  Uwch Aled  and one of the fifteen tribes and cotemporary with  Dafydd ap Owen Gwynedd  If the reader will give himself the trouble of turning to p of the second volume of my  Welsh Tour  he will find a recital of the great deeds of the house  O  WILLIAMS  THE next is the place of interment of  Peter Williams  of  Merton Ysglan  who died  January  th  HIS arms shew him to have derived his descent from the abovementioned  Ednowen Bendew  quarterly with those of  Edwyn  lord of  Tegengl  The family fell to decay and the part of the estate which lay in our parish was purchased by my father and the name changed to that of  Kinsale  see p from the late owner having made that place his residence  THE following quaint rhyme on another gravestone may conclude with much propriety this part of the funebrial subject  Vita caduca vale  Vita

Maenan  who died a youth  June  d at  Bychton  on a visit to his sister  Jane  wife to  Pyers Pennant  THE next township to the village is in  Whitford Garn  GARREG  In this township is  Garreg  or  The Rock  the highest land in the parish it is a large inclosed hill the property of Sir  Roger Mostyn  Part of it is a fine turf and excellent sheepwalk  the summit and part of the sides rocky From  Whiteford  to the top is a continual ascent From this height the traveller may have an august foresight of the lofty tract of  Snowdon  from the crooked  Moel Shabog  at one end to the towering  Penmaenmawr  at the other of the vast promontory of  Llandudno  and part of the isle of  Anglesea  with the great bay of  Llanddulas  forming an extensive crescent the estuaries of the  Dee  and the  Mersey  and to the  North  at times the isle of  Man  and the  Cumberland Alps  the frequent presages of bad weather  PHAROS  THE  Romans  took advantage of this elevated situation and placed on its summit a  Pharos  to conduct the navigators to and from  Deva  along the difficult channel of the  Seteia Portus  The building is still remaining It is tolerably entire its form is circular the inner diameter twelve feet and a half the thickness of the walls four feet four inches The doors or entrances are opposite to each other over each is a square funnel like a chimney which opens on the outside about halfway up the building On each side is a window About four feet from the ground are three circular holes lined with mortar as is frequent in  Roman  buildings and penetrate the whole wall for purposes now unknown  WITHINSIDE are the vestiges of a staircase which led to the floors of which there appear to have been two Along such part of the upper which was conspicuous from the channel are eight small square openings cased with freestone the rest of the building being of rude limestone bedded in hard mortar and each of these were separated by wooden pannels placed in deep grooves the last still in a perfect state In each of these  partitions were placed the lights which the  Romans  thought necessary to keep distinct or to prevent from running into one lest they should be mistaken by seamen for a star  Periculum in corrivatione ignium ne sidus existimetur  TO the building is very evidently a broad and raised road pointing from the east and near its upper end are the marks of a trench which surrounded and gave protection to this useful edifice It certainly had in later times been repaired or perhaps applied to some other use for in one part is a piece of timber which could not have been aboriginal  THE curious cross called  Maen Achwynfan  MAEN ACHWYNFAN  or the stone of lamentation stands in a small field opposite to the gate which opens from the turnpikeroad into  Garreg  It takes its name in all probability from the penances which were often finished before such sacred pillars attended with weeping and the usual marks of contrition for an example near  Stafford  stood one called the  weeping cross  a name analogous to ours This is of an elegant form and sculpture is twelve feet high two feet four inches broad at the bottom and ten inches thick The base is let into another stone The top is round and includes in raised work the form of a  Greek  cross Beneath about the middle is another in the form of St  Andrew  's and under that a naked figure with a spear in his hand Close to that on the side of the column is represented some animal The rest is covered with very beautiful fretwork like what may be seen on other pillars of antient date in several parts of  Great Britain  I do not presume after the annotator on  Camden  has given up the point to attempt a guess at the age only must observe that  it must have been previous to the reign of gross superstition among the  Welsh  otherwise the sculptor would have employed his chizzel in striking out legendary stories instead of the elegant knots and interlaced work that cover the stone  THOSE who suppose it to have been erected in memory of the dead slain in battle on the spot draw their argument from the number of adjacent tumull containing human bones and sculls often marked with mortal wounds but these earthy sepulchres are of more antient times than the elegant sculpture of this pillar will admit This likewise from the crosses is evidently a  Christian  monument The former were only in use in pagan days  GELLI  THERE is likewise near to it an antient chapel now a farmhouse called  Gelli  or the  Hazelgrove  the name of an adjacent tract This might have relation to the cross as well as a place for performance of divine service to the abbot of  Basingwerk  who had a house at no great distance This tract misspelt by the  English Geteley  with the wood at that time on it was granted by  Edward  I to the abbot and convent on the tenth of  November  at  Westminster  before the death of our last prince He also gave him power to grub up the wood which by the nakedness of the place appears to have been done most effectually  FARTHER to the west is another inclosed mountain called  Glol  my own property part is covered with hazels and large whitethorn trees perhaps a continuation of the  Gelli  part is very  cky part a fine sheepwalk In many places were several druidical circles which I believe are now injured by the removal of the stones for various uses In the rougher parts of  this inclosure are often seen vipers which always prefer the dry and sunny parts of a country  ON  SarnHwlkin  a little common to the east of  Glol  SARNHWLKIN  was a very long but low  tumUlus  supposed by the vulgar to have been a  giant's grave  from a tradition that one of our sons of  Anak  had been there interred It probably did cover the remains of some  British  heroes of the common size who there found their grave after some fierce action I have before supposed to have happened before the place  THE township of  Tre'rAbbot  TRE'RABBOT  one of the eight which compose our parish joins to this part of  TreMostyn  In it stands the house of the same name originally the countryseat of the abbots of  Basingwerk  but long since the property of the  Davies's  lately sold to  Edward Jones  of  Wepre  esq  From the proof that gentleman has given of his literary abilities in drawing up the resolutions of the  Holywell  association in  December  I must lament they are not oftener exerted the occasion alone excepted  THIS township was once exempted from the payment of tythes by a  modus  originally granted by the abbot of  Basingwerk  but which by negligence has been totally lost  THE house in Mr  Miles Davies  MILES DAVIES  produced a very extraordinary genius indeed The talents of this eccentric gentleman were poetical He lived about the year and published three volumes of his  Athenae Britannicae  In his  Martii Calendae sive laudes Cambro Britanniae  is a  Latin  poem on  St David's Day  I never could get the sight of the books but was indebted to the Rev  William Cole  late of  Milton  near  Cambridge  for the following extract which will I dare say content the reader as it does me  Roberto

Tegen  or  TegenMountain  which yet preserves the antient name of  Tegengl  which comprehended the three modern hundreds of  Coleshill Prestatyn  and  Rudland  It had been the property of  Edwin  descended from  Roderick  the Great and called prince of  Tegengl  His  Llys  or royal residence was in near  Llaneurgan  or  Northop  This common for I cannot call it mountain stretches along the whole of the higher parts of our parish and is covered with the  erica vulgaris  or common heath It feeds numbers of sheep and is part of the mineral tract of  Flintshire  LLYN HELYG  THE manor of  Mostyn  of which Sir  Roger Mostyn  is lord includes the greater part of the mountain and reaches to the sea It was derived from the heiress of the house descended from her ancestor prince  Edwin  A LARGE piece of water now well stocked with fish made by Sir  Roger Mostyn  baronet grandfather to the present owner  lies near that end of the heath In the winter it is the resort of ducks and teal  ON the eastside of  Mostyn  pool in  Tegen  mountain  PLAS CAPTAIN  is a grave bounded at each end by a rude stone above four feet high It contains the remains of captain  Edward Morgan  of the adjacent house of  Plâs Captain  and of the respectable family of the  Morgans  of  Gwlgray  in the adjoining parish of  Llan Asaph  Some years ago a person of strange curiosity opened the grave and found the skeleton On the head was a red cap I think of velvet and round his neck a silk handkerchief By him lay his sword and his helmet and beneath the skeleton two bullets which had fallen out of the body on its dissolution all which verify the report of his having been slain in battle or in some skirmish during the civil wars and that he was interred according to his wish under the spot on which he fell In a collection of pedegrees lent to me by  Thomas Gryffith  esq  of  Rhual  I find this short memorial of the captain in the pedegree of his family 'Capt  Edward Morgan  slain at  Cheshire  raise' If he was slain in that county I cannot suppose that his body would have been carried so far nor can I account for this relation or for the body being found here unless that the above is a mistake and that he fell in some skirmish near to his own house  AT a small distance from  Plâs Captain  is  Plâsmawr  at present the property of Sir  Edward Price Lloyd  bart of  Pengwern  in right of his worthy grandmother  Frances  daughter and heiress to  Bell Jones  secretary in the civil board of ordnance in the Tower He erected a handsome monument in  Whiteford  church in memory of his father  Robert Jones  and others of his predecessors  He died and was buried in the chapel of the Tower aged near the remains of his wife  Frances  who died  November  th aged  ABOUT a mile farther the turnpike which is named the  Flint  road cresses the upper road from  Newmarket  to  Holywell  IT is the first turnpike known on the  Holyhead  road The act was obtained in and contained besides the district of  Flint  those of  E  mere Chester  and  Mold  The part in question is called  Llwybrhir  or the  longpath  for it extends along the mountain westward as far as  Brickkiln  USUSES  ON the right hand as you pass towards that hamlet on a rocky elevated part called  Gelli  is a multitude of loose stones lying on the surface They are of the limestone kind mere  l  es  assuming most singular forms some are excavated and often perforated This must have been done when they were in a soft state for since their formation nothing has fallen on them but the rain of heaven and that could not effect the phenomenon  ENTRENCHMENT  SCATTERED over this part of the mountain are several rounded  tumuli  and to the le  t at some distance is a work probably coeval with them On the slope of the west part of the raceground is an entrenchment of a circular form about a hundred and sixtythree feet in diameter surrounded with a low bank and on the outside of that with a ditch in one part very shallow in the other more deep This circle could not have been designed as a post or place of retreat from an enemy Its entrenchment is weak and it might easily be commanded from above by the risingground Possibly it might have been for some religious purpose or for a place of council or for haranguing  the people who might assemble round the outside and readily hear what was delivered to them  ON returning along  Llwybrhîr  I rejoin the  Newmarket  road  LLWYBRHÎR  at the pla  d had left it near a great inclosure belonging to Sir  Roger M    called  Tymaen  Within near to the road  TYMAEN  is a great mount now planted with firtrees the site of a castelet probably a seat of  Owen Bendew  EDNOWEN BENDEW  which my friend and fellowtraveller the late Rev  John Lloyd  supposed to have been one of the habitations of that chieftain  Owen  was lord of  Tegengl  in and one of the fifteen tribes of  North Woles  He was distinguished by the name of  Pendew  or  Bendew  I have consulted  Davies  's and all our dictionaries and can find no other translation of the word than  Thickscull  Of him are descended as the MS of the Rev  Lewis Owen  my authority say many worthy families among them  Ithel ap Rotpert  archdeacon of  Tegengl  who was living in the years and and the  Bithels  and a great many families besides I might venture to mention the living descendants of the great  Bendew  for the unfortunate idea of character impressed by the  cognomen  is entirely worn out They are only to be known by their arms argent three boars heads couped a  chevron  sable  THE extinct families were the  Wynnes  of  Galedlom  and  Caerwis Piers  of  Llanasaph  and of  Merton Ysglan  and the  Williams's  of  Merton  both of the parish of  Whiteford  the  Parrys  of  Coleshill  and  Basingwerk  the  Ffachnalts  of  Ffachnalts  in the parish of  Mold  and the  Griffiths  of  Pant  y Llo  wndŷ  in  Llanhasa  parish and  Griffiths  of  Caerwis  hall all of whom are now extinct unless it may be in the female line  GO  SEDDAU  A LITTLE farther on the left on the common are two raised mounts of a conoid shape called  Gorseddau  a name common to all of the same kind According to our learned  Rowlands  see p it is derived from the custom which the  Druids  had of fitting aloft on them when they pronounced their sentences and made their solemn orations to the people '  Multa  ' says  Caesar 'de Decrum immortalium vi et potestate disputant et juventute tradunt  ' The custom of promulging the laws in the  Isle of Man  from their  Tinwald  a larger but similar mount has its origin in  Druidism  A certain officer takes the place of the  Druid  and makes known to the people who stand beneath the institution of the new law  PENFFORDD Y WAEN  ON the mountain opposite to the place called  Penffôrdd ŷ Waen  are other remains of the antient  Britons  one or two  tumuli  and near one of them an upright stone and a little farther is another its  tumulus  possibly destroyed These are the  Meini Gwŷr Meini Hirion  and  Lleche  differently denominated in different places These were sometimes memorials of great events sometimes monumental as in the present case There are illustrations of both in the book of  Genesis  ch xxxvvv On the pillar which  Jacob  erected after he had the gracious favor of conversing with the Deity face to face he made a libation of oil on that raised on the grave of his wife  Rachel  he omitted that respect  I NOW advance towards my conclusion and shall attempt the more interesting topics of the rural oeconomy of my native parish and its mineral and commercial advantages In respect  to size and population it may rank among the most important in this division of our principality  IT is bounded on the east by the  Chester Channel  BOUNDARIES OF THE PARISH  the  Seteia Aestuarium  of  Ptolemy  Its inhabitants at that time were the  Ordovices  but whether in so long a period any of the antient blood at present runs in our veins is extremely uncertain The southern boundary of this parish is that of  Holywell  the northern those of  Llan Asaph Newmarket  and  Cwm  and the western those of  Tremerchion  and  Caerwis  THE whole length of the parish from its eastern extremity  LENGTH  not far from  Holloway  turnpikegate to the extremity of the township  Tre'rAbbot  is about four miles two furlongs Its greatest breadth from the seaside near  Llanerchymôr  to  Foelda  adjoining to  Yskiviog  parish is near three miles four furlongs The northern part which is its length is in general a rapid descent of two miles three quarters and yards reckoning from  Penyffordd Waen  to  Llanerchymôr  All beyond to the south and to the west is  Tegen  mountain or the old  Tegenia  a large extent of plain swelling into gentle risings covered chiefly with heath and mixed with grass unless where the limestone stratum appears above the surface  BEING on the spot  MINERALS  I shall give first some account of our minerals the source of wealth to the landowner and of wealth but oftener poverty to the adventurous miners who like adventurers in a lottery to which miners may truly be compared are tempted by the good fortune of others to risque and frequently lose their all If they are successful they never th  k of a future day but enjoy their fortune in good living forgetfull  of the pains it cost them till all is gone and they are again compelled to take to hard labor After a life of dissipation they sink under the fatigue lose their health and early become a burthen to the community by adding to the load of paupers under which it groans  WORKED BY THE ROMANS  THE want of gunpowder in early times with the  Romans  was a great impediment Instead we find that great fires were used the rock intensely heated and cracks formed in it by the sudden infusion of water  Pliny  says of vinegar The wedge or pickax was then insinuated into the apertures and the stone or ore forced out Miners often discover the marks of fire in antient mines I am in possession of a little wedge five inches and a quarter long presented to me by the late Mr  Smedley  of  Bagillt Hall  discovered in working the deep fissures of  Dalar Goch  rock in the parish of  Diserth  in this county This little instrument affords a proof of its antiquity by being almost intirely incrusted with lead ore It had probably lain in the course of some subterraneous stream which had brought along with it the leaden particles and deposited them on the iron  THEIR TOOLS  PICKAXIS of an uncommon bulk and very clumsy have been discovered in the bottom of the mineral trenches these seem to have been the same with the  fractaria  of the  Romans  pickaxes of enormous size used by the miners in the gold mines of  Spain  Buckets of singular construction and other things of uses unknown at present have been found among the antient mines  MY good friend that thorough honest mineagent Mr  Thomas Edwards  of  Saith Aclwyd  lately brought to me a  fractaria  Antient  wedges  a  eaden  and a wedge found in a shaft in our parish at the depth of sixty yards The wedge had at the thicker end a square perforation through which a stick was to be thrust which was held by a man whilst another with repeated strokes of a mallet drove the instrument into a crack it was to force open  I AM also indebted to Mr  Edwards  for a plate of lead of the shape of the sole of a shoe with an elevated rim round the sides and furnished also with a hooked handle to hang it in the fissures of the rocks of the mines evidently designed to have placed on it a lamp to give the miners light in their subterraneous operations This and another were found at the depth of sixty yards in a  Roman  mine  OUR mineral tract is from  Penyrallt  or  Bryndigri  MINERAL TRACT  in a line to the western borders of  Holywell  parish Its extent to north and south is very narrow The turnpike road by  Kelyn  and  Penyffordd Waen  as far as  Creecas  describes its course east and west This part goes under the name of the  Whiteford Rake  and is nearly the summit of the parish in this part The veins on the east side when they dip into the fields scarcely ever bear  THE veins run either north or south or east or west the last are generally found most profitable It is singular that the ore got in the first scarcely ever produces silver worth the refiner's labor  THE ores differ in quality  LEAD ORES  The lamellated or common kind usually named potter's ore yields from fourteen hundred to sixteen hundred and a quarter of lead from twenty hundred of the ore but the last produce is rare  THE quantity of silver produced from our lead is also variable The upper part of a vein of lead ore is always richest in silver the bottom in lead Our refiners will assay any lead that with yield ten ounces in the ton of lead and upwards The usual produce is fourteen ounces sixteen have been gotten but acquisitions of that kind within this circuit are extremely uncommon  CAR  CKFER  ON the side of the  Whiteford Rake  are the ruins of a large bu  ding called  Carrickfergus  probably from being sounded by some adventurer from that town for the purpose of smelting the ore got in its neighborhood It is near a century old and erected when the furnaces were constructed in a manner very different from those of the present times for by the remains of the chimnies they seem to have been formed like those of the modern ironfurnaces  THE depth of our leadmines are various Rich veins have been discovered to the depth of ninety yards  THE veins are found either in the limestone rock or that of chert These frequently go to unknown depths the ore is pursued extremely far indeed and when it ceases the unprofitable is usually found to consist of spar  GRAVEL LEADORE  GRAVEL ore or lumps from forty tons weight to the size of a hazelnut are often discovered in what the miners call  flats  or loose ground full of gravel tumblers and the like It is rounded and smoothed on the surface as if it had been rolled in violent waters but within is pure lamellated and rich It is a potter's ore reduced to this form by accident  THERE is no ascertaining the quantity of lead ore which is annually taken up in our parish nor yet that of lead exported It is included in the customhouse books at  Chester  in the general account of the produce of the mineral parts of this county and that of  Denbigh  The number of tons exported in is as follows  Foreign  Coastways  tons of lead    ore    ABOUT fifty years ago about seventeen hundred weight of copper ore was discovered in a tenement of my father's called  Catherine George's  which on being assayed was found to be very rich  COPPER ORE  but none has been discovered since notwithstanding the ground has been diligently searched  LAPIS CALAMINARIS or calamine  CALAMINE  is found in very great quantities almost the whole way I have mentioned but increases in plenty as we advance eastward It is found in veins like lead ore often by itself sometimes mixed with ore which renders the breaking and separating a work of labor and expence what is found in these parts is generally of the cavernous boney or cancellated kinds This mineral was the  Cadmia  of  Pliny  lib xxxiv c and the  Stonecadmia  of  Strabo  lib iii The  Romans  knew its uses in making of brass therefore cannot be supposed to have overlooked so necessary an ingredient The remains of the brassfounderies discovered in our kingdom shew that they were acquainted  with it The knowlege of this mineral in afterages was long lost Before the reign of  Elizabeth  much was imported from  Sweden  but at that period it was discovered again in the  Mendiphills  and fortunately at the same time that the working of the coppermines in those of  Cumberland  was renewed Our county abounds with it but till within these sixty years we were so ignorant of the value as to mend our roads with it which have of late years been turned up in a hundred places most successfully to recover the lost wealth It was  John Barrow  JOHN BARROW  a miner from the  Mendiphills  whom I well remember living in this parish who first made us acquainted with this valuable mineral having long worked in the calamine mines of his own country  IT appears that this mineral tract which is called the  Pantvein  has yielded ore from very early times In the last century there have been no very rich veins but then it is almost always yielding something and of later years has been particularly productive of calamine In the beginning of this century Sir  Thomas Grosvenour  had a good mine of lead ore on the side of the road My grandfather had another The benevolent charitable Mr  Edwards  of  Brinford  had another The Mr  Jones  of  Celyn  had another The last is said to have put a trapdoor to the top of the shaft and to have locked it and made use of the treasure below as a bank which he had recourse to according to his wants All these mines are on the same vein which is an east and west Sir  Thomas Grosvenour  's mine was included in the vast mineral grant possessed by his ancestor see  Tour in Wales  i p  All the other freeholders work on their respective freeholds Sir  Roger Mostyn  on his manor of  Mostyn  and on his freehold  A MR  Francis Leicester  of  Vauxhall  gives an account of this vein in a small pamphlet called 'The  little  Mine Adventure' published in He styles himself the present lessee and gives I believe a good plan of the vein in an annexed map  BLACK JACK  Zinc Pseudogalena  BLACK JACK  is met with in large quantities near the eastern extremity of the parish It is found to answer the purposes of calamine It has hitherto been only exported to  Bristol  and is sold there at the rate of  l    s per  ton delivered We have it in a metallic form of a blueish grey color and again of the colors of the dark semipellucid ambers  Cronsted  ii p  Magellan  's ed calls the first  Zincum ferro sulphurato mineralisatum  the other  Zincum calciforme cum ferro sulphuratum  THIS semimetal and its ore has been long known in  India  and imported from thence in a metallic state under the name of  tutenag  as early as the year It had even been fused in the  Goslar  mines as early as Yet the secret of its being an ingredient in making brass did not reach us till the year when it was communicated to us by Mr  Von Swob  I refer to the learned Bishop  Watson  's entertaining and instructive works for a full account of this useful mineral Let me here inform the reader from the same authority iv p that by the accident of the  Dutch  taking a  Portuguese  ship laden with calamine we learn the origin of the name it being derived from the  Arabic calaem  the same mineral as our  calamine  which is  plentifully found in the peninsula of  Malacca  and probably in other parts of  India  MILLDISTEMPER  A MOST excruciating and often fatal disorder frequently attacks the miners who work in the hard veins of lead ore or of black jack or of such as are solid and lodged between sides or immersed in the rock The disorder is called the  Felyn  from  Felyn  a mill It may be translated into  Milldistemper  because it was at first most frequent in the smeltingmills but for a considerable time past has ceased in those buildings and that happiness may be dated from the period in which lime has been used as a flux for the lead ores  IN the mines it arises from the workmen being obliged to use the pickaxe in the hard veins to get the ore out The minute particles fly about and are taken down into the stomach and into the lungs This occasions a most obstinate costiveness attended with most dreadful pains which have been known to last fourteen and even twentyone days and attended with a strong symptomatic fever  William Spencer  a miner worked in  Meilwr  a mine near  Holywell  in a close confined situation and where the ore was of a particular hard nature He was attacked annually during fifteen or sixteen years usually in the spring with an acute pain in the pit of his stomach extending itself downwards with a griping pain in the bowels and attended with a violent reaching vomiting costiveness and tenesmus His bowels and abdominal muscles were much contracted his pulse feeble and low he was subject to cold clammy sweats and an unusual coldness of his extremities In the efforts to vomit he sometimes  parted with a quantity of bile and in each evacuation I observed a deposition of a number of particles of lead by parting with which he found great relief The costiveness continued sometimes eight nine or ten days notwithstanding the repeated use of purgatives chiefly castoroil in large doses which I found to be the most effectual remedy When this was got the better of and a stool procured I observed in each evacuation a quantity of lead by which from the relief he obtained his pulse became better the contraction of his bowels disappeared and likewise the cold clammy sweats In three or four days and in the two last attacks he felt a similar acute pain in the lower part of his belly attended with a scantiness pain and difficulty in voiding his urine I consequently suspected that some leaden particles might have found their way into the bladder and gave him some diuretic medicines as balsam of  copaiba gumarabic  and oil of juniper In the course of twentyfour hours his urine was voided much easier and in greater quantity and he parted with as much pure lead by urine as would lie on a shilling He in the latter part of his days became asthmatic and weak and died  Nov  in the st year of his age  I AM obliged to Mr  William Denman  of  Holywell  surgeon for the above account of the sad disorder but more materially to his skill and my excellent constitution for a speedy recovery in the last spring  April  th P M from the consequences of a kneepan snapped in two transversely by no other violence than by stepping down two steps instead of one After a strict recumbency of near seven weeks in possession  of high spirits fulness of faculties and enjoyment of my favorite amusements I rose from my bed with the grateful prospect of p  ng the remainder of my days with my prior activity little impaired thankful to PROVIDENCE for graciously adding this blessing to the numbers of others it has showered on me during my long and various life  CHERT  CHERT which I have mentioned before as being often the lodgement of the mineral veins is the  petrosilex  and  lapis corneus  of  Cronstedt  i It is of a flinty nature and the only one of that class we have in our county Nodular flints the attendant on chalks are quite unknown here This is in the neighborhood of limestone as flints are concomitant with chalk It is an opaque stone sometimes plain often varied with stripes I have spoken of it as a matrix of the ores I now consider it as useful in manufactures It is frequently cut out of its quarries in great masses and sent to the pottery countries of  Staffordshire  first for the purposes of forming stones to grind and comminute the calcined flints which are the great ingredients in the stone ware and I think it is itself calcined and being homogeneous with the purer flints serves also for the same purposes Much of it is found in the midst of our hills sinking as I have said to depths unknown In Sir  Roger Mostyn  's land near  Penyrallt  where the upper part of the parish hangs abrupt over the lower it forms the broken precipitous front and has been of late quarried out for exportation Bishop  Watson  ii says that it sells in  Derbyshire  at eight shillings ton The duke of  Rutland  contents himself with five shillings  per  ton as lord of the rock The workmen have three shillings for raising I leave the reader to consult the right reverend author  for the process of calcining c The knowlege may be of use to my countrymen whether it is any way related to the  Petunse  of the  Chinese  p It may not be wrong to consult our late legatine voyagers to  China  for that purpose  OUR limestone is a genuine marble often pure  LIMESTONE  often filled with  entrochi  and shells composed entirely of homogeneous matter I have mentioned the immensity of the beds but it is often found mixed with calamine and ore Its uses cannot be unknown to any whether in building whether for the purposes of agriculture I am sensible its application is not extended as far as it ought to be but more of that under the article  Rural Oeconomy  Here I may say that it is the common flux used by the smelters in the fusing the lead ores which has taken off much of the noxious effect it formerly had on the smelters who were engaged in the operation and on the cattle who fed on the grass within reach of the smoke  ON the west side of  Celyn  rake is a large stratum of a deep grey limestone which when calcined makes mixed with common lime an excellent cement or terras for works constructed in water It is nearly equal to the  Aberdour  stone from  South Wales  of which much has been imported for the uses of our great buildings on the  Holywell  stream  OF spars we have in abundance the white opaque kind  SPARS  but I think none of the fine refracting spars or the  Crystallum Islandicum  which is frequent in the neighboring parishes  PETROLEUM rockoil  PETROLEUM  or what the  Welsh  call it  y menin tylwith têg  or fairies butter has been found in the limestone strata  in our mineral country It is a greasy substance of an agreeable smell and I suppose ascribed to the benign part of those imaginary beings It is esteemed serviceable in rheumatic cases rubbed on the parts affected It retains a place in our Dispensary  ADVENTI  OUS    I SHALL just mention two or three adventitious bodies discovered at vast depths in our mines We have been often surprised with finding great rude logs of timber at the depth of twentyfive or fortyfive yards under ground They are quite rough and totally freed from any suspicion of having been used in the mines even had they not been met with in new or unworked ground in blue clay and amidst tumblers They are firm and strong when first taken up and of a black color as if they had been burnt  SHELLS  SHELLS especially  conchae anomiae  are very common sometimes loose but more frequently immersed in the limestone  CHANGE OF STRATA  I NOW quit the heights and go down a steep descent about half a mile into the lower part of the parish The mouth of a level and a shallow shaft near it discovers the change of strata The chert and the limestone quite disappear and in their place appear first the beds of shale  SHALE  black shattery and soon dissoluble when exposed to the weather It is the symptom of approaching coal and the covering  Cronstedt  i calls it a pyritaceous  schistus  and gives it other epithets according to its contents It is often found in beds of immense thickness and often filled with inflammable air which frequently bursts out to the great inconveniency and danger of the workmen It is also impregnated with bitumen which adds to its powers In many parts of the kingdom it is found to contain quantities of alum  ALUM  and to be worked for the purpose of extracting from it that useful article The trial is worth making In our parts we have the same advantages of coal for the process and watercarriage for the exportation as  Whitby  has Coals begin to appear in their unprofitable beds at a small distance to the east half a mile further in great bodies and of an excellent quality  THE collieries of  Mostyn  and  Bychton  have been worked for a very considerable space  COLLIERIES  and in the last century supplied  Dublin  and the eastern side of  Ireland  with coals They were discovered in the township of  Mostyn  as early as the time of  Edward  I as appears by an extent of that place in the twentythird year of that reign  I REMEMBER many fluctuations in their state They are now in the most flourishing which I ever remember inferior only to that in which they were in the latter end of the late and the beginning of the present century The rise of the collieries at  Whitehaven  which interfered with our trade to  Dublin  was one cause of their decline but another great cause was a natural one the loss of the channel of the river  Dee  We still load a few small vessels for the neighboring coasts of  North Wales  But our present prosperity arises from the great works of copperplates bolts and sheathings for ships and the works of brass established of late years near the town of  Holywell  To them may be added the consumption occasioned by the increase of population by the accession of the cotton manufactures and finally th  vast quantities used for burning of lime the effect of the happy inprovement in agriculture annually increasing for numbers of years I do not mention our obligations to the numerous smeltinghouses for lead as they have been established among us during time immemorial  QUAY  I REMEMBER a quay beneath the  Mostyn  collieries built by the grandfather of the present Sir  Roger Mostyn  at which small vessels used to take in their lading  ENGINE  And I also remember on the shore the walls which supported the wheels and other machinery of a waterengine for draining the colliery Of this I have a drawing by Mr  Dinely  whom at p I have related to have visited  Mostyn  in the year  THIS engine seems to have been formed on the model of some of those used in the  German  mines in the time of  George Agricola  See the representation of several from p to p in his Treatise  de

corresponding with some of the  Flintshire  They remain as yet lost on the northern part of the same hundred but are found a third time in vast quantities in  Lancashire  on the opposite side of the  Mersey  Their extent from west to east in this country may be reckoned from the parish of  Llanasa  through those of  Whiteford Holywell Flint Northop  and  Hawarden  Our coal is of different qualities suited to the variety of demands of the several sorts of founderies in the neighborhood Sometimes is also found the peacockcoal of Dr  Plot  remarkable for the beauty of its surface glossed over with the changeable brilliancy of the colors of that beautiful bird  CAN  L C  L  THE beds of canal are inferior indeed in elegance to those of  Lancashire  but greatly coveted by the limeburners  COALS were known to the  Britons  before the arrival of the  Romans  who had not even a name for them yet  Theophrastus  describes them very accurately at lest three centuries before the time of  Caesar  and even says that they were used by workers in brass It is highly probable that the  Britons  made use of them It is certain they had a primitive name for this fossil that of  Glo  and as a farther proof I may add that a flintax the instrument of the  aborigines  of our island was discovered stuck in certain veins of coal exposed to day in  Craig y Parc  in  Monmouthshire  and in such a situation as to render it very accessible to the unexperienced natives who in early times were incapable of pursuing the veins to any great depths The artless smelters of antient times made use of wood only in their operations as we find among the reliques of their hearths  FREESTONE  AT a short distance from the shale appear the beds of freestone first on the side of the dingle  Nant y bi  and from thence above the coal terminating in the cliffs in the parts of  Tre Bychton  and  Tre Mostyn  which are washed by the sea  BURNT ROCK  IN the township of  Tre Mostyn  near the shore is a cliff of a very singular appearance looking like the semivitrified lava of a volcano The stratum is in front universally changed in its disposition and run into a horrible mass of red and black often porous in all parts very hard In it is a hollow a vein in which was lodged the pyritical matter that took fire which continued burning by its own  phlogiston  see Bishop  Watson  i to p and caused the phenomenon Its fury chiefly raged  towards the front and diminished gradually in the internal part of the bed which at some distance within land appears only discolored The stratum is a sandstone of the common sort  Da Costa's Fossils  I am informed that these appearances are not uncommon in  Derbyshire  and that Mr  Ferber  an ingenious  Swede  and Mr  Whiteburst  our ingenious countryman have taken notice of them in their writings  I SHALL here introduce the mention of damps found in collieries which are not unfrequent  A FIREDAMP  and sometimes act with amazing fury and fatal consequences There are two species the suffocating and the fire The last is very rare in the leadmines unless in those parts where the  shale  or stone attendant on coal begins The first kills instantaneously by its mephitic vapor and is a disaster common to neglected vaults and drawwells The other is inflammable and burns and destroys in a dreadful manner as the colliers through negligence in not setting fire to the vapor before it gets to a head do often experience The most tremendous instance was on  February  d in a coalwork at  Mostyn  which I shall relate from the  Philosophical Transactions  and so conclude the account of our mineral concerns  THE damp had been perceived for some time before resembling fiery blades darting and crossing each other from both sides of the pit The usual methods were taken to free the pit from this evil After a cessation of work for three days the steward thinking to fetch a compass about from the eye of the pit that came from the day and to bring wind by a secure way along with him that if it burst again it may be done without danger of men's lives went down and took two men  along with him which served his turn for this purpose He was no sooner down but the rest of the workmen that had wrought there disdaining to be left behind in such a time of danger hasted down after them and one of them more indiscreet than the rest went headlong with his candle over the eye of the damp pit at which the damp immediately catched and flew up to and fro over all the hollows of the work with a great wind and a continual fire and as it went keeping a mighty great roaring noise on all sides  THE men at first appearance of it had most of them fallen upon their faces and hid themselves as well as they could in the loose slack or small coal and under the shelter of posts yet nevertheless the damp returning out of the hollows and drawing towards the eye of the pit it came up with incredible force the wind and fire tore most of their clothes off their backs and singed what was left burning their faces and hands the blasts falling so sharp on their skin as if they had been whipt with cords Some that had less shelter were carried fifteen or sixteen yards from their first station and beaten against the roof of the coal and sides of the posts and lay afterwards a good while senseless so that it was long before they could hear or find one another As it drew up to the daypit it caught one of the men along with it that was next to the eye and up it comes with such a terrible crack not unlike but more shrill than a cannon that was heard fifteen miles off with the wind and such a pillar of smoke as darkened all the sky overhead for a good while The brow of the hill above the pit was eighteen yards high and on it grew trees of fourteen or fifteen  yards long yet the man's body and other things from the pit were seen above the tops of the highest trees at lest yards On this pit stood a horseengine of substantial timber and strong ironwork on which lay a trunk or barrel for winding the rope up and down of above pounds weight it was then in motion one bucket going down and the other coming up full of water This trunk was fastened to that frame with locks and bolts of iron yet it was thrown up and carried a good way from the pit and pieces of it though bound with iron hoops and strong nails blown into the woods about so likewise were the two buckets and the ends of the rope after the buckets were blown from them stood awhile upright in the air like pikes and then came leisurely drilling down The whole frame of the engine was stirred and moved out of its place and those men's clothes caps and hats that escaped were afterwards found shattered to pieces and thrown amongst the woods a great way from the pit  ANOTHER of these damps happened in the same lands within my memory In the year  ANOTHER IN  one man was beat to pieces in the bottom of the pit Two others were taken up alive but died soon after and two others survived but were most dreadfully burnt and one who is now living remains a dreadful evidence of the effects of the damp All his fingers burnt off and his visage terribly disfigured  I SHALL here describe agitations of the earth derived from other causes which  EARTHQUAKES  dreadful as they have been in distant countries have here occasioned little more than a momentary alarm I have at this house felt four shocks of the earthquake I shall  relate their effects from the  Philosophical Transactions  in which they are recorded On  April  d between the hours of ten and eleven at night I was greatly alarmed with a violent shock of an earthquake I who was in bed was frequently moved up and down and the bed having castors was removed some small space from its proper situation  DURING the shock a great noise was heard in the air and some nights before lights were seen in the sky such as were previous to the earthquake in town  I HAVE summed up the remainder in a letter to Sir  Joseph Banks  baronet K B which had the honor of being read before the ROYAL SOCIETY on  January  th following and afterwards printed in the  Transactions  vol lxxi p  Downing  Dec    Dear Sir  It is very singular that in three days after my return home I should be reminded of my promise by a repetition of the very phenomenon on which I had engaged to write to you for on  Saturday  last between four and five in the evening we were alarmed with two shocks of an earthquake a slight one immediately followed by another very violent It seemed to come from the northeast and was preceded by the usual noise At present I cannot trace it farther than  Holywell  THE earthquake preceding this was on the th of  August  about a quarter before nine in the morning I was forewarned of it by a rumbling noise not unlike the coming of a great waggon into my courtyard Two shocks immediately followed which were strong enough to terrify us They came  from the northwest were felt in  Anglesea  at  Caernarvon Llanrwst  in the vale of  Clwyd  south of  Denbigh  at this house and in  Holywell  but I could not discover that their force extended any farther  THE next in this retrograde way of enumerating these phenomena was on the th  September  about a quarter before ten at night The noise was such as preceded the former and the shock so violent as to shake the bottles and glasses on the table round which myself and some company were sitting This seemed to come from the east I see in the  Gentleman's Magazine  of that year that this shock extended to  Shropshire  and quite to  Bath  and to  Swansea  in  South Wales  THE earliest earthquake I remember here was on the th of  April  It has the honor of being recorded in the  Philosophical Transactions  therefore I shall not trouble you with the repetition of what I have said  PERMIT me to observe that I live near a mineral country in a situation between leadmines and coalmines in a sort of neutral tract about a mile distant from the first and half a mile from the last On the strictest inquiry I cannot discover that the miners or colliers were ever sensible of the shocks under ground nor have they ever perceived when the shocks in question have happened any falls of the loose and shattery strata in which the last especially work yet at the same time the earthquakes have had violence sufficient to terrify the inhabitants of the surface  TO this observation I may add that no eruptions of water were ever observed to follow the shocks no water from the vast  reservoirs of that element formed in the deserted pits which have often burst through the hollow which contained them and more than once drowned the unhappy colliers who have been working beneath  I HAVE seen in prints an observation of some gentleman learned in earthquakes that the cause of those I have mentioned which leave the shattery strata of the coalmines unaffected to have been electricity which in these instances moved equally and gently so as not to cause any concussion or to go perhaps far below the surface so that they leave the worked depths totally untouched  NONE of these earthquakes were local for excepting the first all may be traced to very remote parts The weather was remarkable still at the time of every earthquake I have felt  I remain with true regard c  T P  QUADRUPEDS  THE quadrupeds of this parish are common to many parts of  England  Yet I shall give a catalogue of them in our antient tongue and affix to them those in the  English  IN respect to the  March Ceffyl  the horse the  caseg  or mare

It is greatly dreaded by our fishermen on account of the dangerous spine issuing from the tail with which it might give a mortal wound From the  British Zoology  I shall add that the terror of its weapon supplied the antients with many tremendous fables relating to it  Pliny A  ian  and  Oppian  have given it a venom that affects even the inanimate creation Trees that are struck by it instantly lose their verdure and perish and rocks themselves are incapable of resisting the potent poison  THE enchantress  Circe  armed her son with a spear headed with the spine of the  trygon  a species of stingray as the most irresistible weapon she could furnish him with and with which he afterwards committed parricide unintentionally on his father  Ulysses  But we need not dive into antiquity for the fatal application of the spine of some of the ray genus The inhabitants of certain parts of  South America  and of some of the newdiscovered islands in the  Pacific Ocean  still head their spears with

slope that falls rapidly to the sea It abounds with little springs which accumulating in their course form streams of power sufficient to turn some cornmills of considerable size  FFYNNON OSWALD  THE largest independent rivulet is that which gushes from  Ffynnon Oswald  or the well of  Oswald  in the township of  Merton Ychlan  It takes its name from the  Saxon  monarch martyr and faint  Oswald  king of the  Northumbrians  who was defeated and slain on  October  th near  Oswestry  by the pagan  Penda  king of the  Mer  ians  who hung his limbs on stakes dispersed over the field as trophies of his victory Some of the tradition reached our parish for there is near to the well a certain field called  A  lod Oswald  or  Oswald's limb  as if one of them had found its way to this place For a farther account of the legend I refer to article  Oswestry  vol i p edit of my  Tour in Waies  This stream divides the parish of  Whiteford  for a certain way from that of  Holywell  BRYNYGROES  POSSIBLY  St Oswald  had near his well a cross for not remote on an eminence named  BrynyGroes  or  the Hill of the Cross  stood one of those marks of piety of which still remains the shaft  WHITEFORD STREAM  THE stream of most utility rises from a spring a little beyond the village of  Whiteford  It runs by my house and is no small ornament to my ground It turns my two mills which with much patriotism and little wisdom I erected The first is near the  Gwibnant  or  Wibnant  and made in form of a chapel My great folly is about half a mile lower is an excellent mill and does much business for the lessee This stream is much augmented by another which rises at a place called  Saith Ffynnan  or  the Seven Wells  and murmurs through the romantic  Nantybi  and unites with it at the  Wibnant  It concludes its course near  Llanerchymôr  smeltinghouse to which it is of great use by setting in  motion some stampers for comminuting the slags before they are committed to the hearth for the extraction of the remaining lead  THE last stream runs through  Felyn Blwm  or  the leadmill  FELYN BLWM  a great romantic dingle which divides this parish from that of  LlanAsaph  Near its fall into the sea is a considerable mill the property of Sir  Roger Mostyn  This dingle probably takes its name from the number of antient smeltinghearths for lead found in it in use in the primaeval artless times of smelting  ALL our dingles run parallel to each other  NATURE OF THE DINGLES  and begin at some distance from the first or steepest descent from the mountain The sides of all are cloathed with oaks and each has its rill at the bottom These great ravines I may call them were evidently formed on the running down of the waters of the deluge on its subsidence when they found their way to what the ALMIGHTY determined should ever remain a circumambient sea  NUMBERS of the small springs which arise in the lower part of the parish shew symptoms of the internal contents  CHALYBEATE SPRINGS  In the neighborhood of the coal they are covered with a dirty yellow ochreous scum and are more or less chalybeate One which rises before my house is strongly so and proved very beneficial to the only person I know who made a fair use of it  IN respect to the husbandry of this parish  HUSBANDRY  it may be divided into several parts I shall first pay attention to the higher or the mountanous That tract is very extensive  MOUNTAIN GROUND  covered in general with heath mixed with coarse grass The climate very cold in comparison of the lower parts We often find during  winter a severe frost reign there when the ground has been quite soft and the air mild in the lower parts  THE soil in general a poor loam and in many parts very thin in others the limestone pervades the stratum and forms large tracts of rock There are certain parts fit for agriculture as has been found by the surreptitious inclosures made in a few parts which yield corn such as barley and oats in a kindly manner I wish experiments were made of planting part which if put under the care of a woodman might be a national benefit as well as a private one to the lord of the manor The neglect of appointing woodmen would render the planting of no effect by reason of the variety of trespasses as we freeholders of the lower parts who make our woods the glory of our estates do daily and cruelly experience  OUR mountains support some blackcattle the greater part of which are left out the whole year to take their chance Still the high country is a nursery Many are sent lean to market and drove to more genial soils Most of our farmers fatten cattle and either sell them to the butchers for the  Holywell  market or to those of  Chester  and  Leverpool  SHEEP  THE sheep are numerous They likewise are left to themselves and become in hard weather great nusances by their trespasses on the cultivated lands of us lowlanders As may be imagined they produce little wool Their fleeces are coarse yet of that a small quantity is sold into  Merionethshire  and the rest manufactured at home and made either into cloth for the country people or into flannel for the women or knit into stockings all for home consumption In respect to mutton much  is brought to market from the mountains but that is only during the vigorous part of the summer and after the frost or rainy season but the greatest part of the sheep bought by the gentry for the table is purchased at the distant country fairs  NUMBERS of hogs are bred in our parish  HOGS  and numbers are sold at the fairs and driven to distant parts  THE soil of the lower part of the parish is in general a very stiff clay which continues quite to the edge of the cliff  SOILS  CLAY  above the shore In many places are spots of gravel but of very small extent We have also beds of pure sand but that useful article is in most parts scarce  FROM the  Rhewl  to  Avon Marsh Siambr  is a thin vein of very rich marle saponaceous to the touch prettily veined with red grey and white It is got in too small quantities for use On the edge of the mountain especially on the tenement of  Plâs Captain  is a larger vein of a coarser kind The tenant  Thomas Blore  a  Cheshire  man conversant in this species of manure has made a judicious application of it on his farm and as long as it lasted reaped the reward of his industry  BEYOND the space between the boundary and the mountain is a tract of light soil which may be said to begin under  Kelyn  LICHTER SOIL  in the township of  Uchlan  and continue in a direct line by  Tyddin Ycha  to  Plas Ycha  in the township of  Mostyn  This is extremely well adapted for that useful root the turnep and it has been tried with success But the farmer is obliged to give up the cultivation by reason of the depredations the poor make on the crops They will steal the turneps before his face laugh at him when he fumes at them and ask him how he can be in such a rage about a few turneps As a magistrate I never had a complaint made before  me against a turnepstealer Our farmers and our coaladventurers have not yet 'plucked the old woman out of their hearts' for the last suffer likewise in a great degree in their trade yet hardly complain Incredible as it may appear numbers of them are in fear of being cursed at St  Aelian  's well see my  Tour in Wales  vol ii p and suffer the due penalty of their superstition  AT uncertain seasons clouds of ringdoves woodpigeons or queests wintermigrants from  Scandinavia  have visited our turnepfields and done no small damage to the crops  POTATOES  EVERY cottage has its garden and if that is not large enough any landlord or neighbor allots him a piece in one of his fields for the purpose of a potatoegarden and this spot is prepared and manured by the landlord and for which not more than  d  per rood is demanded The last comfort is not of long date for I can remember the time in which it was almost unknown to the poorer people neither did the rich extend the culture beyond the garden How singular does appear to us the following quotation from old  Gerard  p who speaks of it as  being also a meate for pleasure equall in goodnesse and wholesomenesse vnto the same being either rosted in the embers or boyled and eaten with oyle vinegar and pepper or dressed any other way by the hand of some cunning in cookerie  At present our gardeners and a few others of the parish raise sufficient to supply their neighbors and to carry for sale to the adjacent market The stiff soil of the parish is unfavorable to the culture If we want potatoes in any quantities we must import them from the vaie of  Conwy  from  Cheshire  and  Lancashire  In the present time of scarcity  May  the cultivation  has been unusually encreased in  Whiteford  parish Before this season I never raised more than was necessary for the use of my family this year I increased my potatoeground manyfold even before I had read the speech made by Sir  John Sinclair  Thousands have done the same in a similar state of ignorance some from benevolence some from view of gain and others on the principle of selfpreservation I may predict also from the former motives that wheat will be in the next season sown fourfold Admonitions surely are unnecessary In the next year we may rejoice in plenty even in superfluity and have the happiness of seeing the poor man exult in our successBut the  halcyon  days are arriving fast Let us comfort ourselves with the fair prospect before us and devoutly pray for the accomplishment of those hopes delivered to us in the following prophetic effusions  Let us cut off those legal bars  Which crush the culture of our fertile isle  Were they remov'd unbounded wealth would flow  Our wastes would then with varied produce smile  And  England  soon a second  Eden  prove  WHEAT grows remarkably well in our clayey land  WHEAT  it is the red kind that the farmer prefers for seed it is the hardiest and the surest of finding sale the white and the grey being in our country less in request We raise much more than the parish would consume The rest is exported to  Leverpool  to supply the county of  Lancashire  with bread that vast county not being productive of much wheat The demand therefore from the numerous populous towns is very considerable and at times occasions a great rise in the price and a consequential clamor at home The complaints are the draining of our county of grain and the imaginary evil of great farms Grain is one of the articles of commerce of the parish and weaving the support of  thousands and thousands of poor in the great county I have mentioned We feed them they supply us with various species of cloathing As to food let me add that the farmers of that county even make us a return in that article for they supply us with potatoes as we do them with wheat We all depend upon one another so true is it that  GOD never form'd an independant man  Without such means of sale or we may call it exchange of commodities the great farmer would cease to plough would cease to form those magazines of corn on which at all times our markers depend and which are the great preservative from famine in these kingdoms At times bad seasons occasion bad crops and of course enhance the price An inordinate lust of gain may sometimes occasion criminal confederacies which criminal as they are have hitherto baffled every attempt of the legislature to prevent The poor are now left quite defenceless against the iniquitous race of  forestallers  c c by the repeal of the th and th  Edw  VI It is much to be lamented that those humane laws are not revived modified in any manner adapted to the times A middle man in great contracts is often requisite it is not that description of men at whom I aim but those who in small bargains tempt the farmer by offers of exorbitant prices and contribute to the distresses of the poor and discontents of the country to a degree unspeakable At present a calamitous war assists that evil but surely we cannot grudge food to our brave countrymen who are fighting for all that is dear to us Among them we may have neighbors sons of tenants our own sons or different relations to whom if we think a moment we should be ashamed to deny a share in the produce of the labor of their native country in which it is possible they themselves might have bore a share  SUPPOSING all farms are reduced to an equality and all made small ones the ground must be divided into little portions for the support of a miserable team or of a few cows or for raising small quantities of corn No magazines could be formed against evil days the produce of the dairy would be small and the provision for fodder serve for little more than to support the live stock A few hobbets  A hobbet consists of quarts A measure is half a hobbet A peck is half a measure These measures are used in all the  Flintshire  markets they extend also to other  Welsh  counties and even  Herefordshire  of corn would be sent to market to pay the rent the rest might serve to maintain the family till the return of the harvest and if the stock should be consumed before that season how would they wish for the restoring of the great farms Many of the little farmers are also daylaborers to whom could they apply for work the very support of them and their families NEVER HAS THERE BEEN A FAMINE IN ENGLAND SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF GREAT FARMS Unavoidable scarcities will happen from causes inevitable But there has not been an instance for numbers of centuries of the poor running into corners to die for want of food of their seeing their infants perish before their eyes and perhaps a plague might ensue the consequence of famine to thin the land of multitudes of the miserable survivors  I SPEAK disinterestedly for I have not on my estate a single great farmer I find no merit in this assertion had it been otherwise I should have supported him in all that was right in common with my poorest tenant and my poorest tenant perhaps in preference to him  I WOULD never grant a lease to a great corntenant I would preserve a power over his granary which legislature will not or cannot assume Should he attempt by exportation to exhaust it in years of scarcity and not leave a sufficient supply for the country which produced the grain should he attempt a monopoly should he refuse to carry a proper quantity to the next market or should he refuse to sell to the poor who cannot attend the market corn in small quantities I would instantly assume the power of the landlord and expel him from my estate a just punishment for the tenant who through rapacity declines to comply with my desires excited with no other view than to promote the good of the public  THE necessity of great farms is admitted but let it be remembered that their support rests upon the laborers who are equally requisite to the great farmer as beams are to a building Let not the rapacity of the miscalled great man direct all his force to the support of the opulent farmer for the sake of increased rent He will as sad examples prove depopulate his country by removing the sturdy laborers to the ground of wiser landlords and leave his own weakened by their desertion while the fields of the former laugh and sing but round his own  ingens  it solitudo  I COULD wish was it in my power to add even to the cottages of my laborers two or three small fields that they might have the comfort of a cow to supply their families with milk They are too useful a class of men to be neglected to be left to the precarious possibility of getting any of that invigorating fluid so necessary for their infants and even for the support of their  own strength to sustain them through their labor Give them a dry  stated  cottage with an upper floor and a kind landlord and a  British  laborer need not envy  Caesar  BEFORE I take leave of the subject let me define the size of a great and a small farm in this parish Our greatest farm is rented at £  per ann  at the rate of about  s per  acre Our small farms have from to acres and the rent  per  acre from  s  to  s  There may be in every parish instances of the exorbitant raise of rent an evil most frequently originating in the luxury of the landlord Our rents are moderate because our gentry would blush to add one dish to their table at the expence of the tenant Mr  Wedge  in his  Survey of Cheshire  p speaks humanely and sensibly on the affected maxim of  high rents being a spur to industry  This for I must help Mr  Wedge  with a simile resembles the practice of the prudent planter who wishes to quicken the industry of his negroes by the invigorating application of the cartwhip to their velvet skin  IN respect to leases the utility is not perfectly agreed on In our parts of  North Wales  I have known leasetenants of very moderate rent continue on their farms their whole term without success and I know in this parish and within a small distance several rackrent tenants with large farms the most prosperous of any in the country They improve boldly and reap amply the fruits of their industry They have confidence in their landlords nor can they recollect more than one instance and that indeed disgraceful enough  Survey of North Wales  article  Denbighshire  p  in which they found it misplaced They are masters  of the knowlege of the soil and the nature of the climate of their own country The appearance of their tenements does them credit When they heard of a person sent among them to inculcate the principles of good farming they smiled at the design but spoke with gratitude of the kind intent of the  Board of Agriculture Denbighshire  has long had its little board for  North Wales  does not neglect its own interests An agricultural society has for a number of years been estabished in the vale of  Clwyd  None who have visited that beautiful tract can deny the general excellency of its culture  IN  Cheshire  the antient practice of leasing is growing fast out of use and agriculture will increase in that county in proportion  MR  George Kay  of  Leith  the missionary to whom was committed the inspection of every farm in the six counties of  North Wales  favored me with a call some time in the last summer and delivered to me his credentials from Sir  John Sinclair  I was really at the time out of spirits At the same time a report was circulated that the object of the mission was to ascertain the reality of our landtax which was much credited by my countrymen I was certain that the report was entirely unfounded but I did not chuse to trouble myself with militating against what I knew must speedily become selfconfuted I treated Mr  Kay  with all civility He left me and I believe through all his journey one place excepted had no reason to complain of the reception he met with Sir  John Sinclair  is a man of honor He had not the lest occasion to give himself the trouble of making to me so earnest an asseveration of the purity of his intentions as he did in his last favor He is above taking clandestine means of getting at any kind of information  WE lament that Mr  Kay  did not see in any one of our six counties a single custom that could be useful to others  Hints for Improvements in North Wales  p  From the state of numbers of our farms I suspect that we had previously adopted many methods of agriculture from  English  counties which must have occasioned his remark I would fain pay that compliment to his candour On the whole I fear that the mission has passed most unprofitably to both  visitor  and  visitè  Nothing seems to have been learned by the one and nothing taught by the other  WE thatch our hayricks with admirable neatness and in that manner preserve the hay for years I do not know a better expedient even could the landlord afford to every little farm a haybarn or give them a moveable canopy which is liable perpetually to be out of order Necessity in every country causes different modes of oeconomy Send  Shenkin ap Morgan  on a survey of  Cathness  and he would at first stare at the  bykes  Tour in Scotland  d ed p  but would admire the ingenuity of the contrivances and acknowlege the wisdom of the farmer in the preservation of his grain where other means were wanting  THERE are certainly both beyond the  Tweed  and beyond the  Dee  many thousands of acres of which a tenant should be courted to attempt the cultivation and be bribed by leases to settle upon them In  North Britain  the practice is common In  North Wales  our mountain landlords rarely grant leases possibly from their not finding the necessity  IN all the mineral part of  Flintshire  are numbers of small farms tenanted by carriers who entirely support themselves by the  carriage of the lead ore and calamine or coal These are reckoned the most slovenly farmers we have They apply themselves to carriage to such a degree as to neglect their tenements The minerals are the great natural staple of this and most of the parishes so that these species of farms are quite indispensable  LET not the little farmer or the cottager repine at the wealth of the great farmers It is not many weeks since their empty stomachs have been filled from the hoards of the latter Had they not been able to form a stock or to enable by sale others to do so what would have become of you The good the benevolent have been able to purchase from them the food that has contributed to preserve for many months you and your's from cruel want The instances of the recent charities have not been equalled I may speak of the universal charities But I will recal to your minds those of your several neighborhoods In public calamities little souls lie squat in their holes great souls arise and are called forth to action some from a generous sensibility others from selfish motives I cannot but confess myself to be among the latter I am selfish enough to wish to put out my money at lest on reversionary interest but that on security incontestible  HE THAT HATH PITY ON THE POOR LENDETH TO THE LORD AND LOOK WHAT HE LAYETH OUT IT SHALL BE PAID TO HIM AGAIN  With what animated benevolence of sentiment doth Sir  Thomas Broune  comment on this pious exhortation 'There is' says the great physician of  Norwich  more rhetoric in that one sentence than in a library of sermons and indeed if those sentences were understood by the reader with the same emphasis as they were delivered by the Author we needed not those volumes of instructions but might be honest by epitome  THE produce of the wheat of this parish is from seven and eight fold to twelve or thirteen  PRODUCE OF WHEAT  according to the pains taken with the ground or the nature of it Our general manure is lime burnt in sodkilns The limestone broken small  SODKILNS  is placed within a thick circular wall of sods and the strata of stone broken small interlaid with beds of coal which is set on fire by wood placed in certain holes left at the sides These holes serve likewise to admit the air which promotes the fierceness of the fire within The limestones are piled in a conic form to a great height above the top of the sodwall and then covered thickly with sods I must mention that the holes are four in number placed opposite to each other and have a gutter cut from one to the other which is left hollow by means of flat stones over them to promote the current of air A circular gutter also runs close to the interior side of the sod wall A commonsized kiln will require about sixteen tons of stone but there are larger and those often of an oval form  SOMETIMES the limestone is burnt in common kilns then taken and carried to form a compost with earth which had been deposited in some adjacent place and which usually had been dug out of old ditches The lime is intimately mixed with it and left a considerable time to mature after which it is applied to use  OUR best barley is raised in the light soil which we have mentioned at p  BARLEY  In general our farmers prepare the ground for barley by giving it a fallow in  December  or  January  and again harrow and plough it the latter end of  April  or beginning of  May  In the stiffer lands the crops are frequently very unfavorable  The quantity raised is not equal to the consumption It is the principal grain used by our common people The produce from the hobbet is about equal to that of the wheat  OATS  OATS are chiefly sown in the mountain inclosures or on the lands adjacent to the mountains The produce is by no means equal to our demand  GRASSES  THE artificial grasses are but two Clover the red sort which we sow immediately after the barley  CLOVER  When the clover is sowen by itself or without any other grassseeds the quantity to each acre is eighteen or twenty pounds It is not a favorite grass but we do not know how to remedy ourselves It wears out in less than three years after which we renew the ground with a crop of wheat managed as before related The cloverseed is procured from the vale of  Clwyd  and other places where the plant is cultivated for the sake of the seed  RYEGRASS  RYEGRASS is sowen in our poor land which if not harvested early is little better than a fodder of straw  I VALUE myself on being the first in this parish who introduced on my estate the husbandry of draining and flooding which I did last autumn and throughout the winter on a great number of acres I did intend to desist from working after  Christmas  had I not been induced to continue it throughout the season in consideration of the numbers of poor people who were in the deepest distress for want o  employ The season was so rigorous that the laborers were obliged to break into the unfrozen ground with the pickax before they could use the spade This and the short days made the work very expensive but I was far  overpaid by the consideration of having given food to multitudes who in themselves or their families must otherwise have labored under the greatest difficulties The undertaker was Mr  Henry Harrison  who followed the most approved practice I flatter myself that in the ensuing year I shall experience the effects of his skill  To clear the freeholders of  Whiteford  parish from any inattention to that important article of husbandry planting  PLANTING  I bring the brief but irresistible defence ofthe impossibility The dingles are filled with oaks I believe there is not one of us have any waste ground for the purpose All our tenements consist of arable or pasture land too valuable to be spared for any other purpose in this populous parish Sir  Roger Mostyn  on his coming to his estate planted the little that had been cleared by his predecessor Besides  Mostyn  or  Whiteford  wood see p many of our very hedges are filled with oaks possibly they do not benefit our land by their shade but a few of us are true  druids  and should we apply the ax we should imagine that we heard the groans of the  Hamadryads  at every stroke  I AM in particular so very avaricious of my woods that at this instant of writing I with true reluctance sign to my son the deathwarrant of a few staghorned trees that have far outlived the best of their days They in all probability would have had a respite could I move from my couch to take a look at my antient favorites But the void space shall be instantly inclosed and I may promise that in a short time it will be filled with the best of successors selfsown from some of their own descendants their eldest and most sturdy progeny  SIR EDWARD LLOYD A GREAT PLANTER  IF we of  Whiteford  parish are deprived of the possibility of planting within its limits yet we can boast of a  Flintshire  gentleman who probably will be found to have contributed as a planter more to the benefit of his heir and of the state than any other in the principality in this age or any past I mean Sir  Edward Lloyd  bart of  Pengwern  in the parish of  St Asaph  who finished his long and useful life on  May  the th of the present year On his  Flintshire  estates he has planted a hundred and sixtytwo thousand trees and on his estate at  Pantglâs  in the county of  Caernarvon  more than three hundred and twenty thousand Most of the trees are oaks which in future times may float on the ocean guardians of  Britain  in distant wars excited either by the ambition of foreign states or by the incendiary machinations of domestic malecontentsEven at present what have we to dread The maritime genius of our island at length begins to smile on her again and vigor and activity once more will fill every sail The great spirit of old  Sandwich  has transmigrated leaving behind the frailties of its mortal state purified and congenialized to the breast it has taken possession of on its return to the wonted Board to resume its wellknown powers  Haud segnis strato surgit  Palim  rus  et omnes  Explorat ventos atque curibus aera captat  HISTORY OF  HOLYWELL PARISH  LONDON▪  HISTORY OF  HOLYWELL PARISH  AT  Avonmarsh Siambr  see p we quit the parish of  Whiteford  and enter the township of  Greenfield  in the parish of  Holywell  along a most excellent road On the left is a continuation of the marsh Above which is a low cliff of the same nature as those which front the shore of the parish of  Whiteford  LET me preface this little history with saying that  Avon Marsh Siambr  is six miles distant from the rill which divides  Holywell  parish from that of  Flint  that its greatest breadth is three miles from the turnpike road in  Greenfield  to the borders of the parish of  Skyviog  TOWNSHIPS  and that the parish consists of the townships of  Holywell Greenfield Bagillt Vawr  and  Vechan Whelston Coleshill Vawr  and  Vechan Brynfordd  and  Calcoed  Its  boundaries on the east are  Flint  and part of  Northop  parishes on the east  Halkin  on the southeast  Skyviog  on the west  Whiteford  and on the north the estuary of the river  Dee  S  ABOVE  Avonmarsh Siambr  on the rising ground stands  S  cky    a small house which with the estate belonging to it has been of late years purchased by  James Potts  publican in  Holywell  and the house much improved It originally belonged to a  Mostyn  a younger branch of the  Mostyns  of  Trelacre T M  signifying the name of  Thomas Mostyn  cut above the arms on the monument A daughter of this gentleman or one of his descendants and heiress of the place transferred the estate into the very antient family of the  Blounts  of  Orlton  in the county of  Hereford  and with them it remained till the purchase by the present possessor  RIVER DEE COMPANY  THE rights of the freeholders over the marsh extend a certain way to the east These were settled by commissioners in the year and a plan made asserting the clames as well of the freeholders as of the  River Dee Company  These were founded on acts of parlement originating in the years and the following from that of the th and th of  William  III entitled  An act to enable the mayor and citizens of  Chester  to recover and preserve the navigation of the river  Dee  It is possible that Mr  Andrew Yarrenton  might be the primary cause of the improvements by a survey he had made in the year of the river  Dee  and its estuaryI refer my reader to the account I have given at p of my  Welsh Tour  vol i for farther particulars  THE other acts were passed in the years and and the works were begun with vigor The project was carried on by subscription and the adventurers were to be  rewarded by the lands they were empowered to gain on both sides from the  White Sands  or the sea from  Chester  and between the county of  Cheshire  on the north side and the county of  Flint  on the south side being sands soil and ground not bearing grass The tract as appears by the chart attending the award made in and preserved among the records by the clerk of the peace for the county of  Flint  terminate on our side at the  Point of Air  in the parish of  Llanasaph  on the  Cheshire  side at the  Little Meels  at the extremity of the hundred of  Wiral  THE adventurers in the River  Dee  Company have gained a considerable quantity of land from the ravages of the sea beginning from the walls of the city of  Chester  and extending above five miles even beyond the lower ferry  THE report of the quantity of embanked land made from the beginning by the River  Dee  Company and others according as it is made to me by Mr  Wedge  agent to the company is as follows  Acres inclosed by the company    On  Blaconmarsh  belonging to  John Crewe  of  Crewe  esquire about    On the south side of the river belonging to the freeholders of  Hawarden  as Mr  Wedge  believes about    Total statute acres    Marshes uninclosed  August  th about    MR WEDGE informs me that the grass which is found to answer best in these sandy inclosures is  medicago sativa Lucerne  LUCERNE GRASS  It  will not however grow to any perfection on land where there is not a depth of at lest two feet of dry sand or soil beneath the surface and succeeds like most other grass  in proportion to the quality of the soil All kinds of stock are  of it it is of a very feeding nature and is both grazed  rvested Close grazing will destroy it but if properly attended to and assisted with manure about every f  ye  r the plants will continue strong for upwards of thirty years It may be grazed sparingly with safety in the spring until the first week in  May  and also in autumn in the months of  October  and  November  after the second crop is out The hay being of a dying nature seems to be much better adapted for feeding stock than either for horses or milking cows I know no kind of hay that stock will feed faster upon than  Lucerne  if it is well harvested as grass it will answer best for soiling stock when housed  LAST E  BANKMENT  NO attempts to embank were made farther to the west till the summer of when about forty statute acres were inclosed by the same company on the white sands bordering on  Greenfield  marsh Early in the next winter a fierce tide destroyed part of the embankment but it now seems to be restored in the most effectual manner  While this confident paragraph was in the press on the morning of  October  th a fiercer tide assisted by a fiercer wind has almost ruined the inclosure and made such breaches as may probably deter the company from any further attempts to restore it    PROJECTS  NEAR the extremity of this marsh the turnpike gates cross the roads leading to  Flint  and  Holywell  A grand and beneficial  project was some years ago formed of making two canals The one to be carried over the marsh assisted by the  Holywell  stream down to or near the perch or anchoringground with a lock capable of receiving vessels of a hundred tons burden  ANOTHER canal was designed to have branched from this eastward as far as  Pentre r  k  near  Flintcastle  for the purpose of carrying the coal which was or may be discovered on that tract either to the various mineral works or into the lock for exportation I trust if ever the plan is resumed that it may extend a little farther to the collieries belonging to Sir  Roger Mostyn  and myself and others which may be discovered hereafter Nor see we any reason for our exclusion by so impolitic a partiality The more choice of shops the cheaper the goods Both of the plans were taken by the able engineer Mr  William Jessop  in the year and declared to be practicable The expence indeed would have been very great but alas the aspect of the times forbids us to flatter ourselves with the resumption of the great design  THE  Mark  or place where the vessels lie to receive or discharge their lading is about two miles from the turnpike gate  THE MARK  The channel of the  Holywell  river is to be seen at low water meandring to it and might prove a useful means of improving the commerce of the country At present the vessels must on the recess of the tide lie dry and in hard gales before they get afloat are subject to much danger The sands also shift and make the  Mark  or anchoringground often precarious  THE River  Dee  Company have power to inclose as far as the channel of the  Dee  which in  Holywell  parish is supposed to extend  as far as three miles from the turnpike road In a late act of parlement for ascertaining the rights of the parish and those of the company in the spring of the agents for the company after the act to confirm a line of boundary between the property of the company and the part of the marsh which was common had been twice read introduced clauses to render their property extraparochial and consequently to exempt the occupiers from contributing to the church and poor and other parochial rates of  Holywell Whiteford  or any parishes concerned and also to exempt future householders from being liable to execute any offices within those parishes and at the expence of others artfully attempting to exonerate their tenants from bearing any part of the burdens But the design was discovered and the offensive clause omitted  THE company have obtained a grant of all their lands from the parish of  Hawarden  to that of  Whiteford  under the following circumstances  Lands derelict by the sea belong to his prerogative and being consequently extraparochial the tythes are due to the king and if he grants them his patentee shall have them  Such is the opinion of Sir  John Comyns  as conveyed to me by the favor of  Edward Jones  esquire of  Wepre  hall  WAT'S DIKE  ON passing the turnpike gate a small walk brings us to the site of the abby and castle of  Basingwerk  a place of importance in the wars between the  English  and  Welsh  The land towards the sea is steeply sloped The west side was protected by a deep gully formed by the river The south east by the vast ditch which had hitherto been mistaken for that made by  Ossa  king  of the  Mercians  I owe the detection of the error to Mr  John Evans  of  Llwyn y Groes  who proves it to b  one termination of another stupendous work of the same kind called  Wat's Dike  which appears by his ma  nificent map of NORTH WALES published this year to have first become visible near  Maesbury  mill in  Oswestry  parish where it is lost in morassy ground from thence it takes a northern direction to  Hên ddinas  and by  Pentre'r Clawdd  to  Gobowen  the site of a small sort called  Bryn y Castell  in the parish of  Whittington  then crosses  Prys Henlle Common  in the parish of  St Martin  goes over the  Ceir  g  between  Brynkinallt  and  Pont y Blew  forge and the  Dee  below  Nant y Bela  from whence it passes through  Wynnstay Park  by another  Pentre 'r Clawdd  or township on the ditch to ERDDIG the seat of  Philip Yorke  esq  where there was another strong fort on its course from  Erddig  it goes above  Wrexham  near  Melin Puleston  by  Dolydd Maesgwyn Rhôs ddu Croes oneiras  Mr  Shakerley  's  Gwersyllt  crosses the  Alun  and through the township of  Llai  to  Rhydin  in the county of  Flint  above which is  Caerestyn  a  British  post from hence it runs by  Hope  church along the side of  Molesdale  which it quits towards the lower part and turns to  Mynydd Lychdyn Monachlog  near  Northop  by  Northop  mills  Brynmoel Coed y llys Nant y Flint Cefn y Coed  through the  Strand fields  near  Holywell  to its termination below the abby of  Basingwerk  I have been thus minute in giving its course because it is so often confounded with  Offa  's ditch which attends the former at unequal distances from five hundred yards to three miles till the latter is totally lost  IT is observable that there are numbers of small artificial mounts the sites of small forts in many places along its course  as well as that of  Offa  's These were garrisoned and seem intended for the same purposes as the towers in the famous  Chinese  wall to watch the motions of neighbors and to repel any hostile incursions  IT is remarkable that  Wat  's dike should have been overlooked or confounded with that of  Offa  by all writers except by  Thomas Churchyard  the poet who assigns the object of the work that the space intervening between the two was free ground where the  Britons  and  Saxons  might meet with safety for all commercial purposes  B  INGWERK CASTLE  VESTICES of the fortress appear in the foundation of a wall on the edge of the ditch and on the road side near the turnpike gate opposite to the ruins of the abby Lord  Lytteiton  Hist  He  ry  II d edit ii quoted in  Coll Curious Discourset  i  says that the founder was an earl of  Chester  I imagine that it must have been  Richard  son of  Hugh Lupus  and second earl of  Chester  and that the abby was fortified by reason of a danger he had incurred near the abby for even religious  tutions had no exemption  tempore necessitatis l  lli  citum est  hospitari et in castellari in ecclesia  Innocentius de  mmu  itate ecclesia    THE first notice I find of it is in the life of St  Werburg  by  Bra  s  aw  who informs us that  Richard  on his return out of  Normandy  where he had been educated began his reign with an act of piety He attempted in a pilgrimage to the well of St  Wene  rede  but either in going or returning was attacked by the  Welsh  and obliged to take shelter in  Basingwerk  He applied to St  W  burg  for relief who miraculously raised certain sands between  Flintshire  and  Wiral  and thus gave means  to his constable to pass to his assistance which sands from that time were called the  Constable's Sands Bradshaw  styles the place of his retreat an abby a proof that here had been a religious community before the time usually assigned for the foundation of this house I must also draw from Lord  Lyttelton  's authority for I can find no other that this castle was demolished by the  Welsh  in the reign of  Stephen  Hist Henry  II    HENRY II in after his escape from the ambuscade of  Eulo  left  Basingwerk  restored well fortified and manned  M Pa    in order to secure a retreat on any future disaster He did the same by the castle of  Ruddlan  In his days the inland parts of our county were a dangerous wild of forest After his defeat he never trusted himself among our woods but made his marches along the open shores  THE same monarch left another species of garrison  Pow  l    for he established here a house of knights templars a military order introduced into  England  in the preceding reign They were first instituted in the Holy Land for the protection of pilgrims and possibly  Henry  might have the same in view in fixing them here to secure the  English  devotees in performing their vows to our neighboring saint who seems about this time to have come into reputation It is singular that these religious knights were allowed at their institution only one horse between two yet so greatly did they flourish that about the year or a hundred and fifty years after their institution the order had acquired in different parts of  Christendom  nineteen thousand manors  THIS castle was but of very short duration for in the gallant prince  Owen Gwynedd  laid siege to it took  Powel    and levelled  it to the ground after which the name occurs no more as a fortress I think at this period it belonged to  Hugh de Bello Campo  or  Beauchamp  on whom this and  Ruddlan  castle had been bestowed by the  English  monarch  Annales Waver  ienses      ABBY  THE abby  Called also by the  Welsh Maesglas  or  Greenfield  of which there are some considerable remains was founded in according to the opinion of Bishop  Tanner  by  Randal  the second earl of  Chester  according to Bishop  Fleetwood  by  Henry  II For my part I believe it to be of greater antiquity but do not pretend to derive its origin No light into the matter can be collected from the charters preserved by Sir  William Dugdale  There are three of them either serving to confirm the antient donations or confer new in each is mention of the earl as a benefactor but there is not the lest hint of his having been the founder I must attribute that honor to one of the princes of  Wales  for both  Lhewelyn ap Jorwerth  and his son  David  in their respective charters recite that they give and confirm the several donations to GOD St  Mary  the monastery of  Basingwerk  and the monks which had been bestowed on them by their predecessors for the salvation of their souls  RANDAL was certainly a great benefactor for it appears that before his days the monks had only a chapel here From that period it became considerable and about that time part of the present buildings were erected for the conveniency of its inhabitants who were of the  Cistercian  order  GIRALDUS calls it  cellula de Basingwerk  I  in Camb  lib ii c  He lodged here a night in the train of Archbishop  Baldwyn  on his progress through  Wales  to preach the crusade He took with him our eloquent countryman on account of his skill in the  Welsh  language  THE architecture is mixed Here appears what is called  Saxon  having the round arches and short columns in some parts and the Gothic narrow slips of highpointed win lows in others The first species had not fallen out of use and the last was coming into fashion in the days of the first great benefactor  THE church lay on the east side but is now almost destroyed The refectory is pretty entire and on one side has a great recess with two round arches The pillars which support them are very curious formed of circular stones of the form of cheeses set close one upon the other  ABOVE were the cells for the lodgings of the monks with a small window to each  THE chapel of the knights templars is a spacious building The windows are long narrow and pointed the pilasters between them on the inside slender and elegant  WHATEVER monuments or inscriptions might have been in the church are totally destroyed unless that which may be found in one of the outhouses It preserves the memory of a pious emigrant of the last century  George  youngest and eighth son of  William  second Lord  Petre  who plagued with the fanatical persecutions in the reign of  Charles  I quitted his country died at  Wexford  and was brought

the abby is supposed to have been his cotemporary  I HAVE spoken of his son and successor  Nicholas  at pp and shall again in the article  Bagillt  resume the subject  THE whole road from the abby to St  Wenefrede  's well is most remarkably picturesque along a narrow but deep valley bounded  on one side by hanging woods In former times the sacred stream hurried to the sea unconfined by the busy manufactures During the reign of pilgrimages nothing but the cornmills the property of the monks found employ for its waters  BEFORE I advance up the valley let me observe that notwithstanding it has the common causes of health a rapid stream and the greatest part of the year a brisk wind usually from west to east yet it is visited with the usual diseases of the country in a degree even greater than other parts nor has the  angina maligna  hereafter to be spoken of spared the children of this little tract  COMMERCE found its way to the valley about fifty years ago  WHITE AND RED LEAD WORKS  I can remember the building of the works of white and of red lead under the conduct of Messrs  Smedley  But prior to these a little above was a tiltingmill and an ironwire mill  IRONWIRE MILL  The first lessees were  Hart  and Co from  Yorkshire  They were succeeded by Mr  Barker  and Sir  James Creed  who erected a new one on the lower part of the stream On Mr  Barker  's death the remainder of the term was purchased by Mr  John Norman  and Mr  Rouben Chambers  Under a new leafe Mr  John Chambers  converted the old mill into a steelwiremill before which his mother used it for a warehouse for a coarsepapermill  PAPER MILLS  The  Parys  mine company succeeded to both the premises and covered them with their important edifices  IT must be observed that the antient cornmills belonging to the abby stood where the papermill was the  molendina quae juxta portam abbatiae habent  Dugdale Monast  I    SNUFF MILLS  ON this stream had been three snuffmills the oldest was occupied by Mr  Edward Jones  tobacconist now living It joined the old and uppermost cornmill It was taken down by the cotton company who on the site built part of the new cornmill near the  Holywell  spring  PETER PARRY tobacconist had two snuffmills one on the land of  John Pierce  joiner deceased a little below the crescent cottonmill It was purchased by the brass batteringmill company for the sake of giving their pool a little greater depth of water which built another for  Peter Parry  below their brassworks  OLD SMELTINGWORK  AN antient smeltingwork stood in my memory on the site of the old cottonmill and part of the garden They were erected before the year by lease from  Roger Pennant  esq  of  Bagillt  I do not recollect the names of the lessees but the company was known by that of Madam  Kaye  and Co The smoke did such injury to the fine woods belonging to Sir  George Mostyn  of  Trelacre  bart as to occasion many lawsuits between Sir  George  and the company so that there ensued a total cessation of the smeltingtrade in these works Whether the suit came to a decision does not appear The suit must have commenced before  March  th from which day all proceedings which used before to be in  Latin  were to be carried on in the  English  tongue Just before that period poor Sir  George  suffered a nonsuit for using the word  propè  instead of  juxta  and was foiled a second time by using in the proceeding the title of Sir  George Mostyn  instead of  George Mostyn  esq  his elder brother being living and at that time an ecclesiastic in the church of  Rome  and it  is said that he suffered a third repulse by stating that the works were in the township of  Greenfield  instead of  Holywell  or  vice versa  HOW the affair ended I cannot learn The building reverted into the hands of the heirs of the lessors  Edward Pennant  esq  granted a lease of it in to Mr  Champion  partner and agent in the  Wormley  company near  Bristol  who there calcined  blackjack  He was the first who engaged in such a concern in this country and probably in  Great Britain  which he carried on under the protection of a patent  A PINMILL was built in for the use of  James Eden  PINMILL  pinmaker who occupied it about two years and then failed The next occupier was Mrs  Chambers  who converted it into a coarsepaper mill and continued the use of it till when it fell into the hands of the cottoncompany which turned it into a smithy and finally three cornmills  THREE CORNMILLS  formed with the above the sum of the works upon the stream in my early days The lower of these two reckoning from the well was pulled down  IN the year began the memorable epoch in the annals of our famous stream when the late Mr  Patten  of  Warrington  FAMOUS EPOCH OF COMMERCE  and Co built the first batteringmill for copper and brass In about ten years from that time Mr  John Smalley  now deceased introduced the first manufacture of cotton By his successors and by the great coppercompanies those  behemoths  of commerce our little  Jordan  was soon drunk up By their skill and industry they succeeded to the benefit of the state and to their private emolument  Tho  Williams  esquire  Member for  Marlow  that useful and active character with unparalleled speed covered the lower part of the stream or that next to the sea with buildings stupendous in expence extent and ingenuity of contrivance These great works are under the firm of the PARYS MINE COMPANY  PARYS MINE COMPANY  The buildings were completed in the year and held under lease from Sir  Pyers Mostyn  bart owner of the whole stream excepting a small part To Mr  Samuel Williamson  chief agent of this part of the works I am indebted for the account of the works carried on here These are entirely confined to the manufacture of copper  IN this department is a great forge for heating the cakes of copper previously to their being beat into pans or rolled into sheathings c c The wheels and machinery are set in motion by the water from a large pool parallel to the road which is filled from the stream and let out by another channel to effect its purposes  THESE may be called the great magazines for the supply of the royal navy with the various necessaries in copper such as sheathings bolts and nails Some of the bolts are twenty feet long and so hardened by rolling and battering as to be capable of being driven almost to their heads in the entrance forward and run abaft of the ships where the beds of timber are the thickest which work is facilitated by boring with an anger twothirds of the length  SOME of the nails are a foot in length and from that size to that of a sadler's cack  RUDDER bands and braces are here made of an enormous  size some designed for the largest firstrates weighed one ton fourteen hundred  THE number of men employed in these works is ninetythree This is intended when they are in full employ the same must be understood of all the rest  THE head of water to this mill is about twentyone feet and a half and the superficial surface of the pool about feet  THE trade of these works is not confined to the royal navy The merchant ships are from hence supplied with considerable quantities of sheathing bolts and nails as are many of the ships in the service of the  East India  Company  FROM hence braziers are furnished with copper vessels of all kinds and the materials for all the copper branches of their business  THE works on this river are supplied with their copper from the  Parys  mine and  Mona  mine companies the ore of which is smelted chiefly at  Ravenhead  and  Stanley  in  Lancashire  THE  Cornish  ores are smelted at  Swansey Neath Bristol  and in  Cornwal  THE Duke of  Devonshire  's ores at  Whiston  in  Derbyshire  THE number of vessels immediately employed by the coppercompanies on this river to convey the several manufactures or the materials to and from  Leverpool  and the other places connected with them amount to between thirty and forty from thirty to fifty tons burden  MR WILLIAMS has besides the works on the  Holywell  stream two near  Marlow  in  Buckinghamshire  upon as large a scale as those in  Greenfield  There are also in this kingdom others belonging  to different proprietors at  Congleton  and  Macclesfield  in  Cheshire  at  Swansey  and  Bris    and in  Cornwel  and a number in the vicinity of  London  THE COMPANY'S COIN  I MUST not be silent on the subject of the most beautiful coin or token in use by this great company as it exceeds in elegance any which has been yet emitted On one side is the head of a  Druid  emblematic of the isle of  Mona  the antient seat of the venerable order and which now produces the material of the coin On the reverse is the cypher of  Parys  mountain with a promissory legend to pay one penny or one halfpenny as it happens to be in  London Anglesey  or  Leverpool  to bearer on demand  VAST quantities of these coins are counterfeited at  Birmingham  and may be had by public order in any number  BRASS MELTINGHOUSES  ABOVE these works is a great cluster of vast square chimnies the discharge of the tremendous volumes of thick black smoke rising from the making of brass These are the brass meltinghouses belonging to the  Greenfield  copper and brass company under the direction of Mr  Donbavand  where they have six large melting houses with twentyfour fires each fire contains nine pots with metal fluxes c Here they make platebrass for the purpose of being manufactured at their batterymills platebrass for wire for the pinmanufacturers and ingotbrass for the various founders c At this place they have a mill places to calcine buddle and grind the  lapis calaminaris  c for the purpose of making brass also a copper forge not used at present the head of water is about ½ feet superficial surface of the pool about feet The number of the men employed in these works is about fifty The materials for the making of  brass are all at hand The copper shot and clippings are from the adjacent works the calamine from our own mines and the charcoal from our woods The art of making brass in early times is mentioned before at pp The first patent for the calamine stone and the use thereof was granted to  William Humsrey  and  Christopher Shutz  dated the th of  September  at which time the long lost art in these kingdoms began to revive  IN digging the foundation for the brass meltinghouses  HYPOCAUST  Mr  Donbavand  discovered an antient  Roman  hypocaust furnished with various flues with the superincumbent tiles of a fine red color These artificial hot baths and sweatingrooms were the greatest luxuries of the  Romans  This proves that they had a stationary settlement in this place probably of merchants concerned in the mineral works which they certainly had on the adjacent mountains of which I have given an account in p of this book  NOT far from this work on the eastside of the river  WIREWORK  is the great manufactory of brass wire of every denomination Also here are drawn the square materials for making copper nails which are formed by the common process of beating and heading This work has a head of twentythree feet which is capable by means of an extensive pool that may be formed above of having a very large work built on the now vacant spot  AT a small distance to the south  COTTONWORK  a most magnificent cottonwork soars like the tower of  Babel  above all the lower buildings I shall here only say that about ten weeks before its completion nothing but a void appeared before me at the expiration of that space in another ride I took I cannot express my astonishment at seeing the enormous mass risen as if by magic out of the  ground It was erected in the summer of is thirtysix yards long ten yards wide and six stories high and is worked with a waterwheel eighteen feet high and seven feet wide with a fall of water of sixteen feet  NE  POLLING MILL  AT some distance beyond this is the NEW ROLLING MILL erected in  This is superintended by Mr  Joseph Thomas  to whom I am indebted for the account  The largest and most commodious building for the purpose it is applied to of any in the kingdom Its area within the walls measures eightysix feet in length by sixtynine in breadth floored with iron flags Its height in the center is twentyeight feet and an half The roof is single and covered with copper supported in the center by two pillars eleven feet and a half distant from each other on their tops are transverse timbers supporting one end of each beam which more immediately sustains the roof the other end resting on the wall  THE waterwheels are of castiron upon a curious construction They are three in number each of which receives its supply of water at a height of about fortyfive degrees from an ironpipe fixed in the bottom of the penstock and so fitted to the buckets of the wheel that scarce any water is wasted of which we are studiously careful Wheels so receiving their water are called  breastwheels  of which kind I believe all the wheels on this stream are excepting that belonging to the cornmill and another at this company's brassworks which is used for grinding calamine the water by that mode of delivery communicating the most powerful impulse and the most steady motion The ironwheels here are twenty feet diameter and they will when unclogged with  heavy weights perform twenty revolutions in a minute Now if we suppose a wheel of that diameter moving upon a plane with the same rapidity with which it revolves on its axis it will in a year describe a line nearly equal in length to five circles of our globe at the equator The yard and reservoir of water pertaining to this noble manufactory are suitable to its magnitude and by much the most spacious on the  Holywell  stream  THE number of men employed here are about fortysix  REMARKS  st IT is a certain fact that the people constantly employed in the coppermanufactories are as healthy and arrive to as great an age as the generality of people employed in other occupations not connected with fire or metal but they are scrupulous observers of the antient law which forbade to eat with unwashen hands and they find it highly necessary to perform a careful ablution of the whole body at lest once a week to rub off the copper dust which adheres to their bodies and occasions violent eruptions of a green color evincing by the tinge their origin The pain and symptoms are easily removed by washing with clean water but if that is neglected the consequences become serious and even to require chirurgical assistance  d YOUNG dogs which have acquired a habit of licking copper sheets or bars have never been known to survive long The metallic virus by that means conveyed into the intestines soon destroys the animal by violent purging  d YET it may deserve notice that the writer of these hints having formerly kept a great number of poultry running about the yard he observed that the fowls preferred drinking the water from a shallow copper pan that lay out of doors and was generally full of rainwater tinged of a deep green color to fresh clear water of which there was abundance No ill effect was ever known to have happened to them from the green water though a succession of poultry resorted to it for years  THE writer of this having been employed on the spot from the first opening of the ground for the foundations of the mill and other buildings found frequent proofs that the surface of the land had formerly been about fourteen or sixteen feet lower than at the time the buildings were erected His inducements to form that opinion were  st THAT though the soil contained many large pebbles throughout its whole depth yet at the depth of twelve to sixteeen or eighteen feet grey pebbles of large size were every where found in great abundance and mixed with sand or gravel just as they appear on the shelving shores of many rivers  d AT the depth of fifteen feet under the wood where the warehouse now stands the head of a battleaxe was picked up The writer not chancing to be on the spot when it was taken up could gather no information whether any part of the handle remained but supposes not He was shewn the spot where it lay and measured fifteen feet to the surface  d AND the most decisive proof is that after cutting down an oaktree of pretty large girth and afterwards clearing away the root in digging still deeper for the foundation of the present  warehouse the workmen found a limekiln of very small dimension perhaps it would contain half a ton of limestone but perfect and having calcined lime in its bason It was constructed of the same kind of red sandstone as that now below  Wepre  The bottom of that kiln now forms the lowest foundation of the northeast corner of the warehouse which is nea  ly level with the surface of the cottonmillpool below it  IMMEDIATELY above the last are the works under the superintendency of Mr  Daniel Donbavand  GREENFIELD COPPER AND BRASS COMPANY  who with great civility informed me of their origin and consequent improvements These are on the site of the brassbatterymills built in the year and set to work th  Sept  The first brass made at  Greenfield  was on the th  August  then held by Mess  Patten  and Co Since  January  they have been in the hands of  Thomas Williams  esq  and Co under the firm of  The Greenfield Copper and Brass Company  who have very much improved them by various erections so as to enable them to finish goods for  Africa America  and most other markets  viz  brass  Neptunes  or large pans in which the negroes make salt pans for getting the gold out of their rivers and for various other purposes kettles brass and copper rods bright and black  manillas  the first are rings for ornaments to the arms and legs the last for the current money of the country The last are not unlike the golden bracelets of the antient  Britons  the ends turned up and flatted and add to these various sorts of  latten  brass c for mathematical instruments c c  THE word  latten  is applied to works in brass with which for certain purposes is an admixture of any other metal Sometimes  it is made a synonym of brass itself  Watson's Essays  IV and in the same page and  Stringer  in his  Opera Mineralia Explicate  p gives us the qualities of the said  latten  as explained in the patent of th  Elizabeth  to  Humphrey  and  Shutz  abovementioned which was granted to  Shutz  for  his great cunning knowlege and experience as well in the finding the calamine stone called in  Latin lapis calaminaris  and in the right and proper commodity thereof for the composition of mixed metal commonly called  latten  and in reducing it to be soft and malleable and also in apting manuring and working the same for and into all sorts of battery wares castwork and wire and also in the mollifying and manuring of iron and drawing and forging of the same into wire and plates for the making of armor and also for divers other needful and profitable uses  THE word  latten  is also used for a distinct metal as appears by two patents one of the th  Henry  VI to his chaplain and controller of all his mines of gold c in  Devon  and  Cornwal  see  Stringer  p the other in the patent of th  Elizabeth  see  Watson  iv both which mention mines of  latten  But as the Bishop observes whatever the name did mean it is now lost I can only say that calamine does appear in so many and so different forms that the application might have been to one of them since the qualities seem to have been the same  THE head of water to these mills is about ½ feet and the superficial surface of the pool or reservoir about feet  BRA  WORKES  ALL the pools belonging to the several works are well stocked with trout brought from the river  Wheeler  which flows beneath  Caerwis  They grow to a vast size I have heard of one which had been taken in the brass millpool which weighed between eleven pounds and twelve pounds but those overgrown fish do not equal in flavor those of an inferior size The threespined stickleback  Br Zool  iii N  o  a little fish seldom of the length of two inches abound in this stream but especially in the stiller parts where the water has been confined for the use of the works Eels are the only fish besides these found in these waters  THOSE beautiful birds the kingfishers are very frequent about these waters and almost dazzle the eye in their frequent transitions from place to place  THIS work was erected in the spring of    CRESCENTMILL  is twentysix yards by ten wide and is six stories high It is worked by a waterwheel fifteen feet high and ten feet wide with a fall of water of thirteen feet and a half This work makes a noble figure on the stream is ornamented with a handsome cupola with a fine gilden crescent on the top from which it receives its name  A CORNMILL stood on part of the site of this mill  CORNMILL  On the stream had been within these few years a tiltingmill under the direction of Mr  William Smalley  which has since been removed to  Avon Wen  below  Caerwis  and a wiremill on an extensive scale has been erected on the  Wheeler  at a small distance from the tiltingmill in the beautiful vale of  Maes Mynnan  OLD COTTONMILL  A LITTLE beyond the crescentmill is the  Old Cotton Mill  or that which was first known on the stream It was erected in the spring of the year by Mr  John Smalley  of  Preston  in  Lancashire  He died  January  th aged and was interred in  Whiteford  churchyard On his tomb mention is made of his having at  Holywell  established the cottonworks This mill is small and low is yards long yards wide and only three stories high and is worked by a waterwheel feet high and feet wide with a fall of water of feet inches  MR  John Smalley  senior had long been engaged in a cottonwork at  Cromford  near  Mat  ck  in  Derbyshire  unhappily within the baleful influence of a tyrant rival which forced him to seek the protection of St  Wenefrede  under which he prospered and his children still prosper blessing the benefit of the change made by their injured parent  GREATEST COTTONMILL  A LITTLE way above this mill is the largest and most magnificent of any on the water It was erected in the autumn of the year in the space of six weeks from laying the foundationstone It is yards long yards wide and stories high and is lighted by a hundred and ninetyeight sash windows which nightly exhibit a most glorious illumination It is worked by a waterwheel feet high and feet wide with a fall of water of feet  ALL the cottonmills on the river go under the name of the  Cotton Twist  Company It is to Mr  Christopher Smalley  one of the partners and eldest son to the founder of these great manufactories I am obliged for the account of what relates to them  THE cottontwist company have between three and four hundred apprentices which they clothe and feed themselves  MANAGEMENT OF THE CHILDREN  in commodious houses built for that purpose the boys and girls in separate houses These houses are whitewashed twice every year are fumigated three times a week through every apartment with smoak of tobacco besides this the sleepingrooms are washed twice a week and the bedstocks are frequently sprinkled with rectified oil of tar All the windows in the sleepingrooms open at the tops by which a thorough draft of air is admitted during the whole time the children are at work To these and other precautions the good state of health of so many children may be justly attributed for though the number of apprentices have not been less than  for these seven years past they have only buried seven Their food for dinner is beef or pork and potatoes three or four times a week the other days herrings and potatoes or soup and bread and cheese as much as they please to eat Their breakfasts and suppers in summer is milk and bread in the winter when milk cannot be had they drink porridge or broth with bread and cheese A surgeon is appointed to superintend their health and a  Sunday  school is regularly attended by a master at each house  OUR little children sleep three in a bed  THEIR BED  the larger sizes only two and those who work in the night are so far from succeeding each other in the same beds that they do not even sleep in the same rooms  The number of men employed at  Greenfield  are  above  women and children  above  At  Northop    At  Denhigh    At  Sky  g    At  Newmarket  above  Apprentices  above  Total    COTTON wool is produced in the  East  and  West Indies  and also in many other places The Isle of  Bowbon  in the  East Indies  furnishes the best the next to this in quality grows in the  Portuguese  settlements in  South America  from whence it is exported to  Lisbon  and imported from thence to  England  in  British  bottoms dutyfree If in foreign bottoms a penny  per  pound is paid About fifteen years ago not more than five hundred bags were cultivated in the  Brazils  but of late years on an average fifty thousand The  Dutch  settlements say  Berbice  and  Surinam  supply a considerable quantity of good cotton and comes to this country better cleaned than any other  THE cottonplant grows naturally in  China  and  India  The cultivation travelled westward into  Arabia Persia  and the  Levant  It is also cultivated in the province of  Valencia  in  Spain  with vast success On the plains of that rich province in good years about four hundred and fifty thousand  arrobas  of lb each are harvested I suppose all this to be manufactured in  Spain  at lest I do not hear of any being imported into our kingdoms  COTTON twist is spun here of hanks to the pound Each hank is yards long so that one pound of cotton thread thus fine will be miles yards long The new principle for it is not yet years old by which cotton wool is made so perfect a thread is by the use of ironrollers moving horizontally their speed is governed by brass wheels of different sizes and numbers calculated to produce what fineness is wanted the twist required is given by the flier and spindle The cottontwist made here is sent chiefly into  England  and  Scotland  to be woven into ginghams muslins muslinets dimities nankeens fine callicoes fustians c c which goods when finished are either admitted or smuggled into every part of the known world It is introduced into every part of the  Russian  dominions and even into the distant  Kamtschatka  A NUMBER of machines called  Mules  are also used here with success  MULES  this machine is a compound of the waterengine and the spinningjenny and being of a mixed breed was I presume the reason of its being so named It is a machine particularly adapted to the spinning of fine yarns and far exceeds every other yet discovered for that purpose  THE last mill on the river is a cornmill  CORNMILL  a large building erected by the cottontwist company instead of the old one and of another which stood a little lower down on the site of which stands part of the great cottonmill  THE length of the stream from the fountain to the marsh  LENGTH OF THE STREAM  is one mile and two hundred and thirtyfour

great increase of building but the latter has of late years received such an addition in works and in houses that almost the whole is a continued series of edifices of different kinds from the upper cornmill quite to the seaside Among them are a hundred and seventyseven houses for workmen of different occupations of which few indeed have been erected beyond my memory  THE origin of this useful stream is discovered at the foot of the steep hill beneath the town of  Holywell  or  Treffynnon  ST WENEFREDE'S WELL  to which it gave the name The spring boils with vast impetuosity out of a rock and is confined in a beautiful polygonal well covered with a rich arch supported by pillars  Mr  John Ingleby  has engraven a print of this elegant building from a drawing by himself which is sold by Mr  Cairus  bookseller  Holywell  The roof is most exquisitely carved in stone Immediately over the fountain is the legend of St  Wenefrede  on a pendent projection with the arms of  England  at the bottom Numbers of fine ribs secure the arch whose intersections are coupled with a sculpture  SOME are mere works of fancy grotesque figures of animals but the rest allude chiefly to the  Stanley  family This building and the chapel over it rose from the piety of that great house which left these memorials of its benefactions there are besides some marks of the illustrious donors for example the profile of  Margaret  mother to  Henry  VII and that of her husband the earl of  Derby  cut on the same stone  THE compliments to the  Stanleys  are very frequent The  wolf  's head is the arms of the earls of  Chester  it is inclosed in a garter in respect to Sir  William Stanley  knight of that order who had been chamberlain of that city and justiciary of  North Wales  The tun with a plant issuing out of it is a  rebus  the arms of his wife  Elizabeth Hopton  allusive to her name This proves that the building was erected before in which year Sir  William  lost his head The other badges of the same house are the stag's head the eagle's leg and the three legs the arms of the isle of  Man  WE also find that  Catherine  of  Arragon  widow to prince  Arthur  and afterwards the unfortunate wife of his brother  Henry  VIII was a benefactress to this building at left her arms appear here three pomegranates in a shield surmounted with a crown the badge of the house of  Granada  in memory of the expulsion of the  Moors  by her father  Ferdinand  Sandford's Gencal    The eagle seems also to belong to her being one of the supporters of the arms of her family  OVER one of the lesser arches on each side of the well are the dragon and grehound the supporters of the arms of  England  during the reign of  Henry  VII and part of that of  Henry  VIII The first was born by  Henry  VII as a badge of the house of  Tudor  which derived itself from  Cadwalader  last king of  Britain  who bore on his ensign a red dragon  Henry  in imitation of him at the battle of  Bosworth  carried on his standard a red dragon painted on white and green silk which afterwards gave rise to the office of  Rougedragon  among the heralds  ON one side of a wall that supports the roof was painted the tale of the tutelar saint at present almost defaced over it is inscribed  in honorem Sanctae Wenefredae  V M  IN another wall is an elegant nich in which stood a statue of the Virgin  Mary  pulled down as I have been informed in the year  I HAVE also heard that there had been another of St  Wenefrede  To grace the image on high festivals it is probable that  Isabel  countess of  Warwick  widow to the great  Richard  Beauchamp  left to St  Wenefrede  in her gown of russet velvet  Dugdale's Warwickshire  I    OVER this spring is a chapel  CHAPEL  of the same date with the other building a neat piece of gothic architecture but in a very ruinous state The east end is a pentagon and had five windows with elegant tracery The top arched and crossed with neat slender ribs It had been open to the body of the chapel but the fine arch which formed the division has been bricked up a great number of years ago On one side of the body is an oblong recess divided from it by three arches supported by pillars and within is a window impending over the well Under the centre window must have stood the altar The whole length of the chapel is fiftytwo feet the breadth is twenty The recess is twentysix feet long and eight broad The roof is neat woodwork This had been a free chapel in the gift of the bishop with the reserve of a stipend to the chapter but the rest of the offerings were to be expended on the chapel In  Richard  III's time the abbot and convent had from the crown ten marks  yerely for the sustentacione and salarie of a prieste at the chapelle of St Wynefride  Harl  n MSS  N  o    The chapel is the property of  Daniel Leo  esquire in right of his wife  Laetitia  sister to the late  John Davies  esquire of  Llanerch  THE following order for putting the chapel over the well into possession of a clergyman of the church of  Rome  was addressed to Sir  Roger Mostyn  baronet by the queen of  James  II  Sir ROGER MOSTYN  IT having pleased the king by his royall grant to bestow upon me y  antient chappell adjoining to St  Winifride  's well these are to desire you to give present possession in my name of the said chappell to Mr  Thomas Roberts  who will deliver this letter into y  hands It being also my intention to have the place decently repaired and put to a good use I further desire that you will affoard him your favour and protection that he may not be disturbed in the performance thereof You may rest assured that what you do herein according to my desire shall be very kindly remembered by  MAY y  e  th  WHITEHALL  Your good frind MARY REGINA  FREE SCHOOL  IN this chapel is kept the freeschool for sixteen boys with a settled salary from money laid out at interest of  l per annum  The vicar appoints the master which as far as I recollect has been a clergyman excepting in one instance  SUNDAY SCHOOLS  BESIDES the  Sunday  school where the cottoncompany's apprentices are instructed there is another parochial one kept in the chapel over the well This is supported by a general subscription through the parish and about seventy poor children are instructed by proper masters in reading writing and arithmetick The copper and brass companies are handsome subscribers but  they send only a few adults to be instructed in matters their more advanced years make them capable of learning  THIS room has been used as the hall for holding both the great and the quarter sessions I remember  Matthew Skinner  esquire chief justice of  Chester  holding the assizes there and I also recollect a quarter sessions the hall having been properly fitted up for the purpose But the distance from the center of the county was found so inconvenient that after these instances they were removed to  Flint  and finally to  Mold  where they still continue  THE window in this chapel impends a vast height over the bathing well  CHAPEL WINDOW  Several persons not in their sober senses have leaped into the water without receiving any other damage than the smart caused by the dashing on the surface from their exalted station Within my memory one  John Blackwall  of  Llanasaph  took a far more desperate leap into the same water from the churchyard wall almost adjoining to the chapel The leap would have been great had it been on level ground Here had he not reached the water the consequence would have been that of being dashed to pieces on the flags  THE bathingwell is an oblong feet by with steps for the descent of the fairsex or of invalids Near the steps two feet beneath the water is a large stone called the  wishingstone  It receives many a kiss from the faithful who are supposed never to fail in experiencing the completion of their desires provided the wish is delivered with full devotion and confidence  ON the outside of the great well close to the road  LITTLE SPRING  is a small spring once famed for the cure of weak eyes The patient made an offering to the nymph of the spring of a crooked pin and  sent up at the same time a certain ejaculation by way of charm but the charm is forgotten and the efficacy of the waters lost  THE well is common for I find by a decision of the court of chancery on a lawsuit respecting the lordship of  Holywell  between Sir  John Egerton  knight and  John Eldred  chancellor  Ellesmere  decrees  That on calling to mind that within the said manor there is a fountain or well of antient and worthy memory he doth not think fit that the petitioner or any other should have the property thereof notwithstanding the general words of the grant of the manor and therefore his lordship doth order that notwithstanding the said grant that the well shallcontinue as now it is or heretofore hath been saving to the petitioner and his heirs and assigns the benefit of the stream and watercourse with the appertainances  THERE are two different opinions about the origin of this stream One party makes it miraculous the other asserts it to be owing only to natural causes The advocates for the first deliver their tale thus  OF SAINT WENEFREDE  IN the seventh century lived a virgin of the name of  Wenefrede  of noble parents her father's name was  Thewith  a potent lord in the parts where  Holywell  now stands her mother's  Wenlo  descended from an antient family in  Montgomeryshire  and sister to St  Beuno Beuno  assumed the monastic habit retired to  Clynnog  in  Caernarvonshire  where he built a church and founded a convent After completing this work of piety he visited his relations in  Flintshire  and obtaining from his brotherinlaw a little spot at the foot of the hill on which he resided erected on it a church and took under his care his niece  Wenefrede  It is probable  that the saint used occasionally to make some residence in this country for near the entrance of the dingle opposite to the great cottonwork are two small fields called to this day  Gerddi Saint Beuno  or the gardens of St  Beuno  A NEIGHBORING prince of the name of  Cradocus  son of king  Alen  was struck with her beauty and at all events determined to gratify his desires He made known his passion to the lady who affected with horror attempted to escape The wretch enraged at the disappointment instantly pursued her drew out his sabre and cut off her head  Cradocus  instantly received the reward of his crime he fell down dead and the earth opening swallowed his impious corps  Higden  in his  Polychronicon  adds that even the descendants of this monster were visited with horrible judgments to be expiated only by a visit to this well or to the bones of the saint at

near the church The valley which from its uncommon dryness  was heretofore called  Sych  nant  now lost its name A spring of uncommon size burst from the place where the head rested The moss on its sides diffused a fragrant smell  Life of St  Wenefrede  from which the materials for this part are mostly taken  Her blood spotted the stones which like the flowers of  Adonis  annually commemorate the fact by assuming colors unknown to them at other times  Luctus monumenta manebim  Semper  A  ioni  mei repetitaque mortis imago  Annua plangoris pe  get simila  i  nostri  For thee blest maid my tears my endless pain  Shall in immortal monuments remain  The image of thy death each year renew  And prove my grief to distant ages true  ST BEUNO took up the head carried it to the corps and offering up his devotions joined it nicely to the body which instantly reunited The place was visible only by a slender white line encircling her neck in memory of a miracle which surpassed far that worked by St  Dionysius  who marched in triumph after decapitation with his head in his hands from  Mont martre  to St  Dennis  's  Histoire de l'abbaye de St  Denys    or that of St  Adelbertus  who in like circumstances swam across the  Vistula  To conclude St  Wenefrede  survived her decollation fifteen years She died at  Gwytherin  in  Denbighshire  where her bones  rested till the reign of king  Stephen  when after divine admonition they were surrendered to the abby of St  Peter  and St  Paul  at  Shrewsbury  The memory of the two great events that of her first death is celebrated on the d of  June  that of her translation the d of  November  THE first  Sunday  after St  James  's day is also kept in honor of certain saints  DYDD SUL Y SAINT  probably St  Wenefrede  and St  Beuno  not with prayers or with holy masses but in every species of frolick and excess It originated in the  Romish  church but I clear that congregation from being concerned in any part of the orgies which are I fear celebrated by persons of our own religion only who flock here on that day for most unsaintly ends The day is called  Dydd sul y Saint  or the  Sunday of the Saints  I wish I could trace the primaeval ceremonies and whether one might not have been the  Druidical  custom the  Deiseal  or  Deisol  or turning from the east to the west according to the course of the sun In some of the western isles the custom is still preserved with great devotion  Deas  signifies the right hand and  sul  the sun from the ceremony being performed with the right hand always next to the circle cairn or whatsoever they surround  See more in the learned  Porlase's Antiquities of Cornwall  to  It is possible that this custom might have been applied to our saint and the words  Deiseil  or  Deisol  corrupted for that purpose for  Dyddsol  for giving particular sanction to the  Sunday  in question  A FRATERNITY and gild was established in honor of our saint at  Shrewsbury  It had its common seal which  AN ANTIENT SEAL  through the  kindness of my friend Mr  Henry Levingston  is now in my possession It is of copper of the form expressed in plate VI of Vol I of my  Tour in Wales  In the center is a representation of the martyrdom above is a cross in form of a T placed between the letters  T m  which mark the time when the fraternity was instituted during the abbacy of  Thomas Mynde  who was elected in and died in a period in which these religious societies were much in fashion The T or cross refers to the church of St  Cross  within this monastery Beneath are probably the arms of the house a sword and a key symbols of its tutelar apostles and round the margin is this inscription  Sigillū cōe Ffraternitat beate Wenefride virginis  ī  eccia  sc̄e cruc ī fra monaster sc̄i Petri Salopie  A bell belonging to the church was also christened in honor of her I cannot learn the names of the gossips who as usual were doubtlessly rich persons On the ceremony they all laid hold of the rope bestowed a name on the bell and the priest sprinkling it with holy water baptized it in the name of the Father  c c  Stovely  's Hist Churches  He then clothed it with a fine garment after this the gossips gave a grand feast and made great presents which the priest received in behalf of the bell Thus blessed it was endowed with great powers allayed on being rung all storms diverted the thunderbolt drove away evil spirits  These consecrated bells were always inscribed The inscription on that in question ran thus  Sancta  Wenefreda  Deo hoc commendare memento  Ut pietate sua nos servet ab hoste cruento  And a little lower was another address  Protege l'rece pia quos convoco virgo  Marta  AFTER her death her sanctity says her historian was proved by numberless miracles The waters were almost as sanative as those of the pool of  Bethesda  all infirmities incident to the human body met with relief the votive crutches the barrows and other proofs of cures to this moment remain as evidences pendent over the well The saint is equally propitious to Protestants and Catholics for among the offerings are to be found these grateful testimonies from the patients of each religion  THE Holy Father gave all encouragement to the piety of pilgrims to frequent this fountain Pope  Martin  V  Selden  's notes on  Michael Drayton    in the reign of  Henry  V furnished the abby of  Basingwerk  with pardons and indulgences to sell to the devotees These were renewed again in the reign of queen  Mary  by the interest of  Thomas Goldwell  bishop of St  Asaph  Powel  's notes on  Gi  ald Cambr  Mr  Addison  says he saw his picture at  Ravenna  in the convent of  Theatins  among the eminent men of that order  who fled into  Italy  on the accession of  Elizabeth  Multitudes of offerings flowed in marks of gratitude from such who had received benefit by intercession of the virgin  THE resort of pilgrims of late years to these  Fontanalia  has considerably decreased the greatest number are from  Lancashire  In the summer still a few are to be seen in the water in deep devotion up to their chins for hours sending up their prayers or performing a number of evolutions round the polygonal well or threading the arch between well and well a prescribed number of times I am sorry to say that this excess of piety has cost several devotees their lives Few people of rank at present honor the fountain with their presence A crowned head in the last age dignified the place with a visit The prince who lost three kingdoms for a mass payed his respects on  August  th to our saint and received as a reward a present of the very shift in which his greatgrandmother  Mary Stuart  lost her head  The late Doctor  Cooper  of  Chester  's MSS  This prince gave in the course of his progress as marks of his favor golden rings with his hair platted beneath a crystal I have seen one which he had bestowed on a  Roman Catholic  priest of a nighboring family The majority of devotees are of the fair sex attracted hither to commemorate the martyrdom of St  Wenefrede  as those of the East did the death of the  Cyprian  favorite  Whose annual wound in  Lebanon  allur'd  The  Syrian  damsels to deplore his fate  In woeful ditties all the summer's day  While smooth  Ada  s  from his native rock  Ran purple to the sea supposed with blood  Of  Tha  yearly wounded  WE whose ancestors between two and three centuries ago abridged our faith to the mere contents of the Old and New Testament and to the creed called the  Apostles  do not think the belief in the above and other legends requisite I refer the reader to the arguments used by the antiquary Doctor  Powel  in his notes on the Itinerary of  Giraldus Cambrensis  and to Bishop  Fleetwood  's annotations on the life of the saint for proofs against the truth of the tale but with Protestants and temperate Catholics it carries with it selfconfutation  THE waters are indisputably endowed with every good quality attendant on cold baths and multitudes have here experienced the good effects that thus result from natural qualities implanted in the several parts of matter by the divine Providence in order to fulfil his will Heaven for a short period deigned to convince a dark and obdurate age with a series of miracles which were delivered down to succeeding times as incontestible proofs of the reality of the divine mission Without them a sufficient ground of trust and reliance upon the Supreme Being has long since been established Second causes innumerable are dispersed throughout the universe subordinate to the FIRST Every element proves to us a medicine or a bane as suits His unerring dispensation We cannot want we cannot have the mediation of poor departed mortals The supposition would be bestowing on them the attributes of the Deity omnipresence and omniscience  SOME eminent botanists of my acquaintance have reduced the sweet moss and the bloody stains to mere vegetable productions far from being peculiar to our fountain The first is  that kind of moss called  Jungermannia Asplenioides  Fl Angl  Tour in Wales  vol i tab imperfectly described and figured by  Dillenius  in his history of mosses which induced us to give a new engraving of it This species is also found in another holy well in  Caernarvonshire  called  Ffynnon Llanddeiniolen  in a parish of the same name  THE other is a  Byssus  likewise odoriferous common to  Lapland  and to other countries besides our own It adheres to stones in form of fine velvet  Linnaeus  calls it  Byssus Jolithus  S  P  i      Fl Lap  N  o    or the violetsmelling He says the stone to which it adheres easily betrays itself by the color being as if smeared with blood and if rubbed yields a smell like violets  Micheli  in his  Genera  of plants mentions the same  Gen tab fig  and  Schwenckfelt  discovered it among the vegetables of  Silesia  He calls it a  muscus subrubeus  and informs us that the smell is grateful to the heart and that if put among clothes it gives them a good scent and serves to drive away moths  C  Su    S  ae        Linnaeus  says  As quoted by Baron  Haller  N  o    that it is of use in eruptive disorders The  Conferva Gelatinosa  Syst Pl iv Fl Scot ii is found in the same well  TO THE  W  WHEEL  A SPECIES of moss is apt to vegetate on the oaken wheels of several of the mills of this stream These give shelter to multitudes of  animal  ae  These it is probable eat into the timber and occasion the ill same our river has obtained of having a corrosive quality Mr  William Chambers  of  Holywell  has assured me that he has seen the penstock and contiguous parts which lie  always under water in some parts pierced with a few holes in others eaten quite thorough and that the planks appeared after the moss was separated as if consuming by the wet rot He adds that the moss first adheres to the oaken planks and then it is that the small grubs eat into them and in some parts quite penetrate so that the moss becomes seemingly the nursery or receptacle of the grubs The method used to preserve the wheels was by scraping the moss off annually  THIS account is corroborated by Mr  Robert Tart  a very intelligent mastercarpenter who says that the wheels made of the best oak are destroyed remarkably soon by the  Holywell  stream A wheel which ought to have lasted thirty years has here been known to become unfit for use in about twelve Mr  Tart  recommends wheels made of pine or red deal and that the surface of the wheels be paid with pitch tar and ruddle but even this has proved ineffectual for the water occasions the mixture soon to peel away Mr  Donbavand  was so sensible of the evil as to substitute instead of timber wheels of castiron in the works which he superintends  EDWARD DAVIES an experienced wheelwright aged seventyfive confirms the above and adds that red deal perishes in the same manner but in a much slower degree by reason of its resinous quality There have been formerly instances of oaken planks which had laid long under water being found as full of holes as if they had been eaten through by  Norway  rats and were kept as curiosities by the late Messrs  Barker  of  Brynmadin  or  Gadlys  ON examination of the  animalcula  which occasion this damage we found them to be the  erucae  or caterpillars of a certain  insect which deposite its eggs in the moss the  Hyp  um riparium Flora  cot  ii we found them in the state of  erucae  about a third of an inch long and of a whitish color  WE found others arrived to the state of  pupae  or  chrysalides  of the same length as the caterpillar and of a deep brown color Whether these destructive insects are  ephemerae  or  phryganeae  of the class of insects which by a wonderful direction of nature deposite their eggs in waters of different depths I cannot ascertain It is certain that these genera before they assume the insect form remain under the water They from the egg become caterpillars these caterpillars rest a certain time in shape of  pupae  then burst out into flies or insects after that instantly quit the watery element In a still day they may be observed to make their appearance preceded by a bubble the insect immediately follows and either takes to the air or runs along the surface of the water before it rises into its new habitation  CHURCH  ABOVE the well stands the church dedicated to St  Wenefrede  The parish wakes are celebrated in  November  the time of her translation The living before the dissolution belonged to the abby of  Basingwerk  and is a vicarage in the gift of  Jesus College Oxford  which nominates and  Daniel Leo  esquire the layrector presents It was given away by  Robert Davies  to the college by deed dated expressing that as often as it became vacant the said  Robert Davies  and his heirs shall freely and  charitatis intuitu et absque aliqua morosa cunctatione  present a native of  Wales  rightfully and canonically nominated by the college  IN a letter dated th  October    Mutton Davies  grandson of the donor earnestly recommends to the college Mr  J Humphreys  adding  That by this I do not take upon me in the lest to detract from the gift my grandfather made the college but I glory in the honor to be descended from one who had the happiness to pay such respect to the society  In another letter dated  January  following after thanking the society for consenting to his request he adds  I should be as ungrateful as disingenuous should I convert your condescension herein to the disadvantage of your society by attempting hereafter to insinuate a right when I ought to commemorate a free obligation which induces me out of some congruity to my apprehension to send my eldest son to deliver this unto your hands and to gain him the honor of being known unto you which my illfortune hath denied me hitherto though I covet it very much  THE list of the vicars of  Holywell  from the year to the present time was communicated to me by my most worthy friend  Lewis  lord bishop of  St Asaph  It is entitled vicars of  Holywell Trefynnon  or  Ffynnon Gwenfrewi  Maurice ap David  d  Howel ap David

baronet and excepting  John Humphreys  was the only incumbent who was not a fellow of  Jesus College  Benjamin Havard  B D st  Sept    John Lloyd  B D d  March  Collated by the bishop to  Kilken  st  Aug    AN account of the tythes will be given in the Appendix with those of  Whiteford  parish  THIS vicarage even wants a globe unless we call the garden to the house by that name Neither has it any other endowment unless the share of tithes mentioned in the Appendix and an acquisition of Queen  Anne  's bounty of two hundred pounds This in the time of the Rev  Ellis Price  vicar received the addition of two hundred more which lay at interest till the last year when on the donation of a hundred and fifty pounds from  Jesus College  the whole was laid out in the purchase of a portion of the waste lands in the parish of  Kilken  An act had been passed in the year for the purpose of inclosing the common dividing it among the freeholders and selling certain portions to defray the expences of the act c c c One part was bought with the above sums and settled on the minister of  Holywell  and his successors in addition to their income and say the activity of the present vicar the ground has already been inclosed drained ploughed and sown The other support of the vicars is the antient one  oblationes altaris  among which are reckoned the offerings  at burials for the pious use of the priest and the good estate of the soul of the deceased  See  Kennet's Parochial Antiquities Glossary  Those of  Holywell  parish amount  communibus annis  to eighty pounds  THE vicarage house about the middle of this century became so ruinous as to be uninhabitable In a few years it was rebuilt by the piety of two brothers  Thomas  and  John Barker  of  Brynmadyn  agents to the great smeltingcompany at  Gadlys  who bequeathed to the vicar of  Holywell    l  for the purpose of building a new glebe house at  Holywell  for him and his successors on the same spot as that on which the old one stood It was finished in the year and with the adjacent premises has been considerably improved by the present vicar the Reverend  John Lloyd  and made a most comfortable residence  NOT far distant at the very foot of the hill above the well  CHURCH  stands the parish church placed in that inconvenient situation out of respect to the guardian saint It has only one bell and that not to be heard at any distance so that the congregation is assembled by a walking steeple a man with a small bell who sounds the notice through every street  THE present church was rebuilt in on the site of the old and of the same length and breadth  viz  the length sixtyeight feet the breadth fiftysix It is difficult to ascertain the antient architecture of this church Near the entrance at the westend is a doorway with an obtuse  gothic  arch The pillars plain themselves and with plain capitals which support the gallery on each side of the nave are original and by the specimens given by Dr  Ducarel  in his  Norman Antiquities  tab xiii appear to have  been in use among the  Saxons  and the  Normans  The arches which might have confirmed my suspicion that the church was built in the  Norman  reign are taken away but the style continued till about the year The church has a nave and two ailes over which are two handsome galleries and the whole is supposed to contain three thousand people It is plain neat and calculated for use  SHOULD it be ever thought necessary to commemorate the repair of the church by an inscription I would venture to recommend the energetic lines inscribed on a similar occasion on a church at  Bristol  adapting the date and third line to the circumstances of that of  Holywell  Haec compta DEI domus  modo collapsura  Jam  quatu  r  novis columnis  suffulta et decorata  Stabilimen et ornamentum  recepit A D  Firmiùs stabiliatur precibus  sacramentis evangelis  et puritate morum  Clariùs ornetur quotidiano  coetu Christianorum  UNDER the chancel are the vaults of the  Mostyns  of  Trelacre  the  Pennants  of  Bagillt  and the  Pantons  of  Bagillt  The late  Edward Pennant  esquire on the purchase made by me of part of his estate promised to me his share of these  eternae domus  He died and the posthumous gift was in the handsomest manner  transferred to me by  Roger Barnston  esquire who afterwards possessed the remainder of his fortunes  IN the chancel is a neat  caenotoph  in memory of  Mary  MONUMENTS  mother to the late  Edward Pennant  esquire The inscription does this lady no more than justice  She was prudent pious and charitable in the midst of misfortunes shewed a great example of meekness and humility of patience and resignation to the will of GOD  With the best and most affectionate intent to improve the affairs of her son she engaged in a partnership with a smeltingcompany in the neighborhood The company failed and the creditors in an unrelenting manner pursued the good lady till she was obliged to take shelter in the isle of  Man  where she died on the th of  February  aged forty and was interred in the church at  Douglas  ON the wall of the south aile is a small monument in memory of the Reverend  Robert Edwards  a younger son of  Brynford  rector of  Halkin  who died  May  th Above the inscription are the arms of the house  viz  field vert a cheveron between three wolves heads argent erased with the lion the arms of  Tudor Trevor  empaled The first denotes the descent of the family of  Brynford  from  Ririd Vlaidd  lord of  Penllyn  c killed in battle at the latter end of the reign of  Henry  II  ON the wall at the end of the same aile is a flat stone with twelve quarterings all faithfully copied from those over the chimneypiece in the diningparlor at  Mostyn  This belonged  to the  Mostyns  of  Calcoed  who by virtue of their descent of which more in another place have a right to the first coat The rest appertain only to Sir  Roger Mostyn  especially those of  Edwyn  gained by the marriage of  Jevan  with the heiress of  Mostyn  those of  Gloddaeth  gained by the heiress of  Gloddaeth  and those of  Tregarnedd  gained by the heiress of  Ednefydd Vychan  to each of which none could have a right but the  Mostyns  of  Mostyn  and their heirs On one side is a shield argent with four bars azure in the first three shieldrakes in the second and third two and in the fourth one these evidently variations of the coat see p Beneath is  Hodie mi cras tibi  On the other side beneath the arms of  Philip Phycdan  is  Virtus semper vivit  THE same errors reign in the arms of  Thomas Mostyn  of  Stokyn  They are almost the same with the preceding the date is I shall not repeat here what I have said at p of the possessors of  Stokyn  ON a pillar in the north aile are the very same arms over the seat of the  Williams  's of  Trellynian  with this motto  H XPE M  Labe meâ morior sanguine vivo tuo  THE arms of  Trellynian  are those of  Idnerth  lord of  Maes  rook  a boar's head in chief on the arms of  Edwyn  lord of  Tegengl  Probably the pillar and the seat had been transferred to the  Williams  's by some descendant from the house of  Tudor Trevor  perhaps a  Mostyn  of  HenBlâs  in  Brynford  now the property of Sir  Roger Mostyn  A FOURTH flat stone smaller than the preceding is placed in the wall of the north aile on it is inscribed the following epitaph  Resurrectio mea XTUS  Hic jacet corpus  Johannis Pennant  de  Holywell  Arn  ge  que obiit  xxx die  Augusti    JOHN PENNANT was second in descent from  Nicholas Pennant  last abbot of  Basingwerk  and was married to  Margaret  daughter of  Hugh Mostyn  younger son of  Pyers Mostyn  of  Trelacre  His arms are the three shieldrakes quarterly with those of Sir  Robert Pounderling  constable of  Desert  castle and of Sir  Griffith Llwyd  mentioned before at p He was greatgrandfather to  Mary Pennant  who conveyed into our house the  Holywell  and  Merton Abbot  estates by her marriage with  David Pennant  of  Bychton  IN rebuilding the church was found the headless figure of a priest in his sacerdotal habit and with a chalice in his hand He is supposed to have been  Thomas  second son of  Thomas ap David  abbot of  Basingwerk  whom I find in the  Bagillt  pedegree to have been vicar of  Holywell  THE steeple is plain and square very strongly built but without any mark to denote the time of its being built  THE churchyard is the worst in the whole diocese  CHURCHYARD  A small part is a gentle slope but the greater almost precipitous so that after any continuance of wet weather a fall may happen productive of the most indecent and horrible spectacles  THE number of inhabitants in this parish may be from to There are about houses in the whole parish  NUMBER OF PEOPLE  of  which upwards of are in the town  Greenfield  contains about  houses This is the township which has received the greatest increase by reason of the sudden and vast accession of inhabitants by reason of the manufactures which settled here nearly at the same time In these evil days about twenty of the houses are empty  INCREASE  THE increase of inhabitants may be collected from the following abstract from the  Holywell  registers Let it be observed that the number allowed to each house is greater than common from the consideration that in manufacturing places the number of poor employed in them are crowded into far less space than in any other towns  Year                    Baptisms                    Burials                  IN bishop  Tanner  's MS notes on the diocese of St  Asaph  presented to me by my respected friend the late Reverend Doctor  William Wynne  I find that in the year the number of families was of which were recusants  POORS RATES  IN respect to the poors rate I have a very curious memorandum extracted out of the old vestrybook of the parish by Mr  Samuel Small  who with his usual friendship communicated it to me and every thing else which he thought would promote my design  IN    May  Vestry ordered the church and poors ley to be assessed separately and that £ be raised for the church and £ for the poor both for the year  till then the leys  were promiscuous and denominated a church rate That book began in and ended in  ANOTHER memorandum  June  Ordered  IN  that church and poors leys be assessed separately and that £ be raised for the church and £ for the poor both for  IN the present year the rates  IN  equalized according to the actual rents amount to fifteen hundred pounds  IN this parish are three clubs or friendly societies  CLUBS OR FRIENDLY SOCIETIES  instituted on the same plan as those in  Whiteford  parish see p The first or the Old Club was formed on  March  th so that it is prior to our's by fifteen years It consists at present of members  CLUB the second consists of members and was formed  January  th  CLUB the third is composed of members and commenced on  January  st Each of these clubs have their rules but so similar to those of  Whiteford  parish that I shall not repeat them I shall only remark  ne quid detrimenti ecclesia capiat  that there is an article which excludes every one who is not of the true church of  England  by law established unless with the approbation of the majority  THE UNION CLUB was established in  April    UNION CLUB  It is composed of fortytwo members in general the most respectable inhabitants of the parish untainted with despotic or jacobinical principles Every  Christmas  they shew exemplary charity to their poor neighbors and under their influence above  l  was raised the late season of scarcity and distributed among the objects most  worthy of relief My son and I are proud of being members of this society as well as all the preceding  OLD  C    LET me here mention from the principle  Haec olim me  nisse  ava  is  a society long extinct which consisted of the gentlemen of the neighborhood and the most respectable men of business tradesmen or mine adventurers who met during summer once a week to dine at the house of  Bryn Celyn  and after dinner descended to the bowlinggreen just beneath to amuse themselves with the innocent recreation Adjoining in a room of retreat in the intervals of play the persons out took their pipe and ale or perhaps a small bowl of punch for in those plain days wine was seldom called for unless by the few with whom other liquors might disagree  In these days alas our native liquor is banished from most tables  Ah redeant SATURNIA regna    IN the town are three places of worship besides the church two for the  Roman Catholics  and one for dissenters The last was built on my ground by lease dated  April  and is maintained by voluntary contributions Of the former one supports a secular or parish priest The other a gentleman of the late order of Jesuits Both of their cures are endowed with lands vested in trustees Each of their houses had been a species of hotel probably designed for the reception of pilgrims of better rank One was called the  Crosskeys  the other the  Star  I remember at one or other of them  Edward  duke of  Norfolk  and other visitants of distinction  BRYN Y CASTELL  ABOVE the church is a hill called  Bryn y Castell  narrow and very steep on the sides projecting at the end over the little valley  On this might have stood the castle of  Treffynnon  or St  Wenefrede  built by  Randle  III earl of  Chester  in the year  Powel    There are not at present any vestiges left  IT is singular that no mention is made in the  DoomsdayBook  of either chapel church or well yet townships now of less note are named such as  Brunford Caldecote  and others Notwithstanding bishop  Fleetwood  's opinion I think the legend of St  Wenefrede  was known previous to that survey for the very name of  Holywell  is  Saxon  probably bestowed on it before the Conquest on account of the imputed sanctity of the well  THE spring is certainly one of the finest in these kingdoms and by the two different trials and calculations lately made for my information is found to fling out about twentyone tons of water in a minute It never freezes In respect to the equality of the water in droughts or after the greatest rains I find I must place it among the vulgar errors From the authority of Mr  Christopher Smalley  and other respectable manufacturers on the stream I discover that the variation is extremely great and that there is a decrease in summer of more than onethird and in great droughts of still more and after violent rains the increase is in like proportion some even say it is onehalf As long as I remember the fountain after heavy falls of wet became of a wheyey color This is increased to a great degree grows more turbid and even deposits a mud upon the stones  THE town was also very inconsiderable till the beginning of this century the houses few and those for the most part  that  the streets unpaved and the place destitute of a market The flourishing mines that for some time were discovered  made a great change in the appearance and introduced the effects of wealth The effects of the manufacto  make less appearance in the town than in the valley beneath  from the well to the seaside is a continued succession of  s  THE monks of  Basingwerk  obtained for it the grant of a  a market The first has been dropt beyond the memory of  The market was also lost till it was renewed by letter  ent dated  Jan  th granted to Sir  John Eger  et The patent also contains a grant of three fairs  viz  on the d of  April  the  Tuesday  in  Easter  week and the d of  er  The market has been the most flourishing in  North Wales  but the fairs never could be established  THE market is the best in the county for butcher's meat That for corn is now much reduced by reason of the greater farmers or the badgers or purchasers for exportation lessening the great stock which used to supply the markets at reasonable rates Every great farmer seems now to have taken the early part of his education in ChangeAlley and is as expert in prices of corn as any academy of that noted place is in those of stocks That there never can be a deficiency for the use of the natives of  Flintshire  either from their own lands or the vale of  Clwyd  is evident from the following table of exportation from  September  to  August  th communicated to me by the friendship of the gentlemen of the customhouse in  Chester  from which appear the following truths     Wheat Qrs B  Wheat Flour Q  B  Rye Qrs B  Barley Qrs B  Malt Qrs B  Oats Qrs B  Oatmeal Qrs B  Beans Q  s B  Bean Flour Qrs B

also  Fulibrock  The  Grange  still remains a farmhouse in a most ruinous condition It is the property of Sir  Pyers Mostyn  but formerly belonged to the abby of  Basingwerk  having been granted to

Dentir  a field belonging to Sir  Pyers  on the north side of a small dingle opening into the road opposite to the great cotton factory Under the pilotage of the honest  Thomas Edwards  agent to the mine we entered the mouth lighted by candles stuck on each side of our vessel The first forty yards of our way was arched with stone and so low as to oblige us to stoop When the arch ceased the roof was the natural rock of that species called  shale    The height begins now to be six feet the breadth four the depth of the water included in the height is two and a half After passing in the shaley stratum about two hundred and twentysix yards we find it is succeeded  by that of  ch  rt  C    at which spot the level enters my ground in the field called  Coed Cae porfa  There the height to the surface is eighteen yards Several shafts have been sunk for air between this place and the mouth of the level In a field of mine called  C  dlas  r  was early discovered at the depth of thirtyone yards a strong string of ore which raised the hopes of the adventurers to the highest degree and the mineral stock rose in proportion But alas in a little time both spirits and stock fell for the promising prospect suddenly vanished an accident too frequent with miners to occasion surprize The chert continues to a little beyond the turnpikeroad when we again enter the land of Sir  Pyers Mostyn  in a field called  Brocknallt  where it stops Hitherto the level has preserved a strait course  LIME STONE  but in this field where the limestone stratum begins and is continued to the end of the present working above five hundred yards it takes a bend parallel to the road and so continues as far as  Brocknalltpella  and then makes another curvature and near a small but pretty cave crosses obliquely the turnpikeroad  A CAVE  The cave is furnished with a table and benches at which the visitants never fail experiencing the hospitality of their worthy conductor Out of this cave is a passage or sump or short shaft sunk for the purpose both of searching for ore and also for conveying of air which began to be wanted into the level This sump communicates with several others till it reaches a shaft The action of the air is various sometimes it descends through the shaft  VE  TILATOR  at other times rushes up the mouth of the level but in each case passes into the mouth of a square wooden conductor which enters the lower part of the sump and is continued on one side of the level almost to the end of the present working  IN proceeding farther we were alarmed with the awful sound of a cataract On arriving at the spot from whence it issued the noise seemed to have derived its greatest force from the confined arch of the level  CASCADE  for we discovered it to proceed from a small but elegant cascade which in our sight tumbled down a small hollow and served to augment the water of the level which was also increased by several strong springs rising from the sides and bottom with strong ebullitions  OTHER SUBTERRANEOUS WATERS  Similar noises are said to have been heard in  Coetiau'r Odyn  It is possible that this subterraneous water may be one of the feeds of St  Wenefrede  's well as the field is nearly in a descending line with it I have also heard on good authority of another large stream of water running through a great subterraneous cavern in working  Portaway  mine in  Pantasa  in the parish of  Whiteford  but its discharge has never been yet discoveredBut to return After passing this fall we reached the end of our voyage at the length of yards from the mouth and at the place where two miners were pursuing the working of the level and had got within ten yards of the shaft in which the miners are working in the rich vein beneath the field called  Coed Cae Plwm  or the wood or field of lead The height from the sole of the level to the surface at this place is ninetythree yards and a half the depth of the shaft which is now so flattering to our hopes is fifty yards so that there are fortythree yards and a half from its sole to that of the level which all the way is found to be filled with ore  BUT we have more than one  string  to our bow  OTHER  Coetiau'r Odyn  vein runs entirely from  Coe  iaumaur  fields through my ground as does  Maes Whiteford  giving Mr  Jones  of  Wepre  a small  chance in our mineral lottery Then comes  True Blue  which is shared between Sir  yers Mostyn  and myself and the once rich vein of  Brocknallt  is entirely his All these run north and south and have in general been very productive but especially those belonging to the house of  Tre  a  re  CONTINUANCE OF  LET me observe that in the depth of the level we saw the descending course of all these veins excepting  Coe  dyn  some of them which were tried at that depth proved bar  How far lower the veins descended may probably ever remai  cret unless some bold adventures should have the spirit to attempt a level from the marsh which we at p proved to have from the we  a fail of  feet  FERTILE TRAC    THE whole tract below the east side of this road is a most fertile and well cultivated bottom sloping on each side Its rural oeconomy may vie in excellen  e with the most boasted of our island The prospect is charming of the whole length of the  Chester  channel bounded on the opposite by  Wiral  and a distant view of part of  Lancashire  FROM the other side of the road the ground rises steeply on the summit is a tract of inclosed land backed by the mountain or common  PENYBAL ROAD  I RETURN into the town and at the end of  Whitefordstreet  ascend the steep road called  PenyBal  of very laborious ascent I remember it the only coach approach on this side The present fine road then with great propriety called  Holloway  was too narrow for any carriage beyond the then wretched carts of the country I well remember that whenever our family wanted to visit  Holywell  it was obliged to be dragged up to  Penyforddwaen  to cross the mountain and with locked wheel and with great peril go down the almost precipitous way  FROM the summit of  Pen yBal  to the west  CALCOLD  is a narrow tract of common A little beyond in a small wood stands  Calcot  or  Calcoed  in the township of the same name In the  Doomsd  y Book  it is called  Caldecote  and is there united with  Meretone  and  rtia parte de W  dford  The founder of this house was  Henry Moston  doctor of civil law second son of  Pyers Moston  of  Trelacre  He purchased  Ca  lcot  as it was then spelt of  George  and  Thomas Manley  of  Chester  in the year for the sum of  l  After four generations the succession ended in the male line in  Samuel Mostyn  esquire who died  May  th aged and was buried at  Northop  on the th who settled his estate on his nephew Mr  John Ellis  who assumed the surname of  Mostyn  ON the mountain to the east of the common way to  Calcoed  NAIDYMARCH  are two stones about three feet high and about twentytwo feet distant from each other They are called  NaidyMarch  or the horse's leap from a vulgar notion of the derivation of the name They are of the very antient  British  origin and probably the place of interment of some hero whose body was deposited between stone and stone The distance might be intended to give an idea of his mighty size as  Alexander  is supposed on his return out of  India  to have buried various suits of armor of gigantic dimensions to impose on future times an exalted notion of the troops he had led to this distant country  I DESCEND again into  Holywell  HALKIN AND BRYNFORD ROADS  and at the south end of the  High Street  turn to the right up the road which leads to  Halkin  and  Brynford  the latter branches from that to  Halkin  on the right  Above the road is the old house of  Brynford  FORD HOUSE  at present the property of  Richard Garnons  esquire It had been that of the  Edwards  's Their descent is given at p I remember it inhabited by  Thomas Edwards  esquire a most respectable old gentleman blind with age of great charity and benevolence and who most grateful to Providence increased his charities in proportion to the increase of his abilities in obedience to the direction of Heaven to observe its frequent injunctions to the performance of that virtue  PENYBRYN MINE  OPPOSITE to the house on the other side of the road was formerly a profitable leadmine called  Pen y Bryn  belonging to lord  Kilmorey  REFRACTING SPAR  It was remarkable for the quantity of refracting spar  spatum Islandicum  of great purity and trasparency and often elegantly infected with marcasite finely disposed in lines  THIS road ends on the mountain on the borders of  Skyviog  parish the boundary of  Holywell  parish on this side  PISTILL  I RETURN to the turnpike road and continuing my way pass on the right by  Pistill  a neat small house the property of  Peter Parry  esquire of  Twissog  in the county of  Denbigh  IN order to proceed towards the rich mineral country I am entering on I shall continue the enumeration of veins from  C  etiau'r Odyn  see p  MEI  AND OTHER MINES  THE next to that eastward is  Caleb Bell  a north and south vein which is traced from the east side of  PenyBal  descends from the mountain towards the late  John Denman  's but as yet has not been traced to the road This has in old times been very rich in several places  THE old vein or  Pant Ithel  is another rich vein which first  appeared in  Pantasa  and yielded great quantities of ore and calamine From thence crosses  Butler's fields  and  PenyBal  and then to  Coetia fawr  from thence to  Pant Ithel  where it descends near  ynford  house and crosses the road into  Highgate  tenement the property of Mr  Williams  of  Trelunnian  It then enters into my tenement called  Meilwr  and was the first place in which ore was found in the level the lease of which was granted by my father on  December  the th  THE next is the  Highgate  vein which about  Pistill  had branched into many strings As they advance from  Pistill  eastward they enter  Highgate  tenement and become very productive both in Mrs  Williams  's land and also my own which for many years poured on me in great abundance its mineral wealth I never considered this species of riches but of the most precarious nature liable instantly to fail I therefore secured them on the best of tenures and purchased with them the moiety of the  BagilltHall  estate which has turned out to me uncommonly fortunate I also was enabled by another part to improve my house at  Downing  to what it now is  EVERY thing has its end The vein or veins at length grew poorer A great fireengine was erected a few years ago in hopes of clearing the water and getting at the ore which was supposed to have been left in the soles  THE level begins at the bottom of the north side of  Nanthillbrwc  and runs southwest How uncertain is mineral knowlege even among the most knowing The object of the lessees was the working up to a certain rich vein named the  hard shaft  in the lands belonging to  Brynfordd  An object that never  yet has been obtained But in pursuit of that object they most unexpectedly met with the veins which produced so much wealth to Mr  Williams  and myself Perhaps I fall short in my estimate if I say that to lessors and lessees the total amount must have exceeded a hundred thousand pounds  THE next vein to the  highgate  is a string within five yards of the  high gate  which his been very productive Into the field called  Coetia Yscubor  the  hard shaft  vein is expected to enter and cross the whole breadth into the ground of  Pen y pylle  And at the very corner of the same field another vein crosses into the same land and has been tolerably rich  I NOW quit my mineral territories in this part of the country and cross over the road to  Pen y pylle  the seat of  Hugh Humphreys  esquire descended from  Edwyn  prince of  Tegengl  That gentleman has had large share of the mineral wealth The vein  Rest y cegin  passes under his very house and garden The minehillocks fill the land but by his judicious walks and plantations which now cover them he has turned them into beauties The vein continues to his grounds below his house and may probably be a source of new wealth  THE  Lucky Venture  is the last vein I can mention in this parish which ranges from the mountain and crosses the road into a corner of a field of Mr  Humphreys  and immediately from thence into the land belonging to  Edward Jones  esquire of  Wepre  in which abundance of ore has been got Much has also been got in the very road in a pit sunk by earl  Grosvenor  a privilege clamed by his lordship in virtue of his great mineral grant  THIS township ends at about a mile distance from  Pen y pylle  where it is separated by  Rh  d    a little  ll from the parish of  Halkin  I RETURN again into the town  GADLYS ROAD  and after crossing the east end of the  High Street  take the road leading toward  Gadlys  On the right I see a trifling monument of my respect to a town which has for a long series of years shewn every mark of esteem for the landlord of many and the friend of all In an adjacent field of mine called  Roft T  b  was a valuable spring which running to waste occasioned a great loss of time to rich and poor in procuring water I by the assistance of Mr  Denbavand  caused in the year a pillar to be erected into which the water was collected and raised to a height convenient to be received into vessels placed there to supply with ease and expedition the wants of the inhabitants  AT the bottom of the descent from  Holywell  is a beautiful dingle named  Nanthilbrwe  which winds on the right to  Meilwr  tenement and on the left quite to the marsh the greater part of the way ornamented with hanging woods On crossing a bridge near a large mill the property of  Paul Panton  esquire  BAGILLT TOWNSHIP  enter the township of  Bagillt  and in less than half a mile pass by the house of that worthy friend of mine Our intimacy began in early youth  HOUSE THE PAN    and has been ever since retained With joy I see his eldest son rising with progressive goodness and rare abilities I see with pleasure my eldest son with true judgment cultivating with him a friendship May it continue through a long life of human felicity pleasant to themselves and useful to their neighbors and country  TO Mr  Panton  senior I hold myself greatly obliged for the account of his family maternal and paternal  THE GRIFFITH O  BAGILLT  THE house and estate of  Bagillt  was conveyed into Mr  Panton  's family by the marriage of his father with  Mary  daughter of  Edward Griffiths  esquire descended from the  Griffiths  of  Caerwishall  who derived themselves from  Ednowen Bendew  one of the fifteen tribes of  North Wales  His ancestors had long been settled at this place and have as antient deeds to shew for their lands as any in  Wales  as will appear by the following will  CU  IOU  WILL  IN the name

till they come to lawful age and all this at the oversight of my lord abbot  THE close distinguished in this will by the name of  Gwern Onnen  still retains the name and runs from  Roft Tob  towards the woods that lead to  Meilwr  THE licence for Mr  Panton  's greatgrandfather's marriage by his mother's side in  Cromwell  's time is a curiosity worthy of the reader's perusal I think that the same form is introduced into  France  since the abolition of religion in that kingdom It probably was taken from the model left by our fanatical rulers in the last century I have another of a similar marriage in our family attested by  Evans  a justice in  Northop  parish  KNOW all men that upon the eleventh day of  February  CU    in the year of our Lord God one thousand six hundred and  fiftyfive  Richard Griffith  sonne and heire app  ̄nt of  John C  ff    late of  Bagilt  in the county of  lint  esq  r  deceased and  Martha Pennant  the daughter of  Edward Pennant  esq  r  of  Bagillt  aforesaid came before me  Ralf Hughes  esq  •  one of the justices of the peace of the county of  int  and desired to be joyned together in matrimony and being sufficiently satisfied that the said intended marriage was published on three several Lords dayes at the tyme of morning exercise within the parish church of  Holywell  within which parish the said parties reside and that noe  son gaynesayed or  tended any cause why the said parties might not be joyned togeather in matrimonie both of them being of full age and discretion and the parents of both parties consenting thereuntoand after both parties had pronounced before me in the presence of divers credible witnesses the words of solemnization mentioned in an act of parliament intitled an act touching marriages and dated the xx  day of  August    I did pronounce and declare the said  Richard Griffith  and  Martha Pennant  to be lawful husband and wife In witness whereof I have hereunto put my hand and sale the day and yeare first above written  RA HUGHES  L S  Witnesses hereunto  Thomas Griffith  Roger Jones  John Mostyn  THE antient smeltinghouse of  Gadlys  stood a full mile distant from this house about a mile distant from the shore and on the land of  Robert Hughes  esquire of  Halkin  The lease expired  in and the works were pulled entirely down after standing the term of the agreement which was fortyfour years  THE respectable company long known by the name of the  Governor and Company for smelting down Lead with Pit Coale and Sea Coale  by the royal charter granted in the th of  William  and  Mary  began business in this county about the year They flourished with a most fair reputation for a great number of years till their decline either through want of ore or other inevitable causes induced them to remove their antient furnaces to some works built by the late Messrs  Smedley  on the bank above  Bagillt  Those they purchased and continued smelting under the direction of their agent Mr  William Smith  To whom I am much indebted for information respecting the  Gadly  company  till they sold them to Messrs  Griffith  and  Astet  of  London  This company was often called the  Quakers Company  from the number of persons of that mild persuasion being of it  DURING the prosperity of the works which was very long they produced vast quantities of lead and bullion of the latter they extracted from the lead between the year and not less than ounces Queen  Anne  and her successor commanded that all specie coined from the silver should be struck on the reverse with the plume of feathers as a mark of its having been the production of the principality  Leake on Coin      James  I gave the same directions respecting the coin made from the silver of the mines worked by Sir  Hugh Middleton  in  Cardiganshire  and in  Charles  I caused the same marks of  Welsh  silver to be placed on the coins of the mint at  Aberystwith  obtained  from the mines of the same county  Leake on Coins    Other coins from the company's works were called  quakers money  from the cause above assigned In an antient map of  Denbighshire  and  Flintshire  by  W Williams  published in is an engraving of a crown with the feathers the  insignia  of  Wales  and also another of the seal of the corporation with its crest and arms The supporters are two miners and the motto the apt one  Spectatur in igne  And above them is a view of the works faithfully given as they appeared before they were reduced to a single chimney  THE company were for a long series of years the greatest mineadventurers in  North Wales  and had very considerable mines in every part of  Flintshire  The company disposed of their remaining property in the county and totally withdrew from it at  Michaelma    but still they carry on very extensive mines and smeltingworks in  Cumberland  and  Northumberland  under the commissioners of  Greenwich  hospital on the forfeited estates of the earl of  Derwentwater  GADLYS takes its name from the  Welsh Câd  an army and  Llys  signifying the royal head quarter or palace Near the works stood a large mount on which might have been a castelet the residence of some of our princes  BETWEEN this place and  Pentre Bagillt  is another eminence of antient celebrity  Bryn Dychwelwch  so named from  Bryn a hill  and  Dychwelwch return  being traditionally said to have been the place from which  Henry  II gave his order for retreat when he was engaged with the  Welsh  in with his whole army in  Coleshill  in the same difficulties as he had just  before experienced in the depth of  Coed Eulo  BATTLE OF COLESHILL  In this action his forces were again defeated and  Eustace Fitz John  a baron first in rank wealth and abilities among the  English  and  Robert de Courci  another great baron with numbers of others were slain  Henry de Essex  hereditary standardbearer and a man of approved valor was seized with a panic and flinging down the standard cried out that the king was killed The route would have been general if the king had not valiantly rallied his forces and repulsed the  Welsh  but in the end he thought it prudent to withdraw his army and encamp in a secure station He afterwards attempted by decamping from the shore and endeavoring to get into the interior part of the country to cut off  Owen  's retreat into the mountains  See  Powel  p  But the wise prince penetrating into his views retired to a plain near  St Asaph  still called  Cîl Owen  or  Owen's Retreat  and from thence to a strong post named  BrynyPin  defended by great ramparts and ditches This camp lies in the parish of St  George  on a lofty rock above the church and is now called  Pen y Pare  I RETURN from this length of road to the skirts of the town of  Holywell  and enter the road to  Wallwen  ROAD TO FLINT  on the borders of the marsh a branch of the  Flint  turnpike district tacked to it by act of parlement in which had been obtained in that sessions for enlarging the term and powers of the  Mostyn  district and particularly adding this road under the description of  from  Wallwen  to the then dwellinghouse of  Edward Parry  This act will not terminate till After a very short space pass by a noble maltkilo and granary the property of Mr  Richard Sankey  MALT KILN  who more than once gave a very seasonable relief to the country  in the late time of scarcity by large importations of barley and that with very small profit to himself  E  Would not repositories of grain established and filled by parlementary sanction be stronger prevertatives of that evil than any other I would have no part of our wastes lie uncultivated Our wastes have very properly the synonym of  commons  for rich and poor bordering on them have in them proportionate rights  The legislature at this very time seems to have this subject in consideration much care and attention must be paid to it The poor may by various means be tempted to sell their new acquisitions There will always be  harpies  at hand to take advantage of distress by which means every ease to the parishes will be defeated Those little possessions should if possible be entailed on the parish or allotted as alleviations of parochial taxes those growing evils in a manner the wisdom of the legislature may contrive  If the poor man is to lose his benefit of feeding a few geese or a few sheep ought he not to have recompence by the  greniers d'abondance  granaries of plenty so useful to  France  before the miseries in which rich and poor have been involved by the chime  as of bramsick politicians If our wastes are to be generally inclosed ought not the produce to be safely lodged in proper houses of reception and from the boasted plenty which is to ensue be ready by the resource at hand to chase away the  daemon  rapacity which has had too great a power over the dealers in the subsistence of the land All that human wit could invent should be practised to prevent their eluding the attempt to reduce grain to a price which might afford an honest profit to the farmer and yet enable him to supply the poor laborer at a rate which might give him power not only to feed his family but to cloath them with decent rayment an article coessential to their comfort and to their health  AS a house of industry is now in contemplation by the parish of  Holywell  is there not a possibility of allotting certain portions of the waste lands for sale to raise a fund to carry on the work or to give in mortgage to such persons who may be willing to advance money for so salutary a purpose  THE town of  Shrewsbury  and I may say of every manufacturing county have succeeded to admiration in their attempts and should be examples to us This neighborhood is now filled with men of business capable of the conduct of such works besides the cotton and twist company have it in their power to expend annually above £ in the town in picking the cotton but from the dislike of the poor to that employ are obliged to send the materials to distant places see p whereby the town and neighborhood lose the expenditure of that great sum among them We squires are less qualified for operations which require vigor and activity but we can contribute countenance and power equally essential to the support of the design I know the poor will be averse to it at first but when they recollect how long they had starved under the careless care of overseers and that they will be placed under the immediate attention of visitors consisting of their neighbors and that they will not be removed beyond the reach of their friends and relations whom they may see at proper times I trust they will be satisfied To banish the poor from the possibility of the occasional comfort of their dearest relatives would be unspeakable cruelty I therefore must ever condemn a county house of industry in which that essential consolation is made difficult or impossible to the inmates from distant parts  VITRIOLWORKS  ON gaining the summit of this road appears a vitriolwork the property of Mr  Donbavand  placed under the care of Mr  John Jones  of  Holywell  an able chymist His operations are directed to three articles blue vitriol or vitriol of copper which is made by dissolving copper in oil of vitriol or acid of sulphur After the solution has taken place the produce is dissolved in boiling water evaporated down to a given weight and put in coolers to evaporate  THE use of this species of vitriol is in dying cottons of a green or olive color and hats and woollen cloths black and also for making green verditer for painting in oil or watercolors  VERDITER  by precipitation with whiting  SUGAR OF LEAD  THE last article is sugar of lead or  saccharum saturni  which is lead dissolved in distilled vinegar When the vinegar is saturated with the lead it is boiled down to a given weight and like the blue vitriol is put in coolers to crystallize For the purpose of making the wort for the vinegar twelve hundred hobbets of barley or malt had been employed in a single year but in the late season of scarcity the proprietor totally desisted from this branch of business  SUGAR of lead is used in the cotton printing business for fixing the colors in the stuff dyed or printed Such I believe to be the sole application of it from these works but from others nearer to the capital I fear a most criminal one is frequently in practice for it is a most dangerous poison I mean that of using it in the refining of white wines or in restoring the sweetness to such which are grown sour for this drug is the sweetest of all sweet things It occasions to the drinkers of wines thus restored  or rather thus endowed with the powers of poison numbers of maladies they cannot account for such as colics obstinate costiveness and paralytic affections of the limbs Finally we may add death itself The fatal dinner at  Salt Hill  on  March  th which ended in the destruction of several gentlemen supposed to have been caused by wine impregnated with this fatal drug has been much talked of I believe that not to have been the case The gentlemen did not sicken till after several days One Mr  Pote  who had drank as the rest did never was infected It happened that he walked in the garden during the time a most miserable object a pauper had been examined from whom the pestilential  miasmata  of a fever probably of the nature of the jailfever had diffused themselves among the company present for all except Mr  Pote  sickened  Gent Mag  p  In this instance the vintners may be cleared but since it is probable that numbers of people fall victims to their art I wish legislature would frame a law to condemn them not to the halter but to the more apt punishment of swallowing a competent draught of their own  Stygian  liquor  Nec lex est justior ulla  Bishop  Watson  iii says that in  Germany  such adulteration is punished with death In  Henry  VIII's time a cook was boiled to death I hope in his own kettle for poisoning a number of poor at  Lambeth  with the broth allotted by a pious prelate for their support  I MUST not forget that in  October  last Mr  Hugh Roberts  RIBBON WEAVERS  of  Little Moorfields  established on my ground opposite to the vitriolworks a colony of ribbonweavers Sixteen looms are already employed and others continually expected  THE    FROM the summit to the shore is a most steep descent About a quarter of a mile lower on the right stands the house of  BagilltHall  erroneously so named it not being possessed of any m  nerial rights nor does it stand even in the township of  Bagillt  the whole road from the town of  Holywell  being in the township of that name divided from the former by the bottom of the dingle which we crossed by Mr  Panton  's mill  THE house was large had a great and handsome hall and a good parlor the last wainscotted with good oak much carved about the chimney The rest of the house consisted of a number of rooms irregularly disposed Near it stood as usual with our old seats a summerhouse  THIS place is beautifully situated the grounds slope towards the sea and command a fine view of the  Chester  channel and as far as  Beeston  castle and its adjacent hills  A FEW years ago I was obliged to pull down great part of the building It was very old and going fast to ruin and the repairs would have been uselessly expensive for the thick smoke of a great smeltingmill for lead and of a great calcininghouse for calamine just beneath must have ever deterred my descendants from making it their residence  FOUNDER OF THE FAMILY  THE founder of the family was  Thomas  abbot of  Basingwerk  and second son to  David ap Tudor  of  Bychton  by  Anne  daughter of  John Done  of  Utkinton  in the county of  Chester  Our abbot was living in the year in the reign of  Edward  IV and in those of  Edward  V and  Richard  III The reader will excuse I hope the repetition of the few words in which I mentioned  HALL  that celebrated  churchman  who quitting his profession became what the lawyers call a  monk deraigne  and married  Angharad  daughter of  Guillim ap Gryffydd ap Guillim  of the great house of  Penrhyn  in the county of  Caernarvon  By this lady he had four sons  Edward  the eldest succeeded to his fortunes in the parish of  Holywell Thomas  the second became vicar of  Holywell  and  Nicholas  the third succeeded to the abbotship of  Basingwerk  Fourth in descent from him was  John  who acquired the estate of  Merton  in the parish of  Whiteford  by his marriage with  Mary  daughter and heir of  Thomas ap Thomas ap Edward  of that house Finally by the marriage of his only daughter  Catharine  with  David Pennant  of  Bychton  we not only acquired the  Merton  estate but all the possessions in  Holywell  belonging to abbot  Nicholas  LET me not forget that  Nicholas  had also two sisters one named  Agnes  wife of  John Griffith ap Twna  the other  Margaret  wife of  Gruff Lloyd ap John of Griffith ap David  THE house of  Bagillt  was probably built by  Henry  second in descent from the abbot for he is styled in the pedegree  of  Holywell  and  Bagillt  whereas his father  Edward  is designed of  Holywell  only  FROM  David  fifth brother of  Henry  PENNANTS OF H  NDREFIGILLT  sprang the family of the  Pennants  of  Hendre figillt  in the parish of

Pennant  was buried on  September  th The last who is mentioned in the pedegree of the house is  Peter  who married  Barbara  daughter  of  John Eyton  of  Leefwood  and was cotemporary with  David Pennant  of  Bychton  who was living in  C  PENYGARTH  THERE were other branches of the house of  Hendrefigillt  one settled at  PenyGarth  in the parish of  Mold  but is now extinct Part of the lands are now in possession of Mr  Thomas Williams  of  Dolevechles  a respectable freeholder in the parish of  Kilken  in right of his greatgrandmother  Mary Pennant  a daughter of  PenyGarth  She was buried at  Kilken September  st As to the house and estate of  Hendrefig  lt  it has long since passed into the family of  Kilken  and is at present possessed by  Mostyn Edwards  esquire  LORD PENRHYN  MY respected but remote kinsman  Richard Pennant  baron  Penrhyn  sprung from this branch of our family He is ninth in descent from the abbot and third from  Gifford Pennant  second son of  Edward Pennant  of  Bagillt  by  Catherine  daughter of  Edward Kynaston  of  Otely  in the county of  Salop  He went to  Jamaica  in the time of  Oliver Cromwel  had a grant of lands there  November  th settled in the parish of  Clarendon  and died in His lordship's property in that island is immense and his addition to it in the county of  Caernarvon  in this his native island is very considerable by his marriage with  Anne Susanna  daughter and heiress of the late general  Warburton  of  Winnington  in  Cheshire  With singular fortune by this match his lordship possesses  Penrhyn  the seat and estate belonging to the family of  Angbarad  his distant ancestress from whom lady  Penrhyn  is by her grandmother also descended All these fortunes they enjoy with dignity and with utility to their numerous tenantry I particularly allude to those about  Penrhyn  where he has made  his vast slatequarries an object of admiration to travellers profitable to himself and the source of opulence to the surrounding country I had not at the publication of my  Welsh Tour  opportunity of informing myself about these important works I therefore give a brief sketch of their history  WHEN his lordship came to possession of his fortunes in part of the island he found great appearance of neglect and poverty among the tenantry the slatequarries one great staple of the country in a very low state and the export of that valuable article did not annually exceed a thousand tons and there were not four carts on his estate and only three in all  NantFrankon  and the roads scarcely passable for a horse By his judicious management a happy reverse took place The carriages have encreased to the present time to rather more than a hundred broadwheel carts and waggons  PORT  Penrhyn  formerly  Abercegid  is now highly improved by quays for the reception of vessels so that those of two hundred tons burden can lie close to them and take in their cargo Vessels of above three hundred tons can enter the port but cannot get close to the quays  BEFORE the country experienced his lordship's improving talents not above a thousand tons have been exported in the year In the export amounted to fifteen thousand In there was every reasonable hope that it would have increased to twenty thousand but the tax on the slates has given it a check though it is expected that the return of peace and a modification of the duty will restore the progress of the trade  THE statequarries are a few miles from the port near the entrance into  Na  tFrankon  From four to five hundred men are employed in them They live in very elegant cottages prettily disposed in groups Here is a butcher and a shoemaker but no corrupting alehouse is permitted His lordship has built a market house so that the workmen need not wander for the necessary provisions Let me not forget that he erected an elegant pavilion called  Ogwen Bank  with a kitchen stables c which lord and lady  Penrhyn  often visit either to examine into this creation of theirs or to amuse their guests  HIS lordship was elected member for  Petersfield  in the first parlement of his present majesty and in vacated his seat to be elected for  Leverpool  He was returned in and again in In that arduous situation his lordship discharged his trust with zeal abilities and fidelity  EDWARD PENNANT the last owner of  Bagillt  and last of the male line lord  Penrhyn  excepted died at  Marseilles  on  March  d  and was there interred In he disposed of to me by sale all the estates in the township of  Holywell  And soon after he retired into  France  he bequeathed the remainder of his fortunes to his cousin  Thomas Cratchley  who dying left them to  Roger Barnston  esquire of  Chester  M  H  S OF    FROM  Bagillthall  I descended into the township of  Bagillt  through the turnpikegate at  Wallwen  Immediately on the left hand in  Holywell  township is a small house and small patrimony the property of the Reverend  Thomas Hughes  a curate of twelve years standing of good morals decent and modest His family  and two other families not remote from him had long possessed respectable freeholds of fifty pounds ayear each  Time and chance happeneth to all men  Our humble curate is far distanced by the other two He remains a drudge in his profession  honestâ pauperie  resulting from fraternal affection in exerting every nerve to support two sisters who rest on him for the poor pittance he can afford to give  AFTER passing the turnpikegate I find myself on the continuance of the turnpikeroad from  Greenfield  to  Flint  The distance from the  Greenfield  gate to  Flint  is only four miles Let me add that within little more than one mile from the fountain of  St Wenefrede  at  Holywell  to the gate just mentioned  Britain  may be challenged to shew on an equal space a similar assemblage of commercial buildings or of capitals employed in erecting and in carrying on their several objects I refer the reader back to p for an account of those upon the  Holywell  stream I resume the chain of commerce from the copperforge the lowest link which reaches to the very road  A LITTLE to the right of the turnpikegate the little rill  Nanthilbrwe  divides the small township of  Whelstone  from that of  Holywell  This tract of which I have the tythes is one of the portions of  Bagillt  township which is very large and subdivided into two others  Bagilltsawr  and  Bagilltfechan  ON the side of the rill stand the works called the  River Bank  established on my land by lease dated  September    RIVER BANK WORKS  granted to Messrs  William Roe  and  Edward Hawkins  These buildings are employed for the double purposes of calcining calamine for the brassworks at  Cheadle  and  Macclesfield  and for  the smelting leadore It has the advantage of a small stream which improves the operation of the latter  IT turns two wheels one of which is twentyfour feet in diameter and from the size and breadth makes a noble appearance At each end of these wheels is a balancewheel one of them sets the great refining bellows in motion the other that of the slaghearth  HERE is also a curious contrivance for saving the calx of the leadore which would otherwise have gone away in smoke It besides lessens the bad effects on the grounds above For this purpose two brick flues have been constructed one from each furnace each of them is horizontal and is supported by three arches and over each is a channel to contain a small current of water for the purpose of turning the wheels and also to condense the smoke in its passage These flues converge and meet a little beyond the third arch and terminate in the condensing room to the walls of which the calx adheres This room is opened three times ayear the calx is taken out and resmelted with some profit  THE two flues in issuing out of the building are united in one and are continued forming a right angle for a very considerable way Out of the end rises a vertical flue fortythree feet high out of which the smoke issues The length of the horizontal flues which pass over the arches is fiftyseven feet of the single one which passes from the room which catches the calx is two hundred and ten feet  BAGILLT UPPER WORKS  ABOUT three quarters of a mile farther on the bank above the road stands a large smeltingwork originally built by virtue of a  lease granted in by  Roger  and  Edward Pennant  esquires of  Bagillt  to  Francis St  l  y  and  Nicholas Twig  It was afterwards rebuilt and passed through various hands the  Smedlies  father and sons  Henry Vigars  of  Eaton  whose widow sold it to the  Gadlys  company That expiring corporation possessed it only from about  Michaelm  s  after descending from their ancient works at  Gadlys  In it again changed masters and was sold by the company to Mr  John Griffith  and Mr  Robert Aslett  of  London  BELOW them on the roadside  LOWER WORKS  were works of greater antiquity Those were in possession of two lessees before the year The first was Mr  Thomas White  the last was a gentleman well known by the name of Major  Roberts  He was of the antient house of  Plashewydd  near  Ruthin  His lease was surrendered and a new one granted in by  Roger Pennant  esquire to Mr  Benjamin Perrin  father to our respectable countryman Sir  Richard Perrin  baron of the exchequer I remember them standing but soon after they became a heap of ruins and at present their place is scarcely known  A MR  Warren  came into this country in and built  D  E BANK  on the land of  Roger Barnston  esquire a smeltinghouse on a new construction But it was scarcely warmed when it was disposed of to a Mr  Langworthy  mineral agent to earl  Grosvenor  THE collieries near these works have been very considerable  COLLIERIES  I remember about forty years ago there was between twenty and thirty thousand tons of coal upon bank the greatest quantity perhaps ever seen together The pits were then worked by the  Gadlys  company The company had imprudently given  their agent one  Lancester  an unlimited order for raising the coal This he found so profitable to himself that he never desisted till the discovery was made of his selfish views To expedite the working he engaged numbers of colliers from  Newcastle  and was the first in this country who made use of horses under ground The coal might have lain on the bank to this day if a dispute had not rose between the city of  Dublin  and the coaladventurers at  Whitehaven  This occasioned the citizens of  Dublin  to purchase this great stock which was all carried away before the differences were settled  FOR a considerable time after this glut of coal the collieries declined greatly and became very low till they were revived of late years by the spirit and perseverance of Mr  Roger Ellis  of  Cornish  in the parish of  Flint  who has erected a powerful fireengine on the roadside between  Greenfield  turnpikegate and  Flint  and raises great quantities of that important requisite  NANTYMOCH  QUIT the township of  Bagillt  after crossing a little rill issuing out of  Nantymoch  or  the dingle of the hogs  Here we enter the township of  Coleshillfawr  On the right on an eminence are the smeltingworks built by the grandfather of the present Sir  Richard Perrin  whose father continued the works and lived at  Farm  till he took up his residence at  Flint  About the year a new company was formed by  Paul Panton  esquire under the firm of himself the Reverend  Thomas Ince  and  Charles Pigot  esquire  COLESHILL  THE  DoomsdayBook  informs us that at the time of the compilation of that record  Coleselt  was held by  Robert de Roelent  or  Ruddlan  a valiant  Norman  nephew to  Hugh Lupus  earl of  Chester Edwyn  held it of  Robert  and as a freeman There was one taxable hide of land a land of one  caruca  or a ploughland On  C  l  silt  was one  Radman  four villeyns and two boors The  Radman  was the same with the  Rod  or  Radknights  who by the tenure of their land w  re bound to ride with or for their lord and to guard him  lady as often as they were required  THIS township took its name from the abundance of coal which is produced At present it gives name to one of the hundreds of the county In the  DoomsdayBook  this township is placed in the hundred of  Atiscros  a name which would have been lost was it not retained in a tract called  Croesati  a certain space round a cross not remote from  Flint  the pedestal of which I remember standing  BENEATH the smeltingwork is a neat building for the purpose of calcining calamine held by

descendants are given in the Appendix to this Work  ALL the coast of  Whiteford  and  Holywell  parishes are more particularly subject than the drier parts to pleurisies  DISEASES  intermittents and fevers of the putrid kinds The last chiefly in the places where the poorer people are obliged to crowd into small apartments  by which the air soon becomes soul and produces this species of fever  A CRUEL kind of quinzy has of late years infested these parishes and others adjacent In it raged particularly in the township of  Greenfield  and parish of  Halkin  and made dreadful havock among children from the age of three to that of five The average loss was four or five in seven In this visitation the disease did not attack adults not that instances are wanting in other places of its attacking grownup persons In  September  a Mr  Poole  his wife and mother were buried in one vault in  Bunhillfields  His daughter fell a victim also and made the sum of the family who died at the same time and by the same malignant disorder  THE name given by the learned to this fatal disease is  angina maligna  and  cynanche maligna Cynanche  because the patients are often observed to protrude their tongue far out of their mouth like an overheated dog  THE symptoms are too terrible for description They may uselessly affect parents who may safely trust to the medical people for the knowlege of them for they are by no means equivocal but if any one's curiosity is excited it may be satisfied by the perusal of the works of the late Dr  Fothergill  p and Dr  Huxham  's Essays p It seems to have been one of the  Nova Cohors Febrium  It was first observed in  Spain  in from whence it spread into  Malta Sicily Otr  nto Apulia Calabria  and finally in it broke out at  Naples  It also appeared in the  Archipelago  when  Tournefort  see his  Travels  i  p was in  Milo  in the year  In  Spain  it got the name of  garrotillo  from the horrible noise made by the patients like that of persons strangled by a rope  THIS fatal disorder reached  England  in Its first victims were two sons of Mr  Pelham  on the th of  November  of that year After this it seemed to disappear but began again in and with great fatality in when several of the inhabitants of  Brom  y  near  Bow  lost most of their children From Dr  Huxham  we learn that in it visited  C  wall  and from the latter part of that year to  May  carried off numbers of children and some adults  IN the year it appeared in  North Wales  From  March  th to  March  th our late worthy vicar the Reverend  Griffith Griffith  buried three children It was too much for his paternal feelings and ever after greatly hurt his mind And in the year that calamity visited the county of  Caernarvon  and from  January  th to  February  th the late Sir  Thomas Mostyn  baronet at  Gloddaeth  in  Caernarvonshire  lost four These were observed to have been the only instances of the disease in their respective neighborhoods  I CANNOT trace the progress of this disease any farther northward than my own country If it has not made any advances towards the colder climates it may be deemed a malady of the warm and temperate parts of  Europe  THAT it has found its way to the New World appears from the following instances In it visited many parts of  North America  from  Philadelphia  to  NewYork  and  NewEngland  and  with a rage unknown in  GreatBritain  for in  NewEngland  it depopulated whole villages And that it either continues on the continent or has revisited it is evident from its having appeared in  New York  in the year  THE  cynanche trachialis  or  croup  has appeared here too frequently A few years ago it destroyed not fewer than six children in the family of a respectable farmer in a neighboring parish  THE smeltingworks at  Flint  are at a very small distance from the eastern boundary of  Holywell  FLINT SMELLINGWORKS  The division of the parish of  Flint  from that of the latter is by a rill not far from the town of  Flint  The works are of great antiquity They are here mentioned as the last link of the chain of metallic operations along the shore There is no limiting the antiquity of the smeltingworks for we have proofs of very considerable ones having been near the town of  Flint  at a place called  Croes Ati  which is evident from the quantity of scoria of lead bits of leadore and fragments of melted lead discovered in several places I refer the reader for a full account of them and of the various antiquities met with on the spot to p vol i of my  Welsh Tour  which evince that they had been  Roman  works so that it is probable there had been a succession of smeltinghearths in one part or other of this county even to the present day  TO return to the works in question They are frequently known by the name of the  saltworks  which possibly implies that the site had been occupied by works of that nature prior to the existence of the smeltingworks They have been occupied  by several companies at present by Mr  Richard Ingleby  of  Halkin  May success be his reward for the seasonable and useful importation of barley in the late time of scarcity a critical relief to the numerous miners on the adjacent mountains in which he had no more interest than in the rest of the human race  APPENDIX  The Five Royal Tribes of  Cambria  from the '  British Antiquities revived  '

may be read It was expected that the whole book would have been printed in that year but by various delays too well known to authors it was not completed till the month of  March  I therefore beg the reader would consider that the several references which may be supposed to relate to can only intend for example p l 'next season' means the wheatsowing season of that year 'In the next year' means The attentive reader will discover many other reference of that kind  PAGE after paragraph dWe retain in  Whiteford  church the decent service of praying for the sick instead of lazily sinking it into the xxixth supplicatlon of the  Litany  The prayers on that occasion are so pathetic so admonitory to the congregation that I am amazed that any minister should remain insensible of the impropriety of the omission  I NOW cannot but most earnestly exhort the squires of every parish to attendance on divine service if it was only to hear the sad catalogue of the miserable objects which compose the largest part of those for whom the devotions I allude to are intended It will direct their benevolence to their relief They may find among them objects of their charity whom they may never otherwise have heard of They may find tenants to whom they ought to be fathers They certainly will find congenerous beings to whom every duty of humanity is enjoined by the SAVIOUR of the world This I should hope is thus irresistibly enforced  COME YE BLESSED OF MY FATHER INHERIT THE KINGDOM PREPARED FOR YOU FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD  FOR I WAS AN HUNGRED AND YE GAVE ME MEAT I WAS THIRSTY AND YE GAVE ME DRINK I WAS A STRANGER AND YE TOOK ME IN NAKED AND YE CLOATHED ME I WAS SICK AND YE VISITED ME I WAS IN PRISON AND YE CAME UNTO ME  THEN SHALL THE RIGHTEOUS ANSWER HIM SAYING LORD WHEN SAW WE THEE AN HUNGRED AND FED THEE OR THIRSTY AND GAVE THEE DRINK  WHEN SAW WE THEE A STRANGER AND TOOK THEE IN OR NAKED AND CLOTHED THEE  OR WHEN SAW WE THEE SICK OR IN PRISON AND CAME UNTO THEE  AND THE KING SHALL ANSWER AND SAY UNTO THEM VERILY I SAY UNTO YOU INASMUCH AS YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ONE OF THE LEAST OF THESE MY BRETHREN YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ME  To these benedictory verses let me add one in which the penalty as well as the reward is united I cannot resist the impulse as it is so admirably adapted to the times It shall be followed by an extract from p of this work which I communicated to the public through the channel of the  Chester  paper followed by some declarations to prevent the mistaking of any part I fervently wish to promote a friendly agreement between landlord and tenant between tenant and every poor laborer The benevolent Duke of BEAUFORT and I believe others of the benevolent GREAT have made the attempt and to  the glory of landlord and tenant are to this moment dispensing their generous plan to a grateful people Such an agreement was entered into by the farmers of part of this and a neighboring county but to their infamy many of them withdrew from their words and their signatures May the landlords become the instruments of compelling them to accept the blessing offered in the last part of the line and to shun the curse denounced in the first There is one description of men on whom it should fall in a most exemplary manner The badger or factor employed to exhaust the stock of corn and other provisions not by fair agreement but by openly raising the price by offering more than the farmer would have asked and even telling them in open market 'Ask what you will and we will give it' The poor since the repeal of the th and th of  Edward  IV by the th of  George  III are left defenceless The means of inflicting the punishment by the statute is taken away and they are to seek justice through the tedious expensive labyrinths of the common law  HE THAT WITHHOLDETH CORN THE PEOPLE SHALL CURSE HIM BUT BLESSING SHALL BE UPON THE HEAD OF HIM THAT SELLETH IT  Proverbs  chap xi ver  To the  EDITOR  of the  CHESTER COURANT  SIR  PERMIT me to convey through the channel of your paper a paragraph from a book which is still in the press  I would never grant a lease to a great corntenant I would preserve a power over his granary which legislature will not or  cannot assume Should he attempt by exportation to exhaust it in years of scarcity and not leave a sufficient supply for the country which produced the grain should he attempt a monopolyshould he refuse to carry a proper quantity to the next marketor should he refuse to sell to the poor who cannot attend the market corn in small quantities I WOULD INSTANTLY ASSUME THE POWER OF THE LANDLORD AND EXPEL HIM FROM MY ESTATE A just punishment for the tenant who through rapacity declines to comply with my desires excited with no other view than to promote the good of the public  THE end which we wish by the above radically to correct may soon be past cure I therefore commit the extract to your hands The evil is entirely local other parts of  Great Britain  are possibly unaffected by it and have no occasion to take alarm We do not wish the farmers solely to feed the poor we only request them to reserve in the country corn enough of EVERY kind to enable others to exert their benevolence to their poorer neighbors not by gratu  tous donations but by selling it at reasonable prices to those who are in want we do not ask it from the farmers at the prices of good times GOD forbid that we should deny them FAIR profits such as every other dealer has a right to I wish to inculcate universal justice but let us remember that CHARITY begins at home We shall gladly impart our superfluity to our most distant neighbors even should we be obliged to pay more for the bare competency we may reserve  T P  DOWNING  February    CONTENTS OF THE ACCOUNT OF  HOLYWELL PARISH
