Church in the  Strand  MDCCXXVIII  PREFACE  _TO remove a Difficulty in my Title and that we may not stumble at the Threshold some Preface to this new Undertaking may be necessary but it will be very short  If by  A SYSTEM  of this terrible thing called  Magick  my Readers should expect a Body of the Black Art as a Science a Book of Rules for Instruction in the Practice or a Magical Grammar for Introduction to young Beginners all I can say to such is that they will be mistaken  The World has perhaps been imposed upon in nothing more than in their Notions of this dark Practice as well its antient as its modern State Most People when they read of the antient Magicians think they are reading of old Necromancers and Conjurers when really at first they were very honest Men and now when they read of them in their modern Practice they take them for honest Fellows when they are generally speaking meer  Juglers Cheats Mountebanks and Posture masters or else real Wizards and downright Dealers with the  Devil    There is One Sort would fain be called  Cunning Men  than which nothing can be a grosser piece of Delusion and 'tis not their Cunning but their Clients want of Cunning that gives them the least Appearance of Common Sense in all their Practice 'Tis a strange Piece of Art where Fools cheat Fools and the Blind and the Ignorant are imposed upon by the Blind and the Ignorant  All the Discovery I can make by it is to note what a visible Difference there is between Cunning and Wit between Slight of Hand as I may call it and Understanding 'Tis evident the Pretenders to Magick at this time are so far from dealing with the  Devil  that they must certainly be dealt with by the  Devil  that have any thing to do with them  In the first Ages they were Wise Men in the middle Age Madmen in these latter Ages Cunning Men In the earliest Time they were Honest in the middle Time Rogues in these last Times Fools At first they dealt with Nature then with the  Devil  and now not with the  Devil  or with Nature either In the first  Ages the Magicians were wiser than the People in the second Age wickeder than the People and in our Age the People are both wiser and wickeder than the Magicians  I see no great Harm in our present Pretenders  o Magick if the poor People could but keep  heir Money in their Pockets and that they  hould have their Pockets pick'd by such an  performing unmeaning ignorant Crew as  hese are is the only Magick that I can find  n the whole Science  The best Course that I can think of to cure  he People of this Itch of their Brain the  Tarantula  of the present Age in running to  unning Men as you call them and the most  ikely to have Success is this of laughing at  hem the Satyr has reform'd the Age of  any a Folly which the Solid and the Solemn  ould never reach Even general Vice would the Men of Wit and Men of Quality  oin in the Attempt might be hiss'd out of  he World tho' all the Preaching and all the Preachers shou'd prove fruitless and exhausted Men are to be ridicul'd imto good Manners when they won't be cudgell'd into it  Your modern  Harlequins  especially so exquisitely contriv'd and so perfectly well perform'd  as those of late by Mr  Rich  in which n  to flatter him we must acknowledge he has ou  done all that was before him have gone fa+ther to expose and run down the Magick I a  speaking of and cure the World of the  Hypp  and the Vapours than the whole Stage could  before nay than all the brightest Dramati  Performances of the last Age could pretend to  Never was the popular Frenzy better expose the Ignorance on one side and the Impudence  the other more accurately laid open the M  +mickry is mimick'd to the Life the Magician made a Fool the Fool tickl'd into more Wit an  the  Devil  himself laught out of Countenance  We leave the Remainder to be compleat  by the same Hand the Success cannot fail while the Senses and the Passions are  be wrought upon by the Eyesight Our M  +thod looks the same Way only that we brin  it up from its Original and pursue it to t  End of its Prospect Mr  Rich  shows yo  what foolish things you are just now doing we show you what your Ancestors did b  +fore you and what still worse things the Age to come are like to do after you  Let no Man be disgusted at the good A  +count we give of the Original and Wisdom  the  Magi  and then call them Magicians if we will debauch the Word with a degeneracy of Practice the Fault is our own Their Magick was truly Science whereas ours is neither Magick or Science but a kind of  Devilism  a Practice carry'd on by Men that would be wicked if they did not want Wit and are no otherwise Harmless than as they happen to be Fools  Even at its best 'tis a  Babel  like Confusion that speaks several Languages and none to be understood a compleat Degeneracy of or Deviation from common Sense a Complication of Negatives that how many soever you put together won't make up one Affirmative  Now to bring this  Nothing  from the  Something  it deriv'd from tho' it seems a little Difficult yet 'tis very Necessary and this is the Reason why I call it a History  I have trac'd it as far back as Antiquity gives us any Clue to discover it by it seems to have its Beginning in the Ignorance and Curiosity of the darkest Ages of the World when Miracle and something Wonderful was expected to confirm every advanc'd Notion and when the wise Men having rack'd their Invention to the utmost call'd in the Devil to  their Assistance for want of better Help and those that did not run into Satan's Measures and give themselves up to the Infernal yet trod so near and upon the very edge of Hell that it was hard to distinguish between the Magician and the Devil and there they have gone on ever since so that almost all the Dispute between us and the Magicians is that they say they converse with good Spirits and we say if they deal with any Spirits it is with the Devil let the following Sheets determine the Matter  Hail  Dangerous Science  falsly call'd Sublime  Which treads upon the very brink of Crime  Hell's Mimick Satan's Mountebank of State  Deals with more Devils than Heav'n did e'er create  The Infernal

originally understood  _BEFORE I come to the main End of this Undertaking which is plainly laid down in my Title 'tis necessary to explain the Terms and to determine fully what is and is not to be understood by  Magick  the  Black Art  and such like hard Words as we shall be oblig'd to make frequent Use of as we go along  I am willing to suppose my Readers not so unacquainted with the ancient Usage as not to know that the Word  Magick  had a quite different Signification in former Times from what it is now apply'd to and that the People who studied or profess'd that which we now call  Magick  were quite another sort of Folk than those worthy Gentlemen who now apply themselves to that Profession  In a Word a  Magician  was no more or less in the ancient  Chaldean  Times than a  Mathematician  a  Man of Science who stor'd with Knowledge and Learning as Learning went in those Days was a kind of walking Dictionary to other People and instructed the rest of Mankind in any Niceties and Difficulties which occur'd to them and which they wanted to be inform'd about and in this Sense we are to be understood when we speak of the Magicians in  Egypt  in  Persia  in  Babylon  c  Thus when any Omens ill Signs and Tokens Dreams or other strange things happen'd in those Times whether publickly in the Air or particular to Persons and Families we find not only the  ordinary People  but even Kings and Princes sent immediately for the Magicians and the wise Men the Southsayers  c  to tell them what the Meaning o  such things was  These Magicians are explain'd on many Occasions by the term of  wise Men  and that Term again by Men of Knowledge and more than ordinary Understanding Men  in a word  who studied Nature look'd up into and made Observations from the Motions of the Stars and other heavenly Bodies and who  as 'tis said in the Scriptures  understood the Signs of the Times the Face of the Heavens and the Influences of the Superior Luminarie there who searched into the Arcana of Nature an  were Masters of  perhaps a little  experimental Philo+sophy I say a little for Reasons which I shall repeat presently  It was no Impropriety in Speech to call such a  these  wise Men  at that time tho' perhaps the utmos  of their Knowledge might arrive to no more tha  what we would now justly call superficial Because at that time the Knowledge of Nature wa  very green and young in the World and the Philosopher of those times if he was to be rated by th  Rules Men are pleased to judge by at this time woul  be something like our Learned Friend Sir  Tho J  whose particular Honour it was to be a Doctor among Fools and a Fool among Doctors  To these  Magicians  Men went on the several Occasions hinted as above for the Solution of  doubtful Questions  to be resolved and directed in difficult and intricate  Undertakings  to be advised in things of Moment and these were therefore called  Sages  first and for a long time and afterwards  Magi  from the greatness of their Wisdom Hence the wise  Statesmen  to whom the Government of the  Median Interregnum  was committed were called  Magi  as wise Men to whom alone it was fit to intrust so important an Article as that of the Government of an Empire  Thus afterwards in the  Israelites  times their  wise Men  were called by another but very significant Name or Term  viz  SEERS a Word afterwards held in such Veneration that they thought fit to bestow it upon their  Prophets  who also were called  Seers  tho' afterwards they obtained a superior Title namely that of  Man of God  But before that I say the wiser Men were called  Seers  and this is most expresly signified in that eminent Text  Sam  ix where 'tis said that  before time  they used to say when they wanted to enquire of God that is to enquire about any thing difficult  come and let us go to the  SEER that is to the  Magician  the  wise Man  the  Prophet  or what else you please to call him  It is plain from the same Text also that they sometimes went to those People called SEERS upon meaner Enquiries for they took it for granted that those  Seers  dealt in all secret Matters Thus  Ahaziah  sent to  Baalzebub  when he was sick to know if he should live or dye  Kings  i and so the King of  Syria  's Captains told their Master that  Elisha  the Prophet told the King of  Israel  what he did in his Bedchamber  Kings  vi And to bring it down to a meaner Case still  even when  Saul  wanted but to find his Father's lost Asses or Cattle his Servant said to him  let us go and enquire of the  SEER and so they did and found News of them  Likewise it appears by the same Text that those  Seers  or  Prophets  or  Magi  made an Employment of it that it was their Business to tell Men of their lost Goods direct them in their Way foretel of their Health and the like and that they made a Livelyhood or Trade of it therefore when  Saul  's Servant proposed to him to go to the SEER  Saul  made a Difficulty of it because he had nothing to give him as if he should have said I have no Money in my Pocket and not a Loaf of Bread to give the  cunning Man  or SEER and how should I expect that he should give me any Account of my Cattle for nothing Then when the Servant told him he had a fourthpart of a Shekle of Silver in his Purse  which by the way was not above  seven Pence halfpenny or thereabouts  Saul  was mighty glad resolving to give the  lowpriz'd Magician  or Prophet that vast Fee to tell him what was become of his Father's Asses  It seems the Lawyers Fees were not so high in those Days as they have been since for if he had not had that Piece of Silver perhaps about as big as an  English  Groat  I say  if he had not had that a couple of halfpenny Barly Loaves it seems would have been as good and have done as well those Loaves being not usually bigger than our Halfpenny or at best than our Penny Wheaten brown Bread Loaves are now  Again you find when  Benhadad  King of  Damascus  sent to  Elisha  the Prophet to know if h  should live or dye he sent the Prophet a Present forty Camels loaden with all the good things o  Damascus    Kings  viii A large Fee But 'tis t  be supposed the Gift sent was not suited to th  Prophet so much as to the Sender he gave as a King but still we find the SEERS were suppos'd to make the Gain their Business  That it was the same thing with the  Magi  before that we have no reason to doubt tho' we have no Particular in Story relating to that part But we find those  Southsayers Magicians  and  wise Men  who were sent for by  Pharaoh  King of  Egypt  to interpret his Dream were to have receiv'd great Rewards if they had given Satisfaction to the King and  Joseph  we see did receive great Rewards as well as Honour on that Account  Again afterwards in the Case of  Nebuchadnezzar  's Dream there is a sufficient Testimony that those  wise Men Astrologers Magicians  c were esteemed not to be Wizards and Dealers with the Devil but only as I have explain'd the Word above meer  Philosophers  or wise Men  Men of Learning  and Knowledge Men of  Science  and of Skill in the works of Nature for when the King demanded of them to tell him not only the Interpretation of the Dream but the Dream it self and threaten'd them with Death in case they fail'd to perform it they expostulate with the King upon the unreasonableness of the Proposal as a thing that no King in the World would expect from them and that was not in the power of Nature to perform  As if they had said  does your Majesty think we deal with the Devil that you should expect such a Piece of Work  as this  from  us  it is not in the Power of any or of all the wise Men  or Philosophers  in the World and therefore it cannot be imagined we should do it but let the King tell us the Dream and then we will interpret it and that's as much as Man can do    'Tis plain from hence not only that the  Magi  or  Magicians  in those Days were not really Conjurers and Dealers with the Devil but that they were understood to be what we may call  Scholars  Men  of Learning of Wisdom and of a superior Understanding So when the King calls for  Daniel  to prefer him it is said he did it because an  excellent Spirit was found in him  and in another Place 'tis said that  the Spirit of the Holy Gods was in him  whereas at the same time 'tis certain that the King esteemed him as one of the  Magicians  nay and he was set over them as the Chief and Governor of all the rest Certainly then they did not take those Magicians to be what we have since understood of ours  viz  Dealers with the Devil and Sorcerers such as ought to be punished for having or using unlawful Arts and Practices with evil Spirits and the like  Had this been the common Opinion of them they would have been treated after another manner both then and in afterAges for not only among the  Jews  but in other Nations such as we call now  Magicians  were punished as Criminals  But to go back a little to Originals and to fetch up Knowledge from the Fountain Man born ignorant arrives to very little Knowledge but what comes by one of these two Channels  First  Long Experience Study and Application  Secondly  Teaching and Instruction from those that went before  I shall insist only upon the last and that particularly for the sake of what was  Antediluvean  The most early Knowledge which Mankind obtain'd in those Days is suppos'd to be by Teaching immediately from Heaven for Example  Adam  and  Eve  's Mouths were open'd at the same time with their Eyes and they could speak and knew what Language to speak as soon as they were made But 'tis most certain also that all the speaking World since  Adam  and  Eve  learnt it successively from them by mere Imitation of Sounds teaching of Parents and Nurses and the like  After  Adam  his Posterity having learnt to speak immediately from him and so to converse with one another a consummate acquir'd Knowledge in several other things quickly follow'd particular Arts and Sciences were either taught by Inspiration from Heaven or attain'd by the exquisite Capacities of their Minds One having a Genius to this Another to that kind of Knowledge as one to Music another to working in and finding out Metals and Minerals in the Earth then melting refining casting and other Operations and Improvements as Knowledge came in by the Door of Experiment  Adam  's Posterity I mean his particular House or Family learnt to speak more immediately from him and  Eve  their Mother by meer imitation of Sounds as we do to this day from one another  But having thus obtained Speech from their immediate Parents all other acquir'd Knowledge mention'd above such as of their Improvement of Culture Discoveries in Nature  and the like  seem'd to be the Consequence Of a vehement and inflam'd Desire after Knowledge planted in their Minds by Nature it self an inquiring Disposition being sensible of a vast Treasure hidden in Nature apt for Discovery and which as it were waited only for the Search in order to open it self to their View for the general Good A vast capacious Understanding fitted for that Search and which we have reason to believe the Antediluvean Fathers were more than ordinarily furnished with guiding them directly to the Search after and into all the Arcana of Nature with a Readiness and Accuracy so pointed as if they had been beforehand instructed  what  to search for  how  to search for it and  where  to find it A secret Inspiration from Heaven filling them with or at  least directing them to the Knowledge of things in a more than ordinary manner  NB  We cannot doubt but were there now to appear a Man perfectly untaught not having converst at all with Men taught and instructed before him and yet should have a Treasure of such Knowledge in his Mind exerting it self in Action to such a degree as was ordinary to the Patriarchs of the Antediluvean Age we should presently give him up for a  Magician  in the grossest Acceptation of the Word and say in short that he deals with the  Devil    But be it so or not and let the consummate Knowledge of those Patriarchs come which way it will and be as great as it will or as you will suppose it to be this is certain it died with them 'twas all drown'd in the Flood the  Postdiluvean  Age inherited very little of it or if they did it was drown'd again in the Flood of Vice and Wickedness which almost as soon overspread the World as the People did the Plains of  Shinaar  and much sooner than they spread the rest of the Earth with their Posterity however fast they multiplied  Nor do I wrong the People of those first Ages after the Flood in the least when I say they seem'd to have lost all that fund of Knowledge all that capacious Understanding and all that sacred Inspiration which their Predecessors the Antediluveans were Masters of I need go no further for an Example of it than the building of  Babel  For was it possible that any thing so absurd and ridiculous could have entred into the Thoughts of Men if they had not been sunk into an unexpressible Degeneracy as to Sense a meer Stupidity of Understanding To say nothing of their having lost all Pretence to  Inspiration  so far were they from any Share of sacred Light in it that they could not be said to  have acted with common Sense Bless us to build a House to reach up to Heaven or as we may with more Propriety express it to build a Staircase to go up into Heaven by and that in case of another Flood too which adds to the Madness of the design many ways  They had certainly no Notion of Heaven it self not to speak of religious Notions of Heaven they must be entirely dark and stupid as to the Philosophy of it The immense Distance the differing Regions the Alteration of things in their natural Circumstances and Situation by the Way or in the Passage  They had no Understanding of their own Constitution or at least they must have very gross and absurd Conceptions about it as particularly of their breathing and subsisting in the Regions above the Atmosphere and in the pure unmix'd  Aether  or what else it should be called which they who mounted up to such Height would be sure to meet with and in which they might as easily conceive an Impossibility of breathing as they could conceive of the Impossibility of living without Breath  They must have had no Notion of the Nature of the Flood it self as that of the Power Force and Weight of the Waters when moving in such a collected Body how unable any thing  they could build  would be to resist the Force and not be presently blown up and driven away by the Stream  They must be utterly ignorant of the Nature of the Earth on which their Building stood how no Foundation could be laid so deep or so firm in it but what by the Violence of such an immense Ocean of Water would be loosen'd and overwhelm'd and the Fabrick by consequence be brought down the Earth which upheld it being wash'd away  They must be wholly ignorant of what our learned Theory Men insist to have been the Causes of the Deluge namely an Absorption or breaking in of the Surface of that Earth which was before a known Cavity or Hollow fill'd up with Water into which the Earth fell with a Violence equal to the Fall of the highest Mountain that could be supposed to fall into the lowest Subterranean Deep and in which case the Height and Strength and Magnitude of their Building could only serve to make its Fall more violent more certain and more terrible  All these things and many more which Nature had they been capable of consulting it would have dictated to them they must be perfectly ignorant of otherwise they could never with a Deliberation and long consulting one another as the Relation of the Story implies have gone about so ridiculous a piece of Work as that of  Babel  than which nothing attempted by the grossest and dullest Fancies on Earth was ever more abominably foolish and ignorant  Were these the Posterity of the wise Antediluvean Age whose Minds were inspired from Heaven and whose Understandings were so eminently large and capacious whose Genius led them to the inventing the most useful Arts and to exalt them in quest of the noblest parts of Science such as Musick in particular and to make the most refin'd Experiments such as the melting mixing separating and refining of Metals and which was still as much as all the rest the finding those Metals in the Oar as the Iron the Copper the Silver and the Gold of which we find they had a compleat Knowledge and carried it on no doubt to the most useful Experiments Thus  Jabal  and  Jubal  for Example the Sons of  Lamech  who severally applying themselves to useful Arts became Instructors  of their Posterity in  Culture  of the Earth Husbandry breeding of Cattle  c  Others we find were Proficients in Philosophy and the study of  Nature  for the Doctrine of Sounds is one of the nicest Parts of philosophical Study and we find them immediately Masters of Musick and inventing and instructing others in making the Instruments of Musick and particularly those Nicest and most Difficult of all the rest the Harp and the Organ that is to say WindMusick which is Vocal and Musick by  Vibration  which we call Instrumental likewise  TubalCain  their Brother who was the first Artificer of whom we may say that he was a true natural Mechanick and the first and best  Tinker  in the World  In the room of this capacious Understanding and this inquiring and applying Temper in those Ages behold a stupid Generation risen up in Succession stript as naked of the natural Glories of their Ancestors as the Earth was of its natural Fruitfulness after the Curse in  Paradise  and instead of applying themselves to useful Arts and to the acquiring of Knowledge grown as indolent as they were ignorant having like  Solomon  's Fool no delight in Understanding  Instead of qualifying themselves to instruct their Posterity we see no marks of Wisdom left behind them fit for Imitation nothing that could recommend them to their Children for any thing but a Race of brutish unpolish'd unfinish'd Creatures that neither understood Heaven or Earth themselves or any thing about them that seem'd qualified for nothing but meerly as the rest of the Brutal World were to propagate their Kind and overspread the Earth  Nor in their Multiplying their Species did they seem to promise any thing but to people the World with a Race of Fools as ignorant and sordid  as their Antediluvean Progenitors had been out rageously wicked a Race that threaten'd to make Heaven as sick of them for their Folly as it was of those that went before them for their Corruptions and abominable Vices and that might be a likely to have brought a Deluge upon them for thei  obstinate untractable Ignorance as the other had been for their Rebellion and Looseness ha  not God's Promise not to destroy the World any more been their Security  Nor indeed were they less corrupt  their Capacities consider'd  than the old World whose flagrant Crimes had involv'd them in a general Destruction and if they fell short in any thing it was fo  want of Wit not for want of Wickedness  This appears in all their subsequent Conduct from the first peopling of the World after  Noah  to that foolish  BabelBuildingAge  I speak of In the old World we found that at least for a time Men began to call on the Name of the Lord and the Patriarchs of that Age were famous for Piety of whom 'tis said as particularly of  Enoch  that  he walked with God  an emphatic significant Expression which our learned Commentators have spent a great deal of Time in expatiating upon and explaining The Scripture again expresses this walking with God to be an Act of Faith and quotes it  Heb  xi  ver  as a glorious Example of such Faith as was rewarded with an immediate Translation of the Person into Heaven  He was not for GOD took him  and from which the most exquisitely and accomplishtly whimsical Mr  Asgill  form'd his new System of going the nearest way Home  to Heaven  by the farthest way about a fiery Chariot instead of dying as if the former were not a Change as well as the  latter  and as if Heaven had not already made the best Choice for us But tho' he suffer'd Martyrdom for his Scheme having been expell'd  the Parliament of two Kingdoms for it we do not find he has yet had the Benefit of his Project so we must wait till he is pleased to make the Experiment  But to return to the  Antediluveans  The old World  I say  as wicked as they were had some shadow of Good in them and for some Years nay some hundreds of Years they maintain'd the Character of the  Sons of God  before they were debauched by the  Daughters of Men  that is to say before they blended the Race with the corrupt Seed of  Cain  and mingled Blood with Idolaters Where by the way we have an accurate Description of the Times I mean in those early Days of the Race 'tis evident 'twas just then as 'tis now the  Ladies  were the Devils of the Age the Beauties the Toasts the fine Faces were the Baits the Hell lay concealed in the Smiles of the charming Sex They were the  Magicians  taking the Word in its present Acceptation and its grossest Sense There lay the Witchcraft and its Force was so irresistible that it drew in even the Sons of God just in a word as it does now and of which I shall have Occasion to speak again at large as we go onIn the mean time I descend with the Story to the next Generation  The  Antediluveans  might have something of Religion in them however fatally mix'd with Crime but as for the new Goodfornothing Race we hardly read of any thing that ever was to be found among them that may be called valuable from  Noah  himself downward and even  Noah  himself we all know fell into the Debaucheries of Wine and if you will believe Tradition continued in it a hundred Years Now from him and from his immediate Race Nature seem'd prepared for the utmost Degeneracy for they fell into all manner of Crimes nay into the worst Crimes first for they did not  begin low and sin gradually but immediately afte  the Drunkenness of  Noah  himself his Posterity de+generated into  Idolatry  or rather return'd to it fo  some think and that not without Probability e+nough that  Noah  's Sons were Idolaters before th  Flood and were saved in the Ark  such was the Wi  of God  meerly for being the Posterity or Progen  of a righteous Father if so then they only returned to the Idolatry which they had been practis'd it before  But  be that as it will  'tis certain that the Posterity of  Noah  fell immediately into Idolatry and tha  all his wise Dictates which he gave to his Children which for so many Ages were preserved by  oral Traduction  and were called  the Precepts of Noah  had no sufficient Effect upon them to prevent that hated Sin of Idolatry no not even while he was alive  It is worth observing here indeed were it not too grave for your Reading how effectually  Noah  by the horrid Defection of his own Morals in that One Act of  Drunkenness  I say how effectually he shut the Door against the Force of all his Own future Instructions He was till then indeed a Preacher of Righteousness and had been so to the Antediluvean World for near six hundred Years but after that he might preach indeed if he would but what Regard would he obtain when the debauch'd Instructor had expos'd himself by his Drunkenness to the Ridicule instead of the Reverence of his Posterity and when the drunken Monitor by his own Practice had render'd his Instructions fruitless and ridiculous  How justly might they bid him hold his Tongue and go and reform his Life before he pretended to instruct them bid him first learn the Precepts he taught and show them by his Example what it was he would have them practise How might they  upbraid him with exhorting them to be sober while he went drunk to bed exhorting them to Modesty and Virtue while he appear'd in the most scandalous manner lying drunk in his Tent and his Nakedness expos'd to the Banter and impious Jest of his Grandson  Ham  How must it cover his Face with Blushes to find he had dishonoured by his Example the Doctrine of Sobriety which he had preached to his Children who were thereby brought to mock him rather than to listen to him and to make Ballads of him rather than copy his Precept for their Imitation  But I say this is a Subject too solemn for the Age and you will presently tell me I am going to write a Comment upon the ninth Chapter of  Genesis  So I leave it for you to consider of and return to the Chronology of early Wickedness in the Postdiluvean World  Noah  being thus disabled by his own falling into Crime from instructing his Posterity what was the Consequence he liv'd to see them run headlong into that worst of all Crimes  Idolatry  and the Worship of GOD sunk  as it were  out of the World even in his own time and before his Eyes  This is evident from  Abraham  whom the Scripture acknowledges to have been not an Idolater only but even bred up in  Idolatry  while he lived in  Mesopotamia  and 'tis certain  Abraham  was born above fifty Years before  Noah  died So that  Noah  liv'd to see his Posterity degenerated into Idolatry not all his Preaching or Practice being able to prevent it  Having thus seen all the Wickedness of the old World revived in its new Inhabitants without the Wit and Capacities which they had before and the Race being thus entirely degenerated we must begin all our historical Account of them with taking them just as we find them and that will bring us directly to the Subject I propose  The Race being thus as I have said stript naked of the Beauties of their Ancestors whether in Matters of Sense and Understanding or in Matters of Piety and Religion and running on into all manner of foolish and simple as well as wicked Excesses it is not at all wonderful if when any particular Person appeared more than ordinary knowing or but a Lover of and Searcher after Knowledge and Wisdom such a Person was honoured in a more than ordinary manner was reverenced as an extraordinary Man exalted in the common Esteem when alive and perhaps placed among the Stars after his Death that he who shined in their Esteem when living might be supposed to be made immortal at his Death and to be exalted to shine in a higher Orbit  Hence it became a vulgar Error among the first Ages but was riveted so fast in the Minds of Men that nothing could perswade them not to believe it  viz  that the Stars were all the transparent bright Souls of their wise Ancestors who for their Virtue and Wisdom were exalted by the immortal Powers to a Station of Glory and were made to shine in that manner for the farther enlightning the World to whom they had been so beneficent when they were here and from hence it came at last that all their great Men and especially their Kings were thus reverenced and exalted whether they were good Men or no  It could not be but that in Process of Time as the World grew populous tho' they had none of the rare Parts and exalted Understandings of the  Antediluvean  Patriarchs yet there would be some Men of a more refined Genius and of more capacious Souls than others Surely the World would not be all Fools or not all equally and alike so nor can I doubt but that while the gross of the People went about that harebrain'd preposterous  piece of Work which we call  Babel  there were some wiser Heads who tho' they might not care to oppose themselves to the popular Humour or perhaps to their Resentment and did not ridicule and mock the Undertaking yet look'd on it with a different View and entertain'd wiser Notions of Things and consequently when by the Confusions which afterwards happened among the Builders on Account of their Speech they were oblig'd to give over their Work might take the Liberty to expostulate with them upon the Weakness of the Design and convince them afterwards that it was an unlikely impracticable thing Or perhaps those Men had calmly argued that Part with them before and had as far as the times would bear it declared their Sentiments about it these Men would certainly obtain the Character of wise Men upon this Occasion and be valued by them  as such  upon all subsequent Events  As upon the Confusion of Languages the several Families who understood one anothers Speech kept together so 'tis very probable they did not separate singly every one running his own way but by Families and Tribes or by Nations as their Speech was or was not understood by one another and this was directed by Providence no doubt for it is said in the Text God scatter'd them upon the Face or over the Face of the whole Earth  It is not unlikely but that when they left off Building and found they were not able to pursue the Design with that Impossibility they began also to see into the Folly and Absurdity of the Undertaking and began more and more every day to reflect upon their Stupidity in going about it that being withal ashamed of the Work they were ashamed of the Place too and went every Man or  Tribe of Men at least  their own Way to get as far out of the sight of it as they could I  grant indeed that this is but my Conjecture but I think 'tis a very just Conjecture and 'tis made on Supposition that all wise Men look back with Regret upon those Actions of their Lives which they have been drawn into and in which they have reason to see themselves mistakenIn short a  no Man loves to see himself a Fool and if he ha  done a foolish thing does not care to have the Remembrance of it always in his View so generally if he cannot get the Object removed and put ou  of his sight he will remove himself from it if he can  Upon this foot I cannot doubt but that all the People quitted the Plain of  Shinaar  as fast as they could and run away from the hated Monument o  their Shame we would have done so our selves and I cannot doubt I say but they did so too  Suppose then the People to be upon their March and going to the several Quarters of the World whither they were directed to settle and  let that b  where you and Sir  Walter Raleigh  please  for tha  learned Author following Scripturelight has really marshall'd them and laid out their several Routs a  exactly and authenticly as if he had been CommissaryGeneral and had gone before to provide them Quarters  Wherever I say these several Nations went and in what Country soever they settled and fixed their Abode tho' the Government and Monarchy of each Division was Patriarchal and Hereditary yet we shall find upon several Occasions afterward that they had among them many particular Men famous for their Wisdom and Knowledge and for their Search into the Secrets of Nature whose consummate Wisdom by degrees not only obtained for them a more than ordinary Reverence among the People but in short brought the People to subject themselves to their Government and make some of them Kings  Thus  Cadmus  a  Phoenician  born became King of  Thebes  in  Greece  by having obtain'd the Fame of a wise Man and one who dedicated himself to the common Good of Mankind So  Prometheus  obtain'd the Government of a Part of  Armenia  and  Atlas  the like in  Africa  and thus several others by their Wisdom and earnest Search after Knowledge obtain'd the Empire and Government of those Countries where their Wisdom was so conspicuous But pray take this with you as you go that  those Days are over  that Wisdom crowns no Man Now except it be with the Rage and Malice of Enemies with Poverty and Insult  Probitas laudatur Alget  Honesty shall be prais'd and starv'd Wisdom and Knowledge are Marks for the Men of Power to shoot at to be High and Great is to be Wise and Good  He that is Rich is Wise  And all Men learned Poverty despise  But this is but an Excursion I come back reproved The  Magi  were not always Kings or Emperors the Wise Men and the  Southsayers  the  Magicians  and  Astrologers  who by the way were all but one sort of People were often times in mean Circumstances as to Money even in those graver Days they acted for the publick Good indeed but it was in Conjunction with their own Interest too they had their Rewards for Southsaying and Divining and when the King of  Syria  asked his Servants to go to  Elisha  the Prophet to enquire for him about his Health he bad them take a Present in their Hand for the  Man of God    I cannot indeed say how high priz'd things went in those Days and whether Wisdom was not underrated  then as it is now whether there was due Encouragement given for the Search or whether Wit went threadbare and in Rags as it does since Authors are not agreed upon it indeed and it may be hard to bring them to a Point It is true later and more modern Philosophers learned to despise Money and  Solon  preferred Wisdom and a retired Life to the Wealth of  Croesus  but in the more early Times of the World the Knowledge of Nature and the Study of Wisdom as it went then seemed to be a communicative Good which therefore as they that reaped the Benefit of it ought to pay for and did so so their  wise Men  grew in time mercenary and mean as in other Places  This leads me to the Times when the primitive Wisdom of those early Days beginning as I said to be more common and that the  Magi  had communicated much of their Knowledge to the common People Those then who still pretended to be something beyond the rest of the World were obliged to go higher in their Studies and enquire into Nature view the Aspect of the Heavens calculate the Motions of the Stars and especially dwell upon their Influences in human Affairs which is since called Astrology  By this Study they obtained the Name of  Southsayers  and  Astrologers  added to that of  Magicians  which they had before and on the foot of these Studies they interpreted Dreams explain'd good and bad Omens foretold Events and perhaps play'd some Legerdemain Tricks too to impose upon the World as their worthy Successors do to this Day and in a word 'tis likely they did all those things then which these People do now of whom we say with more Freedom perhaps than Truth that they deal with the  Devil    Not that those People were charged at least not yet with any criminal Conversation with the  old Gentleman nor if I understand how the Case stood with Satan at that time had he any manner of Occasion for them but did his Business quite another way for the Devil had Altars and Temples of  his own  was another kind of a King in those Days than he has appeared to be since THEN he gave Audience in form of  a Deity  and saw himself worshipped like a God almost throughout the whole World Here under the Name of  Baal  there  Moloch  here in one manner there in another Nor had the GOD of Heaven One Temple in the World when the Devil had a great many scatter'd here and there almost in every Nation I assure you however modern Writers think fit to represent him he scorn'd in those days to go about like a poor shabby Outatheels Devil as he has done since and may perhaps do now No He appeared in State and as he usurped divine Honours so he made a Figure suitable to his Usurpation and had his Shrines and his Votaries his Priests and his Places of Worship in whatever Shapes or Places he pleas'd to be worshipp'd in Thus as  Dagon  he had a House of solemn Worship at  Ashdod    Sam  v and as  Baalzebub  at  Ekron  and the like  Now as the Devil had thus the Government of the whole World in his own Hand and that he was almost in the very Letter of it  the God of the World  so he had no need at that time to employ secret Agents and work by way of Familiars or private Intelligence as he does since nor to do the  honest Men  Justice had any of the  Southsayers  and  Magicians  and those which were at first called their  wise Men  any Conversation with the Devil at all no or with any of his Works they carried on no Business for him  But they were Men of Thought or if you please Men of deeper thinking than the ordinary sort They studied the Sciences and enquired into useful  things searched the Works of Nature and Providence studied the Meaning and End of things the Causes and Events and consequently were able to see farther into the ordinary Course and Causes both of things about them and things above them  than other Men    In the study of Astronomy they soon found the secret Influences of the Stars upon the Surface of the Earth upon Plants and Animals nay upon both Man and Beast as for Example How the Growth and Virtues of earthly Bodies were guided and govern'd by the heavenly and how even the Events of the greatest moment on Earth oftentimes obey'd the Force of those heavenly Bodies their Conjunctions Oppositions near or remote Positions Revolutions and Appearances and accordingly they were capable of making such probable Conjectures of things not yet come to pass as were amazing and surprizing to the rest of the World and by which they took them either for Men fill'd with sacred Knowledge and that those things were communicated to them immediately from Heaven or that however they got it they had a prophetick Knowledge of what should come to pass and could foretel Events even before the apparent Causes were ordinarily known  This gave the common People an extraordinary Veneration for the Persons of those  Magicians  and  wise Men  as they had an awful Notion of their exceeding Wisdom and Knowledge Thus  Nebuchadnezzar  after he had exalted the Prophet  Daniel  to be the chief of his  wise Men  stoopt to him with a kind of Reverence and begins his Address not like that of a Tyrant the Terror of the World as he at that time really was but as One that had an Awe upon his Mind of the great Respect he ought to show to a Person divinely inspir'd  as Daniel was  See the Text  Dan  iv  O  Belteshazzar  Masier  of the  Magicians  because I know that the Spirit of the holy Gods is in thee  cAnd so in the th Verse of the same Chapter  At last  Daniel  came in before me whose Name is  Belteshazzar  after the Name of my  GOD  and in whom is the Spirit of the holy Gods    These were the  Magicians  of the first Ages of the World and such was the Opinion which the People had of them in those days not that they were Conjurers or  cunning Men  or such sort of People as we now call them but were Men who at that time knew more than the ordinary rate of Knowledge instructed others to know and were endued from Heaven with extraordinary Degrees of Wisdom above other Men Nor was the Respect paid to them equal but more or less in degree according to the particular Degrees of sacred Inspiration which they were supposed to have Thus in the Case of the Prophet  Daniel  as above the King treats him not as a  Magician  only nor as the Chief of the  Magicians  only but as a Man fill'd with higher degrees of Wisdom and Knowledge than any nay than all the rest of the  Magicians  of the Age put together as appears  Dan  iv  Now thou O  Belteshazzar  declare the Interpretation thereof  that is of the Dream  for as much as all  the wise Men of my Kingdom  are not able to make known unto me  the Interpretation  but thou art able for the Spirit of the holy Gods is in thee    This is still further explain'd in the next Chapter and in the Transactions of the next Reign I say it is farther and fully explain'd to my Purpose  viz  as to what was the People's Opinion of these  Magicians  as well as their King The Story is very particular It was in the Reign of  Belshazzar  the Son and Successor according to some of the Great  Nebuchadnezzar  King of  Babylon  when the King saw a Hand come out and writing Words upon  the Wall see the Text  Dan  v  The King crye  aloud to bring in the  Astrologers  the  Chaldeans  an  the  Southsayers  to read the Writing  Why were these call'd but as they were Men of Fame for thei  Learning in reading strange Characters Men o  Skill in Languages and Books which in those Days the common People knew little or nothing of  Well all the learned Men of the Kingdom were accordingly call'd together but none of them could answer the End no notwithstanding all the great Rewards promis'd them Ver  Then came in a  the King's wise Men  that is to say the  Flamsteads  the  Sir Isaacs  the  Halleys  the  Whistons  c o  the Age  but they could not read  the Writing  c  And what follows  Then was King  Belshazzar  greatly troubled and his Countenance was chang'd in him  Nor is that all but the Text adds  and his Lords were astonied    It seems they thought those  wise Men  knew every thing that they had been able to understand all the Languages in the World and that therefore if they could not read it it must be something supernatural something from above or something from below which was worse And in those Cases indeed they did not expect the wise Men should read it for they did not suppose those wise Men corresponded with the Devil or had an evil Spirit They thought indeed if it depended upon human Understanding they could do it but as to higher things than those they did not expect them so the King and his Lords began to be the more surpriz'd at it But now see the th Verse The Queen directs them to enquire out  Daniel  and send for him and tells them he would certainly read the Writing and tell them the Meaning or Interpretation of it See the Words at large  Now the Queen by reason of the words of the King and his Lords came to the banquethouse and the Queen spake and said O King live for ever let not thy thoughts trouble thee nor let thy countenance be changed  There is a man in thy kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy Gods and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the Gods was found in him whom the King  Nebuchadnezzar  thy Father the King I say thy Father made Master of the Magicians Astrologers Chaldeans and Soothsayers    Forasmuch as an excellent spirit and knowledge and understanding interpreting of dreams and shewing of hard sentences and dissolving of doubts were found in the same  Daniel  whom the King named  Belteshazzar  now let  Daniel  be called and he will shew the Interpretation    After this Story no Man need enquire what the World understood by the  Magicians  and  Astrologers  and  wise Men  of those Days But 'tis plain they were look'd upon not as dealers with the Devil but as Men inspir'd from Heaven fill'd with inspir'd Knowledge Light and Understanding and excellent Wisdom that they could make Interpretations resolve Doubts  c  as ver of the same th Chapter And as such the Princes and Lords of the Country apply'd to them in all difficult and extraordinary Cases  Now 'tis true we have only Examples of the Kings and Princes making use of these People in difficult Cases as  Pharaoh Nebuchadnezzar Belshazzar  But 'tis not to be doubted that the People in general of all Qualities and Conditions went to them to be resolv'd in their Doubts and to have Questions answer'd them in difficult Cases in short this was their general Employment and they made a Trade of it  On this Account we find in several ancient Writings that the Southsayers were made use of to interpret Dreams and foretel things to come to represent good or bad Omens and give their Opinions upon the Appearances of any extraordinary Phaenomena in Nature Thus you have  Julian  the Apostate reproach'd with encouraging such Men and listning to them some Ages after this when their Reputation was sunk to a lower degree by far than it was at in former Times  This being then the Case we are not to talk of the  Magick  of those Ages or of the People call'd  Magicians  in the present vulgar Acceptation of the Word but they are to be understood to be what  Solon Plato Seneca Aristotle  or any of the best and brightest of the Philosophers of afterAges were known to be namely Men of Learning who had apply'd themselves to the study of Virtue and to the Knowledge of and Search into the most hidden treasures of Nature who understood the Reasons of things the Causes and Originals of the most retir'd and difficult Accidents in Nature that search'd into and calculated all Astronomical Difficulties the Motions and Revolutions of heavenly Bodies and as I said before their Influences on things below that studied and found out the physical Virtues of Plants Metals Minerals and in a word every difficult thing either in natural or experimental Philosophy  These were the  Magicians  of those Days and to write a System of  Magick  as it was then practis'd and is to this Day understood to be the first meaning of it would be to write a System of natural Philosophy only with this specifick Difference namely that with the utmost of their Search the highest of their  Reach  and the greatest of their Understandings they knew so little of every thing or indeed of any thing that the wisest of their  wise Men the most accomplished  Magician  or  Chaldean  in all the  Egyptian  or  Chaldean  Courts could not pretend to know what our present Pupils in Science come to the understanding of in the first Lectures of Philosophy which they go thro' in a Course of Academick Study  Their Conceptions of things were rough and rude what they entertain'd was either receiv'd by the Instruction of others as by oral Tradition from the like  wise Men  that went before them or from the dark Conjectures of their own reasoning and enquiring Dispositions join'd perhaps to some few and those but very mean Experiments of their own making from Observation and Reflection  These first Lights burnt very dim in their Understandings and gave but little helps to them in their Search after Knowledge but still as the rest of the World was infinitely darker and more ignorant also than they are now so this dim Light and these glimmerings of Knowledge appear'd to them in proportion to the Light they had to judge by as bright and shining as the greatest and most consummate Knowledge does now to us in the Heads of a  Boyle  a  Newton  or the most exquisite and best accomplish'd Philosophers of the Age  All things in Nature are great or little in their Appearances in Proportion to those proper Objects which they are to be consider'd with or measur'd by The Earth it self is consider'd as a vast Globe of solid Substances form'd into one Body by an infinitely powerful Hand when on the one hand it is measur'd by any particular Bodies either Part of it self or of any other Body which are small and as it may be said inconsiderable in Bulk compar'd to it Whereas on the other hand that very Globe or vast Body which we call this  Earth  is but as a Point a Mote or a grain of  Dust when consider'd with and measur'd by the immense Bodies of the Comets the Sun the fix'd Stars or other those glorious Luminaries which we see rang'd above us and out of the reach even almost of our Conceptions  Thus the Knowledge and Acquirement of the  Magicians  and wise Men in the first Ages of Time and of whom I have been now speaking tho' mean and trifling superficial and of little Worth when compar'd with the accomplish'd and consummate Wisdom of the Moderns their experimental Philosophy their Knowledge in Astronomy their Improvement of Nature and Art yet it was Great and worthy of Admiration when compar'd in those Days to what the rest of Mankind knew and look'd upon by and compar'd with an ignorant Age such as that was and therefore the King tells  Daniel  that an  Excellent Spirit of Wisdom was found in him  Dan v And doubtless the People look'd upon  Daniel  to be inspir'd with Wisdom and Knowledge from the  holy Gods  that is to say from Heaven  as indeed he was  tho' not from their dumb Idols whom they called by the Name of the  Holy Gods    In like manner tho' perhaps not with so strong a Conviction they had an Opinion of all those they call'd the  Chaldeans  and  Southsayers Magicicians  and  Astrologers  that they had secret Communication with their Gods and that they receiv'd all the Knowledge with which they were inspir'd and in which they so much excell'd the rest of Mankind from the several Deities which they worshipp'd I will not deny but that those  Magicians  might endeavour by many Subtilties and Arts to confirm and preserve the delusion for they knew it to be so in the Minds of the People that they might also work up the Veneration of the deluded Multitude to a due Height and preserve the Opinion  both of their Persons and of their Capacities and this perhaps will appear when further enquir'd into to be the Foundation of all the wicked things which follow'd as I shall demonstrate in its Order  It was really a Temptation to those  wise Men  as they were called to see that the World had a vast Opinion of them while the World was blind and in the Infancy of their own Understanding a little matter would impose upon them but in process of things the World grew wiser and the light Nature began to receive Illuminations from the light of Reason and then it behov'd the wise Men to see that their Knowledge also encreased in Proportion for still they were obliged to keep the Reputation of their Understandings by passing from one Study to another and aspiring still higher and higher in their several Classes of Improvement  Now this it was easie to do in all those early Days of Knowledge Nay they had a thousand Years before them still in which a moderate Competence of acquir'd Knowledge would keep up their Characters what Course was taken afterwards we shall see by and by  To sum it up then in few Words a  Magician  in the first Ages of the World was nothing more or less than a Man of Learning only you must take this with you as you go that by the Word  Learning  is to be understood not a Man of  Letters  and  Books  for the World knew little of either in the first Days of those Acquirements Nay we have reason to be assur'd that the Knowledge of Letters was not arriv'd in the World at the time when  Pharaoh  summon'd the wise Men and the Southsayers and Magicians to interpret his Dream and as they had no Letters they had no Books and therefore when 'tis said that  Moses  was learned in  all the Wisdom of the  Aegyptians  it must be un+derstood of oral Learning Wisdom convey'd to hi  by Observation or Instruction or Inspiration a  afterwards he really receiv'd it from Heaven  The Magicians I say were Men of Learning that is to say Men of Study Men of Observation busy in the search after Knowledge and if we wil  take Pains to enquire into it we shall find thei  Observations chiefly respected the Motions of the heavenly Bodies the Aspects and Influences of the Planets and fix'd Stars and considering that they were absolutely without the help of Instrument and Glasses to make their Observations by an  without Books by which to communicate the Knowledge of one Age or of one Person to another I say considering these things were wanting 'tis a wonderful thing that they arriv'd to such a Degree of astronomical Knowledge as they did  Others studied the Knowledge of Nature in the Constitution and Contexture of human Bodies the Originals the Progress and the causes of Diseases and Distempers both in Men and Women and also the physical or medicinal Virtue of Drugs and Plants for Cure and Ease of those Diseases the qualities of the several Herbs and Trees and Productions of the Earth and as in these things they made daily Discoveries in Nature which the World was till then ignorant of and by which they perform'd surprizing Cures and deliver'd the distressed People in divers Maladies they were on that Account and deservedly too had in great Esteem were reverenc'd and even worship'd by the People  I could give many Examples in History from the most ancient Times when their Physicians and Astronomers were after their Decease rank'd among their Gods and doubtless were had in a profound Veneration while they were living  In a word Science and useful Knowledge being young in the World those Men who gave themselves up to the first Searches after those things were thought worthy of the greatest Honours and were had in the greatest Esteem indeed they very well deserv'd of Mankind since they gave such noble Testimonies of their being devoted to the Publick good Thus  Prometheus  who is said to be chain'd down to Mount  Caucasus  with a Vulture preying upon his Bowels the Substance or Meaning of which was no more than this That he gave himself so entirely up to the Study of Astronomy and to search after the Knowledge of the heavenly Motions that the eager Desire after the Knowledge of them gnaw'd into his very Vitals consum'd his Natural Strength and proved fatal to his Health and that this was upon Mount  Caucasus  intimated only that he chose a high Hill or a Summit among those Mountains where he used to lye on his Back whole Nights together to make his Observations more exactly of the revolving Motions of the Stars till he contracted Distempers by the Colds and Damps of the Air so that he was as it were chain'd down to those Mountains till the Diseases he contracted eat out his very Bowels  This is that  Prometheus  who for his exquisite Knowledge is feign'd by the Poets to have first form'd Man that is to say form'd the Model of a Man by the help of Water and Earth and then stole Fire from the Sun to animate the Model and to give him Life and Motion  The Meaning of which is no more than this that by his Wisdom he instructed and form'd the Minds of Men in true Notions and right Knowlege of the most sublime Objects  Prometheus  first as ancient Authors say  First made the Model of a Man in Clay  Form'd all the beauteous Parts and when he'd done  Stole vital Heat from the prolific Sun  And here by the way the first Atheists the  Epicureans  and others who shew'd their mighty Willingness to deny a First Cause a Being Prior and therefore Superior to all Beings would make Man to be the Author of his own Form and Life and that  Prometheus  having thus form'd the Model and by borrowing Fire from the Sun given it Life the newform'd Creatures had ever since communicated that Life by Generation But this empty Notion stands confuted most effectually by only joyning the following four Lines to those above  But not an Author tells us to this Day  Who made  Prometheus  first and who the Clay  Who gave the Great Prolific to the  Sun  And where the first Productive Power begun  But to leave Moralizing which my merry Readers seem to have an Aversion to I go on with my Story  The learned Sir  Walter Raleigh  says they are greatly mistaken who think that the Thing as well as the Word  Magick  is derived from  Simon Magus  He adds that  Simon  's Name was not  Magus  a Magician but  Goes  a Person familiar with evil Spirits and that he only usurp'd the Title of  Simon the Magician  because the Title of a  Magician  was honourable and good and my Opinion is thus strengthen'd by his Authority  viz  that there is a manifest difference between  Magick  which is Wisdom and  supernatural Knowledge and the Witchery and Conjuring by which we now understand the Word and use it accordingly  I join with this Exposition of the Word  Magick  and shall therefore carefully distinguish as I go along betwixt the several differing Persons known in History for  Magi Magicians  and Professors or Practisers of  Magick  and those  Magicians  by which we are to understand Sorcerers and Enchanters and Dealers with the Devil of whom nevertheless I shall have occasion frequently to speak in this Work because though I shall let you know that the  Magicians  were not all Sorcerers and DevilDealers yet I must also let you know too that I am to point the main of this Discourse to such as are so  Nor is this previous determining the Point any thing less than necessary at this time with respect to the Variety of worthy Gentlemen our present Contemporaries in fashionable Wisdom who however willing they are to be taken for  Magicians  even in the very worst Sense of the Word rather than not to pass for Conjurers must be vindicated even against their Wills if it be only upon the single Consideration of Incapacity since as none of the  Magi  of the World were famed for wanting Brains so the  Devil  having no occasion for Fools in the natural Sense will always disown them in spite of the strongest Pretences they make to his Service  In justice therefore to those  Wou'dbewitches  I must clear the way as I go and openly distinguish between  Magicians  understanding them as wise and learned Men or  Magicians  understanding them as BlackArt Men and FOOLS that are only not  Sorcerers  because the Devil does not think it worth his while to employ them and in short that they are incapable of being as wicked as they would be  The Word  Magus  from whence the Words  Magick  and  Magician  are derived is a  Persian  or perhaps  Chaldean  Term used originally to signify a Student in Divinity a Man conversant in divine Studies and  Plato  says the Art of  Magick  is nothing but the Knowledge of the Worship of the Gods and the  Persians  called their Gods  which Exposition of the Word is agreeable to that of  Mat  ii there came  wise Men of the East  who having seen the Star of him that was born King of the  Jews  came so far  to worship him    These wise Men the  Greeks  afterwards called Philosophers that is Lovers of Wisdom and the same is understood in the  Indian  Language by  Brachmans  and now  Bramines  by the  Babylonians Chaldeans  by the  Hebrews Seers  and among the  Persians Magicians    It is true as King  James  I says in his Book of  Daemonologie  that under the name of Magick all other unlawful Arts are comprehended but that is only as we Moderns understand it not that it was understood so by the Ancients and even in that the King distinguishes between Magick in its worst Sense and the Arts or Practices of Witchcraft and Sorcery which with his Majesty's Leave I think a needless Distinction Nor shall I be so nice but all those Dealings which we call  Necromancy Sorcery Witchcraft  and all kinds of diabolical doings shall pass with me for  Magick  and the  BlackArt  and in this Sense I shall afterwards use the Word  The wise Men of  Babylon  are distinguish'd in the Prophecy of  Daniel  into four Classes the Magicians that is the wise Men in the Sense as above I mean Philosophers the  Astrologers  which are understood the same with our Astronomers and with them Southsayers the third sort are the  Sorcerers  who were called  Malefici  or Workers of Evil or  Mischief as some call them these are the kind I am to treat of who are Workers of Evil by the Assistance of an evil Spirit and the last are called  Chaldaeans  by which are understood Foretellers of things to come who understand their hidden and secret Causes  This Exposition brings us down to the Case in hand where by the Word or Term of  Magick  is understood the two last sorts who working Evil of several kinds do it also by the Assistance of an evil Spirit that is in  English  by the Help of the Devil by Inchantment Conjurations and corrupt Methods  The Practices of these People were many ways Diabolical even in those days and if we may credit King  James  's Account of them they were rather worse in those latter Ages of the World than in former times but of that in its Place  Philo Judaeus  carries it further than any of the most antient Writers and Sages and says that by this kind of  Magick  that is by  Astrology  and Observation of the heavenly Bodies their Motions and Revolutions  Abraham  who was certainly a very great  Magician  arriv'd to the Knowledge of the true GOD even before he came out from UR  of the Chaldees  that is to say he gather'd from the wise Government the wonderful Order and Motion and the immovable Decrees and Revolutions of the heavenly Bodies that there must be an infinite wise and intelligent Being who as he was the first Cause of their Beings so he was likewise the great Director of their Motions and by his Appointment every thing in the whole System of their Operations was guided and appointed In short that  Abraham  learn'd to know the Creator by the Contemplation of the Creature And doubtless as this study of Nature directly leads us to the great Author of Nature so  Abraham  by his sincere Application to the first  and his sincere Desire to be led into the Number of the last GOD who knew those Desires of his Heart to be sincere and aiming at a right end was pleased to make a more clear Discovery of himself to him by Vision and Revelation teaching him more than he could ever have obtain'd by all the Study and Application imaginable  It is not doubted however that  Abraham  was the first teacher of Astronomy and of Arithmetick in the World and perhaps of the several Branches of the Mathematicks The Ancients affirm that he taught the  Phoenicians  that is to say the  Canaanites  among whom he liv'd and the  Egyptians  also all the Knowledge they had whether Philosophical or Divine  Thus then whatever Notions we have now entertain'd of  Magick  as Diabolical yet certainly as our Saviour says in another Case  in the beginning it was not so  In the first Ages of the World the Knowledge of  Magick  was the Wisdom of Nature and nothing but Ignorance brought Men to prostitute themselves to the Devil for the encrease of their Understandings  And this indeed is the way by which  Magick  and the Knowledge of the most excellent things has been abus'd in the World when Men seeking beyond themselves for Knowledge and ignorant of the way to increase true Knowledge have been impos'd upon to make use of wicked and diabolical Methods to obtain it the Devil not only readily concurring to assist them but openly acting with them by Concert to encourage the Delusion  Hence the weakest and most impotent of all Capacities meer Fools excepted have been found sufficient to make Tools for the Devil who hard+ening them for his own Work trains them up to his Hand with such an unwearied Diligence tha  nothing can prevent their improving in his Service  Thus while  Magick  is the Wisdom of Nature and the  Magicians  of those Ages were the wisest and best of Men the  Magicians  of our times and of this new kind improve from nothing begin with the vilest of Ignorance and proceed to the vilest of Wickedness till they come to be the most Diabolical Creatures in the World  Magick being therefore nothing in those Times but as I have said a degree of useful Knowledge and the  Magicians  being a Race of honest studious Men searching after Wisdom and blest with greater Shares of it than the ordinary Race of Men were arriv'd to we must look farther and come down lower into Time for the present vulgar Acceptation of the Word In which Inquiry it will not be sufficient to jump at once from the beginning of things to the present times and from what the  Magicians  were in  Egypt  and  Chaldea  to what they are now in a Christian Age But we must a little enquire into the Gradations of the Change and see by what several Progressions of Art the useful  Magicians  of those Ages have come on from meer Philosophy to all the Extraordinaries of Mystery Cunning Trick Cheat Stargazing Fortunetelling Conjuring Witchcraft and the Devil and if this be not an Enquiry both profitable and diverting I must be mistaken in my Subject or in my Readers Let us enter into it gradually and with Caution lest we raise the Devil before we come at him  CHAP II  How Wisdom and Learning advanc'd Men in the First Ages to Royalty and Government and How Many of the Magicians were made Kings on that Account as  Zoroaster Cadmus  and many others  IT was not many Ages that the World continued in a state of Dullness equal to that at the first scattering the Nations We do not find them building any more  Babels  or entertaining themselves with such gross Notions any more  As they travell'd abroad they learned Experience they saw farther into Nature and into the Reason of Things instead of building Ladders and  Babels  to reach up to Heaven and keep them from drowning they soon learnt to build Cities to keep out their Enemies and Ships to sail upon the Water they baffled the Fears of another Deluge not by their Faith that God would not drown the World again so much as by the belief of this Whymsy that seeing they could swim in Ships and Boats he could not do it or that knowing they could live upon the Water they might seem not to care whether he did or no  In this travelling Circumstance they grew in Knowledge as I say and  at least  some of them being of a brighter Genius than others advanc'd beyond their Neighbours in Wisdom and Understanding both speculative and practical and these as they gain'd every Day more Knowledge even by knowing so that Knowledge gain'd them infinite Applause and Esteem among the People  Hence every aspiring Genius among them getting the start of the rest either in real or affected Knowledge of things and thereby gaining Admirers and Dependents took little differing Routs  in their Wanderings and wherever they thought fit to plant and settle they built Houses call'd it a City and the Leader made himself be call'd their particular King  This petty Royalty as it was rais'd upon the foot of Chance rather than Blood and upon the mean Circumstance of a bold aspiring Head which a small share of Brains above its Neighbours gave a Title to so it seem'd to subsist on the foot of the same Chance those Kings being as easily and as often depos'd as they were either overpower'd by their Neighbours or as any Decay and Defect of the bright Part that rais'd them caus'd them to sink in the Opinion of their Subjects and gave the King of the next City a better Place in their Favour  Yet this Diminutive Rank of Soveraignty remain'd many Ages in the World and we find not only in  Abraham  's Time when the five Cities of the Lake or Valley where  Sodom  stood had five Kings over them and afterwards in  Jacob  's time the City of  Sichem  had a King over it but even at the coming of the  Israelites  into  Canaan  almost every City had its King and we have a great deal of room to judge that these Kings did not derive from a patriarchal Succession for then there would have been many thousands of Kings more than there were but from the exalted Merit of the Understandings and Genius of such and such a Person whom the People thought fit to admire and follow and consequently subject themselves to and we have abundance of Examples in History to prove that this was the practice of those first Ages But this is a dry Study and the Search after their Names would be as needless as the List when obtain'd would be tedious to read so I leave it and go on  The reason of my naming this Part is not to show the Veneration the most early Ages of the World had for Wisdom and Virtue for  God knows  these  Magi  tho' they had the Merit of some  Knowledge above the rest yet we do not find they had a much greater Share of Virtue than other People But even as we find it now the most knowing Men are not the best Men even so it was then every wise Man much less every great Man was not a good Man and as in our Age it may be fear'd we have more Clergy than Christians so there were in those Days more Sages than Saints till at last their wise Men turn'd whimsical their Kings Madmen their Southsayers meer Conjurers and their Magicians Devils Of all which I shall give a farther Account presently  I'll suppose now that the  Magicians  of those Ages were as I have describ'd them in the Chapter before nothing but Men fam'd for extraordinary Knowledge meer Astrologers Philosophers Men of Study and the like You will next see how those Men frequently rais'd their Fortunes by their Wisdom or rather by the Opinion which the ignorant World had of their Wisdom and Capacities  Zoroaster  was a famous  Magician  in the Sense which I have already given of the word History tells us he was a great Astrologer and foretold things by his Art which were to come that by his wonderful Predictions he obtain'd such a Veneration among the People that the  Bactrians  ador'd him as a Man sent down from the Gods or if you like it as well in Scripture Terms as a  Man of GOD  and by this mighty Opinion which they had of him he obtain'd the Empire of the  Bactrians  This must be at the time when  Ninus  was Monarch of  Assyria  for he was afterwards conquer'd dispossess'd of his Dominions and slain by  Semiramis  that warlike Widow Queen of  Assyria    They report that he foretold he should be slain by Lightning or by the Fire of Heaven and that he told the  Assyrians  that if they could find his Ashes they should carefully preserve them for  that their Empire should continue no longer than while his Ashes should remain in Being that afterward it fell out accordingly that he was kill'd by Lightning and that the  Assyrians  did so preserve his Ashes but that they were afterwards taken from them by the  Persians  who overthrew their Empire  NB  All this is summ'd up thus in fact That  Zoroaster  left behind him wholsome Rules of Virtue and good Government which as long as the  Assyrians  kept in Memory and worthily follow'd they were prosperous as he foretold them they would be but when afterwards they degenerated into Vice and ceased to obey the Rules which he had set them they fell into Divisions and Factions Civil Wars and Devastations which at length ended in the Ruin of their Empire  Cadmus  mention'd before was a  Phoenician  but went from his own Country and settled in  Greece  where as they say he built the City of  Thebes  and was made King of it in consequence of the Performance and in Veneration of his Learning having brought sixteen Letters of the  Greek  Alphabet among them not that he invented those Letters tho' he has the Fame of it to this Day the Letters were these α β γ δ ε ι η κ λ ν ο π ζ σ τ υ the other four θ ξ φ χ they tell us were afterwards supply'd by  Palamedes  during the Siege of  Troy    But the Moral of the Story is this that  Cadmus  came from  Phoenicia  into  Greece  where by his Learning he instructed the People civiliz'd and polish'd their Manners and taught them the Knowldge of Letters directed them to build Houses and inhabit together in Towns and Villages which they then called Cities and in a word introduc'd among them Discipline and good  Government in Recompence for which the made him their King and call'd their first Tow  Thebes  in Honour of  Cadmus  who was originall of the Great  Egyptian Thebes  a City much mo  ancient than the Nation of the  Graecians    Atlas  also mention'd before was an  Africa  conspicuous for his Excellence in all human Wi  +dom and Knowledge by this he was raised to suc  a height in the Affection of the People that the made him King of  Mauritania  in the Norther  Part of  Afric  He was one of the most learne  Magicians  of the Time and by his Knowledge i  the Motions of the Stars and his excellent Judg+ment in the good Government of Nations he  feign'd by the Ancients to carry the World upo  his Shoulders that is to say his Precepts of Govern+ment supported the Nations and preserv'd Ord  and Discipline in the World and for this he wa  as he well deserv'd chosen by the People of  A  to be their King  I have done with my Examples of wise Men be+ing made Kings especially being made so for the Wisdom too and indeed to what purpose shoul  I go on with the Account 'tis not pretended th  Example should move the World in this Age o  in the next the World at present has no gre  occasion for more wise Kings than they have an  besides as there is a right wise Generation risin  up to supply the Place of Power as fast as Natu  wears off the Incumbents and we see no Danger o  wanting a suitable Succession so I leave that pa  of the Subject and shall talk of another Class  The  Magicians  or  wise Men  being as I have th  describ'd Men of Worth and justly valued in th  World let us see how long they held it and ho  they lost that Character  The first step which I meet with which lesse  their Figure in my Account was when the  Ma  or  wise Men  were called in to support the Government of the  Persian  Empire And here they shew'd indeed that Wisdom is not the only Qualification of a Prince that there is another thing requisite which tho' it is but trifling indeed among the Moderns was an Essential among the Ancients who found that to make a good Governor it was requisite that he should not only be a Wise Man but an Honest Man and in defect of this Qualification the  Persians  cut the Throats of all the  Magi  to whom they had committed the Government of the Country for tho' they were all Philosophers and wise Men yet as Fame hands it down to us they did not find one honest Man among them  These  Magi  are called by some Priests by others Philosophers by others Astrologers it is certain they foretold things to come or at least made the People believe so as in the Case of the Queen of  Persia  Mother of King  Sapores  The  Persians  it seems were in great Perplexity for want of a King there were no  Pretenders  at that time to put in their Claim a thing which very seldom happens in our times The Nobility being assembled in order to consider of a Nomination the  Magi  sent them word that they should not proceed for that the Queen Dowager was with Child and would bring forth a Prince who should be a mighty King and do great things for the Honour of his Country  Upon this their Consultations broke off and with great Joy they sent for the Queen and laying the Crown upon her Belly they solemnly crown'd the Embrio gave it the Title of King and saluted it King by the Name of  Sapor  or  Sapores  all which came to pass And yet I may say all this might come to pass and no great matter owing to the Prophetic Knowledge of the  Magi  for the Queen loth to have a King chosen too soon before she knew how  it was with her might venture to say she was with Child or at least get the Priests the  Magi  to say so for her and leave the rest all to Fate for if it had not prov'd so no body was injur'd and it would only have been said that the  Magi  were mistaken  But we are if you please to suppose that as I said this did not last long the lowpriz'd Learning of the  Magicians  answer'd very well while the World was ignorant in Proportion but as the World encreased in People and as Years went over their Heads Knowledge had its Gradations too and tho' it must be confess'd it was at a very slow Rate yet some advances they did make and as Princes severally were lovers of Learning so they encouraged Men of Learning too and their Numbers encereas'd as well as their Knowledge  As the common People became more knowing and intelligent so it behov'd the  Magicians  to advance their Studies and seek farther into the more sublime Parts of Learning to preserve the Distance they stood in from the lower Class of their Countrymen and to maintain the Respect and Veneration which as I said the People had for them i  they had not done this they had soon been upo  a Level with the rest of Mankind the Rabbl  had been their Equals in Wisdom and they ha  lost themselves in the superior Station of  Magici+ans  which they enjoy'd before  This put them presently upon searching farthe  and farther into the Arcana of Nature pursuing the highest and most elevated Studies with th  utmost Diligence and Application advancin  from one thing to another still to keep up th  Figure and Character of  wise Men  which they ha  before that is to say being still as many degree above the common sort however the common for might be improv'd in Knowledge as they were be+fore  Nor was this difficult to do for as Knowledge was then and even is still an unexhausted Mine and Storehouse of unvaluable Treasure and which still the deeper it is dug into discovers more and more Riches and an infinite variety of Rarities and curious things as well natural as artificial so the farther these Men of Application search'd into the Arcana or conceal'd Treasures of Wisdom and the farther and greater Experiments they made the more they found the Search answer their utmost Ambition the more they knew the more they discover'd yet to know and all their Enquiries made good the modern Distich made upon a like Subject  What's yet discover'd only serves to show  How little's known to what there's left to know  This was not only an Encouragement to the  wise Men  of the Ages we speak of to go on in their Studies and in their making new Discoveries in the hidden and most retir'd parts of Nature but it shew'd that they were still able to maintain the Characters they bore in the World and to make good the Distinction which was formely made between them and the common People so that they still pass'd for  Magicians wise Men  and Astrologers as they really at last were and for Men qualify'd to instruct the ignorant World in a superior Knowledge  Take them then in this new Situation that is to say pushing on in the commendable search after Wisdom and Knowledge till as  Solomom  says they dug for it  as for hid Treasures  yet the common People follow'd them close at their Heels the Nations grew wiser and wiser as well as the  Magi  till in short Art began to fail or rather the Numbers of the Men of Art began to encrease that so  wise Men  were not such Rarities or so highpriz'd  as they had been and grew daily less and less it the ordinary Rate and Esteem of the World  Thus in short the  wise Men  and the improving World seem'd like Men running a Race in the pursuit after Knowledge the  Magi  or Southsayers or what you please to call them had gotten the Start and were a great way ahead a great way before the rest but the People follow'd and advanc'd at a great Rate  And this brings me down to the Point  The Men of Wit and Learning being hard pu  to it in their new Discoveries had but three ways to preserve the Dignity of their Profession and keep up their Credit as  wise Mine  that is as Philosophers  Magi  and the like  The first was to pursue vigorously the Study of Philosophy that is to say of Nature the several Branches of  Astronomy Astrology Geometry  and the like  The second was to push into the Study of Art that is to say Experimental Philosophy  The last was the Study of Reason  viz  Natural Homage and the Worship of the Gods  In the first of these they went on with great Success nor were they to be follow'd by the common People whose Understandings could never come up to any uncommon degrees of Science or indeed to make any Pretensions to it and therefore those that apply'd to this Study kept up their Credit longer than any of the rest  Thus the three wise Men of the East are said to come into  Judaea  from a far Country by observing an unusual and surprizing Phaenomenon  viz  a Star at Noonday moving in a particular Orbit and pointing to them in a very particular Manner by which they were as it seems directed to follow it in order to make an extraordinary Discovery of some great Birth and of some wonderful Prince  whom therefore they ought to come and pay Homage to Some Authors tell us these three  wise Men  or  Magi  were three of the Posterity of  Abraham  by  Keturah  his last Wife that they dwelt in  Arabia Felix  and that they had it revealed to them that they should see this Star and that they should be guided by it to see the Great  Messiah  who was to come into the World to unite the Posterity of  Abraham  and to establish them in one Kingdom which should rule over the whole World But I take this as it is  viz  a Chimney corner Tale fit for a Legend and not capable of any manner of Improvement  But thus far 'tis to my Purpose namely that the Credit of the  wise Men  of the East was not yet quite sunk in the World that they maintain'd a Correspondence with the Stars that they por'd upon the heavenly Motions and knew more of that kind than all that ever went before them  As the Astronomers and Stargazing  Magi  kept up the Dignity of their Characters and outdid all the rest of Mankind in those Ages so the second sort too apply'd themselves to the Study of lower Life observing the Mechanism of Nature and introducing the helps of Art even to perform things surprising Among these some studied the Microcosm of human Bodies and searcht both Distemper and Medicin and these that is to say the Physicians and Naturalists obtain'd a noble Ascendant in the Esteem of the Vulgar being able by the Knowledge of Drugs and Plants and their Vertues to apply proper Remedies in Cases of the greatest Distress and Disaster and this indeed could not but obtain for them a fix'd and large Esteem in the Minds of the People whom on so many Occasions they reliev'd Thus the first search'd into the Curiosities of Nature the second into the Art of Physick  But the third were a very particular kind indeed and these apply'd themselves to the Arcana of things  Divine  and at this Door came in all the wicked things which have since with so much Justice too given a black Character to the very Name of a  Magician  for under the shelter of Religion the worst and most Diabolical things were practis'd and in a few Ages more we find that all the  Magicians  were Priests in  Aegypt  or according to some all the Priests were  Magicians  Some have offer'd a  drawing a Paralel from this to our times and i  some Sense it may be true but in others doubtful  For if by  Magicians  we are to understand Philosophers and wise Men I shall never be brought to acknowledge that all our Priests are  Magicians  fo  I abhor all Slander But to go back to the Case as it is before me certain it is that the  wise Me  finding as above that they must take new Measures that they must have Recourse to some new Art if they would keep up the Reputation of thei  Wisdom I say finding it thus they apply'd themselves to three sorts of Study  The first was to innocent Art secret and cun+ning Contrivances to delude the Sight this w  call Juggling Legerdemain or philosophical Delu+sion such as I shall mention in its Place but thi  would go but a little way  A second sort as above apply'd to religious Frauds and set up for Coelestial Delusions mixing thei  Magical Performances with religious Rites so deceiving the People with the Opinion of Sanctity and with the Belief that they had the Assistance o  the Gods  In Nomine Domini incipit omne malum  These last studied indeed Divinity such as it was and how unhappily did they pursue the Mysterie  they profess'd for first we find they invoked the Gods and not finding that would do they chang'd Hands and invoked the Devil  Flectere si nequeo superos Acheronta movebo  From hence it is that I suppose our wise Describers of the Magick of the Ancients tell us there were three sorts of  Magick  Natural which consisted of the Parts already mentioned namely the Knowledge of the Stars the Motions of the Heavenly Bodies and their Revolutions and Influences that is to say the Study of Nature of Philosophy and Astronomy Artificial or rational Magick in which they included the Knowledge of all judicial Astrology the casting or calculating Nativities curing Diseases by Charms by particular Figures placed in this or that Position by Herbs gather'd at this or that particular Crisis of Time and by saying such and such Words over the Patient repeated so many times and by such and such Gestures stroking the Flesh in such and such a manner and innumerable such like Pieces of Mimickry working not upon the Disease it self but upon the Imagination of the distemper'd People and so effecting the Cures by the Power of Nature tho' that Nature were set on work by the weakest and simplest methods imaginable But  dly  the last is truly called Diabolical and hellish Magick which was operated by and with the Concurrence of the Devil carried on by a Corspondence with evil Spirits with their Help Presence and personal Assistance and chiefly practised by their Priests And thus you have the general System of Magick according to my Title But I must enter a little into the Particulars  The first Sort of this Magick I have already described and I am still of this Opinion that in all the first Ages of the World there was very little other Magick than this known among Men That all the Diabolical Practices of the third Sort or the Art and Legerdemain of the second Sort of Magick was perfectly unknown to the Magicians of  Aegypt  or  Arabia  or afterwards of  Chaldea  at least for a great while  As for the Magicians of  Chaldea  I have named them already and we find nothing Diabolical among them as to those of  Aegypt  especially such as were ordinarily called so 'tis evident also they were generally the same for when  Pharaoh  King of  Aegypt  dreamed his first Dream of the seven fat and the seven lean Kine  Gen  xli the Words are express  ver    He sent for all the Magicians and all the wise Men of Aegypt  and what followed  there was none that could interpret  his Dream Upon which  Joseph  was sent for where by the way you may observe the difference between  Joseph  and the wise Men or Magicians let them be what they will The wise Men came when they were sent for and they put the King to the trouble of telling them his Dream and as we may believe went away to consult and consider of an Answer If they could have amused the King with any sham Answer so as to have quieted his Thoughts which were disturbed with the Oddness of the Appearance they would certainly have done it whence I conclude they were not either of the second sort of Magicians who by Trick and Charm muttering of Words drawing Figures and such empty and simple Formalities did their Work if they had they would certainly have cheated the King with some of their Impostures and Legerdemain and have made him accept of this or that wild Story for an Interpretation  Nor were they diabolical Magicians such as by a real and immediate Conversation with the Devil or some of his invisible Agents which we call evil Spirits wrought their usual Wonders or Delusions like Wonders and such as perhaps those afterwards made use of by another  Pharaoh  King of  Aegypt  really were who mimick'd the Miracles of  Moses  in the sight of the King and his Court If they had been such the Devil would not have suffer'd them to be so disgraced before their Lord as to go away and say they could make nothing of it nor give him the Interpretation the Devil would certainly have furnished them with some kind of Interpretation true or false at least such as should have satisfied the King for the present  NB  It is very reasonable to suggest here that these Magicians and wise Men of  Aegypt  and so those afterwards at  Babylon  had been usually called together before upon such Occasions as those that they had often interpreted Dreams perhaps for the King himself as well as for other People that sometimes they did perhaps make such Interpretations as came to pass by which they maintained much of their Reputation among the People as wise Men and as Magicians the same we see practised among us to this day by many an ignorant old Woman without the least Claim to the venerable Name of  Magician  much less of  Wise  also we cannot doubt but that the Kings of  Aegypt  and of  Babylon  did expect and believe those  Magicians  could interpret if they would it had been else a preposterous piece of Cruelty in  Nebuchadnezzar  to put all the  Magicians  and wise Men to death because they did not tell him his Dream and the Interpretation if he did really believe they were not able to do it for  'tis certain they did not pretend to be able t  tell the Dream tho' they did pretend to te  the Interpretation but he certainly believe they were able to do both  But when  Pharaoh  comes to talk with  Joseph  honestly tells the King it was not in him modest divesting himself of all Claim to the Honour whic  he foresaw was going to be put upon him an  giving up the Praise to the supream Agent t  whom it was due  v    It is not in me but G  shall give Pharaoh an Answer of Peace  and then goes on to interpret the Dream  I give you this as an Evidence of the Diffe+rence in the Kinds of Magick practised in tho  times the first Sort 'tis plain were as has bee  described meer Men of Learning Masters of Sc  +ence namely the Knowledge of Nature studyi  Philosophy Astronomy and the like some pract  +sing one way some another some looking up  +mong the Stars others down among the Plant some into the Microcosm of Man and practisi  Medicine for the Cure of Diseases some judgi  of Dreams and Omens others of Signs and Appe+rances and all according to their several Studie  and the several Branches of Science which they a  +plied themselves to but not any Sorcery or Dev  work among them at that time or for some hu  +dreds of Years after  But come now to the same Country  viz Aegyp  for here it seems the Devil began first to convert with Mankind or Mankind with him rather  this familiar manner I say come to the same Cou  +try at the distance of less than two hundred Year  or thereabout and there you find the  Magicia  turned into another sort of People or rather anoth  sort of People mix'd with them for when  Moses  an  Aaron  go to  Pharaoh  to demand the Liberty  the  Israelites  and show Miracles or Signs before him 'tis said  Pharaoh  sent for the Magicians  c  and they did the like  But then let us see how the Text distinguishes the kinds and you will find 'tis exactly according to my present distinction Before 'tis said  Pharaoh  sent for the Magicians and wise Men of  Aegypt  See  Gen  xli But now the Style is changed as the People were also  Exod  vii  Pharaoh  called the Sorcerers and Magicians of  Aegypt  and see then how they acted  ver    and the Magicians did the same with their Inchantments  and the like in several other Places so that here the Magicians and wise Men were of another sort for they acted by a Diabolical Practice as Sorcerers and Dealers with the Devil besides 'tis every where said they did it by their Inchantments which we never find so much as mentioned before no nor afterwards among the  Chaldeans  and the Magicians of  Persia  and  Assyria  but they acted by the meer Force of their Wisdom and Learning  viz  the Study of Nature and when that failed them they acknowledged they had no other Power and could go no farther  Now as I said before having pass'd thro' the best of the Art and the first and only honest Part of the Practice it follows that we consider the Subsequent Progressions of the People called Magicians what they have been understood to be what they now are in the World and what we are to understand by the Word when we say  Magick  or  a Magician  and this is  First  A Jugler or Shower of Tricks by Legerdemain and Slight of hand which I call only a sham Magick and which the World has been indeed deluded with for many Ages  Secondly  A real Sorcerer or Wizard that deals with the Devil who converses familiarly with the  old Gentleman has him at his Call fetches him sends him of Errands raises him lays him use him upon all Occasions and in all Disguises as he finds Occasion  That there have been such as these in the World must be true or History must be one universal Legend of Lies and we must have been deluded an  imposed upon by all the Writers and Register  keepers that ever have been were or are in Being nay even the sacred Writings confirm it and therefore with the Pardon of all our modern Unbelievers who deny there is such a thing as a  Devil  or evi  Spirit in Being either in the World or out of it I say with their good Leave I must take it fo  granted  Now  tho' I could bring many Examples among the Moderns where 'tis most certain that som  walking Gentlemen among us who have look'd a  if they had nothing in them more than other People  have really been a Cage of  Devils  and as the Tex  calls them Unclean Spirits yet I must at presen  look a little higher because I am resolved to bring such Evidence as cannot be denied  First  The Scripture says of  Judas  that with o  after the Sop the Devil enter'd into him  John  xiii  And after the sop Satan enter'd into him  that is into  Judas  and in the same Chap  v    the Devi  having put it into the heart of  Judas Iscariot Simon's Son  to betray him  and again St  Paul  speaking to  Elymas  whom the Text calls  in totidem verbis  the  Sorcerer  calls him  thou Child of the Devil  This and all the Testimonies of the Devil's being miraculously dispossess'd by our Saviour and by his Disciples and Apostles will put it out of question not only that there is such a thing as a  Devil  but also that he has Possession of several of his Servants in human Shape  But this is not the case at all for I am not now upon the Proof of the Reality and Existence of the  Devil  that has been worthily undertaken and historically mathematically and enthusiastically enough Perform'd by a late Writer in another Place But I am now talking of a Set of People who were not possess'd BY but rather as it may be called are possess'd OF the  Devil  have him in their keeping and Custody where by the way I do not find but that the  Devil  seems to be very much in Subjection to them whether it be voluntarily and so perhaps like an obsequious Dog that fawns for what he can get He the Devil creeps and cringes in order the better to carry on his own Designs which indeed is not at all improbable or whether there were Ways and Means which these antient People had found out by what superiour Power I know not to subject the Devil to their Orders and make him their humble Servant upon all Occasions to run and go fetch and carry at their whistle All these critical Enquiries may perhaps come in my way when I come to talk more particularly of the  Magick  of our present times and the Management of our modern Cunning Men who pretend to have the Devil in a String make him jump over a Broomstick dance and show Tricks as the Mountebanks and MerryAndrews do with a Bear and a Monkey  I must confess if I can but in my further Search after those things find out the Method the antient Magicians had to manage the  Devil  thus and bring him to their hand and can convey the Art to Posterity or at least set up a Scheme for the present Improvement of it I shall not doubt but I shall meet with Encouragement and if the eminent Mr  Whon  will but stoop to join in with my Design as I doubt not he will if there be but Money to be got by it we may publish our Readings  and set up Lectures for the Instruction of young Magicians and that with extraordinary good Success nor do I think the reverend Mr  Emin  would stick out for why should we doubt but they who have already levell'd their Saviour with a Class infinitely below the Devil and made a meer  Devil  or Apparition of the great Teacher and Sanctifier of the World would willingly set up Lectures in Favour of the  Devil  himself if they can find their account in it  Besides when we are thus engaged in Satan's Service and in Conjunction with his Friends and Favourites we cannot doubt but the  Devil  himself will be so much obliged that he may come frankly and Voluntier and let us into the Secret bind himself Apprentice to us for a Term of Years and enable us to play the Devil with him for the Time to come as he had played the Devil with us for so many Years past Nor if he be a grateful  Devil  can he do less for no Men in the World seem better qualified to advance his Interest in the main however for the present we may seem to keep him in a little Subjection  On the other hand if he should prove an ungrateful Spirit and hang an A as the Modest call it being unwilling to come into Bondage then I say we must try if we can't find the way to do it without him and by our  BlackArt  play the Devil with him and force him to come when he's called go when he is sent and do as he is bid as our Predecessors the antient Magicians of  Aegypt  did before us who made him assist  Moses  and  Aaron  and make Frogs and Snakes just as they directed him tho' it seems when they commanded him to make Lice the least and lousiest Creature of 'em all the honest  Devil  confess'd it was out of his Power that God was above the  Devil  and that in a Word  he could not do it  by which however  he lost a great deal of his Credit with his Employers and perhaps with the King himself  That the  Devil  assisted the Magicians of  Aegypt  to do those things or in short that they made use of him as their Instrument is plain from the Text  viz  that they did it by their Inchantments What manner of Conjurings or Inchantments they were that they made use of we have no particular light into from the sacred Text but perhaps some Guess may be made at it from what happen'd frequently in those Countries in afterAges  Also we find that whatever the Magicians in  Persia  and in  Media  and in those  Eastern  Countries were for their Credit continued many Ages yet in  Aegypt  they were after that chiefly Sorcerers and Dealers with the  Devil  and in a word  Aegypt  seem'd to be the Nursery of human  Devils  for all the World Hence  Baalim  is called a Witch and hence in the  Roman  times the  Aegyptian  Sorcerers were brought to  Antioch  for the Assistance of  Julian  the Apostate to utter Predictions and to flatter the Emperor with their good Omens and their Prognostications in which he was so superstitious that they put the grossest Delusions upon him 'till the Citizens of  Antioch  made a jest of him and exposed his Inchantments to Ridicule for which had he lived to come back from the War in  Persia  he had vowed a severe Revenge  Hence also the  Aegyptians  are to this day the common Strollers of the World and are succeeded by a Race of Vagabonds who pretend to the Art without the real Wickedness of it and would be thought to deal with the Devil when the Truth is they know little or nothing of him  I suppose I need not tell you that the Word  Gypsie  is derived from these strolling  Magicians  which really came out of  Aegypt  and wandering over the World got Money by their pretending  to Magick telling Fortunes predicting Events and Mountebanking the World with their Inchantments 'till at last having tired the Devil with following them and the Drudgery of their Service being not worth his while Satan left them and they have been since that for some time in the Class of the wellknown Cardinal who pretending to an Acquaintance with the Devil and to have three inferior Daemons appointed to wait on him the  Devil  sent those three Daemons to tell his Neighbours 'twas all a Cheat and that he  Satan  had nothing to do with him  'Tis very strange Men should be so fond of being thought wickeder than they are that they cannot forbear but that they must abuse the very Devil and claim Kindred of him whether he has any Knowledge of them or no But thus it is and we need not go to  Aegypt  for Examples when we have so many pieces of dull Witchcraft among our selves  It is true the  Devil  does not often decline an Acquaintance where he can find his Account in it and therefore the eminent Doctor may hope that after a little farther Application to Heresy and Blasphemy he may be thought worthy of Admittance into Satan's Favour at least so much as to settle a Correspondence that so they may act in concert for the future  I am told some have thought it a particular Reputation to them to have it supposed they maintain a Correspondence of this kind which must be upon the foot of Satan's Credit supposing that he knows who is fit for his Business and who not and that they must be all capable Heads that he thinks fit to be concerned with in this manner for as wise Princes always chuse wise Councellors the  Devil  understands the Capacities of his Friends so well that he is never mistaken in his choice  but they that are concerned with him must at least be of the Cunning Class for he has no Inclination at all to Fools  This brought some just Reflections into my Thought upon the Conduct of our Times and immediately cleared up the Characters of some of the greatest Politicians of our Age at least in my Opinion seeing 'tis evident they either have too much Brains or too little for the infernal Correspondence let the World judge which of the two is their Case  I say it cleared up the Character of some great Men to me and I concluded they were no Magicians that they neither practised Magick in the first Sense as Philosophers or in the last Sense as Conjurers what they might do in the middle Sense as Jugglers that remains to be enquired into as Opportunity may present  Indeed I run over in my Reflections the present Situation of most of the publick Affairs in  Europe  the Prime Ministers grand Viziers the Statesmen the Counsellors Generals Admirals the Clergy whether Popish or Protestant  Greek  Church or  Roman  Church Christian or Mahometan and I must speak it to their Honour that except as a late Writer taught me to except our own People our own Country and Country Worthies I can see no reason to think any of the present Managers to be  Magicians  whether as above we consider the Magicians to be Philosophers or as  Jannes  and  Jambres  Inchanters and Conjurers  But having spoken of the two several sorts of  Magick  Honest Magick which I have proved to be only the Study of natural Philosophy and Astronomy and such useful Parts of Knowledge which the Learned call Natural Magick and  dly  Diabolical or infernal Magick which is a practising by the Help of Daemons or evil Spirits  It remains then that I should at least mention the third or which before I placed as second in Order which is  Artificial Magick  that is to say a meer Legerdemain or Juggling with Nature This is managed by the Wit and Dexterity of Man with the Advantages of concealed occult Powers known in Nature but unknown and unseen by vulgar Heads and Eyes and such Fame tells us have been carried to extraordinary heights such as  The Glass Sphere of  Archimedes    The wooden Pidgeon of  Architas    The golden Birds of the Emperor  Leo  which sung  The brazen Birds of  Boetius  which did both sing and fly and his brazen Serpent which could hiss  To which we may add Fryar  Bacon  's brazen Head which spoke  These were all Impositions upon the Sight or Hearing of the People as no doubt the  Phosphorus  would have been which makes Fire burn without Heat and without consuming the Matter and had a Man in those days of Invention found out a  Loadstone  what Wonders might he not have performed by it what would have been said to see him make a piece of Iron dance round a Table while the Agent held the Magnet underneath make another piece of Iron touched with it suspend a third in the Air  and the like  make it draw one End of a Needle to it and then drive it from it again as the Poles of the Magnet were turned and directed Will any Man believe but he that first shewed these unaccountable things would have passed for a Magician a Dealer with the  Devil  nay or rather for a real  Devil  in human Shape  Whoever had first brought such a wonderful Stone into view as our ordinary Chalkstone calcin'd and turned into Lime supposing it never to have been  heard of before and shown with it the Rarity of its Operation  viz  that if you threw it into the Fire it would put the Fire out and if you put it into Water it would burn  These are some of the Delusions of Artificial  Magicians  and such as these the World has been full of till now we begin to be too Wise to be cheated any longer that way but as to Statejugglers the  Magick  of the Partymongers Religiousjugglers and the  Magick  of the Pulpit with divers other less fatal Kinds I believe they are at this time in the Meridian of their Practice and Success or near it what height they may go farther we do not indeed certainly know it must be left to Time  And thus you have an honest System of the Science called  Magick  according to the Title of this Undertaking  CHAP III  Of the Reason and Occasion which brought the ancient honest  Magi  whose original Study was Philosophy Astronomy and the Works of Nature to turn Sorcerers and Wizzards and deal with the Devil and how their Conversation began  HAVING thus stated the Fact and given you what I call a  System  of  Magick  'tis necessary now that in pursuance of my Title I should insist more particularly upon the third and last sort of  Magick  I mention'd and which is call'd  Diabolical  or according to the vulgar Acceptation the  Blackart  and bring it out to you from its very foundation  This must be deduced Historically from the other two or else I cannot lead you regularly into its Original or give you its true Description besides a great many useful and agreeable Speculations offer themselves in the rise and progress of the thing it self which will be most necessary to speak to as we go along  Magick  did not jump at once into Being as to the thing it self it was not a Revelation from Hell made at once to Mankind to tell them what they might do The Devil did not come and offer his Service  Gratis  to us and representing how useful a Slave he would be solicit us to take him into Pay and this at once without Ceremony or Introduction  No no  it was a long Progression of Studies and Improvement in wicked and mischievous Schemes that brought Mankind to have recourse to the Infernals to seek the Aid of the dark Agents below and to sollicit a Commerce of that kind Nor was this done till after finding many Difficulties in their other way they saw evidently they could not do without him could not accomplish their mischievous Desires by other Methods and that this way it was to be done  Not but that the Devil was very ready when he found himself made necessary I say he was very ready to come into the Schemes when propos'd and to serve us in our Occasion and that with a Willingness which was extreamly obliging which shew'd him to be a Person of abundance of Complaisance and mighty willing to engage us whatever it cost him as much as to say he was glad he could serve us was ready to do his utmost for us and the like  Now to go back briefly to the Occasion which brought the  Magicians  to the Necessity of seeking to him for Assistance and to take him into the Management of their Affairs the Case was in short  this The World as I have said already began to be wiser than the Ages before them the ordinary  Magick  of the former Ages would not pass any longer for Wisdom and if the wise Men  as they were called  did not daily produce some new Discoveries 'twas evident the Price and Rate of  Southsaying  would come down to nothing  If this put them upon Stratagem and Art in order to keep up their Credit and maintain the Distance between them and the inferior Rank of Men it is not to be wonder'd at and these Stratagems were of several kinds as the Occasion and the Wit of the Undertakers presented for you are to suppose the inquiring Temper of the common People to be arriv'd to such a Height that nothing could pass with them for True at least nothing which had any Novelty in it unless it was confirm'd by some strange thing some Sign some Miracle to be wrought by which the Mind receiving a due Impression entertain'd the rest of the propos'd Wonder with the more Satisfaction  At first the  Magicians  satisfy'd the Curiosity of the People by Juggle and Trick by framing artificial Voices and Noises foretelling strange Events by mechanical Appearances and all the Cheats which we find put upon the ignorant People to this Day and it would be tedious to enumerate the Particulars by which they impos'd upon one another You may guess at them by such as are mention'd before but principally those who studied the heavenly Motions had great Opportunities of recommending themselves for Men of Craft pretending to tell Fortunes calculate Nativities resolve Doubts read the Lines of Nature drawn in the Face Palms of the Hand Symetry of the Body Moles and Marks on the Flesh and the like  These things they carry'd to a due Length and we find the Success was so much to their Advantage that the whole World or great Part of it has been Gypseyridden by them even to this Day  It would fill a Volume larger than I propose this shall be to give an Account of the several Stratagems those People had Recourse to in the early Days of Sorcery and  Magick  in order to maintain their Character in the World as extraordinary For I must do them so much Justice as I go to observe that they did not immediately run to the Devil for Help or at least if some among them dealt in the Dark and corresponded below they did not all do so perhaps they were not harden'd enough at first for the carrying on such a Traffick 'Twas a new Commerce and had something a little shocking at first till the necessity of their Southsaying Circumstances brought them to comply with any thing rather than lose their Trade  The  Aegyptians  you must know were a People originally attended with two things which naturally made way for these Magical Studies  Most impertinently Inquisitive grosly Ignorant in the main as Ignorance would be called now but mighty Wise as things were rated at that time and prying into every thing with an irresistible Passion for what they call'd Knowledge on this Account they pass'd for the wisest Nation on Earth and  Aegypt  was esteem'd the Center of Learning and Knowledge Hence  Moses  was said to be learned in all the Wisdom of the  Aegyptians  It is true and they are upbraided with it by the  Ethiopians  of  Arabia Felix  which they call the South and who tho'  Arabians  are call'd  Ethiopians  in Scripture I say it is true that the  Aegyptians  learned all their Magick that is their Astronomy and Astrology from the  Arabians  and they  tell us that  Abraham  instructed his Son  Ishmael  in all the superior Knowledge in which his Posterity afterwards grew so famous  With this inquisitive Temper of the  Aegyptians  they were also most ridiculously Superstitious I say most ridiculously because it shew'd it self in that sordid and most simple Idolatry which they had mong them in which they sunk below the common Notions of Worship practis'd by the most ignorant Nations in the World for they worship'd or made a God of almost every thing that came in their way as the Ox the Calf the Water of  Nile  nay the River it self the Sand the Crocodiles and numberless things as senseless as those  As these things were peculiar to them as a Nation so they particularly qualify'd them to be impos'd upon by their Southsayers and Magicians with all manner of Delusions nor did the subtle Magicians fail to make their Advantage upon all Occasions of this superstitious and inquiring Humour of the People but used all possible Stratagem and Art to delude and impose upon them  To this purpose they soon mixt their Religion and their Magick together their Philosophy and their Idolatry were made Assistant to the general Fraud and to raise a due Veneration in the Minds of the People To this or that particular Tale advanc'd by their Priests they brought always along with them some extraordinary Revelation from the Gods some wonderful Discovery in Nature or something strange and miraculous  How strangely does religious Enthusiasm keep its hold of Mankind and how exactly do past things and present correspond As the End is the same so are the Means pious Frauds got ground from the Beginning and pious Frauds get ground to the End As no Cheats are so fatal as those which  come prefac'd with Introductions of Religion so no Cheats are so easy to prevail so soon make Impressions upon the People or stamp those Impressions deeper  The Priests among the  Aegyptians  when they turn'd  Magicians  or rather I should have said the  Magicians  when they turn'd Priests set up for Revelation Inspiration and a Conversation with their Gods and for this purpose they withdrew into the Desarts and Wastes of which the Country is known to be full and where to their Glory Shame be it spoken the Religious of the  Romish  Church play'd the same Game over again some Ages afterward  Hither the  Aegyptian  Priests I say retir'd for Conversation with their Gods from whence they were sure to come back inspir'd that is to say fill'd with some new Delusion to impose upon the People Here they cut sacred Marks upon the Trees and then brought them back as the Language taught them from the Gods and by which they pretended after muttering over them some unsignifying Significations to utter some Answers to any Difficulties proposed to them and then sending their Votaries into the Wilderness they would set them to search for the same Divine Characters which after long looking for they would find upon some Stone or Post or Tree and come home in Raptures for the Discovery  Others of these Divine  Magicians  or Diviners rather would clamber up to the top of the Pyramids whose immense Height we have such certain Accounts of as may make the climbing up seem incredible whatever else may not be so Yet here they went to make Observations and Calculations of the heavenly Motions some say but according to others to make their Conjurations their sacred Retreats and to carry on the Delusion of conversing with the Gods  Here also they cut their Diabolical Marks which the  Aegyptians  call the Sacred Characters which they left behind them indeed in the Stone upon the upper flat of the Pyramid for according to the learned  Greaves  the Summit of the Pyramid was not a Point as the top of a Spire or as representing a Flame and which by its great Height it seem'd to be but the uppermost Part form'd a Plain which  Stephanus  in his Comment supplying the Defect in  Herodotus  makes to be eight  Orgyiae  which again according to  Suidas  is a  Fathom  or six Foot so that the Plain on the top of the Pyramid must be eight Fathom square Others report it to be nine Foot only tho' I think the former more probable  But be that as it will here 'tis certain they made or found made by others certain dark Mystick and as they pretended sacred Characters whose Significations were represented by the Priests just as they pleas'd for we have reason to believe they had not then the use of Letters and as some think these mystick Characters were the Original of all the Hyeroglyphick Writing which was afterwards the ordinary Practice of the  Aegyptians  till the  Hebrew  Characters were handed to them by  Moses  from the Writing of God deliver'd him at Mount  Sinai    It is very well observ'd by the learned Author just now nam'd that had not the Priests stood in need of something extraordinary to make their coelestial Converse seem more Weighty and Important all their Astronomical Observations might as well have been made from the plain of the Rock upon which those Pyramids are built and which support the Foundation which as he takes notice is it self so elevated that in a Country which is all a low flat and level Surface for near fifty Miles every way and affords a fair Horison is as well suited for all  such Observations as require a large extended Prospect as it would be if it were seven or eight hundred Foot higher which is supposed to be the Height of the Pyramid  But the Reason is evident the mounting the Steps or Degrees of the Pyramid on the outside was a work of vast Labour and some Hazard Every Head could not bear the Elevation every Mind could not have Resolution to undertake it few would venture up to examine the Truth of the Characters or bring down Copies of them much less examine into the Nature of them And if they had gone up it was enough the cunning Priest  had imprest them there and left the Originals upon the top Stone of the wonderful Building magical and awful in it self and as it was really so that there the Characters were to be seen it was no hard matter to persuade the credulous superstitious People  That they were written there by the Finger of the Gods  That the Interpretation of them was given by Inspiration to the same Priests or wise Men who first discover'd and brought down the Characters themselves  How far these Delusions have prevail'd and do to this Day prevail among the  Aegyptians  I need not tell you 'tis enough to say it has gone such  Length as has encouraged Enthusiastic Pretenders and made  Aegypt  the Nursery of Witchcraft to the whole World  But why should we think it strange to have Divinity and Magick thus blended together in a Country so superstitious as  Aegypt  Has there not been a stranger Mixture of Magick and Witchcraft not omitting Priestcraft in all kinds of Religions ever since and is it less among the Politer Religions now in Vogue than it was in those Days  To begin at the very Pinnacle of the Church and to leave Judaical Magick all behind us tho' they had the Devil almost in every Synagogue I say to begin at the Pinnacle of the Church How many Popes in particular does History give us an Account of who have been Sorcerers and Conjurers and who have dealt with the Devil in the most open and avow'd manner How has the  Romish  Church been establisht upon the Artificial Magick of the Clergy and how justly may we say to her as  Jehu  to the King of  Israel What Peace while the Whoredoms of thy Mother Jezebel and her Witchcrafts are so many  But not to make our Enquiries a Satyr upon our selves in falling upon Popery where we are equally guilty let us recommend it to our Most Reverend and Right Reverend to put our own Ecclesiastick Affairs into such a good Posture that we may have no  Magick  among us that while we pull down the formal  Magicians  we may not set up the  cunning Men  upon the Fall of the  wise Men  and erect Heresy in the room of Schism  Some People pretend our Modern Divinity is so Magical in its own Nature that it is not easy to separate them that is in a word the Devil has so far encroach'd upon the Church that it is impossible to cast him out the Truth is if it was not so we should hardly have such a struggle as has now been among us to keep the true Lord in Possession And since the Church has but one true and rightful King and Sovereign there would never have been such a bold Attempt to depose him if the Devil the ancient Usurper of his Throne had not been at work again to step up in his Room But we shall have occasion to speak of this Part more plainly by and by  It was with great Success that the  Aegyptian  Priests went on in the manner as above and their Artificial Magick went a great way in all the  Eastern World they were counted the best and wisest Men who Mountebank like could show most Tricks and invent the most surprizing things to take with the Vulgar so as to give their Words the Force of an Oracle and entitle them to the Character of Divine and Prophetick And thus we may suppose the World going on for many Ages till at length to come nearer our own Times and indeed nearer to the Practice of our own Times too their Mimickry was exhausted they had no more Tricks to play the juggling Trade grew stale and dull the World began to look beyond them and expected something more and so the last I do not say the Church Jugglers went to the Devil for Help I had rather tell you that another Generation who had always been true  Magicians  true Practicers of the Diabolical Part came in play of course and succeeded the first who gradually deposed themselves by their meer Impotency and just as Darkness is a deprivation of Light and succeeds it by the meer Consequence of things so the honest Ignorance of the innocent  Magician  being unable to keep the Expectation of the People up and answer the Importunities of the Age dealing with the Devil succeeded even by the meer Consequence of things  The new Magick coming thus in Play let us see how it made its first Entrance in the World and in what Shapes it began to appear in which Search we shall find in short that Religion still open'd the Door For as the Devil aspir'd at nothing more from the Beginning than to be set up for a God so he always built his Chappel close by God's Church it was in the Consequence of this that the Priests were always his more immediate Correspondents How long they continued so but especially when the Correspondence ceas'd would be a Discovery worth making to the World but O how difficult  It is indeed to be observ'd and the Devil has done us Christians that Justice that Satan has discover'd his Attachment to the Pagan Rites in Distinction from and Opposition to the Christian Worship on many Occasions and that particularly as perhaps the latter is more fitted to introduce Devilworship in the World we have some Instances of his making this Distinction particularly when the Emperor  Julian  while he was only  Caesar  and had not declar'd himself Apostate nay was perhaps more inclin'd to be a Christian than a Pagan for he was Educated a Christian I say it was observ'd that he was perverted from Christianity and confirm'd a Pagan by  Maximus  a  Magician    NB  This  Maximus  was a  Magician  when the Word  Magician  signified no more a wise Man or a Southsayer but a downright Conjurer a Master of the Blackart or One who dealt with the Devil  Nor was it that the  Magicians  were Favourers of Paganism only but such was the Subtilty of the Devil that indeed the Pagan Worship consisted much in Sorcery and Magick Conjurings Invocation of Devils and raising evil Spirits by These the Rites and Ceremonies of Paganism were supported 'Tis said of the famous Champion of the Christian Religion  Athanasius  that he understood all the Mysteries of the Pagan Theology but we are not come to that Length in our Enquiries yet  The Devil had a great many good Reasons to befriend the Pagan Worship rather than the Christian for that indeed the Substance of Paganism was a Diabolical System in it self and to worship the Heathen Gods was Essentially to worship the Devil as we shall see in its Place  We must observe here that the Curiosity of Man in the most early Times was never fully gratified but when his Understanding was as it were confounded when he was under some Astonishment and Surprize at seeing or hearing some strange thing The Pharisees when they were attacking our Saviour as they almost were always and when as they thought they insulted him ask'd him what Sign doest thou show that thou doest such things as these  And in other Places 'tis said when he did perform some miraculous Things they were astonish'd at him Astonishment introduces Silence Men are first amaz'd and have nothing to say and then Nature dictates Credulity as the Consequence  viz  that when they are thus surpriz'd with Wonder they should consequently believe the Person who so astonish'd them with his Miracles tho' by the way it was not always so with the  Jews  for they were amaz'd and yet did not believe neither in which they were something of Kin to an unbelieving Christian in our Town of Ecclesiastic Fame too who says he wonders and is astonish'd at the Majesty of the Scripture Style and yet does not believe a Word they say A bolder Infidel I have not met with since I was last at the Pagan Circle near old  Charing  where God was own'd sworn by imprecated blasphem'd and deny'd all in a Breath  But to go on The Curiosity of Mankind I say was never fully satisfy'd but when something wonderful was offer'd and therefore Miracle was immediately call'd for when any new System was offer'd or any thing difficult proposed  Thus when God sent  Moses  and  Aaron  to  Pharaoh  he supposes the very Case  Moses  and  Aaron  were to assure  Pharaoh  that God sent them and they were in his Name to demand Liberty for the  Children of  Israel  The Demand was surprizing 'twas an insolent thing indeed for a couple of Slaves to come and ask the King to release six hundred thousand Men Slaves like themselves from their Captivity and from the King's Service whose Subjects or rather Servants they were and  Pharaoh  'tis to be suppos'd began to resent it nay we may suppose without any Presumption that  Pharaoh  's Courtiers made Game at 'em and his Ministers of State perhaps propos'd to punish them for their Impudence and for putting such Notions into the People's Heads which might be dangerous and might excite Tumults and Rebellion and therefore it was Prudence to suppress the Insolence and make Examples of the two pretended Ambassadors  But hold  says Moses  we do not come to affront your  Majesty  nor are the People we come to speak for inclin'd to revolt or rebel but we come from God the People of  Israel  whom we represent are God's chosen favourite Nation tho' they are your Servants and they are commanded to go three days Journey into the Wilderness to perform a great Sacrifice and make a great Feast to him and therefore we come to desire your Leave that we may go peaceably and do the Duty of our Worship assuring your Majesty that God himself who has thus commanded us out has sent me to you to demand your Assent  God sent you  says the King  a fine Story for you to put into the People's Heads to make them idle and hinder my Business go get you gone to your Work and to your Task or I shall find a way to drive these Whymsies out of your Heads again  But still  Moses  and  Aaron  with other the Heads of the  Israelites  for there were many more with them insisted that they were sent by the immediate Direction of God himself And how do you prove  that says the King what Sign do you give me that you come with such an Authority  With this  Moses  replies to  Pharaoh  I shall soon convince your Majesty that I am sent by the Great King and God of Heaven and Earth and with that turning to  Aaron  he says to him  Brother  Throw down the Staff or Rod that is in your Hand upon the Ground before the King  Aaron  does so throws down his white Staff and immediately it was turn'd into a Serpent  The Learned have spent some Thought upon what kind of Serpent this should be but that is not to my Purpose nor are their Conjectures of any Weight especially that foolish Notion that it was the same kind of Serpent as appear'd and talk'd to  Eve  in Paradise and that it walk'd erect in  Pharaoh  's Presence so that it frighted the King  But  Pharaoh  recovering the Surprise tells them What does this signifie you shall see I have People of my own can do as much as this Upon which his two chief Conjurers or Magicians were call'd in 'tis suppos'd they were at hand for the Devil is seldom out of call when he is wanted fo  any Mischief  Upon this comes  Jannes  and  Jambres  so St  Pa  call'd them and the Text says they were two  Magicians  and perhaps there might be a great man  more of that sort for it seems the King's Cour  was not then without a sufficient Number of Cler+gy in daily waiting And the Text adds  Pharaoh  call'd the  wise Men  and the  Sorcerers  and the nex  Word calls them  Magicians  and not only  Magicians  in common as the Word was used Personally but as it was used Nationally The  Magicians  o  Aegypt  whence 'tis inferr'd that there were some  Magicians  not only more Eminent than others bu  such as were in publick Office there as the Eminent Dr H may be call'd the King's Astronomer  or as the more Eminent Mr  Flamstead  usually call'd himself the King's Stargazer and if it was not so that these Men were in ordinary Attendance and in Pay how should they be brought in so soon while  Moses  and  Aaron  were in the Presence  Well these Men being call'd in  Pharaoh  in Contempt of  Moses  and  Aaron  and the Sign or Miracle they had shewn ask'd them if they could not do that as well as  Aaron  They readily answer Yes and fall to  Pawwawing  as the  Americans  call it and using their Inchantmens invoking or whispering their Daemons or what other Diabolical Arts they might use we know not but upon this and their Staves or Rods being cast down they were turn'd into Serpents too  This was enough to make  Pharaoh  triumph over  Moses  and  Aaron  and their Company and deriding their Mirale tell them insultingly this did not at all testifie their Mission from God for they might see his wise Men could turn Rods into Serpents as well as they Nor did the Distinction which God was pleas'd to show by suffering  Aaron  's Serpent to devour or swallow up the Serpents of the  Aegyptian  Sorcerers alter the Case with  Pharaoh  for that as an Accident did not import any thing at all in the Case And thus he sent them or rather drove them away with Contempt and immediately sent Taskmasters among the People to double their Afflictions encrease their Labours and force them to make Brick without Straw  Well  Moses  and  Aaron  come again with the same Message and it had the same Event they are Banter'd and ridicul'd As if the King had call'd to them thus Well you are come again and you say God has sent you pray has he furnish'd you with any better Testimony than you had before have you any other Miracle to show  The sacred Ambassadors gravely tell him they had and if he would still refuse to grant their Demands he should see it nay they tell him beforehand what it should be namely that they would turn the Waters of  Nile  the great River of their Country into Blood  Pharaoh  as may be supposed not believing they could do it treats them still in the same manner and refuses still to receive them as Messengers from God upon which  Moses  calls to  Aaron  and bids him stretch out his Rod and smite the Waters of the River and they were immediately turned into Blood and all the Waters Ponds and Pools besides for  Aegypt  is full of Pits and Ponds wherein they preserve the Water of  Nile  after the annual Inundation  The King frighted at this sudden Change of the Water is a little calmer than he was before but considering the matter he calls his  Magicians  to see if they could not do this also as well as  Moses  when they came they did the same by which still the blinded Mind of the Prince continued obstinate  I might run through the rest of the Miracles wrought there and shew you how the  Magicians  brought Frogs but could not bring Lice but this is not to the Case the Story is known  Only one thing I must note for your Direction in the reading this Part of the Story  viz  that the Magicians could bring Plagues at least some of them as well as  Moses  and  Aaron  but the Magicians could not remove them again as  Moses  did so that the King might have perceived that which the Magicians themselves acknowledged in the Plague of the Lice that it was the Finger of God which only could remove the Plagues he brought  The whole Design of this Remark is to shew that it was always the Temper of Mankind to demand  a Sign or a Miracle to confirm any new advanced Doctrine or any extraordinary Mission and to take those Miracles when produced for a full Confirmation  This Temper of the People as it drove the Magicians to their Shifts how to supply Miracles to obtain Credit with the People so it drove them beyond their Shifts too at last and brought them to a Confederacy with the Devil for a Supply of Wonderfuls to delude the People They tell us of a certain  Sorcerer  at  Antioch  who for the Confirmation of some particular thing which he had affirmed to the People to keep up his Credit with them told them that such an Evening he would cause Fire to come down from Heaven and that it should rest on the Top of such a certain Hill in the Sight of all the City  Whether the cunning Artist had found out any Composition by which to make artificial Fireworks agreeable to what is done at this time or not is not certain tho' 'tis most certain the Art of making Gunpowder was not then known nor for above a thousand Years afterwards But for certain he caused such a Machine to mount in the Air unseen in the dark of the Evening which then bursting came down again in a Shower of Fire like the Stars as we call them which spread themselves and fall down upon the bursting of the Tail of a Rocket and this so amazed the People that they believed afterwards every thing he said  Thus  Simon  the Sorcerer is said by his Diabolical Inchantments to fly up in the Air and perform so many surprizing things that 'tis said the People called him  the Great Power of God  or the Appearance of the great Power of God  Acts  viii    Indeed the Description the Scripture gives there of this  Simon  is very remarkable to the case in hand first 'tis said  ver    That he used Sorcery and bewitched  the People  that is the People of  Samaria  then 'tis added all the People gave heed to him and said  This Man is the great Power of God  the meaning i  evident this Man has done such great and strange things shewed such Miracles such Wonders that none but the great Power of God could enable him to do and therefore 'tis certain that he is aided and assisted by the great Power of God and this he held a long time  ver    To him they had regard because for a long time he had bewitched them with his Sorceries  The Case of  Simon  and the People at  Samaria  was just as it was with  Pharaoh  and his Magicians when  Moses  and  Aaron  came to him  Pharaoh  and all his Courtiers gave heed to  Jannes  and  Jambres  for that of a long time they had bewitched them with their  Sorceries    It remains a Question here by what Power and by whose Hand it must be that the Magicians of  Aegypt  turned their Rods into Serpents smote the Waters and turned them into Blood brought up Frogs  c  that is in short mimicked or imitated the Miracles of  Moses  and  Aaron  If I am asked by whose Permission it was done I know how to answer but if you ask who was the Instrument I must say it was the  Devil  for the Text says expresly they did it by their Inchantments  On the other hand when they were baffled in their  Pawwawing  for Lice and could not perform it 'tis said expresly they acknowledged that they could not do it for that was  the Finger of God  Exod viii  Now whether the Magicians meant it is the Finger of God that hinders us from doing now as we did before so that we cannot bring up Lice as we did Frogs or whether they seemed to acknowledge that the Plague of Lice was the Finger of God tho' they did not grant that the Blood and  the Frogs were so because the Devil could do it also this I say is a Doubt which Commentators do not resolve or at least do not agree about  But take it which way you will 'tis an Acknowledgment that what they did by their Sorcery and Inchantments was not done by the Finger of God and also that when the Finger of God was in the Work their Sorcery and Inchantments were impotent and could do nothing  It is not to be questioned but as this Correspondence began between these Magicians and the infernal Spirits they did also upon all Occasions and with the utmost of their Power as well as with the greatest Artifice and Cunning endeavour to make the People believe that what they did was by the great Power of God by the Finger of Heaven for this alone answer'd the End which was Deluding and Imposing upon Mankind 'Twas the Unhappiness of that Age as it is of ours when a more modern and indeed more fatal kind of Magick is practised in the World I say it was their Unhappiness that the Minds of the People seemed prepared for their Delusions by being more easily imposed upon than usual  The  Eastern  World had for many Ages been led and guided by the Juggles and Legerdemain of their Southsayers and wise Men as they were called and when they by the Degeneracy of the Times were as I have said brought so low as to submit to Sorcery and Inchantment they had a vast Advantage over the People by the good Opinion which the People had of their Sincerity and Honesty and that they would not by any means cheat and impose upon them  Thus when Errors and damnable Doctrines in Religion are broached and set on foot among us by Men of apparent Sanctity in Conversation Men of severe Morals of rigid and austere Lives blameless  and mortified Manners strictly practising the good things which they preach and who by that Strictness of Conversation have obtained a Reputation in the World as Men that do not willingly deceive the People or that at least have not a wicked Design to deceive In such case I say Error comes armed with a fatal and double Power and its influence is much more likely to do Mischief the Hypocrisy is the more dangerous and the People more easily abused  Who could  in our Days  expect that Men of Morals Men of unspotted Lives and whose Characters would be such as never to suffer any Reproach should blemish all their Reputation which that commendable Rectitude of Life had obtained for them with harbouring a horrid and detestable Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost it self robbing the Son of God of the Equality which he thought it no Robbery to assume and denying the Godhead of him who is  God blessed for ever  ▪  But this is still too solemn and I am not also come on far enough in Order of time to talk of those People we shall meet with them again in our Way for the present I must be content to go back to the South and to the East visit the primitive Times of Sorcery and Witchcraft and see if we can find it out how the  Devil  and Mankind came to be so well acquainted as we find they have been for certainly it was not all done at once Satan whose Region is the Air and whose Business is in the Dark was not immediately corresponded with in an open publick and avowed manner he did not walk about in Person undisguis'd and open  cloathed in the Shapes and Figures of a  Devil  and acting like himself he certainly made his court to Mankind by some particular Applications or they to him for the Learned are not fully agreed who made the first Advances towards the new Acquaintance  and whether the Devil made love first or how Mankind found him out I must confess it is an Enquiry of Moment and the History of it would take up some Room in our Speculations perhaps very much to your Satisfaction I mean if we could give a true and particular Account how the  Devil  and Mankind came first acquainted  And first it would be particularly improving to our Understandings if we could tell where the first Occasion of the Correspondence lay that is to say Whether the  Devil  in the Administration of his Affairs found it absolutely necessary to settle a Correspondence among Mankind and therefore as Mr  Milton  has it travelled to this Globe upon the foot of new Discoveries and improved upon those Discoveries afterwards by the dexterity of his Management making his Acquaintance with Mankind his own way and as he found proper for his Occasions or  Whether Mankind finding their Desires to be wicked infinitely greater than their Capacities and being under an absolute Necessity of some exotick Helps some Assistances farther and other than they found natural Powers would supply made their Application to him according to the laudable Example of my old Friend and good Patron in every wicked Contrivance the late Honourable Mr  Mg M  who saving that I cannot say I believed him told me that being in an extraordinary Streight and wanting an infallible Agent in a particular Piece of Revenge where a certain Female had jilted and insulted him went out into his Garden three Nights together just at the moment of Twelve  that it seems was the critical  time for Satan to be spoke with and called him aloud by his Name telling him he wanted his immediate Attendance in an Affair of the utmost Importance  Now I say which of these two was the Case at the Beginning of the Intercourse between Man and his Master is hard to determine and would be a most admirable Discovery if the Certainty could be come at in a manner agreeable to the nature of the thing so as it might be depended upon For my own Part if I might give my Opinion I should determine it in Favour of the  Devil  and that Mankind were the Agressors first sought the Acquaintance implored his infernal Majesty's Assistance proposed a League or Confederacy with him offensive and defensive and vowed themselves to be his faithful Allies and to serve him to the utmost of their Power upon which Application Satan as powerful Princes often do yielded to their Importunities granted their Petition took them into his Protection and has been their constant Friend and Confederate on all wicked Occasions eve  since  But there is one Difficulty in the way of thi  Opinion which indeed gives me a shock in the Faith of it and seems to intimate that it cannot be so at least that it cannot be absolutely and fully s  in the largest Sense and that is How did Mankind come first to know that there was such  Creature as a  Devil  in Being that he was capable of giving them Assistance in the Agency of such black Designs as they really wanted his Help in that he was a Spirit qualified for his Correspondence and that he would upon Application give him the Assistance he wanted And again if he did know o  that any traditional Memoirs remained with him from the Records of Past Ages of the Agency of the  Devil  with old  Eve  or with any of the Antediluvean Race and how Satan had managed things in those Times yet it does not appear how he found the Way to correspond whether he had any Instructions for his Application and in a word how he  knew where to find the  Devil  out and to come to the Speech of him These Difficulties indeed lie in the way of my last  Hypothesis  and 'till they can be solved to the general Satisfaction I doubt I must quit the supposed Application of Man to the  Devil  and allow that  Satan  himself first pickt Acquaintance with him that the Correspondence began that way that the  Devil  offer'd his Service to him and let him know beforehand how ready he would be to come at his Call and to assist him upon all Occasions  I must confess this Supposition lays the  Devil  a little low in your thoughts depreciates his Character and places him beneath the Dignity of his Seraphick Original But it cannot be helped if the Devil will make himself a Slave he must and if he will be according to the happy Title of the Chief of his Confederates  Servus Servorum  who can help it The thing explains it self Whatever he was at first he certainly has been is and is like to be the most obsequious humble diligent Devil that ever Mankind could have had to do with  I must acknowledge that I did not enquire of my Friend just now named whether the  Devil  gave his Attendance immediately and with his usual Alacrity upon his calling out so Audibly to him not that I ever doubted but that the  Devil  did wait upon him because 'tis visible that he has acted as if the  Devil  had been in him ever since but I say I should have enquired whether he came at the first Call for without doubt he called loud enough for him to hear for as Voice always ascends the Vibration moving most naturally upward and that Satan's particular Residence is said to lie that way there is no room to question but he could hear him unless as  Elijah  said to the Priests of  Baal  he might be busy or asleep or gone a Journey which seldom happens to him so as to be out of the way of Mischief  NB  Here indeed I ought to make some small Apology for what I happen'd to say of the Honourable Person I just now mentioned and who I seemed to suggest was not to be believed which Expression he being a Person of Honour  I ought to explain  as I do by these Presents and in Manner and Form following  that is to say  that he is always to be believed in all Cases and relating to all Persons but himself but he claiming a Right and Privilege of slandering himself and being exceeding fond of being thought wickeder than he is I ventur'd by way of Observation to suspect his Veracity when he talks of his Father's only Son knowing that as he has so constantly boasted of Sins he was never able to commit and that every thing must be false which cannot be true so there is no Credit to be given to him in that Particular  But in all other Cases you must understand me to acknowledge him for a Man of as nice a Taste and as strict an Observer of Truth and Decency as ever Satan corresponded with which publick Acknowledgment I hope he wil  take for ample Satisfaction  Now with Pardon for the needful Digression above I go on with repeating in Substance what I concluded before  viz  that this Difficulty is so great that I cannot easily get over it  viz  to resolve who began the Acquaintance between Satan and our Ancestors of the East for there it seems they first corresponded  Nor can I proceed Historically in my present Undertaking without coming to a Certainty in this Point and 'till it is determined one way or other and for that Reason I think I must for the present 'till the  Devil  thinks fit to clear himself of the Charge leave it at his Door and grant that he  found the Correspondence so much to his Advantage that is to say so much for the Interest of his present Undertakings of another kind that he made no Scruple of being first in the Application that he stooped without Ceremony to make the first Visit and so began the Treaty afterwards in his own Name  Nor has the  Devil  been very nice in his subsequent Intimacies or in the Management of the Correspondence after it was begun but has on so many Occasions testified his Resolution to cultivate the Friendship so happily for him begun that they found him ever after at their Elbow when they had Occasion for him and sometimes whether they had Occasion for him or no whether he is less kind to their Posterity let his Friends and Confederates of the present Age testify  It is true that sometimes we find or at least they tell us so that he is too cunning for his Correspondents and that when he has drawn them into Bargains he is not so just to his Word as he should be or as they expected and this brings some Scandal upon the Acquaintance as if he was not a faithful Confederate and that he leaves his Friends often in the Lurch as he did the late famous  Cartouch  in  France Jonathan Wild  in  England  and as he has done the poor Trooper lately at  Dresden  who they say he ought to have secured from the Officers of Justice and that when he had killed Monsieur  Halm  the  Lutheran  Minister the  Devil  should have given him an invisible Cloak to have carried him off and not have left him to the Mercy of the Protestants after he had done him such an eminent Piece of Service  But let us bring things to a right Understanding do Satan Justice and set the Saddle upon the right  Devil  In these Cases the Question is not whether the  Devil  after having made Bargains with these People did not perform and was not so just to his  Word as they expected but whether he was not as just to his Word as they ought to have expected For Example perhaps in making their Bargains with the  Devil  they expect things to be performed which it is not in his Power to perform the Mistake lies not in  Satan  himself but in them who make a God of him and will have him be able to do every thing  Now 'tis true that Satan as he is a Spirit is Magnipotent but he never was Omnipotent and therefore there may be and are abundance of fine things which such People expect of him which he really not only never promises but is not in any Condition to perform and if People will have him do what he is not able to do that is their Fault not his all they can blame him for in that case is that he does not tell them how far he can or cannot serve them and that truly to give him his Due seems to be none of his Business but like a cunning Artificer who is loth to tell you what he cannot do but enlarges and expatiates upon his real Abilities so the  Devil  if you are willing to believe he can do thus and thus for you 'tis enough if he does but equivocate and tacitly grant it without engaging to perform but he is not bound to confess his Impotence and own he cannot do it So these People pretend to blame him whereas in truth they ought only to blame themselves for expecting things of him that even the  Devil  himself is not able to perform  Thus our late Friend  Jonathan  while he kept within Bounds had no doubt a faithful and friendly Correspondence with him  'But said the  Devil  What would  Jonathan  have me do did he expect I could save him when he committed a Felony even with his Fetters on and while he was in  Newgate  I had been his Protector in a thousand Rogueries Things which if I had not stood by him he could never have got over I had  hang'd a hundred and fifty honest Rogues to save him every one of which if I had not help'd him to be too cunning for them and stopt their Mouths till 'twas too late to open them could have hang'd him and saved themselves but he was come to such a Pitch at last and push'd his Fate so far that not I no not the  Devil  himself could save him  The like Plea the  Devil  made for himself no doubt in the case of his  French  Favourite  Cartouch    'Had he thought fit after a thousand audacious Villanies successfully committed and an infinite Stock of Treasure amass'd for he was grown rich by the Trade had he thought fit to have left  Paris  and march'd off either out of the Kingdom or at least out of the City where he was so well known and so diligently pursued I had carried him safe off'  But he was obstinately and inconsiderately bold and the  Devil  is not bound to save those that resolve they will be hang'd Nay if am not misinformed the  Devil  himself told him he would be taken if he staid in  Paris  and added that the Search after him was so hot and such Rewards promised and he so well known that if he Satan himself was so perfectly described and so hotly pursued he should certainly be discover'd Tho' by the way I would have you take that Part only  ad referendum  as the Men of Business call it  Now it is an unreasonable thing that Men should make a Bargain with either Man or Devil for more than they are able to perform and then pretend to blame them for NonPerformance and therefore a certain noble Lord now in Exile whom they charge with contracting with Satan for some Particular in favour of his late  Dumblane  Enterprise and which the  Devil  has it seems fail'd him in ought not as they say he does to blame the  Devil  who really could do no more for him than he did  Having then brought it to this Conclusion that the  Devil  has been really first in the Confederacy that Satan made the Acquaintance and that Man neither knew how to come at the  Devil  nor so much as knew originally that there was any such thing as a  Devil  in Being it would add to our more perfect understanding of the whole Matter if we could be informed in what manner the Acquaintance begun  The first Attack the  Devil  made upon our Mother  Eve  we have had fully described Sacred History relates the Fact and honest grave Mr  Milton  has given us the Particulars as distinctly and in as lively Colours as if he had been at the Conference heard the Courtship and how cunningly the Devil managed with what Address he insinuated into her weakest Part and how entirely he conquer'd her Virtue her Obedience her Sense of Religion brought her to forget the Command that she had but just learned to remember and to sacrifice her Soul and all her Posterity to her Appetite I say Mr  Milton  has done it in so lively a manner that it seem  plain that tho'  Solomon  could not understand the way of a Man with a Maid but placed it among the things that were too wonderful for him  Milton  seems not to be at a Loss to describe the way of the  Devil  with a Woman  Now I say we have a distinct Account how the  Devil  made the first Attack upon  Eve  in Paradise but how he pick'd Acquaintance with the Sons of  Noah  after the Deluge and in what manner or upon what Occasion that was begun we are utterly at a loss about  Nor have we any historical Account who were the Persons who entertained the first Correspondence with him or upon what Occasion nothing appears upon Record to give us the least Light into it other than this that we find the Effects of  an invisible  Devil  in  Ham  or  Cham  one of  Noah  's Sons and in  Canaan  his Grandson but it is not the invisible  Devil  that I am enquiring after but an appearing conversible Daemon or Evil Spirit who assuming human Shape or at least Voice and intelligible Operations could supply the Office of the  Devil  in assisting Mankind in the several Exigencies of their Affairs when any kind of infernal Work was upon their Hands  This I say is the  Devil  I am enquiring after and as I would fain bring Mankind and him to be acquainted together in a decent and regular manner I must confess I am at a great Loss for want of the Particulars as well of Persons as of the Circumstances in which those Persons were concerned  However since that Part cannot be entred any farther into or at least not so far as to make a full Discovery we must take up with so much as we find upon Record and this may perhaps be enough to satisfy us that so it was  The Story of  Job  according to the sacred Chronology and by comparing it with other Accounts of things appears to be very antient even so old as to be in a very few Years after  Abraham  for  Eliphaz  the  Temanite  could not by Calculation be many Removes from  Esau  and  Ishmael  and  Job  being at that Time an old Man no less than a hundred Years old he might probably be alive within the time of  Japhet  one of the Sons of  Noah  for 'tis thought  Job  was above a hundred Years old when his first Sorrows came upon him  Now in the time of  Job  'tis evident the  Devil  had made his visible Appearances upon Earth and among the Sons of GOD too for he appeared before the Lord at the time as is supposed of a solemn Service or Sacrifice What his Business was there and on what Occasion he came does not lie before me on the present Occasion  In the next place the  Devil  not only had personally appeared but it seems plain from the Text when God had given  Job  into his Hands that is to say had given him Commission to fall upon and afflict him and that he was gone out from the Presence of God that he immediately set his human as well as elementary Instruments at work that he raised a Storm of Wind from or in the Wilderness and blew the House down upon  Job  's Sons and Daughters that he brought Thunder and Lightning upon the Flocks and burnt up the poo  Sheep and the Servants that look'd after them This was nothing but what as a  Devil  and a Prince of the Air might be expected from him but that was not all he raised War upon him the  Chaldean  from one side the North and the  Sabeans  from another side the East made out their Armies and came upon him and plunder'd him the first carried away the Camels and the other the Oxen  'Tis certain those Nations were at Peace with  Job  before and his Servants fed unmolested by them and in their Neighbourhood 'till the  Devil  took upon him to break the Peace and excite them to Insult  Job  and fall upon his Substance How came this to pass and what had  Job  done to any o  them to move them to use Violence with him I make no question but the  Devil  went to them and told them God had sent him to order them in his Name to ravage the Lands and carry away the Goods of  Job  that God had destined him to Misery and Poverty and had given his Estate to them and therefore it was lawful for them to fall upon and destroy him and his Family and to give them a Sign as I said before and that they might know he came with a Commission they should see he would go and send down Fire from Heaven and destroy his Sheep and if they would not carry off the Camels and the Oxen he would do the like by those also  This and the Bait of Plunder was enough to animate those Nations against poor  Job  and so they came immediately and did as the  Devil  directed  This seems to me to be the first visible Appearance of the  Devil  among the Sons of  Noah  in the Postdiluvean Ages I will not say his Acquaintance begun here tho' if I should suppose it did I do not see that I could be contradicted by any authentick Vouchers from History Indeed it was a plausible Occasion enough for it was apparently a Favour bestowed on the  Sabeans  and on the  Chaldeans  to give them  Job  's Goods meerly for fetching and this for ought we know may be the Reason that the first Magicians that we read of any where were among those two Nations  viz Chaldeans  and  Arabians Sabeans  nor can I doubt but that the  Devil  having made his Acquaintance first here kept his Hold and Interest amongst them upon account of the good Offices he had done them and perhaps might do them on many other Occasions  Now tho' I would not be positive where there is the least Uncertainty being mighty cautious as I am at present acting in the Capacity of an Historian of doing the  Devil  any Wrong or Injury so I enter my Caveat too against an Objection here  viz  that if this be not the first time that any Man gives an Account of Satan's Appearance and that this was not the first of his Pranks which he played upon Mankind after the Flood let them shew us another before it if they can nay I believe the  Devil  himself cannot tell us any one Time or Place or any other Occasion on which he ever showed himself or perhaps durst show himself in a visible Appearance in the World I mean after the Deluge  Nor is it easie to be determined what Shape what Case of Flesh and Blood or as I might say with more Propriety what seeming Flesh and  Blood he appear'd dress'd in at that time nor will I take upon me to guess what Figure he made when he appear'd among the Sons of God and whether they knew him or not that is to say knew who he was and on what occasion he appear'd there whether  Job  was among them or not for he was doubtless one of the Sons of God and the Text owns him as such  my Servant Job  for Son and Servant I take there to have the same Signification and whether the short Discourse which it is said there the Lord held with the ArchEnemy of his Servant was audible and articulate and whether the rest heard it or no all these Difficulties I leave as the Learned say to another Opportunity  that is to say  because I am not able to say one Word to them at this  CHAP IV  Of what Shapes the  Devil  assum'd in his first Appearances to the  Magicians  and others in the First Ages of the World and whether He is or has been allow'd to assume a Human Shape or no  AS I have ingenuously acknowledg'd in my last Chapter that I can give you no Account of what Dress or Shape the Devil appear'd in when he presented himself among the Sons of God as noted in the first Chapter of  Job  or whether he was visible to any else but his Maker so I am equally uncertain in what Figure he made his first Appearances afterwards among his own Acquaintance and Servants when he was introduc'd  It must therefore suffice to tell you that however it was manag'd we find there was certainly  an Intelligence carry'd on a Correspondence maintain'd and what was not perfo  d  onally was done by Inchantments which we call Sorcery by Voices and by Dreams or by Apparition in such Shapes and Postures as Satan for Reasons of State thought fit to take upon himself for the Occasion  Some have doubted whether the Devil is empower'd to take up any human Shape or to appear in the Figure of a Man and they argue that it does not seem consistent with the Goodness of the great Father of Mankind to suffer the ArchEnemy of his Creatures to go about in such a Disguise so dangerous and that might be so fatal to him for that he would be always in danger of being deceiv'd to his Hurt that he could never be safe but that as the Scripture directs us to be courteous to Strangers because some by being so had entertain'd Angels so it would make us be shy and afraid of Strangers for that we should be always afraid we might receive the Devil into our Houses and especially into our Friendship and Familiarity And hence I believe came the foolish empty Notion tho' such as it is impossible to root out of the Fancies of Men  viz  that the Devil cannot appear without his cloven Foot of which I shall say nothing here but that it is a thing so ridiculous as to merit no Notice either now or at any other time  Tho' there may be many things said for this Opinion and particularly to that Part which relates to the Safety of Mankind in case of the several Disguises that the Devil may appear in yet I cannot exclude the Devil from the Privilege of putting on our Clothes sometimes and that too perhaps oftner than we may think he does and that he appears in such a Shape too oftner than we may believe he does As to the Danger of it I may speak of that by it self  I have taken it for granted in my last Chapter that in the first Acquaintance between Mankind and the Evil Spirit after the Deluge Satan was the Aggressor that he made his Application to them first made his Proposals of Assistance and Help in the Cases wherein he knew they wanted his Correspondence and I shall add that he perhaps rais'd difficult perplex'd Cases in the World on purpose to prepare the Way for his rendring himself useful  We are come now to the Manner I mean How and in What Way the cunning Manager made his first Address to Mankind It is true we are something deficient in the History of this first Transaction because we do not yet know nor can easily find out who was his first Correspondent in the World but if you will take what has been by what is and judge of his first Method by his subsequent Practice I think I may give you room to make a fair Judgment Nor do I think 'tis an improper way of determining the Point since as Satan found the first Step successful 'tis probable he found no occasion to alter his Measures and tho' differing Circumstances of Place and Persons may make him vary a little as he sees Occasion yet I have I think a great deal of reason to suppose that the general rule of his Practice is much the same and that he proceeds upon the same foot with Mankind in all Ages and on all Occasions  mutatis mutandis  as he finds the Circumstances of the People the same or not the same  Take then the Devil's first Method with Mankind to be grounded upon his own Experience in his Antediluvean Practices with their Ancestors upon his Knowledge of their Present Circumstances I mean Present at the time after the Flood you must allow Satan to have so much Cunning in him as to be able without the least Hesitation to  know what was the best Method to come about the Man and how to compass him and for that reason I say I do not allow him to have made any Change in his Measures  The first Method then that I suppose the Devil took to make his Acquaintance with Mankind was by the way of Dreams and here I shall go back so far as to suggest that he put  Canaan Noah  's Grandson upon intoxicating the good Patriarch his Grandfather with Wine for I join with a late Opinion that it was  Canaan  not  Ham  that was the Occasion of it tho'  Ham  was guilty of triumphing over the old Man when he was overcome and exposing him as far as lay in him to his modester Brethren  Suppose then young  Canaan  very busy helping and assisting his Grandfather in planting and dressing the Vines after the Flood and in gathering the Fruit take then the following Observations upon those Circumstances in particular  First  I cannot come into that foolish Notion that  Noah  did not understand the Nature of the Vine or the Strength of the Juice when the Grapes were press'd and the Wine ran out and that he drank it ignorantly I say I cannot come into that Opinion For  Noah  who had no doubt preach'd against the Vices of the Antediluvian World and against Drunkenness among the rest must certainly know the Use of the Vine and the Abuse of it too how else did he come to plant it at all and to press the Juice out for Drinking it at all  Gen ix  Noah began to be an Husbandman and he planted a Vineyard    And he drank of the Wine and was drunken  Secondly  It does not seem that the time of  Noah  's Drunkenness was upon the pressing of the Grapes or the pressing the first Grapes of his new Plantation it must certainly be a considerable time after  his planting them and after his first making of Wine For tho' 'tis very probable that he planted the Vines immediately after the Flood and the Text seems to intimate as much yet 'tis evident it must be many Years after that when he fell into the snare of Drunkenness For  Canaan  who was the  a Man grown was not Born at the coming out of the  Ark  and there must be at least twenty or thirty Years between that time and the Fact For if  Canaan  had not been Major had not been at Man's Estate he would not in probability have been curs'd by his Grandfather as a Principal in the Crime as it is evident he was For it does not seem that he was cursed so particularly as an Accessary only or for the meer Offence of his Father nor would it have been Righteous in  Noah  to have done so But as he is so warmly fallen upon and so particularly by the old Patriarch in hi  Anathema  'tis very probable he was a Principal in the Fact of abusing him  Suppose then I say young  Canaan  busy in assisting his Grandfather in planting and dressing the Vines and in pressing the Fruit the Devil takes this for a Handle and subtly makes  Canaa  dream For I'll grant with Mr  Milton  that the Devil had from the Beginning the Art of whispering to him in his Sleep as that Author makes him do to  Eve  in Paradise and thereby making him dream of any thing he pleas'd Take him the  whispering to  Canaan  that he should make his Grandfather drunk with the Wine and that he should be able to do what he pleas'd with him ever after insinuating that the Effect of it would be to make his Grandfather have a greater Affection to him than to any of the rest of his Grandchildren This is not improbable because the Devil always Tempts with the Expectation of some apparent Good  Others suggest that  Noah  having reprov'd and reproach'd  Canaan  for some Crime and perhaps caus'd him to be corrected for it the Devil took hold of his Resentment which by the way is not much unlike a Devil and propos'd this method of Revenge to him in a Dream as if he had dream'd that he had prevail'd over his Grandfather by persuading him to drink himself drunk and had thereby made him expose himself in a beastly manner 'till he became the Ridicule and Jest of the whole Family which by that time was very numerous and that  Canaan  pleased with the lively Representation of his Grandfather's Shame resolv'd the Devil prompting him to it in other subsequent Dreams if possible to give himself the Satisfaction of bringing it to pass and to persuade the old Man to drink himself Drunk the next time he came to assist him in the Business and that accordingly he did so and prevail'd  Whether Satan did it thus or by any other method of Insinuation we are not sure but it is very probable it was by a Dream Nor is it clear to me that the Devil had ever any other way but by Dream or Apparition to come at the intelligent Faculties of Man 'Tis evident he does suggest Evil now he must do it sleeping or waking if sleeping it must be by a Dream in which he does but imitate the good Spirit which as the Scripture says plainly and gives a multitude of Instances of it opens the Understandings of Men in the Night Visions and seals their Instructions Nor is it a new Practice of Satan to mimick and imitate his Maker in the Measures and Operations of his Wisdom with Mankind  But be that as it will we are sure the Devil does communicate his malicious Proposals of Mischief to Mankind you have two eminent Examples of  it in Scripture which are too plain and too direct to my purpose here to admit any Dispute first in the Case of  David  and his Project of numbring the Poeple 'tis said expresly Chron xxi  Satan moved David to number the People  Where by the way tho' it was his Sin yet by it we gain a piece of Information how prodigiously populous the Tribes were at that time  viz  that there were fifteen hundred and seventy thousand fighting Men in only ten of the Tribes an incredible Number to inhabit so small a Spot of Ground as the Land of  Canaan  besides Women and Children But that by the way  The second Example which renders it out of all doubt that Satan has Access to the Thoughts of Men is that of  Judas  John xiii  Satan put it into the Heart of  Judas  to betray Christ  Now I say as above▪ this must be done sleeping or waking if sleeping▪ it must be by Dreams if waking it must be by Voice Possession or Apparition We shall consider them all in their Place  It is probable that the first Method the Devi  took in the World was by Dream as for Posse  +sion we do not meet with it very early as to Voic  and Apparition we take them to be all subsequen  and the Effect of a long Acquaintance as amon  Men there are several degrees of Communicatio  with one another after Men have a Personal Know+ledge and Acquaintance before it comes up to  Inti+macy  and  Friendship    Dream then being the first way of Access or by which the Devil found the way into the Man▪ there is no room to doubt but by this Method h  found means also to infuse into his Mind an infi+nite Variety of corrupt Imaginations wicked De+sires and abhorred Conclusions and Resolutions▪ with some ridiculous foolish and absurd things  the same time  Thus I cannot think but the Devil first put it into the Hearts of the Men of the old World to go about that ridiculous piece of Work as I observ'd it to be before of building of  Babel  first by filling their Thoughts with daily Terrors and Apprehensions of another Inundation thronging their sleeping Imaginations with Fancies of new Rains to overflow them by which every time they had any hasty Showers which rais'd the Water of the Rivers or Brooks to what we call a LandFlood they would be immediately alarm'd as if another Deluge was a coming upon them and that they were immediately to be drown'd  Thus raising the Vapours in their Hypocondrias they were every Night dreaming that they heard it Thunder that they saw heavy Rains and that the Brooks and Rivers swell'd or as we say in our common Discourse on such Occasions  the Waters were out  in Consequence of this he puts them upon considering of Means for their own Security and then they dream every Night of Methods One while they are for building another Ark another time for building a Thousand that is to say an Ark for every Family or Patriarchate or Tribe one time this foolish thing and another time that and perhaps many Men dreaming on many several Methods till at last they bring their sleeping Cogitations to a waking Consultation and there they resolve upon the meanest emptyest and most inconsistent Project that ever any Body of Men form'd in their Heads And which if the Devil had not been in them and drawn them into it as I say meerly to impose upon and expose them even to their own Ridicule could never have come into their Heads I mean the Building of  Babel    If the Devil did excite that foolish Imagination he must do it as he was a meer Devil to show his Malice to put them upon doing something extremely Ridiculous and which should at last expose them to their own Resentments on the Madness and Folly of it or which I rather think he bewilder'd their Imaginations without any immediate Prospect other than this that he knew it would end in some ridiculous Undertaking either very  foolish  or very  wicked  not knowing which it would be and perhaps not much caring so it would be but provoking to their Maker and what might any way bring his Displeasure upon them  And here by the way I cannot but observe that the Method God in his Providence was pleas'd to take with Mankind upon their entring upon that foolish Piece of Work was the mildest and kindest that could be imagin'd and the most to their Interest calculated for their Good evidently issuing so and that much more than letting them go on in their Madness would have been  Had Heaven thought fit to have wink'd at the audacious Attempt and to have let them go on with it as far as their own Ignorance and Obstinacy would have guided them 'till by the immense Circle of the first Stages of the Building they had form'd an Ascent higher than any thing of its kind could be suppos'd to stand yet they must have stop'd at last it must have ended somewhere the time would have come at length that as they had call'd a Council about the first Building of it they would have call'd another with a  go to now  shall we  leave off  this mad Piece of Work that as they had advis'd with one another saying  Go to let us Build  Gen xi so they would have said  Go to let us leave off Building    Suppose them to have found the Way up to the Regions above the Atmosphere or where else you can imagine and that they then found themselves as much remote from Heaven whither they had propos'd the Tower should reach as they were at first and that among the other Mischiefs they had met with such as the Difficulty of carrying Materials so high and the Difficulty of breathing  c  they had also begun to discover that their Work was fruitless and would be endless as must have been the Case they would certainly have given it over at last and with Indignation at themselves perhaps at one another have laid it aside  What a piece of Folly would the fruitless Toil have been how would they have reproach'd themselves and perhaps falling out and going together by the Ears about it the Victors would have made the Vanquish'd pull it down and carry away the Materials that the Monument of their Shame might be removed out of their Sight The first that is leaving off the Work I say must have happen'd at last the other it was very likely would have happen'd so that 'tis out of doubt Heaven acted the kindest Part for them by confounding their Speech to make the going on with it impracticable so bringing them to a Necessity of laying it aside before they had carried it on too far  Having thus with a rational Prospect propos'd the first Method of Satan's making his Acquaintance with Mankind and so brought him to a Scene of Action 'tis very rational to suggest that he began the Method very early and therefore those two Experiments of  Canaan  and the Builders of  Babel  are not improper to mention as they seem to be things which Mankind had never attempted if the Devil had not put them upon it nor had  the Devil at that time any other way to bring it to pass but by Dreams at least not as we know of  It may also be observ'd that the first Converse of Mankind with the invisible World whether with the evil Spirits or with the Good or even with their Maker himself was by Dreams and therefore it is not improbable that Satan made his Application to them the same way We have it very early mention'd  Gen  xv  The Word of the Lord came to Abram in a Vision  that is a Dream and again  A deep sleep fell upon Abram and lo a horrour of great Darkness fell upon him and he said unto him  ver  It is in some particular Texts said  the Lord appeared to Abram  which if interpreted by other Places must be understood to be in  a Dream  for in those Places when God convers'd by Apparition with  Abram  or call'd to him by Voice it is distinguish'd expresly in so many Words that  God said  and  God  went up from talking with Abram  and  the Lord appeared to him in the Door of his Tent  and the like  As God himself took this Method with  Abram  and so with  Moses  and so with many others both before and since so the Devil found means to make his Address to Mankind by the same way Hence we find a mighty great Stress laid upon some of the Dreams of the Ancients in those Days and much ado was made about the Interpretation of them For when once a Man of Note had dream'd any Important Dream any Dream which seem'd to have something extraordinary in it away they went to their Cunning Men their Southsayers and  Magicians  to enquire of them the Meaning and Interpretation of these Dreams  Now bring all these Circumstances together and you will find the Devil subtily insinuating Dreams  into the Heads of Princes and Great Men and then by like Dreams communicating to his Correspondents those very Dreams and what Interpretations they should make of them  This was a particular Favour done in Aid of those  Magicians  who were more than ordinarily in his good Graces and no doubt it gave them a particular Reputation at Court and in the Opinion of the People as having a more than ordinary Understanding in hidden Matters or having a very particular Intelligence in the secret and reserv'd Part of Nature or a Correspondence in the World of Spirits  Ali Albrahazen  a  Persian  Wizard had doubtless this Intercourse with the Devil if what I have to say of him is true He was it seems a  Sabian  by Birth and had obtain'd a wonderful Reputation for his Witchcraft the same which I suppose the Scripture calls Inchantments in the Case of the  Magicians  of  Aegypt  when  Moses  and  Aaron  came to work Miracles before  Pharaoh  he you may suppose was sent for by the King of  Persia  upon some extraordinary Occasion such as the Interpretation of a Dream or of some Apparition like that of  Belshazzar  's Handwriting or some Meteor or Eclypse and he never fail'd to give them great Satisfaction on such Occasions For whether his Accounts were true or false he always deliver'd them in such ambiguous Terms that something of what he predicted might be sure to be deduc'd from his Words and so seem to Import that he had effectually reveal'd it whether he had really done so or not  This  Ali  so Fame tells you being in the Desart wandering by himself and musing much upon the Appearance of a certain Fiery Meteor which had to the great Terror of all the Country been seen every Night for twenty or thirty Nights successively was mighty desirous  to understand the Meaning of it and what it should Portend to the World but being utterly incapable to make the least probable Guess at the Thing the Reason or Nature of it much less its Import or Meaning he sat him down under a Palmtree weary with his Travelling and his Mind also tyr'd and weary'd with fruitless and unperforming Imaginations Here he vehemently wish'd that some attending Spirit would be so assisting to his Fancy that he might at least make some probable Conjectures at the true Meaning of that strange  Phaenomenon  and also at what might probably be the Issue and Event of it to the World  With this very warm and importuning Desire he fell asleep and being in a deep Sleep he dream'd that a tall Man came to him of a venerable majejestic Aspect but with a pleasing and chearful Smile on his Face and calling him by his Name told him that he was come at his Request to answer his Importunities and that he would tell him the Signification of the Great and Terrible Fire in the Air which was seen in his City and in all  Arabia  and  Persia    And now says he you shall understand that these fiery Appearances are nothing but certain Collections of Matter exhaled by the Influence of the Sun from the Earth or Sea or perhaps from other solid Bodies in the Compass of the Solar System such as the Planets and other Bodies which you in this Earth know nothing of  These being set on Fire in their wandering Motion appear like Stars or Comets for a time being driven about in the Expanse by the Impetuosity of their own Motion and become visible in this Hemisphere to the infinite Terror of the People as thou seest it now is tho' those Apprehensions and that Amazement of the People are very groundless  and raised only from their own Folly and Ignorance  For as to the Importance of them to human Affairs the truth is  Ali  and you are to be undeceiv'd in that Point they have no Import or Signification at all other than that sometimes by their near Approach to the Earth and by their Attraction or by their Dissipation of moist Vapours they occasion sometimes great Drought and insupportable Heat and at other times distilling great and unusual Rains by condensing in an extraordinary manner the Vapours which by their acquir'd Heat they have exhal'd  Ali  was surpriz'd at this Account and being encourag'd to speak he reply'd But what shall I answer to my People who expect great things from me I have often satisfy'd them in like Difficulties but when I shall come to tell them that it signifies nothing at all that it is only the effect of a natural Cause and is of no Import more than an ordinary Star they will stone me and say that Heaven never hangs out such Signals without some Signification that I only impose upon them because I am Ignorant and do not understand the Motions and Intimations of the Heavenly Bodies or how the Affairs of this World are influenc'd by them  O  Ali  O  Albrahazen  highly favour'd said the Apparition I will instruct thee then how to prevent thy being despis'd by the Elders of thy People on Condition that thou wilt now and on all Occasions give ear to my Instructions and follow those Rules that I shall set thee  To this he readily assented and made such Assurances as were satisfactory to the Spectre Go then says the Vision and warn thy Nation that this Fiery Meteor Portends an excessive Drought and Famine for know thou that by the strong exhaling  the Vapours of the Earth which is occasion'd by the Meteor's unusual nearness to this Hemisphere the necessary Rains will be withheld and by a long Drought thou knowest Famine and Scarcity of Corn succeeds of course Thus by judging according to the Rules of Natural Causes thou shalt predict what shall certainly come to pass and shalt obtain the Reputation which thou so earnestly desirest to wit of a Sage  Magician  and  wise Man    But says  Ali  and what shall I say to the Lords of the  Persian  Court wh  have sent for me to enquire of me on the same  Phaenomenon  what shall it Portend to that Nation will the same Fate be the Consequence to their Country as is portended to this  To this the subtle Devil answers This Inquiry is to thee of the utmost Consequence Fiery Me  eo  sometimes from the same Natural Causes produc  just contrary Events and whereas these Bodies  I said exhale an infinite Quantity and Bulk of Vapours which they ra  ifie by their Heat and  cause immoderate Drought and Heat in such an  such Climates and particular Countries where they approach too near so on the other hand the  are in themselves vast Collections of humid and watery Vapours which if hastily condens'd wou'  be sufficient to deluge the World and drown Mankind and sometimes they condense in so considerable Quantities as to descend upon the Earth an  cause excessive Rains and Floods and great Desolations of the Country Go then fearless says he to the  Persian  Court and Predict to them excessive Rains and Floods which shall greatly hurt the Fruits of the Earth and occasion great Dearth also Thus if either of these succeed as it is most proba  le thou shalt be assuredly receiv'd as a Sage  Magician  in one Country if not in the other Also  both these thou mayst suggest as a Probability only the Consequence of these to be a Plague or Infection among the People which is ordinarily the Effect as well of excessive Wet as of excessive Heat if this happens thou shalt gain the Reputation thou desirest and if not seeing thou didst not positively foretel it thou shalt not incur the Ignominy of a false Predictor  This was very obliging in the Devil it must be confess'd if the Story be true and  Ali  was very sensible of the Help it was to him and fail'd not to ask the Vision how he should obtain his promis'd Assistance in the like Cases of Difficulty Upon which the Vision told him that whenever he wanted his Help he should come again to the Palmtree and that surrounding the Tree fifteen times he should call him aloud by his Name three times every time he went round the Tree and at the end of the fifteenth time he should find Sleepiness come upon him when he should lay himself down as he did now with his Face to the South and if he fell asleep he should be sure to receive a Visit from him in Vision and with this he gives him the Magick Name which he was to call him by  Ali  was infinitely exalted with the thoughts of this Information which let him so much into the Secret of Nature as to enable him to speak in a Dialect infinitely superior to the common Understanding and in particular to make a Judgment of things out of the reach of the most Pretending of the rest of his fellow  Magicians  When he went home among the People he fail'd not to give his Judgment of the terrible Appearance in the Air and told them positively it portended a great Drought and Heat in the approaching Summer to which he added as a Suggestion only that he had great reason to believe it would be attended  with a Famine and perhaps the Famine might be follow'd with a Plague insinuating that if the Famine was not attended with a Plague among his own Countrymen as he had said it would it was then likely it would appear first in  Persia  their Neighbouring Kingdom and perhaps it might afterwards spread among them  This terrible Prediction deliver'd with the Authority of one whom they had the Venerable Opinion of before as a  Magician  and one that could foretel Events of things gave the People an Alarm and also their King with them to whom the News of the Prediction was soon carry'd but the  Magician  conceal'd entirely from their Knowledge the Manner of his obtaining his Information so that it came to them on the single Authority of his own Judgment  It happen'd as a Confirmation of his Prediction that after the Meteor ceas'd to appear and the Spring Season advanc'd an extreme hot Season came on with a long Drought following for several Weeks which began very much to burn up the Fruits of the Earth immediately the People remembring the Words of the  Magician  and finding so much of what he had said prove true it put them in a great Consternation from the Apprehension of what according to his Account was yet to follow  It happen'd some time after this that the King of the Country dreamed a Dream which much perplex'd him and all the Magicians and Astrologers were sent for to interpret the said Dream but  Ali  was not sent for which grieved him much thinking that he was not esteem'd enough among the Princes of the Country and that he fear'd his having foretold the portentous Events of the late Meteor which were not yet determin'd by the time that he  predicted he was neglected as a Person that would not give any good Interpretation of the King's Dream However when  Ali  saw that the  Magicians  and Southsayers who were sent for gave the King no Satisfaction for they were confounded in their Accounts and differ'd one from another and the King was so angry that he was about to command them all to be put to Death with this he was comforted again and resolv'd to apply himself to the Palmtree to see if he could furnish himself with any Intelligence suitable to what he desir'd in which Case he would soon let the King know that though the rest of the  Magicians  could not answer his Desire he could supply that Defect and so he should gain more Reputation than if he had been sent for with the rest  Upon this he retires himself as usual into the Desart as before and comes to the Spot where he had the first Vision Here he surrounds the Tree fifteen times and every time calls the Spectre by his appointed Name three times over and as loud as his utmost extended Voice would admit when according to Direction he laid himself down with his Face to the South shut his Eyes and obsequiously waited till he fell asleep which was not long No sooner had his Senses forsaken him whether doz'd with any infernal Charm or otherwise the Account does not specify But I say no sooner was he asleep but the Vision appeared to his Fancy and asked him what was the Occasion of his coming  He answer'd That the King had dreamed a Dream and had told it to the Magicians whom he sent for in order to have them interpret his Dream but that he had not been sent for which was at first very grieving to him but that upon further Enquiry he found that the Magicians had given the  King no Satisfaction and that it had highly provoked him so that he was going once to have killed them all and that now he was glad he was not called but that if he could now put him into a Condition to interpret the King's Dream it would establish his Reputation for ever not with the King only but with the whole Country for that he was sure to be exalted to the highest Pitch of Honour that the King could give and besides all the People would adore him as one that had Intelligence among the Gods so that he should be had in the highest Reverence imaginable  The Vision assured him that he could not only qualify him to interpret the King's Dream but that he had made the King dream it on set Purpose to to give him Occasion to interpret and explain it and so he let him into the Particulars of what it was the King had dreamed and that the Dream being thus directed by him he likewise could direct him to such an Interpretation as none but himself could put upon it and so he at once told him both what the King dreamed and what Interpretation he should give of it adding that he would yet do greater things for him than those for that if he had Occasion to recommend himself to the King or to any other Person of Note he would put it into his Power at any time not only to tell the King what his Dream signified but should make the King Dream any thing that he thought fit so that he should be able to say to the King Tomorrow Night a deep Sleep shall come upon you and you shall dream so and so which Dream shall portend such and such things to you and your People  Ali  was exceedingly raised in his Thoughts upon such a Motion as this and you will not wonder  that he expressed tho' in his Sleep or Vision his high Satisfaction at such a Favour and from that time he entertained a constant Correspondence with this Vision or Apparition not being aware or perhaps not concerned that he was all this while conversing with the  Devil  and that the new Friendship he had engaged in was neither less or more than an immediate Correspondence with Hell  We have a Parallel Story to this and almost of the same kind of the Devil and an old  Arabian  in the Court of a  Pharaoh  King of  Aegypt  upon the Appearance of a Comet or Blazing Star and of which I shall give an Account in its Place  Nor was this any thing extraordinary in those Times 'twas natural to Satan's way of conversing with Mankind who had frequently midnight Thoughts injected to them by a supernatural Power that is by the evil Spirit without their knowing by what Hand they were injected and the  Devil  was able most certainly to give the Interpretation of those Thoughts which he had been the Occasion of  This whole Affair tho' remote in Time I give this Account of to suggest from it the probable Method which Satan has taken from the Beginning to insinuate himself into Mankind and as I said before to begin the Acquaintance which when once begun he took particular Care to cultivate to all the degrees of Intimacy possible so that in few Years such People have been as intimate with the  Devil  tho' perhaps not thoroughly knowing who it was they conversed with as they could desire to be  By this Method he found Opportunities upon all Occasions to bring Men to converse freely and fully with him and as he often furnished them with Materials and Subjects to amuse the rest of the  World with he was always able to oblige them in the utmost manner seeing nothing could be more to the Satisfaction of such People than the raising their Reputation in their Profession and giving a Sanction or Confirmation to their Predictions  I know it is doubted by many among the Learned whether the  Devil  has himself any Knowledge of Futurity and whether he can predict or foretell Events or any thing future and to come and this very Vision or Apparition supposing it to be true verifies the Opinion for he put the Alternative several times upon him that so if he miss'd giving a right Interpretation in one thing he might be sure in another and if one Conjecture should miss another might hit as you see in the Construction of the appearing Body of Fire  But the Question is needless here for if it be in the  Devil  's Power to inject the Subject of a Dream and put Thoughts into the Heads of those that are asleep 'tis then most certainly so far in his Power to give the Interpretation of those Thoughts to whom he pleases to grant such a Favour seeing the whole Scheme may be a meer Cheat and Delusion of the evil Spirit on purpose to form another Delusion namely that of bringing in a Conjurer or Dreamer of Dreams to interpret it This is indeed a true Piece of the Legerdemain of Hell and it may be called  the Devil turned Juggler  for 'tis so in the very Abstract and nothing else  All this is no great matter for Satan to do if we grant him only the Power of infusing Midnight Thoughts into the Mind which we have good reason to believe he is able enough to perform and yet have no great matter of Craft in him neither not so much as we are ordinarily willing to suppose the  Devil  is Master of The Variety is infinite that I might suppose the  Devil  is capable to  act among his Disciples by this piece of Cunning if we do but allow him so much and I cannot but say 'tis very clear to me that the  Devil  has a secret Power to inject innumerable things into our Heads by Dream and to make us dream almost what and when he pleases so as may best serve his Occasions and Ours too  And his Advantages are very great by this Fraud for he gives his Instrument such an undoubted Reputation for a Revealer of Secrets and an Interpreter of Dreams that nothing can be like it Not  Daniel  himself who they said had an excellent Spirit and that the Spirit of the Holy Gods was in him could do more for by this Means the Southsayer would be able to tell the Dreamer what it was he dreamed of as well as what it signified  If any Man doubt that the  Devil  can as I say infuse midnight Thoughts and whisper Suggestions by Dream of any kind to the Mind I refer him to Mr  Milton  who shews us the  Devil  in the Shape of a Toad crept close to  Eve  's Ear in her deepest Slumbers and injecting lustful or loose and wandering Thoughts into her chaste Mind I say chaste for such it was without doubt before and making her dream with Pleasure of the Sin which he resolved to allure her to commit the next Day and so prepare her for the Crime which till then her very Soul abhorred  This granted and the  Devil  being allowed such an Advantage over Mankind whether good or bad I cannot wonder either that he makes use of it at all or that he makes use of it in such a frequent and extraordinary manner as to bewitch and inspire his Friends and Favourites Nor that those Friends or Favourites of his whom he does thus assist make such corrupt uses of it as we find they do for insinuating an Opinion of themselves into the World for we find presently when this Familiarity  is once obtained with the Evil Spirit and they begin to act by his Instruction the first thing they do is to put a Fraud upon Mankind and make the World believe that all they did was from Heaven that they spoke by Inspiration and Revelation and that their Intelligence was immediately from the Gods to speak in the Language of thos  Times  Thus  Balaam  tells the King of  Moab  he can speak nothing but as God shall command him wherea  'tis plain had not the  Devil  been restrained from directing him at that time he would as heartily have cursed  Israel  as he blessed them and so have gained the Rewards of his Office which was the Wages of Divination but he confesses the Impotency of his Art when he found a Lock put upon hi  Tongue and the Key in the Hand of a supream Power I say he confesses the good Will he ha  to the Reward but the Weakness of his  BlackA  where Heaven interposed its Power  Numb  xxiii  Surely there is no Inchantment against Jacob neither is there any Divination against Israel  intimating that he had tryed the utmost of his Skill but could do nothing and in  ver    Behold I have receive  commandment to bless and he hath blessed and I cannot reverse it  Nothing can be plainer He would but the  Devil  and he together were not able to reverse the Blessing The only thing strange in this Story of  Balaam  is that God should thus suffer a Sorcerer and Inchanter a Witch or Dealer with the  Devil  to receive Commands from himself and to bid him go and do thus and thus and to meet him and put into his Mouth what he should say on that Occasion from whence some might insinuate that the Wizards and Magicians of those Days had a mutual or alternate Converse sometimes really with God himself and at other times with the  Devil  as if the Wretch were to day a  Man of God and tomorrow a Sorcerer Conjurer and an Instrument of the  Devil  and as if God would stoop to employ those who had so far stooped below the Dignity of reasonable Creatures as to converse with the  Devil    By this means the People also were the more easily subjected to the Abuse of the Conjurer and exposed to the Delusions of an evil Spirit not being able to know when he spoke from One or from the Other no doubt the Deluder would always pretend he spoke by the immediate Illumination of Heaven as he had sometimes really done so it would not be difficult to obtain the Opinion that he did always so  Now 'tis most certain that nothing can more assist the Delusions of the  Devil  in such cases as these than to have it entertained among the People that all the Inspiration is from Heaven even the Devil himself cannot desire a stronger Auxiliar it is an Assistance so natural to the Delusions which he is carrying on among Men that all his infernal Art cannot form an Equivalent to it And hence it came to pass  at least I believe so  that the  Devil  chose always that way of coming at the Senses of Mankind I mean by Vision and Dream by Voices in the Night and by Injections of Midnight Thoughts because God himself had made use of the same Means to inspire the Minds of Men with divine Ideas and the Devil by imitating the superior Revelations could not only enable his Magicians and Southsayers and such other Instruments of Delusion to impose their Cheats upon the People but could even delude and impose upon those Dreamers themselves too perswading them to believe their Inspirations were from Heaven and that they had such and such things revealed to them from the immediate Spirit of God when it was only a  Flatus  from Hell throwing them into Ecstasies  and as  Balaam  said  being in a Trance but with his Eyes open  that is to say possess'd with the Witchcraft of an evil Spirit as is said of the Maid in the  Acts c  xvi  ver  who had a Spirit of Divination and brought to her Master great Gain by Southsaying that is to say by speaking as the  Devil  dictated to her nay and the Text is plain in acknowledging that it was the  Devil  that possessed her for in the Original you have his Name what  Devil  it was and if you want a farther Explanation of him you may have it too his Name is called  PYTHON  and some of your Bibles supposing for once that you read any has it in their Margins what particular  Devil Python  was whether an avaritious a treacherous a deceiving  Devil  but some think it was the first because she hired out herself and her  Devil  with her to a Master and what she got by her  Devil  her Master was to make the best of the Terms much the same as a late  Irish  Mars married two Wives for then let them out again at so much a Year and took the Income of both their  Devils  for his Jointure A rare Bargain indeed and something akin I believe to the  Devil Python    How much were it to be wish'd that some of our Southsaying Wits who are really neither wise Men or Southsayers Magicians or Conjurers and who will have us in spite of our Senses believe that they are really inspired could but tell us too with any moderate Certainty whether those Inspirations are from God or the  Devil  Whether the F  ghts of their Insipids are Ecstasies of the Adored or of the Horrid whether when they rail at Heaven and burlesque their Maker we may not really believe they are overrul'd by a divine Influence to do it with so ill a Grace and so little common Sense that it may be directed to exalt the Allwise by the very  means used to expose him and to make them mix Impudence with so much Ignorance that others equally wicked but of better Judgment may grow sick of the Crime for the meer Deficiency of the Wit  Doubtless He that knows how to serve the best Ends by the worst Means can leave the meanest Heads and the most brainless Wits to be thus wicked to intimate to others the Weakness of the Crime and the gross Absurdity of Atheism I don't therefore think it at all prophane at least if not so intended to say Such a Fellow is one of Godamighty's simple One's by which I would be always understood that he is one to whom Heaven has denied the Gift of Brains and suffer'd the  Devil  to fill up the empty Spaces in his Head with a Share of glaring Impudence such as will pass for Wit with those that have none and for the worst of Folly with all the rest of Mankind  This sort of wise Men of whom the Age is plentifully stored at this time are doubtless plac'd up and down in proper Stations by the Allowance of Providence for the Conviction of Mankind in their particular Spheres just as the  Devil  himself has in many cases been a Preacher of Truth and will be so to the End of the World tho' sore against his Will  Of so much Force is Ironical Righteousness that the blackest Agents are fittest to be made the brightest Examples of it since also the greatest and best Principles are often illustrated by their most infamous and consequently by their compleatest Contraries  But to go back where I left off The  Devil  who has always had the Impudence to mimick his Maker and sometimes to personate him too in his Applications to Mankind has made I say his first Acquaintance with him by this Method of  Dream and Midnight Vision for that very Reason  viz  because it is the Method by which God himself often used to reveal himself to the Prophets and other his most eminent Servants of old as instanc'd before in  Abraham  and of which the Scripture has many Examples I hope that Book when 'tis taken as a History only may obtain Credit enough to be brought in Evidence I have mentioned  Abraham  already and perhaps it may be offer'd that this is not sufficient because God conversed as the Text says in another Place Face to Face with  Abraham  but take it then with his Grandson  Jacob  God appeared to  Jacob Gen  xxviii in his Dream of the Ladder reaching up to Heaven And behold the Lord stood above it and said  I am the Lord God of Abraham thy Father  But if this will not do neither then take it with one who it might be as likely should have the  Devil  appear to him as God himself but still 'twas the same thing  Gen  xx  God came to Abimelech in a Dream  So might the  Devil  too for  Abimelech  was an Idolater And again  ver    And God said unto him in a Dream  Now  Abimelech  was a  Philistin  of the cursed Race destined to Destruction by the Posterity of  Abraham  and yet God appeared to him or came to him in a Dream and spoke to him in a Dream  From hence the  Devil  who is cunning enough to imitate all those Methods of Access to the Minds of Man which 'tis possible for him to come at him by and which his Maker has used for the like Communications has always made use of this Method and when he has designed the Delusion or the perplexing of Mankind or any other of his infernal Infatuations he has brought them to pass by the Injection of evil Thoughts or other dark Means moving his Passions and Affections instilling all the hellish Imaginations that are requisite to the Mischiefs he designs And thus you have the Circumstances  and the Reason too of the  Devil  's way of working with Mankind  It remains a Question tho' of no extraordinary Importance what Shape or Form the  Devil  made use of in his first acquainting himself with Mankind It is Satan's Misfortune to say no worse of him that he cannot appear in his own Figure cloathed with any of his native Beauties but that it would render him so frightful to his Emissaries and even his best Friends and most useful Servants would be terrified and would run away from him instead of conversing with him and the most accurate Magician or Southsayer in  Arabia  would instead of going into the Deserts and Wilderness to meet him abhor the very Place and tremble at the Thought of seeing him  Hence to whisper to them in the Night and only talk in Vision and Appearance is the kindest thing the  Devil  can do to them as well as the wisest way for himself for was he ever to appeal  I say  in his own Cloaths none of his Friends would ever come to receive his second Visit Now his coming in the Night or in Dream as is hinted in the Story of the Magician above is certainly needful for as in a Dream the Voice without the Vision is sufficient so if a Shape is represented to the Imagination in the Sleep it sooner wears off and the Impressions are sooner raz'd out of the Mind than if the Apparition was visible with open Eyes and in the Light of the Day there's a great deal of difference between what we really see and what we only dream we did see  We have indeed some of  Balaam  's Dreamers that is to say who dream with their Eyes open indeed some of them may be said to be always in a Dream they are scarce any thing but Apparition themselves their whole Lives are a kind of moral Delusion and as they live in a Dream so we  must dream too to make any thing of them for they never are what they seem to be or seem to be what they are But as I may perhaps endeavour to discover those People to the World a little plainer than I can discover them to themselves I say no mor  of them in this Place leaving the  Devil  and them to act in Concert awhile that they may illustrate and be Foils to one another  It is true that by this way of dealing in Dreams the  Devil  has infinite Advantage for the making C  njurers that is to say Magicians and Southsayers in the World Whether that sort of People have been of any Use to him for the propagating his Interest in the World is a Question by it self  That the  Devil  took this Method for the first establishing himself in the World and as I call'd it making his Acquaintance with Mankind I have taken Notice of already How useful he has found his newmade Friends and how apt to carry on his Business and especially for the farther extending his Power and propagating the Delusions of others History will inform us and we cannot doubt but he has found his Advantage in it But it remains a Question of Importance still undecided whether are best pleased in these nocturnal Operations the Devil or the Magician my Opinion is for the first I believe indeed the  Devil  has got the better of them in the main and whereas he at first was mighty eager to make his Acquaintance among them and glad of the Means he seems now to have overreached them and to have worked them up to a Desire after the Correspondence in such a manner that the subtle Manager is not so cheap to be had since but makes Bargains nay brings them up to his own Terms and sometimes tells them plainly he has no Occasion for them but on the other hand if they want him they must give him his own Price and do what he conditions with them for or else he has no more to say to them tho' he is a Cheat in that too  Thus like a cunning Chap he turns his Back and is gone knowing very well that they will call him again and give him his Price yield to his Demand and rather sell themselves to him  Soul  and  Body  as we are told is now very frequent than go without his Assistance This is all owing to his Subtilty and Mankind's Folly and Fondness for had they stood as they did at first he must have come to their Conditions but he found the way to make himself necessary to them and to please them and he managed accordingly  It is indeed an Evidence how shrewdly the  Devil  overreached Mankind in the most early Ages of the World For  First  as I mentioned before this was to come to them with some Authority and with the Magnificence of a God and it always gave them an Awe and kind of Reverence of his Appearance  Secondly  it really so far prevail'd with them that we have a great deal of Reason to believe they did not always know whether their Intelligence was from Above or from Below and whether they were conversing with God or with the  Devil  If this is true as I have no Reason to question I have less Reason to doubt that he often deluded them to think the former And thus perhaps many false Prophets in former times came to the poor People and began their Predictions with the usual Preface  Thus saith the Lord  when in Justice they ought to have begun with  Thus saith the Devil  as they might easily have seen afterwards by the Consequence of it and by the nature of their Prediction for I believe that way it is most easily discovered  The Discovery seems indeed to be directed by this very Method where the Scripture says  If a Prophet comes shews Signs and Wonders  and then adds  go serve other Gods  his very Doctrine proves him to be an Impostor and on that very Account  he is to be rejected God's Prophets will always teach God's Truths a false Prophet is easily known by his Teachings the  Devil  may deceive for a while but even the  Devil  himself cannot hold it long the cloven Principle will appear which I suppose the Fable of the cloven Foot to be an Emblem of and no more  But to come back to the Example of the Magician going into the Desart why the very Place was a Branch of that Complication of Fraud which constituted all the rest The Man went thither first casually fell asleep by the natural Consequence of his Weariness and under the Palmtree as customary to preserve him by its Shade the rest was all a Cheat the  Devil  could as well have made him dream and see the Vision in his Chamber at  Susa  or where else he dwelt in  Persia  or  Arabia  as in the Wilderness but he catch'd him there and took that Advantage to introduce the Ceremony of his future corresponding and therefore he appoints him to come again to the same Place and there gives him the Formality of Measures to be observed he must make his Tour fifteen times round the Tree he must call him by what infernal Title he was pleased to give himself and this to be done three times every Circuit he made about the Tree and when all this was done as he might well be inclined to do he was to lie down and go to sleep And what need all this Cookery but to dish up the Delusion with a due Form give a Sanction to the Vision itself and command a suitable Regard to the Audience which he had the Honour to be admitted to  If this had not been the case it might as well have all been transacted any where else but Satan finds his Account in these things For during many Ages after this and perhaps in other Places the Southsayers and Magicians of  Arabia  went out in the  Night and into the Wilderness and Solitary Places to meet with their Inspirations and to dream Dreams and then came back stor'd and qualify'd to make their Predictions as much as to say they go to their Palmtrees to meet Visions there they met their  Devil  and then came back and spread their Delusions as their Instructor had furnish'd them  Semiramis  it seems and we may suppose her Successors in the  Babylonian  Monarchy kept several Sets of these People and as they had their several Denominations so they had their several Offices and Employments under her As particularly her  wise Men  or  Magicians  these were to explain to her the Aspect of the Heavens the probable Effects of all surprizing Phaenomena in Nature her  Astrologers  and  Southsayers  and these were employ'd to consult their private Devils and were Revealers of Secrets Interpreters of Dreams  c  and then they had  Wizards  and  Sorcerers  and such as used Inchantments and these foretold the Success of her Military Enterprizes expounded Omens the Signs and Circumstances of Creatures the flying of Birds Voices Apparitions and all such things as were particularly uneasy or disturbing to the Queen or to her Court and wanted their Explaining The first of these I have voted already to be honest Men but the last two I make no doubt consulted with the Devil and the Devil with them upon all Occasions Nor do I doubt at all but that they made Prodigies and then explain'd their Meaning as I said before that they appointed Dreams on purpose and for the sake of interpreting them of which I shall give you another Account hereafter  Sometimes it seems these conjuring enchanting People were so far from explaining things to the Queen's Mind or interpreting things after the manner that she expected that her Majesty was pleas'd to dispatch them out of her way and hang them  by Dozens And thus  Nebuchadnezzar  commanded all the  wise Men  of  Babylon  to be put to Death tho' it does not appear that his Commands were executed nor are we certain they were not but 'tis evident it was very much the Custom to do so  Hence I suppose they were generally inclin'd like the Prophets in the case of King  Ahab  to take care and prophesy nothing but what should please the King And when  Micaiah  a true Prophet or Prophet of God came to tell the King what really came to pass we see what his Fate had been if the King had outliv'd the Battle  Nor to this Day do the Princes of the East make any scruple to truss up their Conjurers and Southsayers when they find them juggle with them and find they cheat and impose upon them an admirable Method to deal with the Broachers of Atheistical Deistical and Enthusiastic Whymsies in our Age where we have  a more sure Word of Prophesy  which we are commanded to take heed to and which the modern Agents of the  Devil  are only employ'd to counteract and drive out of the World if possible that the old Oracles of Devilworship and other Delusions might be again introduc'd  But I am loth to seem vindictive in my Notions nor would I set up Fire and Faggot no not against the  Devil  and his Agents they may have enough of that hereafter with the Devil and his Angels And besides such a Persecution must necessarily at this time be so bloody that I know not what City or Town Inns of Court Palace College or University  our own excepted  which it would not almost lay waste desolate and make void of Inhabitants Mercy on us persecute and punish Men for being Atheists and Deists for dividing the Trinity and unsanctifying the Holy Ghost who is the Sanctifier of the World and such difficult Trifles as these  where would it end and what would become of all the religious Part of the World what a Schism in the most literal Sense would this make among us and where is there a Church Chappel Meetinghouse or Congregation that would not be divided against it self and set up a new Body of Dissenters Truly so as dissenting not from this or that Opinion of Religion but from all Religion and all Opinions in Religion whatsoever  Well let the Church of  Rome  send Protestants to Heaven by the Rack and the Gibbet I would not be instrumental to send all the Atheists and Arians to the  Devil  no not for the sake of my Native Country for fear of laying waste the Glebe and leaving Posterity no body to instruct them better  CHAP V  A Farther Account of the  Devil  's Conduct in Imitating Divine Inspirations Something of the Difference between them and particularly of Signs and Wonders False as well as True and the Cheats of the Former  HAVING observ'd how the  Devil  in the Infancy of his Correspondence with Mankind came to him and made his Acquaintance by the same Method that God was pleas'd to reveal himself on Occasions of the greatest Importance it would be very much to the Advantage of our present Enquiry if we could come at some more Particulars in the respective Appearances and know something of the Difference in them that so for the Future we might distinguish our Modern Inspirations and not oblige the  Devil  so much or his Favourites either as to flatter their Vanity with thinking they are divinely  inspired when as I said before they are on  deluded with the Enthusiasms of Hell and impos'd upon by Mother  Eve  's Toad at their Ears that  to say by the Whispers of the  Devil    That God was pleas'd to reveal himself to h  Servants of old by Vision and Dream is eviden  besides the Examples mention'd before from h  own Declaration that this was the way he resolv'  to transact with them Numb xii  If there be  Prophet among you I the  LORD  will make my se  known to him in a Vision and will speak unto him i  a Dream My Servant Moses is not so  that is to say was more than so  with him will I speak Mouth  Mouth even apparently and not in dark Speeches  c  This is a noted Declaration of the Manner how God would discover himself to his Servants and we cannot doubt but the  Devil  who knew it very well did quickly imitate the like Method and bring in a thousand Delusions at the same Door It being in his Power as I have said to inject Midnight Thoughts and Amusements and make his Appearances in Vision and Dream as he pleas'd how near he might come to imitate the Visions and Revelations of God is what I cannot undertake to determine I am sure 'tis more than probable that he might do so in a manner as might deceive those unguarded Persons to whom he often thus appear'd and whose Ends in seeking him out might be almost as wicked as his that appear'd to them  It may be something too much in the Favour of the Pretenders to  new Light and Prophesies  and to the ancient Revelations and Discoveries made by false Prophets properly so call'd in the holy sacred Writings but I cannot answer it to my own Reason if I should say that I believe they all knew and every time too when they said  thus saith the Lord  that it was false that they told a wilful premeditated Lye and that they ought to have said Thus saith our sovereign Lord the  Devil    Nor will I venture to say that all the Modern Heathens the  Druids  among the  Britains  the Priests of the Heathen Temples who uttered the Oracles of the  Devil  however they came by them or the  Bramans  and strictest Recluses of the  Indians  the  Dervises  of  Mahomet  and the like do all actually know that is to say by immediate Communications from Hell and the Instrumentality of its Agents that they really are Confederate with the great Enemy of Mankind and carrying on a Correspondence with the  Devil  I have so much Opinion of the Power of common Sense in Man as a human Creature and so much Charity for the good Meaning of those who we do not find immediately vile profligate and immoral as to think they would not act with  Satan  upon that foot  I have much more Reason to think the four Ecclesiasticks of  Switzerland  in the Story  Jetzer  acted with Satan openey'd and openfac'd when they propos'd to the poor foolish Creature to renounce God and Jesus Christ and so to carry on the Fraud they had begun with a kind of Sanction instead of an Oath of Secresy and it appear'd indeed to be so at last  But certainly as in other Cases abundant Paralels might be brought The  Devil  who generally acts in Disguse has carry'd those Disguises so artfully that I doubt not but many of his false Prophets long before our times have said  thus saith the Lord  with a good Grace  that is  with a real Belief that God had spoken to them or as was the Language of the Scripture Times had spoken by them when really it was the Voice of the  Devil  and of no body else And let not our Modern Enthusiasticks take this to be said only in Favour of themselves I am not come so far down in the course of my Work so much as to think of them no not of St  Dunstan  St  Francis  or of the more  eminent Deceiver St  Ignatius  the greatest Enthusiastick of the last ten Centuries when I come to them we shall reckon as we meet  But I am yet talking of the specifick Difference between the Inspirations of false Prophets the Dreams whisper'd and suggested by the  Devil  and those on the other hand from the contrary Appearances of the good Spirit that is to say of God himself I am in the first place to intimate that they are not always to be discern'd no nor easy to be discern'd if they were there would not be so many Delusions in the World as have been for the Men are not all  Devils  before they come to him they don't come to him resolving to be deceiv'd and intending to deceive every Body they are concern'd with I must own I do not think that all the four hundred Priests of  Baal  whom  Elijah  summon'd together to the great Sacrifice at Mount  Carmel  would have shew'd so many antick Tricks leaping upon the Altar cutting themselves with Knives and crying  O Baal hear us  if they had believ'd they were under a Delusion of the  Devil  all the while and that  Baal  was no Body but a dead Stock a lifeless Image without Sense to hear much more without Power to answer They must certainly believe that  Baal  was a Something or a Somebody whom it was their Duty to pay a Homage and Reverence to or that they paid that Homage to the true God through the Medium of an Image a sort of a Model of that meaner and more ignorant  Idolatry  call'd Popery  But to look forward beyond this Image of Idolworship we have the old false Prophets coming much nearer to the true and the Inspirations bearing an Affinity in a more significant Point and that is in  Signs  and  Wonders  or what we call Mircales which yet may be all from the  Devil  so hard it is for the deceiv'd false Prophet  to know when he is right and when he is wrong and so easy is it for him to be impos'd upon himself and consequently to delude the People he converses with  The  Devil  as far as his Agency of this kind will reach must certainly be mightily pleas'd with it for by thus inspiring his Tools not only to the degree of false Prophets but to an Ability of working Miracles showing Signs and Wonders whether Real or Imaginary he not only the more effectually imposes upon his false Prophets but gives or deputes so much of  Devil  to them as to make them able to delude and deceive others nay to deceive the whole World or as the Text expresses it  Matt  xxiii to deceive if it were possible  the very Elect    'Tis remarkable in this same Text that it is predicted there shall come false Christs and false Prophets Devils or Devil's Agents and shall shew great Signs and Wonders  There is also another Text which gives us a Caution against such tho' I do confess I can't see how it can be made use of till the Delusion has gone some Length and that is in  Deut  xiii  If there arise among you a  Prophet  or a  Dreamer of Dreams  and giveth thee a Sign or a Wonder and the Sign or the Wonder come to pass  Now this I say requires so much time as to the fulfilling the Token or Prediction of the false Prophets till when and till the false Doctrine which he preaches shall detect him the People are manifestly in danger of the Delusion for as in all such Cases in those ancient Times every Novelty was confirm'd by Signs and Wonders What could be more deluding and more apt to impose upon the People than to have the Shewer of those Signs and Wonders confirm his Teachings by a Miracle and that the Miracle should come to pass Yet all this may attend  the lying Wonders of a  Magician  a false Prophet nay of a  Devil  That such Wonders ma  be wrought as are justly term'd false and lying Wonders we have again predicted  Thes  ii  which Text I doubt touches a little our holy Father the Pope whose coming is said to be after the working of  Satan  with all Power and Signs and  lying Wonders  intimating that there are Wonders which are Delusive said to be wrought but not wrought  a la Mode the Legend the Fables of Monkery the Devil of  London and the like Wonders indeed c  scarce be called lying upon any other Foundation for if they were real and actually perform'd ho  can they then be lying but if promis'd to be perform'd and not done or said to be really perform  and done but were not then they are inde  Lyes or lying Wonders and take them which wa  we will I doubt as before and leave my Master  the Jesuites to bring his Holiness off their ow  way  But I come on upon modern Time too fast H  +story demands that we advance by just degrees an  to that purpose I must look a little more particularly into the Antiquity of these things SATAN to give the  Devil  his due did not manage with so little Dexterity his first Acquaintances with Mankind as to suffer his secret Methods to be discover'd and detected or his Instruments to be expos'd On the contrary he put innumerable Wonders upon Mankind acted with inextricable Stratagem and Art from which Dexterity and the difficulty of explaining his Management the common Operations of his Favourites obtain'd the Sanction of Devilish and the ART they used obtain'd the honourable Title of BLACK and this according to my Title is what I am now to describe  The World was now so much improv'd in Knowlegde that as I hinted above nothing new could be  started but a Miracle was presently enquir'd after to confirm it and he that could do the most eminent things of that kind was the most famous in their Opinion  Mopsus  was a Southsayer and said to be the Son of  Apollo  He was in such Credit and Esteem in his time that it grew into a Proverb to be  as infallible as  Mopsus  This  Mopsus  meeting one  Chalchas  a Man likewise eminent in the same devilish Profession they fell into Dispute about some things relating to their ART  Mopsus  ask'd  Chalchas  how many Figs such a wild Figtree as he pointed out to him had upon it the Southsayer  Chalchas  would not answer him but alledg'd that it was not a fair Question Upon which  Mopsus  told him the Number and upon counting them up it was found true to a Fig upon which  Chalchas  was so confounded not being able to conceive how it was perform'd that tho' the thing was trifling he died for Grief  It seems  Chalchas  had his Fortune told him by the Oracle  viz  that he should dye when he found out a better Southsayer than himself all which I can resolve into nothing but this that  Mopsus  had more Favour with the  Devil  than  Chalchas  at least at that time and that he whisper'd the Number of the Figs in his Ear or to clear up the Juggle  Mopsus  had counted them before and so the Question was a Juggle in it self which indeed was the most likely of the two  The Humour of the Times being as I said to require Miracles and Wonders the Southsayers and Dreamers of Dreams bestirr'd themselves and sought out every Man his own Way for secret Inspirations and Illuminations and the  Devil  was very useful to them on many Occasions till at last he found the Work encreas'd upon his Hands and he was oblig'd to set up DelusionOffices as I may call them and give out Answers at the  Shrines of the People's Idols and in the Names of their Gods  These were so far from crying down the Office or Dignity of a Southsayer in the World that it rather encreast their Fame For as the Number of those Oracles were but few not above twelve or fourteen great and small so the  wise Men  the  Magicians  and  Southsayers  were often sent by their respective Princes whose Favourites they were to those Oracles on extraordinary Occasions and to be resolved in their Doubts whence they frequently brought such Answers as they knew would please and oblige the Prince that sent them perhaps as best suited the Circumstances of those Princes and which those so sent best knew whether the Oracle gave such Answers or no the latter being not always necessary  This working by Miracle seldom or never fail'd it confounded the Understandings of Men and when any of their Southsayers had once obtain'd an Esteem by such a Performance he never wanted any thing more to continue his Character and to gain him Admittance into the Favour and Court of the greatest Princes Hence  Joseph  's telling  Pharaoh  's Chief Butler and Chief Baker their Dreams and those Dreams exactly coming to pass open'd the Doors of the Prison for him as his adding to it that of telling the Interpretation of  Pharaoh  's Dream advanc'd him to the second Chariot and to the crying  Abrek  before him that is  Bow the Knee    'Tis the Opinion of some Learned in the Wisdom of the  Aegyptians  that  Joseph  continued the Art of Southsaying for in that the Wisdom of the  Aegyptians  chiefly consisted for a great while after and I acknowledge my self to be of that Opinion whether I am learned in the Wisdom of the  Aegyptians  or no and that he had never been continued in such a high Post so long if he had not  For this Reason those Words he used afterwards to his Brethren  Wot you not that such a Man as I can Divine  are a kind of Admiration that is to say Are you so ignorant in the Customs of this Country as not to know that a Man in my Post must be able  certainly to divine  Gen xliv  And indeed without putting any strain'd or constrain'd Meaning upon the Sacred Text I cannot doubt but that the People of  Aegypt  took  Joseph  to be what they call'd the Prince of the  Magicians  of the East that is to say one of the Chief of them and extraordinarily qualify'd by the Gods for the Understanding deep Mysteries for diving into hard Questions interpreting Dreams and resolving Doubts In a word in the same Sense that  Daniel  almost a thousand Years after was esteem'd at  Babylon viz  that the Spirit of the Holy Gods was in him whether they meant by their Gods the Crocodile or the River  Nile  or the Great Calf at the  Aegyptian Thebes  or  Isys  or  Osyris  that I shall not enquire into here but they doubted not that some of the best and brightest of their Deities inspir'd  Joseph  with an Excellent Spirit  Nor was it unreasonable for the poor People under the dark Circumstances of that Age to believe so of him for how else should he have the Foreknowledge of the dreadful Famine seven Years before it came how that Sagacity to gather such immense Quantities of Corn in the plentiful Years before it and lay it up in such Places and in such Proportions and so secur'd as to supply suitably the whole Country of  Aegypt  so vastly extended and so populous as it was at that time  How  Joseph  came by all this Knowledge and Wisdom they as we have like reason to believe were as ignorant of as they were positive that it was so by some means or other and therefore it was no Absurdity for them to suggest that he did all  by Divination that is to say by Enchantment or secret Converse with the Spirits of another World or as we call it with more Propriety at least in our Opinion that he dealt with the  Devil  and that this was done by the Charm of the Silver Cup which was put in the Mouth of  Benjamin  's Sack  That they believ'd so is evident from the Words of the same Chap  Gen  xliv Is not this it in which my Lord drinketh  and whereby he divineth  The Words are fully explain'd by the Customs and Usage of the  Magicians  and  Devilhunters  in those Days who used strange Gestures and clanging Sounds such or not much unlike such as our old Women now use to hive their Bees by these they call'd the familiar  Devils  the  Pythons  and  Apollyons  of their Acquaintance about them whatever Occasions made it necessary for them to speak with them  That  Joseph  knew better and that he certainly neither used such Methods or convers'd with any such kind of Foreigners or Infernals was most certain but his Steward was directed to speak in the Language of the Country nor would he have talk'd to have been understood if he had not and this confirms the Conjecture as above and makes it most reasonable namely that all  Aegypt  took him  Joseph  to be a Southsayer or wise Man and that certainly he could Divine  This Part of  Joseph  's Story is useful to explain by what manner of Communication the Diviners of those days used to maintain their Acquaintance with the Infernals and how mean and scandalous Methods the  Devil  contriv'd to settle his Correpondence that in short by the clanging of an old Kettle or Brasspot the whole Hive of  Devils  should be alarm'd be told that some of their Masters on Earth had occasion for them or as we  call it wanted to speak with them and that they should immediately fly to hand and mount to the Place to know the Business  This will be a very material Point to discuss more fully and to explain the Philosophy of if we should come to examine the most accurate and polite Methods of that particular Art which we call raising the  Devil  of which so many valiant old Women have been compleatly Mistresses and that so eminently that Satan durst no more refuse to attend the Call or fail of his Duty when he heard the Summons than a Schoolboy that has been well lash'd for playing Truant dares do it again before his Backside has done smarting For doubtless the Scolding of an old Woman and upon such a Disappointment too would be enough to terrifie the  Devil  himself if he has any Sense of that outrageous Animal call'd an old Witch upon his Mind  But I leave that Part to a particular Dissertation upon the Species when I shall learnedly and politely examine and if practicable determine for the good of Mankind the two following Wehigty and Important Difficulties  First  Whether upon an immergent and sudden Occasion the Musick also being the same old Mother  Anthony  of in the County of could not be as effectual with her Voice to hive a Swarm of Bees as any Brass Kettle or Warmingpan in all the Village and so both frugally save her Neighbours from the risque of bruising their Housholdstuff and the said Mother  Anthony  instead of being liable to the Duckingstool for a common Disturber become a useful Servant to her King and Country and enjoy a Pension for her good Offices  Secondly  Whether the same Mother  Anthony  according to the Hypothesis of  Joseph  's Cup of Divination  might not be also made useful in her Generation upon like extraordinary Occasions to lay the  Devil  and that too by the same Rules that others raise him since the Bees in their greatest Hurries and Tumults are quieted as above by the same Noise which at another time would fret and disorder them the Philosophy of which is not yet understood nor can the Reason of it be discover'd in all the Philosophical Transactions or Transactors who have so long studied it From whence they say the Tinkers beating their Pans when they publish their Occupations or as we call it vulgarly in  England Cry their Trades  are extreamly uneasy to all the old Women above their ninth Climacteric and unsufferable to those who are engaged in the Article of Circlemaking and Pawwawing insomuch that if a Tinker should have stop'd in a Village and beat his Kettle above a certain limited time at or within hearing of the Town of  pswich  in Mother  Lackland  's time she would have been obliged to have raised the  Devil  for her Assistance But this I leave to Experiment  As I say these two important Questions may take up a large Tract by themselves and as they must needs be of vast Consequence to the Readers I doubt not the Booksellers who are generally Publickspirited Gentlemen will embrace the Opportunity of publishing such a valuable Piece for the Good of the Nation so I shall adjourn it for the present  Come we next in order according to the Contents of this Chapter to the particular Question in what Shape the  Devil  appeared to the first Magicians or the Inchanters of the most early Times and the Answer is as far as we can yet learn that he did  ot assume any Shape or visible Appearance at all whether it was his Modesty or his Policy is a Question has been a little tho' not fully discuss'd and  those that speak most favourably of Satan think it was the first for in the early Times of his Intimacy he might be loth perhaps to expose himself to his new Acquaintance whereas afterwards when he became really a familiar Spirit in the litteral Sense of the Word he made no Difficulty to converse with his Favourites more openly see and be seen of which in its Place  But if this was not the Case it seems to me that at first and while being only a Night Visiter he communicated himself by Vision and Dream only there was no manner of Occasion for the Locality of his Person and for a real Appearance nor if his Business was done was it material whether he deliver'd it by his own Mouth or by the Voice of any of his trusty and wellbeloved Angels and Agents who are certainly as capable to officiate in his Place as if he was there in Person  Besides as much a Spirit as the  Devil  is we have Reason to believe he is so far from being Omnipresent that he would not be able to dispatch a thousandth Part of the Business he has upon his hands if he had not a  innumerable number of Deputy Representative  Devils  always at his hand to execute his Commissions and make their Appearance for him when and as often as the meanest of the Southsaying Inchanting Race calls him  And for this Reason it might be that  Ali Albrahazen  as is said above in the first Intimacies betwixt him and the Favourite Spirit who spoke to him in Dream had a Name given by which he was to be called three times at every Round of the Palmtree Circle which when he had rehearsed the  Devil  that is to say that particular Deputy  Devil  which was appointed to wait upon him was always to attend and be ready Whether that said particular Spirit was bound to his due and daily Attendance for that one Occasion History has not yet  determined I have only to say that if it was so Friend  Ali  must be a Magician of some Quality that had a whole  Devil  to attend him personally and singly who was allowed to do no other Business but just wait to receive his Orders and give back the Instructions which  Ali  might stand in need of unless perhaps now and then he might go upon some other Errands where the Occasion was extraordinary  We are told that in  America  and in some Nations in  Africa  the Magicians or Wizards and Pawaws found Ways and Means to converse with Satan Face to Face as particular Occasions requir'd and that from the Beginning of Time for perhaps his Conversation in those remote Countries might be as antient as it was any where  Aegypt  and  Arabia  excepted  It is said also that he does appear in those Countries and upon certain Times or Occasions in human Shape sometimes in one Posture sometimes in another as Circumstances may vary as sometimes he appears angry and frightful surrounded with Fire pr  ceded with Tempest and the like terrifying Objects to let the People know that he can hurt them sometimes in Smiles and sweet spicey Perfumes and preceded by Music and Melody in the Air to let them know he is pleased  'Tis true it was late in the World before we in these Parts knew any thing of it and it might be so also before he begun those Practices there they were too gross to go down with the first Ages when the Knowledge of God was not so entirely obliterated from the Minds of Men as it was afterwards But Idolatry had prevailed to such a degree in  America  that the  Devil  was perhaps the only God they had heard any thing of for some thousands of Years But I return to my Subject  Except in those and such like remote and unacquainted Parts of the World we do not find much Evidence of the Magicians seeing or conversing with evil Spirits of whatever Kind or Quality in the Shapes of Men or Women Gods Angels indeed who are in sacred Text called the  Heavenly Host  are and have been frequently allowed to make their Appearance and have been sent hither on immediate and special Business as to  Abraham  to  Jacob  to  Moses  to the Father of  John  the Baptist to the Virgin  Mary  to the Shepherds at the Birth to our Saviour himself on divers Occasions and to the Women at the Sepulcher at the Resurrection and at the Ascension  Perhaps this may be the Reason why the  Devil  has kept his distance he remembers no doubt his former Rencounters with  Uriel  and with  Gabriel  or other Angels no matter who mentioned by Name in Mr  Milton  and how they drove him about from one Part of the Waste to another out of Heaven out of Paradise and every where else where they and he happen'd to meet and doubtless he does not much care to rencounter them  What Shape or Figure he appeared in when he came to tempt his Maker and our Saviour at that time himself in a State of Personality as Flesh and Blood as it is not expressed so I will not pretend to make a Guess at it 'Tis plain when he was at any time cast out of the poor distemper'd People by our Saviour or by his Disciples tho' he came evidently out of the Demoniac or Possessed yet he did not come out visibly and in Shape but walking off like a detected Thief in the dark and imperceptible he always play'd out of sight  The same Method I believe he took with all sorts of People in the World for some Ages especially at the Beginning of Time and would all our possessed or professed Dealers with this cunning  Manager act in the Dark and keep him to themselves that we might not see their Instructor or be acquainted with the Instructions their Witchery and Craft of Hell would I believe be much less hurtful to the World than it is  But now it seems as if our modern Magicians acted upon another foot that they do not go to the  Devil  but the  Devil  comes to them they do not go to him in the Desarts and Retreats of the Dark for Directions and Instructions but he acts with them in Concert and there is a kind of mutual Cohabitation they go on hand in hand and are FellowAgents both Principals and both Accessaries only with this usual difference on the  Devil  's side  viz  if they happen to do any capital Mischief so as to bring them to the Gallows he always leaves the Hanging Part to them there he as we say slips his Neck out of the Collar and is gone  This subtle Agreement in Mischief between the Magician and the Spirit that acts with him is not at all for the Advantage of Mankind and the Magicians of the former Mould seem to have been much the less hurtful kind for they generally were known to be what they pretended and were only made use of by People when they wanted 'em and for what was requir'd of them so they had their Pay and Wages of Unrighteousness and you had done with them  But here we converse with the Men knowing nothing of what they are and do not see the  Devil  that is within them so we deal with the  Devil  at second hand as we may call it that is we talk to him in disguise make Bargains and Contracts with him and that some of the worst kind by the Agency of these Magicians and see not the evil Spirit who is all the while both Director and Principal in all the Affair Thus far for  those Magicians who really deal in secret with him and this is that Magick which we call the  Black Art  that is to say a secret undiscover'd Conspiracy between Satan and those Agents of his which apply to him for Direction and then their acting again by those Directions to abuse impose upon and deceive Mankind  CHAP VI  Of who were the first Practicers of  Magick  as a Diabolical Art and how it was handed on to the  Aegyptians  and  Phoenicians  where it was first openly encouraged  THE Writers upon this Subject before me seem to have all been at a loss to six the Original of  Magick  as an  Art Diabolical  and they would fain have us believe it was in Practice in the Antediluvean World This I have not denied nor shall I deny it still but granting the  Devil  to have a Conquest upon the first Woman and by her Weakness and Treachery drawing her Husband into the same Snare we may give up all their Race for as black as Hell could make them And indeed the sacred Text describes them in Terms as black as can well be expressed  Gen  vi God looked upon the Earth and behold  it was corrupt  for  all Flesh had corrupted his way upon the Earth  and  ver    The Earth is filled with Violence  and  ver  speaking of Man  the Imagination of the Thought of his Heart was only Evil continually  and  the Wickedness of Man was great upon the Earth  upon this Account I say I gave up all that Race in the Beginning of this Work and be it so or be it only supposed to be so 'tis much the same nor is it  disputing with any Body if the  Devil  had the  agement of them as 'tis evident he had much  ess could not be expected let that part go  But my Question has been all along not what was done  before  but  since  the Deluge and how did  Satan  introduce himself to the  postdiluvean  Ages when and where with whom and in what manner did he make his first Acquaintance and breaking in upon Mankind for a second Possession or Management of Art  I mention'd  Zoroaster  slain in Battle by  Semirami  and  Prometheus  and others and very early they were and I stand by my Account of them that they were the first  Magicians  as the Word or Term  Magician  imply'd a Man of Learning of Wit and more than common Understanding searching after Knowledge studying the Rudiments and first Precepts and Principles of Philosophy But we are now in Search after another sort of People who tho' they were Searchers into Knowledge too yet look'd into it in another manner and for other Purposes namely who searched deeper into things and into deeper things I mean searching into HELL it self who began first to enter upon Diabolical Enquiries into the infernal Mysteries and Arts of the  Devil  and where those begun it is not so easy to find out  Some Authors as  Serenus  and  Cassianus  from him and the learned Sir  Walter Raleigh  from both hand down this fabulous Original for our Speculation  viz  that  Ham  or  Cham  the Son of  Noah  having practised those superstitious and sacrilegious Arts I take their own Words before the Flood and knowing that he could bring no Book or Memorial of that nature into the holy Vessel where his Life was to be secured by the goodness of his Maker and wherein he was to remain with his righteous and godly Father caused the Rules and Precepts to  be graved in Metal and in hard Stone which should receive no Impression from the Water  But this is such an evident Fiction and full of so many Absurdities and Contradictions as well as Falshoods that 'tis not only unlikely it should but impossible it can be true  For  First  Where were those Plates left If they were to be preserved in the Ark 'tis certain  Noah  who had the Superintendency of the whole Building and of every thing that was brought into it or to be admitted would much less have admitted copper Plates to be brought in there or Tables of Stone with such Abominations engraven on them than he would have taken in written Books if such had been then in use  Secondly  Had  Cham  been such a Person so far engaged in a Correspondence with Hell we may reasonably suppose God who for the Reasons taken from the Sins of the rest of Mankind destroyed the whole World would never have spared him and so by him laid the Foundation of the  Devil  's second Kingdom and of his debauching the World with Sorcery and Witchcraft nor do we read that  Cham  or  Ham  was cursed by his Father on any such Account but for Sins actually committed after the Deluge and after their coming out of the Ark but to charge  Ham  with Sorcery and Diabolical Practices before the Flood is a gross begging the Question and by no means to be admitted without good Evidence  And again the Writing and Graving upon hard Stones Metal  c  requires a Proof that there was any such thing as the Knowledge and Use of Letters among Men before the Flood which after the strictest Enquiry is not yet ascertained much less agreed upon by Men of Learning the same having not been preserved to Mankind after the Deluge which 'tis highly probable would have  been if such a thing had been in use the Knowledge having been both innocent and useful  Thirdly  If such Writing or Engravement were made by  Cham  or any one else where were they laid and how found again when by the universal Convulsions suffer'd during the Flood not the least Vestiges Ruins or Remains of Cities or Towns were to be seen upon the Surface of the Earth but all was huddled together in the general Confusion of the Parts and either buried and overwhelmed in the Body of the Earth or driven down by the rapid Currents which followed at the going off of the Flood and it seems strange that these Stones or Plates could be found when every thing else was lost and overthrown when the Surface being perfectly new no one Part of the World could be known from another much less any Place be known by the Situation which it had before  There are many more Absurdities in the Case as it is proposed but I must not dwell too long in a Place that have so long a Journey to go  Zoroaster  is the next to whom they would ascribe the Magick Art but I have proved him to be a very honest Man and a wise Man properly speaking in my former Chapters and that he was employed in a much better and honester Study such as in discovering the Nature of Herbs and Plants Metals and Minerals precious Stones and Jewels that he invented the Doctrines and first Principles of natural and moral Philosophy and many useful and beneficial Parts of Knowledge for the Good of Mankind the Power of Simpathies and Antipathies and their various Workings and Objects in all which I take  Abraham  also who was still before him to have been especially famous and that 'tis probable  Abraham  was particularly instructed by  Noah  himself for 'tis evident  that  Abraham  was upwards of fifty Years old when  Noah  died  To come off of all this there are others who make another  Zoroaster  a real and Diabolical Magician who was not slain by  Semiramis  as that wise Prince  Zoroaster  was but on the other hand having been teaching his Disciples the Art of raising and conversing with Spirits was by one of them taken away out of his School all his Scholars looking on or if you will have it in a modern Style he raised the  Devil  to shew his Disciples a Test of his Art and the  Devil  carried him away in the face of them all to give them a Test of his Power which by the way was but poor Encouragement at that time for any one of them to turn Magician and for that Reason and knowing the  Devil  to be no Fool makes me give the less heed to that Part of the Story  Other Writers of whom  Josephus  is one whose Credit I must always premise goes but a very little way with me tells us that  Seth  the Son of  Adam  first discover'd the Planets or wandering Stars with their Motions Influences Revolutions  c  that those with several other useful Branches of Astronomic Knowledge were handed down by Tradition to  Noah  and by him to the new World and that then coming from  Noah  immediately to  Abraham  to  Zoroaster  and others they were handed from them to Posterity as we find it at this Day  But all this is nothing to the purpose that is to say nothing to our Diabolick Magick nor does it give any Light into the grand Question Who was the first Author of that kind of Study who was  Satan  's first Correspondent in the new World or first dealt with the  Devil  after the Flood I cannot think indeed that the  Devil  suffered Mankind to live long unmolested by him or that Mankind  could go on long without some Business between them they would be both eager to renew the Acquaintance and restore the ancient Familiarity and it could not be long before they found some means or other to bring it to pass for Lovers you know will meet whatever are the Difficulties which first obstruct and especially the great Artist on his Side had many dark Designs in view and new Foundations to lay for the Overthrow of a rising Generation which required to be laid deep and strong and the sooner they were begun the better for him  As to  Cham  being the Author of Magick in the new World that indeed I cannot grant that is to say not as the Ancients bring in the Story namely that he invented the Seven liberal Sciences and wrote them in fourteen Pillars of Brass or Stone  c  as above that  Cham  as he was notwithstanding the Curse he incurred by his ill Behaviour to his Father one of the immediate Progenitors of the new Race and particularly of those great and mighty Nations the  Aegyptians Arabians Africans  and  Phoenicians  among whom all human Wisdom and Learning first flourished and indeed first began so I doubt not but he was capable to instruct them in much of the antediluvean Knowledge and that of even the best things and did so That he reigned afterward in  Aegypt  a very long while is confirmed by all the antient Writers particularly in the Catalogue of the  Aegyptian  Kings of which  Cham  was certainly the first they are said to reign and succeed one another thus  Cham  peopled  Egypt  the Year of the World Years after the Flood  Osyris  or  Mizraim  the Son of  Cham  Years after the Flood  NB  This was the King who elevated  Joseph  and who built the Pyramids not for Tombs  and Monuments only but for Magick that is Astronomick Observations as  Semiramis  did the great Tower of  Babylon    From hence it appears that  Cham  came to  Aegypt  when he was near three hundred Years old suppose him to be an hundred Years old when he came out of the Ark which was the most for his elder Brother  Sem  was no more and that he reign'd in  Aegypt  one hundred and sixty one Years in which time he made the  Aegyptians  and the  Arabians  and also the  Phoenicians  for they were all his Offspring very polite Nations  The  Arabians  were his Posterity by his Son  Chus  The  Phoenicians  by his Son  Canaan  whom  Noah  cursed The  Aegyptians  by his Son  Mizraim  which was the King  Osyris  above The  Libyans  and  Aethiopians  by his Sons  Phut  and  Lud    So that in short  Cham  was so exceeding fruitful that he peopled all  Africa  and since that from  Africa  all  America  and those particularly populous Parts of  Asia  called  Arabia  and  Syria    I expect my lightheaded Readers whose Wits are too volatile for this remote Story will call this a dry Subject tho' to me I confess 'tis just the contrary but as it is too grave for them I will endeavour it shall not be too long for them so to oblige Folly and I am sure to the Dislike of the truly wise and solid Heads I leave off before I have done that I may not abate that most fashionable Custom of writing most of that which is pleasant and least of that which is profitable so willing is your humble Servant to be a Man of Mode and such a Weight does he put on those who have really no Weight in themselves  In favour then of the Usage of the Times and especially of the Genius and Temper I mention  above I am to leave off those grave tho' useful Digressions and come back to the Progress of Magick the particular Subject before me  That the  Devil  was the Aggressor in his new Correspondence with Mankind is not to be doubted but that is not so much our Business as to know when this Correspondence began who was the first among Men that carried on the clandestine Dealing and how it was managed on both Sides  We have cleared  Cham  of the Charge as far as Probabilities will go in his Favour and the Truth is  Cham  grew quickly too great was above the Occasion for it and being the first and perhaps the greatest Monarch upon Earth even before  Ninus  or  Bell    Baal  he had no need of turning Conjurer and Magician which became presently the Work of a meaner Race of Men than  Cham  for the Magicians especially speaking of them now as Witches and Inchanters were not Kings and Emperors but the Servants of Kings and Emperors kept and maintained for the wicked Works and Services which they did for them  Indeed the Magicians which I mentioned at first were Worshippers of the divine Being or eminent Examples of the Homage Men owed to the true God nay and even after some time were Teachers of divine things too tho' under the mistaken  Mediums  of Idols and Images These  Magi  or Magicians as I have observed were at first so reverenced and honoured by the Nations they served as often to be made Governours of the Commonwealth Publick Benefactors having the most Right to the publick Honours and Advancements in those Countries where they had been accepted for their Merits  Hence it seems most natural that all Kings should be Patriots seeing the very Name and Dignity much more the Office began in the Thing  but that by the way how far the  Patriot  and the  Royalty  go together in these Days how the Name and the Dignity correspond let the Kings of the Earth examine whose Business it is to mend it where it is not so and to let it be more known where it is  It is then pretty hard to find out who were the first Magicians taking the Word Magick as I now understand it  viz  in the worst Sense and yet it does not seem to be very long after the Flood before we shall find some of them at work for in the immediate Reign after  Cham  that is in the Reign of  Mizraim  or  Osyris  which History makes to be the  Pharaoh  whose Dream  Joseph  interpreted and who reigned two hundred sixty one Years in his Reign 'tis evident there were such People See the Place  Gen  xli  He sent and called for all the Magicians of  Aegypt  and all the wise Men thereof    It is true it does not appear positively that these were Magicians of the worst Sort but it seems to be so because Heaven reserved from them the revealing to  Pharaoh  the Interpretation of his Dreams which however might be to preserve the Honour to  Joseph  and to make way for all the great Events which followed but still I say we do not know that here were none of the present kind of wicked Magicians and we have much reason to believe there were  But within the Space of about two hundred Years after we are sure to find them nay the Text is plain they were there when  Moses  and  Aaron  stood before the last  Pharaoh  who held the People in Captivity for then they imitated the Miracles of  Moses  and  Aaron  by their Inchantments that is by  Sorcery  and  Witchcraft  now even this was but a little above eight hundred Years from the Flood and thus much may suffice for the Chronology of of Witchcraft and Sorcery  Being thus come to a tolerable Certainty as to Time when this Art was first practised we shall be led more directly to the Persons by entring a little into an Enquiry after the Practice that is the Manner made use of in those early Times of the Art for by discovering what they did we shall discover also who did it They acted certainly from the Beginning by certain Mystick or concealed Conjurations such as uncouth Noises and Sounds strange Gestures Postures and barbarous Magick Noises of which we shall say more in their Place  But what say our Enquirers were those things called Inchantments which constitute what is called the  Black Art  or the  Craft Magical  The Text says the Magicians did so and so by their  Inchantments  that is whatever Wonders or Miracles the two Prophets of God wrought by the Finger and Power of God these Men imitated by the Power of the  Devil    Those Inchantments I take to consist of certain agreed Gestures and Noises certain barbarous Names and Words and such inexplicable Terms of hellish Art which upon Concert between Hell and the hellish Agent are to be so and so understood between them on expressing of which and making such Circles and Figures on the Ground as is agreed the evil Spirit with whom they have concerted the Affair beforehand shall appear and appear too in such and such Form as they appoint to bring him out in and this I give as a brief Definition of what they call Inchantment  And here not to preach upon the Point or to insist that even what is thus acted must be by the Power of Heaven concurring for this is what all that are not Atheists acknowledge but I say not to dwell on this Part I make so free with our FellowConjurers as to say they put a great deal of Cheat upon the World in pretending to act by  supernatural Powers in those Inchantments let them be of what sort they will whereas they really acted much by Cheat and Trick Lege  demain or Slight of Hand and pretended the Prince of the Air when he had nothing to do in it that however some of those things were certainly by his the  Devil  's Aid and Assistance as it was with  Ali Albrahazen  and has been with others to this Day which we shall not and cannot deny yet 'ti  apparent much of it has been as I said meer juggling and deceiving  As the  Devil  has not tied himself up to Methods in his acting with Mankind so neither hav  the Magicians of the World kept to any certain Methods as to a stated Rule in their Actings among us but have on many Occasions made use of differing Methods I mean as to their Management between the  Devil  and them and also as to their apparent putting the Belief of it upon us  How we shall do to know and distinguish when the Magician puts the  Devil  upon us and when he only acts the Juggler would be worth while to find out and did either the  Devil  or the Magician act by any stated Rules and Methods we might make some Judgment about it but on the other hand they are so much and so often both  Devils  and both Jugglers that 'tis very difficult to fix them  For Example in their coming to Audience obtaining Admittance or call it what you will the great Question is How do they let the  Devil  know they want to speak with him either he is always at their Elbow and can hear them whenever they call whereever they are and on whatever Occasion and that would be to ascribe either great things to him as a Person or a great Number to him as an Host  Be that as it will 'tis certain these People have certain concerted Terms agreed as I said above upon repeating which he is to appear to them and  act for them as they shall agree and those I call Inchantments There are also other agreed Signals upon making which the  Devil  according to the Terms agreed on between them shall act in such and such a manner without appearing and those I call Charms  Thus it seems the  Devil  and Dr  B  reman  agreed the Matter the good Doctor having a mind to pay home an old Jest upon a young Gentleman that had abused a poor Girl a  lient of his the Doctor it seems told her that if she could perswade him to get into her Smock upon their n  x  Intimacy he would certainly agree to marry her upon which the poor Girl makes herself a new one and very large for the Purpose and getting the young Fellow into it the Doctor as was said laid such a Charm upon it or the  Devil  by his Order that the Fellow could never get out of it till he gave the Girl a Note under his Hand to marry her the next Morning and accordingly did it  If the Story be Fact as is loudly affirm'd the  Devil  acted upon the honest side it seems which I do not however charge upon him as a thing that he is often guilty of but now and then for the Credit of his Employers he may be allowed to go out of his Way a little  What those things called Charms are and how made use of may occasion some Speculation as we go on and when we come to speak of Charms as they are used between the  Magicians  and the People but I am now upon the Subject of Charms and Inchantments as they relate to the proper Intercourse between the Magician and the  Devil  or the Spirit whom he acts with or by or for whom he acts for 'tis not easy to express it right  I say 'tis not easy to say in what Capacity the Magician is to be understood to act Whether WITH that is in Concert and Agreement or as we might say in Partnership with the  Devil  or whether  in a superior Orb as a Magician of Quality making use of an attendant obsequious commanded  Devil  always at his call to do what he bids him jump over his Stick run and go fetch and carry like a Dog as some eminent Magicians of State have been said to act or as St  Dunstan  St  Francis  the Abbot of  Crowland  and others did by him who they tell us set him to work sent him of Errands made him ring the Bell to Vespers sweep the Church and a thousand good things the serviceable  Devil  did for them if his good Humour is not bely'd by the Priests knavery and Satan charg'd with more Complaisance for 'em than ever he was guilty of Or Whether the  Devil  is Master which I must own is more likely and the Magician Servant and then he does not act the  Devil  but the  Devil  acts him and makes him do every thing he bids him I say all these are doubtful Points and not yet fully understood by us or at least not easily  But be it which of these it will there must be some concerted Terms of  come  and  call  between the  Devil  and his Correspondents like Ships at Sea they must converse by Signals they must know when to meet and when to summons for a meeting when to appear and when to disappear and to do this is one of the constituting Parts of Magick for without it the Magician is as good as no body and the Devil in short would appear of no use to him  In some Parts of  India  they alledge to this Day that he is talk'd with in the apparent Shape of a Man and in the Habit of their Priests but that is not the Business they add that whenever they want to speak with him they go up to such and such Mountains in Troops or Assemblies such as ours at  NewHall  perhaps only with some specifick Differences which I might mention but that they are too  trifling to trouble you with When they are all together they call him with a little KettleDrum just as I told you the good old Wives hive their Bees save that they beat it on the wrong side then they pronounce some Words which they call Charms and the  Devil  comes without fail  It is hard to find out in History what Words those were that were us'd for Charms in  Aegypt  and  Arabia  between the  Devil  and the Magicians for so many Ages it is certain they differ'd in differing Countries and 'tis as certain they differ'd as the several Persons acted together or apart but I am as much at a loss to find out what the  Devil  should mean by suffering those Words or any Words at all to charm call awaken or alarm him as I am to know what the Words were but at present let us think of the Words  The  Greeks  have left us a Word which was us'd by the  Magicians  of Antiquity among them upon these and many more such Occasions This is that famous Trine or Triangular Word call'd  Abracadabra  which drawn out in its Equilateral Sides stands thus  ABRACADABRA  There is abundance of learned Puzzle among the Ancients to find out the Signification of this Word the subtle Position of the Letters gave a  ind of Reverence to them because they read it  s it were every way upwards and downwards  ackwards and forwards and many will have it still  hat the  Devil  put them together Nay they be  an at last to think it was old  Legion  's Sirname and whenever he was call'd by that Name he used to come very readily for which reason the old Women in their Chimneycorners would be horribly  fraid of saying it often over together for if they should say it a certain number of times they had a Notion it would certainly raise the  Devil    They say on the contrary that it was invented by one  Basilides  a learned  Greek  that it contain'd the great and awful Name of the Divinity and that it was used for many Years for the opposing the Spells and Charms of the Pagans that is the Diabolical Spells and Charms of the Pagan  Magicians    But be this as it will it fell into Contempt in afterAges and was used by the  Magicians  themselves so that its containing or being intended to contain the Name of  God  seems to me to be a Pretence only to add a kind of Veneration to the Word whereas it it now drop'd only that some of our old Women and quack  Magicians  use it for a Spell or Charm as they would have it call'd to cure Agues being written on a piece of Parchment and hang'd about the Neck of the afflicted Person  It would be nothing but crowding our Work with old Stories to collect together what they call Spells and Charms which our People here make use of whereever they had them to cure Distempers I know an old Bookridden  Bunyanist  that is to say a  Baptist Preacher  in  Bedfordshire  who cur'd Agues by only saying some Words while he gave the Patient a piece of Paper to put into his Pocket others I have known cur'd by saying  some Words only and giving them nothing at all I could give you many Examples and you will find many more in the learned Collections of Mr  Aubery  and others where in particular there is the Question answer'd Why saying some Words which have no Signification and which neither the Person to whom they are said or the Person himself who says them can understand should work a Cure and the Answer is because the Gods understood what the Person meant who first implor'd their Aid in those Words and to which they have still regard  This shews a little what I am bringing all these things to namely that this was the Remains of the old Pagan Magick and is all deriv'd from it tho' perhaps it is practis'd with less criminal Correspondence than it was then the People that now do these things not knowing what they say or to whom they say it yet certainly the thing is the same  And this too gives us a light into the ancint Practices of the  Magicians  in  Arabia  and  Aegypt  and the Nature of those things which the Scripture call  Inchantments and how and to what uses those Inchantments were obtain'd and apply'd take The whole in this summary Account which I gather from the exactest Observation of the usage of those Times and of the behaviour of the People in the following Ages  Of the Nature and Original of Inchantments  The Story of the  Devil  and  Ali Albrahazen  the  Sabean  or  Persian  stands as a good Foundation we have another without a Name an  Aegyptian  I will not add a Name by way of Invention because I will not  put my Sanction to the Truth of all the Particulars  ut the Story is of the same Use whether one Word of the Fact be true or no And so tho' I might take up some time with Vouchers for the Relation I leave it upon your Hands as a current Tradition for those things are too ancient for Quotation of any sort  NB  There is no room to question but that in  Arabia Aegypt Syria  and those Countries where so much Magick was at first practis'd and where the  Devil  's Correspondence with Mankind was begun where Magick was in its Perfection for so many Ages and practis'd with such apparent Success there are a great many strange Stories current to this Day and the Mouths of the People are still fill'd with Traditional Accounts of the Wonders of the Ancients their strange Perfomances and the Effects of their Magical Skill the People are full of them and even our  Europeans  when they travel into those Countries bring away innumerable Tales of this kind which lose little in the coming as perhaps this among the rest  The Account I am now going to give relates to a  Magician  of great Note it seems tho' as I have said I have not his Name whom the  Devil  if it was the  Devil  managed much in the same way as the other and 'tis of like use in the Case before us For as it confirms the  Devil  's Conduct to be much the same with Mankind tho' in different Places so it shews us that the same occasions suit him to make use of Before he frighted the  Sabeans  with a Meteor or Ball of Fire in the Air Now he alarms  Aegypt  with a Comet either of them things of no Signification in themselves and which we in those days can look on without running to Conjurers for their Interpretation But in those younger  days they were surprising and terrifying and therefore very proper to amuse the World with and to make even Kings as well as People send for their  Magicians  to enquire after the Events of them  In like manner we find in both these Accounts the  Devil  not only making use of Dreams for disturbing the Fancies of the People as well their Kings as others but we find him in both using that Power peculiar to him as a Spirit namely of causing People to Dream of this or that whatever he pleases on purpose to furnish a Counterfeit Interpretation to his Favourite Southsayer and raise his Reputation at Court in order to serve his  Satan  's Interest in other subsequent Delusions But I refer to the Story  An  Arabian  of Ancient Fame and Eminent in the  Aegyptian  Court for his great Skill in Southsaying having long studied the Knowledge of hidden and secret things and arriv'd to great Skill in the Motions and Revolutions of the Stars and Planets had made himself famous on that Account Having also much studied the Appearances and Nature of the Planets Vapours Meteors and other the  Phaenomena  of the upper Regions from whence he made great and accurate Improvements in Natural and Experimental Philosophy he also studied and understood the nature of Plants Flowers Drugs Gums  c  and the Influences of the Heavenly Bodies upon them giving them Virtue Colour Aromatick Flavour and most healing and comforting Powers and by this Knowledge our Learned  Arabian  obtain'd the Fame of a most excellent Physician as well as of a wise Man and Southsayer and was had in universal Esteem but especially I say in the Court of  Pharaoh  King of  Aegypt    NB  They do not tell us which  Pharaoh  this was so that the Chronology of this  Arabian  is something defective in that Part but neither is this very material because much of it will be discover'd by the other Circumstances  Unwearied in his Diligence and Studies and eaten up with the Desire of Knowledge this  Arabian  Doctor for such we shall now call him not at all abating his Search after Wisdom by the Fame already obtain'd but seeing daily that there was an Abyss of Knowledge yet behind and that all he knew was as nothing compar'd to what he was still ignorant of he pursued his Search into Nature with the utmost Application All Night yea many Nights together he continued upon the Hills and in the Desarts whither he wandered for  Aegypt  is a plain Country for many Leagues together from  Memphis  where he resided I say all Night he spent in looking up into Heaven and all Day in poring upon the Earth searching into the Secrets of Nature and trying and proving the Virtues of the Plants and Fruits and other Rarities the Product of that rich and fertile Soil And thus he wasted and exhausted his vital and animal Strength to feed and nourish the Strength of his Mind and fill his Head and Heart with Divine Wisdom and Understanding Thus far it must be acknowleg'd he was a true Original Magician and a Man of Merit as well as Fame  It happened in his wandering through the Desart to the Station where he usually fix'd his Place of Astronomick Observations that he saw rise up out of the Sea Northward from his Situation a Body of Fire which at first seem'd to him one plain Flame making an oblong Square of an immense Length and Breadth But as it ascended with the ordinary Motion of the Heavens  or rather according  to the new Systems  the ordinary Motion of the Earth it lessen'd in its apparent Dimensions and also came to bear a more regular Form than before till coming to its full Height it appear'd after some time to be a  Comet  or  Blazingstar  which was visible above the Horizon as is usual in such Bodies for about twenty six Days or Nights rather successively and then was seen no more  This Appearance being entirely new surmounted all the powers of his Understanding and extremely perplex'd him and being one Night more than ordinarily afflicted about it he broke out into Words to this purpose tho' not directed to any of the Gods not knowing it seems which of them were able to inform him and which not  O that some of the blessed Inhabitants of the  UNSEEN WORLD  would assist me in searching out the Mystery of this strange Phaenomenon    He was the more anxious about it because at his return to his own House at  Memphis  he had an Account that  Pharaoh  had summon'd all the Magicians and wise Men of  Aegypt  to give him their several Opinions of the meaning of this strange Appearance for the King had either seen it or heard of it from others The Appearance of it as I have said being constant for about twenty six days after the  Arabian  had first discover'd it and the wise Men differing very much in their Accounts of it their Judgment had encreas'd the King's Curiosity very much besides the  Arabian  Southsayer had notice given him that he would receive a Summons or Order to come to the King's Palace upon the same Occasion  Being thus as is said extremely puzzled with this Affair and believing perhaps that he should do no more when he came to the King than discover his Ignorance as the rest of the Southsayers and the Magicians had done he was very uneasy  and resolv'd to retire into  Aethiopia  for some time till the Enquiry might be over and as he was not sent for to the King when the rest of the Magicicians were it would be no Impeachment of his Fame that he was gone abroad for some time  One Day while this publick Uneasiness lasted as he was walking towards his usual Observatory as above there joyn'd him a grave and venerable old Man who saluting him with the usual Blessing of the Times and in the  Arabick  Tongue falls into Discourse with him upon divers Subjects such as seem'd to shew that the  Stranger  was like himself an Enquirer after Knowledge Among the rest of their Discourse the  Arabian  particularly gave the Stranger an Account of the late Appearance which he had seen as above  They walk'd together till they came to the Foot of a gently rising Mount on the Top of which the  Arabian  had erected for himself a little Hut or Bower of Palmtree Leaves here the Stranger seeing him ready to go up to the Hill offer'd to take his Leave but he entreated him to go up to his Observatory as he call'd it with him and to stay with him that Night that he might shew him the said Appearance and that in the Morning he should go whither he pleas'd  When they were come up to the Ascent of the Hill the Day being shut in and the time for Observation of the Stars come on the Heavens being clear and the Moon absent under the Horizon leaving them a fair View of the Stars perfectly bright and clear the Stranger ask'd him in what part of the Hemisphere he had seen the Comet rise and set and what was the particular Sphere of its Motion all which he shew'd him most exactly and at last the Comet it self not forgetting at the same time to let the Stranger know how anxious and concern'd he had been to understand the Nature  and Reason as well as the Import of the Appearance of such a Body and to what particular Nation it had a Reference and at last told him how vehemently he had call'd out to the Gods to give him some wise Interpreter to instruct him in the Nature of such Appearances and of that in particular  The Stranger took no notice of his knowing that he had done so but began with a Philosophical Discourse of Comets as of Stars which in their ordinary Revolutions are but seldom visible and therefore when they do appear says he it is generally supposed that they import great Changes and Troubles among Men which says he may in one Sense be true because they frequently are very much the occasion of them  But says the  Arabian  how shall we know when they have Important Significations and when not and to what Nations and Countries their Significations are directed and which are not concern'd in them  Says the Stranger There are Methods to know these things also and the Gods when they are minded to communicate these things do it their own way But  Father  says the  Arabian  if you can relieve my Thought in the Signification of the present Difficulty pray be so kind for I acknowledge my Ignorance and that which perplexes me the more about it is that I expect to be call'd before  Pharaoh  tomorrow whom I reverence in the highest manner I beseech you inform me what I am to call this strange new Appearance and what are its Consequences to the World  Here the Stranger looking upon him with a smiling Aspect reply'd I have great Regard for your being esteem'd by  Pharaoh  and shall let you into the Knowledge of what you desire for your farther good Fortune Know then added he with an  Aspect all shining and pleasant  'The Appearance we now see is a Comet or Blazingstar the like of which has not been seen in  Aegypt  in the Memory of the most ancient Man in the Kingdom which makes the wise Men entirely at a loss about it neither have they receiv'd any traditional Account of such a  Phaenomena  from their Fathers  'Comets continued he are not as fix'd Stars Bodies of Fire burning in the same manner as the Sun but Bodies of a different Nature compos'd either of prepar'd created Matter suited from the beginning for Inflamation or of vast Collections of exhal'd and condens'd Matter subject to Inflamation and more or less inflam'd according to the Position of their Orbits and Motion and therefore the Eruption of their Flame is but on one side or on one side chiefly as we see this burning with a continued and vehement Eruption They move in the utmost Extent of the Waste or Expance of Space which you call the  Aether  or Air and their Distance is so great and their Revolutions so tedious that they sometimes do not come so near this Globe as to be visible no not in five hundred or a thousand Years and this is the second that was ever seen in this Hemisphere since the great Deluge of the Earth in the Years of  Pharaoh  's Great Grandfather's Father being now above eight hundred Years past  'The long Tail or extended Flame which you see at one side of the Star is the Eruption of Flame which as I say continually burns with great Violence and is sometimes extended to an immense and unmeasurable Length even to that of many hundred thousand Millions of  Stadia  and blazes out for ever  The  Arabian  heard this with a surprise of Pleasure and was even ready to kneel down and worship him which you will say 'tis much the  Devil  should refuse But when he was just going to enquire of him what Import this Appearance was to the World and to  Aegypt  more especially and above all to the King in particular he was not only disappointed to the last degree but most miserably afflicted and surpris'd for that turning his Head casually from him or rather his Head being turn'd or his Eyes turn'd from him he in that very Moment disappeared and was gone  It was in vain that the  Arabian  Doctor ran out of the Hut or Bower and down the Hill after him to his two Servants who always attended him at the Foot of the Hill enquiring of them if the Father the venerable Stranger came not to them they constantly and faithfully affirm'd that they had watch'd as was their Duty against wild Beasts for his Security and that nothing had passed by them  It was in vain also that he went back lamenting and calling aloud upon the Stranger whom he styl'd  Father  to return  How is it  said he  that you could thus far illuminate my Understanding and reveal the secret of Wisdom  but in part  promising to me a clear and perfect Knowledge  and then leave me  uninstructed and in the dark in the main and grand Inquiry  But no Voice no Appearance return'd which afflicted him sore and the Day appearing he resolv'd to continue there the next Night in hopes he might see him again in the Evening as he had done before After resolving on this and having been waking as is said all Night he laid him down to sleep He was no sooner fallen into a deep Sleep but he dream'd that he saw or to speak it in the Language of the East the ancient Father the venerable Stranger appear'd to him again in a  Dream    He was most agreeably surpriz'd with the Sight of him and according to the Eastern Custom fell at his Feet embracing his Knees and with all the  passionate Expressions which he had used before expostulated with him that he should leave him so in the dark and half inform'd after having assur'd him that he would fully let him into the Knowledge of that most important Secret  The Vision on the contrary seem'd displeas'd and look'd at him with a less smiling and pleasant Countenance than he had done before when he was awake and with a stern Voice ask'd him wherefore he call'd after him so importunately when he had staid so long with him and had so fully inform'd him of all things he could desire  O my  Father  says the  Arabian  tho' himself a hundred and fifty Years old did not you put me in Expectation that you would likewise inform me of what mighty Importance this frightful Comet should be to  Pharaoh  and to his Kingdom and to the Country where we are that I might obtain the Favour of the King and be accepted for my extraodinary Wisdom and Knowledge among the People  '  Thou Fool  says the Vision harshly O thou of  weak  and  empty  Judgment was it not sufficient to thee that I had let thee know it was no new thing nothing out of the Course of Nature but a Comet or Star of a different kind from and remoter Position than the rest that it came to be visible here only in the Course of its ordinary Revolution and may perhaps appear just in the same Manner and in the same Place again about seven or eight hundred Years hence  'Can any thing be more natural than that when I had told thee this thou should'st know also that there are no extraordinary things portended in Nature's common and ordinary Events no Portentous Threatning no ill Omens or Bodings in the common Appearances of the Heavens no more in one Star than in another When I had therefore told thee that it was only an ordinary  Revolution of a Comet I in effect told thee that it imported nothing either to  Pharaoh  or to thee or to any Person or Place whatever  The  Arabian  surpris'd and yet inform'd by this Discourse stood justly reprov'd and for a while answer'd not a Word which the Vision as it were observing spoke again as follows  'Tho' I have given thee sufficient Light whereby to expose the Ignorance of the wise Men who have been call'd before  Pharaoh  yet there are many things which thou mayst say to the King which are of great Importance to him and his Kingdom to know which thou shalt be enabled by me to give him the Knowledge of and which if thou diligently listen to my Instructions shall set thee at the right Hand of the King in all his Councils and cause thee to be esteem'd the wisest Man in his Kingdom But then thou must be very careful to observe all the Rules which I shall give thee and to act in exact Obedience to them  The Doctor awaking and the Vision being ended he now began to understand who it was he had been conversing with namely an Angel of the invisible World I suppose the Word  Devil  was not known among them at that time and that for the future he had a fair Opportunity of good Intelligence from the other World upon all necessary Occasions and upon the most important Enquiries  Comforted exceedingly with this Intelligence he hastens back to the City and being sent for to appear before the King as he expected  Pharaoh  told him the Occasion of his sending for him and how the Southsayers and wise Men were puzzl'd and perplex'd about it but could give him no Rational Account of it  Upon this the  Arabian  told the King that he was sorry to find him  Pharaoh  made so uneasy by the Apprehensions of a thing which tho' above the Reach and Understanding of the Magicians had yet in it nothing Extraordinary nothing out of the Course of Nature that there was nothing in it more than the necessity of its own Motion occasion'd and that it had therefore no portentous Import or Signification to  Pharaoh  or to any of his People or of his Dominions and that this he might be assur'd of  Then he went on and gave the King an Account of the Nature of the thing as a  Comet  or  Blazingstar  and that Word for Word as the ancient Stranger  or Spirit  had deliver'd it and this he did too in the Audience not of  Pharaoh  only but of his whole Court and that with such a general Applause that all the other Magicians and Southsayers acknowledged the Justice and Reason of what he said and the King was made perfectly easy upon that Account From whence they tell us that the  Aegyptians  tho' in other Cases the most superstitious People in the World and that used formerly to be the most concern'd upon all new  Phaenomena  in the Heavens or upon any unusual Appearances flying immediately to the Divinations and to their Southsayers and Magicians to interpret and account for such things to them are yet ever since this Discovery by the  Arabian  Southsayer so long ago under no Concern at all upon the Appearance of  Comets  or  Blazingstars  on any Account whatsoever  But I return to the  Arabian  It was no small Fame which he gain'd by the Solution he had given of this Appearance of a  Comet Pharaoh  preferr'd him before all the  Magicians  of  Aegypt  and exalted him to divers Honours but particularly to that of being near his Person to counsel and advise  him upon all extraordinary Occasions as well in Matters of State and Politicks as Matters of Difficulty Nor did the rest of the Magicians envy him the Honours he enjoy'd for they were convinc'd he merited all the King had done for him and which was more they did not find they could come at any Part of the extraordinary Intelligence or Understanding in things which he was Master of  In the mean time as he was too wise to communicate to any body the source of his Information so he was too well satisfied with his new Intelligence to neglect the Part he was directed to act which was frequently to meet with the Vision which had once been so favourable to him In a word he follow'd with the greatest Assiduity the begun Intimacy and sail'd not to attend the very next Night in particular after he had made his Speech concerning the Comet before the King  On that occasion going towards his Observatory as usual he was encounter'd by a Man in the Habit of an  Aethiopian  riding upon a Mule and having a Bow hanging over his Shoulder a Sheaf of Arrows at his Side and a Lance in his Hand the Man seem'd to shun him and offer'd to go forward but presently turn'd back and with a kind of Compliment to the  Arabian  Doctor enquir'd of him if there were any way for him to Foord through the River  Nilus  which at that time of the Year was so low as to be in some Places almost dry and easily passable on Horseback The  Arabian  courteously answer'd him that there was not any Place near the Road or Track which he was going in and that he being as he perceiv'd a Stranger and alone it would be hazardous for him to venture but that if he would be pleas'd to stay and go with him to a little Hut which he had hard by for his Retreat in the Night he would guide him in the Morning  to a Place where he should pass the River with Safety  The Traveller thank'd him for the kind Offer but seem'd rather inclin'd to go on Sir says the  Arabian  the Night approaches and you may meet with other Dangers in the way from Crocodiles Lions  c  pressing him again to stay but he declin'd it again and as to the Dangers he laugh'd at and despis'd them Well then says the kind hospitable  Arabian  let me send one of my Servants with you to guide you He seem'd at first inclin'd to accept so kind an Offer as that was but falling a little farther into Discourse the  Arabian  perceiv'd the Stranger began to look pleas'd and fancying he would accept the first Offer  viz  of staying all Night mov'd it again and with a little additional entreating the Stranger consented to that Part and turn'd back with them  The  Arabian  tho' with two Servants with him was always on foot he had himself no Weapons being without fear but of wild Beasts against which his two Servants were his Security who were armed with Swords and Lances but the Stranger well arm'd as above turning back they went on fearless together towards the Hill which was about the Distance of two Miles  In the Way the  Arabian  was a little shock'd with the unusual Civility which a great overgrown Crocodile shew'd them who rushing out of a marshy kind of Bog near the Way came forward towards them but on a sudden turn'd back and very obsequiously crept into the lurking Place where it had just before come out from and lay still there as quiet as if it had been hush'd by its own Fears as perhaps it was  At a small Distance farther they met two She Lions or as some call them Lionesses and as they heard them growling at some Distance before they  were seen they that is the  Arabian  and his two Servants began to show some Concern about it but behold when the Lions appeared they immediately turned about and fled with the utmost Precipitation  After a little farther walking the  Arabian  turning to his Guest told him There pointing to the Hill which was close at hand was his little Retreat to which he had invited him and desired him to leave his Mule with his Servants and to walk up the little Mount with him which the Traveller very readily did bidding his new Landlord go before to shew him the way and he would follow him as also he did but what a Surprise think you was the poor  Arabian  in between Joy and Fright when turning about at the Top of the Ascent to receive his Guest he saw nobody but the ancient venerable Stranger who had at first appeared to him and from whom he  ad received so much kind Instruction and Assistance before  The  Apparition  for such I suppose it should be now called perceiving him in some Confusion bid him not be surprised for he was still his Friend and in the same Disposition to serve him as before and asked him whether he came that Night in Expectation of meeting him or not to which the  Arabian  replyed He did hoping to see him in Person or in Vision having something to offer which he hoped he would be so kind as to comply with him in  Upon asking what it was he told him That  Pharaoh  had a great Difficulty upon him and had asked him his Opinion therein and he knew not what Answer to give  What is this Difficulty  says the Apparition    Why  says the Arabian  he has a private Account from his Spies that  Thermesbus  the General of the Armies of  Aethiopia  designs to invade him in the  Beginning of the Year with an infinite Number of Troops and as the King is in greater Readiness to begin the War than the other he wants my Opinion whether he shall make War upon  Aethiopia  forthwith or stay till he is obliged to do it in his own Defence  Go you back  says the Spectre to him  and wait till the King sends for you to interpret his Dream or Dreams  What Dream  says the Arabian    Why tomorrow Night  says the Spectre  the King shall dream that a black  Elephant  came up to the Gates of his Palace and that with his mighty Tusks or Teeth he broke down the Gates and was entring in to make farther Spoil when the Gates being  as I say  broken down first the Tower which was over the Gates being shaken with the Fall fell down soon after upon the Elephant and wellnigh crush'd him to death but that tho' by his great Strength he bore up the Weight yet he was so terrified with the Fall of the Tower upon him that he withdrew into the Desart and went quite away  And what Interpretation shall I give of this Dream  says the Arabian    You shall tell him  says the Spectre  That the black Elephant is the King of  Aethiopia  that he shall send his General to invade him even to the Gates of his Frontier City of  Zaba  and shall enter the Gates thereof but that the  Aegyptians  in Garrison within shall break out and fall upon him and tho' by the great Power of their Troops they shall escape yet that they shall retire and go back into the Desarts of  Aethiopia  and not dare to look upon him any more  But what then shall I advise to be done  says the Arabian    You will find it most rational  says the Spectre  to advise him to begin the War and may promise him Success without Fear but if not let him place very great Garrisons in all the Frontier Towns of his Dominions South and especially in  Zaba  or  Zabda  and let him wait in a good Posture of Defence till the  Aethiopian  Army advances to the Siege of that Place and so his Dream will come to pass  This was all wonderful the  Arab  was surprised with being thus furnished for ingratiating himself with his Master the King of  Aegypt  he knew well enough that to be able to make  Pharaoh  dream what he pleased and then to interpret it how he pleased must needs make him pass for a great Man in a Country too so superstitiously addicted to Dreams and so uneasie to have those Dreams interpreted as the People of  Aegypt  were  Thus furnished he goes back to the City where he heard nothing till the third Day in the Morning when the whole Court was in Disorder all Faces seem'd cloudy and every Mind disturbed The News was soon spread into all Parts of the City that the King had had a frightful and terrible Dream which had so distracted his Mind 'tis supposed they did not call him His Majesty that he could not rest  The wise Men and the Southsayers Magicians and Astrologers were immediately sent for in a great hurry to give their Opinion and interpret  Pharaoh  's Dream The Circumstances of the Dream were much the same with those already mentioned with this Addition that at the Beginning  Pharaoh  being in a deep Sleep heard as he thought a sudden great Noise that it alarm'd the whole City and that his Guards as we call them or Soldiers which were about him were awaken'd but all fled away and that the City was even left without Defence only that the Gates were shut  That in the midst of this Hurry a monstrous black Elephant breaking down all before him and even overthrowing the Houses and Buildings which were without the City came on no one resisting him to the Gates of the City or Castle where  Pharaoh  slept that with the Force of his mighty Tusks or Teeth he beat down the Gates thereof but that the Tower being shaken also Part of the Building fell down upon the Back of the Elephant and as the King thought at first had crushed him to Death  But that notwithstanding the Weight of the Building which fell down was very great yet that the Elephant by his mighty Strength bore it self up and received no Injury by it but being made afraid by the great Blow it received it withdrew and retired into the Desart towards the South  None of the Magicians could interpret this Dream or rather they could not agree in their Interpretations of it some said one thing some another so that  Pharaoh  received no Satisfaction from their Interpretations whereupon the  Arab  who appeared at Court purposely to be called in was summon'd the King being told that he was there  He came without any Hesitation at the first Call and the King with great Appearance of Disturbance tells him what a strange Dream he had had how it had disturbed him and the like and added that none of the Interpretations which the wise Men had given of it were satisfactory to him or agreeing with one another The  Arab  having then demanded a Particular of the King's Dream had it related to him as above then he desired to know what Account the Magicians had given of it and how they had interpreted it which when he was told he express'd some Wonder that they should all amuse the King in such a manner and should say nothing but what was perfectly remote from the Case  But turning to the King  'Let not  Pharaoh  says he be any more disturbed about the Interpretation of his Dream seeing the Event shall redound to the Honour of the King and Prosperity of his Dominions for that the Dream being interpreted is a Representation of what shall immediately come to pass'  and then he went on to interpret boldly the Dream thus  'The Noise O King says he which thou wast alarm'd with in the City and which thy Soldiers were intimidated with so as to run out of the City this is nothing else but a Rumour of War from the South and a certain Alarm upon the Approach of an Army upon the Borders at whose Approach all the Inhabitants of the Country shall fly into the Mountains and Cities for fear of the Invaders  'The black Elephant assaulting the Gates of the King's Palace is the General of the Armies of  Aethiopia  who shall make War upon  Pharaoh  and shall invade his Kingdoms with a great Army and shall break down the Gates of his strong Cities but let not the King be dismayed at the Strength of this Enemy which is so great for the Power of  Pharaoh  shall fall upon him and shall strike him with Terror and Amazement so that he shall flee away with all his Army into the Wilderness and into the Desart Country and shall be seen no more  He had no sooner delivered his Interpretation but  Pharaoh  embraced him with Joy and told him That he had indeed given him a right Interpretation of the Dream and that he fully believed it would come to pass in the same manner Whereupon  Pharaoh  forthwith caused Preparations of War to be made and sent Ambassadors into  Aethiopia  to denounce War  The same Year that the  Arabian  had given this Interpretation of the King's Dream the  Aethiopians  with a great Army invaded the Coasts of  Aegypt  wasting the Country and slaying the People even to the Gates of  Zaba  or  Zabda  a fortified City on the Frontiers of the Country which they besieged but in vain and the King of  Aegypt  marching against them with all his Chariots and Horses at their Approach the  Aethiopians  fled and retired into the Desart Country and were seen no more  This Story supposing it or the Substance of it to be true lets us into the Manner and Method in and by which the  Devil  first introduced a Correspondence with Mankind and how he transacted the same with the  Magicians  of  Aegypt  which was certainly continued by him for many Ages afterwards in the very same manner and by which the Magicians of  Aegypt  obtained so much in the Opinion of Mankind that they passed for the wisest Men in the World whereas all this Knowledge if we may believe Tradition was neither more or less than a meer dealing with the  Devil  a plain downright Hellish Correspondence managed by a magical Scheme dictated by the  Devil  himself and observed by the Magicians with but too much Exactness on all Occasions  By this Diabolical Magick the  Devil  conversed freely with the Magicians and they with him and whatever some may pretend that the  Devil  cannot assume a human Shape for his Correspondence with Mankind 'tis most certain that he did appear in divers Shapes and on many Occasions or else all the Accounts of such things which Tradition has handed down to the succeeding Ages must be false and fabulous made up by the Invention of the Ages in which they were written  But that this was not so is apparent from the Scripture as also from the first Writers of the  Aegyptian  and  Phoenician  Histories by all which we read of the Wickedness of the Magicians as particularly  in the Story of the Wonders wrought by  Aaron  and  Moses  in the Presence of  Pharaoh  where it is allowed that the Magicians wrought by Inchantment which I always understood to mean by Invoking the Assistance of the evil Spirit and by receiving Help and Secret Powers as well as Intelligence from those evil Spirits and besides the working by Inchantment or Sorcery so taken Notice of there we see it mentioned again in the Book of  Wisdom  Chap xvii speaking of the Plague of Darkness he says  They were scatter'd under a dark Veil of Forgetfulness being horribly astonished and troubled with strange Apparitions Noises as of Waters falling down sounded about them and sad Visions appeared unto them with heavy Countenances  Ver  Only there appeared to them a Fire kindled of it self very dreadful for being much terrified they thought the things which they saw more terrible than the Things they saw not  Ver  As for the Illusions of Art Magick they were put down and their vaunting in Wisdom was reproved with Disgrace For they that promised to drive away Terrors and Troubles from a sick Soul were sick themselves with Fear and worthy to be laughed at  This whole Quotation is a Description of the Darkness of  Aegypt  in which according to this Text there were strange Apparitions being evidently the  Devil  and evil Spirits with human Shapes horrible Appearances and heavy Countenances  I think this is so plain as to need no Confirmation from other Opinions Magick was reproved that is to say disgraced because the  Devil  could not assist the Magician so as to make any Abatement of the Darkness which was wrought by Heaven for even the Fire could not be made to give any Light so the Power of Art nay even of Magick it self was at an End  In this terrible Case the  Devil  or rather  Devils  were it seems permitted to appear in horrible and frightful Shapes with heavy Countenances  c  In like manner I cannot doubt but he appeared to the Magicians when he and they had Occasion to meet and converse and carry on their Hellish Combinations and Confederacies for doing Mischief and this brings me of course to speak of the Manner of the Magicians conversing with the  Devil  for hitherto we have only spoken of his conversing with them  The Case is this Whenever the  Devil  had an Occasion to speak with the old  Arab  or in Ages after that for the  Arab  was first with  Ali Albrahazen  the Magician of  Saba  in  Arabia  he knew well how to find them out and could go to them meet them in  Apparition  or speak to them in Vision But what was to be done when they wanted his Assistance upon any Emergency  The Story of  Ali  mentioned already stated the Matter for him namely that he was to go into the Desart to a certain Palmtree surround it so many times call the  Devil  so many times in every Circle by such and such a Name and then he would come  Here was indeed a great deal of Ceremony before his Worship would be spoken with and I cannot but think our Friend  Roger M  Accepted Free Mason  c  speaks with him sometimes upon much easier Terms for the World is grown much nicer of late than they were then and the  Devil  is obliged to treat with them on Terms of less Ceremony  But the rest of the Story of the old  Arabian  will state this Matter much clearer and to the Understanding of every Reader and will let us see a little what Methods they took to raise the  Devil  in King  Pharaoh  's time and before our modern Experiments were in use  The  Arab  was now a great Person all  Aegypt  received him as a wonderful Man his Words were the Oracle of the Day for whatever he said came to pass he was sent to far and wide and Messengers came from  Persia  from  Phoenicia  nay from  Aethiopia  for him to come thither and give the Interpretation of their Visions and explain to them every doubtful Case but he would not leave the Court of  Pharaoh  and he was in the right for the King highly honoured him  All this while his Reputation wholly depended upon the constant Intelligence which he kept up with his familiar Spirit so I may now call it I mean the Apparition which came to him in the Desart but as this Appearing was arbitrary and when it pleased and might not be at hand when he might have a more than ordinary Occasion for it it occurr'd to him one Night to propose Methods of a more constant and less difficult Correspondence and that the Apparition might be brought to a greater Familiarity so as that when any Exigence was upon him he might be sure of his Aid might be able to call him to his Assistance and that he would not sail to appear  Story does not record what Condition the  Devil  might make with the old  Arab  as for selling Souls signing Contracts  and the like  it seems to me there was little need of these things in those Days if there had and the  Devil  had insisted on it I doubt not the  Arabian  would have made no more Scruple of it than our Brother of the Trowel who adorns so often his blue Ribband with the most honourable Badge of the Leather Apron and being first incorporated as above in the ancient Society of free Ths may for ought we know build two or three Churches abroad seeing the  Devil  and he are known to be upon their Travels together  You have thus a Sketch of Satan's profess'd Correspondence with his Agents in the first and most early Days of the Magick Art if by those Subtilties he brought them into great Reputation among the People and in the Courts of Princes you are not to doubt but he found his Account in it for by gaining a Reputation to his Agents and at the same time keeping them at his Command for the sake of the Illuminations which they gained from him he had them always at his hand ready to do or undertake any thing however black which in the course of their Witchcrafts came in their way We shall find some flaming Examples of this kind very quickly  But for the present let us keep to our  Arab  as a Sample or Instance of the ordinary way of such People in their future Correspondences hitherto you see the  Devil  very assistant and in his way obliging to the last degree to his new Acquaintance the  Arab  I will for the present suppose he had no other Correspondent at least not in  Pharaoh  's Court nor was there any need of another but you are to suppose he had more such or such like in other Places  He had it seems found out the Way to make himself necessary to the  Arab  so that the Doctor could not bear the Thoughts of wanting his constant Assistance The Sense of this puts the  Arab  upon proposing to him that for the future the  Devil  should be so favourable to him as always to come to him whenever he had Occasion and this without obliging him to go into the Desart and up the Hill in search of him which many times the extraordinary Demands of the Court would not admit nor allow him time for  If the  Devil  did concede this Favour which was more than he granted to  Ali Albrahazen  for he obliged him to come to the Palmtree walk so  many times about it call aloud so many times upon him every Circle he made before he would come I say if he yielded to this at the Desire of his Acquaintance the  Arab  it was certainly for the great Ends which were to follow  Upon his new Proposal Measures were stated between them that upon such and such formal managing for there was some Reason it seems to make it a Piece of great Formality the  Devil  should always that is some of the innumerable Legions should always appear whether Satan himself or some of his Messengers Servants or  Gentlemen in waiting  History indeed is not so particular as that I should be able to give you the Names of them whether Christian Name or Sirname as in other Cases might be expected  The Forms of his appearing the Occasion the Conditions  c  being thus left to the  Arab  to determine as should be for his Occasion let us see how near we can come to the Particulars  Circles and Figures visible to others with some needful Cant or hard Words which might be made use of audibly as there might be Occasion these seem to have been appointed as the Pomp and Ceremony of the thing called Conjuring and Magick and might be found necessary for many Reasons and in several Ages these were varied and changed as the Magician and the Devil might agree about it between themselves  It was no doubt a great Condescention that the Devil would stoop to be always at hand and to come when he was called but he found his Account in it the  Arab  now had him at his Beck and whenever  Pharaoh  had any difficult thing to propose the old  Arab  could as they call it raise the  Devil  when he pleased to assist in it  This is what Aftertimes called having a Familiar and a familiar Spirit and is acknowledged to this  time to be frequently practis'd by Witches and Warlocks and what we find mention'd in Scripture  Menasseh  in particular tho' one of the Kings of  Judah  the Scripture is express in it  That he used Inchantments and dealt with familiar Spirits and Wizards  Kings xxi  Several hundred Years before this 'tis apparent by the Laws against such as these that such were and that doubtless while they were in  Aegypt  nay it must be there the Law is very express and reckons up several Sorts  Deut  xviii  There shall not be found among you  mark the Kinds  One that uses Divination  An Observer of Times  An Inchanter  A Witch  A Charmer  A Consulter with familiar Spirits  A Wizard  A Necromancer  then follows the just Character of those Practices  ver    For all that do such things are an Abomination to the Lord  Now from the same Text we shall prove that these were Practices in the Nations of that Part of the World even long before the Children of  Israel  came into the Land of  Canaan  See the same Chapter Verse  And because of those Abominations the LORD thy GOD doth drive them out from before thee  And again Ver  For these Nations which thou shalt possess hearkened unto Observers of Times and unto Diviners  Now such a one was this  Arab  let him act as he did and be that how it will 'tis evident he had a  Familiar  the meaning is he was in or under a Covenant with the  Devil  he had made an Agreement with the Apparition for continuing the Correspondence and for attending him constantly to  furnish him for his Predictions foretelling Events and acquainting them with secret and hidden things  These are the known Interpretations of these several Expressions  having a Familiar using Divination Inchantments  c All imply a Correspondence with the  Devil  to help them in such extraordinary Cases  Such a sort of People it seems there was among the  Canaanites  that is to say the  Phoenicians  and the Abomination was come to such a height and God had born with it so many Ages that now he was resolved to drive out those Nations for this very Crime Now as there were such People among the  Phoenicians  no doubt but there were such among the  Aegyptians  too from whom these People of  Israel  came out and who tho' with the  firstborn  of their Children slain in  Aegypt  the Loss of their Army and King in the Waters of the RedSea and other Calamities they were reduced low enough at the Time that we read of them yet were a strong and powerful Nation even from the time of  Mizraim  their greatest Monarch after  Cham    As they were a powerful and great People so they were a wise and learned Nation as Wisdom and Knowledge went then in the World and therefore we find that however the  Chaldeans  and  Arabians  boast that they were the first Searchers into the Mysteries of Wisdom and Knowledge and that the first Rudiments of the celestial Studies were conceiv'd among them which yet does not appear other than in their Pretences yet suppose it or suppose we were to grant it we still find that they went to  Aegypt  for their Practice and Encouragement that perhaps in  Arabia  they might drink in the first Knowledge and Principles of things But  Arabia  a Country always poor and not able to give Encouragement to Learning as we  say of a Neighbouring Country afforded Nothing but the dry Study they must go farther for the Improvement of it in short they might stay at home and get Knowledge but they must go abroad if they would get Money  This was the Reason that as it is at this time somewhere else as soon as the Poor Wretches had got a little smattering of  Arabian  Mountain Wit and a little Stargazing Knowledge away they went to  Aegypt  and there they set up immediately for wise Men and Conjurers and we scarce know what of Philosophers  The  Aegyptians  a wealthy but from the very Beginning a superstitious kind of People always hunting after secret Interpretations and hidden reserved Events poring upon rather than understanding mysterious things and loving to have strange Stories told them by any one especially Foreigners gaped eagerly after the fine Tales of these secondsighted  Arabians  dr  nk in their Magick as it was then called and freely parted with their Money to have their Fortunes told them and the Lines in their Palms explain'd to them by the crafty wandering  Arabs    On the contrary the cunning Artists that tho' they knew nothing of the matter at first yet seeing plainly that even that little was esteemed a great deal while the People they talked with knew less and finding the  Aegyptians  easie to be imposed upon willing to be cheated and particularly contented to have their Pockets pick'd for the Satisfying their simple Curiosity I say the cunning wandering Strangers made a good Market of them grew rich and famous among them and kept up the Reputation of their Craft by all the Subtilties of Wit and Invention  This Success encouraging their Studies we may easily suppose they pushed into all manner of natural Enquiries and as far as they were able improved  themselves and furnish'd their Heads with the Knowledge of human Things such as Reason Philosophy and natural Experiments might supply and at length pushing at every thing they found the way or he found it out for them as I have already observ'd to deal with the  Devil  And thus we are come at the Original of Magick as we now understand the Word that is to say of Diabolical Practices or a certain spreading of Delusions by the Assistance of the  Devil    CHAP VII  Of the Practice and Progress of Magick as it is now explain'd to be a Diabolical Art how it spread it self in the World and by what Degrees it grew up to the Height which it has since arriv'd to  WE have pitch'd upon  Aegypt  to be the Spot where the first hellish Artists study'd this that I now call Diabolical Magick I shall not keep you long upon the cold Scent It was practis'd there very early and very long before we heard much of it any where else but when it took a run when it started from thence we shall soon hear of it abroad For however secret the Black Part may be and however private the  Magicians  and their great Master the  Devil  manag'd their Correspondence yet the Practice of it and the Game they play'd upon Mankind by it was always publick and open as we shall have reason to say among other Nations as well as among our own  As to the Chronology of it and when it began in what Ages of the World those  Arabians  began to practise as above when they first dealt in this  Craft when the  Aegyptians  began to be their Scholars and they the  Devil  's it is not however ancient so difficult to come at the Knowledge of in general as some other things in the World which yet we think our selves very certain of  The Scripture  whether our good Friends that read Books in this Age will bear with our quoting it in Matters of Religion or no yet is generally allow'd to be a tolerable good History Nay if we may believe some good Authors it must be allow'd to be the most ancient History and the Writing from which all other Authorities take their Rise that  Moses  was long before  Berosus Homer Hesiod  or in a word any of the Writers on Earth Nor could it be well otherwise if what is lately advanc'd is true that the first Knowledge of Letters to write by and to read upon was dictated to  Moses  from Mount  Sinai  by the immediate Revelation of Heaven I say it could not be otherwise For how should they write before they had Letters and knew how to form the sound of Words upon the Tables where they were imprest  As  Moses  had the first Knowledge of Letters so he had the first Knowledge of Things too and was therefore the best qualified to be a Collector of Antiquities nor was it so difficult a Matter for  Moses  to write a History of the Creation and of all the material Events of things that had happen'd before his time as some may imagine Since by the Calculations of Time  Moses  might easily have an Account of those things by a successive Supply of  Oral Tradition  from  Noah  himself as you may gather from the Times wherein he liv'd and the Persons with whom he had convers'd of which take the following short Sketch as a leading Thread or Chain of things directly confirming my Argument  If  Moses  then had the most early Knowledge of things by a short Succession of the Persons relating them and that even from  Adam  and  Noah  in a right Line and if  Moses  had the first Knowledge of Letters even immediately from a superior Hand then at least you must allow me that  Moses  was certainly the best qualify'd to form a History of the first things  ran  cted in the World and was the first Man or at least the Man best able to write that History down For who could form a History of things they did not know and who could write before they had Letters to form the Words he was to write by and who could read what was written unless those Letters had been known and made publick in the World  Hence I infer that  Moses  was the first Historian and the Books of  Moses  are the first History in the World and if the first consequently most likely to be the best Authority at least as I have said above and that my Readers may not be push'd upon too hard to believe those Books which they have so ill a relish of I say at least they will allow that the Scripture or  Pentateuch  is a tolerable good History and that is all I ask of them as a Favour  Now to begin with the Chronology of things  The Law given to the  Jews  from the Mouth of the  Oracle  upon Mount  Sinai  of which  Moses  gives us the History was according to Sir  Walter Raleigh  published  Anno Mundi    Joseph  died    Moses  was born    The Children of  Israel  came out of  Aegypt    But we find in the History of  Joseph  and we find by the Commands to extirpate Witches and Sorcerers mention'd in the first Law given the  Israelites  I say we find the Practice of Diabolical Magick was much more ancient than  Moses  nay than  Joseph  and that it was practis'd so long  ago not only in  Aegypt  but in  Phoenicia  also and perhaps in the last as soon as in the first  First It seems that God resolv'd to drive out the  Phoenicians  that is the  Canaanites  before the Children of  Israel  even for this very Offence among others and I cannot come up to the modern rate of Scepticism as to believe God would have driven them out of their Country for a Crime which they were not guilty of and especially too that he would have assign'd that for a Reason of it which the poor People could have stood up and clear'd themselves of and have said they did not understand what it was  This goes far to a Suggestion that the  Canaanites  were guilty of it even four hundred Years before and before God's Promise to  Abram  to give him that Country or else we must suppose the  Canaanites  condemned to an Explusion before the Crime for which they were to be expell'd was committed and I can no more come into that than the other  Certainly GOD's Promise to turn out the Inhabitants for  Abram  's Posterity must be allow'd to be a Sentence of Condemnation upon the  Canaanites  even at that time and he would not have condemned them to Banishment I mean as a Nation for Crimes which they were not even then guilty of especially that very Crime being assign'd as the Cause of their said Condemnation and Sentence  If this Argument is just as I think it must be then I have gain'd the Point as to the Antiquity for then this Crime of Diabolical Magick is as ancient as  Abram  and 'tis evident  Abram  was born above fifty six Years before  Noah  died How long this wicked Trade was known before  Abram  we cannot determine but may grant it might be some considerable time  It is certain however that in the Reign of  Mizraim  who was but the Grandson of  Noah  they were grown very considerable I mean as to their Reputation in the  Aegyptian  Court and I am willing to suppose my old  Arab  was one of the Chief if not one of the first of them in  Mizraim  's Reign and perhaps near the Beginning of it For as the  Devil  introduc'd himself as it were Voluntier to him it should seem that he had no Correspondents of that kind there before and took that Method to begin his Acquaintance perhaps allowing his Correspondents to convey the same Method of Intelligence from one to another and perhaps to renew the Contract as often as he their Instructor thought fit  But be that how it will 'tis certain the  Devil  must be Aggressor in all Ages of this Art He knew well enough how to break in upon them how to show himself and make his Appearances to them as often as he thought fit and could begin it or renew it how and whenever he pleas'd But the Case was quite different on their Side for no body knew how to come at him they did not so much as know him when they saw him or know where he liv'd where he kept his Residence how to go to him or send to him or in a word to have any Correspondence with him but just as he thought fit to enter into a Familiarity with them and give them Methods and Rules by which they should obtain Audience of him when and as often us they had occasion  This being the case it is not to be wonder'd that the  Devil  and those Men of Craft became acquainted very soon in the World for the  Devil  is too diligent to neglect his own Affairs any longer than till they were ripe for his Agitation  Having then brought all the Southsaying and Magick of the first Ages as it were within his own  Management and establish'd a Correspondence with the wise Men of the most early Times we are next to examine how it proceeded and what Progress it made And in making this Inquiry it comes directly in my way to tell you a very unhappy Truth namely that the Clergy of those times seem to me to be the first Conjurers and Dealers with the  Devil  and so in all the subsequent Times and in all or most of the Distant Nations of the World I mean next immediately after those  Aegyptian  Proficients  I hope our Most Reverend and Right Reverend of the sacerdotal Order in these Days and in this wise Magical Age will take no Offence at me for this at least till I have farther and fully explain'd my self Far be it from us and sad would be our Circumstances should I venture to suggest that any of our Clergy should be Conjurers and deal in Magick no no plenty of Grace and paucity of Brains I hope is our establish'd Protection from such a dismal Eruption as that would be upon us  In order therefore to explain my self fully upon this Subject I must go back to the early Ages of the World even just where I was before The  Devil  after the Flood observing the World begin to fill and that the People spreading themselves over it began to People it again and form themselves into Nations and Governments one of his first Cares was to debauch their Principles as to Religion to dictate false Notions of Homage and Worship to them and in a word to introduce Idolatry  As he knew perfectly well the End he aim'd at so he was not at a loss to find out the Means It would be too long a Story to tell you in what manner he found out Gods for them to worship and how he canoniz'd their Heroes for them The  Tale of  Ninus  or  Nimrod  appearing to the wise Men in a Flame of Fire and telling them he was going just then up into Heaven from whence he would always shine upon them in the Shape of a Star and that they should build a Temple to the glory of his Memory that he should be call'd  Baal  or  Bell  which is as much as to say  a great God  and that he would be always ready to help them against their Enemies as he was to fight for them while he was alive  I say this Tale suppose it but a Tale was not at all unlikely to take with the People who had the Memory of their dead HeroKing fresh in their Thought and who were ready to idolize the very empty Sound of his Name Suppose the wise Men as they call'd them only feign'd or forg'd this Story and reported it to the People as a Vision which they had really seen tho' they had not seen it at all yet it was not unlikely to make Impressions upon them in their first Ignorance of things  But suppose on the other hand the  Devil  who is always awake should have really shown himself in such an Appearance and then have drawn in the wise  Magicians  of that Age upon seeing such a Sight frightful and horrid like the  Devil  that form'd it to relate as they might with Truth the Fact to the People It was not at all strange that the wise Men mention'd should go to the King with that Story also and that he the King bigotted by the  Magicians  and terrify'd as they were should immediately order a Temple to be erected Sacrifices to be appointed and a formal Worship set on foot to the Honour of this great God  Bell  whose Memory was so high in their Esteem before  History is very full of the first Fury of idolatrous Zeal and of the extravagant Branches of their Devotion I mean in their Princes  Ninus  built a House for the Worship of  Bell  the Walls and Towers are a Prodigy in themselves what the manner of Worship was we do not read tho' afterwards we have the Description of their abominable Rites as the Sacrifices to  Moloch viz  making their Children to pass through the Fire whether they were burnt to Death or horribly scorcht Authors do not yet resolve us The King of  Moab  sacrific'd his Son the Heir Apparent of his Throne upon the Walls of the City only to obtain Deliverance from the Siege by the help of his Idol at the Price of his Son's Blood  As those Idols were introduc'd by the Art of the  Devil  so it must be that the Direction came from him I mean as to the manner of the Idolworship and that he certainly held an immediate Correspondence with the Institutors and Managers of the Idol Rites  These were the Magicians and Astrologers who by his Directions were instructed what Ceremonies what Rites what manner of Worship to offer to their Gods and as they consulted the Magicians for the Institution of their Worship so in a few Ages after the Magicians or Southsayers were their Priests and their Priests were all Magicians and Southsayers Hence the Auruspices the Sacrificers and the Priests of the several Temples where Answers were given to Questions Events predicted and the like were the Givers of those Answers from the Oracle that is in plain  English  the Priests were Magicians and the Magicians were the Priests and the  Devil  brought  Witchcraft  and  Idolatry  to be at last but one Science  As he corresponded personally with  Ali Albrahazen  and the old  Arab  in the Infancy of time and when his Kingdom was as it were but just erecting and setting up in the World so when that Personal  Correspondence appear'd successful in setting up Idolatry he made it equally useful for the Propagating it and the Magicians became Priests in the Temples of their Gods  Nothing could be more agreeable to the Priests of their Idols than this Intimacy with the Infernal Spirits for the  Devil  who was always his Craft's Master fail'd not as well to delude the Priests themselves as by them to impose upon the World nor could he have carry'd on his Game upon Mankind without it For if the Priests had not believ'd that they convers'd with the Gods when really they convers'd with the  Devil  if they had been all let into the Secret and made to propagate their Religion as a Cheat upon the World to which they were to have been privy if it had all been known to be as it really was a Conspiracy against Heaven in Favour of the  Devil  and with real Design to impose upon and damn the World they would never have been brought universally to have kept the  Devil  's Council and have come into the Plot at the Price of their eternal Felicity and the Souls of all their Friends  The  Devil  's Plot would certainly have been blown long before it was and the Priests of the Oracles would most certainly have first or last have betray'd their Master and expos'd the whole Cheat But the Case was evidently this the  Devil  found the way to delude and impose upon the very Priests themselves and not only suggested to them but made them really believe that the Gods convers'd with them that the Voices they heard the Answers dictated by their Oracles the Apparitions  c  were all the real Appearances of their Gods those in particular whose Servants and Priests they were when in Truth it was no more than a gross Delusion and an Appearance of the  Devil    I make no doubt but that the Tumult rais'd by the Silversmiths at  Ephesus  tho' they in particular were touch'd with the sense of their Interest and the loss of their Craft and Trade yet was carry'd on in the Sincerity of their Ignorance by those who call'd her the Great Goddess  Diana  whom they and  all the World worshipp'd  that they who cry'd  Great is  DIANA  of the Ephesians  believ'd her to be so and had not the least Notion of their worshipping the  Devil    I doubt not but the Priests of  Apollo  at  Delphos  who waited there to give out the Answers to the several Enquirers that came with their Gifts to the Oracle believ'd that the said Oracles were issued by the GODS and especially by  Apollo  himself and little thought that they the Priests were Tools of the  Devil  to cheat and amuse the World and propagate Idolatry for which the true God who was highly affronted in the Fraud would one Day put them all to Silence  Thus far I think the Clergy are beholden to me very much for establishing their Honesty at the Expence of their Heads and telling you they were all Fools rather than Knaves At the same time it holds still and this part can never be deny'd that as the  Devil  carry'd on his Kingdom by the Art Magick or what we call the  Black Art  so the Priests were the Instruments both of the  Witchcraft  and the  Idolatry    How far the two Infernal Juggles are still carried on and whether the Priests in most Parts of the World our own God bless us always excepted are not Magicians and Dealers with the  Devil  even in their Sacreds and by the meer Consequence of their Office let the  Padres  and Men of the Tonsure tell us and give us Satisfaction if they can  We have now brought the Magicians of  Aegypt  and the Priests of the Pagan Temples to be something akin at least we may say I have brought them to be all of a Trade and I believe 'tis not very difficult to show you that as they serv'd the same Master so they had their Instructions by the very same Channel and from the same Original In a word that the Worship of the Gods which was indeed the Worship of the  Devil  was dictated in the very same way namely by an immediate Correspondence with the Devil and with all the Circumstances mention'd in the Text before quoted  viz  Divination Inchantment Conjuration Apparition Vision Dream Familiar Spirits observing Times observing Seasons and flying of Birds Entrails of Beasts and the like  It may seem a little difficult to bring all the Schemes of Idol or Pagan Worship down to a Level with Witchcraft and Diabolical Magick and some will tell us that several Parts of the Pagan Worship or even Paganism in general was establish'd upon pure and just Principles an exact and regular Virtue the height of Morals principles of Truth and of natural Religion of good Government and of Dedication to the publick Welfare of Mankind nay even upon Principles of Piety and a Homage to be paid to the Divine Being as the first moving Cause of Life and as a Debt due to that Being for all the good attending Human Life that nothing has been wanting in some Pagans but a Revelation from Heaven and an opening the Eyes of the Soul by Divine Inspiration to know the Only True God  Those that are of this Opinion support it by the Example of  Numa Pompilius  the Founder of the  Roman  Rites and to whom the establishing the greater part of the Pagan Ceremonies is justly assign'd who they tell us acted upon the highest  Principles of Morality and Virtue and even of Piety that he went even to the utmost length that Nature and Reason could go that he not only acknowledg'd a Supreme Power to whom Mankind ow'd his Homage for the good receiv'd and who would not fail in a Life to come to distribute Rewards and Punishments agreeable to the Life and Conduct of every Man here But own'd also that Worship as a Natural Debt to be paid by all Mankind hence upon the Door of the Temple of the several Gods he caus'd to be written as a Direction to all Mankind this short Precept  à Jove principium  intimating that every Action of Man's Life should be begun with Application to the Gods They add that  Numa  had a profound sincere Veneration for the Creator of all things as the Author of Life and the supreme God of Heaven and Earth and that he wanted nothing to be a sincere Worshipper of the true God but a true Revelation from Heaven inlightning his Mind and guiding him to know what way of Worship that God would be pleased to accept  They give us several other Examples of Great and Illustrious Men who tho' profess'd Heathens in the manner of Worship and the immediate Object yet form'd their Notions upon just and noble Principles strictly adhering to the natural Principles of Religion closely pursuing Justice in Government Impartiality in matters of Right preserving Virtue and Honour in the People and making wholsom Laws for their better Government upon all Occasions such are  Lycurgus  the  Lacedaemonian Confucius  the  Chinese Solon  the wise Philosopher and sundry others  They also name to us the Books of the  Sybils  which so far as they are discover'd they say are fill'd with summary Rules for wellgoverning Mankind and directing a due Homage to the great God  But let us look thro' all this God for wise Ends did not think fit to accept these little Emanations of Natural Light or to reveal himself to the Persons however sincere they may be said to be in the pursuit of Divine Light as then they were left to the dim and dusky Shadows of natural Reasonings only so it appear'd that those natural Reasonings were not sufficient to inform the Mind of Man concerning God But that when they had done all for want of farther Illuminations the  Devil  was suffer'd to chop in and confound all their brightest Ideas of Worship with a horrid Rhapsody of complicated Idolatry  This very Observation is sufficient or at least it might be expected that it should be sufficient to crush the Notions which our more Polite Gentlemen now advance in favour of the study of Magick as an Art or Science only They contend that the Word Magick is greatly mistaken and that we do not understand what we speak of that Magick is nothing else but a receiv'd wellguided way of thinking and acting that it is truly the Science of Reflection and the Art of making a right Judgment of things by giving every Object however distant its due Weight thinking of things according to the true Rate of them that the humane Judgment is in its self infallible and therefore in some manner equal to the divine Being a Light issued from Heaven and darted by Emanation into the Souls of Men which if rightly cultivated and improv'd and especially if sincerely follow'd adher'd to and obey'd guides the Soul to understand things in a superior way This they say is  Magick  the very Word which intimates a superior and divine Knowledge leads to understand what it means and this say they duly follow'd would from the Beginning have made Men be as the Serpent told them they should be  viz  like Gods knowing Good and Evil  Now these finespun Notions or Imaginations I say are fully answer'd by taking Notice that there is apparently no such Infallibility in Man's Judgment unless assisted by a yet higher and superior degree of Illumination that is to say unless GOD the Author of all perfect and compleat Illumination should add to it the Revelation of himself and of his Mind and Will giving the Man Rules and Laws for his farther Illumination and for the Direction of himself  This appears in the Particular mention'd above namely that notwithstanding Man's infallible Judgment led him to the Knowledge of a Divine Being and that there was a great first Cause Infinite Eternal and Superior because Prior to all Being and that this first Being had a Right to the Homage and Obedience of his Creatures yet 'till God by Revelation directed it all the Perfection of human Judgment could never lead Mankind to a right Knowledge of the Worship and Homage this Great Being requir'd But they sunk down into Idolatry worshipping many Gods and Images the Representations of Gods and in a word into the grossest and dullest Conceptions of things relating to their Deities such as one would think it was impossible humane Judgment under any manner of Improvement could fall into things unworthy of GOD nay unworthy of Men Hence they made their  Jupiter  tho' they call'd him the Father of Gods and Men a horrid Picture of ungovern'd Lust a Ravager of the World ravishing Innocence and Virtue transforming himself into divers Shapes to obtain his vicious Desires as into a white Bull to carry away  Europa  into a golden Shower to fall into the Lap of  Danaae  and the like Here is the Picture of infallible humane Judgment Wonder no more that at last it carry'd them all headlong into the Arms of the  Devil  and not only to be ignorant  of the Worship of the true God but to pay the Homage they ow'd to their Maker to him who was their Destroyer and Enemy  Thus  Numa  with all his Sincerity and Piety resolv'd all his Ideas into a confus'd Mass of idolatrous Ceremonies adorning the Priests forming new Orders and Degrees of his Clergy and in a word drawing a Scheme of pompous Paganism establishing Games and inhumane Fightings of Gladiators Races and Exercises for Sport in Honour of the Gods Besides crowding the City with Temples and Altars to innumerable and unknown Deities so that in a word after he had acknowledg'd that there was a supreme Power a GOD of all the Earth a great first Cause of Life and to whom all Homage was due I say after all these sublime Ideas he yet sunk down into the grossest of all Idolatries the worshipping imaginary Gods deifying the Stars of Heaven and offering Sacrifices building Temples dedicating Priests and making Vows to Stocks and Stones the Work of their own Fingers and the Idols of their own Brain  Will any one think we wrong the Pagan Institutions much less the Institutors to say that the  Devil  had a Finger in all this does not  Satan  in Policy suffer an Appearance of Virtue and Piety to be set up to mock the World into true Devilworship How could he set himself up to be worship'd as a  God  and how could he make himself truly the  God  of this World if he did not enjoin to his Worshippers at least seemingly some Forms of Life and appearing Principles agreeable to the Rules of Virtue and Honour 'Tis by this that in general he has carry'd on the Delusion and this as I may say has been the Magick of his Art as well as the Art of his Magick  The  Romans  were the most civiliz'd Heathens that the World ever saw their Government had  in it all the Appearance of Justice and Moderation they honour'd and rewarded Virtue and Honour Love to our Country Courage Gallantry How did they crown those that sav'd a Citizen give Triumphs to those that had conquer'd their Enemies give Prizes to those who excell'd in the most commendable Things How did they honour Chastity in their Vestal Virgins Temperance Eloquence Learning and Philosophy in the Persons of those that excelled and erect Statues to their Memory when dead  Yet all this while their Religion was Devilworship their Augurs and Southsayers and the Priests of their Temples and Oracles were Diviners  Magicians  Wizards and in the very Letter of it  Dealers with the Devil  and that in the worst Sense all their Sacrifices and their Institution of Games for appeasing the angry Gods were the most horrid and barbarous Pieces of Ignorance or hellish Cruelty and Brutality that could be imagin'd even sometimes to human Sacrifices and in all those excesses of their Devotion the  Devil  led them on blinded by strong Delusions to such Performances in order to appease the Wrath of Heaven as were unworthy of God inconsistent with his Nature as a bountiful beneficent Being as a fountain of Goodness and Mercy infinitely Compassionate to his Creatures and who could not take Pleasure in those things which were injurious to Mankind in order to be reconcil'd to them or be pacify'd by destroying those whom it was his glory to save and protect  All the while that they erected Temples to Justice to Honour to Virtue and to Peace they studied all possible ways by War and Blood to amass Treasures and enlarge their Empire 'till as the  Roman  Histories confess they left no Nation unsubdued except such as they found it not in  their Power or worth their while to Conquer that is to say such as the  Parthians  who were too powerful for them to conquer and so poor when conquer'd as not to be worth the Attempt or the  Indians  and  Aethiopians  who tho' rich yet were so remote and fenc'd by wide unpassable Desarts and protected by the excessive Heat of the Climate so that it was not in their Power to assault them Their Armies were not able to endure the March thro' the  Libyan  Sands or over the Mountains and vast Waters of  India  under or near the Equinox and where there was nothing to shelter or relieve them under the excessive and violent Force of the Sun  All the rest of the World as I have said they continually invaded and subdued and matter'd not the Reason and Justice of the War if the Reward of their Treasures and the Advantage of Governing them was apparent  Thus  Caesar  invaded the  Gauls  the  Helvetians  the  Germans  without any just Pretence of making War except only that of Conquest Plunder and Dominion What Pretence of War had the  Romans  against a quiet a remote an inoffensive Nation as the  Britains  certainly were They neither offer'd to disturb the  Roman  Government or were in Condition to do it having no Knowledge of Arms equal to any such Attempt no Alliances or Correspondence with any of the  Romans  Enemies no Ships to traverse the Ocean and make them terrible  Nothing call'd  Caesar  over hither to invade the innocent  Britains  but thirst of Glory and enlarging Dominion a Principle imbib'd from the tyrannick Nature of the  Devil  to raise humane Glory not by Deeds truly Great not by virtuous Actions but by destroying and insulting the Weak in Presumption of Strength and by shedding  Blood to triumph over the Wrongs and Oppression of their FellowCreatures  And what was the Reward of  Caesar  's Ambition and Thirst of Glory A Conquest indeed he gain'd but of what and for whom a Conquest of Innocence and a Conquest for the  Devil  the fruit of which was thus to be summ'd up They first and last destroyed two Millions some think five or six Millions of the Inhabitants they spilt also an Ocean  Roman  Blood eighty thousand  Romans  were killed at one time by the gallant Queen  Boadicia  at  Camolodinum  now  Malden  in  Essex  and after a Possession of above six hundred Years they were forc'd to abandon it with Infamy and Scandal and so ended just where they began  Whence was all this but from the  Devil  whose Government of the World had this Magick indeed always in it that it spread Cruelty and Tyranny in all Parts founded Dominion in Blood and made the World a Theatre of Rapin and Violence  This was the secret Magick of his Government and yet this was always carried on under the Mask of Justice Peace and Religion that is to say Avarice was Justice and to gain the Plunder of a Nation was a sufficient Pretence to quarrel with and subdue it Conquest then brought Peace that is to say when Rapin or Slaughter had impoverish'd or extirpated a People then the  Romans  gave them Peace and protected the Remnant and as to Religion the Substance of it was as above Cruelty and Superstition  This is the Sum of the  Roman Polity  and of the Methods taken in a Government and by a People who as above are said to be the most civilized of all the Pagan Nations and Governments in the World and this in a word serves to open the Eyes of Posterity and betrays the  Devil  's Conspiracy  against Mankind in the openest manner possible The Magick of Hell discovers it self here that under the specious Pretence of just Government and under the Fame of a civiliz'd Nation governing themselves and the World by the Rules of Justice and Virtue a Loose was given to all mander of Barbarisms Cruelty Blood and Oppression  It is clear in so many Examples that I need say no more to explain it that the  Roman  Government and the  Roman  Religion was all founded on a Diabolical Regimen and was maintained by the Magick and Ar  ifice of the  Devil  and his Instruments which Instruments were chiefly the Priests of the Idol Temples and Worship who by the Subtilty of their Arts Religious Art the worst sort of Magick made such deep Impressions on the Minds of the deluded World that not the common sort only not the Vulgar or as we say the  Canaile  the Mobb and Rabble of the People came into it and believed the lying Wonders but the learned World the Philosophers the Poets Men of the most exquisite Parts and the most polite Knowledge nay of the noblest Principles of Virtue and who had the most refined Ideas of Justice and Honour even these all came into the Delusions of this  Black Art  believed and as I may say relished the Witchcraft and Delusions of the Magicians and Sorcerers and were taken with their lying Wonders even the  Cato's  the  Tully's  the great and the greatest Heroes Philosophers Scholars 'twas all one they were swallowed up by the Arts of the Magicians and Southsayers nay their Kings stooped to deal in this  Black Art  themselves  Romulus  the Founder of the City of  Rome  and the first Father even of the  Roman  Name was himself a Southsayer that is to say a Magician a Diviner or Inchanter in plain  English  a Dealer with the  Devil  and the great Propagator of the infernal Art I say the great Propagator  of it for he was the first that instituted the  Augurs  in the Pagan Worship and as I said Hook'd in the Magicians into their Religion making all the Wizards and Conjurers Priests tho' I must insist upon it not  Romulus Numa  or the  Devil  himself could make all the Priests Conjurers no not to this Day  Some have been of Opinion that  Numa Pompilius  who I have said was sincerely inclin'd to Religion  s it was simply understood to be a meer Homage due from Man a Creature to God the Creator that he acted from a sincere Principle and that he went farther towards establishing the true Religion than any Pagan in the World ever did before him  But they add he was lost for want of revealed Light that having determined by the Light of his Reason that there was a God and that he was to be worshipped but not knowing how or in what manner that Worship was to be directed and not being able to find out by his utmost Search what Worship would be acceptable He sunk into Idolatry and Polytheism as the only Pattern that was before him with this Addition that having thus taken his Rise from a wrong Beginning his devout Temper hurried him on into all the Extremes of Idolatry and Paganism 'till at length he came into this very Mischief I am speaking of I mean Magick Sorcery and dealing with familiar Spirits that is the  Devil    This is just what I had said already but it is most certain that though at first they acted upon some Foundation of natural Principles or if you please Principles of Natural Religion Yet they afterwards run farther into this Sorcery and Southsaying and that with such an universal Gust of Inclination that it became a chief Part of their Religion and there were very few of their great Men nay even of their Kings and Emperors  but what were Magicians themselves and some of them if not all of them took it for a Part of their Imperial Titles and a Badge of their Honour to be called  Pontifex Maximus  and sometimes appeared in the Robes of a Sacrificer and of this or that Order of the Priests as they thought fit 'till at length unsufferable Pride and Insolence led them to accept of divine Honours themselves to lay aside the Priest and assume that of a God placing themselves so above the Sacrificer as to suffer themselves to be sacrificed to But this went but a little Way  At length the Christian Religion in spite of Persecution and obstinate Resistance both from the Jews as well as the Pagans began to spread it self in the World and as Christ himself says that he came to destroy the Works of the  Devil  so it appeared for immediately the Glories of the Pagan Superstition began to fade their Oracles ceas'd the Priests became dumb and the  Devil  not able to carry on the Cheat any farther threw it up the Augurs and Southsayers fled from the Face of the Christian Doctrine and from the Preaching of the Apostles and their Successors as not able to exercise their Sorceries and Divinations no not so much as in the Presence of the Christian Ministers  We have two remarkable Instances of this in the sacred Text one is  Acts  xiii when being at the Isle of  Cyprus Elymas  the Sorcerer ventured to withstand St  Paul  when he preached the Word of God to  Sergius Paulus  the Governour but for the audacious Attempt was struck blind by the miraculous Word of the blessed Apostle so being made an Instrument to confirm the Governour in his Faith and compleat the Conversion which the conjuring Wretch sought to oppose  ver    The Deputy when he saw what was done believed being astonished at the Doctrine of the LORD  The other Instance is in  Acts  xix where indeed there is a double Evidence  First  of the Power of the Christian Doctrine prevailing over the Magick and Diabolick Arts then in Practice and  Secondly  of the prodigious Encrease of those Magical Delusions among the  Romans  however wise and polite a People they were the Story is short and fully to the purpose St  Paul  preaching at  Ephesus  made a wonderful Progress in converting the Pagans of that great City to the Christian Faith Some Histories tell us he converted one hundred thousand People there and in the Country adjacent but that by the way In a word the Text says  ver    the Name of the Lord Jesus was magnify'd  And how but by this eminent Victory over the  Devil  For besides the Conquest of the Exorcists who went about to cast out a  Devil  by their Conjurings and Spells the Magicians themselves were converted by  Paul  's preaching and that to a prodigious Number of them  ver    Many also of them which used curious Arts brought their Books together and burned them before all Men and they counted the Price of them and found it fifty thousand Pieces of Silver  What a height must the Black Art of the  Devil  be come to at that time that the Books which were to be found in that one City should amount to such a Sum of Money I give this Account as I have said to let you see to what an extravagant height the  Devil  had carried this Matter and how and in what manner he supported his Interest in the World But I must go back to the Beginning of things where I left off  viz  at the Institution of the  Augurs  who were for some Ages the Engrossers of all these Delusions in the  Roman  Empire  The  Augurs  were a sort of  Roman  Priests who pretended to foretell Events by Omens by the chattering of Birds howling of Dogs and other uncouth Noises of any kind in the Air They were  erected into a Society and formed in a College of Hall by the King's special Order the Number at first was but three one being taken from every  Roman  Tribe and while they were thus few the Dignity was very valuable and it was highly esteemed among even the  Patricii  and Nobility  Servius Tullius  encreas'd their Number to Four and caused them to be taken only from the Nobility Afterwards  Quintus  and  Caeneus Agellinus  obtained that Five more should be added to their Number and should be chosen out of the  Plebeii  or Common People So ambitious were the  Romans  of this Diabolical Preferment and so much Honour had the  Devil  's immediate Servants in the World nay upon this Increase of their Number to Nine the Government was so resolute against lowering the Price of that Reverence and Esteem they had among the People that they passed a Decree against encreasing their Number any more  However  Sylla  one of the most bloody and cruel Tyrants of his Time that he might according to Custom join his Care of Religion to his Thirst of Blood added six more so that now their Number was fifteen The eldest whether in Years of longest standing in Order I am not positive which was made Father or President of the College and had the immediate Direction of all the rest  Their Privileges like their Institution were exorbitant for they were never to be deposed or expelled no not for any Crime how great soever nor their Places filled up by another  NB  Crime did not render the  Devil  's Agents scandalous in their Profession but rather the wickeder they were the fitter for the Priesthood or Augurate How far the same Maxim may hold in some of the sacred Order in the World at this time if I was of their Number I should not vote to have it examined  And now for the Ceremonies of the Augurs Trade for we must note that the Art Magick had always abundance of dark and uncouth Usages attending it as it has to this Day raising the  Devil  was not done with a Whistle like calling a Dog or with a Beck of the Head or Hand as we beckon to Servants when we call them silently to come near us the  Devil  knew very well that his Affair must be clothed with Ceremony or it would not take with the World or at least would not hold long in it  The Pagan Rites were indeed loaded with Burthensome Ceremonies all the  Devil  's Worship was filled with Conjurings and Mutterings strange Gestures Agitations Ecstasies and I know not how many Distortings of the Limbs and Countenances wild Practices and frightful Noises that filled the People with Terror and with a kind of awful Horrour at the Majesty of their Gods  The  Augurs  Observations were attended with a great Variety of those things as the  Apparatus  to their Visions or whatever else they were to be called The Augur first placed himself upon a high Tower like one of our Observatories and perhaps the Tower erected upon a high Hill as upon the  Mons Palatinus  in  Rome  Here he seated himself in the clearest Day or in a Starlight Night to observe what came by him or in his Sight by Day or what he might hear or see by Night  He held in his Hand a  Lituus  that is a crooked Staff with which he used a great many wild Gestures and Motions and he had on his grave  Laena  that is his Southsaying Gown or Mantle He placed himself always with his Face to the East and at his first fixing his Station he utter'd certain Sentences and exotic barbarous Words which none knew the Meaning of but the  Devil  and himself  Being thus seated and fix'd as I have said he quarters out the Heavens or Hemisphere rather into four Parts or Regions each Quarter having beforehand such and such Predictions assign'd to it If it was Day then he was to mark every Bird that rose up or came flying by or towards him which of the said four Quarters he first appear'd in and then killing his Sacrifices and muttering over certain Sentences joyning some petitionary Speeches to such or such a Deity or Daemon rather which Speeches were call'd  Effata  he then proceeded to Divination  If it was in the Night he observ'd in the like manner any fiery Meteor any flying or shooting Fires any sudden Vapour as the Nights are full of such things or any Cloud eclipsing the Light of any particular Planet or Star of the first Magnitude and then he proceeded in the same manner only with some particular Words and Mutterings as regarded the several Appearances respectively  In the Night it was said they had the Company of several Spirits assisting them and communicating to them the Knowledge of the Things they desir'd Their Divinations were arbitrary and positive nor durst any Man ask or enquire of them the Reason of what they predicted or how they came to know that it would or should be so and so A Provision I must confess very prudent in the Priests and which as the case has stood with some of them would be very much to their Convenience to this Day as I shall show in its Place  By this taking such a kind of State upon them they politickly preserv'd the Reverence and Esteem of their Order and imprinted a kind of Awe in the Minds of the People concerning not the Holiness of their Persons only tho' that went a great way but concerning the divine Mysteries as they were call'd which were put into their Hands and they  were look'd upon as Persons to whom the Gods had committed the most secret Things that were otherwise known only to themselves and were communicated to the  Augurs  Favourites of the Gods for the good of Mankind  A Learned Author speaking of this Mystery of Southsaying says it came first from the  Chaldeans  who taught it to the  Greeks  of whom  Amphiaraus  was an eminent Proficient but he mentions nothing of who taught it the  Chaldeans  in which I believe my Account is the most authentick namely that the  Devil  taught it to the  Arab  I have mention'd or to some other if any was before him that these gave it to the  Aegyptians  and  Chaldeans  and  Phoenicians  much about the same time and that the  Phoenicians  taught it the  Greeks  their Prince  Cadmus  being an eminent Southsayer and so you see its blessed Original  In a word as it is a particular Familiarity with the  Devil  and depends entirely upon his Assistance so no body can contend that he was not the first Introducer of it as an Art since as I observed he might easily begin a Correspondence with Man but it was utterly impossible that Men should begin a Correspondence with him or know where to find him and how to call him to their Assistance whatever the Occasion might be without his Direction Assistance and Consent  As to the Introducing it from one Nation to another it may indeed be something difficult to assign the manner But as to the meer divining upon the flying of Birds upon Noises and Appearances in the Air the Chattering of Pyes the Croaking of Frogs and Ravens and the like I take much of that to be meer Juggle and Legerdemain of the Priests and Augurs and they have carry'd on the juggling Trade to a great Perfection in the same  Country to this Day  stand clear  DOMINICANS of which hereafter  But now for a downright Converse with the  Devil  I don't understand that Satan ever ty'd himself down by Articles that not only such and such a Man as my  Arab  or  Ali Albrahazen  of whom I have spoken should be able to call him up when they pleas'd by such and such Forms Ceremonies Voices and Sounds but that to whomsoever they should communicate the same Tokens or Watchwords they should have the same Power and that the very Words should call him or his Agents up to an Appearance whoever made use of them  This would have been to have the  Devil  bind himself Prentice to them and their Heirs for ever and to have chain'd himself down Gallyslave like to the sound of the Words which I take to be quite wide of the Case nor would it serve his Designs for the  Devil  loves to know his Agents and not be at the call of every Boy because perhaps his Grandmother told him the Words which she used to raise the  Devil  with or because the  Devil  and she had agreed upon the Matter But no doubt Satan who is certainly the Author of all this kind of Magick and which therefore and for that very Reason is call'd by his Name  Diabolick  I say no doubt as he is the only Teacher of the Art so he teaches it immediately by himself that is he make  Men  Magicians  and Wizards and makes old Women Witches ay and young too by an immediate Converse and Contract with them only and between them and himself Nor does he stick at the Pains of beginning anew with every Person and in every Country and this is the Reason why the Black Art as we righteously entitle it is not the same in all Countries nor is the  Devil  talk'd to in the same Words for then all the Witches and  Magicians  of every Nation must learn the same Language but on the contrary as the  Devil  talks all Languages when he pleases so he talks to every one of his Disciples in their own Mother Tongue and directs them to do the same to him so that a  Roman  Wizard calls him up in  Latin  a  Tuscan  Conjurer in  Italian  a  High German  Doctor makes his Circles and casts his Figures and talks Magick to him in the suitable Tongue call'd  High Dutch  the secondsighted  Highlander  in  Irs  and the  Lancashire  Lady in  English    So propitious so civil so wellmanner'd is Satan to all his Drudges and Devotees that he to put them to as little trouble as possible stoops to hearken to their Summons as they think fit to express themselves in their own or any Language Nay tho' the  Magicians  sometimes form a Cant of their own by which they amuse their Clients yet their familiar Friend takes it in good part and onverses with them in their own way  Even the poor  Indians  Pawaw with him in the Language of the most Northern  America  the  Banians  in the Language of the East  Indians  the  Islanders  of  Amboyna  in the Language of the  Celebes  and  Moluccos  and the  Chinese  in that of  Grand Tartary    The  Magicians  seem to act in this Part as if the  Devil  condescended to them not they to him but then this makes it evident that he converses Personally with them all that he makes his Bargains and Agreements with them always separately in all Places and in all Languages whereas if he gave them a general Commission to empower others to divine inchant and raise the  Devil  or evil Spirits they must all understand one universal Language  The sum of the Matter is this the  Devil  as a Learned Author says has three ways by which he carries on his Kingdom in the World and by  which he works all his Wonders which amuse and deceive them  By moving the Affections and Thoughts of Men whether sleeping or waking and this as it respects his causing them to dream on any Occasion as he thinks fit is one very considerable Branch of his Power  By his exquisite Knowledge of Nature by which he turns the Causes of things to his own Purposes and often brings to pass such Events as suit with his particular Occasions  By Illusion and Fraud imposing upon the Senses binding and blinding the Understanding and the Eyes both of the Body and of the Minds of willinglydeceiv'd Men  NB  And I may add a fourth which perhaps he was not acquainted with in former times namely by familiar Agreement Compact and Contract with the Bright Men of the Times who he brings over to converse and correspond with him and who he acts by and allows them to play their Game and his own together and this is Magick  Having then establish'd a Correspondence with Man we are not to wonder if to gratify his new Correspondents he empowers them to act abundance of strange and unaccountable things in the World that they may by that means obtain a Reputation of being wiser and craftier than their Neighbours and may also be admir'd and esteem'd first and consequently believ'd  These Wonders they work by his immediate Hand by his Power and Assistance as well as Direction and this I call  Magick  and it is so in the worst Sense  To this he subjoins a Power as it may be call'd over himself authorizing the  Magicians  or Conjurers  to summon him in to their Aid whenever they have Occasion for him to demand his Presence and Assistance whenever they please It was said of  Hamed  an  Aegyptian  Sorcerer that he had the  Devil  so at his Command that if he did but draw a Circle upon the Ground and stamp with his Foot in the middle of it the  Devil  would appear and bring as many Devils with him as the  Magician  stampt several times on the Ground and that upon their so appearing he could again send them of such Errands and for the Dispatch of such Business as he requir'd whether to do good or evil to bring on Mischief or to prevent Mischief as he that so call'd him up pleas'd to direct but I do not vouch the Truth of the  Devil  's Complaisance in this Particular nor see the Reason of it  If the  Magicians  in those ancient Days had such Influence upon him 'tis undoubtedly true that they did him great and signal Services for and by it or else Satan who does not use to dispence his Favours  gratis  must have some secret View in it which they or we have not yet discover'd  This great Use which the  Devil  makes of  Magicians  and Conjurers is a certain Discovery that he is confin'd by a superior Hand in his Workings and that he can only act by Stratagem by Cunning and Craft not by Force and Power  It is reported of a Sorcerer in  Rome  that he could call for Lightning and Thunder whenever he pleased and that the  Devil  would produce it for him but that calling him up once to procure Thunder that should burn a House and do great Mischief to gratifie the wicked Design of the Conjurer he told him No he could not gratifie his Revenge so far at least not at that time and that the same Sorcerer did at last confess that the Spirit which he convers'd with could show his Power  many ways in a miraculous manner but could not do any Mischief by it  It may be true and no doubt is so that the  Magicians  were they fully empower'd and at Liberty would really do more Mischief than the  Devil  himself had he the same Power not that their Malice can be greater but their Policy is certainly less and as they do not see so far before them as he does so they do not always see into the Reason of things and whether it would be for the common Interest or no for Example were the  Devil  empower'd to fire Houses destroy Families lay waste Kingdoms he might encline to do it but his Prudentials and Politicks might sometimes tell him that it would be more for his Interest to let it alone and so the  Magicians  likewise find it I say for their common Interest to act by Craft and Subtilty as their Master the  Devil  has done before them rather than by open Rage and Fury I mean for their common Interest as  Magicians  The  Devil  could without doubt in the ordinary Exercise of his Power as a Spirit burn kill destroy and in some sense put an end to God's Creation But this would not answer his End he knows his Maker is his Governour and could if he pleas'd punish him immediately even as he expresses it in the Scripture  before his time  And he knows likewise that when he had destroy'd and made havock of Mankind God could with the Breath of his Mouth form a new Species and that such a Kind as he should have no Power over and therefore 'tis not in short the  Devil  's Interest to make that Spoil in the World which as an Angel as a powerful Spirit he might do and especially if we suppose him not to be chain'd and fetter'd down to superior Limitations which however we know to our infinite Satisfaction that he is  In a word the  Devil  's Business and all his Aim is not to destroy but to damn Mankind not to cut him off and put his Maker to the trouble of a new Creation but to make him a Rebel like himself and even this he is fain to bring to pass by Subtilty and Art making use of Man against Man arming Flesh against Spirit and setting Nature in Defiance of the God of Nature and this by secretly corresponding with some of the worst and vilest abandon'd Wretches that he can find instructing them and teaching them his own Methods and so making them Traytors to their own Kind drawing them in to engage with him in ruining the Souls and Bodies of others and concerting Measures with these corrupted Instruments whose Principles he has first debauch'd that they may act and do for him and in his Name all the Mischief which he finds it is not for his Purpose to do himself  While he thus lies behind the Curtain himself and is not seen or at least not publickly he corresponds most punctually with these Agents empowering and directing them by a great variety of hellish Arts and Contrivances to work Wonders amuse and impose upon Mankind and carry on all his Affairs for him And this is that we call the Black Art and so I am come back to my Text  If it be true that the  Devil  is the Prince of the Air then he can form Tempests in it can poison and infect it so as that all Creatures Humane as well as sensitive and vegetable should perish in it But as he is yet a Prince under Limitations and Restrictions so he can exert no more Power than he has and when his humane Agents who are therein worse Devils than himself would be for Conflagrations and general Destruction He wisely or rather cunningly puts them off and diverts them without telling them or giving them room to  think that he really has not Power himself to enable them  It is impossible to close this Article of the  Magicians  Power being limited without an agreeable Reflection upon the modern Furies of our Age your Party Leaders and Politick SchemeMakers what merry work they would make in the World if the  Devil  their Head Engineer was not limited and not in Condition to trust them with the Power of doing Mischief as they desire it  Perhaps the Sense of this Limitation in the Power of their chief Correspondent is one Reason that however studious they are to do Mischief yet they have not so much studied the Diabolical Art as they would otherwise have done in a word they are not compleat  Magicians  because they see the Black Art is not wicked enough for them and they cannot obtain a Power by it to outsin the  Devil    But I come back to the Art it self The Artists are certainly very helpful to the  Devil  as well as the  Devil  to them For as he is oblig'd to work by Stratagem not by Force all his Cunning is employ'd to carry on his Kingdom and Government in the World and this brings me to the Reason why the  Devil  does not care to act in Person in most cases of his Administration but to employ those People whom we call  Magicians  that they may act with his full Directions and tho' with Art yet with Power also sufficient to stand his Ground against all humane Opposition  Under the Cover of these Agents he acts with infinite Success by their Influence he carries on all his Affairs and especially those of Kingdom and Dominion in which it is not for want of Impudence if he does not rival or indeed dethrone his Maker By his secret Correspondence with them it is that he fills the World with sham Wonders and false Stories which being detected and  exposed reflects upon the  Magicians  not upon the  Devil  neither indeed ought it to affect him for that it is not for want of his Assistance if any of them miscarry but from their expecting more from him than it is fit he should grant or than perhaps it is in his Power to grant No wonder then he is so officious and so willing that he runs and goes and dances Attendance upon a set of ignorant  Magicians  I say ignorant except only as he instructs them 'tis evidently because he makes his Advantage of them and they act for his Account  'Tis then apparent that the  Magicians  are Instruments by which the  Devil  carries on his Politick Affairs in the World It is time then in the next Place to enquire in what manner they perform it and from what Principles they act and then we shall come to some Historical Account of their merry Proceedings in the World  A SYSTEM of MAGICK PART II  INTRODUCTION  Of the  Black Art  it self what it really is why there are several differing Practices of it in the several Parts of the World and what those Practices are as also what is contained in it in General  _I Have all along till now spoken of the general Correspondence of the  Devil  with Mankind under the Head of  Diabolick Magick  as a meer Intimacy only I have represented it as a Method which the  Devil  first took to form his Interest and Acquaintance with Mankind when he was drown'd out of his Kingdom in the old World by the Flood  'Tis too certain that the  Devil  acted by this Method at first for the Propagation of his own Designs only and to set on foot a new Administration of his Affairs it being for many Reasons not his Business to act openly and barefacedly in the World as a  Devil  but now 'tis also as apparent that after the  Devil  had thus established a Correspondence he soon found Man as forward as himself as willing to embark with him and engage as he could desire nay so forward in the new Trade so eager for Mischief so glad of being vested with Power tho' Infernal to do it and to gratify those vilest of his Passions Envy Revenge Malice and Strife that the  Devil  himself as is observed in the last Chapter is forced to restrain him and gently to divert his Thoughts to some less violent and less destructive Methods not being willing and sometimes indeed not being able to act so much the  Devil  as these new Hellfire Agents would have him at it  The Correspondence being thus settled between the  Devil  and the Magician and the Treaties between them signed ratified and exchanged in Form the Instrument Man is immediately furnished by the Employer Satan with all necessary Qualifications for his Business and is compleatly qualify'd for an Infernal Mountebank and so he falls to his Jugglingbox and to shewing his Tricks his Pawawing and Conjuring and in a word exercising his new Acquirements and Hellish Talents upon Mankind and this we call and that with a great Propriety of Speech the BLACK ART  The brief Definition of what we call the  Black Art  that is to say as I would have it be understood in the rest of my Discourse is that it is a new general Term for all the Branches of that Correspondence which Mankind has maintained or does or can carry on between himself and the  Devil  between this and the Infernal World comprising all the eight Particulars which I mentioned before as they are taken from the Prohibition of them and the Declaration against them in the Law of  Moses  viz  Divining  the same as  Southsaying    Observing  of  Times    Using  Inchantment    Witchcraft  Charming  or setting of Spells  Dealing with  Familiar Spirits    Wizardizing  or  Sorcery  thought to be the same as Witchcraft but mistaken  Necromancing  The Practice of these or of any of them or of all of them is what we are to understand by this general Term the  Black Art  and as these several Parts are express'd after a differing manner and perhaps practis'd in a differing Form in several and remote Parts of the World it may be necessary to give a brief Description of them one by one that so when we name them apart I may yet be rightly understood and may need no more Digressions for Explanation of Terms as I go on    Divining  A Diviner I understand to be the same as was antienly called a  Southsayer  this is expresly confirm'd in Scripture if you will take its Authority for any thing  Acts  xvi  A certain Damsel possessed with a Spirit of  Divination  met us who brought her Master great Gain by  Southsaying  So that  Divination  and  Southsaying  is the same thing    NB  Observe that this Divination is here called a Spirit that is to say the  Devil  or a  Devil  and he was really in her for 'tis said  Paul  cast him out of her  This Southsaying also as we are to understand it contained all those lesser Pieces of lowpriz'd Art called telling Fortunes resolving Difficulties finding out and discovering secret things and perhaps all the juggling Part practised at this time and that without any Correspondence with the Spirit  Python  that  Paul  cast out or any other Spirit but that of Fraud and Legerdemain which the Divining or Southsaying is only made a Cover to    Observers of Times  These I take to be some who by Correspondence with an evil Spirit declared such and such Days or Times to have a particular Fatality so that no Business which was undertaken on that Day could prosper and this Part of the Black Art may take in such as carrying on the Study of judicial Astrology to the extreme and to the Gates of Hell ascribe Events of Things to the Government and Influence of the Stars and that Influence to be so or so directed for Good or Evil according to the particular Position Opposition Conjunction or Situation of those Stars or Planets in differing Houses as if these could be the Directors of the Fate of Persons Families and Nations and that the Events of things were directed by them and by the Seasons and Times of their Stations here or there in the Course of their ordinary Motion whether direct or retrogade In a word the Practice of judicial Astrology tho' not a dealing with or by the Help of the  Devil  is condemn'd here as being a plain robbing Divine Providence of its known Glory in directing and disposing both Causes and Events in all things relating to the Government of Mankind or indeed of the whole World and ascribing that to the poor innocent unconcerned Stars or Planets which is singly in the Disposition of him that made them The Stars and Planets are no intelligent Beings they have indeed a vegetative or active Life but as to  Knowledge or Acquaintance of or with human Affairs they are entirely lifeless Bodies utterly incapable of influencing or directing any thing or of any Motion or Action other than by the Direction of the same Power and Providence which made and guides them in common with the rest of the World    Using Inchantments  These are variously describ'd by the Ancients but to explain it by our modern Terms of Art this is what we call Conjuring and this is certainly performed by the immediate Agency and Assistance of the evil Spirit when the Magician using these Inchantments works by the secret Aid of the  Devil  some wonderful thing so as to surprise the Beholders and make them think the Operator is vested with supernatural Power and consequently is some extraordinary Man Thus when St  Paul  healed the lame Man at  Lystra  the People surprised with the Miracle cry'd out presently  The Gods are come down to us in the Likeness of Men  Thus the Magicians in  Pharaoh  's Court made Frogs turn'd the Water into Blood and the Rods into Serpents by their Inchantments that is to say by the immediate Hand of the  Devil  who was permitted it seems to increase the Plagues of  Aegypt  doing Mischief being his particular Talent But I do not read that whenever  Aaron  and  Moses  denounc'd any of those Plagues the Magicians could stop or prevent them if they could have done that indeed they had been worth Notice but it was quite otherwise for lest they should boast too much of their Power they were restrained and not able to make Lice tho' they had made Frogs and Serpents but they were obliged to acknowledge in publick that they were unable to do it that it was the Finger of God and that he had put a stop to their Inchantments in a word it made them acknowledge that according to an  old Proverb which for ought I know is derived from thence  GOD is above the Devil      Witchcraft  This is indeed the blackest part of the Black Art it self I need not describe it any farther than this that it is a Power received immediately from the  Devil  to do Mischief to gratify Rage Envy Malice Revenge and the vilest Passions of Men giving it into their Hands to bewitch Men Cattle Places and Things to burn and destroy tho' limited as hinted before in many Particulars the Effects of this Witchcraft we often see and shall say more to it in its Place  This includes Persons being immediately agitated by an evil Spirit carried often violently into the Air by the Help of the  Devil  and being able to carry away others in the Air also and not to insist upon all the improbable things said of them and said to be done by them yet that the  Devil  certainly plays his Pranks by those Tools sometimes in a most extravagant manner I must grant Why it is generally practis'd by old Women only is a Point to be consider'd by itself  In this Article of Witchcraft is included what we call an Evil Tongue an evil Eye Cursing Blasting Bewitching and abundance of Hellish things which those Creatures are permitted to practise to the Hurt of those that they point their Malice against    Charming  This is certainly a Piece of the Black Art and consists of divers Branches such as setting Spells drawing Circles within which if the Person to be operated upon sets his Feet he shall not be able to stir out of the Compass of it without Leave from the Charmer likewise Dozings giving Filters Potions and Hellish Contrivances to cause Barrenness Impotence Idiotism Lunacy Love Hatred and abundance more nameless Wickednesses which nothing but the  Devil  and Father of Mischief could empower them to do    Dealing with Familiar Spirits  This is what was more immediately proper to a Magician I mean such a Diabolical Magician as I have been describing and as the Title expresses it is an immediate conversing with a  Devil  who always attends him at his Call to come and go as he pleases to consult with be advised and directed by and in a word to do for him whatever He the Magician desires  Thus we read that King  Menasses  dealt with the  Devil  the Text says expresly  he used Witchcraft and Inchantments and dealt with a familiar Spirit  And who could doubt it from what followed nothing but a Man abandoned to Hell and that had the  Devil  at his Elbow could have been prevailed with to do what he did which at that time was the most dangerous piece of Impudence that ever had been heard of  viz  to set a carved Image in the very Temple the House of God    Wizards  This some take to be nothing but what they call a Man Witch but in the Practice it hath been carried farther namely to be one that consults with the  Devil  to give Answers to difficult Questions to reveal and discover Conspiracies and to govern the greater things of Life as to blast or succeed the Enterprizes of Princes and People to tell and foretell the Success of such and such Undertakings and even to influence the Undertakers Such a one as this was  Baalim  who being fam'd for a Wizard was sent for a long way by the King of  Moab  to curse the Camp and Army of the  Hebrews    The Northern Word used in our own Country for this Kind is a  Warlock  the antient Import of which was one that could give good or bad Speed to any Undertaking or at least could foretell whether the thing enquired about should succeed or no  We have abundance of merry Tales scatter'd abroad in the Oral Tradition of antient times and among those antient things called  Old Women  concerning Wizards how the Kings and Princes used to consult with them before they undertook any great Enterprize They tell you in the North how an old Wizard warned King  James  IV of  Scotland  who was killed at  Flodden Field  not to pass the  Tweed  with his Army but encamp on the Northern Bank of the River and that if the  English  passed the Water of  Tweed  to attack him he should certainly defeat and overthrow them but that if he fought on  English  Ground he should lose both his Army and his Life which accordingly happen'd They relate the same of old Mother  Shipton  in  England  who tho' so many Fables are made of her was a real and known Person and was not a Witch or a Prophetess but a  Warlock  or Wizard and 'tis certain she did foretell to Cardinal  Woolsey  his falling into Disgrace at Court his Loss of the King's Favour and his Death all which accordingly happen'd  The last of these is a  Necromancer  a Word very antient and containing indeed the Black Art in its full Perfection this being One who not like the Wizard foretold or predicted but who when the People came to him would carry them to his Originals that is to say would go to work and bring the  Devil  up by his Art to talk with and do their Business for them himself and this indeed might properly be said to be a Teacher of the Black Art that is to say not that he could tie the  Devil  down to appear to the Person whoever it was that he took a Fee of and be at his Summons as he was before at his the  Necromancer  's own but if ever any Person had a mind to come into the wicked Class and have a Personal Conference with the  Devil  in order to make a Bargain with  him the Necromancer's Business was to raise the  Devil  present the Stranger bring them acquainted and then leave the  Devil  and the Man to agree the Matter among themselves  In a word the Necromancer like the famous Mr  Whiston  of good lying merry Memory was the  Devil  's Broker neither more or less he brings Grift to the  Devil  's Mill Customers to his Shop and farthers his Trade and his own Gain by the ordinary Method of his Employment  It is true these blackest of the  BlackArt Men  have a great many other things in their Practice besides that of brokering for the  Devil  they were used to raise Storms Whirlwinds and Hurricanes by which they made themselves very terrible to the People as if it was in their Power to do all the mischievous things in the World By this they brought in their Customers for the People usually brib'd them as the  Indians  worship the  Devil  that he may do them no Harm The strong Opinion the common People had of these Men in time past was such that they would go to them for Rain in Drought and for fair Weather in Harvest for Abatement of Floods and for protecting their Cattle in Lightning and Thunder  To sum them up all the Diviner and Southsayer the judicial Astrologer and Conjurer the Inchanter and Charmer the Witch and the Wizard the Necromancer and Dealer with a Familiar Spirit all put together and practised in their fullest Extent make up this  One Black Art  which I am speaking of in its Perfection and in this Sense I am to be understood in the following Part of this Work  Only take a few Hints by way of Observation on this Occasion  viz  that the  Devil  has some little Outlyers and sculking Operators in the World and which he makes great use of which may not be said to come under any of those Denominations as  particularly our Secondsight Men in  Scotland  the Wind Merchants in  Norway  who sell fair and foul Weather Storms and Calms as the  Devil  and you can agree upon a Price and as your Occasions require Also in  Lapland Muscovy Siberia  and other Northern Parts of the World he is said to act by differing Methods and govern his Dominions by a more open and arbitrary Method not prescribed and limited to Art and Craft as he does here  We have also some new Practitioners in Magick among ourselves who deal with the  Devil  in a more exalted sublime Way and who for ought I know are able to teach the  Devil  some new and more accurate ways of managing them and the rest of the World too than ever he knew before In a word instead of enquiring at the  Devil  's Oracle and learning from him I think the  Devil  must even come to School to them for as  Alphonsus  of  Castilo  said  If God Almighty had consulted with him when he made the World he could have shewed him how to mend it  So certainly if the  Devil  had consulted these Gentlemen in his first Rebellion they might as well tell us they would have shewn him how to have martial'd his Army better and perhaps not have lost the Day as he did at least they would take upon them to give him new Measures for his present and future Conduct that so he may rebell against Heaven again whenever he pleases and shall be sure to carry on the War at least defensively with better Success than ever he did before  We have also some modern Sects of Hellish Divinity not formerly known no not to the  Devil  himself which seem to partake of the  Black Art  in a peculiar manner and which tho' not contain'd under any of the eight Heads already mention'd yet the Professors claim to be incorporated among the  Devil  's Graduates and may be justly esteemed Members of the Society of Deceivers and that  they have practised the  Black Art  in a more exquisite Method than any that ever went before them of whom and of their Art and Management if I may obtain a  Freedom of Thinking  in an Article of such Importance as this I may give you a very profitable Description in the Process of this History  There remains a Vacancy too for our Friends of the Legend and Calendar among whom we shall find certain Red Letter  BlackArt Men  who deal with the  Devil  under the sanctify'd Vizor of the  red Hat  the  Coul  and the  Tonsure  among whom I say many have been and many still may be Agents of Hell in the most abstracted Sense and therefore cannot be denied to be Practitioners in the  Black Art  as effectually and to all Intents and Purposes as fully as ever the Monks of  Loudon  or the Patrons of Father  Jetzer  and the  Maid of Kent  of all which in their Order  CHAP I  Of Modern Magick or the Black Art as now in its Practice and Perfection  THE antient Magick having by a long Succession of Art and Time been handed down to the  Grecians  and from them to the  Romans  we cannot but acknowledge that they went a great way to the improving it for they mingled the  Black Art  so entirely among their religious Worship that it is not to this day possible to distinguish between the Rites and Ceremonies of their Gods and the Inchantments and Charms Conjurations and Divinations immediately directed by the  Devil    I have mentioned something of this already in their  Augurs  and the several Institutions of  Romulus Numa Pompilius  and others but nothing so effectually discover'd the  Black Art  to be blended with their Religious Rites and the Craft of the  Devil  with the Worship of their Gods as the setting up  Oracles  giving Responses and solving Doubts as if by Enquiry of the Gods whereas indeed it was all managed by the Craft of the  Devil  and the Agency of those solemn Knaves the Priests and this I call Ecclesiastick Magick  There was not a little Knavery in the setting up the Augurs in the Divinations and Predictions from the flying and chattering of Birds and before that in the Priests poring upon the Intrails of the Beasts sacrificed to their Gods Here this Art went such a length that the Truth is the Devil saw himself outdone by the Priests and the Witchcraft of Superstition went beyond all that Satan himself ever pretended to in the first Institution So far did the crafty and avaritious Priests engross the  Devil  's Business that they really seem'd to take the very Trade out of his Hand or as we say of an invading Tradesman that sets up under his Master's Nose  he takes the Bread out of his Mouth    The  Greeks  were the most superstitious of all the  Devil  Worshippers in the World worse than the  Persians  and  Chaldeans  from whom they borrowed all the Fundamentals of their Idolatry and far worse than the  Romans  who were afterwards their Scholars Image and Idol Worship were Essentials in all their Temples which the  Romans  at first rejected with Disdain even  Numa Pompilius  the most devout and superstitious of all the  Romans  despis'd it and many of the most learned of the  Roman  Authors exclaim against it as absurd and ridiculous however they came into it afterwards also  But the  Greeks  I say from their particular Love to Superstition were the first that worshipped the Images of their Gods thus you read of the  Ephesians  having the Image of  Jupiter  which came down from Heaven in like manner they had particular Images in every Temple and Temples almost in every Corner and being the fittest People to be thus imposed upon and deluded the Priests who were equally subtle there as in other Places invented or the Devil directed them to that grossest of all Cheats the Oracles of their Gods to whose Temples they constantly repair'd for Answers in the most difficult and doubtful Cases and the  Romans  took it from them  These Oracles were indeed the  Devil  's Masterpiece for here the Priests and himself juggled together in so notorious a manner that no Contrivance for putting a publick Cheat upon the World ever met with the like Success The  Devil  assisting the Priests gave Answers in the most subtle doubtful and ambiguous Terms imaginable so that they frequently possessed the People with a Belief of the Things predicted being come to pass whereas it was all owing to the Double Entendre of the Answers which left things to be understood any way the Priests thought fit and left the Priests room to suggest a Correspondence between the Oracle and the Event when indeed there was no manner of Similitude no Coherence or any thing like it  History gives several Examples of the ambiguous doubtful Answers of the Oracles and yet so bigotted were the  Greeks  to their Notions of them that on the Day of the great Battle at  Plataea  with the  Persians  they would not give Battle tho' the Enemy was upon them and began to trample down their Infantry with the Horse till they knew the Will of the Gods as they express'd it and had a  full Answer from the Oracle the Soldiers sitting still upon the Ground and letting the Enemies cut them in Pieces But as soon as they had understood that the Oracle had given its Answer and that their Sacrifices for Victory were favourable their Commanders assuring them that the Gods were propitious and that they had a Promise of Victory they immediately rous'd up from their Seats form'd their Battalia or Phalanx and fell on with such Fury that the  Persians  and the other  Greeks  that were confederate with them were utterly overthrown and cut in Pieces  It will not be amiss in order to show the World how great the Powers of religious Infatuations were and how far Mankind may be impos'd upon to give a short Account of but that one Day's Action between the  Grecian  Army under their General  Pausanias  and  Mardonius  Leader of the Army of  Xerxes  the King of  Persia    The  Persian  Army consisted of three hundred thousand  Persians  the Flower of  Xerxes  's Army and fifty thousand  Greeks Thebans Macedonians  and  Thessalians  Auxiliaries or Confederates with  Xerxes  The  Athenians  and  Lacedemonians  consisted of no more than forty thousand  Grecians  but old Soldiers and well arm'd commanded by  Pausanias  to whom they had join'd indeed seventy thousand Auxiliar Militia but these were only raw and unexperienc'd People nor had they any Dependance on them for their Valour or Discipline only for making Excursions plundering and the like  'The  Greeks  had sent to enquire of the Oracle at  Delphos  to know the Success of the War and were answer'd that they should certainly have the Victory provided they fought the Battel upon  Athenian Ground  or in the Plains of  Ceres  and  Proserpina  and made their Prayers to such and such GODS  Demy Gods  and NYMPHS  Excellent  Conjuring and Magick to patch up Religion with  'This Answer of the Oracle was an apparent Cheat for no body knew where this Piece of Ground could be The Plain of  Ceres  was indeed on  Athenian Ground  but then it was not near where the Armies lay and they being inferiour in Force could not chuse their Ground or fight where they pleas'd But there was an old Temple of  Ceres  and  Proserpina  near their Camp and likewise some dedicated Places sacred to those  Nymphs  and  Demy Gods  spoken of upon Mount  Ctihaeron  but then the Land belong'd to the Citizens of  Plataea  and not to the  Athenians  and this perplex'd them much  'While they were in this Uneasiness the  Plataeans  to shew their good will and encourage the Army bestow'd all the Lands which those Temples and dedicated Places stood on and for a large Space round by Deed of Gift on the  Athenians  so to cause them to fight on  Athenian  Ground  'All things being thus clear'd up and the Armies just ready to engage the  Grecian  General caused Sacrifices to the Gods for Victory to be brought to the head of the Troops nor would the  Athenians  stir or strike a Stroke till they were ended and that the Priests gave Signals of the Fortunate Omens The  Persian  Army advanc'd the Horsemen charg'd in upon the foremost Troops the Arrows flew in Clouds and many were slain but 'twas all one the Soldiers sat upon the Ground and would not stir a Foot  'But as soon as  Pausanias  had Notice that the Sacrifices were happily ended and that he found those Tokens in the Entrails of the Beasts which the Superstition of the Age esteemed Fortunate and Signals of Success he immediately caus'd the  Army to raise a Shout and gave the Signal of Battel Upon which the Soldiers suddenly rise up upon their Feet with Acclamations and receiv'd the Charge of the  Barbarians  in such excellent Order and with such undaunted Bravery that notwithstanding the Enemy came pouring in upon them with their Multitudes expecting to bear all down before them yet the  Persians  were repulsed and utterly overthrown and  Mardonius  with above three hundred thousand Men kill'd upon the Spot  What Ecclesiastick Magick was this what Superstition without ground The Sacrifices would have gone on tho' the Armies had engag'd or if not why were they not brought sooner to the Place and how in a few Moments more might the whole Army have been cut in Pieces without Resistance for want of the Ceremony of a timely Sacrifice But such is the Power of Superstition and to such a degree of Possession or Infatuation had the  Devil  by the means of his Instruments the  Magicians  brought Mankind  This I take to be the Meridian of the  Devil  's Influence and when the Magick Diabolical was at its greatest Height The  Romans  were superstitious enough but not so grosly given up and yet the  Grecians  were a wise Nation the  Athenians  were fam'd for Wisdom and Knowledge for Philosophy Art and Science flourish'd among them to a degree beyond all the rest of the World Nay they despis'd the Wisdom of all the World in comparison of their own yet swallow'd up with the Magick of Superstition they were in short bewitch'd by a religious Sorcery and run into Superstition to an excess equal to Madness and Distraction  The  Romans  as I said above follow'd them at the Hells and tho' at first the wisest of their Leaders rejected the Image Worship of the  Greeks  nay  stood out one hundred and seventy Years from  Numa Pompilius  esteeming it absurd and impious to represent things glorious by things base or mean yet  Tarquinius Priscus  following the Usage of the  Greeks  who I say of all the Nations of the World were the most deluded by the  Devil  brought in the Custom of setting up the Images of their Gods in their Temples and in some Ages after this Use of Images came up to such a height and multiplied to such an infinite Number that it was next to impossible to know them one from another but they were oblig'd to write their Names over their Statues and Images and the Numbers of their Gods and DemyGods grew up to such a Multitude that they were oblig'd to marshal them into Regiments and Classes Degrees and Orders and even of them too many to repeat Such as  Dii Consentes Select  Dii Patritii Dii Medii Insigniores Dii Mediorum  or common Gods Terrestial and Coelestial Heroes Gods and DemyGods Nymphs and in a word an infinite Throng of Gods  Happy Art however Infernal and Diabolick that could furnish Gods from the Street to the Capitol nay Dung  il Gods Doorkeeping Gods and SenateHouse Gods  Dii Conscripti  and above all the rest as the Learned  Lactantius  says the Rabble of Gods beatify'd by Men  Epimenides Cretensis  erected in the  Athenian  Plains the famous Altar to the  Dii Ignatii  the Unknown Gods of which St  Paul  took Notice for it remain'd there to his time when he made that fam'd Oration Inimitable for its Eloquence and Beauty of Language as well as Excellence and Strength of Argument when he stood upon  MarsHill  at  Athens  confuting the Wisdom of the Philosophers and perhaps  Magicians    And whence now came all this Ignorance and Superstition but from the early Delusions of the  Devil  carry'd on among Men by the help of this we call  Magick  of  Black Art  and in all its several Compositions that is to say as above  Divining Southsaying Inchantment Whitchcraft Sorcery  and dealing with  Familiar Spirits Necromancy  and the  Devil    These things introduc'd Enthusiasm Enthusiasm brought up Idolatry and then Witchcraft and Magick brought down the Minds of Men to a Meanness fit to be deluded by them  It may not be improper to observe here that the  Black Art  as thus explain'd may be less needful in those Days when the deluded World was more easy to be imposed upon and cheated than now when the World seem to have their Eyes open and require more Artifice to impose upon them with  In the  Grecian  and  Roman  Times the Minds of Men untaught and without the Assistance of Divine Illuminations were easily impos'd upon given up to strong Delusions and to believe Lies they were bigotted by the Priests and by their own Native Superstitions and were easily deluded to worship any Gods every bodies Gods and even as above  Unknown Gods  Happy Ignorance compar'd to our Age who by their Excess of Knowledge and Sense are arriv'd to a degree of Liberty from the Slavery and Bondage of all Religion that esteem themselves wise in having found out a new Happiness for Mankind freeing him from the Chains of Doctrine and Principle triumphing in a State of compleat Atheism and Irreligion and instead of worshipping many Gods save themselves the trouble of Idolatry and worship no God at all  It must be confess'd it has cost the  Devil  some Pains he has employ'd a world of Agents and bestow'd a great deal of Magick to bring this to pass nay in my Opinion it seems that he never  was able to bring it to pass no not by all his Agents and whatever Pains and Expence he had been at but on the contrary it came into his Management by an unforeseen and even to the  Devil  himself an unexpected turn of his Affairs For first it seem'd to be a new Discovery in its very Nature and what Satan had no Notion of for many thousands of Years and I do not find the most Learned in these Matters are agreed yet about it as whether it is immediately from Hell a new Invention of the Place and so introduc'd by the  Devil  as a Favour and Advantage to Mankind or whether the Case is inverted and as Man has in this Practice outsinn'd the  Devil  so he has been the  Devil  's Instructor in it and brought the thing to him as a Projector does a Scheme to the Person whom he would have to manage it for him  Indeed I must do the  Devil  the Justice to say I think it was the latter that it never enter'd into  Satan  's Head as cunning as he is to imagin any thing so gross would go down with the World that tho' it is true he had begun early in setting up himself in the place of God and had gotten himself to be worship'd as a GOD yet he never offer'd to suggest to Mankind that there was no God to be ador'd at all no Supreme Being existing to whom the Homage of the World was due as to its Creator and Preserver  The  Devil  knew the early Principles and whence they were infus'd he knew that it was a Fire kindled with the Life and that could not be extinguish'd but with the same Life that it was the Work of Nature in Man twisted with his Reason and as he thought it impossible to be erac'd and obliterated so he never attempted it Not to believe a God All Hell acknowledg'd the Mighty Truth and the  Devil  himself could never imagine Mankind could be brought to question it  Infernal Spirits Themselves have deify'd  But Devils nor Men the Being of God deny'd  'Till wiser Ages found new ways to Sin  And turn'd the Devil out to let the Atheist in  This Attainment is indeed a new Invention but like our late  SouthSea  Stock it is run up and has gain'd upon Mankind by a general Infatuation and may well be call'd Magick in its very Abstract Nothing indeed but a kind of thinking  rightly call'd  FREE and founded on Schemes of the most refin'd Infidelity could act upon such a System as this What Magick must there be to work up the Mind of Man to a Possibility of receiving such a Principle without Astonishment No God what a Shock it gives to the Soul what a Blow to the reasoning Powers  The secret Trepidation racks the Soul  And while he says No God replies  thou Fool  It must be a most exquisite Piece of Magical Work and Magick in it self must be a most exquisite Art more refin'd and more superior in Wickedness than the most superlative Craft of Hell ever arriv'd to that should raze out the Impressions of a GOD from the Soul of Man where they were first riveted by the very same Hand of Power that created him that could harden the Soul against the Terrors of his Maker and blot out all the Representations of God which the light of Nature and of Reason had printed upon his Mind  It is beyond even the lofty Theme I am upon and as the Power of Magick cannot reach it so it is also beyond me to conceive of it either what Power it is wrought by or from what strange corrupted Fountain it flows I confess I cannot find in my  Heart to charge  Satan  with it for I would not slander the  Devil  nor do I find any Footsteps of it in all the  Devil  's Story or in all the Accounts of his Management in the World I leave it therefore to the Learned Searchers into the Antiquity of these Times to find out if it be possible its Original and tell us from whence it proceeds promising in the mean time that if they will but tell me where it begun I'll take care to give them an Account where it will end and that from very good Authority  The bringing Mankind to deny the Being of their Maker is a thing in it self so surprising so shocking to Nature and to common Sense that it cannot but raise our Curiosity if possible to find out its Original I acknowledge my self to have lost a great deal of Labour in the Search nor have all the Methods I have hitherto taken been able to give me any considerable Light into the Matter I am loth I confess to go to  Satan  himself to enquire about it and so deal with the  Devil  my self while I am exploding the Practice in others Besides I am very doubtful whether if I did he could give me a true or at least a full Account of it for I am under a full Perswasion that it is beyond him that the Original was from the Nature of Man arriv'd by his own Improvement to a height beyond his first Instructor How the Heart of Man became receptive of Wickedness beyond the Power of Hell and Devils to infuse is a Point too curious to dwell upon here we may meet with it again in our way  It may be true and we have good reason to say we find it so that the  Devil  greedily embrac'd the Proposal and like the King of  Spain  when  Columbus  brought him the first News of a new World in  America  offer'd to his Government and adding a new Empire to his Dominiom He whose Ambition  had before grasp'd the whole World in Imagination yet greedily accepted the Discovery how mean soever the Discoverer was Thus  Satan  however outwitted and outsinn'd by the Dexterity of Men being shew'd a way of insulting his Maker his darling Sin and the height of his Ambition which he never thought of before tho' perhaps secretly disdaining to be outshot in his own Bow yet greedily embrac'd the Discovery embarks in the Scheme and prompts the wicked Contrivers to go on with it with the utmost Application  It may be ask'd of me why I will Insist upon this matter in a Treatise of Magick that this relates to the Atheists not to  Magicians  and that by the same Rule all Enthusiasms Heresies and mysterious things in Religion as well as in Science may be rated in the same Class and be call'd by the same Name and so we shall make a Magick of Religion at last  But let a short Answer suffice to this weak Objection All Errors in Religion are not equally Diabolic no nor equally mischievous and as I have said above that this seems to be of an Original deeper than Hell and out of the Reach of the  Devil  so as far as it is a Crime which derives from the Man as an Independent and acting the  Devil  by himself I think it must have the Height of human Imagination and Invention in it and so may be call'd Magical as Magick is a Sicence or Art of doing Superlative Evil  If then it shall be allow'd at least to be as it really is an Extreme of human Wickedness it must have the Essence of Magick in it as Magick is now consider'd and therefore when I mention it in the Title of this Chapter I call it MAGICK  in its Practice and Perfection  What mysterious Power must it be or as 'tis usual to express it what Magick  must there be in it that Mankind can be harden'd to a Pitch capable of denying the POWER that made them capable of arguing against the Reality of that Being which gave them Being  Nor does the Magick consist in the Fact neither do I lay the Stress of it there or upon the Sin against Reason against common Sense the Ingratitude to their Maker the open Insult of Heaven the Venture of provoking that  Being  whose Power it insults and many other things of like Importance these are things the People I am talking to and the Age I am talking in can ridicule and make a Jest of and laugh at the mention of them not shall I dwell upon them the Divines are equal to this Task and their proper Work it is I leave it with them  But my Enquiry looks another way and there the Magick discovers it self  viz  by what strange Influence by what secret Wonder in Nature it is brought about that Men who say they have Souls that have a Capacity of reasoning and judging and whose  universal Passion  is to be vain of that Judgment proud of their reasoning Powers and of their being capable of censuring the Defects of others that These should ever be capable of being thus impos'd upon of receiving such a Notion and even of desiring it should be true This is indeed astonishing and here I confess there must be some  Magick  some secret prevailing Artifice whether of the  Devil  or of what else who can tell Here must be some Wheels and Springs able when set a going to give a Progression to the whole Movement and here must be some secret Hand turning those Wheels and Springs be it Internal External or Infernal I leave it as I find it only I think as I thought before my Judgment dictates to me that the  Devil  is not in the Plot that he had no hand in it at least not at first what he may have  done since I know nothing of yet and I do not see how I shall at least not till I have made farther Inquiry  In looking into this Absurdity which so many Men of Parts and who scorn Absurdities in other things are pleas'd to come into I cannot but observe how busy they are how many Arts and Tricks truly Magical do they find out to reason themselves into the belief of that horrid Inconsistency What subterfuges do they fly to what Arguments weak as they are do they use and how do they cleave and cling about them loading every Word that can be offer'd against them with innumerable Cavils and with the most apparent Sophistry  One sort will have a God of one kind One of another The  Sceptick  forms the Notion of a God in his Mind but strips him of all his governing Power divests him of Knowledge and Wisdom Holyness and Justice and all those glorious Attributes for which he is worthy to be ador'd and which make him justly the Object of our Homage and of our Affection too  The  Deist  strips him of the very constituting Part of the Deity and brings him down to a Level with our Reasoning divesting him of all Governing Protecting and Preserving Providence and particularly of all Resentment against the vilest Offences robbing him of the Power of Rewards and Punishments and making him so good so kind and gracious that they do not leave him room to be Just or allow him any Resentment let the cases be what they will  The  Atheist  outgoes them all and not able indeed to reconcile their Notions to common Sense much less to reason himself into their Opinions audaciously shuts his Eyes against Reason and Sense also and tells you there is NO GOD at all  Now Magick puts an end to all this Difficulty for by consulting the dark Oracle and entring a little into the Secrets of the  sacred Science  as they wickedly tell you it is they come out transform'd into a new kind of Species they tell you that they are arriv'd to a compleat Knowledge of the Eternal Mysteries that GOD is nothing but the Sum of human Desires the Ecstasy of an exalted Spirit carry'd up into the Regions of eternal Calm and Quiet where the Soul is in Raptures of Joy and Love This they resolve by the Light of the refin'd sublime Judgment to be the Perfection of Happiness and that is  God Amor  DEUS  est  JUPITER  quodcunque cupis    They tell your farther to descend to the Personality of a GOD is talking wildly and immethodically and what is inconsistent with Nature that GOD is a Quality rather than a  Being  that cannot be describ'd by Words any more than it can be limited by Space that the supreme Essence is an inconceiveable Spirit of Light and Glory and the Soul receives an assimulating Light and Knowledge even by the Contemplation of it by the Rays of a communicable Effulgence so that having been once illuminated it continues enjoying a full Lustre of eminent Glory for ever after  This unintelligible Stuff is all Magick to me and I believe we may truly say it is so to us all it is some of the Cant of the Trade the Terms of Art in that Profession and if this be the Discovery that Magick makes to the Mind the Magicians will have small cause to boast of their Improvement I presume it shall leave the Mind darker than it finds it  Now that this makes room for  Atheism  or  Deism  or  Polytheism  in the Mind it is very evident for next to the denying the divine Being our entertaining false and corrupt Notions unworthy of  God and of the reasoning human Soul are fatal to Religion  Yet what Impressions have these things made upon some of the politest Men in this Age who pretending to extirpate all the Notions of Religion in their Souls begin it with denying the Being of the God that evidently made them if you pretend to argue from Reason from Nature from visible Things to invisible they reject it all and call for Demonstration they will have Heaven measur'd Mathematically and Geographically as it were by Scale and Compass and will judge of things invisible according to  Gunter  they will allow of nothing but what they can see with their Eyes and feel with their Hands nor will they believe any such thing as an Incomprehensible They will have all Heaven resolv'd into Nature all Religion into Reason and all God into Philosophy They are not thus difficult in other things less Evidence will serve them in Crime and they will make shift with the weakest Arguments in the World to perswade themselves into the Lawfulness and Justice of the vilest things that they allow the Practice of so partial are they to their corrupt Inclinations so prejudic'd against every thing that looks like a superior and legal Restraint to their Vices is not this justly call'd  Magick  is it not with the utmost Propriety brought into a System of  Magick  is it not really a  Black Art  a Piece of Conjuration and Witchcraft is it not all Necromancy and the  Devil  When  Human Wit  in search of things Divine  Would  Reason's Light  with Revelation  join  Expect to have  Almighty Being  made known  By  the same Light  by which we know  our own  Creating  by  Created  would explain  And Demonstration of  first Powers  obtain  How does  the wild Philosophy  confess  Its Weakness Ignorance and  Emptyness  How do the Naturalists and  SO SO  's Dream  When gravely they present the  Sacred Scheme  Lay down  the Draught  draw out the  Magick Plan  A  selfderiving  World a  selfcreating  Man  And would a  Nature  void of  GOD  explain  Strange how when Men are once  of Crime possess'd  Their  reasoning Faculties  are all suppress'd  If of  Religion  they some Hints desire  What  Proofs  what  Demonstrations  they require  What  Difficulties  ere they can submit  What  reasoning Scruples  raise what  turns of Wit  To shift the strong Conviction from the Mind  As if  Religion  all to Sense  confin'd  Should every  School Distinction  undergo  And Rules  of Faith  to Rules  of Reason  bow  But if to  harden'd Crime  they but encline  In vain  their reasoning Light  pretends to shine  The wildest Notions  blindly entertain  Reason  and  Nature  struggle but all in vain  Error  like  Mother's Milk  they swallow down  And  by their Choice  make every Crime  their own    The deadly poisonous Draught  drink freely  in  And ask no  reasoning Questions  when  they Sin    Take Crime  by Lump  howe'er  absurd  and  gross  And  wed Mistakes  for  better  or for  worse    So  pedling Merchants  as their Stocks encrease  Turn  Wholesalemen  and only trade  by th' Piece    The bringing Mankind then into these Absurdities I say is the height of Magick 'tis making them capable of entertaining Atheistic Notions and on Pretence of reasoning to receive Principles inconsistent with Reason and because things Divine are in some Particulars incomprehensible they run into Notions neither comprehensible or rational  This is infinitely beyond all the Enthusiasm and religious Frenzy in the World 'tis brought about by a Possession a meer Rapture of the Imagination which in a word forms in the Mind a new Scheme of Nature new Notions of  Being  of Life of Motion of past present and future nay they tell you as much they tell you the common Conceptions of things are only calculated to keep the World blind and dark that wrap'd up in their own Ignorance they may be easy  That if by a supernatural Light and by the Study of sacred Science that is to say of Magick a few of the more enlightned part of Mankind have attain'd to a clearer View of things and that View or Knowledge is communicated to the Souls of those Few by a sublime Influence yet it is not so in the main that the rest of the World understand nothing of it and that Mankind remain blind and ignorant for want meerly of Application to and Study of a true Knowledge  These are the Things which they tell us of themselves and which they talk in a kind of Cant particular to their own sort representing themselves as a kind of angelick People that live above the rest of the World and that act in a higher Sphere are endow'd with superior Light that live beyond the ordinary Rate of their FellowCreatures What Reality there is in these things what Attainments they have and how they have exercised them we shall discover more plainly when we look a little into the rest of it when we see what angelick  things they do and in what manner they exercise their extraordinary Faculties whether they appear to be Illuminations from Heaven or Delusions of Hell whether Emanations of the Realms of Light or Mists and Vapours from the Regions of Darkness in a word whether they are Revelations and Inspiration from the good Spirit above or Enthusiasms Witchcraft and Sorcery prompted and assisted by the  Devil    How lowpriz'd are all their Undertakings how mean and contemptible the Methods they take to exert these noble and superior Faculties How do they practise upon Mankind by Conjurations Spells and Enchantments by the most pitiful and scandalous Delusions pretending to divine and superior Knowledge One part of their Performances consists in juggling and slight of Hand another part in Fraud and Falshood another in the most ignorant Pretences and the last and as I may say the only real Part in a meer Necromancy and Dealing with familiar Spirits  In their Operations were their Acquirements Divine was their Power from Heaven were the extraordinary Accomplishments which they boast of truly and as they say Seraphick and Heavenly it would appear in this that like their heavenly Original they would be exerted in doing good they would be shewn in acts of Charity of Beneficence to Mankind moving the World to reform and in a word in bringing a Glory to Religion and to every laudable thing whereas on the contrary we see the Magicians of the latter Ages of the World are and always have been employed in the extreme of Wickedness in the blackest Crimes in protecting and encouraging the worst and most devilish Practices in the World prompting confederated Mischiefs joyning in with Murder Treason Assassination and all manner of wicked things  Thus they tell us of the  Magicians  among the  Germans  who fomented the Rebellion of those Enthusiasts call  Anabaptists  which brought so many thousands to their Grave by War and Treason Some will tell us that Count  Wallestine  the Great General under the Emperor  Ferdinand  II and who fought the great Battel of  Lutzen  against the King of  Sweden  us'd Magick and that several of the  German  Officers had Charms and Spells about them to render them invulnerable so that no Sword would cut them no Bullets wound them but that they were deluded by the  Magicians  for that many of them were found among the Slain with Charms hanging about their Necks and that  Wallenstine  himself notwithstanding his Magick Art was overthrown and shamefully beaten by the  Swedes  in that great Battel and was himself afterwards assassinated and kill'd by an  Irish  Captain in the Castle of  Egra  in  Bohemia  though surrounded with his Guards  Many Instances have been given and History is full of them where the Pretenders to this Art have been abandon'd to Ruin either deluded by the Daemon they trusted or through the real Deficiency of the Art it self the latter of which I insist upon has been chiefly the Reason of it for what Operation could they expect from the help of Magick to counteract the Determinations of Providence even  Balaam  himself could declare it thus  Surely there is no Enchantment against  JACOB  neither is there any Divination against  ISRAEL Numb xxiii  CHAP II  The Scene chang'd That as the  Devil  acted at First with his  Black Art  without the  Magicians  so the  Magicians  seem to carry it on now without the  Devil    HItherto I have made the  Devil  the Aggressor in all the Transactions between himself and Mankind but now we must turn the Tables for  whether it be  that finding things go on currently and to his Mind he only sits still and looks on like an Engineer who has with infinite Art and great Fatigue form'd a new Machine then sets it at Work and seeing it perform according to Expectation sits down with Satisfaction and lets it go round of it self Or whether the Nature of Man corrupt and prompt to all the foolish and foul things the  Devil  could put into his Head does really run on faster than the  Devil  can drive him This as a Doubt which either Philosophy or Divinity have not yet resolv'd I must leave it to Time and Experience to explain  That thus it is the Fact is plain if the  Black  or Diabolick  Art  was at first a Machine of the  Devil  or let it be whose it will it works now of it self it performs to the  Devil  's Satisfaction he has little to do but to sit still and see the Wheels go round  Nay we may say the Scholars teach the Master the Magician seems to guide nay to command the  Devil  whose Art it is that he professes and according to the Lines in my Title  The obsequious Devil attends the Sorcerer's Spell  The Mill turns round the Horse who first turns round the Mill  'Tis worth observing here how remarkable the Turn is that seems to be given to the working of these Infernal Machines At first the  Devil  had some Difficulty with Mankind was oblig'd to act with great Craft and Subtilty to make his Acquaintance among them as I have observ'd at large after this he got the Ascendant to such a degree that he as the  Devil  you know is apt to encroach where he finds room for it set himself up for a Guide then a Governor then a God was first follow'd as a Director or Adviser next obey'd and submitted to as a Governor and Commander and then  for he never rests  worshipp'd as a God which no doubt was his first and of Necessity must be his highest Aim and Ambition  But now by we know not what Fate Mankind seems to have got the better of him instead of being waited upon in Form and humbly expected as in his first Appearances instead of being  Pawwa'd  and great Assemblies and Ceremonies us'd to obtain an Audience of him he comes now at every old Woman's Call and upon the most trifling Occasion instead of being a Counsellor or an Adviser much less a Governor now he's a meer Errand Boy runs and goes will do any Drudgery work like a Horse fetch and carry like a Dog dig Ditches carry Burthens build Churches or any thing the Priests and the Conjurers bid him do witness  NewMarket Heath Stonehenge Crowland Abbey  and a thousand more things which to be sure the  Devil  did because we don't know how else they could be done  The  Magicians  were formerly the  Devil  's Servants but now they are his Masters and that to such a degree that 'tis but drawing a Circle casting a few Figures muttering a little  Arabick  and up comes the  Devil  as readily as the Drawer at a Tavern with a  d'ye call Sir  or like a  Scots Caude  with  What's your Honour's Wull Sir  Nay and as the learned in the Art say  He must come he can't help it  Then as to tempting he's quite out of Doors And I think as the old Parliament did by the Bishops we may e'en  vote him useless  In a word there's no manner of Occasion for him Mankind are as forward as he can wish and desire of them Nay some cunning Men tell us we sin faster than the  Devil  can keep Pace with us as witness the late witty and moderately wicked Lady who bless'd her Stars that the  Devil  never tempted her to any thing he understood himself better for she knew well enough how to sin without him and that it would be losing his time to talk to her  Likewise our happy Friend the much honoured Sir  H  who values himself upon this particular Accomplishment that he is able to SIN  like a Gentleman  nay he merits much from Satan in that if he may be believed when he speaks the worst of himself he is also able to teach him the  Devil  to be more refinedly wicked than he is This Sir  H  certainly gives the  Devil  very little Trouble about him and tho' I don't hear that the old Gentleman is yet come to School to the Baronet yet as the Baronet don't come to learn of him so he the  Devil  need not come to teach him for that he is certainly as well accomplished in the horrid Art as the  Devil  can make him  The Age we live in  fruitful in Black Arts  whether in that which by way of Eminence we call  Black Art  or no is yet undetermined affords us many I dare not say bright Examples of flaming Wickedness 'Tis no new thing to hear the Right Honourable my Lord tho' his Lordship is known to be no Necromancer neither rate himself above the low mechanick poorheaded Rabble as he justly calls them who dare be  Devils  but don't  understand it have Impudence enough but not a Genius to be truly flagrant It is indeed a modern Accomplishment and requires some Additions of Art and Practice to be able to sin like a Lord And tho' the great Man just now mentioned may perhaps have reason to exalt his own Acquirement and to boast of accumulated Crime insomuch that he would take it for an Affront if the  Devil  should pretend to prompt him and that perhaps Satan who understands good Breeding has had more Manners than to disturb his Lordship that way seeing him go on so happily without him yet it may be acknowledged the watchful Seraph does find a little Business sometimes among some of his Lordship's Imitators being at some happy Pains to form them as the Moderns express it and make them as finish'd Devils of Quality as his Lordship so that we may be satisfied there is no great Fear we shall want a Succession of human Infernals no not among Men of Rank  Wonder not then that the  Devil  growing so much out of Business in the World and Men growing as I said such Proficients in the Science of the Abominables is in proportion humble as to his Conduct and allows himself to be the obedient Servant of every Stargazer and Figurecaster that he comes when he is called goes when he is sent nay sometimes comes before he is called and is the most diligent  Devil  imaginable He would be very ungrateful it must be allowed if he should not where the Age is so obliging to him but besides that he finds it for his Interest too and he is too cunning not to push his Game whereever it will go  I have heard of a Magician that when the  Devil  and he had made a Bargain that he should always come when he was called that is to say that whenever the Magician drew such and such Circles and made such and such Figures and then called him  by Name that then he should be sure to appear had a mind to try whether the Devil would be honest to him or no and for making this Experiment performed all his Exercises as I may call them by himself and when he had no manner of Occasion for it However the punctual  Devil  kept his Word and came to a Tittle which the Necromancer was mightily pleased with After this he thought he might make a little Game with the  Devil  so he calls him up again and when he came the Spirit ask'd him what was the Business he told him he had no Business only called him for his Company and to be better acquainted Very well says Satan or  Beelzebub  or who you will call him for I don't remember that he knew what his Name was but it seems the patient  Devil  answer'd him 'Twas very well and shewed no manner of Resentment but after some Conversation left him again very quietly  The foolish Fellow it seems went on with the Sport making a Fool of the  Devil  so often and so long 'till at last the  Devil  asking him as before what he called him up for and he telling him he had no Business but only that he liked his Conversation and called him up for the sake of his Company Very well says the  Devil  not at all displeased I am glad to hear it then go along with me and you shall have enough of my Company without giving me the Trouble to come so far and with that the Conjurer felt himself lifted up in the Air a little from the Ground which made him cry out horribly  I don't know what Argument and Entreaties he used so as to move Compassion in him that is known not to be furnished with any thing of that kind but perhaps the  Devil  was not quite ready for him and knew that he might do him more Service in the Station he was newly entred  into so it seems he did not take him quite away that time However it was the Magician was effectually cured of trying Experiments and never offer'd to make a Jest of the  Devil  any more  If I should tell you the Name of this bold Spark of a Conjurer and that he lived not far off of one of our  Temples  you would perhaps wonder at the Man who indeed no body ever took to have Wit enough to banter the  Devil  but I must not bring my Characters too near home besides who knows but the  Devil  may charge me with discovering his Secrets and betraying Conversation so I say no more If any body finds me out and guesses at the Man by the Story I shall be only sorry for the Person not for the Picture  As I was musing of these things the other day and having a great many merry Stories of this sort in my Budget was considering which was fit to be told and which not it came into my Thoughts how travelling some time since from  Daventry  towards  Leicester  I met on the Road with a Countryman of whom being my self a Stranger to the Road I asked the Way to  Northampton  the Countryman told me but with a Tone of Melancholy and Dejection that he was going to  Northampton  and if I pleased and I would not override him he would show me the Way  I was very glad of his offer'd Service and so suiting my Pace to his for he had but a very poor Horse we went on together I still perceived the Man to be pensive and sad spoke little and never but when I asked him some Question which oblig'd him to an Answer often sigh'd and lifted up his Hands and sometimes his Eyes and minded his Way so little that if his Horse had not been more sagacious than he the Man would have run against a Post or into a Ditch and two or three times he did get into a Hole or some other ill Place in the  Way which he might have shunn'd Countryman says I what's the matter with you and so we begun the short Discourse as follows  Countryman  Why Sir  Author  Why you don't seem to mind your Feet or your Horse's Feet you may lead me to  Northampton  but I think you want somebody to lead you too or else you will be in a Ditch  Com  I care not much indeed where I go or what becomes of me  Au  So I think truly why if you were in some Roads that I know you would have found a Stable for your Horse by this time  Com  A Stable for my Horse what in a Ditch I suppose  Au  Yes I mean so indeed you'll be but an odd Guide to me if you can't keep your self out of Harmsway  Com  As I said before I care not what becomes of me but however Master I'll guide you well enough the Way to  Northampton  And * then  * NB  Here he stopt and fetch'd a Sigh and I thought I saw Tears stand in his Eyes  Au  And then what then what will you do with your self then  Com  Nay I don't know not I hang my self I think I don't know any thing I can do better  Au  Pr'ythee Friend what's the matter is it such a Secret you dare not tell it I hope you have not committed Murther  Co m  No no Murther I have committed neither Murther nor Robbery 'tis no such great matter neither  Au  No great matter and yet talk of hanging your self  Com  It is a great matter to me tho' it may be it would be nothing in the Eyes of others  Au  Well Friend if it be not too much a Secret let me ask you what it is perhaps I may help you  Com  Ay you or fifty more may ask me but I am a Fool if I tell you  Au  Well Countryman if it be a Secret pray keep it to your self I don't desire to know any of your Affairs  Com  Nay 'tis no great Secret neither and yet 'tis a Secret too or else I should not have gone to  Northampton  today  Au  You're a merry Fellow Countryman what a Secret and no Secret that's a Secret indeed of it self I don't understand you  Com  Why Master if you must have it you must the matter is this I am a Cuckold and my Wife's a Whore  that's no Secret  But I can't tell who does it for me  that's a Secret  and that's what I want to find out so there's  the Secret  and  no Secret  made out at once An't I right now Master  Au  Poor Man I think thou hast made it out indeed but why so melancholy at it Sure you would not hang your self to find it out  Com  No Master not to find it out but I am fit to hang my self because I can't find it out Would not any Man hang himself to be a Cuckold and can't find out the Man  Au  And what if you did find out the Man what would you be the better for that unless you could prevent it  Com  O I'd prevent it I warrant ye I would not hang my self I assure you but I'd hang the Dog I'd soon prevent their whoring  Au  Well but Countryman that's wrong again that has the Gallows at the end of it and that would be but poor Work for you to bring your self to the  Devil  because your Wife's a Whore  Com  Nay I don't care where I go rather than be a Cuckold  Au  Is that such a frightful thing to you would you commit Murther and be hang'd rather than be a Cuckold  Com  Why Master what must I do  Au  Do Be contented if you can't help it as many an honest Man is forc'd to do  Com  No no that won't do I can't be contented I must and will find it out  Au  Well but do you think hanging your self will discover it to you or being hang'd for Murther about it d'ye think you shall know the Secret when you're hang'd  Com  No doubt of it  Au  Well but what if you did  Com  Did why d'ye think I could not get Leave to come again and plague them  Au  Who do you think could give you Leave As for Heaven I suppose you don't think much about that especially upon the foot you speak of I mean Murther and as for the  Devil  I don't think he would part with you if he once had you fast so I would not have you depend upon it too much  Com  Well but the Devil it may be would tell me who 'tis  Au  And what would you be the better if he did  Com  Why I would get him to come and plague them a little and that would do as well another way for I am resolved they shall have no Rest  Au  You are a terrible revengeful Fellow that you would be content to go to the  Devil  to be revenged of the Man that cuckolds you  Com  And of the Whore too you should have put that in Master  Au  I wonder indeed you han't been reveng'd of her already considering your furious Spirit why  you are a Madman I should be afraid you should murther your Wife  Com  Ay Master she's afraid o' that too but she has been too cunning for me for she is run for it and got out of my Clutches  Au  She's in the right of it can you blame her  Com  Ay but she has robb'd me too  Au  Robb'd you ay what could you expect why if you would have murther'd her she must have been a Fool to have staid and if she was forced to fly you could not think she would go away empty could you  Com  Well I will find them out if they are above Ground  Au  If you can you mean but pray are they gone together  Com  Nay if I knew that then I should know who the Rogue is which is one of the main things I want to be informed of  Au  And which you would be content to go to the  Devil  to discover  Co m  If I was sure he or any one else could but tell me I didn't care where I went  Au  Why do you think if the  Devil  did know that he would tell you  Com  Why not Master  Au  Why do you think the  Devil  is more your Friend than theirs do you think he cares how many Whores and Cuckolds there are  Com  Nay that's true indeed I did not think of that but however I shall be informed where I am going whether the  Devil  knows any thing of it or no and if he does  Au  What then what if he does  Com  Why then I believe I shall get it out of him  Au  What d'ye mean out of the  Devil  why where are you going  Com  To one of his Acquaintance Master that will tell me I dare say for a Piece of Money and tho' the Jade han't left me a Shirt to my Back I have borrow'd a little Money for this Work and I will have it out if Money will do it  Au  What do you mean Countryman are you really going to the  Devil  Com  Why to tell you the Truth I am going to a Cunning Man Master hard by  Northampton  that I am told will discover it all to me  Au  Well but do you call that going to the  Devil  Com  Yes certainly for he deals with the  Devil  or else he could never do such strange things  Au  What strange things does he do  Com  Why he can cast a Figure tell Folks where their lost Cattle are tell who robs them and oftentimes helps them to get their Goods again  Au  And so you think he can tell who has cuckolded you don't you  Com  To be sure he can Master why should not he tell one thing as well as another  Au  He'll take your Money to be sure that's all you can be sure of I tell thee Countryman 'tis all a Cheat they are only Rogues and Jugglers they know nothing of the matter  Com  Why that can't be Master they say he will shew me the Man's Face in a Lookingglass  Au  And what if he does shew you a Man's Face and you don't know him where are you then  Com  Nay that's none of his Fault  Au  'Twill be his Fault to put a Cheat upon you and shew you a Face you don't know pretending that's the Man and you ne'er the wiser  Com  Well but he will make me dream of the Man and see him in my Sleep  Au  Very well and so if you chance to dream of an honest Man you will go and murther him will you for making you a Cuckold I tell you your Cunning  Man is a Cheat he no more deals with the  Devil  than you do  Com  Well then I'll go to  Oundle  there's a Man that deals in Magick and he'll raise the  Devil  for me if I desire it and I shall see him and talk with him my self  Au  And you believe it do you  Com  I shall believe it sure when I see it shan't I why d'ye think I won't believe my own Eyes  Au  Why do you know the  Devil  when you see him how will you be sure 'tis the  Devil  Com  I shall know him by his cloven Foot shan't I Master  Au  I believe not did you ever see the  Devil  in your Life  Com  No not I but I have heard of a great many that have why is that such a strange thing Master  Au  'Tis such a strange thing that I don't believe one Word of it  Com  What don't you believe that a Magician can raise the  Devil  Au  I do not know Countryman but the  Devil  may be called up upon extraordinary Occasions but hardly by your threehalfpenny Conjurer nor upon such a Business as yours is  Com  Why won't the  Devil  come when he is called why the Magician at  Oundle  can make him come they say whether he will or no if he does but draw a Circle and turn round five times in it the  Devil  can't help appearing no more than if we said the Lord's Prayer backward  Au  Why will he come if we say our Prayers backward  Com  Ay certainly Master Why you don't doubt that d'ye  Au  Nay I don't say I doubt it but did you ever try it your self  Com  No I never try'd it that's true but I have heard an old Woman at  Dav'ntry  used to raise the  Devil  that Way very often  Au  I wonder you should not try it when you have such Occasion to talk with him  Com  Ay I want to talk with him that I do but I dare not talk with him by my self neither  Au  Why not you know well enough what to say to him  Com  Ay that's true but I don't know how to manage him as they do they are used to him 'tis their Trade to deal between him and us  Au  But it would save you the Charges and I fancy the  Devil  and you are no Strangers  Com  What d'ye mean Master I never saw him in my Life  Au  Well if you ha'nt been in his Company I dare say he has been in yours  Com  Why so Master  Au  You would never talk of hanging your self and of being hanged for Murther so familiarly as you do if he had not been at work with you  Com  Why I am half mad Sir What would you have me do I must be revenged on 'em  Au  Ay I told you the  Devil  had been with you 'tis he makes you talk of Revenge that's all the  Devil  and ends in Damnation for if he is a Spirit which waits to devour and that does all he can to destroy us we may very well think all evil Motions come from him  Com  I don't understand those things Master not I but I am sure the  Devil  has had nothing to do with me either in that or any thing else  Au  I tell thee honest Friend thou doest not know when the  Devil  is working in thee and when not all such horrid Thoughts as thou hast had about Selfmurther Revenge and doing Mischief to others must be from the  Devil    Com  Well Master let's talk no more of that my Head runs another way at present  Au  Why will you really go to enquire of the  Devil  about who has made you a Cuckold  Com  No not to the  Devil  I only go to the Cunning Man  Au  Yes and to the Conjurer at  Oundle  you say and he can raise the  Devil  it seems  Com  Well then he deals with the  Devil  not I  Au  And do you think as I said before the  Devil  would befriend you so far as to hinder your Wife's Wickedness do think he would not rather make her wickeder than she is  Com  Nay that's true but however I'd try what I can do I am resolv'd I'll go to him  When I found he was so positive I bad him e'en go and try the Experiment but depend upon it said I the  Devil  won't betray the Secret to you he is too much o' t'other Side  By this time we were come to  Queen  's  Cross  a little of this side  Northampton  and seeing the Town from the Hill I offer'd to go on faster seeing I knew the Way was before me but he bespoke me to keep him Company for Master says he if you lye in the Town all Night I'll certainly come and tell you what the  cunning Man  says to me  I was not unwilling to hear the Result of the Story but was particularly curious to hear what the Magician at  Oundle  could do so I resolved to stay at  Northampton  that Night and we kept Company together to the Town When we came to the Town I put up at the  George Inn  and thought he would have gone in with me but when we came to the Door he bad me Goodby for the present for the Cunning Man he said liv'd two Miles out of the Town and he would talk with him and come to me at Night  I went into my Inn and staid there all Night but heard no more of my poor Cuckold the Countryman all that Evening The next Morning I was indisposed which made me stay longer at the Inn than I intended and indeed was obliged to stay there all that Day and Night too but still I had no News of my Countryman which made me a little chagreen but at last he came back again and comes to me but not 'till the next Day about eleven aClock  Then as I had been waiting before very patiently I began and spoke a little angrily What's the Business now says I what's the matter with you that you dodge about so  O Sir says he let me come in and I'll tell you the strangest things  Well come in then  says I  and sit down I thought you had been lost or had forgot your Promise So he came in and we begun another short Discourse as follows  Com  O Master I have had a hard Night's Work on't  Au  What do you mean of a Night's Work where have you been  Com  Why first Master I went to my cunning Man and gave him a Shilling which it seems he takes before he will speak a Word  Au  Ay ay they are in the right 'tis the only thing I can call them cunning Men for  Com  Why are they cunning in that  Au  Because they know if they did not take the Money beforehand no body would give it them afterwards because they can tell nothing nor say any thing to the purpose  Com  Well I gave him the Shilling he demanded Half a Crown but I told him I was a poor Man and so he condescended in Charity to take a Shilling  Au  That is to say he saw there was no more to be had so he took what he could get and so they all do But come what did he do for it what did he tell thee  Com  O he examined me very strictly I assure you  Au  Examine you about what  Com  Why how long my Wife had been gone what she carried with her what aClock she went at what file said at parting and took every thing down in Figures  Au  Very well this was all Grimace to put a Countenance upon things  Com  Then he bid me hold my Tongue and he fell to making Figures and mutt'ring to himself and on a sudden he starts up Well says he I find your Wife is gone away and that you beat her very severely before she went Now I could not deny that Part Master because I knew it was true but how should he know that Master if he wan't a cunning Man  Au  Well enough when he had examined you so strictly before in all the Particulars he might easily guess you had used her hardly by the Rage you were in when you came to him and when you talk'd of hanging your self and murthering her he might easily judge that you had talked the same to her which had frighted the Woman and she was run away for fear of you there's no great cunning in all that I was a going to say so to you my self once for I really thought of it before  Com  Why then you are as much a cunning Man as he  Au  Well what else did he say to you  Com  Nothing to the purpose only to vex me and make me mad  Au  Nay that he could not do for I verily think you were mad before but what was it come tell me  Com  Why Master he fell to scribbling and scrawling again upon a Piece of Paper and then he rises and walks up and down and round and round as I thought he made Circles three or four times and talk'd to himself all the while  Au  Well and that frighted you I warrant you did not you think he was going to raise the  Devil  Com  Why you know every thing Master aforehand I think you are as cunning as he I was so frighted I trembled like an Aspen Leaf Master  Au  Why didn't you say you wanted to see the  Devil  to tell you all  Com  Ay that's true Master but I was deadly fraid for all that especially when I thought he was just a coming  Au  Well and how then what came of it  Com  Came on it why Master the Man's a Rogue a meer Cheat he had got my Money and when all come to all he told me nothing at least nothing that signified any thing to me  Au  Well but what was it for I find he told you something tho' you don't like it did he bid you go home and be quiet and easie and not trouble your self about it  Com  Hang him Rogue when he had made all his Turns and his Circles and said all his Witchcraft over to himself he sits down and calls me to him and very civilly bad me sit down and begun his ugly Story  Au  I find he has not pleased ye I really fancy the Man has given thee good honest Advice and bid thee go home and mind thy Business and be easie did not I say the same to thee  Com  I'll tell it you all Master if you'll have Patience he's a Rogue a Rogue Master I told you he would have my Money beforehand and so he had or he should never ha' had a Farthing and he knew that well enough  Au  No no he knew Folks never pay when they don't like the Story but go on what did he say  Com  Why as grave as a Judge he takes me by the Hand felt my Pulse holding his conjuring Paper in t'other Hand all the while Heark thee Friend says he I have calculated the Times and the Seasons I have brought your Names in a direct Opposition I have done every thing to satisfy you that can be done and all my Numbers and Accounts agree and this is the Sum of your Case You are a poor honest fretful passionate Fellow that stands here on one Side and then he shewed me his damned Figures and Crosses and Circles on one side and here's your poor Wise a t'other side says he and then he shewed me his Figures again she has anger'd you and scolded at you for your ill Usage of her and you have fallen upon her and beaten her unmercifully and threaten'd to murther her and she is run away for fear of it and now you call her Whore and come to me to tell you who has made a Cuckold of you  Au  And did the Man say all this to you Friend  Com  Yes Master and a great deal more like a Rogue as he is He a cunning Man he's a Blockhead why I knew all that before  Au  Ay and he might easily gather it from your Discourse  Com  No Master that he could not I'm sure  Au  Well then you'll make him a cunning Man indeed at the same time that you call him a Blockhead and a Fool I tell you I gather'd as much before from you and you can't help it you are too full of your own Story But go on what did he say then  Com  Why then he fell to preaching and giving me Advice Go home Friend says the Toad and be easie and quiet and tell your Friends you are  sorry you have been in such a Heat and that you hope your Wife will come home again for you won't do her any Hurt and then your Neighbours will tell her and she'll come lovingly again to you For I tell thee Friend says he thou art in the Wrong the poor Woman is no Whore I can show it you in black and white here and then he pointed to his cursed Conjuring Paper she's a very honest Woman thou hast only a Whymsie come in thy Head because she is gone I tell thee thou art no Cuckold go home and be quiet  Au  And did he say all this to thee  Com  Yes to be sure Master and a great deal more such Stuff what should I be in such a Passion with him for else  Au  Upon my Word Friend whether he be a cunning Man or no that I have nothing to say to he may make thee believe so that's for his Advantage but o'my Conscience I think he's a wise Man and an honest Man and I would advise thee to follow his Counsel for I do tell thee I firmly believe 'tis thy Case to a Tittle and I tell thee thy whole Discourse discover'd it he might have said it all without his Figures and Circles that was done to amuse you but 'tis plain from all you have said that's thy very Case  Com  Ay ay Master 'tis no matter for that let him be as cunning and as wise as he will I have had another guess Account of it and better Advice since for I have been at  Oundle  Master since that and there I have met with a cunning Man indeed  Au  Why have you really been consulting with the  Devil  then  Com  I believe I have indeed  Au  Nay then 'tis like you have had good Advice indeed mayn't a body know what you have met with there too  Com  Truly Master I don't know whether I can tell it you or no for I have been frighted out of my Wits I'm sure if my Hat had been on my Hair would have lifted it off tho' I had had a good Basket of Apples upon my Head  Au  Come let me hear it however as well as you can  Com  Why Master when I came to the Man's House 'tis within two Mile of  Oundle  I think or thereabout it was almost dark and that made it the worse I knock'd at the Door and out came a tall black frightful old Man I begun to be frighted at the very first Sight for I thought it had been the  Devil  was come before I ask'd for him  Au  And are you sure it was not  Com  Yes I think he was not the  Devil  for he spoke very civilly to me and when I ask'd him if he was the cunning Man he smil'd and bad me come in so he carry'd me into a large Room which had but one dim burning Candle in it and I trembl'd every Inch of me for I thought the Candle burnt blue as soon as I look'd at it  Au  Very well so you thought you were come into good Company did not you  Com  Indeed I wish'd my self out of the House again that I did but the old Gentleman whistled and in came a young Fellow that look'd like a Servant and he bad him go snuff the Candle and bring in another and that comforted me a little then he sat him down in a great ElbowChair with a little Table before it and upon the Table was a great many Books and a Pen and Ink and Paper Come Friend says he let me know thy Business for tho' I am none of those ignorant Fellows you call Cunning Men yet perhaps I may tell you what you want to know upon a better foot  Au  Well he begun pretty high what could he pretend to  Com  I reply'd Sir I was told you was one that dealt in secret things that understood the  Black Art  and those we call Cunning Men if I am mistaken I am very sorry and so made as if I would go away again but he stopp'd me and said Look you Friend I am none of those Fellows you call cunning Men I look upon them to be all Cheats my Practice is all Divine of a superior Nature I study things in a higher Sphere I deal in the Mysteries of an invisible World and converse with the World of Spirits unembody'd who are beneficent and kind to us who are Spirits embody'd and not only converse with us below but are helpful and serviceable to us on all Occasions I can't remember all his hard Words Master but he said a deal more to that purpose  Au  Well did not he ask for your Money before hand too as t'other did  Com  No indeed but when he bad me tell him my Case I put my Hand in my Pocket and pull'd out two half Crowns and went to offer him the Money for I found he was not an ordinary Fellow and so I thought he would not be very lowpriz'd  Au  But he took the Money I suppose  Com  No he said he did not do these things for Money as he found I believ'd he did but he said you may put what you please in there pointing to a Box that stood upon the Table I shall dispose of it charitably and to better Uses it may be than you would do your self so I put the Money into his Box which had a slit like a Tradesman's Till  Au  Very well this look'd great indeed  Com  Then he bad me tell him my Case for says he I perceive you are a Man of a troubled  Countenance your Mind is oppress'd the Passions of your Soul have been in a Perturbation your Spirits are fluttering still and in a Storm tho' something abated of what they have been pray be very free and tell me your whole Case as fully and plainly as you can  Au  Well I assure you he spoke in state with a great deal of Majesty  Co m  Yes and yet he spoke very courteously too and I began to like him mightily so I began and told him my Case at large just as I did you Master  Au  That is to say that you wanted to be reveng'd of your Wife and to find out the Man that had cuckolded you and the like so you expected presently he should tell you who it was  Com  Yes so I did but he brought me to understand things better and I found he was in Earnest and that he was not to be cheated He examin'd me too as t'other had done and ask'd me abundance of Questions  Au  And I doubt not gather'd your Case in every Part of it from the weak inconsistent Account you gave him of it  Com  I don't know that but after he had done asking me all his Questions he took his Pen and Ink too and wrote down a great many things upon his Paper and made Lines with a short brass Rule and a Pencil and then took out a pair of Compasses and drew several Figures and Marks but I understood nothing of them neither could I see them distinctly by the Candle Light then he ask'd me my Christian Name which I told him was  Edward  and he set it down in great Letters but such as tho' I can read Master I am sure that I never saw such Before Then he ask'd my Wife's Christian Name too which I told him was  Abigal  and he set that down in the same kind of Letters as before  then he ask'd my Age and my Wife's Age and the Age of my two Children of all which I gave him a full Account  Au  I suppose you had told him that you had two Children he did not conjure out that did he  Com  Yes he had ask'd me that before and I told him so when he had done all and I believe we had talk'd together above an Hour he rose up and offer'd to go away and I rose up too but he laid his Hand upon my Arm Do you sit still says he and I'll come to you again at which I was a little frighted to be left alone and he perceiv'd it Don't be afraid says he there shall nothing hurt you nor speak to you and if you hear any Noise don't you stir but sit still here So he took up one of the Candles and went into another Room by a little Door like a ClosetDoor and when he shu  the Door after him I perceiv'd a little Window of one broad Square of Glass only that look'd into the Room which he was gone into  Au  I warrant ye you wanted to peep did not ye  Com  Yes I did but I durst not stir for my Life because he had charg'd me I should not  Au  Well but you was to hear some Noises was you not  Com  But I did not except once that I heard a Noise like the drawing of a Chair upon the Floor which being nothing but what was ordinary did not disturb me  Au  Well how long did he stay  Com  About half an Hour and came in again looking very well pleas'd and ask'd me how I did and then sat down as before Well says he I have been consulting on your Case and I find things not so threatning to you as I expected perhaps you may not be in so ill a Case as you imagine however I am order'd to tell you that some Days after your return your Wife shall come to a House  near you and send to know if you will receive her again kindly if the Person she sends is a Woman you may conclude your Wife has abus'd you but if she sends a Man then she is innocent and you are mistaken  Au  This was pointblank I assure you  Com  I did not like it however and that he might see well enough for I can't allow any if's or and's Tell me of being mistaken said I to him I can't be mistaken Well says he I'll go again and consult farther about you and seeing me begin to get up too he turns again You are not afraid says he are you No not at all said I Well nor you won't be afraid will you if you see nothing frightful No not at all said I again But I ly'd Master for I was almost frighted to Death when he spoke of my seeing something but as I had said No twice and spoke it pretty heartily too he said Well then come along with me into the next Room  Au  I doubt you were afraid then indeed  Com  Ay so I was heartily and he perceiv'd it too again Well says he if you are afraid to go into my Room of Practice I'll stay here with you only whatever you see or hear sit you still and neither speak or stir out of your Chair  Au  Well did you observe his Direction  Com  No indeed Master my Heart fail'd me I durst neither go nor stay but I'll tell you what I did when he was gone into the next Room I went to the Window and peep'd  Au  And what did you see 'tis odd peeping at the  Devil  I must tell you  Com  I saw my old Gentleman in a great Chair and two more in Chairs at some Distance and three great Candles and a great Sheet of white Paper upon the Floor between them every one of them had a long white Wand in their Hands the lower end of which touch'd the Sheet of Paper  Au  And were the Candles upon the Ground too  Com  Yes all of them  Au  There was a great deal of Ceremony about you I assure you  Com  I think so too but it is not done yet immediately I heard the little Door stir as if it was opening and away I skipp'd as softly as I could tread and got into my Chair again and sat there as gravely as if I had never stirr'd out of it I was no sooner set but the Door open'd indeed and the old Gentleman came out as before and turning to me said Sit still don't ye stir and at that Word the other two that were with him in the Room walk'd out after him one after another cross the Room as if to go out at the other Door where I came in but at the farther end of the Room they stop'd and turn'd their Faces to one another and talk'd but it was some Devil's Language of their own for I could understand nothing of it  Au  And now I suppose you were frighted in earnest  Com  Ay so I was but it was worse yet for they had not stood long together but the great ElbowChair which the old Gentleman sat in at the little Table just by me began to stir of it self at which the old Gentleman knowing I should be afraid came to me and said Sit still don't you stir all will be well you shall have no harm at which he gave his Chair a kick with his Foot and said Go with some other Words and of other Language and away went the obedient Chair sliding two of its Legs on the Ground and the other two off as if some body had dragg'd it by that Part  Au  And so no doubt they did tho' you could not see it  Com  As soon as the Chair was dragg'd or mov'd to the end of the Room where the three I know  not what to call 'em were two other Chairs did the like from the other side of the Room and so they all sat down and talk'd together a good while at last the Door at that end of the Room open'd too and they all were gone in a Moment without rising out of their Chairs for I am sure they did not rise to go out as other Folks do  Au  What did you think of your self when you saw the Chair stir so near you  Com  Think nay I did not think I was dead to be sure I was dead with the Fright and expected I should be carry'd away Chair and all the next Moment Then it was I say that my Hair would have lifted off my Hat if it had been on I am sure it would  Au  Well but when they were all gone you came to your self again I suppose  Com  To tell you the truth Master I am not come to my self yet  Au  But go on let me know how it ended  Com  Why after a little while my old Man came in again call'd his Man to set the Chairs to rights and then sat him down at the Table spoke chearfully to me and ask'd me if I would drink which I refus'd tho' I was adry indeed I believe the fright had made me dry but as I never had been us'd to drink with the  Devil  I didn't know what to think of it so I let it alone  Au  But you might e'en have ventur'd for the old Necromancer was but a Man whatever Correspondence he might have and his Ale would not have hurt you But what else did he say about your Business  Com  Why he told me the invisible Agents were favourable in their Answers that there appear'd nothing but well that he was assur'd by the Aspects which any way concern'd me that I was more concern'd about this Matter than  there was reason for that I should go home and wait till by the Signals he had given me I might judge for my self and till I heard from my Wife as before and that if I could make any plain Discovery that there was real Guilt I should come to him again and he would endeavour to point ou  the Man But if I could not I should rest satisfy'd that I had been wrong inform'd of things it my Family and might make my self easy  Au  This is an odd Story why this Man is only a Cheat like all the rest he bids you go home and if you can find out any real Guilt then come to him and he will tell you what to do that is to say he knows nothing Is this your Necromancer pray where does he dwell  Com  Nay Master the Man has done me n  wrong I was directed to the House but I can'  find it again if I was to be hang'd for missing it however I won't betray him neither let him b  what he will  Au  Well but it seems you are not fully satisfy'd yet because he does not confirm your Notion that your Wife is a Whore I fancy you have a Mind i  should be so  Com  I don't care what she is so I could bu  find it out  Au  But you see neither the honest Man a  Northampton  nor the  Devil  at  Oundle  would give you any reason to think so I would have you go home as the first Man advis'd you and be quiet I verily believe there's nothing at all in it but you have been a cruel Husband have us'd your Wife like a Dog and frighted her with worse and sh  is fled from you as a poor naked defenceless Sheep would from a Lion or a Wolf  Com  And you would have me go home and submit to my Wife no I'll hang my self first  Au  I don't say submit to your Wife tho' if you have wrong'd your Wife as I doubt you have I  ee no reason why you should not make a Wife Satisfaction for the Injury done her Character as well as you would to a Man that was able to cudgel you into it But I say go home and mend your Wife's Husband and that will in all probability mend your Wife and you may live comfortably again together  Com  I can't promise Master to take any of their Advices or your's either  This Story is not told so much to give an Account of the Man who was nothing as I could understand by it all but a base passionate Fellow to an honest Woman his Wife but 'tis a kind of a History of modern Magick or of the Craft which is at this time in Practice in the World Nor is it a singular Example for we have many more People among us who are Pretenders to the sacred Sciences as they call them who yet do not level their Knowledge of them to such mean Uses as to go Mountebanking with them to get a Crown or two for petty Discoveries and set up for what they call cunning Men which is indeed the lowest Step of this kind that a Spirit of the invisible World could well be suppos'd to take  It is true 'tis something hard to describe what this thing we call Magick is and how it is to be understood now what it was formerly we know something of and yet even then no great things were perform'd by it something they did whether by the thing it self as an Art or by the  Devil  being present to assist them we know not that which would be call'd wonderful is that they did then as they pretend to do still several things which the  Devil  really has no Power to do and particularly that of foretelling things to come which we do not generally speaking grant the  Devil  to have in his  Power he can indeed make better Judgment of things than we can but that the Knowledge of Futurity is given him I deny  For the Augurs and Southsayers they did strange things formerly by whose Power is not in my reach nor any ones else to determine For Example In the latter end of the Life of  Augustus Caesar  while the Ceremonies were performing in the  Campus Martius  the Emperor and a vast Concourse of People being present an Eagle came into the Place and hover'd over the Emperor some time flying round and round him in the Air and then flying towards a small Temple or Oratory it settled upon a little Pinacle just over the Statue of  Agrippa    This was taken as a Presage or Omen to the Emperor whether of Good or Evil was hard to determine but the  Augurs  being consulted they determin'd it to be Evil and that it betoken'd the Death of the Emperor in a short time  Another Accident happened the very next Day  viz  a Flash of Lightning broke upon the Statue of the Emperor over the SenateHouse and struck out the Letter  C  from the Word  Caesar  in the Inscription upon the Capital of the Work over the Statue The  Augurs  were again consulted and they again consulting with one another and by the ordinary Observations declar'd the Emperor would dye within a hundred Days signify'd by the Numeral Letter  C  being struck out and that he should then be reckon'd among the GODS because the Word  AESAR  in the  Hetrurian  Tongue signifies a GOD  Now it fell out according to this Prediction the Emperor and  Tiberius  his Heir Apparent went as far as  Beneventum  he was taken Sick there of a  Diarrhaea  and causing himself to be carry'd to  Nola  near  Capua  he expired ninety nine Days after the Stroke  of the ThunderBolt or Lightning as above If then the  Devil  has no Knowledge of Futurity but that the Study of the Intellectual World or World of Spirits be a  sacred Science  as the Professors of it contend then those  Augurs  who acted upon the foot of the ancient Magick were illuminated from those Intellectual Beings and had converse with Spirits of a differing kind from those which we call  Devils  or Diabolical  Now as 'tis hard to distinguish these Illuminations otherwise than by the Events and Consequences of the Intelligence they bring so I think that if first of all the Distinction be allow'd between good and evil Spirits then 'tis a just way of determining  viz  that such Intelligence as tends to the good of Mankind to the Propag  tion of Virtue and preserving Honour Chastity Property and Religion may be suppo  'd to proceed from good Spirits whether Angels or other Spirits unembodyed on the con  ray where the Correspondence has a general Tendency to Mischief to encourage Crime to the hu  t of Mankind in general to discourage Virtue and Religion to insult Heaven and in a word where the Tenour and Bent of the Illumination is to do Evil or to direct to the doing it there we may without Injury to Persons or to the  Devil  himself say it is from him or by his Agency and that he the  Devil  is principally concern'd in it for we know it is his Nature and particular Property to be propagating Evil and that he is apparently known to ha  e Mankind and abhor envy and malign the Holy Nature of the Eternal Being  It may be a very just Distinction between the blessed eternal Being and the curs  d exil'd condemn'd Species of Evil Angels in  word between God and the Devil to say o  them thus  GOD is the Perfection of Good  The Devil is the Extreme of Corruption  God the Perfection of Purity and Holiness  The Devil a Composition of the utmost Impurity  From these two Contraries derive  xecutive Power of Good and Evil  can no m  be the Genuine Par  actions than an ev  Tree can bring  good Frui  Darkness which is a Privation of  us Light can be a Consequence or Pro  of it  GOD can no more be the  of Evil than he can Annhilate himself and Cease to be and he cannot Cease to be because he that Exists from Eternity is Eternal and Exists necessarily as well as from himself  If then the Intelligence given or the Illuminations receiv'd by the Art which these Men pretend to is found to have these essential Qualifications of Goodness  viz  Beneficent to Mankind directing Men to the preserving Virtue Honour Property and Piety then I should be tempted to think they have an Acquaintance with the Intellectual World a Converse with good Spirits and a Prescience communicated from the good Angels those Guardians of Mankind waking Centinels set to guard the World from Evil and to counteract the Malice and Rage of Hell but not else  Here then is a Test of the  Magicians  Art and let us not be amus'd and impos'd upon by the Pretences to the sacred Sciences and to the study of exalted Mysteries Incantations Divine and Sublime and many other lofty Expressions significant in themselves but not so in the case before us unless testify'd by the Virtue and just Productions which appear in their Practice I say let us not be amus'd with these to embrace Hell in the Disguise  of Heaven and converse with a Deceiver in the Robes of an Angel of Light  If there are such glorious things attain'd to by Art and by the Study of these  sacred Sciences  where shall we find the Practice of them I think we must be referr'd back to the  Augurs  and  Diviners  among the more honest Heathens for we may almost answer for it that nothing of this kind is seen among us or at least if it is found in Theory and there is in Nature a Reality of Art such as I have mention'd above that Magick is a Science laudable in its Study justifiable in its Practice sublime in its Attainment it is yet so blended with the wicked Part by the Corruption of its Professors that we scarce know where to find one either in Being or in Story in the whole Christian Time whose Practice can be allow'd to be sacred whatever can be said of the Science  It is true there was a fam'd  Magician  in  Kent  who pretended to this and of whom I shall speak at large in the next Chapters and he seem'd to act wholly upon the Principle of doing good detecting punishing and exposing Crime but I shall give my Exceptions to it when I come to his Story  At present therefore the World are to be excus'd the Mistake if they run into it even with a kind of general Consent taking the Word Magick and Magician in the worst Sense understanding them all as practising the Diabolical Part of it  viz  a Converse with Evil Spirits and a Dealing with the  Devil  inclusive also of all those several Classes into which I have distinguish'd it before  Hence perhaps it is that in our Discoursing with even the most Learned Men upon this Subject a few a very few excepted it is very hard to bring them to any Notions of a Difference between Magick and Witchcraft between a Magician and a  Sorcerer between a Student in the exalted Sciences a Converser with the Intellectual World and a Wretch that has a Familiar a Wizzard or Necromancer but they will tho' they may be wrong in it too have them be reckon'd all in a Class that they are all Practitioners in the Diabolical Part and in a word that they all deal with the  Devil  Indeed the Difference is not easily preceptible because of the Pretences which the worst of them make to the high Illumination when they are really acting the vilest Part and that in the ordinary course of their Practice 'tis therefore by the Consequences only that they are to be known Witchcraft and Sorcery may in one Respect be justly said to be all Magick but I must not allow that all Magick is Witchcraft as I distinguish'd before between a Witch and a Wizzard But seeing it is so hard to know them asunder and that the Imposture is so great the best Method I can take is where History or Conversation will supply Materials to give you as many Examples of the several Practices and Practisers in these last Ages of the World as we can meet with as well for your Diversion as Instruction  I must here enter a Caution too against a weak but vulgar Mistake which to the Reproach of human Understanding the World has been very much possess'd with and that is to ascribe every difficult unaccountable Performance to the  Art Magick  and every superior Genius every Man of a sublime Thought and more than ordinary Capacity to be a  Magician Archimedes  was a most accomplish'd Genius and an excellent Mathematician but we will have him be a  Magician  too Fryar  Bacon  who by his Skill in the Mathematicks and the Doctrine of Motion and of Sounds made a BrazenHead to speak of which by the way there are many Examples in History more  ancient than Father  Bacon  yet we will have this honest Friar be a Witch a  Magician  a Conjurer only because the thing was beyond the ordinary Conception  Men of Thought and Head who have a Genius a little above their Neighbours have on all Occasions been liable to be thus treated even our Saviour himself when he acted such Wonders as the like had not been seen and cast out Devils what said the amaz'd World The more weak and admiring and innocent Thoughts were amaz'd the Text says they were astonish'd and at another time they were fill'd with Wonder and the like but the selfwise Heads the pretending Pharisees having neither Knowledge to reach the Divine Power by which he wrought and too much Pride to submit to Faith reproach'd him with dealing with the  Devil He casteth out Devils by  Belzeebub  the Prince of Devils  Mat xii  This Mistake may therefore take place in the Case before me and Men who have studied in the most exquisite manner any of the Sciences which are lawful and commendable and are arriv'd to a degree of Knowledge beyond others may be suspected of  Magick  and of the  Diabolick Magick  too which I have been speaking of  I will not venture to state the Bounds critically speaking between the lawful Study of Magick as a Science and the unlawful Part of its Practice as a Diabolick or a Black Art any more than between the noble Study of Astronomy including the Motions of the heavenly Bodies and that corrupt and horrid Impositio  that worst of Juggle the most simple and scandalous of all Cheats call'd judicial Astrology  That Magick may be a handle to Witchcraft that one may begin where the other ends this I will not deny but I must be allowed to say that if  there is an invisible World a World of Spirits if there is a Converse between the Spirits unembodied and our Spirits embodied which also I cannot deny whatever lawful way there can be found if such can be found to form an Intelligence between them must be a sublime and heavenly Attainment at the same time I will not venture to say such an Intelligence can be form'd  Nor will I venture to say that there can be any settled Method found out to call up any of those invisible Inhabitants of the World of Spirits to a visible Appearance in this World and to an audible and vocal Conversation so as to receive Intelligence of things present or Directions in things to come to be advised counselled or informed by them or to any such Purpose it does not seem probable If at any time they do or can appear which yet I do not grant it must be spontaneous and arbitrary how when where and on what Occasion they think fit But as to our calling them up by Art except it be by a Diabolical Magick and by the immediate Assistance of the  Devil  and perhap  too it may be only a Delusion of Satan's who pretending to visit us by the good Spirits we want to converse with constitutes a missionary  Devil  to personate the Spirit expected and so put a Cheat upon the Enquirer as the Witch of  Endor  raised  Spectre or Sham  Samuel  in the room of the tru  Prophet  Samuel  who we may without Presumption believe knew nothing of the matter  To pretend by Art to bring those good Spirit from their State of Felicity wherever it is to a  Appearance for our private Concerns seems to have no Consistence in the Nature of a future State that there may be an invisible and imperceptibl  Converse of Spirits which we cannot describe an  appointed by Providence for Ends which we do no  fully understand I believe is possible But it is the  done their own way and we know nothing of the manner  There is much said of Guardian Angels and some seeming Ground from Scripture but not enough to be called an Authority from whence to ground an  Hypothesis  of the manner nor will the greatest Magician that ever was how much soever he pretends to the sacred Science takes upon him to say he can call up or cause to appear one of those guardian Angels no not by the utmost and most exquisite Art that was ever attained to so that all that Part of calling up good Spirits or Guardian Angels to a visible Appearance seems to be fictitious and groundless As to calling up evil Angels or evil Spirits that is to say  Devils  as it is to be done by the Assistance of the  Devil  and that he has given his Assistance to the doing it and therefore can do it I make no Question and therefore when the Magicians do at any time bring up Appearances and frightful Apparitions by their Art I shall always suppose it to be the  Devil  that is to say the  Devil  raised by Consent of the  Devil  the  Devil  coming up at their Call who he had before consented should have Leave to call him for he must come Voluntier too nor can he be called up or disturbed without his Consent but he bargains with those wicked People upon such Conditions as they agree between them that he shall obsequiously attend whenever they use such and such Methods to call him and this is Witchcraft and this is Magick This  Magick  is  Witchcraft  and this  Witchcraft  is  Magick  let any one distinguish between them if they can  CHAP III  Of the present Pretences of the Magicians How they defend themselves and some Examples of their Practice  THE Magicians such as acknowledge them  e  es  acquainted with the  Black Art  as we call i  are not dumb and speechless in their own Case on  he contrary they defend themselves with the utmost Artifice have their historical Accounts of their Practice and give the most fair and plausible Sketches of the Art it self that can be imagin'd  They insist that it is a general Mistake a vulgar Error and injurio  s to all the Practisers of this Science to say they have a Familiar as we understand the Word th  is an evil Spirit or that they deal with the  Devil  they own they have Access to and an Intercourse with superiour Beings and converse with the World of Spirits but that they are the good and welldisposed Spirits who are always beneficent kind and ready to do all possible Offices of Love to Mankind that they are certainly influenc'd from above and that consequently it is so far from being true that they are Diabolick and wicked Spirits that on the contrary they are always employed in Matters superiour to the Nature of the Infernal Spirits that they do not amuse the World with Fictions and deceive and abuse the People that come to them with their Enquiries that they do not like the Devil's Oracles of old give ambiguous and doubtful Answers in the Cases and Enquiries that are brought before them to cheat and delude the innocent Enquirer but that they on the contrary tell them the Truth of every thing be it for Good or Evil  to them that they often detect Criminals expose Vice prevent Mischief and promote Virtue Things no body will pretend are in the Intent and Meaning of evil Spirits that they do not impose upon the ignorant to cheat and defraud them or make unjust Advantages of them  In discoursing many Years since upon this Subject with a particular Friend a judicious and learned Man and one that was not easily imposed upon I seemed to be doubtful of the Reality of the thing in general and whether there was indeed such a thing as that of Men having Intercourse with the World of Spirits and whether we might distinguish between that and Witchcraft insisting that I thought it was all Witchcraft Sorcery and the  Devil    He told me he was of my Mind 'till some Years before that he had Occasion to converse with the famous Magician called Dr  Boreman  in  Kent  who he assured me was a very grave judicious Man and as he believed a good Man I had once said he above all the rest a long Conference with him on a particular Occasion but 'tis too long to tell you the Particulars If 'tis not too long for you to tell  said I  it will not be too long for me to hear for I am really impatient to know what is to be known of that Kind and the more because I am at a loss to pass a Judgment about it Well  said he  if I tire you then with the length of it tell me and I will leave off So he began his Story thus  'I had  said he  a Friend a young Man who desired me upon an extraordinary Occasion to go with him as he called it to a  Cunning Man    '  I asked him  What was the Business  '  He said  It was Business of Consequence to him and tho' he did not care to tell it just then yet I should know it afterward  '  I told him  I had no Faith at all in those sort of People whom they called Cunning Men  'Nay  says he  I believe they deal with the  Devil  but I don't care for that if I can but have Satisfaction in what I go about  '  I told him  I differ'd from him in that too for I neither believed that they dealt with the  Devil  or the  Devil  with them or that they could say any thing to him that was to the Purpose  'Why they do tell strange things  says he    '  I told him  I believed nothing of it but that it was all a Cheat and so I seem'd loth to have him go to the  Cunning Man  at all  NB  You must understand here that my Friend was not so really doubtful as he made the young Man believe he was but as he had told me before he believ'd there was something in it but he could never come at the Speech of one of the Pretenders to the Art and so was entirely ignorant of what they did or how they proceeded and therefore as he told me he was mighty willing to go with him tho' he made some Shew of being backbackwards so he went on with his Discourse  'I was not only loth to let him go says my Friend but I told him I did not care for it and therefore desired he would excuse me going with him but when he told me who the cunning Man was and that he would go to the famous Dr  Boreman  my Curiosity prevail'd with me not only not to perswade him against going but to resolve to go with him my self  'In a word we appointed a Day and I went with him for I had a great mind to talk with the Doctor  'When we came to the House it was in  Kent  not far from  Maidstone  where the Doctor liv'd at that time I don't remember the Place exactly but I say when we came to the Place a Servant came to the Door and very civilly led us into the House and bad us sit down leaving us in a large Hall where we walk'd about looking on his Magical Pictures of which we saw a great many whose meaning I did not at all understand and the Servant went away as I suppose to call his Master  'After a while the Doctor came in with a Staff in his Hand like a Crutch as I thought and I thought also he was lame having lately had the Gout He was a grave old Man with a long black Velvet Gown on his Beard long and the upper Lip of it trimm'd into a kind of  Muschato  a Cap on his Head with a Border of Hair within it as was the Custom in those Days  'After usual Civilities he began to enquire our Business and directing his Speech to me as the Senior in appearance I told him that young Man pointing to him that came with me my Friend had something of Importance to communicate to him and which he wanted his Advice in and so says he I bid the young Man give the Doctor an Account of his Business  'This young Man had it seems a particular Case which he went to him about and tho' he had desired me to go with him as I have said yet he had not told me his Case so I was oblig'd to direct him to tell it himself  'Then the Doctor desir'd the young Man to give him his Case in writing but he told him he could not write well enough or explain his Case so intelligibly to him in writing'  'Well then  says the Doctor  tell it me in Words at length and I'll write it down from your own  Mouth However I perswaded him to write it down as well as he could upon which he desired a Pen Ink and Paper which the Doctor order'd his Man to give him and in the mean time the Doctor ask'd me to walk into another Room come says he we will leave him to do it that we may not disturb him So we went into the next Room  'Then he began a Discourse by asking me if I knew any thing of the young Man's Case which I really did not and therefore told him so but if I had known it I should hardly have given him any Account for I took that to be a Piece of his Art to pick as much of the Circumstance of the Case out privately as he could so to guide his Answers but I quite mistook the Man From that we fell into several other Discourses and among the rest I asked the Doctor if it would be no Offence to him to let us talk a little about the Study of those things which he was so fam'd for  'He said No not at all if I was disposed to talk of them in a serious and friendly manner  'I told him I hoped he did not think I had any ill Design tho' a Stranger if he did I would not desire to say any more and that as I did not know what he might understand by the Word Friendly I would not move it any farther  'He said He did not apprehend any thing dangerous for he used no unlawful Arts but he said several Persons made a Jest of those things which he esteemed sacred and that he did not care for those Discourses or those People who buffoon'd things because they did not understand them  'I told him that whatever I thought he should find I would neither treat him or the Subject we might discourse of with any Disrespect  'He told me he would take my Word for it so we fell into several Discourses about  Science  in general particularly of the Study of Magick and the Practice of it and when first it was known in the World  'He told me I seem'd Ignorant in the thing it self and to what purpose says he should I go to speak of the Original of a thing which you have not right Notions of So we discours'd a little farther upon it thus  A  What Notions would you have me entertain of it I scarce know what you mean by the thing itself  Dr  Why  Sir  you seem neither to know what I mean or what you mean your self  A  That is to say  I do not express my self perhaps right then you may set me to rights and it would be very kind to do so  Dr  You speak of my practising  as an Art  now I practise  no Art  nor use any  Art  I am no  Juggler  Sir you don't see me shew Tricks  A  I wou'd not offend you Sir will you tell me then what it is you do practise  Dr  Neither will I be offended but if you will give me leave to ask you a previous Question or two I shall be the better able to answer your other Question afterwards  A  Any Question you please  Dr  Why then will you tell me what brought you hither to me  A  Why really Sir my Answer must be  I cannot well tell  my Friend who is writing there in the other Room will tell you that better than I  Dr  Why then shall I tell you what you come for perhaps you'll think that something odd  A  So indeed I should if I did not consider you as  a Man of Art    Dr  No no not a Man that deals with the  Devil  as you fancy I do  A  Nay you must deal with some body if you tell me my Business here when I don't know it my self  Dr  Why I will tell you in few Words then  your Friend comes  about Business  you  to satisfy your Curiosity  A  Upon my Word I think you are in the right  Dr  Well I have used no great matter of ART you see yet  A  Nay I don't know that I suppose wh  you do is pretty much in the dark and imperceptible so you might use Art and I know nothing of it  Dr  That's true or else it would be no Art  A  But is my Curiosity any Offence to you Doctor if it is I'll ha' done and say no mo  but leave you and my Friend together for I don'  come to affront you far from it I assure you  Dr  No no 'tis no Offence at all to me on+ly since you seem to talk friendly and freely gi  me leave to ask you some Questions first and th  I'll state yours for you and answer them directly and I hope to your Satisfaction  A  With all my Heart ask me what y  please  Dr  What did you suppose me to be what did your Friend tell you I was before y  came  A  And you will promise me not to take it if I speak plain English  Dr  Not in the least I'll put it into yo  Mouth for I know what you took me for as w  as you do your self  A  I doubt you do Sir and that looks as if  were in the right  Dr  Not at all neither but of that afterwards you and your Friend took me for a  Necromancer  a  Magician  one that deals with the  Devil  can raise the  Devil  converses with him and by his Help can resolve difficult Questions give Answers in doubtful Cases and in short that I am a  Conjurer    A  And so you must be I think or else how do you know all this  Dr  How I know it is not the Question but whether it is true or no  A  Exactly true to a tittle  Dr  And if I am no such Person have I not then a great deal of wrong done me  A  You know Sir 'tis natural for People to say a Man deals with the  Devil  when he tells People their Thoughts foretells to them what comes to pass and resolves such Doubts as no body but the  Devil  could resolve  Dr  And perhaps the  Devil  himself could not do those things if he was to appear and do his utmost for he knows no more of things to come than you or I do and perhaps not so much  A  Nay do not join me to your self pray for you may know more than the  Devil  himself can tell you  Dr  Or else I would burn my Books and pretend no more to the sacred Sciences which I have so much Veneration for and which you call  my Practice    A  If I was sure of that I should have another kind of Notion of you and your Practice than I have yet I assure you  Dr  If you was sure of what  A  Why that you do not perform these things by the Help of a familiar Spirit  Dr  Nay hold I don't say that neither but are there no Spirits but what are  Devils  A  I don't know indeed as to that but we understand no other when we talk of a  familiar Spirit  we always understand by it the  Devil    Dr  Then you misunderstand it Sir that's certain unsufferable Ignorance why are there no good Spirits  A  I can say nothing to that  Dr  And perhaps are not desirous to be informed  A  Nay there you wrong me and take me for a Fool into the Bargain for there are none but Fools that have no Delight in understanding I would be inform'd of every thing that I do not know  Dr  There would be no such things as Fools Sir if they were willing to be inform'd  If Fools could their own Ignorance discern  They'd be no longer Fools because they'd learn  A  Well I am very willing to learn I assure you and of you too whatever you please to inform me perhaps I may be in the wrong as to what you say of good Spirits but I never heard of any  Dr  That's strange indeed you have been much out of their Care sure  A  I don't know that neither I hope not If they have any of us in Charge for Good I may be under their Care I hope and yet know nothing of it my self  Dr  At least it seems you have been out of their Acquaintance but that is not much to the Case the Loss has been yours to be sure and the Fault too  A  The Loss may have been mine but how does it appear that the Fault has been mine too  Dr  It seems evident to me and perhaps I may convince you of it if you allow me to ask you a few more such innocent Questions as these  A  With all my Heart especially if they are innocent  Dr  If you have any Reason to suspect them do not answer  A  And you give me Leave to use my Liberty Sir without Offence  Dr  Ay your utmost Liberty Sir why should I be offended I think you ought rather to be offended if I ask any thing that does not become me The first Question I would ask you is whether you think there is an invisible World  A  That's no unfair Question at all and you shall find Sir I won't cavil I'll answer directly I make no doubt but there is  Dr  But let my Question be direct too by an invisible World I don't mean  as the Astronomers suggest  that there are Planetary Worlds made invisible only to us by their Distance  A  No no I do not take you so I believe there is a World of Spirits and that I suppose is what you mean by invisible also that this World you speak of is inhabited by Spirits only and therefore justly called invisible  Dr  You are kind nay generous in Argument for you grant faster than I ask  A  I do that to save Circumlocutions and giving you Trouble  D  Well Sir where do you suppose this World of Spirits is for there must be a Locality for the dwelling even of Spirits how else do we call it a World and Heaven itself is a Place according to the common understanding of the Word  A  It is hard to say where it is at least 'tis hard to me so I cannot answer that Question at least not directly as I would do  Dr  It is true the infinite Spaces above are not easily described as they are not to be mathematically lin'd out but we have Reason to know the Inhabitants of it are not very remote from us and that brings on another Question  A  I know some People think the Regions of the Air even within the Compass of the Atmosphere are full of Spirits and that of divers kinds some good and some evil  Dr  I have nothing to say to that Notion I can't allow they inhabit promiscuously the same Regions and dwell together as good and bad People live here among one another without Distinction  A  I don't pretend to resolve that Question indeed  Dr  Neither did I propose it Sir but my Question is this As you grant a World of Spirits and that you do not know where it is so that for ought you know it may be very near as well as very remote nor to a Spirit is distance of Place any thing worth considering if I may speak my Opinion But my Question I say is this Do you believe that the Spirits inhabiting the invisible World have any Converse with us or with our embodied Spirits in this World  A  Truly it is a nice Question and what I have often considered very seriously I am of Opinion there is a certain secret Converse of Spirits tho' I cannot understand any thing of the manner  Dr  Well Sir your Conceptions are much the same with mine only that you believe there is and I am sure of it  A  That's carrying it a great way and I think this brings me to turn the Tables and to demand Leave to ask you some Questions in my turn if you have done or when you have done  Dr  With all my Heart Sir pray ask what you please  A  My first Question will be Sir how you can say you are sure there is such a Converse with the Spirits of the invisible World  Dr  Because I have actually convers'd with them my self  A  Now you come to the Point indeed But what then do you call Conversing  Dr  Why I call seeing them speaking to them and hearing them speak Conversing is not that as clear as the other  A  The Expression is clear but the thing express'd is not so  at least not to me  How do you reconcile seeing and speaking to the thing call'd Spirits  Dr  Why therein you and I differ in our Circumstances and this is the sublime Quality of the Sciences which we profess that being under the Operation of a higher and exalted Mind the Eyes of the Soul which is a Spirit can operate upon immaterial Objects and see what to common Sight is call'd invisible  A  This is all mysterious and if you will allow me the Freedom we should call it all Cant and unintelligible  Dr  I know it very well and we on the other hand call your Discourse empty and insignificant for that you neither understand what you say nor say what you might easily be taught to understand and if a Man enlightned in this superior Manner comes to talk with you and would instruct you a little you presently fly out and cry a Magician a Conjurer that he has a Familiar and deals with the  Devil  this was not always so  A  This brings me to my first Question Sir exactly  namely  Whence is the Orignal of what you  call your sublime Practice and where and when did it begin  Dr  I could run you back Sir to its Original and give you the History of it but 'twould be too long I doubt your want of Patience  A  My Curiosity is too great to let me want Patience  Dr  Well I'll give you an Abridgement then of it  thus  Before the  Deluge  when the Antediluveans had the Blessing of Longevity to the Number of almost a thousand Years we have many Testimonies of their conversing not only with the Spirits of the invisible World but with the great Life of Spirit the Being of Beings and if we can deduce any thing from Consequences divine Spirits daily illuminated the Minds of Mankind and convey'd all useful Science to them and that to such a degree as has never been attain'd to since by which all the most exalted Parts of both natural and supernatural Knowledge were convey'd into their Understandings  A  They had without question a superior Genius in the Antediluvean State far above what we have now and your Notions of that kind are very clear to me I agree with you in that  Dr  They had not so much a superior Genius as they had a superior Illumination what should you and I have if we had liv'd three or four hundred Years and had convers'd all that while in an angelick Society and with an invisible Species of Creatures in whom compleat Knowledge was but meer Nature and who had the Goodness to be always communicating the most perfect Ideas the most sublime Images to our Thoughts what should we be capable of  A  Nay I think you might say what should we not be capable of  Dr  Then considering that at the end of that three or four hundred Years we were but in the Prime of our Age in full Strength of Judgment and Vigour of Mind capable to receive the most divine Impressions of sacred Knowledge what should we not learn with such Teachers  A  But how do we know that they were thus bless'd  Dr  Why does not all your Accounts of those Times bring in the People conversing thus Nay do you not say that GOD or that Inconceivable Something which you call so the King and Governor and Maker of Spirits convers'd among them talk'd with and to them  A  Yes we believe GOD himself convers'd with them particularly with  Adam  the first of them and with  Noah  he last of them and no doubt with many others between  Dr  Well and did the great Being of Beings converse with Man and not the smaller and lower degrees of Spirit do you think the Servants did not converse if the Master did  A  Why that indeed I never consider'd before I confess  Dr  But where else had they the Knowledge of some things which nothing but Spirit and spirituous Converse could possibly convey  A  What things were they I do not rightly understand you  Dr  Why first for Example MUSICK that Heavenly Science the Doctrine of Sounds measur'd and divided so as by Dissonance to make Harmony to be admir'd by every Ear to move the Passions and agitate the Soul to be read by Notes understood by the differing Key of Sounds the only universal Character in the  World Could the Genius of Man invent it No it came from the invisible World and was certainly communicated from the Fountain of Knowledge by the Agency of the good Spirits with which they so freely conversed  A  You advance boldly Doctor  Dr  That may fairly be asserted which is impossible to be otherwise  A  I won't venture to say it is impossible  Dr  But I dare say it and with good Reason then there is the Doctrine of NUMBERS which we call vulgarly  Arithmetick  this with  Musick  seem to be two Infinites the Bounds of them and the Variety is not to be measur'd or conceiv'd of and how could human Genius measure them out  A  What do you inferr from thence  Dr  Nothing but this that those good beneficent Spirits with whom Mankind had then the Blessing of a daily Society fill'd their Minds and inspir'd their Thoughts with these noble and useful Discoveries and qualify'd them daily to improve upon them  A  You talk above me now indeed  Dr  You cannot say but I talk plainly and intelligible  A  So you conclude that the good Spirits instructed them in these sublimer Parts of Knowledge Pray why did they not teach them Astronomy natural Philosophy and all the usefu  Branches of the Mathematicks  Dr  And so no doubt they did There's th  Ark  for Example you say GOD spoke to  Noah  and told him in general what kind of Vessel  should be by which I suppose you may understand GOD told him that the World should b  drown'd and that he should be sav'd in a Ship which he should build But can you think  Noa  could do all this without the more particular Direction of these good and beneficent Spirits instructing him how to perform the Work How the Beams and the Timbers the Planks and all the Parts were to be put together how the Bottom was to be shap'd for swimming the Head and the Stern for breaking off the Force of the Water in that truly unbounded Ocean the Flood all these things I make no Question he was instructed in by the daily Assistance of the good Inhabitants of the invisible Regions who freely had at that time an Intercourse with the embodyed that is imprison'd Spirits of Men and these are the same that we converse with now so that I have fairly brought it down to our own Times  A  Sir your Discourse is very well laid together I confess but you make a long leap and some of it in the dark too from  Noah  and the Year of the World or thereabouts to our time which is about three thousand Years after How is it that those good Spirits left off their Goodwill towards Men and seem to shun us as much now as they courted us before  Dr  I do not find it so I rather say they do and would converse with us still if we either saw the Blessing of it or knew how to value it and made it appear we desir'd it  A  But when did it break off what did the Flood put an end to it  Dr  It seems that Men by a differing Conduct and a way of Life too gross for so excellent and sublime a Converse have render'd themselves unworthy and unqualify'd since the Flood so that the angelick Train seem to have forsaken the Earth and only communicate themselves to such as render themselves acceptable and worthy by a Life of earnest Application to the Study of divine  Science and who seek after the high Illumination  A  So that there are some who enjoy this extraordinary Society still  Dr  Why not pray The good Spirits are the same they change not neither is their Goodwill towards Men abated but the custom of the World has been and still is to be shy and afraid of them take them to be evil Spirits and as the World calls them Devils so that a good Spirit cannot now offer its Assistance to Man or go about to do any good to Mankind but they are frighted and terrify'd and cry out  the Devil  fly from it and refuse to accept the Benefit offer'd  A  But it seems all do not treat them so  Dr  No But how then are they treated who act after another manner  A  Why how are they treated  Dr  Are we not treated as Daemoniacks as Magicians and Conjurers Necromancers and that deal with the Devil Did not you take me for such  A  It is very true I did  Dr  Ay and are you not under some sort of Fright even all the while you are talking with me as if you were talking with the Devil and lest I should raise the  Devil  while you are here  A  I cannot say but it is in some measure true  Dr  And yet we know no more of the  Devil  than you do nor converse any more with him than other Folks do nor so much neither  'Having carried on our Conversation thus far my Companion who was all this while a writing his Case came to the Door and calling to the Doctor told him he had done Well  says the Doctor to him  pray give me the Paper then and let me read it over so he gave him his Paper which was a long one indeed and very close written  containing all his Case which it seems was very particular and requir'd abundance of better Advice than I thought the grave Doctor was able to give him but I was really mistaken  I was far from being tir'd with this Account and believe I shall not tire the Reader with setting it down Indeed I interrupted him here with asking him if he did not yet know his Man's Case and if he did not read the Paper but he told me he did not so I desir'd him to let me have the rest of the Story and he went on thus  'My Man said he who was with me told me little or nothing of his Case as I hinted before except that he said it was very Difficult and Intricate and that if it could not be resolv'd and brought to a Conclusion he was sure he should never get over it but should be undone and that therefore he came to this Man  'Why  says I  what do you take the Man to be  'Why what should I take him for  says he  'Nay I suppose  said I  you take him for a Conjurer and one that deals with the  Devil    'I care not who he is or who he deals with  says the Man  so I do but get my Business done by him find out a Man or two that I look for and have some satisfaction in my other Affairs  'I don't know who you look for  said I  and I doubt you don't know who 'tis you seek to  'Why the  Devil says he  who d'ye think I seek to when I come to a  Cunning Man  'This Discourse was before we came to the Doctor's House and was the Occasion indeed that I was at first so shy of him and made so many roundabout Cautions when I first spoke to him  'When he had written his Case down and given it to the  Magician  the Doctor ask'd him if he could not leave the Paper with him and  come again in two or three Days The Enquirer seem'd uneasy at that tho' he did not directly say  No  but the Doctor perceiv'd it Well then said he are you willing to stay here with me about eleven or twelve Hours and sit up all Night The Man look'd earnestly at me as if it had been to ask me whether he should venture to stay all Night but withal look'd a little frighted too  'The Doctor seeing him look at me as if he would ask my Advice turn'd to me smiling at the Man's Backwardness  'Sir  says he  I perceive you must decide it he seems a little frighted I don't know at what  'Sir  says I  smiling I believe he is afraid the Candles will  burn blue    'Ay  says he  you see the Reason why the good Spirits have left off conversing with Mankind and you see how we that are Men of Art and who have studied the sacred Sciences suffer by the Errors of common Fame they take us all for DevilMongers damn'd Rogues and Conjurers  'It is very true Sir said I I see it now he is afraid in short that you will raise the  Devil  With that he turns to the Man Hark ye Friend says he are you afraid to stay all Night speak honestly if you are and tell me so  'Why Sir  says the Man  I can't say but I am a little uneasy about it tho' I don't know at what for I an't very apt to be afraid of Sights not I With that I put in a Word to my Companion Why Cousin says I if you are uneasy about seeing any strange Sight or hearing any thing uncommon what did you come to this Gentleman for you know very well what you told me you understood him to be and what you expected of him  'Nay  says the Conjurer  I must needs say he that is afraid to the see  Devil  should never come to see US  'Why you don't always deal with the  Devil  do ye  says the Man    'Nay  says he  I han't told you yet that I deal with him at all but I say you should not be afraid of him when you come of these Errands for it seems you suppose we talk with him for you  'Why that is as much as to tell me  says the young Man  you can raise the  Devil  for me if you please  'Well come be plain with me and tell me have you have a Mind to see him or no says the Doctor laughing  'No not I  says he  not at all and that made me uneasy  'Well well  says he  you shall not see the  Devil  then  'But shall I see nothing else Sir says he I would see none of your Spirits whether they are Devils or no  'I tell you says the Doctor you shall see nothing to hurt you  'But says the Man again I don't know what to say you speak in generals pray don't fright me any more than hurt me  'I tell thee again says the Doctor I'll neither  hurt  thee nor  fright  thee but if you will have nothing done for you what do you give me your Case for and if you are afraid to see or hear any thing why do you not care to leave your Case with me and come again  'This was such a reasonable Proposal that I could not but tell my young Man that I thought he was playing the Fool with the Doctor if you stay you must be content to see what is to be seen and if you don't care to venture that can't  you go and come again so in a word I advis'd him to leave his Case with the Doctor and go away and come for an Answer when he should appoint him  'As we were going away the Doctor takes me by the Hand the young man being gone out of the Door You see Sir the Notions the poor innocent wellmeaning People have of all the good Spirits of the invisible World and tho' in their Distresses they will come to us and we make some Search for them yet they give the  Devil  all the Praise of it nay tho' they receive good from it and yet they acknowledge the  Devil  to be the Author of nothing but Mischief  'But Sir said I you could I suppose give this honest Man what Answer you shall purpose to give him without letting him see any Appearances to fright or terrifie him  'I have nothing about me says he or that converses with me that need to fright or terrifie any one much less that will do him any hurt I do not say but as the good Spirits are beneficent and kind and may meet and converse upon any Occasions and in any Place from their own happy Inclination to serve and assist the oppress'd or indigent Creatures may come and go pass and repass in or near my House which would be to me the greatest Felicity of Life On this Occasion the Man might have heard some little Noises and perhaps have seen some Motions rather than Bodies which he might call Spectres and Apparitions or Devils or what he would yet these as they would take no Notice of him or do any thing to terrify or disorder him so he would have nothing to do but to sit still and not offer to stir or speak and be under no Concern at all  'Well Sir  said I  were the Case mine as it is not I assure you I would have trusted you for  I do not think let the Case be what it will that it is your Business to suffer your Clients to receive any Hurt in your House or to be frighted so as to bring any evil Report upon you  'Sir  says the Doctor  my Business is to do good to all Men and to hurt none as is the Desire of those superior Beings which I have the Happiness to converse with and therefore it only is wanting to us that the poor People were a little less afraid of us and that they came to us for meer Necessity only and not meerly to satisfie their Curiosity as is often their Case However  added he  as to the young Man your Friend let him go home tomorrow you will see he will come back to me in a great Hurry tho' I han't order'd him to come till  Friday as you heard  but I warrant ye he will dream some strange Dream tonight his very Fright will make him do it and then he will come and desire me to interpret his Dream for him and then you may hear farther  'Well Sir  said I  I shall observe him and perhaps he will ask me to come along with him if he does I shall venture to come  'No  says the Doctor  I don't think he will ask you to come I believe he will be in better Heart tomorrow and it may be he'll offer to stay all Night with me and all Day too if I desire him let him s  e what he will  'I think  said I  he's a Fool he don't stay now indeed if it had been my Case I would have trusted you  'Well Sir  says he  if you have any Occasion in which I can render you any Service I shall be always ready to answer your Expectations in the best manner I am able and in the mean time I hope you will no more have those weak Notions as if all the Intelligence Mankind can attain to from the invisible World must be with  the  Devil  or the evil Spirits I hope you will see that there are Cases come before me which the  Devil  would no more be a  Devil  if he should give any Satisfaction in or any Relief to the Inquirer  'I gave him an Answer in as obliging Terms as I could and so we parted and I came to the young Man who waited for me with the utmost Impatience and with some kind of Terror for I found he was in a Sweat tho' it was a cold Evening too  'When I came up to him I ask'd him how he did  'Pretty well  says he  but I'm glad I am got away  'Why so  said I  No body offer'd to detain you I thought the Doctor spoke very civilly to you and I'm sure he did so to me  'Ay  says he  he did so and I had a mind to have ventur'd once to stay all Night but I am heartily glad I didn't I should have been frighted out of my Wits if I had seen the  Devil    'Why I can assure you that he says positively he has nothing to do with the  Devil  and if you had seen any Appearance it would have not been an evil Spirit or  Devil  but a good Spirit that it would have come to render you Service and do you good rather than have hurt you and that you would have had no need to be frighted  'No matter for that  says he  all Spirits are Devils to me if I had seen a Spirit or an Apparition all he could have said to me would not have perswaded me to believe it had not been the  Devil    'Why would you not have believ'd the Doctor if he had told you so  'No  says he  nor a hundred conjuring Doctors more not I  'But what is it you go to him for then  said I  If you won't believe what he says what signifies your going to him you had better have kept it to your self and never have troubled him  'Nay that's true  said he  and that was the reason I was loth to leave my Case with him  'But you have left it with him  says I  han't you  'Yes  says he  and let him make the best of it and the worst of it I never intend to go to him again  'What says I won't you go to him for an Answer  'No not I  said he  I have enough of him come away I am so frighted already I am almost dead don't you see what a Sweat I am in for all 'tis such cold Weather the Sweat runs down my Face in Drops  'Why what d'ye sweat for now  said I  You are far enough out of his way here an't you  'No no  says he  Why if he has his  Devil  within Doors d'ye think he has not his  Devil  without Doors too Why all the while I have stood here for you I fancy every Tree is a Man and every Man a Shadow and every Shadow a Spirit  'You see  said I  'tis Evening and the Light begins to be Dusky and so you see double Why sure you an't so frighted as you seem to be  'Indeed I am  says he  I don't know what's the matter I don't use to be so I us'd to laugh at People when they talk'd of seeing Apparitions and being frighted with Spirits  'Well well you'll come again for all that  said I  I warrant you  'No if the  Devil  catches me there again I'll forgive him  says he    'You don't know your own Mind  said I  Why he will answer all your Questions  'Ay so he shall when I come again  says he    'I warrant you'll come again to him  says I  for an Answer tomorrow  'Nay  says he  I am not appointed till  Friday    'Ay  says I  tis no matter for that I dare say you won't have Patience to stay so long Why you'll dream of it all Night I don't doubt but you'll be with him again also for Satisfaction to your Enquiries I know you han't the Patience tho' I don't know your Case  'You may say what you will  says he  but I assure you I'll go near him no more  'This kind of Discourse held us to a Town hard by where we lodg'd that Night for it was too late to go any farther And in the Morning I happen'd to oversleep my self For in short my Head ran so much upon the Doctor and his invisible World that it kept me awake almost all Night so that in the Morning when I got up 'twas near ten a Clock  'When I call'd for my young Man the Master of the House told me he was gone Gone said I what and never stay for me nor to speak to me  'Nay Sir says the Man of the House I believe he is mad Why he has made such a Noise and a Disturbance he has frighted all the House two of my People have been fain to sit up with him all Night he says he has seen the  Devil    'Seen the  Devil  says I does he know the  Devil  when he sees him I believe he never saw him i  his Life I suppose it was some Dream  'Nay  says the Man  I don't know how h  should see the  Devil  here I'm sure my Hous  is not haunted I fancy he has been at Dr  Bore+man  's lately  'Dr  Boreman  says I who's that  'O Sir  says my Landlord  did you never hear of Dr  Boreman  Why he's the most famous Man in all this Country he does a thousand strange things  'What  says I  is he a Conjurer does he deal with the  Devil    'I don't know for that  says my Landlord  I can't fancy he deals with the  Devil  neither for he is a very honest Gentleman and does a great many good things Folks that deal with the  Devil  don't use to do any thing that's good  'Pr'ythee  says I  what good does he do  'Why Master  says my Landlord  they say he lays the  Devil  when other Folks raise him he can cure a House when it's haunted Here was a House in our Town so plagu'd with evil Spirits that no body could lie in it and when the Doctor was sent for he went and sat up all Night in it what he did there no body knows but he so frighted the  Devil  to be sure that the House has never been haunted any more since and the poor Wenches are so afraid of him all round the Country that they dare not see him  'Why  says I  what does he do to them  'Why Sir  says he  a poor Girl can't let a young Fellow kiss her but the Docter will TELL and if they prove with Child he'll tell the Father of it presently nay he'll discover all the little whoreing Intrigues in the Country Now Master  adds he  this is not Devil's Work you know the  Devil  didn't care if they were all Whores not he  'That's very true indeed  says I  but what then must the Doctor be call'd is he a  Magician  'I suppose he is Master  says he  tho' I don't know what that means But he charms Folks and sets Spells and a young Fellow dares not  come near an honest Girl for fear of him Why they say he drew a Circle the other Day round a young Lass's Bed that was suspected and when the Fellow that they thought had to do with her came to her truly he could not get away till the Doctor was sent for to release him  'And do you believe all this  said I    'Believe it Sir  says he  Why all the Country believes it and the young People are kept in such Awe by it that I don't think there will be one Bastard got this Year no not in twenty Parishes hereabout and that's very hard Master  says he  this War time too when the King is like to want Soldiers  'This Discourse was diverting but still I wanted to hear of my Man I was loth to go back to the Doctor to seek him there so I was oblig'd to go away without him  Thus far I have entertain'd you with my Friend's Relation as I had it from him in a continu'd Discourse and this last Part is merry enough nor is it more than I have heard by many other Hands I mean of the Doctor's Exploits and particularly 'twas certainly true of him that he kept all the young People I mean the wicked part of 'em in Awe whether by Spells or Charms and what those Spell or Charms were that I could never come to a Certainty about  The Story of his perswading a young Fellow and his Wench to get both into her Smock and that when he was in the Doctor set his Spell upon him so that he could never get out till the Doctor was sent for to release him and that he would not release him till the Fellow oblig'd himself to marry the Girl this Story I say is so firmly believ'd all over that Part of the Country that no body doubts of it  But to come back a little to my Friend and the Story of the young Fellow that was with him which I shall give you now in a more summary way it being too long for my Work The Short of the Case was this The Fellow being heartily frighted as you have heard was no sooner got to Bed and fell fast asleep but he dreamed that the Doctor came into his Chamber and to his Bedside with two  Devils  or Spirits with him that he was at first so terrified that he was not able to speak but that the Doctor spoke kindly to him and bad him not be afraid for that here was a good Angel come to him to give him a full Answer happy and for his Satisfaction to all his Difficulties and that he had nothing to do but to hear and receive his Message and be easy and that upon this the Spirit advanced close to the Bedside but that he cry'd out and refused to hear him at which the Doctor spoke angrily to him and said Well since you refuse the Advice and Direction of a good Spirit we shall leave you to the same disturbing  Devil  which possess'd you before and upon this the Doctor and the good Spirit vanished out of his Sight and an ugly frightful  Devil  remain'd in the Place which grinn'd and threaten'd him in a terrible manner but said nothing to him that the Horrour of the last Spectre frighted him so terribly that he waked out of his Sleep knock'd up the People of the House and told them the  Devil  was in the Room and in a word disturb'd the whole Family the Hostler and a MaidServant sat up with him but saw nothing and in the Morning as soon as it was light he took his Horse and went away  As the Doctor had told my Friend and as he said to the young Man so it was for being terrified to the last Degree with this course Appearance away he went to the Doctor's House in hurry enough  It happen'd that when he came to the House the Doctor was at his Door speaking to somebody that he was just dismissing and the Party went away just as the young Man came up  'Well  says the Doctor  what's the matter now why I did not bid you come till  Friday    'O Sir  says the young Man  but let me speak with you a little upon another Occasion that has happen'd since and I'll wait upon you again about t'other Business on  Friday  as you appointed  'Come come in then  says the Doctor  I believe I know your Business I warrant ye you have been dreaming some frightful thing or other tonight what have you seen the  Devil  in your Sleep you had e'en as good ha' let me have shewn him you  'Why so you have Sir  says he  han't you pray have not you been abroad tonight  'Abroad  says the Doctor  what do'st thou mean by that I am but just out of Bed  'Why Master  says he  han't you been at  Wrootham  tonight  'At  Wrootham  why thou art mad I tell thee I am but just up  'It's no matter for that  says the Man still staring and wild  I am sure I saw you there and spoke to you and you to me  'Come Friend  says the Doctor  I see you are frighted and you have dreamt waking you have dreamt of the  Devil  or of Spirits all Night why thou art not come to thy self yet come let me know the whole Story  'Nay Sir  says the young Man  'tis a plain Case you know the whole Story already as well as I  'Not a Word not I  says the Doctor  I assure you  'Why Sir  says he  han't you told me the very Case han't you told me I have been dreaming  of the  Devil  and seen the  Devil  how can you say you know nothing of it  'Truly  says the Doctor  any one that saw what a Fright you were in last Night without the least Reason and sees how bewilder'd you look now might guess you have been terrify'd in a Dream and that without any Witchcraft or Conjuring in the least But  adds the Doctor  what signifies telling me I know it already If you think fit to tell me the Case well and good if not pr'ythee go about your Business I desire not to meddle with it  'With that he begg'd the Doctor's Pardon and told him if he did not know his Case already he hoped he would not be angry with him for what he had said at least he was sure he would not when he had told him So he gave him the whole Story at large as I have told it you with a great many more Particulars  'Well  says the Doctor  you see there are good and beneficent Spirits in Being who are willing to relieve and extricate us out of Difficulties at least by their good Counsel and Advice and if thou hadst had Courage and Patience to have heard it no doubt you would have had all your Doubts explained and your Questions answer'd and would have had no need to come to me But the  Devil  who you say stood behind and who afterwards appeared terrible and frightful to you prevented your accepting the good Counsel and the Answers which you would have had from the first Appearance and as for my appearing to you depend upon it your Imagination supplied that Part for I have not stirr'd out from home all Night besides a good Spirit might assume a Shape and Appearance like me that it might be more familiar to you  'But Sir  says the young Man  what must I do now if I have rejected this good Offer it may be the same good Spirit will not now resolve me or do any thing for me  'Perhaps it may  says the Doctor  or perhaps I may obtain a Resolution for you are you willing to stay with me now by Daylight  'Ay Sir with all my Heart I'll wait all Day and all Night too now if you please for I am satisfied now that you will do me no hurt  'In short the Fellow's Case was thus Take it in my Friend's own Words again He was desperately in love with a young Gentlewoman in the Country had courted her a long time and gain'd her Goodwill so far at last that they had agreed to be married but on a sudden some other Object had presented to her Friends who had a better Estate than this young Man and he found his Mistress was at first kept up from him and at last that tho' she was at Liberty she was grown cold and indifferent to him and he was half mad with the Disappointment That after this she seem'd a little kinder and told him the Reason of her Coldness but after all that another thing perplexed him and that was That three Nights together he dreamt that he saw a Neighbouring Gentleman kissing his Mistress and in downright  English  lying with her  'This last tormented him and he was so perplex'd between his Love and his Jealousy that he could not rest to this was to be added that tho' his Mistress was kinder to him than before yet her Father had given him a positive Denial and he knew not what to do and for a Direction in this Difficulty he went to the Cunning Man  'Upon these things the Doctor after all the intervening Circumstances which have taken up your time gave him this very good Advice whether  by his Art consulting of Spirits or by what other Method I know not but he deliver'd it to him in this Form or to this Purpose  'Friend  says the Doctor  the Intelligence which I have had relating to thy Affairs from the invisible Regions and by the Aid of those good Spirits which thou art so afraid to receive it from is very kind and favourable to thee if thou art disposed to hearken to good Advice  'The young Woman that thou art so deeply in love with is not dishonest those Dreams thou hadst in Prejudice of thy Affection are injurious and proceed from the grinning angry Spirit which as thou saidst appeared to thee in thy last Night's Disturbance However it would be wisely done if thou wouldst withdraw thy Affection from this Object for I am well assured her Parents who are resolved to dispose of her another way will never favour thee and if thou takest her against their Consent will neither give thee Portion or Blessing nor will thy Marriage be happy  'Ask me not by what Rules I obtain this Information quiet thy Mind in the view of other Offers which may present preserve thy Virtue and Temperance there seems something in View tho' yet at a Distance which shall be more to thy Satisfaction even than this had it gone forward and I see a Light of moderate Happiness glancing towards thee from a remote Part intimating that thou shalt be very happy and live comfortably if the Exercise of a patient and quiet Temper prevail over Rashness and Passion but if the latter prevail expect Misery and distracted Circumstances may be thy Lot  'The Youth went away better instructed than I should have expected from an Art which I have so very bad an Opinion of But this  Dr  Boreman  was a strange Man according to all the Reports of the Country about him and did abundance of things even by the Methods of his Art which carried a Face of Good with them as is said before  Pag  if it was delusive and came from the  Devil  it was so much the more dangerous as it came cover'd and coloured with a Mist of Virtue and a religious Character and with a Mouth always full of a lofty Cant as if talking from a divine Oracle and directed by Spirits always employed for the Good of Mankind in general and to do Acts of Charity and Beneficence to afflicted or perplexed Persons in particular  Thus far from my Friend who conversed with Dr  Boreman  He gave me several other Accounts of him which notwithstanding all the good things pretended to and the fine canting Words of the Doctor convince me still that he must have had some unlawful Conversation with such Spirits or such Beings as I should still call  Devils  That he used Spells and Charms and Familiars that he did not disown the Appearance of Spirits to him assuming visible Bodies was it seems well known and that he had several Books of Magical Experiments I have heard it also well attested whether there were any wicked Magical Performances in those Books or not I cannot tell  It is true or else general Report must lye most unusually that he did perform several strange things yet they say he was never known to do or direct the doing any Mischief or to encourage any injurious thing It was usual as they report of him to set Spells for the Country People for the preserving their CherryGardens from being plunder'd and their Orchards from being robb'd Take some of the Tales which pass for creditable as follows  That three young Fellows being gotten into an Orchard which I suppose was under his particular Care he caused a large Bell to hang to the Heel of their Shoes behind like a Heelspur by which they alarm'd the House and raised the People who surrounding the Orchard took them all when they were taken the Bells being to be pull'd off could not be seen and yet the Sound of them was heard all the Way they went to the Justice of the Peace till he committed them and then ceased  Another time some Boys being gotten into a CherryGarden and one of them being up a CherryTree he made the Boy see a great Mastif Dog sitting at the bottom of the Tree waiting for his coming looking him full in the Face and grinning and snarling at him if he offer'd to stir so that the poor Boy not daring to come down was oblig'd to sit in the Tree 'till he cry'd out for Help by which means the People of the House came and found him in the Tree and as soon as they were come he could see no more of the Dog neither could any body see it but himself  The Methods he took with lewd People of those Times were it seems exceeding many and such that as the Landlord told my Friend the young Wenches stood in awe of him and were terrified with the very Name of him  No petty Thefts but he would discover them even after they were committed and if we may believe common Fame if People's Cattle were gone astray he would tell them which Way to look for them Whether he could ha' told  Saul  how to find his Father's Asses I cannot say But I dare affirm he could not have told him of the Kingdom as  Samuel  did  And yet this Dr  Boreman  as they say would not suffer any such thing as a Witch to live in the Country but exposed and detected them on all occasions and the wicked Spirits on all occasions fled from him as was reported of the House which they said was haunted  How to reconcile this to a Correspondence of  Devils  only I cannot say and yet that Magick Powers are communicated by good Angels and by divine Appointment I can see no Reason to suggest but the contrary seems to be evident by the People of  Ephesus  coming and bringing their conjuring Books and burning them upon receiving the Christian Faith by the preaching of the Apostle  Paul  to the Value of fifty thousand Pieces of Silver  There are abundance of Books upon this Subject left by this Dr  Boreman  and some  as they say  with Rules of Art as they are called but they are kept so up in private Hands that I do not find they are to be come at by any means The Works of the right famous Enthusiast  Jacob Behemen  seem to be of the same kind tho' something more refin'd and less rational being all in the Clouds and Confusion  This  Jacob Behemen  took it very ill to be called a  Magician  but he was a kind of a Visionist He pretended to see things invisible and hear things unutterable and I might add he seemed to have some Truth in it for he published things unintelligible  His Writings are either Magick or Enthusiastick or rather both for I never met with many that would pretend to understand them and never with one that was the better for them except it was one very particular Man among his Admirers who declared himself to be the better for them only and for that very Reason  namely  because he did not understand them  Now that I may not seem to pass my Censure rashly I desire that my more intelligent Readers will please to reduce the following things into Meaning if they can and favour us with the Interpretation being some particular Account of the Life of this famous religious Ingineer for I know not what else to call him and the Titles of some of his Books  By the Differences and Controversies in Religion which he knew not how to satisfy himself in he was stir'd up and moved to  ask seek  and  knock  that he might know the  Truth    Upon which by the  Divine Drawing  and  Will  he was in Spirit wrapt up into the  Holy Sabbath  in which he remained seven whole Days by his own Confession in  highest Joy  After he came to himself he laid aside the Folly of Youth and was driven by  divine Zeal  earnestly to reprehend  impudent scandalous  and  blasphemous  Speeches and did forbear in all his Actions the least Appearance of Evil and continued to get his Living  by the Labour  of his Hands 'till the Beginning of the  Sixth Seculum  which was the Year when he was the second time possess'd with a  Divine Light  and by the Sight of a  sudden Object  was brought to the  inward Ground  or  Center  of the  hidden Nature    Yet somewhat doubting he went out into an open Field and there beheld the miracul'us Works of  the Creator  in the  Signatures  and  Figures  of all created things manifestly laid open whereupon he was taken with an exceeding Joy  yet held his Peace in Silence praising GOD    But ten Years after in the Year thro' the  overshadowing  of the holy Spirit he was a third time  touched  by  GOD  and renewed  and became so enlighten'd that least  so great Grace  bestowed upon him should slip out of his Memory and he resist his God he wrote privately for himself without the Help of any Books but the holy Scriptures many Books such as these  A Book of the Signature of all things  A Consolatory Book of the Four Complexions  A  Misterium magnum  upon  Genesis    A Book of Theosophick Questions  Certain Letters to divers Persons at certain times with certain Keys for some hidden Words  These learned Labours of this right learned Enthusiast may for ought I know be still extant they are recommended here for their extraordinary Titles and I believe are much about as intelligible as the above Rhapsody of his Life to all which I recommend the curious Reader if he has a mind to embarrass his Understanding for an Age or two and come out as wise as he went in The Specimen I think to be much of a Piece with the good Dr  Boreman  only with this specifick Difference  viz  that Friend  Jacob  carries us up into the Clouds to understand things there if any body there may be found to teach us and Dr  Boreman  was for bringing the Clouds down to us to reach us what we could understand nothing of when we were taught  Thus you have the two invisible and unintelligible Brothers together whether they have left any to carry on the unmeaning Magick I know not  There have been some Pretenders to the Art who have succeeded the Doctor but we see nothing of their Performance at least not equal to his Let us look a little higher  CHAP IV  Of the Doctrine of Spirits as it is understood by the Magicians How far it may be supposed there may be an Intercourse with Superior Beings without any Familiarity with the  Devil  or evil Spirits with ae Transition to the present Times  WHEN the seven Sons of  Scaeva  the  Jew  pretended to Exorcism and to cast the  Devil  out of a possess'd Person the  Devil  taking it in scorn to be affronted by meer Pretenders and disdaining those that had no Authority to make use of the Names which he was subjected to the Terror of flew upon them  as the Text says  in a Rage  Jesus  I know and  Paul  I know  says he  but  who are ye  and he never left them till they fled away from him naked and wounded  Now in what Name or by what Authority Dr  Boreman  or any of these Magicians dismissed the  Devil  from haunted Houses chased away Spi  its from the Places where they had made any Appearance and kept the  Devil  in such Awe as is re  orted I cannot yet learn Had the Doctor really cast the  Devil  out of any Demoniack or possess'd Person and openly have exercised such an absolute Power over him and had it been well vouch'd by Persons of known Integrity and sound Judgment we must then have believ'd that there were some good Spirits some superior intelligent Beings whom the Doctor was so favoured by that know  ng his good Intentions they would assist him with their Aid against the evil Spirits  But there are innumerable Difficulties in the Way the Words of our Saviour are express that  this Kind goeth not out but by Prayer and Fasting  and I do not read much of the Doctor being a Person so pious and so religious as to exercise himself that way at all what he might do in private I know not but by all I can learn he acted as by the immediate Deputation of those good Spirits intimating that they brought him Intelligence that they acquainted him with the Circumstances of every enquiring Person that they directed him what Answers to give that he was but as i  were their Messenger to evil Spirits ordering them to remove from such and such Places tha  they empower'd him by speaking such and such Words to charm and bind down such People a  he was directed to operate upon to such a Limit  and within such a Circle of Ground  But all this is still attended with this Doubt  viz▪  That the Fact is not proved let us see therefor  what it is likely these good Spirits can do an  what they really are believ'd to do in any Part o  the World for the general Good of Mankind  That there are some Appearances in the World and that of such Spirits as we may call Good  will not deny here whether I grant it at presen  or no The People in  Norway  tell you of a goo  Spirit which at all times gives People Notice o  things fatal and destructive that it appears in  flying Ball of a yellowish green and is seen in th  Air and will knock at their Doors before approach+ing Tempests and deep Snows that they may sa  their FishingBoats by hauling them up upon th  Shores or into narrow safe Creeks where they w  receive no Damage and that on Shore they m  bring home their Cattle and secure them from tho  deep Snows and severe Colds  In  Laponia  we are told of several Spirits which they converse with not by way of Witchcraft and Sorcery but which they call their good Spirits and whom they consult with upon every urgent Occasion for Relief and Assistance and who never do any Hurt to them or to their Cattle What the  Lapland  Witches may do I know not neither is it my present Inquiry  Whether these good Spirits are not those who at the Request of some certain People on all the Coasts of  Norway  are said to procure fair Winds for Ships going to Sea I will not undertake to say But this I have upon strict Enquiry learnt  First  That it really is so in Fact that upon going to certain People there and upon paying them a small Consideration not above two Dollars they have been assured of a fair Wind exactly at such a Time from such a certain Point of the Compass and to last so many Hours as has been agreed for  Secondly  That this has been agreed for when the Winds have been as the Seamen call it set in  to blow Trade  from a directly contrary Point and for a considerable time before and that when they have gone away and declined the Agreement they have lain a long time without a fair Wind till complying and again that upon so complying they have never sailed  Thirdly  That if you offer to desire or give Money to them to raise a high Wind that is a Storm they will be very angry refuse your Money with Disdain and ask you in their Language if you think they deal with the  Devil  that their Power comes from a good Spirit that never does any Hurt in the World but always does things kind and good and for the Benefit of Mankind  All our Accounts Histories and Relations concerning the Northern Parts of  Britain  are full of he Appearance of Spirits to the Inhabitants on  sundry Occasions and yet none of those Spirits are hurtful to them or join in any hurtful things  Either these Spirits inhabit in the Regions of the Air and so are near us and take Cognizance of our Persons and Affairs or they do not if they do not what do they appear for if they take cognizance of us and of our Affairs and yet do None Hurt then they are not  Devils  tho' Spirits for the  Devil  would certainly do the utmost Mischief he could on the contrary those Spirits do eminent good Services on sundry Occasions to Mankind they must therefore be supposed at least to be good and beneficent Beings inhabiting somewhere in the vast Expanse of Space which we call the Habitation of Spirits or the invisible World  And this leads us by the Hand to that hitherto unintelligible thing called the Secondsight that is to say that those good Spirits make themselves visible to some particular Persons and represent to them the Form or Shadow of this or that Person that they have a mind to have seen and even those Persons are represented not to do them Hurt but oftentimes to warn of approaching Mischief Death or Danger  To what purpose should the  Devil  who is never guilty of doing Good except with design of Evil I say to what purpose should he foretell Evils awaiting this or that Man who cares not what Evil may or can befall him to represent to him things in Effigie which shall yet come to pass in Reality to give him warnings of Evils in time that he may avoid it This is not like the  Devil  who is always seeking Man's Destruction For Example  The Secondsighted Highlander sees a young Lady with three Gentlemen standing at her right Hand intimating that they should every one of them in their Turn be her Husband and however unlikely this comes to pass He sees the like  number of Women standing on the left hand of a Man and he is directed by this to know they shall all be his Wives the very Faces and Habits of them are described and that so as to have them known and this tho' seeming at first ridiculous comes to pass A Secondsight Man travelling on the Road sees a Man on Horseback at a great distance coming towards him a great River being between them He says to his Friend that was with him  Ride forward to the River Bank and you may chance save the Man's Life for he will pass the Ford but will be driven away by the Water and you may chance assist him to get out    The Man to whom it was said gallop'd up to the River's Brink and calls to the Man on the other Side bidding him not come forward for the River at the Ford was newly risen and the Water or the Current would be too strong for his Horse adding that he would be in Danger  I know the Ford  says he  better than you mind your own Affairs  and with that comes on and enters the River and was accordingly driven away with the Current and in great Danger but the Man sent to warn him was so careful that running on the other side of the River he had an Opportunity to throw a Rope to him which at last he took hold of and with great Difficulty is drawn to the Shore and in that manner his Life was saved  Now tho' it is true that the Intelligence which this Man gave was the saving the Man's Life yet they will have it that this Man dealt with the  Devil  How else say they should this Man know that the other Man a Stranger to him should be in Danger But I answer that the  Devil  has no Knowledge of Futurity and therefore this could not be the  Devil  or from the  Devil    Besides why should the Devil tell the Man and warn him of the Danger of passing the River would he not much rather that the Man should have been drown'd and as many more as he could  'Tis evident that in Witchcrafts and familiar Spirits where the  Devil  acts by the Agency of the Witch or Wizard they are always fam'd for doing Mischief prompting to all manner of Evil tormenting the particular People they are empower'd to act upon murthering others destroying Cattle setting Fire to Houses Ships Stacks of Corn or Hay and in a word every thing hurtful and every thing hateful  There is some Reason therefore certainly to distinguish between those Spirits who are kind and careful and assistant to Mankind and those that are mischievous destructive and declare themselves Enemies to the comm  n Good The Last are evidently of Hell the very Na  ure of the  Devil  appears in all their Actions and in the Ends and Aims of all the Emissaries they employ What contrary Judgment is to be made from contrary Effects remains to be consider'd  They both act at least we understand them to act by the Assistance of some invisible Spirit or as it may be more properly expressed the invisible Spirits act in them and by them  As to Witchcraft and Possession that I thi  k is plain and needs no Discourse upon it 'tis known to be all from an evil Spirit or in  English from the  Devil  There is no Room to dispute i  the Wretches employed acknowledge it  d the Hellish things they do discover it so w  ed say no more of that nor is it the Business  fore me  But who is it that acts these other sorts of People what Spirits inform them what secret Power opens their Eyes to see things hid from the rest of  Mankind I meet with many that have examined into this Matter of the Secondsight and who have discoursed with the People who are what shall I call it I can hardly say Blessed with it neither do they call it so themselves and all that I have enquired of about it seem only to hold up their Hands with a kind of Astonishment at the thing but can give no Account of it they wonder at but do not understand it  To me 'tis more a Wonder that it should not be understood for it seems to be nothing more or less than this That supposing an invisible World or World of Spirits as we have already been discoursing and have in part granted I say supposing there are such Spirits and that they inhabit the invisible Regions how near to or remote from us we know not and that the Reality of their Existence is certain this Secondsight then is accounted for thus  Two Ways those Spirits find to converse with Mankind be it for Good or Evil that's a Question by it self I say they maintain an Intercourse with Mankind two Ways  First  By immediate personal and particular Converse with this or that Man and by such particular Methods as is only known to the Person whether by the Means of any Science or Art or otherwise we know not this we call Magick and the Man so conversing with them we call a Magician  Secondly  Or these Spirits acting at a distance render themselves visible and their Transactions perceptible to such and such particular Persons and on such Occasions as they think fit and as they find needful without any farther Concern or Acquaintance with the Person or communicating to him or them any thing of the Reason or Nature of the Discovery or any Knowledge of the Person so making the Discovery and this is what we foolishly enough call the Secondsight  Nor is this Notion in any thing inconsistent either with Reason or the Nature of the thing the Angel that stood with the flaming Sword in his Hand was seen by the Ass of  Balaam  and not seen by his Master Our Saviour in his glorified State after his Resurrection was seen and conversed with in the openest and freest manner imaginable by the two Disciples going to  Emaus  and yet they knew not who it was and as soon as they knew him he became invisible to them again  Now suppose one of these invisible Inhabitants designs to make itself visible either to discover such or such an Evil at hand to particular Men or to warn this or that Person of Mischief attending another so that he may immediately go and prevent it Can we think it difficult for that Spirit to make itself visible to this or that particular Man and not to another I think there is nothing strange at all in it  A Secondsighted Man going towards a Gentleman's House in  Bradalbin  sees the Gentleman towards whose House he was going riding on the Road with a neighbouring Gentleman whom he also knew attended with three Servants on Foot and one on Horseback six in all then he suddenly sees a Troop of Highland Robbers forty or fifty in Number rushing out of a Wood or some other Place where they lay in Ambush who surrounded the Gentlemen dismounted and robb'd them wounded the first Gentleman in the Arm and killed one of the Servants  The Man going forward to the Gentleman's House just in the Court or Entry before his House sees the Gentleman with the other Gentleman his Friend mounting his Horse to ride abroad and the Servants attending just three in Number besides the Gentleman's Steward on Horseback  He immediately speaking to one of the Servants enquires which way their Master was travelling they answer him that he is going to  Innerlochy  upon such and such Business Which Way does the Laird intend to take says the Man Such a  Gat  says the Servant I beseech his Honour says the Man that he go not by that  Gat  that is to say by that Road for if he does he will fall into bad Hands  The Servant tells his Master and he calls the Stranger and asks him what he meant by telling him so Sir says he I tell it for good if your Honour please to hearken to it For if you go by that  Gat  mentioning the Road which his Servant had nam'd you will fall in with the Robbers who haunt those Hills and will be overpower'd and mischiev'd  What says the other Gentleman that was to go with him mocking at the secondsighted Man are ye one of those FoolBodies a  Scots  Expression that they call SEERS ha' ye been seeing a Vision this Morning Pr'ythee how many were they and what did they say to you  An your Honour will gang says the Man gang your wa But you will remember what I have told you when ye find it true  The first Gentleman answer'd Were they a Troop say you Yes and't please your Honour says the Man  Well well says the Gentleman I shall go an a Troop of Devils were in the Way So the Man was flouted on all Hands and went his way back the two Gentlemen went on as they said they would and were attack'd and robb'd one Servant kill'd and one of the Gentlemen had his Arm broke with a PistolBullet and was brought back the same Day to his own House  What Spirit it must be that could thus form an Appearance of things that would come to pass that we cannot determine but supposing this Story to be true in Fact as many such have been this had certainly one Token of a good Spirit in it namely that it gave the Gentleman fair Warning to shun the Danger that awaited him and as it were sent an Express to him from the invisible World which if he had not despised he might have escaped and avoided the Danger  Now had this been the  Devil  if I have any Notion of the  Devil  and of his Nature as well as Designs his Part w  uld rather have been to have sent an Agent of his  the Troop of Robbers his Friends to give them Notice that such a Gentleman and such another with him was coming upon the Way and that in such a Place they should be sure to meet and surprize them He would have been so far from warning the Gentlemen of their Danger that he would have run them into it with all the Artifice he was Master of and I will not say that he did not prompt the two Gentlemen above to scoff and flout at the poor secondsighted Man and make a Jest of his Intelligence as you have heard that so they might go on and fall into the Danger they were warned against rather than go another Way and avoid it  Some of these informing Spirts think fit to appear themselves to these secondsighted People and not to others and if the Author of the Description of the Western Islands of  Scotland  may be credited who also names not the Circumstances only but the Persons they have not only abundance of these secondsighted People there but they have abundance of things discover'd to them in this Manner and especially upon the approaching Death or Disasters of any Person or Family It is true the Examples he brings are most  of them trifling but we have many Relations in that Country generally received for Truth which are considerable and divers Examples are to be had which are new and without Precedent nothing is more frequent among them than that of Foretelling the Death of any Person some Examples of which I can give of my own Knowledge  I was at a Gentleman's House in this Town near St  James  's and he happen'd to have some Friends invited to his House that Day upon an Entertainment the Occasion of which I do not just now remember Among the Guests at his Table was an ancient Gentlewoman and her Daughter a fine beautiful young Lady and was I think to be marry'd the next Week or within a very few Days There sat opposite to her another Lady of what Country I do not remember but she was a Foreigner and I think was a  Dutch  Woman but appear'd as a Person of good Figure  This Foreigner it seems came to the Gentleman's House not as invited to the Entertainment but upon some Business of Consequence Dinner being just ready he ask'd her to stay and told her they would dispatch their Business afterwards and so led her in among the Ladies  After Dinner the Gentleman and this Foreign Lady withdrew to dispatch their Affair which was something relating to the  Exchequer  where he had an Employ and in Discourse she said to him Pray Mr who is that elderly Lady that sat opposite to me so he told her the Lady's Name and that young charming Lady is her Daughter I suppose says she Yes says the Gentleman Poor Lady  says she  I am very sorry for her for that her Daughter is a most beautiful Creature indeed and I see she is very fond of her 'tis a sad thing What d'ye mean says the Gentleman Why says she the young Lady won't live above a Fortnight and the  poor Lady her Mother will almost break her Heart for her I am very sorry  The Gentleman who told me Story with his own Mouth was extreamly surpris'd at what she said and would fain have understood it as if she jested with him but she affirm'd it seriously and shew'd so much Concern at it that he could not carry it off for a Jest then he ask'd her how she knew it I see it upon her says she I wish I could show it you I tell you she is a dead Woman all the World can't save her for her Hour is come ask me no more Questions My Friend told me the Story immediately the Concern about it had almost frighted him and the Event answer'd it all in about three Days the young Lady was taken very ill which turn'd to a Vomiting and that to a Fever and she dy'd on the very fourteenth Day afterward  Another time walking in a Friend's Garden near  London  there was a young Gentlewoman walking in the next Garden and there being but a low Wall between and a Mount on that Side where we were we could see her walking with her Father on one side of her and a Sister on the other said one Gentleman that was with me Who is the middlemost Person of those three we told him she was the Gentleman's Daughter who walk'd by her  Has she been sick said he Now it was true that the Lady had been very ill and was come into the Country for Air and we told him how it was Well says he the Air won't recover her for she will dye within a very few Days I earnestly press'd him to tell us how he knew it he answer'd ambiguously a good while but as I press'd him with great Importunity he told me seriously Said he you cannot see it as I do I wish I could not see things so as I do but her Face now at this Instant is to me exactly what you call  a Death's Head    that is the Skeleton of a Head or Scull and no other  The thing was right and the young Woman died within a Week after  But to return to the Subject As these Spirits we may suppose can make any Representations of things visible and that to whom they please so it may be supposed they can make themselves visible also when and to whom they please and this is attested by many Witnesses and evidenced by several differing Circumstances of which I have by Enquiry met with a great many in my time  In the Highlands and Islands they tell you of a Spirit which the poor ignorant Country People call  Browny  or  Bronne  as it seems was the more ancient Name they gave it as the  Norwegians  have another whom they call  Bielke    Much Pains has been taken to examine who this  Browny  is and whether he is a good Spirit or a bad but most of the Stories I meet with are so fabulous or trifling or ridiculous that I rather take the Appearance to be imaginary than real If it be real it must be some lowpriz'd Spirit employed among the meanest of People and on the meanest Occasions scarce worth naming and yet most of them rather for evil than good  It is worth observing that where these frequent Appearances are and these secondsighted  Visionists  we rarely hear of any Pawwawing or Conjuring no BlackArtMen very little Magick I fancy it seems rather that what Business these invisible Agents have to do and what Intercourse they carry on with this World they generally do it themselves they are not manag'd by Art or call'd in to the Aid and Assistance of the Artists But as they make things visible at Pleasure they want no Agents they do their own Business their own way and in a word they have no  Magicians  among them  none of those they call Cunning Men or that consult with the invisible World in behalf of others it seems they have no Occasion of such Men they are not so fanciful or overrun with Vapours as we are in this Part of the World  Yet they have some Remains of Sorcery among them too and particularly they are strangely addicted to Charms In the Isles of  Orkney  they use a Charm to stop Bleeding and they tell you it is as effectual as the strongest Stiptick be the Bleeding outward by a Wound or inward by any breaking the Vessels Wrench or Strain or by Distemper and for this they have particular People whom they call Charmers What Part of the Black Art or Magick these Charmers practise I know not but it seems they perform it at a Distance and without seeing or knowing the Persons only the Person who is in Distress by Bleeding sends his Name to the Charmer and he sends the good Spirit he talks of and as the  Magicians  say converses with and the Bleeding is stopt in a Moment This the Charmer as they call him does by repeating the Name of the Person afflicted to which he always adds some barbarous unintelligible Language of his own upon repeating which he sends the Messenger away and the Cure is perfected Now this is much the same with the  Magick  of other Practisers for this they tell you is the Charmer's speaking to the good Spirit he converses with who immediately flyes invisible to the poor distress'd Patient and works the Cure  These Charms are also of several Kinds and for several Purposes some to cure humane Bodies some to cure Cattle some to quiet great Dogs and prevent their falling upon People as they go along and some perhaps to prevent their Barking when a Thief may attempt the House that Part I suppose they won't call the Work of a good Spirit  They have such a Variety of those things in other Parts as well as in our own Country and especially in  Ireland  in  Norway  and in some Parts of  Germany  that it would be needless to give an Account of them and a little out of the way too in such a Work as this  But I must come a little nearer home These Arts are used more on this side the World as the rendring darker things visible seems to be more the case on that side and as I am enquiring rather what our  Magicians  practise without the  Devil  than what the  Devil  or any other Spirit practises without the  Magician  I come to bring all these things down to your immediate Understanding  We have been diving into Mysteries long enough and been serious till perhaps you are tir'd for a little grave doings wearies us at this time of day let us see if the Subject will afford us any Diversion The Age is witty beyond measure and not a little wicked too but whence is it that we have no Magick in our Wit It is not many Years ago since the sprightly Part of human Wit relish'd with Mankind and Men were bright by meer Inspiration the good Spirits if such there are dictated things of Value to the Minds of Men they convers'd in the very Confines of the mysterious World but without Raptures and Agitations they had the Sublime without the Infernal the Humid without the Horrid they had the Fire without the Brimstone they could laugh without Baudy and jest without Blasphemy talk without Buffoonry and vote without Bribery write without Pedantry and read without Party  But now bless us all how strangely is the Course of things chang'd what with good Spirits and bad Spirits we do every thing without Spirit we are all Magick and no Witchcraft the  Devil  without the  Devil  we laugh without a Jest and jest  without Wit we write without Sense and read without Taste we are lewd beyond Whoredom and devout beyond Religion we preach without Doctrine are religious without Principles pray without Doxology and worship without a God  Now how shall we do to find out the Magick of all this 'tis certainly brought about by some strange Fascination some Devilisme that we feel and don't see Here must be some Intercourse between us and the invisible World tho' I doubt 'tis some of the darker Part of it Every Man seems to me to have his Daemon of a particular kind proper and separate to himself by which he either governs himself or is govern'd I know not well which to call it and so he walks on in his own way follows no body and leads no body but is a Principle a Doctrine a Governor nay a God to himself  Formerly the Broachers of Errors and particular Notions had always their Disciples and Followers and they judged pretty much of the goodness or badness of the Doctrine whether Religious Philosophic or Moral by the Number and Quality of the Followers they had even the  Jews  did thus of our Saviour  Have any of the Elders or of the Rulers believed on him  But now  God save us  so many Men so many Maggots  Tot Homines Tot Di s  every Man broaches his own Opinions preaches them to himself is his own Convert his Soul is the Disciple of his Fancy and his Senses the Pulpit of his Humour as for other People as he teaches no body so he scorns to be taught by any body and bids God da him if he had not rather go to the  Devil  than not go to Heaven his own way  Thus we live in a general Disguise and like the Masquerades every Man dresses himself up in a particular Habit not two appear alike in the whole  Place and that the Simily may be perfect the Humour carries it on to the minutest Part as the Habits are not alike so they are always particularly remarkable for being directly opposite to the Person they cover the Phlegmatic dresses  à la Sanguine  the Sober mimicks the Drunkard the Chaste chuses to dress  à la Courtisane  the Atheist puts on the  Religieuse  the Christian has the Vest and the Turban and the Quaker a Habit from the Theatre  In the Appearance of the superior Part it is much the same Mimickry and opposite Capacities engross Conversation the Beau turns Polemic the Atheist disputes Principles the Actress practises Modesty and the Pedant panegyricks upon Wit Fools write Satyr as Clowns teach Manners the Fops are the Men of Weight and since by Accident Wit and Sense appear'd under the Title of the TATTLERS the eternal Clang of TeaTable TATTLE has rung the Changes upon Scandal and set up for the universal Censors of Conversation  And need we go any farther now for our Enquiries after  Magick  could things take such a Turn as this without a general Converse with the World of Spirits will any Man tell me this could happen by the Nature of things or even by the Things of Nature No no invisible Operations are acted from an invisible World the  Magicians  are in the right all the great things they do could never be done without an Intercourse with a superior Rank of Beings be they Infernal or what other  Devils  you please to call 'em  Take a few bright Doings for Examples Upon what foot does the bright Lord sit every Morning over his Chocolate talking upon all the Works of the Learned himself Unlearned to a Scandal And how goodnatur'd and wellmanner'd is the Age  hat no body laughs at him till he is gone or forbears  it afterwards How wise are his Remarks how just his Reflections when he talks so much and understands so little that it may be truly said no wise Man talks like him In which however his Lordship had this Happiness that he chose to take it for a Compliment instead of a Satyr  Sir  Timothy TitlePage  is an admirable Gentleman his Knowledge of the first Leaf of every thing compleatly covers his Ignorance of the Inside of any thing His just Character is so true a Picture of the Age that you need go no farther for a Reason why Nonsense bears such a Price and the Booksellers Trade is so much improv'd seeing they buy most Books that read least and that according to the famous Dr  Salmon  the having a good Library makes a Man a Doctor However Sir  Timothy  no doubt understood the Names of Authors and had as good a local Memory as to the Editions of Books as most Men that could not read  Latin  Nor was he ever out in his Judgment that I have heard of till an unlucky  LinnenDraper  ask'd him once concerning the Learned Author called  Crocus  and  Hinderlands  are two particular sorts of coarse  Germany  Linnen which are Imported by the  Hamburgh  Merchants and ar  known to every  Draper    Crocus  upon  Hinderlands  who the Knight presently own'd but unluckily forgot that the Impression was made in  Germany  and that the Books came over not in Quires but in Rolls from  Bremen  and  Hamburgh    The Happy Miserable Generous Cynical Goodnatured out of Humour Bart Sir would be approv'd by Somebody if he was not laught at by Every body he might sometimes pass for pleasant if he was not always surly and to like something only that he dislikes every thing He sets up for a Critick with this unhappy Addition to his Profession that he alters every thing and mends  nothing How unanswerable a Demonstration is this extraordinary Genius of the Influence of the Invisible World upon the Affairs of Mortals here seeing if he had less than a hundred thousand Devils in him he could never carry on the Practice of an universal Pedant without being whip'd out of Human Society for a Scandal to the very ABC and to turn the Poet's Words a little awry for him  Fellows that ne'er were heard or read of  Would long ere this have wrote his Head off  Roch  to  Shadwel    The Ladies afford us an infinite Variety and to inspect their Share in the Magick of this Age's Management would take up a Volume by it self In a word they are all  Magicians  and I won't take upon me to say that as Witchcraft generally speaking has for some Ages been engross'd by the Sex and the Possession chiefly lay among the Matrons  hat is to say that none but old Women were Witches So now the same Sex seem to have engrossed the sacred Sciences and the Magick lies in  hort all among the Ladies Who shall enter into  he Description of it The Magick of their Wit O how Subtle the Magick of their Beauty how  xquisitely Newfashion'd and the Magick of their Tongues how charmingly Loud not to say Sono  us and Musical  To make these Beauties of the Sex the more dif  usive in their brightest Qualifications and infi  itely more so than was possible in former Ages we have three new invented Colleges of Wit and  ood Manners where the Ladies receive daily Ad  ition to their Ordinary Acquirements and which  e them infinite Advantage over the past Days of  eir Ancestors Grandmothers and in the fre  ent Access to which they must necessarily  excel all that went before them These are the TeaTable the Assembly and the Masquerade at the first they learn to be Lightheaded at the second to be Lighthearted and if at the third they don't learn to be Lightheel'd the Defect must lie somewhere else than in the laudable Endeavours of those that set them up in so many Parts of this newlyreform'd Nation whose Endeavours for the publick Good can never be enough commended either in Print or in Manuscript  I have had some Thought to enquire among al  the real  Magicians  of the Times and especially o  the more Eminent Pretenders about  Baldwin'sGardens WhiteCrossAlley OldStreet WhiteChappel  c and to get Intelligence from the invisibl  World concerning this Important Question Whe+ther any of the good Spirits or bad Spirits th  white  Devils  or black  Devils  or whatever Spi+rits they were which formerly inspir'd the  Roch  +sters  the  Dorsets  and  Drydens  of the last Ages an  yet in Being And if they are what has been the Occa+sion that they have withdrawn the Spirit of Poetr  from the  English  World That not only the Fire extinguish'd and the genial Inspiration decay'd but that the relish of true Poesy is lost That there is nothing perform'd that will bear readin  so no Readers that can taste a Performance eve  the exalted Merit of the greatest Men is sung Notes without Musick Lines without Meanin  Words without Energy Verse without Poetr  and Poetry without Spirit  I wonder sometimes that the great Men  or M  +rather  who we see daily Persecuted by the horr  Jingle I think I should say Jangle of their Rhi  +ing Expectants and Dependents do not consider paying their Debts I mean their poetical Debts  kind  and give the poor versifying  Devils  now and th  a Distich at least in Ballance of their volumino  Labours if they paid but after the rate of publick Interest but three  per Cent  it would at least in time reduce the Debt and might in the mean time lay the Foundation of a good  Sinking Fund    If they do not think of this or some other way for Pensions will rather encrease the Number and like Sweatmeats draw the Flyes about them I say if they do not think of some such way they may I think justly swear the Peace against the Assailants and safely affirm that they go in Danger of being Panegyrick'd to death by 'em For in short such writing is little less in my Opinion than a poetical Assassination and the Ministers are in Danger of dying the Death of  Edward  V and being smother'd with Featherbeds  Heavens deliver every honest Statesman from the insupportable Burthen of Panegyrick especially where 'tis attended with two Negatives want of Money and want of Wit the last makes the first lamentable but the first makes the last unsufferable the first is  piteous  the last is  pitiful  the first is afflicting the last tormenting the first importunate but the last impertinent and as a wise Giver would give any thing to be deliver'd from them so a wise Receiver would rather decently starve than to receive at the Price of being a Plague to the bountiful Hand and of being reliev'd as the unjust Judge reliev'd the Widow to be rid of her  As for the poetical Gentlemen themselves I think it may be said of them with respect to their Magick as was said of a late Author of a Quadruple Performance with respect to his Merit namely that there might be some in his Poverty but there was none at all in his Poetry  In my Opinion however there is a great deal of Magick or Black Art or call it dealing with the  Devil  if you will that Poetical Dregs should regale  the Age If they were sent to the  Druggists  and sold there for Emeticks or made up in Lotions and given for Glisters I should not doubt their effectual Operation But that they should be paum'd upon us for Wit By  Jove  and all the Hellborn Clan of Deities I think the Authors like Coiners of Counterfeit Money should be drawn hang'd and quarter'd for HighTreason against the Peace of their Sovereign Lord King  Drama  his Crown and Dignity  Where's the Cadence the Propriety the Plot the Genius not to say any thing of the Wit in any one Play written for these two or three or four last Reigns The Drums and Trumpets of the War the Broadsides of the Fleets at  Barfleur  and  La Hogue  together with the more terrible Clamours of the Street Mobs and all the  ceteras  of Parties Rabbles Riots and Rebellions quite silenc'd the Muses struck them Dumb and I am told they could never make any Musick since no not all Nine of them put together  Now we talk of the Black Art of Magick of raising Spirits of having an Intercourse with superior Beings and the like I think the Art of our Days the Magick of this Age has been exercis'd to lay the Spirits not raise them to sink the  Devil  of Wit not lift him up and if they have any Intercourse with the invisible World it must be among the inferior Beings not the Superior if they know any Degrees among the Seraphick Train Certain it is the Impetuosity of our Wit has for some Years been all let off in Squibs and Crackers and so like the lesser Volcano's of  Lipary  and  Strombolo  have given Vent to the Subterraneans of Sulphur and Nitre while the Quantity was moderate Whereas when the luxuriance of Wit overpower'd those smaller Eruptions then Mount  Gibello    Aetna  and  Vessuvius  roar'd aloud and overrun all the Country  with a Torrent of liquid Fire Where then is the Fire which once flam'd in this Hemisphere Those Comets in Wit which blaz'd in their several Orbits are disappear'd and when the Revolution of their Spirits shall be visible again what Astronomer what Calculator can inform us not all the  Newtons  the  Whistons  or  Halleys  in the Nation can solve this Difficulty  What  Magician  now can bring us to an Intercourse with those departed Wits or assist us in the bringing them to converse with us again If there is an Acquaintance with this World of Spirits let us call upon the Sons of Art to exert their Utmost and bring those good Spirits again in play and to restore the Commonwealth of Wit that the newfashion'd Ribaldry which the World now relishes for Wit and the Dogmatick which upon the strictest View of our other Performances the utmost Perfection of them may receive their due Censure to the Satisfaction of all the true Masters of common Sense and the due Mortification of the voluminous Scriblers of the Age  Pardon me then from the strange turn of Affairs in these Times of ours I say pardon me to look back again a little to the Conjurings and Black Art of the middle Ages of Time especially among those of them who did not pretend to deal with the  Devil  and it will presently bring us to an understanding of things among our selves  After the ancient  Magicians  had tir'd the World with their Tricks and the  Devil  began to fail them except to those who kept an immediate Correspondence with him by way of Familiar there came up a new sort of Magick as well as a new sort of  Magicians  the Case was this  The People it seems began to discover that the  Magicians  having left off that useful and valuable Study of Science call'd the Knowledge of Nature the  Improvement of Art and the Instruction of Mankind in Wisdom and Virtue had turn'd their Hands to a new and inferiour Study that they consulted Daemons and Evil Spirits that they qualify'd themselves by hellish Correspondences to do Mischief instead of doing Good and that in short they dealt with the  Devil  making themselves the Terror instead of the Blessing of Mandind  When this came to be their Character no wonder the People began to be afraid of them to shun and avoid them as a kind of  Devils  themselves so that except a few who kept up their Reputation by a closer and cunninger Manage the People withdrew their Reverence from the  Magicians  till at last the  Devil  was fain to shift Hands too and act by other Instruments or he would have endanger'd his Kingdom in the World  So Monarchs when their Politicks grow stale  Change Measures and by Novelty prevail  Upon this Change of the  Devil  's Measures he frequently found Reasons to change some of his Instruments too and thus from the  Magi  he turn'd over to the Clergy and so as I hinted in its Place the Augurs the Auruspices and the Oracles came in play  Now it happen'd to Satan as it has frequently happens to other mighty Princes and Tyrants in the World that finding his Servants and Statesmen cease to be Popular cease to be the darlings of the People as they used formerly to be he found also a necessity to shift Hands dismiss his Tools and Instruments and take up with others So  Philip  II had as was said eleven new Ministers and Governors in the  Netherlands  but no new Management if any of his Agents and prime Ministers grew odious to the People he valued not disgracing them recalling them exposing  them and turning them out but took care that when another Governor came the Government should be the same And when the Prince of  Parma  who by his Conduct recover'd the whole  LowCountry  Possessions to the Crown of  Spain  would have preserv'd them by his Prudence when he had gain'd 'em by his Valour the  Spanish  Councils which were all for Tyranny and for Cruelty chose to discourage that gallant Prince rather than not carry on their old absolute Dominion So every Governor there if the People complain'd was sure to be turn'd out and yet the next was oblig'd to pursue the same Tyranny 'till they were petition'd out as others had been before them  When Ministers of State  Cease to be popular they know their Fate  The Crafty Tyrant has no more to do  But sacrifice a Favourite or two  The Mobb are easily cajol'd and then  He changes not the Mischiefs but the Men  By this Method as I say the  Devil  pursued his Interest in the World When one Generation grew out of Use out of Fashion and stale he took to another when the Augurs grew stale when the Cheats of the Oracles were expos'd when the Priests could no more predict by the Entrails he sets his Wits to work to find out other Ways and Means for the carrying on his Game as  By a kind of Astrological Magick in which he manag'd with a great deal of Subtilty and Art bringing the Stars and planetary Influences into Play and by an unpractis'd Subtilty the Art was then carried on with Spell and Charm by Words cut in Metals and in Stones divining by the Byril by the Amathyst by the Lustre of the Emerald and the Ruby and by all the old Superstitions brought  into a new Rule of Practice This was call'd the  Talismans  or the Sympathetick Conjuringstone  It would be too tedious for this Work to give a long History of the Delusions and Cheats which the  Devil  put upon Mankind for three or four hundred Years Practice of this kind in the World I shall satisfy my self only to let you see by way of Abrigment what these Talismans were and what the Authors of them pretended take the Description of them as collected from the best Authors thus  '  Talismans  or  Muthalsans  was the Name of certain Magical Figures graved upon Stones or Metals whereof the  Anonymous  Author of a Book entitled the  Talismans Justified  gives this Description The  Talismans  says he is the Seal the Figure the Character or Image of a Celestial Sign Constellation or Planet graved on a Sympathetick Stone or on Metal correspondent to the Star The Effects which were attributed to these Figures are altogether marvellous 'tis said for Example that the Figure of a Lion ingraven on Gold while the Sun is in  Leo  preserves those from the Stone that carry this  Talisman  about them and that that of a Scorpion made under the Sign  Scorpio  secures from the Wounds of that Animal For to give Beauty and Strength of Body they grave the Figure of  Venus  on the first Face of  Libra Pisces  or  Taurus  to purchase Honours and Dignities easily they grave the Image of  Jupiter  that is a Man having the Head of a Ram on Silver or on a white Stone and he that carries this  Talisman  about him will see say they surprizing Effects To be successful in Merchandize and Gaming they represent  Mercury  on Silver to be courageous and victorious they engrave the Figure of  Mars  on the first Face of  Scorpio  to procure the Favour of Kings  they represent the Sun in Likeness of a King sitting on a Throne with a  Lion  at his Side in very fine Gold in the first Face of  Leo  In the Number of  Talismans  are ranked the  Palladium  of  Troy  The  Roman Bucklers  call'd  Ancilia  The fatal Statues of  Constantinople  for the Preservation of that City The Statue of  Memnon  in  Aegypt  which moved and gave Oracles as soon as the Sun was risen The Statue of the Goddess  Fortune  that  Sejanus  had which brought good Luck to those that possess'd it The brazen Fly  Virgil  's golden Leach which hinder'd the Flies from entering  Naples  and destroy'd all the Leaches of a Well in that City The Figure of a Stork which  Apollonius  set up in  Constantinople  to drive away these Animals The Statue of a Knight which serv'd that City as a Preservative against the Plague The Figure of a Serpent in Brass which hinder'd all Serpents from entering into the same Place whence it happen'd that  Mahomet  soon after the taking of  Constantinople  having broken the Teeth of that Serpent a prodigious Number of Serpents came upon the Inhabitants of that City but without doing them any hurt because all their Teeth were broke as were those of the brazen Serpent  '  Talismans  are distinguish'd into three sorts  viz  Astronomical Magical and Mix'd The Astronomical are referred to Signs of Celestial Constellations which are ingraven with other Figures and some intelligible Characters The Magical have extraordinary Figures with Superstitious Words and the Names of unknown Angels The Mix'd are compos'd of Signs and barbarous Names but which are neither superstitious or of unknown Angels They bury them in the Earth or in the Squares of publick Places or they may carry them about them Some have  believ'd that  Apollonius Tyanaeus  was the first Author of the  Talismans  but others are of Opinion that the  Aegyptians  were the Inventers of them which  Herodotus  seems to insinuate in the second Book of his History when he says this People having first of all given Names to the twelve Celestial Gods did likewise engrave Animals on Stones The Inhabitants of the Island of  Samothracia  made  Talismans  with Gold Rings which had Iron set in them instead of Precious Stones  Petronius  speaks of it when he says that  Trimalcio  carried a Gold Ring set with Stars of Iron The Gods which they call'd the Gods of  Samothracia  were those that presided over the Science of the  Talismans  which is confirmed by the Inscriptions of those three Altars whereof  Tertullian  speaks Before the Pillars saith he there are three great Altars dedicated to three sorts of Gods which they call Great and Mighty and Strong and which are believed to be those of  Samothracia Apollonius  makes mention of three  Divinities  to whom he joineth  Mercury  and relateth the barbarous Names of those  Gods  which it was prohibited to reveal  viz Axierus Axiocerso Axiocersus  and  Casmilus  which he says are  Ceres Proserpina Pluto  and  Mercury  The  Aegyptians  from whom the greatest Part of other People have learned the Secret of those Rings had also other  Talismans  for all Parts of the Body And perhaps 'tis for this that we find so many little Figures of  Gods Men  and  Animals  in the ancient Tombs of this Country The most ancient  Talismans  are made upon Plants Branches of Trees or Roots  Josephus  speaks of them in the eighth Book of his Antiquities and attributes the Invention of them to  Solomon  They apply says he to the Nose of the Sick possessed by the Devil a Ring wherein a Root was set  instead of a Stone  Solomon  had taught it in his Works This Historian says that he has even seen the Effects and that a  Jew Eleazer  by Name cured many possessed in this manner in the Presence of the Emperor  Vespasian  The ancient  Aegyptians  believed that certain Stones cut out into Beetles had considerable Virtues to procure Strength and Courage for those that carried them about with them because says  Aelian  this Animal has no Female and is an Image of the Sun They put likewise sometimes the Figures of Frogs in  Talismans  and  Pliny  testifies that if we believe those that improve that Science a parcel of Frogs ought to be esteemed more significant in a Commonwealth than a body of Laws  Aelian  says that those of  Aegypt  took a Reed which preserved them from being devoured by Adders or Crocodiles of the  Nile  and that they are the Emblem of Wisdom and Prudence  '  Tzetzes  relateth that a Philosopher put a Stop to a Plague at  Antioch  by a  Talisman  of Stone wherein there was the Head of  Charon  graved  Apollonius  made use of the Figures of  Storks  and  Serpents  and the  Aegyptians  commonly made use of the Figures of  Serapis  of  Canopus  God of the  Aegyptians  of the  SparHawk  and  Asp  against the Evils which might come from the four Elements Earth Water Air and Fire  The modern  Talismans  are not so curious as the ancient and we may know them by the Characters which are purely  Arabick Turkish  or of other Oriental Tongues The principal Authors that have treated on this Subject in the latter Ages are  Camilli Leonardi  who has writ the Mirror of Stones  Geber Bacon  and  Paracelsus  who have treated of Astrological Magick and of the Sympathy of Stones Metals and Planets  Gaffarel  has compos'd a Book on this Subject intitled  Unheardof  Curiosities And  Agrippa  has treated of it in his Occult Philosophy  Gregory  of  Tours  relateth that the City of  Paris  had been built under a Constellation which preserved it from Conflagration Serpents and Mice and that a little before the Fire that happen'd in the Year they had found in raking up an Arch of a Bridge the two  Talismans  Preservers of that City which were a Serpent and a Mouse of Brass Some have derived the  Arabick  Name  Talisman  from the  Greek  which signifies Preservation We will not spend time to shew the Vanity of the  Talismans  for we live in an Age that is not much addicted to such Superstitions  But these things went but a little way compared to what followed for now the  Pagan  Worship declining the World began to see with other Eyes the  Devil  lost Ground every where and the Christian Religion spread it self insensibly and in a surprising manner especially over all the Eastern and Northern Parts as into  Asia  and into  Germany  and  France  and now it behoved the  Devil  to take new Measures also  Nor was he at all at a Loss for he knew his Method presently and that was to put on the Face of Religion rank in with the sanctifyed Part of the People  to wit  the Clergy and draw them into his Scheme as he had done the Pagan Priests before  Upon this he took up the Tonsure shaved himself for a Monk or a Monkey which you please dress'd himself up in the Habit put on the sacred Vestments and got presently into Orders The Popes quickly fell in with him Pope  Sylvester  II gave him Institution and Induction and from this time forward he quitted the Astrologick and set up an Ecclesiastic  Magick  in the World The Success  has been wonderful beyond even his own Expectation for it must be confessed when the Priests first began a Correspondence with him they outstript him in their Speed for they run even before they were sent St  Francis  and St  Ignatius  outdid all the Arts of infernal Magick that ever were known or in use in the World and with his Assistance did more to establish a Race of Inchanters and Church Magicians in the World than the  Devil  himself could have expected  This served his Interest effectually on one Side of the World that is to say for  Europe  especially and all the Western World And  Confucius  drew out another Plan of Ecclesiastick or rather Philosophick  Magick  for him in  China  and  Japan  But he was still at a Loss for all the rest of  Asia  and  Africa  which we might then call the middle Part of the World and which at that time was ripe for any kinds of Enthusiasm or Church Magick let it be almost what it would  Satan  who always sees his Opportunity and has no want of Vigilance to lay hold of it saw the Occasion but could not readily find out a Handle He could not presently think of a Method 'till at length the industrious  Devil  found out the Contrivance of setting up the Unity against the Trinity the House of  Ishmael  against the House of  Isaac  the Race of the Bondwoman against the Race of the Freewoman the Circumcision against the Baptism and the Magick of  Mahomet  's Pidgeon to mimick the Christian Dove  Having thus settled the Scheme he found out a Tool fit for his Purpose a fierce ignorant  Arabian  bold subtle cruel and merciless to Men insolent and audacious to Heaven who by this meer Magick of Enthusiasm back'd by the Sword and Spear set up the boldest the grossest and the most senseless of all Impostures that ever was in the  World and which yet at this Time and for above a thousand Years past has strangely triumph'd over the Christian World has spread itself over  Asia  and  Africa  from the utmost Islands of  India  East to the utmost Corner of  Africa  to the West and it was 'till within a few Years past Master of a fourth Part of  Europe  besides  Such is the Force of Ecclesiastic Magick and how far it is gone besides this to break into the Ecclesiastic Affairs of the Christian World is not hard to describe tho' it would take up too much Room especially at the Close of this Work to enquire into the Particulars  What a continued Series of Ecclesiastic Magick has been acted among the Romish Clergy and in the whole Papal Hierarchy Even Popery itself seems to me to be one entire System of Antechristian Magick its Constitutions are all Sorcery and Witchcraft they prevail upon Sense by Nonsense upon the Head by the Tail upon Zeal by Enthusiasm and upon the Christian Doctrine by the Doctrine of the  Devil    How could it be possible that Mankind blinded by their own Obstinacy could sink their Reason to erect Notion establish Fraud and Cheat against Christian Sincerity and Plainness make Men refuse to see when their Eyes are open worship Priests in the Name of God and set up Darkness in the room of Light if they were not bewitched with the Magick of Hell and under the entire Management of the  Devil  It would be worth while here to draw a Table of Proportions and let us see how much more fatal to the World this Ecclesiastic Magick of Popery inclusive of a few other spiritual Delusions and Enthusiasms has been than all the Magick of Paganism and all the Conjurations of Hell were before  That Men should renounce the Idols and then worship the Priest condemn Oracles and enquire of the  Devil  cast off the  Baals  the  Jupiters  and the  Saturns  of the Pagans and set up a Breaden God that they should first Worship and then devour  That whole Nations should relinquish the glorious Host of Heaven the much more rational Gods of their Forefathers and empower every Priest to make a God for 'em with half an Ounce of Meal The Clergy were indeed in the right of it so far that they like the Silversmiths of  Ephesus  when they had once drawn the People into this Magick of a Worship took care to engross the Art of making Gods all to themselves  Nor was it the least Part of the Magick of this Contrivance that they should make eating their  God  be a Part of their most solemn Idolatry I cannot call it Worship that when they had made a Bushel or two of Gods and been paid for 'em the People that came to Church might eat 'em up and the Priests be richly set to work to make more  If ever the  Talismans  of the  Greeks  the  Augurs  and  Auruspices  of the  Romans  the Lapdog of  Venutius  or  Mahomet  's Pidgeon could outdo these Delusions of Church Magick I am quite mistaken and shall be ready to acknowledge it  That Men should sin against God and then ask the Priest Pardon for it as if a Man should commit Treason in  England  against the King and then go to a Chimnysweeper or a Blackguardboy to be pardon'd for it That a Man shall go to a Shopkeeper in  Cheapside  to buy a License to commit Whoredom or to rob upon the Highway and stockjob Heaven in  ExchangeAlley  by  Puts  and  Refusal    If ever there was any Magick in  Aegypt  or  Arabia  like this History is entirely silent in it nor had the  Devil  ever Craft enough to teach his Disciples any such Art What Sums of Money would the Heathen Priests have raised if their Gods had took Bribes as ours do and Pardons for Sin and License to sin had been to be bought and sold at the Church Doors as it is with us  But these are merry Times and the Church Magick outdoes all the Conjurings of the Antients as much as Madam  Violante  outdoes a common StageTumbler or as an Hospital thoroughbred Surgeon does a Mountebank Toothdrawer  As to our religious Magick the Enthusiasms and Heresies that reign among us I think we must deal with them just as their Maker seems to have done let them alone give them up to their own Magick and to their own Delusions to believe the Lies of their own making For as those holy Cheats are the easiest to be discover'd they are the hardest to be cur'd because they are generally supported from this invisible World of Spirits these mighty good superior Beings that is to say the  Devil  with whom the Fathers of these religious Frauds have so intimate Acquaintance that the Mischiefs they spread and the Confusions which they bring every Day into all our religious Establishment are too deep rooted for all the Skill and Application of the more religious World to cure  But I must observe one thing here which is necessary to your Illumination and tho' it should bring me back and draw me in again to the Sin of Gravity which the Town hates yet venturing the general Displeasure I say 'tis necessary to take Notice here that these religious  Effluvia  of Hell which at present make such Confusion of Principles among us are so demonstrably embrac'd by the present  Magi  the Sages the Conversers  with good Spirits the  Rosicrucians  and Masters of the Occult Sciences and all the other Pretenders to Supernaturals and secret Illuminations that they leave us no more room to doubt but they are all Natives of the same Climate bred up in the same Country carrying on the same Interest and will share at last in the same Destruction when the Tares and the Wheat shall be skilfully and critically separated as we are well assur'd they will be  This indeed stands fair against all the modern Teachers of the  Rosicrucian  Whimsies and the Doctrine of Spirits  viz  that None of them apply to the Establishment of true Religion On the contrary they establish or strive to establish old Errors and continually broach new they preach another Doctrine and their Notions were they not expos'd by their own Extravagancies and Enthusiastic Brains would expose themselves being a kind of religious Ramble a confus'd and a confounding Heap of Nonsense The poor People would otherwise be in Danger of being wheedled into their Delusions but this unravels all their dark Schemes and tends to show us the Cheat of all the rest and to convince us that 'tis all a Black Art all a Diabolick a meer Emanation of Hell  Thus all their  Magick  detects and exposes it self all the high and blustring Bombast of Sacred Divine Excellent and such like discover whence they come the Pretences to Illuminations Communication or Intercourse with Spirits and an invisible World appear to be Pretences and no more Their Dreams of  Aerial  Substances and Spirituous Bodies the Inhabitants of the Elements the refin'd incorporeal Essences their Abstracts of Quintessence and a thousand more which they put upon the World I say they all smell of the Fire and Brimstone are born of Hell their invisible World is evidently to be understood the Infernal World and their Study of  the Sacred Sciences is neither more or less to speak in the common Dialect than dealing with the  Devil  there it begins and there it must and will end  What else means their Philosophick Cant of mingling the supernatural Essences their confounding the Terms of Religion and things Divine with the Dreams and the Jargon of their unsignifying Language loosing the Name of GOD  Devil  HEAVEN  Hell  in the Cant of their Trade and the labour'd Expressions of sacred Flame mental Fire immortal Spirit Perfection Corruption illuminating Genius and a vast Throng of Words tending to amuse the Foolish and distract the Wise tending to destroy Religion and all the solid Establishment of Heaven whether for the Felicity of the Just or Punishment of the Wicked  Had their Magick any Tokens of a truly Divine Institution of a heavenly Original and was this demonstrated by its confirming and conforming to the Principles of either Natural or Reveal'd Religion something might be said for it or was its Tendency to establish not bewilder the Understanding and to fix the Knowledge of the true God in the Minds of Men was it qualify'd to establish our Faith in divine Illuminations and truly to direct our Worship and Homage to Him encouraging at the same time Peace Justice Humility and every Christian Virtue Were this the Case we should not dispute with them the Converse of Spirits between us and the invisible World the Spirits uncas'd and fled from hence with the Spirits yet embodyed by an invisible and inconceivable Communication But leave it as it is a Matter indifferent to us at present till it comes to be understood better when we arrive there  CHAP V  Of the  Magick  of the present Time as it stands strip'd in the last  Chapter  from all the Pretences of the  Magicians  and the Delusions of  Hell  of what Length it has gone  or  is like to go  in  deluding Mankind what the  Magicians  can do and that they really have now no Converse with the  Devil  at all So that the Art being at an End the History comes to an End of course  HAVING in the last Chapter brought down this Idol call'd Magick to its true Original strip'd it of all the Masquerade Dresses jested a little about it and at last laid the Bastard at the  Devil  's Door who is the true Father of it One would think so Barefac'd an Imposture should be able to appear no longer in the World that it would be hiss'd off the Stage and that the very Boys and Girls would throw Stones and Dirt at it in the Street  But the Case is quite otherwise and in spight of Contradiction the  Devil  goes on his own way if this or that Nation or Country or People drop him and refuse him he goes to another like a true Pedlar if he is answer'd No at one Door he knocks at the next If he sells Counterfeits and is call'd Cheating Knave at one House he calls himself honest Man at another The  Devil  is never baulk'd but carries on his Game in spight of all the Repulses he meets with nay in spite of Heaven i  self  Besides he is never at a loss for Disguises and like a Lady at the Ball if she happens to have been known in her Masquerade Habit Yesterday tomorrow  she gets another that shall be a more perfect Disguise If he happens to be blown here he is conceal'd there If he is discover'd and known for a  Devil  today you shall mistake him again and take him for a Saint or  Magician  of another kind tomorrow  Nay and after all even where he is known to be the  Devil  and finds he cannot be disguis'd any longer yet he has his ways with him to win and please you and draw you in at least to bear with him seeing he does you no harm Thus do you not see the Crowd about the PuppetShow and do they not laugh and halloo and appear infinitely pleas'd with the grossest and simplest of all Cheats and that tho' they know them to be Cheats and Delusions and that they are but meer Puppets  So our  Magicians  tho' you know them to be Cheats tho' you know that notwithstanding all their Pretences they really deal with the  Devil  yet we have People among us that would be content and deal with them upon that very Score I want to know says the jealousheaded Countryman who has made me a Cuckold and don't tell me of the Cunning Man going to the  Devil  for Information Why I'd go to the  Devil  my self if I knew where he was rather than not find it out  Nay tho' you convince them that even in the worst of it all the Fellow is not so wicked as they think he is or as he makes of himself that he knows nothing of the  Devil  any more than they do but only cheats them and perswades them to believe he knows something when indeed he knows nothing of the matter yet still they will go to him Such an old Woman or such a young Fool told 'em that they had been with the Cunning Man and they will go too nor is it possible to perswade them against it till they have thrown their Money away and come back asham'd  So that the Delusion still goes on A young Girl has two Sweethearts and she goes to the Cunning Man to know which of those two shall have her A young Fellow has lost his Mistress and must know who Courts her Another has lost a Cow and away he goes to the Cunning Man to know who has stole her The crafty Sh  er like the  Devil  's Oracles of old gives doubtful Answers satisfies no Body and yet pleases every Body He sends the Girl home with an old Wife's Tale bids her lay two Sticks across under her Pillow and the first she dreams on will be the Man The poor Girl's Head runs upon the Affair of a Husband 'tis no wonder she should dream of one of them and it may be the right as well the wrong so that 'tis an even Lay But the Conjurer is right and to be once right secures him the Custom of all the young People in the Country whereas if he is out that's forgotten and does him no Harm  This is the  Devil  's lowpriz'd Game and he carries it on a great way and as the Mountebank oftentimes gets more Money than a licensed Physician and the Quack than the Doctor so the  Devil  gets more Clients than the Counsellor and his Agents have as much Practice as the Lawyers and perhaps upon as honest a foot too as some of them  I should enquire a little here and expose the weak Doings of those Cunning Men and how they delude the poor People but 'tis of no great Use For as 'tis one of the simplest things of its kind in the World and by which the poor People are the most impos'd upon yet 'tis perhaps one of the last Delusions in the World that they will be cur'd of nor can all the Cunning Men of a higher Kind in the whole World reason them out of it They will leave the Surgeon for the Mountebank  the Physician for the Quack the Parson for the Conjurer and God for the  Devil  A few short Tales upon this Part may perhaps illustrate the Speculation and show you the Force of Fraud tho' I doubt it will not do much towards a Cure  A  Magician  giving out his Bills and boasting of his mighty Perfomances went down in the way of his Calling as other Tradesmen do to  Bristol  Fair and there he did Wonders told Fortunes calculated Nativities look'd in the Girls Hands peep'd in their Eyes talk'd broad things to them to make them blush and then guessing from their Colour how things stood with them and by a thousand cross Questions first crept into their Cases and then told them for a mighty Discovery what they had discover'd to him with their own foolish Tongues that very Minute  Among the rest of the young Lasses that came to him with their Grievances there comes one with that laudable Question  if in Love  whether  I shall marry the Man or no  She was so Modest that she could not tell the Doctor her Case her self but she brings it him in Writing and instead of stating the Question as above  If in Love  she had written it  if Courted    The Doctor for they are all  Doctors  looks upon the Paper and seeing it a Woman's Hand 'Tis your own Writing Child says he I suppose you would not trust any body else with it she curtisy'd and said  Yes  so he reads it out  If in Love  whether the Man  will marry me  or  no  The Girl colour'd and said 'tis not so you don't read it right Sir Well Child says he I'll read it right  by and by  come hither Sweetheart pull off thy Glove let me see thy Hand so he takes her by the Hand looks in the Palm cries Hum very well all's right there then he feels her Pulse  Ha  says he with a kind of Start  is it so  well come Child says he sit down in this  Chair I'll tell thee a Story so the Girl after a few Curtesies and slight Refuses sits down and the Doctor begins his Story There was says he a young Woman a very pretty cleaver Girl as you are my Dear and with that he feels her Pulse again came to me t'other Day just with such a Question as this and after I had a little Talk with her and feeling her Pulse as I do yours my Dear and then he felt her Pulse again and started again  Ha  says he  'tis so indeed  and then goes on I by the Help of my Art which is the most certain Line for the Discovery of hidden Truth directed by Nature and by the Intercourse of invisible Beings which inform me of every thing proper to be known and for the Service of those who come to be assisted with my exalted Genius I say by my infallible Judgment I found the poor Girl had concealed something from me which indeed she ought not to have done  For by giving me a wrong Account of her Case how should I give a direct Answer were it not that I who am assisted by the good Spirits the Inhabitants of the superior World am not to be deceived  So I said to her Sweetheart thou hast concealed the chief Part of thy Case is there not something more in this Question than thou hast acknowledg'd She made me no Answer at first till I being illuminated by the bright Spirit of the fifth Region of  Alahamed irwishah  and by all the assisting Lights of the high exalted Atmosphere Here the Doctor run over a great many  Greek  Words which almost frighted the poor Girl whom he held fast by the Hand or Wrist all the while I said he that could not be deceived told her in plain Words Why thou hast concealed from me that thou art with Child at which continues he the guilty poor Girl having nothing to say and being not able to deny what she found was reveal'd to me by my neverfailing Intelligence confess'd  to me that it was so and I having Compassion for her Circumstances for she had been deluded promis'd her my powerful Assistance to bring the Knave to marry her which is now happily done to her infinite Satisfaction All this while he held her by the Wrist and look'd frequently in her Face  By the first he discern'd an unusual Fluttering and sudden Disorder in her Pulse occasioned by the Story being well enough told and the first Girl's Behaviour mimick'd to the Life by looking in her Face he saw her Colour come and go and when he talked of his knowing every thing from the superior Beings and the invisible Word he saw she was in the utmost Confusion  Now my Dear says the Doctor raising her by the Hand out of the Chair give me Leave to look a little farther so leading her to the Window he gently lifted up one of her Eyelids then he gave two Hums and said  Pretty well there  The Girl all the while blusht and colour'd and chang'd now red and then pale a little Conjuration indeed would tell the Doctor how it was with her  Now my Dear says he to the Girl you would do well to be so free with me as to let me know your whole Case if you think fit to trust me with it and for that I am as secret as Death you need not be under the least Concern about that for 'tis my Business I am trusted with the Secrets of Princes and am a Counsellor of Counsellors and if I should betray any body it would be a double Offence neither would the invisible Spirits communicate the Secrets of People's Affairs to me if they did not judge me faithful therefore you may trust me with the utmost Safety Child adds he I shall never divulge any thing that you commit to me  The Girl was as mute as a Fish and said not one Word to him but blush'd and colour'd as red as the Gills of a TurkeyCock when he is angry  Come my Dear says he perhaps you can't express your self freely so I won't press you any farther but sit down till I consult the good Spirits again who as I told thee are always ready to assist distressed Innocence and who will not fail to give me a full Information of your Case and Directions also for your Good so that I do not need you should make any kind of Confession of your Case to me I shall be able presently to tell it you directly without your Help so pray sit but two or three Minutes and I'll come to you again  Having said this to her he offer'd to go away at which the Girl fell a crying vehemently and the Doctor too cunning not to take hold of it and satisfied that he had hit the Mark stopt and came back to her Well my Dear says he I see how 'tis and I had partly Intelligence of it before as you may easily perceive But come Child adds he let's see what is to be done for thee She cried all the while but when he said What's to be done she said but could not speak it plain for crying  That  Thomas  would  and there she stopp'd I understand thee Child says he that I should make  Thomas  marry thee is it not  YES  says she and blubber'd  most sadly    Well says the Doctor but how far are you gone with Child let me know that and then I'll tell thee whether I can bring it to pass or no With that he laid his Hand gently upon her Belly I doubt thou art far gone says he About four Months says the Girl Well Child says he come to me again Tomorrow in the Afternoon and I'll tell thee what is resolved in thy Case by the Powers who assist my neverfailing Art So taking a Crown of the Poor Girl for letting him pump the Truth out of her own Mouth and getting the Reputation of a most eminent Magician and Man of Art he dismiss'd her for that time letting her know  that if he undertook to bring  Thomas  to marry her he should expect a more considerable Acknowledgement  In a word he took  Thomas  's Name and where he liv'd and found Ways to manage  Thomas  so well that  Thomas  came to him in two or three Days to get rid of a Ghost that haunted him The Case was this The Doctor had an Implement which he carried with him upon the Occasion of his Business a sub  le oilytongu'd young Fellow who was a JackofallTrades here he was a Juggler there a Tumbler Today a Conjurer at one time a Ghost or Apparition at another a  Devil  or Spirit and so acted all Shapes and Postures that could be desired  The Doctor having had his Intelligence from the Girl where  Thomas  liv'd and finding very happily that he lodg'd in a publick House not far off being Servant to a Tradesman who not having Room for him in his House paid for a Lodging for him in the Alehouse I say having gotten this Handle he sends his Ingineer to lodge in the same House  This Fellow finds an Opportunity to come so far acquainted with  Thomas  as always to know whither he went and upon what Errands and Business and the first Time that  Thomas  was sent of an Errand very happily for him was to a Village about a Mile out of the City and in the Evening  As  Thomas  was going to this Village this subtle Rogue gets behind a Wall in his Way and with a hollow dead kind of Voice calls him three times by his Name and immediately convey'd himself away into a Field of Corn where had  Thomas  suspected him he could not have found him and getting out of the Corn he runs round by another Way and puts himself just in the Way that  Thomas  was to come and as if he had been farther that Way and was returning meets  Thomas  fullbut as they call it one going from the City and the othere coming to it  They salute as usual and as Acquaintance and fall into a short Discourse upon the Occasion of the Voice that  Thomas  had heard  George  says  Thomas  I am very glad to see you I wish you would go back with me to yon' Town there I'd be much beholden to you for your Company  I am in great Haste  says George  I can't go now  O Pray do if you can for I'm terribly frighted  says Thomas    Frighted  says George  at what  Why as I came along by the stone Wall there  says Thomas  at the Bottom of the Hill I heard a Voice call me three Times by my Name aloud  Why what does that signify  says George  'twas somebody behind the Wall to be sure that knew you what shou'd you be frighted at that for  No no 'twas not behind the Wall 'twas rather on t'other side of the Road  says Thomas  but the Voice was up in the Air to be sure it must be some Spirit  Nay if it was up in the Air indeed  says George  there may be something in it those Voices are sad things my Master now would tell you exactly what it meant  Why ay  says Thomas  so they say  your Master  can tell Folks all such things but can't you tell abody something of it too come do go back with me a little  Nay  says George  since you are so concern'd I will go 'till I see you safe at the next Town or so but I must run Home then for 'tis almost Night and my Master will want me    So in short  George  goes along with him which was all he wanted  But  George  says  Thomas  what can this Voice mean  How many Times did it call you  says George    Three Times  says Thomas    And was it very loud and distinct  says George  Are you sure you are not deceived for sometimes People fancy Voices when there are none  Ay that may be  says Thomas  but I an't so fancyful I am very sure I heard it three Times it call'd my Christian Name and Sirname  Thomas  first then  Thomas Saunders  and  Thomas Saunders  again 'twas a  Devil  's Voice to be sure 'twas harsh and hollow as the  Devil    Nay I don't like it I confess  says George  it seems to signify Death when People are called so and it may be in three Days three Weeks or three Months or three Years  Can't you tell me which  says Thomas    No really  says George  I can't go so far as that If my Master was to know the Case he would tell you exactly but I dare say 'tis Death or something very bad  They had not gone far after this but  George  watching a convenient Place gives a little Start and stops looking as if he saw something Hold a little says he to  Thomas    What's the matter  says Thomas    Matter  says George  Nay you best know what's the matter have you committed Murther  Thomas  have you kill'd any body  I kill'd any body Mercy upon me  says Thomas  what do you mean  Why do you see nothing  says George  do ye see nothing * there  He points to a great Tree which stood on the Common which they were going over  No not I  says Thomas  don't fright me you know  George  I am frighted enough already  Nay  says George  I don't desire to fright you  Thomas  but you would be worse frighted than I if you saw it I'm glad you don't  But what is it  says Thomas  Dear  George  tell me is it the  Devil  No no  not the  Devil  says  George  but 'tis a Spirit 'tis a Ghost to be sure that made me ask if you had kill'd any body  Well I shall die  says Thomas  I'm e'en dead with the F  ight Why how should you see it and not I  George  O there's a Reason for that  says George  my Master gave me a particular Sight that I can see Apparitions when others can't it belongs to our Business but you'll see it presently for it will come nearer I see that  O  says Thomas  what shall I do  George  will it speak to me  I don't know yet  says George  it may be not I'll tell you presently  They continued going forward all this while and began to come pretty near the Town when byandby  says George  I don't know what to think of it  Thomas  it threatens and makes Signs as if it would come up to you and strike you  Strike me  says Thomas  nay then 'twill kill me to be sure  No no they never kill any body besides I see you are in such a Fright I'll see if I can speak to it and keep it off if my Master were here he'd send it away with a Word speaking With that  George  goes three Steps forward bids  Thomas  stand still draws a Circle with his Stick upon the Ground and puts  Thomas  into it Stand there  says George  and you shall be safe and don't be afraid I'll see what I can do for thee  Thomas  stands still as he was bid but quaking and trembling in the utmost Confusion and  George  goes forward a little out of the Way and talks aloud but so that  Thomas  could hear only the Voice not understand the Words and  George  makes a great many Motions and Crosses in the Air and this he held a good while when he comes back to  Thomas    Well  Thomas says he  I believe I have deliver'd you for this time but something is the matter this Apparition threatens you strangely I fancy you'll hear of it again  But is it gone now  says Thomas    Stand still  says George  a little I think 'tis a going  So  George  and he stand still a little Ay there  says George  it goes off that Way pointing North and now 'tis gone up in the Air  says George  come now we'll go on So away they went to the Town and  George  tells him he must take his Leave of him and run home as hard as he can drive  Dear  George says Thomas  don't leave me why I could not go back in the dark if you would give me a thousand Pounds  I can't possibly stay  says George  if you are so frighted you had best lie there all Night and come Home in the Morning  I dare not do that neither  says Thomas  my Master will be so angry 'tis as much as my Place is worth  Why then you must get somebody to come with you at the Town  says George  for indeed I can't stay now So away comes  George  and leaves him and sets up a Run as if he was bound to be back again with the utmost Expedition  When  George  had got away and was out of sight he alter'd himself as he knew very well how to do by his Skill in Postures and Tumbling which  as before  was a Part of his Trade and having a linnen Habit in his great Pocket dresses himself up in the  Habit of a Ghost or an Apparition not in a Shrowd like a dead Body but all in white down to the Feet and a Woman's Headdress upon his Head and in this Posture he places himself where he knew  Thomas  would come But before this covering his Habit with his great Coat he plac'd himself at the Village in sight of the Door where  Thomas  went in that he might be sure to know when he came out and which Way he went lest he should take some other Way and also to know who and how many he got to come with him  He soon found  Thomas  on his Way for he came out of the House and two Fellows with him in about an Hour So  George  follow'd 'em at a distance 'till he saw them in a little Lane leading into the Common as before and when he knew they could go no other Way upon which he run by another Way over the Fields and got into the Common before them  The first thing he did was to get into a little Thicket where lying flat on the Ground and out of Sight he lay and hiss'd like a Serpent most frightfully This had its immediate Effect for it frighted them all and he heard one of them say It was the  Devil  and that he was come for  Thomas  to be sure and the other said so too adding that he would go no further this was enough for  George  for by this he knew they were no Champions that  Thomas  had brought along with him so removing and getting to another Place a little behind them that they might not run back again there he chang'd his Note and then growl'd like a great Dog and that frighted them again Now having made this Beginning he leaves off a little and goes into the Common and stands in the middle of the Road just where the Lane open'd into the Heath so that he might be sure to be seen all in white a little before they came out of the Lane  The Night was not very dark but no Moonlight some Stars not many were seen when coming to the Lane's end they saw the Spectre and no sooner saw it but all three run away and cry'd out most terribly  George  had now his End for he didn't desire to carry it on any farther so he kept his Post 'till he found by their Noise they cross'd the Common farther off and out of Sight then he put off his Habit and made the best of his Way to their Lodging where when  Thomas  came he found  George  very sedately standing at the Door smoaking his Pipe  He bad  Thomas  wellcome Home but said no more not taking the least notice of any thing but found that  Thomas  went immediately up Stairs and threw himself down upon the Bed and the next Morning  Thomas  was very sick  George  in the mean time went home to his Master and gave him an Accoun  of the whole Transaction who finding his Engines work to his Mind gave  George  farther Instructions which were in short to haunt the poor Fellow Night and Day and give him no Quiet 'till he had manag'd him up to a Necessity of coming to him the  Doctor  for Help which was not long first  I should have observed that the Doctor or Cunning Man finding he should compass his Ends upon  Thomas  sent now for the poor Girl and told her that he had employed the utmost of his Art and Skill in her Behalf And upon my Word adds he my Child I have had a fatherly Concern for you and I have engaged so many of the good Spirits of the superior Regions in your Favour that they always ready to do Acts of Beneficence and Kindness to distress'd Mortals have assured me that  Thomas  shall marry you ay and shall come and court you to have him too as much as if he had not gotten this unjust Advantage of you or he  shall have no Rest in this Life nay he shall have no Rest in this Life 'till he does  The poor Girl  mil'd and was mightily pleas'd as you may well suppose and puts her Hand in her Pocket and gives the Doctor half a Guinea for the good News The Doctor took the Money but told her modestly that if he did her such a great piece of Service as this she must consider  c  She understood him and told him she had not a great deal of Money but yet she had a rich Aunt and other good Friends and  Thomas  need not ha' us'd her so for that ifand then she cry'd again she would have scorn'd to ha' marry'd him butI understand you Child says the Doctor now you must not only take him but must be glad he will take you Yes Sir says she  Well  says the Doctor  and does your Aunt know this unlucky Story  Yes Sir says the Girl and she bid me tell you she will make a handsome Present to you if you can bring it about  Well Child says the Doctor tell your Aunt I will undertake to do it if she will be as good as her Word  Indeed she will Sir I will bring it you says she and nam'd the Sum which was no less than twenty Pounds and the Doctor with an unusual Modesty not craving any more told her generously that if he fail'd he would have nothing more than she had given him already  This Treaty took up two or three Days and in the mean time  George  haunted  Thomas  upon several Occasions Nay he could hardly stir out of Doors in the Night but he show'd himself sometimes all in White sometimes all in Black till at last  Thomas  comes to him one Evening  George says he  dear  George  if you don't help me I know not what to do I am harrass'd out of my Wits  This  Devil  if it is the  Devil  haunts me so that it gives me no Rest Last Night it call'd me again three times at my Chamber Window the very same Voice and three times over just as it did at the long Wall  NB George  had cunningly got a Ladder in the Night and set it up to the Fellow's Window and went up and call'd him aloud with the same hollow dead Sound as he did before  Well  says George  I am sorry for it  Thomas  I would have you send for a Minister and prepare for another World for I doubt you are not very long for this World  But did not you tell me  says Thomas  your Master could do something for me  Yes indeed  says George  I did so and I believe he could if you han't let it run too far and if you han't done some sad thing  Thomas  For the Spirits of the invisible World which my Master knows and converses with are all good Spirits  Thomas  and they will do no nothing for you adds he if you have committed Murder or Robbery or any such thing and therefore if that be your Case do not let me carry you to my Master for he can do you no good  Thomas  star'd as if he had been bewitch'd  Mercy upon me  what do you mean  Brother George says he  I am as Innocent as the Child unborn I never did any such thing in my Life  Well  Thomas  says  George  if you speak honestly I'll let my Master know your Case and if you will come to our Office tomorrrow Morning you shall have his Answer  Good George says Thomas  don't put it off till tomorrow what shall I do  Why George  the  Devil  will murder me tonight  What would you have me do  says George  I'll go immediately if you will but I doubt he is not at home  However  Thomas  pressing him away they go to the Doctor together which was indeed what  George  wanted When they came to him  George  introduces the young Man and in a word tells him the whole Story at Large and implores his high superior Assistance to the poor distress'd young Man who was daily terrify'd and harrass'd to the danger of his Wits  But says the Doctor just as  George  had been taught to do before I fear this Man has committed some flagrant Crime and so the evil Sprits have a right to pursue him Hark thee Friend come hither to me let me see thy Hand hast thou not committed Murder or Treason No indeed Sir  says Thomas  never in my Life  Well pull of thy Glove says the Doctor  Here Sir  says Thomas  you may see I an't burnt in the Hand  Pr'ythee young Man says the Doctor I don't look for that so he examines his Palm Well says the Doctor all's  well here  Nor you have committed no Robbery or Felony don't come to me if you are Guilty of any such Crimes as you ought to be hang'd for  No indeed I han't and't please you  says Thomas    Then the Doctor feels his Pulse and looks him full in the Face Here is some Disorder some Guilt here Look ye young Man assure your self if you have stole any Thing or committed any Crime the good Spirits Inhabitants of the invisible World whose sublime Influences I shall apply to them for in your Behalf and to deliver you from the Power of the evil Spirits which haunt you thus will do nothing for you if you are a Criminal and more than that they will certainly inform me of it as soon as I make my Application for your Relief and tell it me as the Reason why they can do nothing  for you so you had better let me know it beforehand  Indeed Sir and please you  says Thomas  I have never done any such thing in my Life  Hast thou ever done any Injury  says the Doctor  to any for which thou can'st be thus plagu'd  No indeed Sir not I  says Thomas    Well Friend  says the Doctor  I enquire for your Service only for I don't care what you have done nor do I care to know it But let me ask you one Question more and then I shall be able to speak for you in general as a very innocent honest Person Are you willing to make Satisfaction or Reparation to any Body or to every Body that you have done any Injury to  Yes Sir with all my Heart  says Thomas  and Sir adds he I have never done any Hurt in all my Life  All this while the Doctor holds him by the Hand and every now and then feels his Pulse Look you Friend says he here is some little Disorder here in your Blood your Conscience flutters and is a little disturb'd Come don't send me of a Fool's Errand for if thou doest I cannot only do thee no good but these evil Spirits will tear thee to Pieces when they know as they will do that I have spoke for thee Come I'll ask thee but one Question more Has there been no Love  usiness between any young Girl and you and she has b  oke her Heart and is dead for you and now pays you home for it and plagues you for it seems you say the Apparition had a Woman's Headdress on  No indeed Sir  says Thomas  I ne'er had any Fancy but for one and she is alive I am sure I saw her several times since this happen'd  Now the Doctor had him fast Well is there any thing between you is she your Sweetheart still  No and't please you  says Thomas  we have done  Done  says the Doctor  What have you done you han't lain with her have you But however come  Thomas says the Doctor  I must own that is not a fair Question so I don't press you to answer me I hope you have done the Girl no Wrong if you have you say you will make Reparation Come sit down there till I go into my Study and if you have been Honest I shall serve you I don't doubt but if you han't I shall come back and tell you all you have conceal'd without giving my self the Trouble of asking you  Here  Thomas  began to stare and look frighted Why Sir and't please you  says he  must I confess every thing  No no  Thomas says the Doctor  I don't ask you to confess any thing I'll come back presently and tell you as well as if you told me your self  Ay but then Sir  says Thomas  you say if I don't tell you every thing first then I shall get no Help afterwards  That's very true  Thomas says the Doctor gravely  I do say so and therefore if you have any thing to tell me before I go let me know it but I don't oblige you to tell you may do as you will if you have any thing to say tell me if not tell me  Why nothing Sir but about the Girl a little  Why  there now  I thought so when I felt your Pulse didn't I almost tell you so says the Doctor I warrant you ye have lain with the poor Girl now and it may be got her with Child is that it  I'm afraid so indeed Sir  says Thomas  but it was but twice  Well  says the Doctor  you drew her in I dare say by promising to marry her didn't you  I think you know every thing  says Thomas  indeed 'tis so Sir  And then  says the Doctor  when you found the poor Girl was with Child you disappointed her I suppose  Yes Sir  says Thomas  there's no hiding any thing from you I think  Well  Thomas says the Doctor  but what shall I do for you now for unless you make this poor Girl some Satisfaction there's no saving you Where is she you say she's alive it seems  Yes  and't please you  she's alive  says Thomas  she don't live far off  Well what must be done  Thomas says the Doctor  What would you marry her will that give her Satisfaction  Thomas  Yes  and't please you  I'll marry her and I'll send for her just now  says Thomas    What and marry her in the Dark  says the Doctor  that won't do  Thomas    Why Sir  says Thomas  I'll marry her over again  by Daylight    No no  Thomas says the Doctor  we won't break through the Laws neither I'll tell you what you shall do  Send for the Girl  and let me hear her Story and what she demands if marrying her will do  Thomas  and that will satisfie her you shall sign a Bond here to her to marry her tomorrow Morning and then to protect you from the  Devil  that haunted you you shall lie here with my other Man  Will  tonight and I will answer none of them will dare to haunt you in my House  With all my Heart  an't please you says Thomas  if you will promise me I shall not be haunted any more afterwards  Why  Thomas says the Doctor  to secure you I'll cast a Figure for you tonight and I will know if those  Voices  and  Spectres  were upon her Account or no and if they were I will answer for it you shall hear no more of them after you have marry'd  her and if they were not you shan't be oblig'd to take her that's a fair Proposal  Thomas    Nay Master  an't please you  says Thomas  I think I should take her that's the Truth on't and I'll e'en have her  I think  whether I am deliver'd or no since you say 'tis just and I should do it And  besides Master says Thomas  she is a good honest Girl and loves me too mainly and she'll be a good Wife I'll e'en take her Master for better for worse  Now you speak honestly  says the Doctor  Now I like you  Thomas  I warrant you the  Devil  will haunt you no more if you take her but you have been but a kind of a Rogue to her before I understand  Upon the whole the Doctor heartens him on the young Fellow is easy and the young Woman is sent for and in the Morning they were marry'd and had a great WeddingDinner near the Doctor's House so that all was done to the Girl's Mind and the Conjurer's too For the Doctor had two Gunieas of  Thomas  for delivering him from the  Devil  Who could do it cheaper and twenty of the good Wife's Friends and the Lady that gave the Money thought it very well bestow'd  This Management of the  Magician  serves to let you see with what Art and Dexterity these Men play the Doctor with our ignorant People and well they deserve the Name of  Cunning Men  and as this is the greatest Part of the Magick they are Masters of so this is the chief End and Aim of this Relation to let the Reader into the Cheat of it Here were two Fools manag'd by one cunning Knave yet both of them are serv'd The Knowledge of their Story and the way to do them both Justice is pick'd out of their own Mouths yet they are brought to do one another Justice and  believe 'tis all done by the Magick of the Cunning Man he gets their Money and they come both off thankful into the Bargain And here's not an Ounce of Magick in it all here's no dealing with the  Devil  in all this 'Tis nothing but a  Bite  a kind of a Juggle a  Devil  and no  Devil  a Doctor no Conjurer a Vision without a Spirit a Dance without a Fiddle and in a word here was Craft but no Knavery neither For what he did ended in doing a poor injur'd Wench Justice and bringing a young impudent Fellow upon his Knees making him take the Woman not indeed for the Fear of God but for Fear of the  Devil    This Account of the Doctor or Cunning Man may stand upon Record as a Specimen of the Magick which we have now generally practis'd among us or if you please to take it as a Specimen of what is at present put upon the World for Magick For as to the Real Black Art or Dealing with the  Devil  by way of Compact Intercourse Witchcraft and such like we find so little of it left that we have some reason to say 'tis quite out of Use and we have heard very little of it in this Part of the World for many Years  Not that we are much better than our Ancestors nor have we seen any thing in the Manners of the People less addicted to Sorcery than formerly but Custom has made Men turn  Magicians  to themselves we seem to carry on our Correspondence with Hell single handed and by a kind of immediate Intercourse so that we want no more the Help of the  Magician  whatever we do of the Magick And here I think the Magick it self being as it were brought to a Conclusion the History of it is justly at a Conclusion also The Arts of Hell are now no more carry'd on by particular Instruments and by way of Profession the Black Art is at End the  Devil  having no more need of the  Magicians    has drop'd them and manages his Affairs himself and the  Magicians  having no other Access to the  Devil  than what is Imaginary and carry'd on by meer Legerdemain whatever it was formerly their Number is decreas'd and in a manner worn off by Time so that you have now nothing left but a few Jugglers Cunning Men Gypsies and Fortuntellers In short the Trade is decay'd and we may suppose the Managers of the Black Negotiation have turn'd their Hands to other Employments  CHAP VI  Of raising the  Devil  by Magical Operations whether the Magicians really have such a Power or no and if they have whether it is perform'd as an Art and by the Consequence of Magical Experiments or whether it is by Concert and mutual Consent between  Satan  and the  Magicians    RAising the  Devil  has been thought by some to be a Branch of  Witchcraft  rather than  Magick  and then it should not be mention'd in this Place but the Point is not fully decided It seems both the Worthy Professions have pretended to it and perhaps both have attain'd to practise it and so it may be reckon'd among the  Occult Sciences  in common to the Practitioners of both Kinds and then may be properly treated of in which part of our Undertaking we please  It is a kind of a vulgar Expression and has not much Propriety in it  I mean that of raising the Devil  for the  Devil  is not rais'd he is rather brought down As his Abode is expresly said to be in the  upper Regions and his Principality is in the Air he is not fetch'd out of the Earth and as some have thought with the stamp of a Foot as if he lodg'd under us and we knock'd for him as the sick Body knocks upon the Floor for the Nurse to come up Stairs and speak to him  Satan certainly is not far out of Call tho' 'tis still someting doubtful in what particular Element he inhabits    Not in the Earth  say I because then he would be impower'd to shake the World with Earthquakes overturn Cities and Towns and give Mankind perpetual Disturbances and perhaps would be oblig'd to do so as often as he mov'd from Place to Place Nay it would seem necessary that the Earth notwithstanding his spirituous Nature must suffer some Convulsions Dislocations and Openings or some or other Distortions every time an old Woman had Occasion to speak with him    Not in the Sea  this is apparent by the  Devils  of  Gadarene  who besought Christ not to send them away into  the Deep  It seems they have an Aversion to the Water and that therefore Instinct led the Herd of Swine to run into the Sea to deliver themselves from the  Devil  supposing he would leave them when they came there But the Hogs it seems were not sagacious enough to find their Way out again or to consider that before they went in  Luke  viii    Not in the Fire  Because that Element is appropriated for their final State is to be their Prison and the Place of their Punishment and as they have at present an Interval for Action so they must have a Medium of Space for their Residence during the time of Action    It must  then be  in the Air  or airy Regions and as we have reason to believe that they are not confin'd to the Atmosphere of this Globe the  Earth which compar'd to them their Numbers and the Extent of their Operations would be by much too narrow a Place for them too much prescrib'd and limited and give them no room for Action in proportion to themselves so I am willing to  llow Satan to be in Capacity at least able to visit all the Atmospheres and Spaces in the immense Waste whether of habited habitable or uninhabited Bodies and whether in those we call Planets or such Bodies as we have no Name for because no Knowledge of  Thus the  Devil  cannot complain that I have not given him room enough since I have deny'd his Locality to no Place but  Heaven  where he cannot come and perhaps does not now desire it and the other gross Elements which could not contain him  The  Devil  being Resident chiefly at least in that invisible Wo  d the Air and which we particularly call the World of Spirits our bringing him out into Company is very unworthily call'd raising the  Devil  for how can that be rais'd up which is already not below  However if we will talk intelligibly we must call things as other People call them and speak of them as other People understand them that they may know what we talk of and know how to think upon what we speak to them about Having therefore no other way of expressing it you must be content to hear me speak of raising the  Devil  tho' at the same time I tell you 'tis Nonsense in the very Terms and contrary to Nature  But to hold you no longer upon settling Preliminaries the Point in hand is Can the Magicians who we are now speaking of raise the  Devil  or can they not Can the  Magick Art  perform this high Operation is it in the reach of the Profession and is  Satan  subjected to it is he obliged to come  when he is call'd when such and such Words of Command are given out such and such Methods us'd such and such Words repeated is he rous'd as the Keeper rouzes the Lions in the  Tower  disturb'd from his Abode and oblig'd to come away or as the Huntsman unharbours a Deer by his Horn and his Hallow  If the  Devil  is under this Necessity and is thus at the Summons of every Glass Trumpet as we may call it that every Scoundrel rascally  Figure caster  and  Circlemaker  can fetch him up when they think fit I must say I think Satan is no free Agent He is very far from being a Prince and a Prince of the Power of the Air Nay there are so many rational Objections against it so many Difficulties Absurdities and even Impossibilities in it that I think there is hardly room for any farther Dispute about it the thing has nothing in it rational or agreeing to common Sense  But how is it done then for that it is so and that the  Devil  does appear when they call does come when he is sent for and that by the meanest of those Creatures who have those Dealings with him is not to be deny'd nor never has been deniable since the Witch of  Endor  's Days nor will it want Confirmation on many Occasions since that Did not she put it to  Saul  who he would have her bring up intimating that she could bring up whom she pleas'd even the  Devil  himself if he wanted him  It must be then by Concert and Agreement for if the  Devil  can't be forc'd out of his Den if he is not conjur'd up as we call it he must be invited in a friendly manner and prevail'd upon by Entreaties or expected by Agreement and in both these Cases 'tis much more ageeeable to our Understanding and we can conceive of things with much more Propriety  Either he is invited by Entreaties and Petitions importun'd and earnestly desir'd to come and this is a kind of Peculiar for that it is a Reality we have no room to doubt I say 'tis peculiar to those Countries where the  Devil  is worship'd as a God where they bow the Knee and as the  Indians  call it say  O  to him as a supreme Power That he willingly observes these Summons and comes when they desire him is easy to suppose as he is a politick  Devi  and willing to preserve his Possession among  m willing to be worship'd and ador'd as he most obsequiously as upon those Occasions and which he in a manner triumphs over his Maker by as if he  d gain'd a Victory had conquer'd those Parts of his Dominions and taken them from him by Force  Or on the other hand he is oblig'd by Contract between h  mself and those Infernal Merchants that trade with him I say he is oblig'd to come when they have Occasion for him and in this case he must perform his Promise or else he would not maintain his Credit and would not be trusted again Thus in one he is bound to come as he is a cunning  Devil  and knows his Interest and in the other Case as he is an honest  Devil  and keeps his Word tho' the last is subject to many Breaches and F  lsifications and he is not always as good as his Word neither  All the Difficulty that lies before us here is how he makes his Bargains Witches and Wizards they tell us sign Contracts let him prick their Hands and sign with their Blood Hellish Doings but I do not tell you I give any Credit to them But the  Magicians  who it is suppos'd are Persons of a sup  ur Dignity seem to act upon a better foot and by the Help of what they call Art have to do with him in a superior Way what that Way is and what Art it is to be call'd that brings the  Affairs of Hell into such a Management is the great Question before me  It is true the Magicians deny it and Dr  Boreman  would have told you he scorn'd your Words he raised no  Devil  he had to do with no evil Spirits he dealt with no such Cattle but on the contrary that he laid the  Devil  when other People raised him that he cured Houses that were haunted and turned the  Devil  out of Doors when he was got in all which I believe as stedfastly as I do that St  Dunstan  took him by the Nose with a pair of red hot Tongs or that St  Francis  would have nothing to do with him when he appeared to him in the Shape of a Bag of Money or that St  Ignatius  resisted him when he tempted him in the Shape of a naked beautiful Lady  Where by the way if the  Legend Makers  of the  Romish  Church could prove those two Passages to be true in Fact so that we could no more doubt them we should have much more Reason to take those two Persons for Saints than ever I thought we had It must be confess'd the thing would be rare in itself to see a Priest kick a Purse of Gold out of his Way upon the Road and not think it worth his while to take it up So to see a young Lady beautiful and charming offer herself to a Priest and he turn from her as  Joseph  from his Mistress look'd a little more Saintlike than I must own I should expect from any of the Tribe especially on the  Roman  Side of the Question I hope our own Church has abundance of such Saints among the Clergy tho' I may not have the Honour to be acquainted with many of them  But these Men of Art can raise him that seems to be a Truth too solid to be deny'd and I must not hazard my Reputation so much as to oppose all the old Women that have seen him or dream'd they saw him So that I must take it for granted  that they can raise him tho' I believe it no more than I do that Dr  Boreman  could lay him when other People had raised him which I take to be whimsical and ridiculous  But supposing then for Discourse sake that they can raise him as they call it What is it and how is it done  As to what it is I take it to be no more than this that the  Devil  is pleased at their Desire signify'd to him in such manner  as to the Magician in his great Wisdom seems meet  to assume a Visibility and pu  on such a Shape or Person as he and the Magician agrees upon for the present Purpose This being granted two Things necessarily follow  That the  Devil  and the Magician really correspond  That the  Devil  was present before only not visibly  First  That the  Devil  and the Magician correspond By Corresponding must I think be understood that the Magician knows where Satan is that Measures are concerted between them how to converse as was the  ase between him and  Albrahazen  o  whom already and that by these concerted Measures he can ask the Favour of  Satan  as often as he pleases to make himself visible for such or such an Occasion as at  hat time presents  By this it should seem according to the Opinion of Some learned in this Wisdom that those Magicians that are eminent in their Practice have some  Devil  or other always with them visible to themselves tho' invisible to others and that they both see and converse with them continually This is very rational to believe and is what I take to be that which the Scripture means by having a Familiar Spirit and that  Menasseh  had such the Text is positive  in Now that these Men or Women whether Magicians or what you please to call them can desi  e the Favour of their  Familiar  or Secondary  Devil  to assume a Shape and put on Visibility I make no question of it seems to be no great matter and to have no great Difficulty in it On the other hand these seem to be the only People that can raise the  Devil  for how should any body else do it upon such common and ordinary Occasions if he was not at their Elbow how could they call him with muttering over a little Gibberish and talking it in Whisper too The  Devil  is not Omniscient he cannot at the Distance of his airy Dwelling know the Thoughts of the Agent or see the Circles and Figures he draws he must therefore be invisibly present with him can see his Circles Crosses and Figures and all his Motions whether publick or private and I insist upon it that none can raise the  Devil  in this manner but such Men as those that have a certain and constant Intercourse with him I do not say that the Magicians have this Correspondence with him nor do I say or believe that all of them can bring  Satan  into Apparition when they please but this I do both say and believe that those that can or do thus raise him  as we call it  do it by this Means and have such a Correspondence and Intimacy with him and that it can be done by no other  All the Notions which we can have of the  Devil  founded upon the Scripture or upon Reason seem to justify this Opinion for unless we shall allow him to be Infinite Omniscient and Omnipresent and that would be to make him a God we cannot make it rational that he should be commanded into Visibility and Action just when we please  If he is confin'd to Locality if he is anywhere and that Anywhere is Somewhere then he must  have some settled Intelligence established between him and Mankind for the carrying on his Business and this must be carried on by the Agency of some Spirits it cannot be by Voice only by meer Whisper and Suggestion if he be not present for tho' it may be true that Spirits converse without the Help of Voice yet infernal Spirits cannot act as the Infinite Eternal Being acts namely by infinite extensive Knowledge they must converse by the Instrumentality and Agency of their Persons it is true it may be imperceptible to human Sight and it is so but there is not the less Reality in their Agency for that there is not the less Personality nor Agency of Persons or Places on that account for That may as really be that cannot be perceived to exist as That which is visible  Now stand clear Magick and stand clear Magicians for if the Magician can raise the  Devil  he must correspond with the  Devil  and if he corresponds with the  Devil  he must have a Familiar or how does he do it The  Devil  must either be always by him or have an Agent  Devil  in Commission always attending him and always ready to act  s he shall direct a Deputy  Devil  under Orders and  nstructed to act for him and to personate either  Devil  or other Shape as Occasion presents or as the Magician pleases to direct It can be no otherwise  ot the  Devil  himself can act upon any other foot  All we have to say for our Magicians is to hope  hat what they have to say for themselves may have  ome Truth in it namely that they deal with Spi  its but that it is with good Spirits not with the  Devil  or with evil Spirits and this we have only  heir own Words for we cannot be sure it is so  or will I venture to say that we have a great  eal of Reason to believe them at least there may  e room to doubt the Truth of it  I would rather advance for them what I have much more Reason to believe and that is that they deal with no Spirits at all either good or bad for if I should once entertain a Belief that they really consulted with any Spirits at all I should be afraid they were  Devils  because as I have said that I believe the  Devil  would not be at their Book at every Turn so often as they have Occasion for him so I am less of the Opinion that the good Spirits would be called backward and forward on their trivial and frivolous Errands nor is it rational to believe they should  If then they have any Spirits I doubt they are  Devils  not good Spirits but my more justifiable Opinion and which I think is really wellgrounded is that most if not all of them who pretend to this Converse with Spirits have no Knowledge of or Correspondence with any Spirits at all but that all the Cant of their good Spirits the Inhabitants o  the invisible World and their Intelligence with them is a Cheat a meer Cheat and Delusion to abuse the ignorant world impose upon the weak and i  possible gain themselves a Character and a Fame o  Knowledge and Wisdom in order to pick Pockets and get Money  How many Tricks do they play with Mankind how many Frauds do they put upon us under how many ShamAppearances do they juggle with us 'Tis plain when any sublime Doctrine comes to b  discuss'd by them they are all in the dark the neither can conceive right themselves or teach u  how to make a right Judgment of any thing bu  appear to be empty ignorant Creatures themselves who have like  Jacob Behemen  got a high Cant o  mystick Language Words without Meaning and as I said before valued only for their being u  intelligible and that entirely so and very part  +cularly  too for that they are so put together that not only no body that hears them can understand them but that they do not understand 'em themselves  This certainly is the just Character of most of the Magicians we meet with in our Times what may have been formerly or what may yet be where the  Devil  has really a Correspondence with any of these People and if there are any  Albrahazens  alive I will not determine but then I say either these must have a more than intimate Converse with the  Devil  personally as  Ali  had or they must do it by way of  Familiar  by a constant attending Agent and then they are no more Magicians but  Necromancers  and downright Dealers with the  Devil  and this is not what we are talking of it not what they pretend to nor is it really in them  To bring it then down to the Case in hand I mean about raising the  Devil  the present Question is of two Parts  First  Whether the Magicians have a Power to raise the  Devil  that is to produce an Appearance or Apparition of the  Devil  This I say I will not deny only that then I say they are no more Magicians but Witches Wizards Necromancers or what else you please to call those People that have an immediate Conversation with the  Devil    Secondly  Whether if they can do it at all 'tis done  as an Art  a System for the Practice of which there are Rules and Methods which being learned by others enables them to perform the same thing as an Operation whether mathematical or otherwise and this I think I may venture to deny because I think it subjects Satan to such a Situation of Circumstances as are inconsistent with all the Notions we have of him as a Spirit as a powerful unlimited Seraph a Prince of the Air and who except where his Maker has limited and prescribed  him is placed in a Station inconceivably superior to all human Influence or Operation  To talk of screwing the  Devil  up into an Engine that like a Jack in a Box he may be brought out and shewn for a Sight to the People whenever a Conjurer thinks fit or to be shewn like a PuppetShow for Twopence apiece I must needs say this is really dishonouring the  Devil  himself  What may be done by Concert and Agreement between the  Devil  and them is one thing but to talk of bringing him out by an Art or Invention so that as I said before the Artists may call him in or call him up when they  this wou  be raising him indeed in the very litteral Sense of the Word and may be for ought I know what was the true Meaning of the Expression at fir  nd I must observe here this raising the  Devil  is an old way of speaking and was formerly much more in use among us than it is now for I am not yet determined in the matter fully whether it be a Fact or a meer proverbial Speech My Opinion at present must necessarily be for the latter for as to raising him 'tis as I have said already a piece of Nonsense because it intimates that he is fetch'd up  ab inferis  from Below whereas I have given many good Reasons to move you to believe he is already rather Above than Below and Because I can give you many more to prove that if he was Below that is to say in  Hell  in the bottomless Pit it self as we have too much fancy'd he is all the old Women and old Witches and all the Prayers in the Parish read backward all the Circles and Figures all the  Pawwaws  and Conjurings in the World could never fetch him out again 'till He comes who has the Key of the  Bottomless Pit  and  who shuts  and no Man  can open    We are told that St  Peter  gave our holy Father of St  Angelo  the Keys of  Heaven  but I doubt he has not the Keys of t'other Place too if he has he has been but a sorry Jaylor for the  Devil  has been abroad these four thousand Years to our Knowledge and continues still at large not a Constable can take him up even a  Scape Warrant  cannot apprehend him  As he is then  at large  tho' he is a Prisoner too in one Sense but as I say the  Devil  is at large he is then a free Agent as to us he goes  to and fro in  or throughout  the Earth  and  walks up and down therein  Job i He has free Liberty of  Egress  and  Regress  can go and come when where and how he pleases  I must plead for  Liberty  you see tho' it be for the  Devil  It has pleased his Maker to give this  roaring Lion  Liberty to go up and down seeking  c  and how came he to sell or lose that Liberty How came the Magician to be the  Devil  's Jaylor that he should have him in his Custody to call him out when he thinks fit If it is so 'tis a voluntary Confinement and the  Devil  finds his Account in it or he would never submit to it so that it must be by a Consent of Parties and then we come into the Road of things again that is to say that the  Devil  may consent to appear when he is so and so and for such and such Purposes required but this is quite another thing than what the  Magicians  are said to do I must therefore give it against them The  Devil  is not to be raised by Art no Magick no Conjuring no Circles or Squares no Prayers read backward no or forward either will bring him out unless he pleases and finds it for his Purpose If he comes at all he comes of himself and about his own Business or by Agreement with his own Domesticks such as old Mother of  Endor    or Mother  Lackland  of  Ipswich  or such as he is in actual Confederacy with but as for your Pretenders to Art that they can raise him and lay him  etch him in or send him out 'tis all a Cheat and the Magician has this to be said in his Favour that he really is not so intimate with the  Devil  as he says he is  CHAP VII  Seeing as the  Magicians  pretend they do not Deal with the  Devil  o  raise the  Devil  Who it is they do De  with how is their Correspondence managed and why do they Deal with Good Spirits by Conjurings and the Black Art  THERE remain but two Questions then which have any Difficulty in them to speak to in this Affair of Magick the first is the natural Consequence of what is said before If the  Magician  cannot raise the  Devil  who and what it is he does raise for we will have it that he has Spirits about him If they are not evil Spirits as he will assert in his own Defence what Spirits are they and by what Power or Influence does he maintain such a Correspondence among the Intelligent Beings of the invisible World as to procure those superior Angelick Creatures to appear upon Earth either at his Request or upon such Occasions as he represents to them  There is too much Difficulty I had almost said Absurdity in this Part for us to come into it as the  Magicians  pretend to desire they would  have us believe that all they do is by the Aid and Assistance of these happy Intelligent Beings that they upon the meer Principle of Affection to Mankind and meerly from their Beneficent Nature and Disposition are ready at all times to assist their faithful Agent or Servant the  Magician  in doing acts of Charity Kindness and Benevolence to their FellowCreatures  It is true the  Magician  by this puts a great Compliment upon himself and suggests that he is himself a general Blessing to Mankind and that as such these Generous and Beneficent BEINGS single out them the  Magicians  as the proper Instruments of their Kindness to their FellowCreatures and that they even could not act at least not so fully and effectually without them  That therefore it is those superior Beings are pleas'd to converse with these  Magicians  and communicate to them a superior Knowledge of things making them useful to Mankind and giving them a Reputation for their Wisdom that so the distressed People may apply to them for Assistance Direction and Counsel  But then the second Question is How do they converse with them by what means do those good Spirits come to know when the  Magician  has any thing to be assisted in and in what manner do they claim or desire their Assistance Now the Difficulty of this Question raises a Doubt almost unanswerable against the Truth of the  Magician  's Answer to the first  They tell us they converse with the good Spirits of the invisible World That they would have us take as a first Principle a  Postulatum  that should be granted tho' 'tis pretty much to ask too but to oblige them as far as with any colour of common Sense can be done let us suppose it tho' I can by no means grant it  But how then is it manag'd How is this Converse carry'd on In a word how do they come together It must be either  By the  Magicians  applying to these Spirits for Advice when they want it  Or by the Spirits officiously coming to them upon such Occasions of their own meer Goodness  Or those good Spirits must be always present and to be seen spoken to and conversed with without calling or without seeking to be call'd  I must be so plain with our  Magicians  as to say that I do not see how either of these three can be made out by them nor yet how they can defend themselves from the Charge of Diabolick Magick unless they make out all the three and that very clearly too  As to  Magicians  applying to these Spirits for Advice and Intelligence this I know is their Pretence this they all alledge and when the poor ignorant People apply to them they make a great deal of Ceremony with their Circles and Figures with Magical Books  Hebrew  or  Arabick  Characters muttering of hard Words and other Barbarisms innumerable Just in a word as the old Necromancers do when they consult with the  Devil    Now is there any thing of all this requisite in order to converse with a good Spirit did the Prophets of old use any thing of this Mimickry when they went to enquire of the Lord If they would have their Art be call'd the Sacred Science and we must believe that they converse with Heavenly Beings what need of all these Amusements these Conjurings and Pawwawings  Will they make us believe that the good Spirits are to be us'd as the Wizards and Witches use  the  Devil  that they are to be brought down by Mutterings and Conjurings by Postures and Distortions or as our DancingMasters talk by Grotesque Characters This would do very little to oblige our Reverence Nor to me would it look like any thing but talking to the  Devil    If it is done to put an Amusement upon the ignorant People that come to them and to give a Soleminity as they call it to the thing then 'tis evident it is done to cheat them For what Occasion could there be for such things if they were really about to converse with the exalted Spirits of a heavenly Kind and Inhabitants of the invisible Regions  It is manifest they apply to their invisible angelick Spirits just as the other sort of People do to the  Devil  Their Ceremonies of Address are much the same and when the poor ignorant Stranger seems surpriz'd at it they tell him he should not fear for they are not going to raise the  Devil  granting clearly that there was good reason to suspect it  If they are Honest why then will they not tell us the reason of all these Barbarisms What Cause and what Necessity when they are applying to Heaven to act just as those do who apply to Hell Let them examine History or Antiquity nay let them examine Nature are the Application to God and Idols the same The  Devil  may mimick the Methods of the best Service and seek to be served in the same manner as his Maker but we no where read that ever the Servants of God mimick'd the  Devil  'till now  Let them look at that eminent Time when the Prophet  Elijah  brought himself and the Priests of  Baal  to a Test for the Truth of their Worship  and the Reality of the GOD they worship'd The Idolatrous Priests began their Pagan Rites their Sacrifices were alike that was appointed by the Prophet because they should not say but their Idol  Devil  had equal Honour done him as the true God had in a Proportion But when they came to the Service of the Priests the IdolPriests us'd their Exorcisms their Conjurings their Ecstasies and their Barbarisms leaping up upon their Altars and dancing to their God then cutting themselves with Knives and the like  But when the truly reverend Prophet came to be  n the sacred Office and the Apparatus of laying the Sacrifice upon the Wood was simply performed what did  Elijah  nothing but in a solemn manner and in the Audience of all the People and in the Vulgar Tongue that they might all understand what was said and with a loud Voice call upon the True God to hear him and to glorifie himself in the Sight of the People and God did hear him and magnified his Power accordingly to the Conviction of the People even to the Conviction of their Senses  Bring this down to our Case now Here is a set of Men pretending to consult the good Spirits Inhabitants of the superior Regions and who dwell in the angelick World whereever that is To these they give all the adorable Names they can devise in strange and Outlandish Terms and advance them in their Notions that they may raise the Regard of their wondering but ignorant Admirers  When they have done all this they apply to them just after the Pattern of the Wizards and Necromancers in their enquiring of the  Devil  with Mutterings and Whispers with hard and  exotick Words and unintelligible Speeches as if the good Spirits did not understand  English  s  well as  Arabick  and  Hebrew  or as well as their unmeaning unsignifying  DevilLanguage  a Jargon of their own forming without any real Usage among Men h  such as they please to put upon it  How can this be reconcil'd to the conversing with Good Spirits Intelligent and Beneficent Beings who partake of the Heavenly Nature and are always inclined to do good to Mankind who assist the Indigent and Distressed and protect those that are in Danger direct in Difficulties and are ready on all Occasions to do good Offices and Acts of Kindness to every one  How are they thus ready and beneficent if they are thus to be call'd out of their happy Abodes like  Devils  with Spells and Conjurations with Necromancy and Wizardism Were they such blessed bountiful and beneficent Beings and so ready to help and assist Mankind in times of Difficulties protect them from Evil and from evil Spirits 'twould be but reasonable to suppose they should give some Directions to Mankind how to obtain and procure their Assistance when they want it  It is supposed if these Spirits are such good such beneficent compassionate Beings and so particularly inclined to do good to Mankind I say it is to be supposed they are so by the determinate Appointment of their Creator their Heavenly Father from whose inherent Goodness all good Desires and all good Thoughts do proceed as well in Heaven as in Earth as well in Angels and Spirits as in humane Creatures These good Spirits then if they were such as is pretended would certainly direct Mankind to obtain their Aid by  praying to the Supreme Being under whose Command and Direction they immediately are that they the said good Spirits might be sent to direct assist and protect those that so desire their Assistance  It is a shrewd Sign to me that these Spirits are of another Class and that they do not proceed from Him who is the Author of all Good that they must be apply'd to in such a scandalous manner just as the  Devil  is apply'd to that they take the Honour to themselves of being apply'd to directly and immediately as God himself is and without giving the Honour to God the first Cause and Original Author of all Good and that they at the same time stoop so low as to accept of the like mean and base Methods of being call'd to for Help which are used when we want to raise the  Devil    What do the  Magicians  mean by this uncouth Jargon  I'll go and consult with the good Spirits which I converse with and I'll bring you an Answer  Where are these good Spirits and how do they converse with them If they would say I will pray to God that he may send his Angels or some of his Angels or good Spirits to advise and assist you this had some Sense in it something like the usual Method then when we came to the  Magician  or Cunning Man our Language would be we pray you  Enquire of the Lord for us  and thus it was when God had his good Prophets and his good Spirits to act between his People and him as much as can be suppos'd now  But now the  Magician  instead of saying I will enquire of the Lord for you says I will consult with the good Spirits of the invisible World who I have the Honour to converse with and I will tell you what they say in your Case Here's  not a Word of God or of what he pleases to do or not to do to direct or not to direct but these good Spirts are to teach and direct as if he that made these good Spirits was out of the Question and had nothing to do either with them or us  These things I say render it very suspicious that there are no such things as good Spirts in the Case especially when they are join'd with the scandalous manner of their being apply'd to and if there are no good Spirits and they disown all Conversation with bad Spirits it may be said without Offence tho' in the vulgar way not What the Devil are they doing but What Devils are they doing with  But here is a second Suggestion to help them out and this is that they do not go to converse with these good Spirits by a special Influence calling them to their Assistance but the good Spirits thereby showing themselves to be good and beneficent as has been said condescend to come Voluntier to help and assist counsel and direct in case of the Distress of those helpless Creatures called Men and that they do this officiously by the Assistance of their chosen Servants the  Magicians  who like the Almoners of a great Prince are always laying before their Eyes Suitable Objects for their Help and Benevolence  This is a formal Story and might have some Weight in it if it were not that it wanted Truth of Fact to support it and that this is so we must believe 'till we get the following Difficulties removed The first is How do they know the Condition and Circumstances of those that want to be assisted That these good Spirits must either know it by an infinite Prescience  by which they must every one of them know every thing and that not every thing that is visible to human Eyes and Real but every invisible and imaginary Thing the Thoughts the Anguish of the Soul the Desires Wishes Fears Terrors and Hopes of not only the particular Persons they are to assist but of all People whatever in all Places and Times and on every particular Occasion whatever and to do so would be to be absolutely and essentially God and every one of them separately so a Thought attended with a Heap of horrid Confusions and forming distracted Images in the Mind such as tend to all manner of Blasphemies on one hand or gross Absurdities on the other  The next thing is if the good Spirits cannot by their own Prescience know the Condition and Circumstances of those that may want their Assistance how or by whom must they be or are they informed of it  Now here is the only  Crisis  in which the Magician makes himself necessary for if the good Spirits had joined to so universal Beneficence in their Disposition an infinite Knowledge of all the Persons and their Circumstances who stood in any need of their Help they would then certainly in consequence of the general good Disposition of their Nature immediately apply themselves to the proper Objects and in Compassion to them would relieve and assist them of their own free Goodness and Beneficence not needing the Interposition of any other Agent whatsoever  But now this we do not find but these good Spirits with all the Goodwill which they bear to us yet sit passively still and see all the Miseries of Mankind and all the Distresses which this or that particular Person labours under and perhaps languishes  in and at last lets him perish without the least Help or Assistance  This I think destroys the very Notion of their Prescience or else it must destroy the Notion of their Beneficence one or other must drop they must either not know of the miserable Wretch and his Distresses who wants their Assistance or knowing it they must want a Will or Power to assist and deliver him  But here comes in the Magician and he truly to make himself a necessary Man in his Generation is to be made acquainted with our Distresses and our Complaints and he is to lay them before these good Spirits and procure their Answers in which Case it follows most naturally  First  That those good Spirits are shortsighted ignorant and uninform'd Beings 'till they receive Information from some inferior Hand Thus in short the Counsellor at Law he is ready to give his Advice in the most difficult Case and perfectly qualifyed and able to direct what you should do but he sits in his Chambers in the  Temple  or in  LincolnsInn  and waits perfectly passive in all Business 'till the Client brought by the Attorney or Sollicitor comes to him with his Brief and if the Client does not come he may sit still and be ruined for any Advice or Assistance the Lawyer will give him 'till he is asked Or as the Physician he is Master of his Business able to direct and advise able to pre  cribe a Specifick a certain Cure for such or such Distempers but sits in his Study and stirs not out of his easie Chair to do the distress'd People in his Neighbourhood any good or to help them in their greatest Distress 'till he is sent for and the Case laid  efore him and then he shews his beneficent good Disposition If they have staid 'till the Distemper is  o far gone he pities them and shews his Concern  for them but adds Why did not you let me know his Condition sooner I could ha' sav'd his Life if you had sent to me in time but how should I do him any good when you did not so much as let me know he was sick and thus the poor Patient languishes and dies and the Physician is not blam'd by any body for how should he help him when they did not send to him for Advice or so much as let him know he was sick  Secondly  That the Magicians are a most necessary Generation of Men that without them the miserable World would be robb'd of the Assistance of all those beneficent good Spirits in the invisible World which wait to do us good but cannot apply themselves to exert the good Dispositions they are filled with for want of knowing the Condition and Circumstances of those distressed Creatures which stand in need of their Help and that those Magians being the only Men that converse in that invisible World and hold any Correspondence with the Spirits that are disposed to assist us they alone can hand that Assistance to us being the only People that can acquaint the said good Spirits with our Condition  Thirdly  That therefore 'tis our only Business to cherish and encourage these useful Men called Magicians and to take care that the Race be not extinct and the World deprived of their extraordinary Performances  This would be a noble Doctrine for the Men o  Figures and Circles a Magician would outdo al  the Mountebanks Quacks and Pretenders to infal+lible Remedies in the World they would bring  Law Physick  and  Divinity  into one Head of Pra+ctice and good Spirits inspiring they would cur  the Age of all its Distempers both of Soul an  Body they would resolve all Cases of Con+science  Jure divino  cure all the Incurables in  Guy  's Hospital and make that old 's Charity as useless as his s They would abridge the Practice of the Law to Perfection and bring all the Pleadings at Bar to Chamber Practice the good Spirits would all be Peacemakers and Magicians be general Arbitrators  But this not being at present our Case from hence I venture to conclude that these good Spirits if such there be are not so intimate with our modern Magicians as the latter pretend they are and 'tis to be doubted these carry on their Intelligence with a different sort of Spirits and in a Manage savouring a little more of the Diabolick than the Angelick or  as I said before  with no Spirits at all  FINIS
