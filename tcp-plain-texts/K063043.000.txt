 THE MAID of KENT A COMEDY  Price One Shilling and SixPence  Act  th  Scene  d  THE MAID of KENT  A COMEDY Acted at the THEATREROYAL IN DRURYLANE  LONDON PRINTED FOR G ROBINSON No PATERNOSTERROW AND P NORBURY BRENTFORD  MDCCLXXVIII  ADVERTISEMENT  THREE or four years having elapsed since the representation of the fol∣lowing trifle it will no doubt be thought extraordinary that it should make its appearance in print just at the time when so capital a production as The SCHOOL for SCANDAL en∣grosses all theatrical attention in some degree to excuse the illtiming of this publication the author assures the public that the copyright was disposed of and some sheets of it in the press before that Comedy appeared otherwise they would never have been troubled with this apo∣logy or the cause of it  TO THE LADIES and GENTLEMEN Who by their admirable performance of this first essay and excellent de∣livery of the prologue and epilogue to it obtained such applause to them as in themselves they could not merit The MAID of KENT Is most gratefully inscribed by their much obliged Servant  The AUTHOR  Jan  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr KING  WHEN a melodious lark ascending sings  The wide expanse with shrilly echoes rings  'Till strongly winging his aerial way  To sight he's lost warbling his heav'ntun'd lay  Not so when the young bird first 'ttempts a flight  Emerging from his nest to dazzling light  With flutt'ring pinions halfform'd notes dim'd eyes  From the too pow'rful glare he trembling hies  To some thick wood low copse or shady grove  Where he secure from birds of prey may rove  Where safely he may try his feeble wings  There flits from spray to spray and faintly sings  Patient remains 'till strength and art are won  Then soars and warbles 'gainst the noonday sun  But when he ventures first t'explore the sky  Should criticbuzzard hawk or kite be nigh  Skimming and winding round then on him dart  His beak and talons dig into his heart  No more he sings no more can ever fly  His artless song and self together die  So will it fare with our greenbird or sparrow  If grov'ling found you o'er him draw the harrow  No more he'll chirrup his insipid note  Or vainly gurgle his discordant throat  O loss of lossesne'er to be recover'd  A greenbird in a furrow you have smother'd  But say you're merciful and 'stead of killing  The vent'rous fool to rear him should be willing  Pleas'd he'll crack rapeseed bucket raise of water  T' amuse yourself spouse son and pretty daughter  And while he grunsell picks or chickweed eats  Will chirping thank each gen'rous heart that treats  May learn the linnet's lark's canary's song  His tuneful life if kindly you prolong  And strive each hour t'improve his simple lay  In clearer strains your favours to repay  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Lord

 House  Doctor Goodman  and  Emily  are discovered sitting the  Doctor  shutting a Book they pre∣sently rise  Dr GOODMAN  HERE madam if you please we'll con∣clude the labour of the day  Emily  Call it rather the pleasure of the day sirfor such it is to me I assure youto you indeed sir I fear it must be otherwisethe instruction of a silly girl no doubt is painful and tedious  Dr Good  Pardon me madam I did not call it labour in that sense so far am I from think∣ing it irksome the hours I pass in this our every morning's exercise and the duties of my holy function are the happiest of my lifefor believe me were you my own child instead of my honour'd patron's I could not love you better  Emily  Nor do I think Sir Thomas's affection altho' the best of fathers exceeds the very pa∣ternal regard you have ever been pleased to express for meandI know not whyI  think I feel not a more filial love for him than for yourself sir  Dr Good  Dear madam say not sothe many hours we pass together in our delightful studies beget in you a customary regard think it no more  Emily  Perhaps it is no more sir nay it cannotfor never had a child a kinder parent  Dr Good  Nor ever had a man a truer friend Indeed so general is his goodness he might be a pattern for mankindhe never saw an infant without a parent's fondness or a grey head but like a child he honour'd it  Sir Thomas Richacre  enters  Sir Thom  Ha ha what hard at itWhat is itEthics or mathematics astrology or the∣ology'tis a thousand pities Doctor your pupil is a girl otherwise she would certainly be a bishop in time  Emily  Perhaps not papayou see Dr Goodman with as much piety learning good sense and I am sure as good a heart as any has hitherto attained to no greater dignities than rector of this parish your chaplain sir and my tutor  Dr Good  Were I madam what you are pleased to say of me it does not at all follow I should ever be so exaltedThere are no doubt an infinitely greater number of deserving ministers than there are mitres or even inferior dignities but whoever has attained to that of an honest man will feel that church or state can never raise him higher  Sir Thom  I think so too Doctor and in that respect there is not a more exalted character than yourself  Dr Good  Heaven forbid sir  Sir Thom  But all this while I forget your boy DoctorI made my morning's airing shorter than usual that I might be in the way when he arrivedHe is not come yet I suppose  Dr Good  No sir  Emily  Does young Mr Goodman come home from Oxford to day sir  Dr Good  Yes madam I expect him  Emily  Bless me I thought he was not to have come till next week sir  Sir Thom  Yes yes he'll be here to day and then you may have a new tutor for I suppose you have almost tir'd your old oneI war∣rant by this time he can speak Greek as well as his father what think you Doctor  Dr Good  I not only think that of him sir but were he not my own I could be bold to say he is the most accomplished youth I ever saw and add to thatthe best  Sir Thom  Ay ay George is a good boy ay and a clever one tooevery body says so as well as yourselfbut if they did not the crow you know always thinks her own young whitest ha ha haLet me see  looking at his watch  'tis past onewill the rogue be here to dinner think you  Dr Good  I expect him every moment sir  Sir Thom  Od I wish he was come I have not seen him this ageand are not you glad he is coming Emily  Emily  Yes indeed sir very gladfor I think him a most amiable young man and  have often thought it a thousand pities he is not heir to a good fortune as this idolatrous world of ours still worshipping a golden calf would value him much more for inheriting a fund of wealth than virtuesand a rich cox∣comb is oftner proposed to us poor girls than the most deserving of our affections whose me∣rits are not back'd with that powerful recom∣mendationa great estate  Sir Thom  It's very true my deartoo often the case I must confess  Emily  And I make no doubt but even our ridiculous worthless neighbour Lord Sealand's addresses would be esteemed an honour and plain George Goodman's an affront to most great families in the kingdom  Sir Thom  Why he is a peer of the realm you know  Emily  True papa and there are very few so illbred as to think a coronet may sometimes cover a weak head or a glittering star a bad heart  Sir Thom  Ha ha well said my little sati∣ristWe are to be honour'd with his lord∣ship's company to day at dinner on purpose to see George  Dr Good  His lordship has been always kind enough to take great notice of my poor boy  Emily  That is the only proof of understand∣ing he ever gaveand but for that he would be intolerable with his unaccountable whims and capricesNow own papa don't you think it a strange amusement he has lately taken to keeping sailing vessels to be so often tossing about on the sea as he is  Sir Thom  Why ay child I think it rather too boisterous to be called pleasure but he seldom makes a much longer trip than just across to Calais to furnish himself with some of their knicknacks and fopperies  Emily  Right papa for such a finical wa∣terfly is he that when on shore he lays out more money in powder and perfumes in a week than I fear he gives to the poor in a yearI never see him papa but I think of beau Mizen in the play Ha ha ha  Sir Thom  Well but Emily my dear you of all people in the world should not be so severe upon him he's a very warm admirer of you you know and has almost ask'd my con∣sent to marry you  Emily  He is not a bit more in my good graces for that I assure you papa for could he obtain your consent I believe he'd care very little whether he had mine or not  Dr Good  But Sir Thomas I am persuaded madam will never grant one without the other  Emily  That I confide in sirI suppose I shall be teiz'd to death with his supercilious nonsense to day which he gives me to under∣stand he means for courtship  Sir Thom  And are not you delighted at the very idea of being his ladyCountess of Sealand  Emily  Not I indeed papa lud lud what a character a foppish sailor a compound of tar and civet faughI'd sooner marry our honest Old Metre yonder and be dame to the clerk of the parish  Sir Thom  Ha ha ha here comes the old psalmsinger as fast as he can hobble  Emily  Poor good old man he's worth a courtcalendar full of such lords  Metre  enters  Metre  Your reverence your reverence goodlack I most humbly crave your worship's pardon for my abrupt intrusion  to Sir Thomas  but I come a joyful harbinger As I am a sin∣ner sir your wellbeloved son is just arrived  to the Doctor  Dr Good  Indeed  Sir Thom  Is he faith old Sternhold  Metre  Yes in truth your worship or may I never set another stave  Emity  Looking out  O lud ay he is just stepping out of the postchaisebless mewhat a figure I amII beg pardon sir but in∣deed I can't stayI must go and make myself a little more fit to be seen  Exit  Emily  Sir Thom  Did you observe the girl Doctor  Dr Good  Most heedfully sirand fear  Metre  He approacheth your honours he approacheth  Sir Thom  Ay here he comes sure enough  George  enters  George  Your blessing sir  kneeling to Dr Goodman  Dr Good  Heaven grant thee grace  George  My honour'd patron my second fa∣ther  to Sir Thomas  I can't resist an impulse that throws me at your feet and bids me beg your blessing too  Sir Thom  Heaven bless and preserve you my good lad  George  My dear father forgive this transport I fear it hurries me into a neglect I'd sooner die than willingly be guilty of butthis meeting overpowers medon't be offended sir  to Sir Thomas  at the frankness of a poor lad like meindeed I am very happy to see you sir I hope both you sir and my dear father are as well as  Sir Thom  Well odzookers who can be ill and look such a ruddycheek'd rogue as you in the facefaith you look bravely my lad and a devilish handsome young dog you are grown rare work I warrant he has made at Oxford Doctor how many dozen have you left crying their eyes out eh George  George  You are merry sir  Sir Thom  Well butjoking aparthave you left ne'er a little tender soul breaking her heart after youa sweetheart eh George for I'll engage you have got one boy  George  To what end sir so young and un∣provided for as I amBut excuse me sir for interrupting you by hoping Miss Richacre is well  Sir Thom  Ay Emily is pure hearty and as reserv'd as yourselfShe wont confess the power of the little blind boy any more than you  George  The longer she is sir before she makes her choice we may reasonably hope the better it will beBut I believe sir she may wait long indeed before she finds one to de∣serve her  Sir Thom  Odzookers George that's a civiler thing than ever I heard Lord Sealand say of her with all his courtship  George  Lord Sealand  aside  II hope sir I do not offend in speaking my sentiments so freely  Sir Thom  Offend no no boyI like you the better for speaking your thoughtsI wish all mankind did so they would not be the worse for it  Metre  Then with your worship's indulgence I can withhold no longerAs I am an unwor∣thy sinner sir  to George  I am more delighted to behold you than a full congregation and that is the delight of my old heart  George  What my good old friend nothing but my extreme joy at seeing my honour'd pa∣rent and protector could have made me over∣look youI am very glad to see youI hope you are well  taking Metre kindly by the hand  Metre  In troth the better for seeing you well sir  wiping his eyes  George  Ah my old playfellow "Thou hast born me on this back a thousand times"  Metre  And a pleasant load thou wert my ever gentle taskmaster he he heand in like sportful sort although I am waxen old I hope to live to bear your tender offspring  George  No my poor Yorick time will I fear bear you away first  Sir Thom  Not so neither Georgefor as my mother used to say to me those eyes of yours will make many a pretty girl's heart achso don't be timorous lad but look about you and if you take a liking to a girl let her be who she may attack her boldlyI am a  whimsical old fellow and if I take it into my head may make you worth her having  Dr Good  Sir I fear your goodness will  Sir Thom  Pho pho be quiet Doctoryou know I am not like too many in the world easily talked out of a good design or into a bad onebut tell us George sincerely now we are upon the subject have you really ne'er a sweetheart at Oxford  George  No I assure you sirI never saw a face there that made the least impression on me  Sir Thom  And you are heartwhole ha  George  As when I left this house sir  sighing aside  Sir Thom  Why how have you pass'd your time lad always at your studies  George  Pretty constantly sirthe only re∣turn in my power for your great bounty to me was the making a proper use of itBut if I may be so bold sir I think you mentioned something of Lord Sealand's having paid his addresses to Miss Richacre  Sir Thom  Ay George I believe I might  George  But I think sir you said too that Miss Emily had not hitherto confess'd any particular inclination  Sir Thom  Why nobut he's very rich and when a suitor is both wealthy and noble you know  George  Very true sir  Metre talks apart with Dr Goodman  Sir Thom  Not that I believe Emily likes him a jot better for those accidental advan∣tages as she calls themShe and I are much of a mind about him for in my opinion  he is but a frothy kind of a spark like too many of the present ageand it is paying you no compliment George to say such a lad as you are is worth a score such as Lord Sealand  George bows respectfully  Dr Good  I fear sir what you are pleased to say of my poor boy will make him vain  Sir Thom  Vain of what such an old fellow as I say no noIf Emily had said as much indeedbut Doctor I must rob you of George's company a littlecome boyyou must go and ask my girl how she isshe'll be glad to see you I'm sureShe just saw you alight and scamper'd away to set her cap strait or some such important matterCome along my boy and I'll promise you a kiss for your pains  Exit  Sir Thomas Richacre  George  Will you excuse me a few moments my dear sir while I pay my respects to Miss Richacre  Dr Good  Ay ay attend Sir Thomas by all meansmeantime I'll step and see a poor cottager hard by who Metre has just been telling me is very ill  George  You are as humane as ever sir heaven bless you  Dr Good  And you too my dear boy  Exeunt  Dr Goodman  and  George  severally  Metre  Amen and heaven be with you both for such a father and such a son are hardly to be parallel'dNo marvel his good worship is so well pleased in yehe whese benignity extendeth even unto my unworthy self and my poor child Martha whom he hath most benevolently reared as waitingmaid  unto his fair daughter from childhood even unto womanhoodand in commiseration of my forlorn condition when my loving help∣mate Rebecca departed this transitory life bountifully took me to end my days in peace in his most hospitable mansion  going  Emily  and  Patty  enter  Patty  Lord ma'am there's nobody here but my father  Metre  Whom seeketh her good ladyship Martha  Emily  I thought Mr Goodman had been here  Metre  No madamhis reverence is gone to visit the afflicted  Emily  O noI don't mean the Doctor but George GoodmanI met his father this mo∣ment and he said he was this way  Metre  Good madam I most humbly crave forgiveness for my misapprehensionmy dearly beloved young master departed hence but even now indeed to accompany his worship in order to pay his most dutiful respects unto your ladyship  Emily  Run Pattytell my papa I came down the other stairs and am here  Metre  So please your ladyship  I  will ac∣quaint his worship forthwith  Emily  Thank you Mr Metre  Metre  I long for the sweet young pair to meet methinks  Would it might be never to part again  That I devoutly pray and to it addAmen  aside  Exit  Metre  Emily  And so Patty you did see him you say  Patty  Yes ma'am I just had a peep at him as he passed thro' the hall and he did look so handsome you can't think  Emily  I wish you are not in love with him girl  Patty  Ah madam if I was as much his betters as he is mine I'd soon tell him a piece of my mind  Emily  Why really the youth's not amiss I had a glimpse of him myself and think him considerably improved I must confesshis complexion more florid and air more lively than when he left us  Patty  Ay ma'am that he is more lively and more lovely too than ever and so you would say ma'am I am sure if you spoke your thoughts  Emily  Indeed and pray how came you so well acquainted with my thoughts  Patty  Why ma'am the dressing glass dis∣covered them to mefor you have look'd more in it since you knew young Mr Goodman was arrived than ever I knew you in all my life beforeAnd I'll be whipt if you don't wish to appear as handsome in his eyes as he does in yours  Emily  O you wicked girl how can you say so  Patty  Indeed ma'am if I was as rich as your ladyship and we were both at our own disposal I fancy we should puzzle the poor young gentleman which to choosefor his choice he might have that's certain  Emily  And in that case you think he'd be puzzled which to choose  Smiling  Patty  O dear ma'am I had quite forgot one thingthat isIf I was as beautiful as your ladyship  Curtsying  Emily  O your ladyship's most obedient  curtsying  and so you have quite forgot your sweetheart William  Patty  Williamyesno ma'amthat is O gemini ma'am here the sweet gentleman comes as sure as a gun  Emily  Eh what where  confused  Sir Thomas Richacre  and  George  enter

words I would have utter'd if I couldmay I flatter myself so far as to think  Patty  O yes indeed sir you may flatter yourselffor my lady and I are both very glad to see you  Sir Thom  Hold your tongue you chatterbox I don't know any business you have here  Patty  Dear heart sir I did but just speak ChatterboxI wish I had been as cunning as some folks and held my tongue I might then have been kiss'd a little as well as some other people  aside  Emily  Pray papa excuse hershe always seem'd to have so great respect for Mr Good∣man and was so desirous now of seeing him that I gave her leave to come with me  Metre  enters  Metre  So please your worship the right honourable the Earl of Sealand is just alight∣ing from his gilded chariot  Sir Thom  I'll go to him directlychildren I'll leave

gentlefolks' discourse an evesdropper fie for shame get thee gone about thy business that's my good girl  Patty  aside  Psha fiddle faddle how provoking this is now I am sure I sha'n't get a kiss  Exit  Patty  Metre  to Emily  Your honour's very hum∣ble servant heaven bless you my sweet young master  George  And you too my good old friend  Metre  Just such a lovely pair were those first formedah would your conditions were as equal then might I hope ere long unto your nuptial benediction most joyfully to cry Amen  Exit  Metre  Emily  smiling  What a whimsical old soul it is  George  But exceeding kind and honestat least to mehe knows no bounds to his good wishes for my welfarewhich is all I can say in extenuation of his freedom now to you madam  Emily  O the wellmeaning good creature cannot easily offend me  George  Have a care dear madam your condescension don't destroy the respect I should preserve  Emily  Let me beg of you to forget those distant words respect and madamour com∣pliments are over tho' with much difficulty  smiling  let us now resume that innocent fa∣miliarity we were bred together in and ever were delighted withwhen we parted last you was less ceremonious then instead of madam you call'd me your Emilynay more your dear Emily  George  That I still might without a crime for sure there can be nothing dearer to me  Emily  Then why this distancethis reserve  George  O Emily think but of your con∣dition your rank in life and think of mine  Emily  And shall that lay a restraint upon our lipsmust they be denied to express what our hearts will feel forgetful of distinc∣tion  George  What my heart feels they can't ex∣pressgratitude love admiration all the most susceptible can feel or eloquent describe is thereMy dearest Emily still I must call you sowhy are you thus kindthus conde∣scending  Emily  In what'prithee now where is the mighty difference between us is not your father in every respect but the lowest of all considerations riches as good as mine and wherein can I pretend to vie with thee who art an abstract of both their virtuesbut we grow seriousbesides you have to dress and see that odious Sealand which this detains you from so 'till we meet at dinner dear George adieu  Exit  Emily  George  Adieu sweet Emily lovely en∣gaging bewitching Emily O that I were but rich enough to dare aspire to thee never did I repine at want of fortune but on thy account and when I find that the only bar to my success I must repine since were I not the child of poverty and dependance what might I not hopeher partiality for me I think is evidentand my determination to conquer this illsuited passion she has in one moment utterly destroyed  he stands musing  Patty  enters  Patty  I gave my father the slip nicely and here he is yetand alone too that's charming Now who knows but I may have better luck than I had before  aside  Pray sir is not my young lady here  George does not observe her  Hoity toity why he's speech∣less againmay be he is always so when he wants to kiss a pretty girlI wish Sir Thomas wou'd pop in his head and cry as he did just now kiss her boy kiss her again  aside  Sir Sirpray

of mankind  aside  Exit  George  Patty  Not one kiss by jingo I could cry for madness I suppose he's proud and thinks himself too much above memarry come up and yethe is a pretty gentleman and if I was as rich as a jew I'd marry him directly Staylet me considerI have got a little money by me that my father knows nothing of if I don't buy a lotteryticket I'll be burntand if I get the twentythousandpoundprize nay if I am so unlucky as to get only the tenthousand I'll tell him my mind directlyand sure then he won't think himself above me I've heard say that in London the gentryay even your lords and dukes now and then marry poor girls that are prettylike me for  lovenay tho' I hardly know how to believe it folks say they'll sometimes take up with their own ay or other people's keptmadams and I am sure it wou'd not be a quarter so bad as that for a parson's son to marry a clerk's daughter  Exit  Patty  End of the First Act  ACT II  Scene  Sir Thomas Richacre's  GardenA Summer House in view  Metre  comes out of the Summer House  William  meets him carrying a Chair  WILLIAM  HERE master Metre here be another chair and now it be all right I believe there be two for madam Emily and young master Goodmantwo elbowones for Sir Thomas and his reverence and this gilded da∣mask one you bid me fetch for my lordbut ecod if I was his worship I'd set upon it myself  Metre  Ha ha hawell put it into the summerhouse with the rest that's my good lad  William  Never stir if I don't believe it be made of lead it feels so plaguy heavythof I suppose I only think so 'cause I fetch'd it with an illwillfor to be sure I did grudge my labour most confoundedly  Metre  Why so William I never knew thee idle yetWhy so  William  Why because I don't like unand it goes mortally again' the grain with me to do any thing for such a scapegracefor as the ould saving behe is like the wind at east good to neither man nor beast  Metre  For shame William for shame you should not speak so disrespectfully of a noble∣man  William  Nobleman why I hope master Metre you don't think such a whiffling chap as Lord Sealand deserves to be called noble I'll be judg'd by yourself now if he be one crumb like his worship or a quarter so noble thof he be no more but a knightbarrowknight  Metre  I profess William I do not think this light young lord so deserving of his dig∣nity as our nobles in general are said to be which maketh me most heartily wish he was more like his worship's honour than he is  William  More like un I'll be shot an' he be a bit like unno more than a crabapple be like a goldenpippin I wonder for my part nay for that matter so do the whole neighbourhood why such a good gentleman as Sir Thomas keeps company with him and lets him come dangling here for ever a'ter young madam like a tantonypig  Metre  Why thou knowest William his lordship hath a great estate adjoining to his worship'sand although he hath it not in his will I fear to do much good it is in his power to do a great deal of harm therefore  I conjecture his worship holdeth it prudent to keep friends with him  William  More the pity I say master Metre that what few good men there be in the world should be obligated to truckle to the bador that any one should have a good estate that has not a good heart likewise  Metre  William thou art an honest righ∣teous lad I verily believe and although it hath pleased heaven to place thee in so hum∣ble a station the uprightness of thy heart would adorn the princes and the rulers of the land more than their costly raiment precious stones purple and fine linen  William  Thanks to your kind opinion master MetreI do hope I shall never prove no other∣wise  Metre  I am morally certain thou wilt not hold forth thy handthere is a shilling for theeand I will bestow upon thee too a do∣nation of good books particularly the Old and New Testament the Liturgy with thereunto annexed the Old and New Version of the Psalms of David done into English Metre  William  'Thank you kindlyodsbobs I shall be quite set up  Metre  Moreover I will recommend thee unto his reverence to succeed me in my holy office upon my demise  William  What me to be clerk and sexton oh lord  Metre  To qualify thee for which important undertaking I will instruct thee in every thing appertaining unto a clerkshipparticularly in psalmodylikewise how to adapt as well as  set a staveand eke also both audibly and emphatically to cry Amen  William  I shall soon learn for I know all the notches already and can give the key with the pitchpipe and sing fol fa with e'er a he in the parishand as to Amenno offence master Metre I hopebut I could say it twice as laudable as you do  Metre  Audible thou would'st say William and audibly did I use to say itbut alack∣aday I am waxen old and my voice is im∣pairedbut when I was thy agehem Aamen  Speaking as loud as he can  Wil∣liam  puts his hand before  Metre's  mouth  William  Odsbobs here comes my lady  Emily  enters  William  carries the Chair into the Summer House  Metre  is going  Emily  recalls him  Emily  No not herewhere is my George what can have become of himMr Metre  Metre  Did your good ladyship please to call  Emily  Are you going into the house pray  Metre  Unless your ladyship hath occasion to send me elsewhere  Emily  No only be so good to tell Patty I want to speak with her  Metre  I will communicate your ladyship's pleasure unto her incontinentlyAh when young I had a voice like any belland as the old song sayeth could dig a grave and set a stave and say Amen full well  aside as he goes off  Exit  MetreWilliam  returns and is following  Metre Emily  calls him  Emily  William  William  Ma'am  Emily  Step to the cottage below our gardendoor in the greenlane I am told the poor labourer there is ill and the family in great distressgive this to the poor woman  gives money  and be careful not to mention it to any body else I charge you  William  No indeed ma'am I'll never open my lips about it but when I'm praying heaven to bless and preserve your ladyship's goodness  Emily  Run then William as fast as you can and go out at the gardendoor that none of our family may see you  William  Yes ma'am I willI'm sure I should not think this a heavy load if it weigh'd as much again as the gilt chair for I should like to be so employ'd from one week's end to the other  Exit  William  Emily  What a humane creature such good∣ness must not go unrewardedHow diffe∣rent are our natures this uninstructed boy possessing virtues too seldom met with in the most exaltedWhat then avail a pompous title wealth and illustrious ancestry since the meanest peasant possessing but humanity has no superior while the heart that cannot feel for others' woes disgraces not only a distin∣guished rank but even our very nature  Patty  enters  Patty  Did you want me ma'am my father said  Emily  Yes Patty my papa intends passing the afternoon in the summerhouse so order coffee and tea to be served there  Patty  Yes ma'am  going  Emily  Pattyhave you seen any thing of young Mr Goodman since dinner  Patty  Yes ma'am I saw him steal slily by the hall windows a little while agoI don't know where he went but I have a notion he has seen some trollop in the neighbourhood as he came along in the postchaise that he has taken a liking to and is gone in search of and I'm sure that's a shame when he might pick and choose out of the two prettiest in the whole county  Emily  Why Patty this is love in downright earnestI'll be whipt if you have not quite forgot poor William and are jealous of this young gentleman  Patty  Jealous not I indeed ma'amWil∣liam is worth a dozen of himyoung gentle∣man he don't behave like one that's what he don't for he has not once had the good manners to offer to salute me since he came home  Emily  Poor Patty that is provoking in∣deed  Patty  Yes ma'amI believe you'd think it was if he had serv'd you so  Emily  Indeed ha ha ha why I wish you are not jealous of me next  Patty  No ma'am I am pretty secure there if I really did like him well enough to care about himfor your ladyship being heiress to so many thousand pounds a year he would  never dare to make love to you ma'amand I hope ma'am setting case you was weak enough to like the poor lad you'd never demean yourself so much as to tell him so  Emily  I don't know that Patty for setting case as you phrase it I lik'd him I should make very little scruple of confessing it  Patty  Indeed lord lord how little pride some people have If I was a baronet's daughter I'd never think of taking up with a poor clergyman's son when I might marry a lord and be a countess  Emily  A mind like his would reflect a lustre upon the meanest origin and I desire Patty you would restrain this freedom nor make so free with Mr Goodman's name again  Patty  Dear heart ma'am I did but just speakand I should not have said what I have had not your ladyship ask'd me about himif I am a little jealous of him there's somebody to the full as jealous of me  Emily  How I am tormented with this silly girl while my mind is rack'd with a thousand apprehensions  aside  Patty  You wanted coffee and tea serv'd in the summerhouse I think you said ma'am  Emily  Yes child  peevishly  Patty  Child goodlackayshe is in love with him as sure as a gun as well as myselfI'm sure I won't buy a lottery ticket since that's the case for 'twou'd be only throw∣ing my money away  aside  Exit  Patty  Emily  Heyday what ails the foolish girl I wish she is not jealous in good earnestand what's the matter with the other foolish  girl I wish  she  is not more affected than she oughtfor were I certain George was absolutely gone upon the errand Patty men∣tioned I believeI should not be very well pleas'dbut it cannot betherefore be still my heart poor frighten'd fool nor throb and flutter without cause  William  reenters  William  Ma'am I ha'run as hard as ever I cou'd and the poor souls send their duty and ten thousand thanks to your ladyshipbut blessed be providence they say they don't want any money now  Emily  How so William  William  Why ma'am what d'ye think when I went into the cot who should I see sitting by the sick man but young Master Goodman and thof the poor soul be so bad 'twould ha' puzzled a stranger to tell which of the two ail'd most young gentleman look'd so piteously  Emily  Indeed was young Mr Goodman there  William  Yes indeed ma'am  Emily  My mind's at rest again  aside  William  And the poor woman told me he had been there a good while and had writ a description to be made up at 'pottecary's for her husband and had guve 'em money to pay for it and more to buy victuals with and kiss'd the sweet babes and was so kind to 'em nothing could be like it  Emily  The dear the amiable youth how could I wrong him by my late ungenerous fears  aside  William  And when I came out ma'am who should I see but his worship and Dr Goodman and they ax'd me what I had been doing there and what I was crying about for to be sure young gentleman's goodness had made my eyes water a littleand when I told 'em I wish I may never stir if their honours did not almost cry too  Emily  And where did my papa and the doctor go William  William  Why where do you think they went ma'am  Emily  Nay how can I tell  William  I am sure it made my heart dance with joy to see such a grand gentleman as Sir Thomas Richacre a knightbarrowknight justice of peace and quorum stoop to go into a poor hovel like that  Emily  What the cottage you had just come out of  William  Yes indeed ma'aminto poor Quickset's little hutbut I cou'd not see Lord Sealand thof I look'd all aboutand if he had gone along with their honours his coat wou'd not ha' set the worse on his back o' Sunday as the saying beaxing your lady∣ship's pardon  Emily  Indeed William I am entirely of your mindbut if I was not why do you ask my pardon it is not me you are speak∣ing against  William  Noa madam mercy forbid it's out of any one's power to say ill of your lady∣ship  but it be rife all over the parish that your ladyship's going to be married to my lord and there's not a living soul but what pities you for your ladyship's as much be∣lov'd as my lord's hatedand to be sure that's not a little  Emily  Well William I am not married to his lordship yetand 'till I am you need not fear offending me by such remarks  William  Thank your ladyship's goodness does your ladyship please to want any thing else  Emily  No 'thank you William not at present  William  aside as he is going  Now I know the poor souls don't want for any thing if I can but coax Patty into a good humour I shall be as happy as a kingOdrabbit it I axe ten thousand pardons but if I had not like to ha' forgot to remember to give your lady∣ship the piece of gold again I'll be shot  Emily  William you are a humane good lad and shall not want encouragementkeep it yourself as an earnest of what I may do farther for you  William  'Thank you kindly and heartily ma'amit be more your goodness than my desert  aside  now I'll run back again to the cottage t'other way and watch 'till their honours be gone in at garden door then make the poor souls have the money whether they will or not  Exit  William  Emily  Married to Lord Sealand I shudder to hear it mentioned whence could such a report take rise from himself or from Sir  Thomas sure my dear father kind to all be∣sides will never single me out to be cruel to and as he does nothing without his worthy friend's advice surely the good the pious Doctor Goodman never can approve it why should I fear thenand yet I do the bare idea that it is possible makes me tremblegracious heaven how dreadful is my present situation demanded by a worthless insolent I detest hopeless of him I cannot chuse but love Oh George where is the spot or what the condition I should not think a paradise with thee rather than share a king∣dom with Lord Sealand  Lord Sealand sings without  Heavens here comes the hateful wretchlet me endeavour to conceal my agi∣tation  Lord Sealand  enters  L Sealand  Emily my divine creature how could you be so cruel to leave me to mope and grow stupid for want of your animating brilliancy and vivacity 'twas abolutely bar∣barous carissima mia  Emily  Those are qualities my lord I am not happy enough to possessbut surely 'tis impossible for Lord Sealand ever to be grave whose animating brilliancy and vivacity would dispel the gloom of a Greenland winter  L Sealand  O you flatterer but perhaps you really think sodo you my adorâble make me happy by confessing it  Emily  I dare say your lordship has not the least doubt but every body thinks so  L Sealand  Mia bella Signora I see you doI read it in those eyes whose brightness I adore more than the beacons on the Southforeland when I am returning from Calais in a hazy evening  Emily  Calais bless me does your lordship ever venture so far  L Sealand  Far O child that's nothing to me who have even had thoughts of sailing up the Baltic or crossing the Bay of Biscay mere∣ly to kiss the empress's fair hand and the pope's great toe and for a kiss of those di∣vine lips I would explore the NorthEastPassage nor think I flatter you my angel when I swear that neither flip when I am aboard or capillaire ashore are half so dear to me  Emily  You do me great honour indeed my lordbut does your lordship ever taste the li∣quor they call flip  L Sealand  Taste it ay many a can do I toss off when I have my watchcoat and trow∣sers on and am turning to windward in a brisk galebut the flip I drink is not like the vile stuff commonly so call'd for mine has a most delicate flavour as I always mix it with capillaire  Emily  Well it is amazing to me what could induce a person of your lordship's delicacy to venture upon this dangerous amusement you have lately taken a fancy to  L Sealand  Why faith mia cara I com∣menced sailor merely to avoid the imputation of effeminacytho' if we meet with any bad weather at sea I immediately retire to my  cabin and order my pilot O'Connor to make for land with all convenient speed  Emily  Ha ha ha you are perfectly in the right upon my word my lord  L Sealand  But let us change the coarse indelicate subjectI am almost tir'd of the scheme and another seasickness will make me drop it I believepray what's become of George first he walk'd offthen you mia crudel deserted usand soon after Sir Tho∣mas ask'd me to go with him to see the sick fellow old Goodman was speaking ofas if I had been a physicianwhich I declining he took away Domine and left me to indulge in soliloquy just as I was concluding our marriage ma chere upon honour I have not been treated so politely ever since I lodg'd with Mynheer VanderDunder the fat Burgomaster at Rotterdam  Emily  Concluding our marriage did you say my lord  L Sealand  Si Signorawe were on the very brink of settling the preliminaries  Emily  Why does your lordship really sup∣pose we are to be married  L Sealand  Is it possible you can still make that a question have not I told you repeatedly I would marry you my angel  Emily  But did I ever consent to marry your lordship  L Sealand  Consent egad I don't recollect I ever ask'd youon purpose to spare your confusion in consenting as I am sure my adorâble will  taking her by the hand  Emily  Perhaps your lordship may be de∣ceiv'd  George  enters  George  What do I see Emily and Lord Sealand hand in hand distraction now I am lost indeedbut she seems averse to him why then should I tamely give her up what is his fortune title birth to me I have a mind as noble name as fair tho' unadorn'd with honours and possessionsbut I rave and if perceiv'd shall be thought a mean list'ner to their converse  retiring  L Sealand  Ha George where have you been you runaway in some dull arbour I suppose poring over your musty Greek  George  I beg pardon my lord for this ac∣cidental intrusion  L Sealand  O you are come quite oppor∣tunely to help me soften the rigour of this obdurate fair one  George  I shall be but an indifferent advo∣cate for love my lordit is a language I have not been used to talk  L Sealand  Pho pho tell me something mon∣strous tender now out of your Ovid Catullus Tibullus or any of the soft amorous dogs suited to the extreme violence of my passion  George  Were I in your place my lord I should rather follow their example than barely repeat their wordsthey never said any thing to the object of their wishes but what was dictated and inspir'd by love itself  L Sealand  Ay that's truebut a rough tar as I am can't be suppos'd to have so many  fine expressions ready on these occasions as you studying rhyming sonneteers and Lady Sea∣land like a tender mother would never suffer me to read or study much for fear of spoiling my eyes or making my head akecome do now say something monstrous clever for me and in the mean time as I fancy my dad that is to be is return'd by this I shall go and make you happy my angel by concluding the treaty with him  Emily  My lordbe not so precipitate I intreat your lordship  L Scaland  He I am sure will be no less proud of the honour of having me for a soninlaw than you my charmer are to have me for a husbandtherefore mia cara sposa think what day will be most agreable to you for the celebration of our nuptials but for your own sake as well as mine let me intreat you not to delay our felicity too longAddio jusqu'au revoir Addio mia contessa carissima fa la la c  Exit  Lord Sealand  singing  George  Insolent reptile  Emily  Now had I not a father more attentive to the happiness than grandeur of his child I should be completely miserableOh Georgel do not think lightly of me for this declaration I'd sooner beg with thee than shine in all the splendor this wretch's utmost power could place me  George  Dearest Emily think not of me had providence design'd us for each other my lot in life had been more suited to your birth as it is tho' I have presum'd to love I never cherish'd hopefor not even to gain  thee Emily would I abuse my honour'd pa∣tron's confidence may you sweet maid but meet one more deserving while I pray heaven to bless and to protect you  Emily  Do not talk sothee only can I love to thee only will I ever give my handI am sure my father will never force me to marry Sealand or any one against my willand perhaps some blessed moment may incline him to prefer my poor but virtuous George  George  No more no more sweet Emily I cannot bear it  Emily  Well we'll drop the subjectpray did you see Sir Thomas just now where you have been  George  Where I have been  Emily  Yes at the cottage down the lane William told me all  George  Did hebut 'tis no great matter for the poor woman  told me all  too when she return'd from the door whither William had taken her to deliver your benefactionand likewise that Sir Thomas and my father were talking with him in the lanewhereon sus∣pecting they were coming there I quitted the cot immediately and return'd another way un∣perceived by them  Sir Thomas Richacre  and  Dr Goodman  enter  Sir Thom  Why George where hast been lad I have been seeking you  George  Sir I was only  hesitating  Sir Thom  Come come never blush at a good action that's a false shame and almost as wrong as not to be asham'd of a bad one I know  where you have been and how employed Your charity is sterling I am sure without that too common alloy of ostentationand so is your's my dear good girlbut pray have you seen nothing of my lord lately Emily I expected to have found him here for when I ask'd him to go with me he declin'd it say∣ing he'd walk a turn or two in the garden with you till I return'd  Emily  He was here just now papa and after addressing me in a most insolent manner saying he was sure both you sir and myself would be  proud  of his alliance he left me as he said to conclude the treaty with you  Sir Thom  He did ha O come along I'll conclude it presently  Emily  Sir I hopedear sir  to Dr Good∣man  speak to my papafor heaven's sake in∣tercede for me  Dr Good  Don't alarm yourself dear madam Sir Thomas will do nothing contrary to your happiness or inclination I am certain  Sir Thom  What's the fool frighten'd at  Emily  You said sir you'd conclude this hateful treaty  Sir Thom  Why ay so I will  George  Then I am lost indeed  aside  Emily  Is it possible sir must your poor Emily be made a sacrifice  Sir Thom  Heyday what the plague's the matter with the girl I'll conclude itput an end to itbreak it off you foolwhat can I say more to please you I'd sooner marry you to William or old Metre than the first duke in the land if he had no better a heart than Lord Sealand  Emily  Then I am happy  George  And I  aside  Patty  enters  Patty  Ma'am Lord Sealand sent me to beg the favour of your ladyship to come and play a tune upon your harpsichord till Sir Thomas return'dwhich as you came in the garden way his lordship did not know you was sir  Sir Thom  A tune ehay ay we'll go play him a tune directlyI'll soon put you out of your pain I warrant youfor when he hears what must be known before you marry any one and what I believe I shall now tell him I fancy he'll give over the chace of his own accord  George  Heavens what can that be  aside to Emily  Sir Thom  If he does not you will perhaps think better of him than you do at present and willingly be Lady Sealand  Emily  Never sir I am certain  Sir Thom  Well well there's no knowing we shall seego children go before us  George  Come my sweet Emily  Emily  What can my father mean  aside to each

you  Patty  Yes you can't be much nearer I think in her very arms how near wou'd you be I wonder  aside  George  Your brother  Patty  What  aside  George  Then there is no hope indeed  Patty  No I hope notbut what can this mean  aside  Emily  Pattyhow long have you been here  Patty  I am but this moment come madam Sir Thomas sent me to desire your lady∣ship  Emily  O Patty you must forget those words I am no lady now  Patty  No ma'am how so  Emily  No longer heiress to a splendid for∣tune but sister to this much lov'd youththe  virtues of a reverend parent must be now our joint inheritance  George  But to what purpose Emily was you bred up as daughter to Sir Thomas  Emily  He told Lord Sealand there was a reason for it which time perhaps would shew and in addition to my misery after my lord had left us said he was pleas'd at his refusal of me having all along intended I should still keep the name of Richacremeaning no doubt with my concurrence to marry me himself  George  Astonishing yet that accounts for all  Patty  Good gracious I hardly know how to believe all thisI am afraid she's only jok∣ing  aside  lord ma'am I hope you an't serious all this timeare n't you Sir Thomas's daughter indeed  Emily  No Patty you have lost your mistress  Patty  aside  I have found a husband in the stead tho' and that's ten times betterbut I must seem sorryDear heart ma'am I am vastly concern'd to hear this for you was very good to me and I must never expect to have so many nice cloaths given me again un∣less his worship should really be so kind as to marry you himself ma'am  Emily  Happy happy girl 'would I had no greater grief than thine  Patty  Why to be sure ma'am the black ox has trod upon your foot a little as the say∣ing isand one misfortune seldom comes alone as the other saying isyou have been very unlucky indeed ma'am to lose a great fortune  and your sweetheart too both at oncefor I do verily believe you had a kindness for Mr Goodman before you knew he was your bro∣therbut now that's all over  aside  'Thank my kind stars and I shall be Mrs Goodman as sure as fate  George  No Patty it is not all over  Emily  Nor will be but with life  Patty  Lord ma'am why sure you wou'd not love your own brother  Emily  Not love him who shall debar me that  Patty  Nay ma'am I only just spokefor brothers and sisters did formerly marry I grant or the world could not have been peopled but that's quite out of fashion now you know ma'amunless indeed you had been roman∣catholicpapishes and were lucky enough to be Sir Thomas's children instead of Dr Good∣man's because I have heard say if people have but money enough the pope will grant a compensationI think they call it or some such hard name I suppose it means an act of parliament for a man to marry his own grand∣mother but indeed ma'am if I was you I'd think no more of my brother but take Sir Thomas at his word and marry my father that is as he is  not  your father  Emily  Prithee have done Patty I am not yet reconcil'd enough unto my fate to bear this illtim'd mirthI might nay perhaps I  shall  find refuge in a cloyster and dedicate my future wretched life to heaven  George  No Emily 'tis I should be seques∣tered from the world you have been taught to look for happiness and by accepting of Sir  Thomas's most worthy hand and noble fortune yet may find it  Emily  Impossible oh name it not again never will I basely take the hand and fortune I cannot in return for give my heart  George  Forgive me dearest maid nor think I had any view in what I said but your repose and welfare for what little patrimony my honour'd father may have gather'd for us both shall now be wholly yours as I will immedi∣ately enter into holy orders devote my life to a religious celibacy nor ever think again of love or womankind  Patty  O goodness heart that will be a great pity sir for there's many a pretty girl I dare say would be proud to have you  Emily  Come my dear brother let us attend Sir Thomas and our father I promis'd to fol∣low them directly  George  Our father oh Emilymy sister I cannot bear the thoughtit shocksit overpow'rsit mads memy sweet Emily go you while I endeavour to compose this agitation of my spirits before I see them  Emily  May heaven restore you to your peace of mindbut mineis lost for ever  Exit  Emily  George  sits down musing  Patty  after some little pause  Sirsirsir  George  What do you say child  peevishly  Patty  Why sirI hope you won't be angry at such a simple girl as me offering to advise youbut really I would not have you think of living single for to my certain knowledge there is a girl in the world ay and a good  pretty girl too that's not far off would be very sorry you shou'd die a batchelor  George  Which I most surely shall  sighing  Patty  Mercy forbid sirfor indeed you are a very pretty gentleman and seeing as how you and your sister can't conveniently come together if I was in your place I shou'd look about me a littleand if such a thing was to happen that you even took a fancy to  me  sir I don't think I could find in my heart to be cruel to youand tho' I am not your equals you might go farther and fare worse for I have a little money by me and a pros∣pect of getting a very large sum soonand you know sir I am a sort of an heiress as I may call it besides and I dare say my father has sav'd something worth having  she stands curt∣sying and simpering to him  George  How this silly girl torments me I had better check her or the giddy creature may suppose I know not whatI thank you Patty for your good will to me  Patty  Thank you Patty O gemini I be∣lieve he'll come to at last  aside  George  But hope you'll not deceive yourself into what might hereafter prove a trouble to you  Patty  No indeed sir it never wouldso far from it every thing I did for you wou'd be a pleasure to me  George  Still you mistake me my good girl  Patty  Good girl O the dear soul I shall have him as sure as a gun  aside  No in∣deed sir I don't  George  Pray hear me without interruption  Patty  Yes sir that I will  curtsying  for to be sure I cou'd hear you talk for ever  George  I am afraid you have conceiv'd some∣thing like love for me  Patty  Like  love indeed sir if a poor bash∣ful girl must speak outit's love in downright earnest  curtsying very low  George  Pray don't interrupt meyou have entertain'd I say a partiality for me you mis∣take for love and which a return to might pos∣sibly confirm in you but as that can never be I intreat you for your own repose in time to check it and never think again of what is im∣possibleOh love thou tyrant o'er the heart how contradictory are thy decrees  Exit  George  Patty  Impossible why is it impossible sure  I  am not his fister toolord lord that any body

recommendation of fortune tho' he cou'd not by offering her a husband not much inferior to himself who will love her and protect her  George  reenters  George  Have you seen my sister sir  Dr Good

Patty  Indeed your worship my poor father has been running all over the parish seeking for young madam 'till he is almost dead  Sir Thom  Well and has he found her  Dr Good  Oh no no no  Sir Thom  Why

way did you go Doctor  Dr Good  I went first sir to Lord Sealand's house  Sir Thom  Psha that I know already for I was there just after youwhat could induce you to go there you might be sure enough he would not carry her homewhich way did George go  Dr Good  I know not sirheaven will I hope direct him better  Sir Thom  He can't have worse luck than I had go which way he willfor so far from a coach or a chariot I could not see so much as a cart or a wheelbarrowbut come comedon't let us stand chattering herelet us go look somewhere or other  going  O'Connor  speaks without  O'Connor  Hilli ho my heartswhat cheer honieswhat all under hatches tumble up tumble up my jewels  he enters  By my  soul this is the strangest vessel I ever stuck foot aboardthe devil a hand is there walking deck to keep watch so fait I e'en made bold to take a peep into the cabin  Sir Thom  Who the devil are you sir what do you want here  O'Connor  Arrah be easy my jewel don't put yourself out of your latitude and you'll know who I am presentlybut why won't you station a hand upon deck yonder to keep a bit of a look out or you may be boarded by a landpirate honey  Metre  Go Martha and make fast the door child  Patty  Dear heart I am almost afraid this strange man is come to run away with  me  aside  Exit  Patty  Sir Thom  What's your business what do you want of me  O'Connor  What do I want with you the devil a toothful do I want of you but a little civil discourse nor that neither unless you are the commander here  Sir Thom  Well sir I am the commander as you call itWhat then  O'Connor  Why thenI'll lower my topsail to you honey  pulling off his hat  Sir Thom  Butwhat's your business for I'm in haste  O'Connor  Why you are to know joy I am just come full sail upon the outside of a horse with another in tow from the saltseashore to bring you advice of a sweet cratur a female young woman belonging here and my master Lord Sealand  Sir Thom  Lord Scoundrel  O'Connor  Indeed you may say thatmore pity the two words should ever be splic'd to∣gether  Dr Good  But your news sir your news  O'Connor  Why you must know I receav'd orders from Mounseer Powderpuff my lord's walleydeshaver to have our skiff ready to carry my lord and the young woman I mention'd aboard our cutter the Tarquinbut I soon found by her unwillingness that she was not a volunteer of her own accord but had been press'd into the sarvice without giving her con∣sent to itso faith I began to be a little queer with my lord about it for the sweet cratur look'd as innocent as a sucking dove ay or a newborn dove's egg and I determin'd not to aid and assist at making her otherwise  Dr Good  Eternal blessings on you for your goodness  O'Connor  Devil a goodness in the case honey 'twas no more than the duty of every honest man that is not a rogue  Sir Thom  Give me your hand my heart of oak I am your friend for ever  O'Connor  So while we were raving and squabbling within half a cable's length of land a good clever likely young jontleman and a carrottypated liveryservant came galloping and splashing into the saltsea as if they were riding post over to France or Holland for their horses were fairly afloat and half way to the skiff in the turning of a handspike  Sir Thom  So friend  O'Connor  Hollo you young harebrains says Ihave a care you don't run foul of our  little nutshell and spill us all upon which the poor girl cry'd out it was her brother  Metre  Her brother  O'Connor  Devil fire me says little Brian O'Connor that's myself if their beasts shall board us and send us to the bottom if he was your brother and sister too but do you hear young jontleman says I have a little wit in your folly and don't fink your friends and your foes together but take in a reef a two and we'll be alongside you presently  Sir Thom  That was right friend that was right  O'Connor  Upon which you may take your swear my bugofalord did all he could to prevent my carrying the boat ashoreand at last when he found nothing else would do nor that neither was trying to hussle me overboard  Metre  Was it possible  O'Connor  Indeed it was notfor as soon as I perceav'd it Oho thinks little Brian are you for that fun I'll be bound I match you to a tittle my jewel so upon my conscience I made no more ceremony but gave him as pretty a genteel lift as you shall see in a sum∣mer's day and capsiz'd him souse headlong into the wet ocean where he look'd for all the world like the gold and filver fish folks keep in glass washingrubs  Sir Thom  Ha ha ha well done well done i'faith  Metre  But notwithstanding his demerits he was not drowned sir I hope  Sir Thom  There we differ old Stave for oncefor I hope he was  O'Connor  No faith sir as ill luck would have it he was not drown'd  Sir Thom  The more the pity say I  O'Connor  Upon my conscience sir you say very rightit was God's mercy and a thousand pities sure enough but I take it he was a little damp or so for when he scrambled ashore the salt brine ran from him by pailfuls  Sir Thom  Ha ha ha ha I shall burst I shall burst upon second thoughts I am glad the dog was not drown'd for if he had I should have been kill'd outright  O'Connor  Yes fait and so would he too  Dr Good  But how ended the matter pray sir  O'Connor  O it was soon over honey for when I had thrown the whale into Jonas's belly  Metre  Jonas into the whale's belly I apprehend you mean sir  O'Connor  Well the whale into Jonas or Jonas into the whale it's all one an't it when I had given my lord a summerset I say and spilt him into the ocean we got ashore presentlybut as the young jontleman was hoisting his sister out of the boat his draggletail'd lordship lent him such a pat o'the cheek as was enough to break his hand∣some face or put one of his forecastle lights out  Sir Thom  The cowardly villain but he re∣paid it I hope  O'Connor  Och I'll be bound he didand with interest toofor he had the honour of horsewhipping his lordship to his heart's con∣tent and by way of premium I divarted  myself the mean time with beating his impu∣dent French walleydeshaver  Sir Thom  Bravo bravo ha ha ha but what became of the liveryservant all this while sure he was not idle  O'Connor  What the lad with the bunch of carrots growing on his head indeed he was notfor he had no sooner handed the poor frighted girl out of the gangway and brought the two horses  they went  and  I came  upon to an anchor but the tight lad beseag'd the coachbox took it by storm and is now piloting the young jontleman and lady safe into port here aboard my lord's own chariot fait leaving him and his rascally companions to pad the hoof and trudge home upon their ten toes  Sir Thom  Odso then let's go meet 'em they can't be far off by this and I long to see the dear rogues again  going  hark sure I hear a carriage stop  Patty  enters hastily  Patty  My lady's come back sir my lady's come back young Mr Goodman and William have found her and they are all come back together  Metre  Rejoice and sing kill the fatted calf and be merry for the lost sheep is found  George  and  Emily  enter  She runs to  Dr Goodman Sir Thomas Richacre  catches  George  in his arms  Sir Thom  My dear dear brave boy thou'rt welcome home again  Emily  to  Dr Goodman  O my lov'd sire scarce did I know my father ere I was torn from him but am restor'd thank heaven to his paternal arms  Dr Good  Thanks gracious providence I see my child again  Metre  Amen  Sir Thom  Odzookers George I have been in a plaguy pucker about you you rogue  George  Sir I am eternally bound to you for this solicitude And was not my dear father exceedingly alarm'd  to  Dr Goodman  Sir Thom  Alarm'd why I tell you I have been almost out of my wits about you both  George  Sir I am bound to you for ever but my dear father  to  Dr Goodman  is not  he  happy too that my sister his sweet daughter is safe restored  Sir Thom  Ay that he is I'll answer for himand as you have so bravely help'd to recover a daughter for him the least he can do in return is to provide you with a father by restoring me my son  George  Sir what does my patron say  Sir Thom  Sayecod I don't know what to sayonly that in having you for my heir I am father to one of the best and bravest lads in the kingdom  George  Father  Sir Thom  Yes my dear boy I am indeed your father George your father  embracing him  Odzookers Doctor I could contain my∣self no longer faith  Dr Good  Dear sir he is your own and truly worth the claiming  Emily  Indulgent powers is it possible  aside  Patty  O good gracious ma'am here's good news for you  aside to  Emily  Metre  Wonderful wonderful most won∣derful  George  Am I in a dream  O'Connor  Upon my conscience I can't tell but if you are you have had a very pleasant ride in your sleep  George  Dear sirs what am I to think within these few hours I thought myself the son of this worthy divine and this sweet maid your daughter sir  to  Sir Thomas Richacre  we then were wretched beyond idea supposing our∣selves the issue of one parent and now sir  Sir Thom  And now my dear boy all is set rightyou are my son my own flesh and blood at least your mother Lady Richacre who was a pattern of conjugal fidelity told me soand Emily is as surely Dr Goodman's daughter  George  kneels to  Sir Thomas  who raises and embraces him  Emily  Transporting sounds then we may yet be happy  aside  O'Connor  Devil burn me but this makes out the old saying goodthat it's a wise father knows his own childO no fait I don't mean so neithertho' that may be true too but it's a wise child knows it's own father  George  Most honour'd parent  to  Sir Tho∣mas  if I really am so blest may I presume to ask why we have both been bred in such a mutual error  Sir Thom  I'll tell thee GeorgeI had ob∣serv'd with great concern how seldom young men bred in the insolent pride of inheriting great estates deserv'd themI am a whimsical old fellow you knowand therefore proposed to and prevail'd on my respected friend as we became widowers almost together to join with me in a project I had formed in imita∣tion of the Spectator's Leontine and Eudoxus of exchanging children for a timehoping thereby to render you more worthy than you might otherwise have been of the fortune and title you was born tothe experiment was a singular one I own but the event has fully justified it  George  bows  George  And sirif I dare ask one question morewhat recompence did you purpose to this young lady for being deluded with such an imaginary grandeur  Emily  Bless me what is he saying  aside  George  Was it to realize the golden dream  Sir Thom  Why I had some such notion indeed George  George  If I remember right the story you alluded to sir the good the generous Eudoxus join'd the young and loving pair is that my sire's intention or which I dread to ask is it tomarry her yourself  Sir Thom  Ha what marry Emily myself bless her dear little heart heaven forbid no no I had a younger spark in my eye for her  Emily  Benignity itself he means my George I'm certain and I shall yet be blest  aside  George  Then sir I may speak plainer  Emily  What will the dear youth say  aside  George  And declare that I am vet a beggar if you add not to my late acquisition of for∣tune the supreme delight of restoring this lov'd maid to the station she was bred in by per∣mitting  me  still to call this best of men my father  Sir Thom  What do you ask me for she's none of mine you fool why don't you ask the Doctor  George  to  Sir Thomas  My indulgent fa∣ther  to  Dr Goodman  O sir either my behaviour has hitherto been unfilial or you will kindly receive me for your son again  Dr Good  My ever dearest sontake her and may heaven shower down eternal blessings on you both  Metre  Amen  O'Connor  Ay and so be it too say I  George  Now if my Emily thinks me not unworthy  Emily  O talk not so 'tis I that am unwor∣thyyet whereforeif desert consisted but in riches then I were indeed deficient but conscious of a mind superior to the distinctions of birth and fortune I feel that I deserve your love for had our conditions really been as we imagined preferring thee the worthiest to the most wealthy I should have gloried in my acquisition more than in a conquest of the most exalted  George  I know it my sweet Emily I know it  Emily  And if my preserver loves like me he will not ask but take my trembling hand  assur'd that he possesses wholly my fond my beating heart  George  Thus then I take thy snowy hand here seal my faith  kissing her hand  and hence∣forth we are one  O'Connor  Ay and a very pretty splice you have both made on't  Emily  to  Sir Thomas  I have so full a sense sir of your most unexampled goodness in first adopting your poor girl and now confirming thus your favour I cannot thank you as I oughtlet these duteous grateful tears speak for me  falling on her knee  Sir Thom  Rise rise my sweet child you are my daughter now indeed  raises and kisses her  O'Connor  wiping his eyes  Well I wish I may never taste another cheekful of beef and biscuit or a sup of grog again if this is not as pretty a piece of business  George  My good friend the preserver of my Emily amid these several transports I have too long overlook'd you  O'Connor  Och no offence gra I have been overlooking you too 'till I don't know what ails me fait but I've a notion the saltwater that spalpeen of a lord splash'd in my face when I tilted him overboard had not got out of the corners of my eyes before for some drops trickled down the scuppers of my cheeks into my mouth just now that tasted quite brackish they could not be tears sure for tho' we Irishmen are apt to make blunders a  weatherbeaten chap like myself would not cry sure at what he's so well pleas'd with  George  You have a double title to my gratitude as I receiv'd assistance from you against your own master not fearing in the cause of virtue to offend the wretch you serv'd  O'Connor  I'll tell you what honeySaint Patrick be thankful I'm never afraid of doing what's rightfor tho' I'm but a menial man of low degree I am sprung from a very great offspring and have got the thick blood of the kings of Ireland bubbling in my veins joy and in my foolish way of thinking so far from offending I sarv'd my master most faithfully by not sarving him at all at all in such an unjontlemanlike undertaking  Sir Thom  You are a right honest tar and shall never serve any one again while you live  O'Connor  Indeed and I will always sarve both you and yours with all the blood in my bones  Emily  How or in what words shall I ex∣press my very fervent thanks to you for hav∣ing sav'd a helpless creature from what I dread to think of  to  O'Connor  O'Connor  I'll tell you how you shall thank me jewel by holding your sweet tongue and never saying another word about it  Emily  Generous man my deeds shall then speak for me  Patty  Dear father now every thing else is settled so nicely do pray put in a word for poor William  Metre  And yourself eh Martha  Patty  If you please father  Metre  Well I will adventure to address their honourshem hem good your wor∣shipand good your reverencethis seem∣ing an auspicious hour your poor old servant hath an humble boon to crave  Sir Thom  What is it old silverlocks  Metre  That it may please your honours when the bans of matrimony are published between my dear and honourable young master and mistress as I trust his reverence will not approve they should be married by licence the names of my poor child Martha Metre spinsterand her chosen spouse and helpmate William Strongbow batchelor both of this parish may be permitted most humbly to follow  Sir Thom  William Strongbow what young carrottypoll where is the redheaded rogue I have not seen him since he scal'd the coachbox  Patty  He is in the hall I believe father  aside to him  Metre  William Strongbow approach his worship's presence  William  enters  William  Did your worship please to want me  Sir Thom  Ay come hither WilliamI am told you have behav'd like a man of Kent to day in helping to rescue my maid of Kent here from Lord Sealand and his myrmidons  William  I did my best an't like your wor∣ship as I was in duty bound  Sir Thom  And likewise that you and Patty want to make a match together  William  If your worship and his reverence please to give us leave  bowing  Dr Good  What say you Patty  Patty  William has spoke my mind your honours  curtsying  Sir Thom  Why then marry away you young rogues as fast as you can you have my good∣will  Metre William  and  Patty  I humbly thank your wor∣ship  Dr Good  And mine  Metre William  and  Patty  I humbly thank your reve∣rence  Dr Good  And I pray heaven to bless and prosper you  Metre  Amen  Sir Thom  And in reward for your service to day I'll make a man of you my boy  William  I most humbly thank your noble worship's honour and goodness  George  And with your leave sir I will give Patty a little portion  Patty  'Thank you kindly sir and may you and my dear young lady be as happy together as you deserve  Emily  I thank you Pattymay you  to  Patty  and  William  and every virtuous pair be no less so  Metre  Amen  William  And now Patty we shall be as merry as grigs or as midsummerday is long  Patty  That we shall William and I long for the wedding to be over that instead of plain Patty I may hear myself call'd Mrs Strongbow  Sir Thom  Now I believe all parties are re∣warded and satisfied except the poor Quicksets and they too shall partake the happiness they by the timely alarm given us were in great measure the means of and never be poor or want for any thing again unless it be health and that the richest of us can't bestow And so every thing is settled and we are all hap∣py are we not old boy shake hands my heart of oak what say you  O'Connor  Why sir I saythe honour of wagging a fist with you wou'd make the happy if I was ever so miserable but I'm after think∣ing the young jontleman and his little sweet∣lips there ay and t'other young couple too won't be quite easy 'till they have shook hands and been splic'd together in church fait  George  The idea transports memy Emilymy destin'd bride we now approach the height of human bliss blest as we are in the paternal care of these our best of fathers the affections of our faithful friends and ser∣vants and the fruition of our mutual disin∣terested lovethe vices of that miscreant lord you happily was delivered from are pu∣nished by an indelible disgrace while the  virtues of this circle are rewarded with a per∣fect and I hope 'twill prove a lasting felicity  Metre  AMEN  The END  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Miss YOUNGE  OUR silly author fain would have me speak  Something I understand no more than Greek  His epiloguewhich he sure thinks as fine  As if inspir'd by Phoebus and the Nine  Such moral lessonssage instructive rules    Drawn from learn'd folios and the antient schools  Morals said I the

your scene be laid  Tell us of coteries or a masquerade  Of such materials epilogues are made  Yet still he begs that I would plead his cause  And say "the piece conforms to critic laws  In scene time action and his further plan  To draw men as they are not more than man  Some good some bad"thus tritely on he ran  Preach this yourself for me sir I replied  An epilogue I want where may be tried  My
