NOBLE ORDER OF THE GARTER LORD LIEUTENANT OF IRELAND c c c IN TESTIMONY OF UNALTERABLE ESTEEM AFFECTION AND GRATITUDE THIS TRAGEDY IS INSCRIBED BY HIS GRACE'S MUCH OBLIGED AND MOST OBEDIENT HUMBLE SERVANTâ–ª  ROBERT JEPHSON  DURLIN CASTLE  April    PROLOGUE  Written by EDMOND MALONE Esq  Spoken by Mr KEMBLE  FROM Thespis' days to this enlighten'd hour  The stage has shewn the dire abuse of power  What mighty mischief from ambition springs  The fate of heroes and the fall of kings  But these high themes howe'er adorn'd by art  Have seldom gain'd the passes of the heart  Calm we behold the pompous mimick woe  Unmov'd by sorrows we can never know  ar other feelings in the soul arise  When private griefs arrest our ears and eyes  When the false friend and blameless suffering wife  Reflect the image of domestick life  And still more wide the sympathy more keen  When to each breast responsive is the scene  And the sine cords that  every  heart intwine  Dilated vibrate with the glowing line  Such is the theme that now demands your ear  And claims the silent plaudit of a tear  One tyrant passion all mankind must prove  The balm or poison of our livesis  love  Love's sovereign sway extends o'er every clime  Nor owns a limit or of space or time  For love the generous fair one hath sustain'd  More poignant ilis than ever poet feign'd  For love the maid partakes her lover's tomb  O  pines long life out in sad foothless gloom  Ne'er shall Oblivion shroud the Grecian wife  Spectant subeuntem fata mariti  Alce  tem JUV    Who gave her own to save a husband's life  With her contending see our Edward's bride  Imbibing poison from his mangled side  Nor less though proud of intellectual sway  Does haughty man the tyrant power obey  From youth to age by love's wild tempest tost  For love even mighty kingdoms has he lost  Vainwealth and fame and Fortune's fost'ring care  Thou art slave whom Fortune's tender arm  With favour never clasp'd  T  r  or of Athen      If no fond breast the splendid blessings share  And each day's bustling pageantry once past  There only  there his bliss is found at last  For woes fictitious oft your tears have flow'd  Your cheek for wrongs imaginary glow'd  Tonight our poet means not to assail  Your throbbing bosoms with a fancy'd tale  Scarce sixty suns their annual course have roll'd  Since all was real that our scenes unfold  To touch your breasts with no unpleasing pain  The Muse's magick bids it live again  Bids mingled character as once in life  Resume their functions and renew their strife  While pride revenge and jealousy's wild rage  Rouse all the genius of the impassion'd stage  Persons Represented  Duke of  Genoa  Mr PACKER  Durazzo  a Nobleman father of  Julia  Mr BENSLEY  Mentevole  a young Nobleman in

THE ITALIAN LOVER A TRAGEDY  ACT I  SCENE I  A Platform  Enter  MARCELLUS  supporting  MANOA  Attendants behind  MARCELLUS  LOOK up sir you are safe The tempest's wildness Seems hush'd on shore Where was your vessel bound  MANOA  Ancona was her port the hurricane  Baffled our pilot's skill and drove us headlong  Just as your ship made good her anchorage  On the sharp rock where you beheld her split  All my companions fifty luckless men  Sunk in my sight and I had shar'd their fate  Had not your strong arm sav'd me But alas  We are in Genoa if mine eyes deceive not  MARCELLUS  The fame  MANOA  Too well I know it Shield me Heaven  For what am I reserv'd  MARCELLUS  I hope to lose  The memory of your grief and find peace here  MANOA  O no to lose my life if I'm found here  MARCELLUS  Pray let me know your story By your habit  I guess you are not of our faith or nation  MANOA  I am by birth of Syria but here sojourn'd  Twice twenty years in wealth and fair repute  Till Christian malice or my nation's curse  Or both combining turn'd me forth a wanderer  Look there that very mansion once was mine  MARCELLUS  I now recall some traces of that face  Your name is Manoa  MANOA  Ay that wretch am I  Thou hast an aspect to benign and noble  Thou could'st not injure me  MARCELLUS  Myself much sooner  MANOA  This state for its late levies 'gainst the Turk  Call'd on all traffickers for sums of gold  Our tribe at my persuasion furnish'd them  On rates so easy to the borrowers  The native merchants' offers were refus'd  And publick clamour and disgrace pursued them  Thence grew their hate Of black and monstrous crimes  Avouch'd on oath by witnesses suborn'd  They charg'd me guiltless flight alone was left  To save my hunted life  MARCELLUS  And I remember  'Twas rumour'd you had perish'd by the sea  Attempting your escape and so believ'd  Knaves call'd your fate a judgment  MANOA  To prevent  A hot pursuit the Hebrews here in Genoa  By common concert spread abroad that rumour  The death they feign'd this morning but for thee  My brave preserver had indeed o'erta'en me  MARCELLUS  I can do more to serve you Name your wish  MANOA  At present this Not far from hence resides  The lord Durazzo whose great wealth and power  As heaven sends dews and sunshine are dispens'd  To gladden every humble thing beneath them  Let your men help me there for I am feeble  And this disguise may save me from the note  Of those who passthough in this slothful city  Few leave their down so early  MARCELLUS  Sir farewel  You shall hear more of me  MANOA  Accept my prayers  My heart's too full to speak the thanks I owe you  Exit  MANOA  with Attendants  MARCELLUS  He has been sorely wrong'dBut who goes there  CAMILLO  passes over the stage  I cannot sure mistake him 'Tis Camillo  Good kinsman turn and own a friend who loves you  CAMILLO  returns  SCENE II  CAMILLO MARCELLUS  CAMILLO  A gentle invitation Ha Marcellus  Welcome once more to Genoa my dear cousin  embracing  We heard you had escap'd with some slight hurts  That bloody lingering business there at Candia  But such fierce storms of late have swept our coasts  Our fears were lest the angry elements  Leaguing alike against the Christian cross  Might prove worse foes even than the infidels  MARCELLUS  We had rough weather but our sturdy bark  Outrode it Is my mother well At leisure  I shall fatigue your ear with other questions  My ignorance and your kindness must excuse  CAMILLO  You have not seen her then  MARCELLUS  No I arriv'd  Within this hour and knowing how she lov'd  Lov'd even to dotage my poor brother Claudio  Lost by a fate so strange and horrible  I would not rush at once into her presence  Till some kind friend like you should first inform me  How best to assuage her grief and hide my own  CAMILLO  Thought like a son But O his vanish'd form  Again presented in your living likeness  Will with the strong extreme convulse her soul  And joy so mix'd with anguish doubly shake her  MARCELLUS  'Twas what I fear'd Camillo I must try then  To fix her fond attention on myself  And shun that direful theme  CAMILLO  Direful indeed  How my heart shrinks even now think of it  'Tis ever present to her tortur'd fancy  And we who daily see her have observ'd  Our care to give the current of her thoughts  A different course but swells up her impatience  You know the lady Fulvia's ardent temper  How sudden yet how strong in every feeling  MARCELLUS  Our burning mountains when their fires burst forth  Rage not more fiercely than her breast inflam'd  But is it possible in all this time  Months after months elaps'd no light no spark  To guide to a discovery has been trac'd  The Turkish gallies so o'erspread the sea  My letters rarely reach'd me while at Candia  CAMILLO  What have you heard  MARCELLUS  But thus much and no more  Two days ere that for his intended marriage  With good Durazzo's daughter lovely Julia  Was Claudio missing two days more were pass'd  In fruitless search and sad anxiety  When on the fifth some weary mariners  Flying for shelter from a furious storm  Midst the white caverns on the western shore  A mile from Genoa found his lifeless body  In his clench'd hand was his own bloodstain'd sword  And in his manly breast a mortal wound  CAMILLO  And there ends all our knowledge Proclamation  Of vast rewards to find his murderer  Is still abroad through all the Italian states  The untouch'd jewels of his costly habit  Bright and conspicuous clearly manifest  'Twas not the crime of men who kill for spoil  MARCELLUS  Alas Camillo well I know the place  When we were boys it was our favourite haunt  He could not sure have fall'n by his own sword  CAMILLO  Impossible A thought so black and sullen  Ne'er dim'd the sunshine of his chearful breast  The joy he long had sigh'd for in his reach  Possess'd of all that gilds the morn of life  And each fair prospect bright'ning to his hopes  Besides the exalted tenour of his mind  Too firm and full for wild extremities  They crush that black conclusion nay the skilful  Who search'd the wound with closest art and care  Pronounc'd it not the execrable work  Of his own sword but some assassin's steel  MARCELLUS  May wakeful conscience like a writhing snake  If still he lives curl round the villain's heart  With sharpest venom to consume and gnaw him  I know our base Italian stabbing spirit  In the close art of murder none excell us  We read the very earth breathe the same air  With our old Latian fires but for their virtues  As well might eagles rustle their large plumes  Where owlets roost or filthy kites engender  As they find shelter in our dastard breasts  CAMILLO  Let others rail but thine's a nobler task  To shame desen'racy by fair example  For twenty forward spirits like thine own  Might shake this state from its inglorious trance  And rouse our sloth to gallant enterprise  MARCELLUS  I left it a luxurious worthless city  of its trash its wealth if such I find it  I will not strike my lazy root at home  To rot in rank contagious apathy  But seek again a scene of vigorous action  The unskilful perseverance of the Turk  Still wakes excitement for a soldier's ardour  But who are those to earnest in discourse  This way they move  CAMILLO  Durazzo is the eldest  MARCELLUS  Fair Julia's father him I know The other  CAMILLO  Mentevole his name a noble youth  And suitor hopelessly I think to Julia  Though vulgar fame calls him a favour'd wooer  But this report startling your mother's ear  Who brooks no slight to her son's memory  Has much estrang'd her from Durazzo's house  And thus the bonds of their long amity  The lie with many mouths has puff'd asunder  MARCELLUS  My care all be to reunite their friendship  But how must I esteem Mentevole  CAMILLO  As one accomplish'd brave and liberal  Soon after your departure for the siege  He came from travel home and was to Claudio  A second self  MARCELLUS  So shall he be to me  I'll wear him here But go thou to my mother  Prepare her for my coming For a moment  Leave me to greet this venerable lord  And beg his introduction to the stranger  Exit  CAMILLO  SCENE III  To  MARCELLUS DURAZZO  and  MENTEVOLE  The ruddy hue your visage owns my lord  I see with pleasure is sound health's true ensign  Your eye's quick spirit too proclaims you fresh  As when the race of careless youth began  DURAZZO  Such is your wish Marcellus and I thank you  O welcome to thy country thy smooth cheek  Has chang'd its down for manhood since we parted  But for these wellknown kindred lineaments  I scarce durst swear thou wert that playful boy  Whose frolicks used to mar our gravity  And make us smile while chiding  MARCELLUS  I remember  Your goodness always now entreat your favour  To recommend me to this lord's esteem  As by the title of my brother's friend  He claims already mine  DURAZZO  Mentevole  Give him your hand  MENTEVOLE  My heart too 'twas his brother's  And by that pledge grows thus at once acquainted  DURAZZO  Marcellus you must tell me of your wars  Your mines your sallies ambuscades and dangers  Though now 'tis long since I was cased in steel  The cresent of our swarthy foe has felt me  MARCELLUS  They are slugglish soldiers but right obstinate  So numerous too it seems an caller task  To kill than count them Now twice fifty thousand  And more have fall'n in sacking one poor isle  Yet like light foam chaf'd by the curling surge  Each hour new turbans whiten round its shores  But yet I have not visited my mother  And she by this expects me  DURAZZO  Get thee to her  Unhappy lady may your presence cheer her  Exit  MARCELLUS  SCENE IV  DURAZZO MENTEVOLE  Is he not like to Claudie  MENTEVOLE  Rather say  Is't not himself as ere the tomb receiv'd him  But dear my lord by all that charm'd your youth  Forgive me though I seem importunate  O win your daughter to accept my vows  For I have lov'd to such a mad excess  So stor'd up every thought of happiness  In that fond hope should I prove bankrupt there  I dare not look to earth or Heaven for comfort  DURAZZO  Mentevole I doubt not of your love  My daughter too believes it a feign'd passion  Speaks not your fervent language  MENTEVOLE  A feign'd passion  Thus hear me swear  DURAZZO  Oaths are unnecessary  My tongue has not been niggard of your praise  I've tried entreaties too A harsh command  Heard with repugnancy that she should love  Because her anxious father deems it meet  Or you would have it so might change at once  The indifference you complain of to aversion  Thus the calm lake that slept at peace before  Turns a strong tide and sets against your wishes  MENTEVOLE  O the degrees my lord are infinite  Between a harsh command and such persuasion  As every day the fondest parents use  In tender strife with a coy maid's reluctance  Were I to plead as a feed advocate  Even for a scanty rood of barren earth  I should account me faithless to my charge  My rhetorick o'erpriz'd at one poor ducat  Did I neglect a gloss or argument  Might sway the unwilling judge to my decision  DURAZZO  Instruct me to speed better I shall thank you  MENTEVOLE  My words my action should have life and grace  I'd probe his reason try his every humour  Wind to his inmost soul grow to his eye  Watch where impression stole upon his sense  There ply my strength where most I found him weak  Nor cease to urge till I had conquer'd him  DURAZZO  Passion thus blindfold sees no obstacle  Young man young man be calm a while and hear me  MENTEVOLE  Yet tell me not my suit is desperate  Sooth though you cannot heal and I will listen  As if I liv'd by every sound you utter'd  And death and inattention were the same  DURAZZO  You knew long since to see my daughter wedded  Without a variance 'twixt her choice and mine  Was my prime wish Malignant destiny  Marr'd that fair prospect The assassin's stab  Had almost pierc'd with one pernicious stroke  Two faithful breasts Anguish unutterable  On her soft frame lay'd such a deadly grasp  Too long I trembled for her life and reason  MENTEVOLE  Spare me my lord O spare me the remembrance  It harrows me too deeply  DURAZZO  Can you question  I wish to see her unavailing sorrow  Chang'd to gay festivals and bridal joy  Or think you that supinely I can view  Thus childless but in her my house's honours  My large estates sunk in a virgin's tomb  Or scatter'd 'mongst remote and thankless kindred  When by alliance with your wellmatch'd love  Such near and natural heirs may spring to bless me  MENTEVOLE  Why grant it all yet how have I prevail'd  My presence she endures for you desir'd it  Yet if the only theme can touch me nearly  But trembles from my tongue her cheek turns pale  Her blood runs back as mustering to her heart  To fortify the access more strong against me  I pity him who thinks he has known distress  And never felt the pang of hopeless love  The consummation of all other ills  Is light and trivial to that misery  DURAZZO  Time may do much nor shall my aid be wanting  Urge me no more nor doubt me Your kind sister  Olympia the companion she holds dear  May unobserv'd watch every soft approach  And steal a lover's image on her fancy  But lo she comes Farewel I go to serve you  Exit  DURAZZO  SCENE V  MENTEVOLE  alone  He goes to serve me Let his feeble breath  Turn ice to fire wake in her frozen bosom  Such hot consuming flames as I feel here  O I could sluice my veins mangle this form  This common form that wants the power to move her  SCENE VI  To him  OLYMPIA  Tell me Olympia are not women woo'd  By constancy and deepprotested oaths  By living on their smiles by nice attentions  By yielding up our reason to their humours  By adoration of their beauty's power  By sighs and tears by flattery kneeling fawning  Tell me how many ways a manly mind  Must be debas'd to win a lady's smile  OLYMPIA  That which by baseness only can be gain'd  Were better undesir'd But say good brother  Why do you question with such angry haste  And what strange fury ruffles all your mien  Give me your hand it burns You are not well  Your mind unquiet fevers thus your blood  MENTEVOLE  No no a woman's coldness Your fair friend  Teach her to smile and my distemper dies  OLYMPIA  She has no sense of joy that beauteous flower  Bows its sweet head o'er Claudio's bloody grave  MENTEVOLE  Must that eternal sound grate on me still  Hast thou been faithful to me Hast thou told her  How thou hast seen these lids even at her name  Swell with unbidden tides or melting fondness  Whole nights how I have fill'd thy patient ear  And she my only theme How many times  When chance has given her beauties to my sight  Thou hast beheld me trembling try to speak  And gaze away my meaning  OLYMPIA  Nay my lord  Endeavours true as mine disdain suspicion  And let me say if she should ne'er consent  MENTEVOLE  How's that take heed if she shou'd ne'er consent  Put not my life on chilling supposition  Make it the doubt Olympia of a moment  And though thou art my sister and a dear one  By heaven I almost think that I shall hate thee  For here I swear deeply and calmly swear it  The hour which sees me desperate of her love  S  l be my last  LYMPIA  For shame be more a man  MENTEVOLE  By the great power which gave me sense and being  I'll wrest from fate my folly's chastisement  And this right hand shall end me  OLYMPIA  Oh how shocking  To hear with what devout impiety  Thou dar'st call heaven the witness of an oath  Outrageous to its own bless'd providence  MENTEVOLE  Well be it as it may I have sworn it  Knows she that young Marcellus is arriv'd  OLYMPIA  Yes and the pleasing tidings for a moment  Dispell'd the cloud that dim'd her beauteous eyes  Instant she beg'd me and with warmth unusual  To bear her greetings to his mother Fulvia  I now was on my way  MENTEVOLE  Then bear thy message  Go be the agent to destroy thy brother  This compliment I know is but the prelude  To invite a second Claudio in Marcellus  OLYMPIA  If peace be worth a wish and love be such  In every other bosom as in thine  Let the short story on my gravestone tell  "Nor loving nor belov'd Olympia died"  MENTEVOLE  You never wish'd more wisely but forgive me  Pardon my infirmity 'tis too like madness  OLYMPIA  'Tis worse for madmen have their intervals  Thine's an eternal rage  going  MENTEVOLE  Go not in anger  Return I will be calm return Olympia  Thus on my knee let me entreat you hear me  offering to knee  OLYMPIA  Pray rise We may be seen What is't go on  MENTEVOLE  I have a neverfailing instinct here  Which prompts me what to dread This young Marcellus  OLYMPIA  Well what of him  MENTEVOLE  I know will see her shortlyâ–ª  Crowd all thy faculties into thine eye  Read his reception keenly mark  him  too  And give me note of every circumstance  Their words their looks let not a glance escape thee  Promise me so and from this hour Olympia  Thy prudence shall be my sole counsellor  Though you enjoin me to be blind and mute  I'll bear it patient as the tutor'd child  Whose fond instructor smiles and teaches him  OLYMPIA  Keep these conditions and command my service  I linger here too longRemember patience  Exit  OLYMPIA  SCENE VII  MENTEVOLE  alone  And what more likely He is Claudio's brother  Noble as he and deck'd too with the plume  Of brave adventure in the Candian war  Younger and not less comely She may call it  As women make shrewd logick for their likings  Truth to the memory of her former vows  To embrace the living brother for the dead  And so find faith in her inconstancy  I know not why my genius shrinks at him  The very  fear  craves vengeance like a wrong  Beware gay stripling no degenerate awe  Of what  may  be can check my firy course  She must be mine and  shall  be For the means  Or good or ill necessity must shape them  THE END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  A Chamber in  Durazzo's  Palace  JULIA  alone at a Table putting up papers which she has been reading She presses them passionately to her heart kisses them and speaks  Dear sad remembrances my tears have stain'd you  O foolish drops wash not away my treasure  Unenvied unobserv'd and solitary  Let me indulge this luxury of grief  My Claudio's soul was pour'd out on these papers  And every little word recalls him to me  Lovely belov'd in beauty's manly bloom  Protesting welcome vows and breathing passion  SCENE II  To her  OLYMPIA  Return'd so speedily my gentle friend  Your cares are so preventive of my wishes  I shall begin to expect beyond all bounds  And grow presuming from too much indulgence  OLYMPIA  From Fulvia and her son I bring my Julia  A thousand kind endearments Both together  With cordial acceptation heard your message  And presently both mean to visit you  JULIA  Why does not pleasure kindle through my frame  And mount up to my cheek at such glad tidings  The time has been I should have glow'd at this  Counting the impatient moments till her coming  But my repining heart deserves no blessings  OLYMPIA  To labour to forget I know is vain  The fond endeavour toils against itself  And deeper graves the idea 'twould efface  Yet there are means  JULIA  Unprofitable all  How have I dragg'd about this weary load  Through every change of place and circumstance  I mingled with the young the gay the happy  Forcing a hollow smile at giddy joy  While my pale heart sat mocking it within  The arrow sticking here from scene to scene  You led my sad insensibility  The objects varying but my soul the same  OLYMPIA  Too much I fear we try'd and you endur'd  Our wellmeant unavailing services  JULIA  Could I forbear I would not weep Olympia  Indeed I would not for it pains my friends  'Twas such a black unapprehended horrour  So sudden and so dreadfully consummate  I sometimes for a moment close my eyes  And strive to think I've had a hideous dream  That quite awake 'twill vanish from my brain  That still he lives and I again shall see him  Ah no the short illusion is the dream  Claudio thy death the dire reality  OLYMPIA  The volume of his days too soon was clos'd  But grace and honour had so fill'd the record  Each page outweigh'd a long life's history  JULIA  This was the hour when my dear father came  Trembling and pale to falter out the tidings  That instant mighty ruler of our fates  Had thy exterminating arm reach'd here  These floods of bitter tears this black despair  Had not beep number'd with the sins of Julia  OLYMPIA  Tame languid minds whose course glides dully on  Yield as the stream to the sharp severing keel  To close as quickly on each transient wound  But woe's deep traces never leave thy breast  JULIA  Was I not mad Olympia I remember  I felt the stab in GenoaWhen I wak'd  The place nor aught around me were the fame  I saw the smooth Bisagnio as I lay  Rolling his quiet tide beneath my window  It seem'd Elysium and the peaceful shades  Where guiltless lovers are no more divided  OLYMPIA  But now my friend collect your fortitude  Nor start when you behold your Claudio's image  Recall'd to life and blooming in Marcellus  I know he'll soon be here  JULIA  Why should I dread it  Disus'd even to the shadow of a joy  My fickly apprehension plays the coward  Yet I will see him  OLYMPIA  You turn pale my Julia  Shall I forbid his coming  JULIA  No This weakness  Will pass away A treacherous hectick wastes me  I shall not suffer longIs he to like  So very like his brother  OLYMPIA  Features stature  Almost the same Somewhat a bolder air  Yet gentle still and youthful as he is  A little frown of discontented thought  Casts o'er his brow a momentary shade  That seems not native to his generous aspect  JULIA  In such an aspect was my paradise  But now pale lead lies on that mouldering face  Whose beams shot rapture once to Julia's bosom  OLYMPIA  By nature fram'd for every genial bliss  Turn gently turn from that cold retrospect  And there is one  JULIA  I know whom you would name  OLYMPIA  Then smile and name him for me  JULIA  No I cannot  I cannot smile and name Mentevole  But yet I much respect him  OLYMPIA  Bare respect  For passion such as his  JULIA  Olympia spare me  In this alone I must seem obstinate  OLYMPIA  Alas poor brother  aside  JULIA  Hark my father comes  Hold him a little moment in discourse  I would not have him see I had been weeping  JULIA  retires a little  SCENE III  To  JULIA  and  OLYMPIA DURAZZO  DURAZZO  I come Olympia to this chamber door  To learn my destiny As we inquire  From those who wake us if the sun looks bright  Or clouds obscure him and then suit our garments  To meet the changeful temper of the sky  So by the colour of my daughter's health  My mind is dress'd for gladness or dejection  OLYMPIA  I think she mends Her sorrow that was silent  Finds some relief in utterance She approaches  JULIA  Your blessing sir  DURAZZO  O may it drop upon thee  Refreshing as mild dews on vernal flowers  To kill the canker that consumes thy fragrance  JULIA  My heart my grateful heart owns all your goodness  And could my first devotion reach the sky  Time and your honour'd days should end together  DURAZZO  Not too long life pray not for curses on me  Helpless uncomely loath'd and burdensome  I would not cling to the last hold of nature  Nor lag without one social cord to aid me  Surviving my companions of the voyage  The world to me would seem a ruin'd vessel  A worthless wreck when mann'd alone by strangers  Let my heart burst at once with some great feeling  Let me go all together to my grave  Not maim'd and piecemeal with infirmity  I have liv'd enough could I but see thee happy  JULIA  That will not be  DURAZZO  I swear it must it shall be  And come I have a suit which you must grant me  JULIA  My dearest father  throwing her arms round him  DURAZZO  Change these mourning weeds  For outward signs though trifles in themselves  When the mind's weak and spirits delicate  To fancy in herself too powerful  Lend their mute aid and make her workings stronger  JULIA  This habit was best suited to my mood  But shall no more offend you  DURAZZO  Fair Olympia  I now must beg your aid Your constant brother  Nor does proud Genoa boast a nobler youth  With adoration such as saints pay heaven  Devotes his service here  JULIA  Ah sir for pity  I feel myself not worthy of his passion  My soul is out of tune to flattery  The fondest vows that ever lover sigh'd  Might wring my eyes but never warm my heart  DURAZZO  Nay stop these tears I'll urge this theme no more  And see an honour'd visitant approaches  Receive her not in sorrow  SCENE IV  To them  FULVIA MARCELLUS  behind  JULIA  and  FULVIA  embrace  FULVIA  Lovely Julia  In this embrace I hop'd to have clasp'd a daughter  To have call'd thee mine by an endearing tie  That yields alone to nature's closest bond  But though that fleet delusive dream is vanish'd  With pride I own thy native excellence  These eager throbbings while I hold thee thus  Are stronger protestations how I prize thee  Than all the lavish praise my tongue could utter  JULIA  Here let me grow for ever none divide us  Methinks when these protecting arms enfold me  Longvanish'd peace seems to return once more  And spread her dovelike wings again to shield me  MARCELLUS  They told me truth I never saw such beauty  aside looking at  JULIA  FULVIA  Vile slander on my life has wrong'd her virtue  aside  Have I not seem'd unkind so many months  A stranger here where evernew delight  Sprung in our paths where each returning morn  Among the happy found me happiest  But O I fear'd for thee and for myself  Our walks these chambers every senseless object  By known relation to our common loss  Had conjur'd up to our accustom'd sense  Sad visions of his looks his gestures words  And multiplied the ideas we should banish  JULIA  I judg'd it not unkindness for I know  Your generous nature feels for all who suffer  And if to have been once supremely bless'd  To have reach'd the height of every human wish  Then suddenbut your swelling eyes reproach me  You own'd him first before his birth you lov'd him  But O this selfish grief forgets all titles  FULVIA  Yet join with me to bless that providence  Which bending gracious to a parent's prayer  'Midst all the perils of destructive war  Preserv'd one pillar of my falling house  Come near my son and in this fair perfection  Behold what next to thee the world contains  Most precious to thy mother  MARCELLUS  who has been behind with  DURAZZO  advances  JULIA  Saints and angels  starting  Am I awake or is this mockery  O I could gaze for ever on that face  Nor wish to rouse me from the dear delusion  Still let me know him only by my eyes  O do not speak lest some unusual sound  An alien to my ear dissolve this vision  And tell me thou but wear'st my Claudio's outside  MARCELLUS  If it commend me Madam to your favour  I would not change it for the comliest form  That ever charm'd the eye with fair proportion  But stop not at the exterior search me deeply  For proof command me instant to your service  Though peril walk with death in the achievement  Swifter than falcons through the trackless air  My eager thoughts shall fly to your obedience  JULIA  Take heed take heed tempt not the dangerous shore  Rocks shelves and quicksands lurk I fear around me  And let one gallant vessel's shipwreck warn thee  Shun the same course and find a happier fortune  MARCELLUS  I fear no shelves no quicksands but thy frown  Aw'd and enraptur'd I behold such beauty  And while I talk thus wish to find some language  Fit for a being of a sphere above me  A  Servant  enters and whispers  OLYMPIA  OLYMPIA  Julia a word Mentevole attends  to  JULIA  aside  And asks to be admitted  JULIA  Now Not now  Indeed I cannot see him Quick my Olympia  Prevent his entrance My poor fluttering heart  If suddenly that name is founded to me  Beats like a prison'd bird against its cage  When some annoying hand is stretch'd to seize it  DURAZZO  Madam this day which brings you back to us  to  FULVIA  We should make festival Your presence here  Has wrought a miracle I have not seen  A smile of joy enlighten that dear face  Heaven knows how long till you brought sunshine with you  FULVIA  I have upbraidings for my absence  here  The cause I'm sure a false one In atonement  Let me observe her with a mother's care  Invention shall be rack'd to find new means  To lure her thoughts to sweet serenity  She shall not see the frequent tears that wear  Their woeful channel down a parent's cheeks  And to the brightest source of mortal comfort  I will commend her when I kneel to heaven  DURAZZO  May plumes of seraphs waft your pious prayers  The tenderness of women has a charm  Our rougher natures can attain but rudely  Your voices are such dulcet instruments  They steal the listening soul from its affliction  To wind it gently in the soft enchantment  FULVIA  O may that power be mine Observe my Julia  My lord commits you to my guardianship  Do you confirm the trust  JULIA  An outcast's fortune  A light pitiless fall on me could I fail  To bend with reverence for your dear protection  FULVIA  Come let us hence the air is mild abroad  Julia we must not sink but strive to banish  That restless inbred foe to the afflicted  Reflection from our bosoms  JULIA  Would I could  But death's long sleep alone can banish him  Exeunt all but  MARCELUS  MARCELLUS  My soul and all its faculties go with her  looking after  JULIA  Grace beauty sweetness all that captivates  And holds us long in dear delicious bonds  Indissoluble bonds for time too strong  For change or casualty are summ'd up there  Divinity of love absolute master  From this white hour to thy allpotent sway  Thus I submit me hence all idle thoughts  I chase you forth Fullplum'd ambition glory  Arms and the war farewel Her brighter image  Claims all my bosom and disdains a rival  Exit  SCENE VI  A Place before  Durazzo's  Palace  MENTEVOLE  with a letter and a  Servant  Convey this letter to the lady Fulvia  Be muffled close and cloak'd that none may know you  Speak not a word but leave it and return  Exit  Servant  Pride and suspicion in her violent temper  From this short scroll will work rare mischief for me  One spark will set her passions in a blaze  A hint to her is proof demonstrative  SoI must bear this too she will not see me  Her health is delicate But young Marcellus  He fits a lady's chamber at all seasons  Soft as Favoniusand a cherub's cheek  Is not so smooth and rosy Precious minion  They think me sure a tame enduring slave  A trampled clod they shall not find me such  The scanty drop which once was patience here  Flames as it flows and kindles all my nature  To its own element of tire within me  Ha he appears Choke me not indignation  Prey inwards down while I dissemble calmness  MENTEVOLE  retires a little  SCENE VII  MARCELLUS  enters looking back  Ay there's the attraction Thou unconscious house  Thy turrets should be cased with beaten gold  For thou enshrin'st a goddessCan it be  Not three years pass'd regardless of her charms  Day after day I saw her and forgot them  Or does the beauty of the fullblown rose  Surpass the promise of the opening bud  I sure lov'd Claudio well no brother's bond  Was truer to a brother yet self self  This sudden flower now springs up from his grave  That in a brother lies a rival buried  MENTEVOLE  advances  My lord well met You then have seen this wonder  Has fame exceeded think you  MARCELLUS  How exceeded  MENTEVOLE  Spoke Julia fairer than your eyes confess her  MARCELLUS  All eyes all hearts with rapture must confess her  MENTEVOLE  Then I must think you do not mean to pine  In silent adoration  MARCELLUS  What bless'd strain  Can touch that gentle bosom  MENTEVOLE  Take my counsel  Devote thy soul to any thing but love  Steep thy drench'd senses in the mad'ning bowl  Heap gold and hug the mammon for itself  Set provinces on dice o'er the pale lamp  Of sickly science waste thy vigorous youth  Rush to the war or cheer the deeptongu'd hound  Be thou the proverb'd slave of each or all  They shall not be so noxious to thy soul  As dainty woman's love  MARCELLUS  If this be counsel  It comes with such a harsh and boisterous breath  I more discern the freedom than the friendship  MENTEVOLE  Falsly our poets deck the barbarous god  With roseat hue with infants' dimpling smiles  With wanton curls and wings of downy gold  He dips his darts in poisonous aconite  The firy venom rankles in our veins  Infuses rage and murderous cruelty  MARCELLUS  The richest juice pour'd in a tainted jar  Turns to a nauseous and unwholesome draught  But we condemn the vessel not the wine  So gentle love lodg'd in a savage breast  May change his nature to a tyger's fierceness  MENTEVOLE  Away with vain disguise Mark me my lord  I long have lov'd this lady with a passion  Too quick and jealous not to find a rival  Too fierce to brook him She receives my vows  Her father favours them Wealth titles honour  My rank in the state and many fair additions  Surpass'd by none keep buoyant my full hopes  If yet your heart's untouch'd I ask entreat it  And strangers grant such common courtesies  Forbear your visits to her  MARCELLUS  Believe this  Were there a fasting lion in my path  I'd rather this good steel here by my side  Should grow one piece with the sheath or in my grasp  Shrink to a bulrush but to mock the wielder  Than feed you with the smallest hope or promise  I mean not to fulfil  MENTEVOLE  Then we are  oes  MARCELLUS  I'm sorry for't  MENTEVOLE  Deadly irreconcilable  Two eager racers starting for one goal  Both cannot win but shame must find the loser  You step between me and the light of heaven  You strive to rob me of my life's best hope  For life without her were my curse my burden  With cruel calmness you pluck out my heart  Therefore were the world's bounds more wide and large  They could not hold us both  MARCELLUS  I little thought  To draw my sword against my brother's friend  And here attest heaven and my peaceful soul  You drag this quarrel on me  MENTEVOLE  Yonder herd  Who prying now would interrupt our purpose  Will two hours hence be hous'd to avoid the sun  Then riding at his height at home I'll wait you  And lead you thence to a sequester'd spot  Fit for the mortal issue of our meeting  MARCELLUS  Since you will have it so  MENTEVOLE  The die is cast  Have I the bulk and sinewy strength of man  But to sustain a heavier injury  Let cowards shiver with a smother'd hate  And fear the evil valour might avert  The brave man's sword secures his destiny  Exeunt severally  THE END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE I  A Garden behind  Mentevole's  house  MENTEVOLE  alone on a garden seat looking at a picture  And must I be content with thee poor shadow  Yet she's less kind than this her counterfeit  For this looks pleas'd and seems to smile upon me  O what a form is here her polish'd front  Blue slender veins winding their silken maze  Through flesh of living snow Young Hebe's hue  Blushing ambrosial health Her plenteous tresses  Luxuriant beauty Those bewitching eyes  That shot their soft contagion to my soul  But where's their varied sweetness Where the fire  To drive men wild with passion to their ruin  Where are her gentle words the dewy breath  Balming the newblown roses 'tis exhaled through  Thou envious happy lawn hide those white orbs  That swell beneath thy folds O power of beauty  If thou canst sanctifyBy heaven my sister  rise  Up fair perdition  attempting hastily to put up the picture he drops it on the ground  SCENE II  To him  OLYMPIA  'Twas not well Olympia  To break thus on my privacy My orders  Were strictly given that none should now have entrance  OLYMPIA  I would not be deny'd and when you know  Why I am here you will have cause to bless  Not chide me for the intrusion  MENTEVOLE  Then be quick  For other cares and of more serious import  Will presently demand me Speak your purpose  OLYMPIA  My lips would give my purpose little grace  When she who sent me forward but to find you  Can speak it for herself I came with Julia  MENTEVOLE  With Julia Do not mock me  OLYMPIA  Turn your eyes  To yonder cypress see who there expects you  MENTEVOLE  By all my hopes of happiness 'tis she  Like a descended angel there she stands  OLYMPIA  Herself indeed then haste conduct her hither  MENTEVOLE  rushes out  SCENE III  OLYMPIA  sees and take up the picture  Ay as I thought her picture On this face  His eyes were fed when my approach surpris'd him  Thou fair consumer of his pining soul  O thou delicious poison for a while  Though he may grieve let me withhold thee from him  With what a blaze of wealth has he adorn'd it  What gems are here I'll leave it in her sight  This silent proof should more commend his suit  Than hotbreath'd vows whose common vehemence  Their common violation quickly follows  SCENE IV  To  OLYMPIA MENTEVOLE  leading in  JULIA  JULIA  Well may you be surpris'd nor can you question  When you behold me here how deep the interest  That urges me to seek you  MENTEVOLE  To behold you  Whate'er the cause is such excess of bliss  How how shall I pour out my enraptur'd sense  How thank this condescension  JULIA  Good my lord  The anxious bosom ill at ease like mine  Partakes no raptures Calmness and attention  If I deserve your thanks will better thank me  MENTEVOLE  Thou soul of all my passions this fond breast  Is but the obedient instrument whose chords  As you think meet sound high or sink to silence  JULIA  I have heard of your late outrage to Marcellus  MENTEVOLE  Has he complain'd and to a lady's ear  JULIA  Wrong not his welltried courage No the attendants  Saw all your furious gestures heard your challenge  And for prevention to Olympia ran  To alarm us of the danger  OLYMPIA  He's conceal'd  And has been since your parting That confirms it  JULIA  Waste not the precious minutes in denial  MENTEVOLE  Fool that I was no kind concern for me  The safety of Marcellus made you seek me  JULIA  And I avow the motive Am I held  Like those grim idols barbarous nations worship  By cruel rites to be propitiated  If love prevail not dress'd in smiles and softness  Array'd in blood will the fell monster charm me  No if you prize my peace it you desire  I ever more should name Mentevole  Or suffer him in thought but with abhorrence  Dismiss your causeless hate to Claudio's brother  MENTEVOLE  Let him dismiss his love to Claudio's mistress  JULIA  Your own imaginary light suggestion  He boasts it glories in it Causeless hate  Causeless to hate the envenom'd thing that stings me  Diseases curdle up his youthful blood  And mar his specious outside  JULIA  Watchful angels  Keep him in charge and o'er his gallant head  Spread their protecting wings to avert thy curses  MENTEVOLE  Ha am I then  OLYMPIA  Is this your promis'd patience  MENTEVOLE  What can I do  JULIA  What reason bids you do  Not to repent but to commit a wrong  Gives shame's true crimson to the ingenuous cheek  Ask his indulgence and confess your frenzy  MENTEVOLE  The boy may think I fear him  JULIA  No not so  What generous spirit is not slow to ascribe  Motives to others which itself would scorn  Are you alone too mighty to have err'd  Rather suspect your pride revolts to own it  Acknowledge it and then have cause for pride  And rise exalted by humility  Contrition is fair virtue's meekey'd sister  Her drops can wash offence to fleecy white  Turning our sins to gracious intercessors  The wisest sometimes may do wrong from passion  But conscious of that wrong the ruffian only  By brutal perseverance twice does wrong  Mean pride false principle true honour scorns them  MENTEVOLE  It goes against my nature's bent  JULIA  Indeed  Then hear me hear this solemn protestation  If you persist by that benevolent power  Whose blessed beams avert from violence  Whose law forbids it  MENTEVOLE  O enough forbear  Yes you shall be obey'd I will put on  The meek demeanour of repenting rashness  And to the foe I hate thus bending cry  Forgive me  since you will it Yet remember  I thus degrade me in mine own esteem  Only to rise in yours Your liberal nature  Will give my free compliance its best gloss  It shews your full dominion o'er my soul  That joyfully prefers your least command  Even to my honour which I risk to obey you  JULIA  The act bespeaks itself I must remember  My peace or misery was in your power  You chose the gentler part and made me happy  MENTEVOLE  Transporting thought behold I fly to meet him  The hour is come Marcellus now expects me  Farewel my eyes at variance with my tongue  Still gaze and cannot bear to lose thy beauties  Exit  MENTEVOLE  SCENE V  JULIA OLYMPIA  OLYMPIA  Indeed he loves you  JULIA  'Would to heaven he did not  It looks methinks like hard ingratitude  To render aught for love but equal love  Esteem the best affection I can offer  Seems but a dull unvalued counterpoise  And pays the glowing ore with worthless lead  Though all be little to give all is bounty  Exeunt  SCENE VI  Enter at an opposite side  MARCELLUS  and  MENTEVOLE  MARCELLUS  Enough my lord This fair acknowledgment  Has rais'd your justice high in my esteem  A soldier's honour can require no more  And sure tis better thus to join our hands  Than try their strength in rude hostility  MENTEVOLE  I was your brother's friend and while he liv'd  Though the same passion that still fires my soul  Then fiercely burn'd for this enchanting Julia  Yet from respect for his precedent claim  And to her choice avow'd within my breast  I kept the painful secret He so lov'd me  The wound he could not heal I would not shew  Then sure full equally from you Marcellus  New to her charms at least I may expect  A like declining  MARCELLUS  Good Mentevole  Let's find some safer subject  MENTEVOLE  No this only  I cannot speak or think of aught but her  She is my essence feeds wakes sleeps with me  Is vital to me as the air I breathe  But mark I am compos'd no violence  Lives in my thoughts or shall disgrace my tongue  MARCELLUS  Then lest I move your temper let me leave you  MENTEVOLE  No pr'ythee no not thus unsatisfied  I'll not contend but her transcendent beauty  Even at first sight must strike the gazer's eye  With admiration which might  grow  to love  But is it possible  one  interview  For you but once have seen her should so root  Her image in your soul that all your bliss  Or future misery depends on her  MARCELLES  Regard not me but reason for yourself  If all your faithful vows your length of courtship  Her father's favour and the nameless aids  Which time and opportunity have furnish'd  Raise not your hopes above a rival's power  Say were it not more wise and manly too  To rouse and shake off such a hard dominion  MENTEVOLE  How cold you talk Good heaven I might as well  Resolve to change my nature bid my ear  See for my eye or turn my blood to milk  Newstamp my features and newmould my limbs  Make this soft flesh that yields to every print  Impassive as thin air waste time and thought  On any wild impossibility  As be the thing I am and cease to love her  MARCELLUS  Then take my lord your course while I shall follow  The counsel which I offer Once rejected  No more to persecute where most I love  I shall retire and mourn repulse in silence  MENTEVOLE  So then my lord my suit is persecution  MARCELLUS  I said it not but since you will search further  I've heard almost as much  MENTEVOLE  And who inform'd you  MARCELLUS  A lower tone perhaps may meet an answer  MENTEVOLE  I  will  be answered  MARCELLUS  Willhot man farewell  going  MENTEVOLE  Come back I'll answer for you Your own pride  MARCELLUS  Ha have a care  MENTEVOLE  Your boyish vanity  Your fond conceit of that imposing form  MARCELLUS  I'll bear no more this insolence and rudeness  Have rous'd my rage and thus I answer thee  They fight  MENTEVOLE  is disarmed  MENTEVOLE  My life is yours Strike home  shewing his breast  MARCELLUS  Take back your sword  And when your peevish spleen next swells within you  Let this deserv'd rebuke subdue your choler  Exit  MARCELLUS  SCENE VII  MENTEVOLE  alone  He triumphs every way Vile baffled wretch  Where shall I hide my ignominious head  While love remorse and rage at once o'erwhelm me  Exit  MENTEVOLE  SCENE VIII  A Chamber in  Durazzo's  Palace with a toilet c  OLYMPIA  with a picture in her hand  NERINA  attending  â–ª  OLYMPIA  The danger's pass'd and Julia smiles again  My brother thy divining was too true  Her fears were not for thee But now to try  This new this last expedientGood Nerina  Observe this picture This day in his garden  Mentevole my enamour'd brother dropp'd it  It is the lovely likeness of thy lady  I leave it here Should it escape her view  Find you some means to bring it to her notice  If prodigality proclaim a passion  The diadems of kings are here outluster'd  And yet I fearThe mother of Marcellus  Her eye looks cold upon me I'll not meet her  OLYMPIA  hangs the picture on the frame of  JULIA's  dressingglass and exit  NERINA  retires  SCENE IX  FULVIA  with a paper  What can this mean They draw me here to insult me  I ask for this disconsolate this mourner  And find her where Why with a second lover  With young Mentevole Her panting bosom  Cannot  expect  his visit bur explores  His chambers secretly O my poor son  And could not all thy graces all thy virtues  One twelvemonth keep a mistress faithful to thee  The Indian pile that with the bridegroom dead  In the same blaze consumes his lifewarm bride  Is wild romance to our Italian ladies  Who cheers our inconsolable in private  Why the kind sister of Mentevole  Then rumour which I slander'd told me truth  And  this  tells truth Let me once more peruse it  reads  If you respect the safety of Marcellus  Prevent his visits to Durazzo's daughter  A favour'd lover has her plighted faith  Who will not brook a rival Trust this warning  And see the fair dissimulation comes  Again to sigh to flatterand deceive me  SCENE X  To her  JULIA  JULIA  Madam forgive my anxiety that paper  I hope it brought you no distressful tidings  When your eye ran it o'er your colour chang'd  And a sad presage instant seiz'd my heart  Fearful perhaps from weakness more than reason  FULVIA  I thank you no the import is not new  It tells me what the world has long believ'd  That women can dissemble and are sickle  JULIA  But why choose you for the rude confidence  FULVIA  I fear there was a reason  JULIA  Pardon me  Perhaps I've been intrusive for that brow  Seems to reprove me for a wish to know  What you think fit to hide  FULVIA  My interests madam  Must henceforth be confin'd to my own breast  I have no sunshine there and would not cloud  The cheerful prospect of your coming joys  With illtim'd sorrow  JULIA  Have I Joys to come  To mix my grief with yours dejected lost  To keep one object in my wounded mind  To hold discourse with his ideal form  To make my present state my future hope  Fears wishes prayers all studies of my life  But slaves to one afflicting memory  These are  my  joys and who shall envy them  FULVIA  Hateful hypocrisy O ten times devil  aside  When to beguile at wears an angel's outside  Turning from  JULIA  she sees the picture on the table  Ha can I trust my sight What's this before me  JULIA  What's this indeed  FULVIA  It curdles up my blood  The very same I know these precious gems  Bought with such cost the east was ransack'd for them  How came it here  JULIA  By all my tears and sorrows  My murder'd Claudio on the day we lost him  Wore this around his neck  FULVIA  He did he did  JULIA  He shew'd it to me next his heart it hung  That fatal morning By what means unknown  What wond'rous magick I again behold it  Confounds me with amazement  NERINA  advancing  Madam hear me  In part I can explain the mystery  Olympia but a little ere you enter'd  Thus plac'd it on the table bade me mark it  And should it chance to escape my lady's eye  Present it to her notice In his garden  This morn she added Lord Mentevole  Her brother dropp'd it But I know no further  FULVIA  Dropp'd by Mentevole his sister said so  NERINA  Madam she did  FULVIA  to  JULIA  Ha did you hear that tale  JULIA  Eternal providence 'twill then be found  The hellish deed be traced to its dark source  O truedivining instinct now I know  Why at his sight oppress'd with chilling horrour  Cold tremÃ¶rs crept through all my shivering frame  Why faithful nature shrinking felt the alarm  As if some fatal deadly thing approach'd me  Haste madam haste that clue shall be our guide  Yes I shall live to see the black detection  The secret villain's shame blood shed for blood  While Claudio's sainted spirit from above  Smiles to applaud and urge the righteous justice  FULVIA  Can I bear this Such zeal is worthy of you  It quite transports you But first answer me  How did Mentevole possess this picture  JULIA  O 'would I knewBut let us fly this moment  FULVIA  Did you not  secretly  this morning see him  Answer me quick  JULIA  I did Of that hereafter  FULVIA  Hold When a lover has a lady's picture  A favour'd lover too though she should swear  Swear deeply till the host of heaven blush for her  She's ignorant how he had it O to trust her  Asks such a reach of blind credulity  As turns belief to folly  JULIA  Your fierce looks  This sudden anger are so strange to me  I stand like one just startled from a dream  And cannot dare not think I wake and hear you  FULVIA  Then let me rouse you from your lethargy  The flimsy tissue of your artifice  Is all unravell'd By no doubtful proofs  I am confirm'dyour fondness for my son  Your tender care of me your tears distractions  Your mourning weeds which now I see are chang'd  Ay and your highwrought rhapsody this moment  Were all a publick ostentatious sorrow  Nought but an acted passion a stage transport  And I the fool who pitied you your scorn  Do you now wake Now do you understand me  JULIA  Too well too well The peal of dreadful thunder  Will sound till death in my astonish'd ears  O stab me to the heart dash me to earth  And trample my poor body in the dust  Try every labour'd cunning cruelty  That rage revenge or malice e'er devised  Or was sustain'd by woman's constancy  I'll bear it allI would not shed one tear  Would bless you think it mercy to the pangs  Which wring my soul from every word you have utter'd  FULVIA  And may the fiend who visits guilt like thine  If my reproaches fail or the world's justice  Supply a sharper scourge and more afflict thee  JULIA  I thought the rigour of my fate accomplish'd  By Claudio's death secure in one great woe  Look'd forward with a smile to all the ills  Adversity's worst wrath could pour upon me  But you inhuman you have found the way  To wake such new such unimagin'd horrours  If there be any power whose melting eye  Sheds soft compassion on us may that power  Hear and receive my fervent supplication  Let me be mad and lose this sense of anguish  FULVIA  What can'st thou hope from me but rage and vengeance  JULIA  No nothing else I have deserv'd them from thee  FULVIA  I'll to the duke the senate shall assemble  When this dumb evidence appears before them  With all that chance has now reveal'd against thee  Think when thou art summon'd to their dread tribunal  Will that fair face of innocence and wonder  This wringing of thy hands a few false tears  Shake their stern justice  JULIA  O heaven pardon you  FULVIA  If you have prayers reserve them for yourself  Your state perhaps may need them  JULIA  kneeling  Turn and hear me  FULVIA  Kneel not to me  JULIA  I kneel not for myself  To thee I am as spotless from offence  As the soft sleep of cradled infancy  But when your cruelty has broke my heart  And sunk me unresenting to my grave  If your mistaken rage gives way to reason  As sure it will in that calm searching hour  When you shall find how sorely you have wrong'd me  Wrong'd her who lov'd you with a child's affection  Then censure not your rashness too severely  Then try to reconcile your soul to peace  And O forgive yourself as I forgive you  SCENE XI  To them  DURAZZO  DURAZZO  How's this my daughter kneeling and in tears  And anger glowing on the cheek of Fulvia  Rise Julia riseMadam that stern regard  JULIA  O sir you must not pity nor approach me  I dare not trust to nature or affection  Your breast perhaps may turn to marble too  Source of my life dear even as thee my father  Your Julia lov'd herSee these bitter tears  With agonies like these am I requited  DURAZZO  A fury's brand must sure have sear'd the breast  That could give thee a pang my joy my comfort  What have you done  to  FULVIA  FULVIA  Do you behold this picture  Claudio my son the day the assassin stabb'd him  Wore this detested bawble next his heart  Mentevole that weeping lady's lover  This morning dropp'd it Ask you how he had it  Let that light woman and her minion answer  DURAZZO  And is that scornful finger for my daughter  Injurious as thou art  JULIA  For pity hold  I have enough of misery already  Revil'd upbraided charg'd with monstrous guilt  She knew not what she saidindeed I hope so  But let me here fall lifeless at her feet  My heaving heart burst with its throbs before her  Rather than hear your tongue cast back reproach  To violate the reverence I still owe her  DURAZZO  Hear'st thou inhuman  FULVIA  Yes with scorn I hear her  That syren's voice has lost the power to charm  Why stay I here to breathe the infectious air  May curses rest on these devoted walls  Till livid lightning to the centre shake them  Exit  FULVIA  SCENE XII  DURAZZO  and  JULIA  DURAZZO  Heaven be our guard What means she by that picture  Mentevole and thee  JULIA  I cannot speak it  Pray lead me hence  DURAZZO  Scarce have I power to aid thee  JULIA  O for a friendly draught of long oblivion  To freeze up every feeling faculty  Against calamity I strive in vain  Since thus each distant gleam of flattering hope  Mocks with false light or bursts in storms upon me  Exeunt  THE END OF THE THIRD ACT  ACT IV  SCENE I A Chamber in  Durazzo's  Palace  DURAZZO MARCELLUS  and  CAMILLO  DURAZZO  Not so not so deem me not lost to reason  My breast is ever open to receive you  Though Fulvia's son I hold you not allied  To Fulvia's enmity and violence  Nay were we foes which I should grieve to think  The qualities and virtue of Marcellus  Could find no tongue more prompt in their report  Than old Durazzo's  MARCELLUS  My much honour'd lord  These friendly sounds are cordials to my ear  Soon as I heard my mother's frantick tale  Though tears and exclamations scarce gave room  For her distemper'd rage to tell the story  Such consternation seiz'd me as if earth  Convuls'd had yawn'd at once beneath my feet  And livid flames shot upwards to consume me  DURAZZO  Did I not scorn to mate a woman's malice  What vengeful spunge though steep'd in Stygian gall  Could wipe away my deepdy'd injuries  My house's ancient honour set at nonght  The little spark of health which just rekindling  Glow'd in the check of my dear innocent child  And warm'd her father's hopes rudely extinguish'd  Her name that like a holy word was utter'd  Grace and good will still ushering the sound  Cast for vile question to the publick streets  'Midst scurril casuists and the lees of Genoa  By my just rage the sanctity of virtue  Never sustain'd so gross a profanation  MARCELLUS  With burning blushes as the shame were mine  And hooting crowds made me derision's scoff  I own the justice of a father's anger  Descend mild patience to her harrow'd breast  What fortitude can arm her feeling heart  Against the rankling barb of this fell arrow  'Gainst galling taunts 'gains mortal accusations  From lips whose every sound should sooth and bless her  DURAZZO  The malice of a foe may be endur'd  But friendship's stabthe very plank we cling to  Turn'd to a barbarous engine for destruction  And yet her gentle her forgiving nature  Unwillingly permits my just reproach  She checks my indignation by rememb'ring  How kind how tender Fulvia once was to her  And how the exalted virtues of her soul  Transcend her frailties and efface this error  SCENE II  Enter an  Officer  OFFICER  Be on your guard my lord we have certain notice  The rabble stir'd up by some strange report  Mustering from every quarter are assembled  And threaten insult here  DURAZZO  I thank you sir  Let them come on we are prepar'd to meet them  The love of tumult and not zeal for justice  Is their great principle What think you now  Exit  Officer  MARCELLUS  The wretch arraign'd whose gasping expectation  Hangs on the aweful pause that dooms or saves him  Feels peace and bliss to what my breast endures  Till prostrate at her feet I clear my honour  My reason and each spark of manhood in me  From vile concurrence in this monstrous outrage  This instant lead me to her  CAMILLO  Hold Marcellus  We must not give too loose a rein to passion  At such a trembling crisis Good my lord  to  DURAZZO  To check the shameful licence and disorder  Which hourly spread more wide by our inaction  One way at least is plain  DURAZZO  My mind's distracted  I should before have told you our resolves  But my vex'd spirit this way finds relief  And vents itself in railing But 'tis thus  The duke and much I'm bound to thank his grace  Though urg'd to every harsh extremity  By that fierce woman kindly has determin'd  To take the milder course Himself in person  When I appoint the hour will visit us  He knows already every circumstance  In its true state nor heeds our foe's perversion  And resting so with honour I must own  Suspicion has its mark  CAMILLO  Mentevole  DURAZZO  My favour to that lord his daily boast  The prattle of this busy babbling city  Pregnant and positive in slanderous falshoods  The picture dropp'd by him and found with Julia  But most her secret meeting him this morning  Which till explain'd gives colour to suggestion  Have so perversely wound us in the snare  We stand like him expos'd the common butt  For every shaft of venom'd calumny  MASCELLUS  Heavens can it be That angel she expos'd  To bear the prying eye the insidious question  Of proud unfeeling quaint authority  Each sauntering varlet worthless of the honour  To strew her paths with rushes unabash'd  Gaze on the emotions of her lovely face  And find a heighten'd zest in her confusion  I will not trust myself to wear my sword  Lest with a firy instinct from my side  It start at once and in their blood avenge her  CAMILLO  Reason and justice are her best avengers  Be calm then good Marcellus hear the means  Just now an order issued from the state  That none should pass the city's suburb gates  Nor vessel leave the port till the duke's licence  Permits the usual egress This though pointed  But at Mentevole being general  Wounds not his pride nor can awake suspicion  DURAZZO  I fear the wise precaution was in vain  Suspicion will awake when conscience sleeps not  And hisbut I am to blameappearances  Are indexes full oft which point to error  CAMILLO  His sister as we learn has sought a convent  And will no more be found  DURAZZO  I pity her  Poor wretch unconsciously the instrument  To speed perhaps a brother's infamy  But all she knew already is divulg'd  Keep eye Camillo on Mentevole  For you dear youth be sure no mean mistrust  Unworthy my esteem and your high honour  Can ever harbour here  MARCELLUS  Yet O Durazzo  I feel but half assur'd An ugly shame  Chilling the native freedom of my spirit  Hangs on me loads me drags me to the ground  Nor can I shake the vile dejection off  Till sweeter than the gale from newborn flowers  Her balmy lips breathe peace into my bosom  Will you not lead me to her  DURAZZO  Yes Marcellus  Deplore with me the ruins of a mind  Where nature lavish'd every grace and virtue  To make misfortune still more eminent  Come then let's onWithout there  Enter  Sarv  Is my daughter  Still in her chamber  SERVANT  She but now was seen  Without attendants near the orange grove  DURAZZO  Ere we return here should the duke arrive  You'll find us near the grove Now I attend you  to  MAR  SERVANT  My lord the stranger we this morn admitted  Waits in the outward chamberIf your leisure  DURAZZO  I had forgot Good man yes bid him enter  Exit  Serv  Marcellus for a moment pardon me  Exeunt  MARCELLUS  and  CAMILLO  SCENE III  DURAZZO  alone  He has known better days and to my thought  No cares however near us can excuse  Our hard neglect of humble misery  SCENE IV  To  DURAZZO MANOA  enters with humility  MANOA  I am too bold  DURAZZO  No worthy Manoa  Pride may intrude but not the unfortunate  But how Thy cheeks are pale thy started eye  Looks fearfully around What sudden terrour  Shakes thus thy manhood  MANOA  O my gracious lord  In vain I hoped your pity and protection  Might be stretch'd forth to screen me from my foes  The cruel vigilance of fate has found me  I am discover'd lost  DURAZZO  I trust not so  MANOA  A dreadful order is but now gone forth  To close the port up and the city gates  It must be meant 'gainst me to hem me in  And yield my life to cruel men who hate me  DURAZZO  Dismiss that fear I know the cause too well  'Tis distant far from thee  MANOA  Indeed  DURAZZO  Most sure  MANOA  I breathe again May every blessing crown you  DURAZZO  I know your innocence and will not fail  To impress the duke and senate in your favour  Nor can I think but for some special end  A providence so visible preserv'd you  Mean time take comfort to you and rest here  Secure these walls shall be your sanctuary  MANOA  O everbounteous to the oppress'd and wretched  The strength of our forefathers be your shield  And for this manna to my famish'd hopes  When full of age and honours you lie down  Protect your generations to time's end  Exit  MANOA  DURAZZO  Who waits  Enter  Serv  Observe that stranger with respect  And see that none molest him  Exit  Serv  O Mentevole  It must be so A thousand distant hints  Like meteor glancing through a dusky sky  That nothing shew distinctly cross my brain  But soon the dim horizon will be clear  And truth's bright ray dispel the doubtful twilight  Exit  DURAZZO  SCENE V  The Garden of  DURAZZO's  Palace  MENTEVOLE  alone A Whistle is heard  Hark that's my signal Then she's near the grove  And see a woman's form Be firm my heart  No fluttering now Let dire necessity  That in itself contains all arguments  Fix its strong fiat on my resolution  And cancel nature's fear She must be mine  I have buffetted beyond the midway flood  Nor shall my sinews shrink so near the shore  But come the worst 'gainst shame and disappointment  Thou sharp but friendly leech I will apply thee  He draws a dagger which he holds up and returns again to his bosom  Soft soft from hence unseen I may observe her  he retires  Enter  JULIA  No I must still endure for death is proud  Owes none obedience nor will come when summon'd  The happy who avoid him he pursues  And with malignant triumph loves to enter  Where dreams of long security and joy  Give tenfold terrours to the grim intruder  To thee I stretch my arms thee I invoke  For in thy cold and leaden grasp thereHa  seeing  MENTEVOLE  she starts  MENTEVOLE  Why start you madam Have a few short hours  So chang'd the man you sought nay kinder still  With gentle intercession sooth'd and won  To mercy for a rival that a serpent  Rising on mortal spires to sting your life  Could not excite more horrour than his presence  JULIA  Thou art indeed a serpent coil'd for mischief  To dart out on the unwary drink his blood  And slink again to thy dark lurking place  Why art thou here  MENTEVOLE  To talk to thee of love  JULIA  Of murder ratherHence  going  MENTEVOLE  I must detain you  holding her  A moment is not long And can thy wisdom  For such a feather for one light surmise  That picture rashly deem me capable  Of shedding human blood nay a friend's blood  JULIA  Of every crime I deem thee capable  Thy furious temper knows no sacred bond  Death on thyself even kneeling at my feet  Thou hast vow'd with frantick oaths O patient heaven  Why did not fire from yon insulted sky  Consume him quick ere his pernicious rage  Had plung'd me in this gulph of wretchedness  MENTEVOLE  I am so clear from any conscious taint  On that foul charge I would not waste a moment  To purge me of so gross a villainy  What state what sex what excellence of mind  E'er found an armour against calumny  Give the most monstrous slander but a birth  Folly shall own and malice cherish it  It moves but my contempt Consider this  Art not thou too accus'd thy spotless self  Alike call'd criminal by what by madness  JULIA  I thank thee yes Thy most unwelcome love  Like some contagious vapour breath'd upon me  Has made me loathsome to the publick view  The persecution of thy hateful vows  That first disturb'd my peace now blasts my honour  I stand a poor defam'd suspected creature  The eyes whose gentle pity balm'd my sorrows  Now turn their beams with indignation on me  And thou the cause of all  MENTEVOLE  You hate me then  JULIA  Hate thee the term's too weak 'Tis vital horrour  The helpless dove views not the ravening kite  With such instinctive dread and detestation  The principle by which we start from death  Crave needful foodnature's original print  To shun our evil and pursue our good  By reason strengthen'd with increasing age  Are not so mix'd and general through my frame  Hence from my eyes Thy sight is deadly to me  MENTEVOLE  O thou unthankful beauty think a little  How envy'd but for thee had been my lot  My youth had glided down life's easy stream  With every sail outspread for every pleasure  But since the hour I saw thy fatal charms  My bosom has been hell How I have lov'd  All my neglected duties of the world  Friends parents interest country all forgotten  Cry out against me now I count the exchange  And find all barter'd for thy hate and scorn  JULIA  Dar'st thou upbraid me or assume a pride  Even from the homely meanness of thy soul  Thy long ungenerous importunity  Mere sensual love contented with the outside  The pure exalted incorporeal flame  Fann'd not by sympathy's soft breath expires  I never gave thee hope no not a look  Thy vanity could construe into kindness  I play'd no hypocrite my heart at once  Diffus'd its honest dictates to my eyes  They told thee my aversion my disdain  And were this air the last I should respire  Here in the face of heaven my tongue confirms them  MENTEVOLE  O eloquence of hatred noble candour  I am thy fool no more my doubts are vanish'd  Thou hast not left in all my swelling veins  One cold compunctious drop to chill my purpose  The lover scorn'd the man now rouses here  Mark me ungrateful  JULIA  Ha what means the traitor  aside  MENTEVOLE  This garden leads to mine the passages  Are all secur'd A ready priest within  Waits to unite us therefore yield at once  Vain is resistance If I raise my voice  Four faithful slaves behind yon thicket lodg'd  Will bear thee off  JULIA  Am I betray'd thus vilely  MENTEVOLE  Look round no aid is near thee Thou art mine  All thy reluctant beauties are my spoil  And won by wit shall be enjoy'd at will  Comenay no strife  JULIA  kneeling  O give me instant death  See at your feet I fall  MENTEVOLE  For worlds on worlds  I would not hurt thy charms My eyes my soul  Are not so dear to me  JULIA  Satiate thy rage  With newinvented cruelty deface me  I will but smile at the uplifted steel  And bless you while you kill me  MENTEVOLE  Have a care  I mean thee no dishonour but these struggles  That heaving bosom those resistless beams  Darting their subtle heat through all my frame  May fire my senses to so wild a tumult  JULIA  O fatal thought I will choke in my breath  Fall lifeless here Is there no pitying power  Are prayers in vain above  MENTEVOLE  As empty air  Love only wakes for he inspires my ardour  O fond reluctance must I call for aid  No gently thus  stooping to raise her in the struggle the dagger falls from his breast which she seizes instantly and rises  JULIA  Ha was it sent from heaven  Lo thine own dagger See I grasp it strongly  Now monster I defy thee  MENTEVOLE  Plagues confusion  JULIA  The righteous guardian of the innocent  Has look'd from yon bright firmament to earth  And sends this timely succour  MENTEVOLE  Meddling daemons  In black confed'racy combin'd against me  Turn all my engines to their own destruction  Yet hear with patience  JULIA  If thou dar'st approach me  Stir but thy foot or call thy bate associates  Swift as the ray that darts from yonder orb  I feel the artery here this friendly point  Shall pierce my heart and as death's shades close round me  I'll bless the night which shuts thee out for ever  MENTEVOLE  Obdurate as thou art alas my dotage  Would still preserve thee and implores thee pardon  The mad attempt by desperation prompted  JULIA  Sunk to the lowest in my esteem before  Lower thou could'st not fall Degrading guilt  How mean how abject are the souls which own thee  How vile thy thraldom See the baffled ruffian  Though bravoes lurk all round to abet his fury  Abash'd and pale before an injur'd woman  MENTEVOLE  I must endure it allperfidious fortune  JULIA  But lo my father and Marcellus near  Keep thy dark secret for I will not rouse  Their indignation to demand thy life  And snatch the forfeit from impending justice  Thou should'st not die so nobly Hence begone  JULIA  throws down the dagger and exit  SCENE VI  MENTEVOLE  alone  Again I grasp thee faithless instrument  takes up the dagger  Revenge that latest sunshine of the accurs'd  If I must perish still may gild my downfall  Exit  THE END OF THE FOURTH ACT  ACT V  SCENE I  A Chamber in  Durazzo's  Palace  JULIA  and  MARCELLUS  MARCELLUS  'Tis true too true my astonish'd eyes beheld it  The duke is come is in the hall this instant  And shame to Genoa armed guards are posted  To save this palace from the people's outrage  JULIA  O if my prayers have any power to move you  Or if you would not add to my distress  Most sure you cannot mean it I implore you  Wide as if spotted plagues encompass'd me  Avoid me fly me in fierce Fulvia's presence  MARCELLUS  With joy in all but this I would obey you  Shall I retire and seem to abet a cause  By tame neutrality and timorous silence  Which but to think of chills my heart's warm blood  And drives my sober sense to wild amazement  JULIA  Think then what I feel here yet O remember  She has a parent's claim to your respect  And how I lov'd her heaven that knows can witness  In publick to confront her might enkindle  Her rage to madness Has she not accus'd me  O that I could forget it of such crimes  As calumny's foul lips might shrink to utter  MARCELLUS  Her's is the shame but our's alas the anguish  JULIA  Stung thus to frenzy she would hurl on me  Your disobedience all her house's woe  Impute to me alone unhappy me  While trembling sinking I could but oppose  The feeble shield of innocence and tears  No justice must for once give way to duty  MARCELLUS  O do not freeze me with so cold a word  Nor wrong the ardours of my glowing bosom  JULIA  The great disposer of events on earth  For some unsearchable mysterious end  Has pleas'd to mark me for adversity  With constancy unshaken my firm soul  Shall meet the black succession of my fates  When the full storm has emptied all its fury  This shatter'd bark may sink at length to peace  And the last wave that rolls the welcome death  Bury my muchwrong'd name in cold oblivion  MARCELLUS  What eye that with delight has gaz'd on beauty  What ear that e'er was ravish'd with sweet sounds  Who that has sense and soul to feel perfection  And witness'd thy unrivall'd excellence  Can let thee be forgotten Hear O hear me  I Can no more suppress my burning passion  It will have way My fate is in thy breath  And all my enamour'd soul enslav'd adores thee  JULIA  Marcellus  MARCELLUS  Ha that cold averted brow  Presumptuous man bespeaks my doom too plainly  JULIA  Is this an hour for love  MARCELLUS  At every hour  Enchanting as thou art thy eyes command it  Thus on my knee I seize the blest occasion  To tell thee all thy wond'rous charms inspire  Though ages might glide by ere half was utter'd  JULIA  There is an aweful witness of this scene  For ever present here who hovers round me  Through the still void I hear a solemn voice  On his pale lips the unwilling accents hang  Our vows he cries were register'd above  For thee my breast was pierc'd see this red wound  Nor lose the memory in a brother's arms  MARCELLUS  What canst thou mean Why do thy lovely eyes  Thus waste their beams on air O turn them here  To warm my breast and light up ecstacy  JULIA  May ghastly spectres deck my bridal couch  Hemlock and poisonous weeds be strew'd for flowers  The nuptial torch scatter despair and death  And mutter'd curses blast the unhallow'd rite  If my false hand receive another love  Or my frail heart forget its early passion  MARCELLUS  O fatal sound my inauspicious sighs  Awake no gentle sympathy for me  But fan the flame for a dead rival's ashes  JULIA  All the most tender interest can inspire  Soft friendship and an anxious sister's kindness  Unask'd I offer but of love no more  The object and the passion died with him  MARCELLUS  Too near and too remote It cannot be  For O 'tis lingering torment hourly death  To touch the cup might quench our fever's thirst  And know we must not taste it Angels guard you  Farewel Let chance direct my wandering way  The world without thee has no choice for me  Exit  MARCELLUS  SCENE II  JULIA  alone  Most brave most generous and by me undone  Judge of the secret heart what unknown sin  Did I commit that fate stands ready arm'd  To visit all whose peace is dear to me  Take me O take me to thy wish'dfor rest  And leave mankind to their own destiny  Exit  SCENE III  A magnificent Hall in  Durazzo's  Palace The  Duke  of  Genoa  with Guards and other Attendants in the center  FULVIA  c on one side  DURAZZO CAMILLO  and  JULIA  with their Attendants on the other  FULVIA  I have obey'd the summons of your grace  Yet when I see the seat of justice chang'd  From the grave bench where once she us'd to frown  Even to the chambers of my adversaries  I look for such an issue as hereafter  Will make this novelty no precedent  But to be shun'd and noted for the abuse  DUKE  The sanctity of justice is the heart  Of him who judges place makes no distinction  And when the veil of passion is remov'd  When with clear eyes you see the good we mean you  Yourself I know will thank us for this course  And own our swerving from the common form  Was kind to all concern'd  FULVIA  May it prove so  JULIA  You see me here brought for so strange a cause  I can but with astonishment look round  Nor know I whom to oppose or what to answer  'Tis hard to make my affliction my offence  And the black deed which saddens all my days  The source the bitter source of every sorrow  The ground to load me with reproach and shame  Yet here am I accus'dI cannot speak it  Accus'd of whatTo say I am innocent  Would be such mean such base indignity  To the great spirit of my exalted love  I'd rather burst with the proud sense of scorn  And leave my silence to your worst surmise  Than utter such a word  DUKE  O 'tis too much  DURAZZO  You are appris'd my lord with what intent  My daughter secretly this morning sought  A meeting with Mentevole  DUKE  I know it  And grieve to find so gentle an intent  Has met such hard construction from good Fulvia  FULVIA  Reserve my lord your pity till we ask it  And counsel ignorance We know our purposeâ–ª  DUKE  As we our duty And behold the man  First in our present search  takes his seat  SCENE IV  Enter  MENTEVOLE  Know you my lord  Why we assemble here  MENTEVOLE  Yes Clamour's throat  Has roar'd it in our streets I pass'd along  Through files of obloquy Our sapient rabble  Reverse the order of the magistracy  And ere they hear condemn us  DUKE  Then my lord  As you regard your honour and your life  Touch'd by suspicion to the quick this instant  Account for your possession of that picture  That lady there dead Claudio's mother swears  It was her son's and worn around his neck  The day he disappear'd Behold do you know it  Do you allow you dropp'd it  MENTEVOLE  Yes but not  That it was Claudio's Yet I cannot wonder  Two objects so alike should seem the same  FULVIA  Should  seem  the same  DUKE  Have patience gentle lady  MENTEVOLE  I say should  seem  for it is barely seeming  From that which Claudio own'd the artist's boast  Myself not meanly in the science skill'd  Painted this picture love my pencil's guide  And from the image in my heart engrav'd  Assisted by the model such I made it  That not the most discerning nicest eye  From the first beauteous draught could know that copy  FULVIA  And had you skill to paint those jewels too  Those jewels in the round their hue and lustre  So singular and bright By every power  These were my son's  MENTEVOLE  No Give me hearing madam  Those too I purchas'd from the very merchant  Who furnish'd Claudio All who hear me know  The name of Manoa his services  To this ungrateful state his flight his death  Which I lament since living he could witness  And strike you dumb that by my special order  He chose these precious gems in form and colour  So like to Claudio's none could mark distinction  To pay their value my estate was strain'd  But had their estimation been twice doubled  A crown imperial deem'd the mighty price  Rather than yield him preference in aught  Might seem a test of my extravagant love  I would have grasp'd at it and so remain'd  The ruin'd happy lord of that sole treasure  Now learn from hence how wisdom should demur  To found a sentence on appearances  Your grace is satisfied  Here  DURAZZO  whispers  CAMILLO  who goes out  DUKE  I own to me  No proof appearing to the contrary  If this be so your honour seems acquitted  FULVIA  But not to me O undiscerning lord  Is this your inquisition this your justice  I am not satisfied my heart still tells me  That picture was my son's so reason tells me  Nor should a voucher from the yawning grave  Shake my convictionThat good Manoa  Did sell these jewels to my slaughter'd son  And he 'tis true conveniently is dead  But he had heirs and kindred summon them  A treasure such as this could not be sold  Without their knowledge instantly convene them  And act through shame as if you sought for truth  Else your grave robes will be the jest of boys  And my son's blood will cry till death against you  MENTEVOLE  Do not suppose I scoff at this grave presence  When thus I smile in my security  Produce such witnesses what could they prove  Their ignorance perhaps in what you ask them  But we have clear and positive laws to guard us  JULIA  So long I have said little fearful ever  To give offence where all my care has been  To manifest respect esteem and honour  Even with a daughter's duteous humbleness  But thus much let me add I here disclaim  As most abhorrent to my thoughts and nature  All common interest union and accord  With him for whom I suffer in the censure  Of that ungentle lady and believe  Firmly like her that picture was her son's  And there before you stands his murderer  MENTEVOLE  Why stay I here My lord if you have power  To give me reparation for the stain  Cast on my honour by this foolish process  Pronounce it straight if not thus I withdraw  From those vex'd eyes which glare with fury on me  DURAZZO  Soft you a while for lo you who comes here  Even to your wish to make all clear for you  SCENE V  Reenter  CAMILLO  leading in  MANOA  MENTEVOLE  starting  Swallow me earth he lives But I must brave it  DUKE  rising  Ha can I trust my senses Manoa  DURAZZO  The same my lord and by no miracle  DUKE  Yet things so strange are next to miracles  And his appearance such We thought him dead  This is beyond your hopes  to  MENTEVOLE  MENTEVOLE  O much beyond them  All curses of his nation light upon him  aside  JULIA  The villain's cheek turns pale his fate has found him  aside  DUKE  Surprise to see you here no way abates  to  MANOA  Our pleasure at your welfare Blushing deeply  We own the state has wrong'd you but soon purpose  To give you full redress  MANOA  My humblest thanks  DUKE  takes is seat  At present we must set aside that care  For one which now employs us No more thanks  We yet deserve them notCome nearer still  gives  MANOA  the picture  Take this examine it Do you remember  Observe them well the jewels round that picture  MANOA  Most sure my lord they are by no means common  But all indeed most rare and singular  DUKE  They once were yours Who was their purchaser  MANOA  A noble youth by whose untimely death  Genoa has lost her brightest ornament  Even in the depth of my own misery  My heart dropp'd blood to hear the fate of Claudio  DUKE  Did you at any time think ere you answer  Procure for any other purchaser  Jewels like these  MANOA  Never my lord  MENTEVOLE  Out dotard  Thy miseries have craz'd thy memory  To me these gems were sold look on me well  I was the friend of Claudio think old man  A noble person's life and reputation  More dear than life hang on the words you utter  MANOA  I've said what I have said were my soul's fate  Link'd to the testimony thus I stake it  As I do hops forgiveness of my sins  And peace in death I never sold these gems  Nor any like them save to noble Claudio  DUKE  Hear you my lord  MENTEVOLE  I hear a faithless Jew  A slave suborn'd a traitor to the state  A bankrupt fugitive and outcast Hebrew  Averhe knows not whatand still more strange  I see the credulous duke of Genoa  The first in estimation as in place  Gaping to swallow monstrous perjuries  MANOA  What interest lord have I to do this wrong  I enter'd uninstructed of the cause  For which you summon'd me nor know I now  Why I am thus revil'd for my true answer  DUKE  to  MENTEVOLE  It can avail you nought to disallow  The proof yourself appeal'd to  MANOA  Mighty signor  I have an attestation of my truth  Beyond all oaths or sacred form of words  If I am not a liar and suborn'd  There rests within this frame a spring conceal'd  With nicest art and known to me alone  And its first master Touch'd it will discover  The noble Claudio's imageAy 'tis here  Illfated youthIs this to be a liar  He touches a spring and shews a picture of  CLAUDIO  beneath that of  JULIA  JULIA  eagerly  Give me that picture O my promis'd love  This was thy form Thy brow the throne of honour  And grace thy ministerFor ever gone  So look'd those glossy eyes when turn'd on Julia  Cold is that tongueCome animating warmth  Breathe through my lips give life to this dear shade  And let me die thus gazing  MENTEVOLE  Daemons seize thee  to  MANOA  Cramps and cold palsies wither thy curs'd hand  Thou hast undone me  DUKE  rising  Sir you are our prisoner  And in our palace you must hear your sentence  Bear him away this instant  Two of the Guards attempt to seize him  MENTEVOLE  Stand aloof  Nor raise a hand in violence against me  Or with one stroke I'll frustrate all your forms  And the dark tale dies with me  DUKE  Holdlet's hear him  MENTEVOLE  I did kill Claudio On the morn you miss'd him  We took together our accustom'd walk  When this too certain arm achiev'd the deed  Which long lay brooding in my jealousy  FULVIA  Deliberate curs'd assassin  JULIA  O my heart  MENTEVOLE  He talk'd with rapture of the approaching bliss  Till passion drown'd his sight with eyes upcast  Then drew that picture hanging round his neck  From underneath his garment glew'd his lips  With transport to the beauteous lifeless form  My smother'd fury rose at once to madness  With one hand from his grasp I tore the picture  And with the other smote him to the heart  JULIA  faints  DURAZZO  My daughter ha the blood forsakes her cheeks  My life my all look up  FULVIA  running to  JULIA  Dear injur'd maid  Live but to see my penitence my tears  Thou lovely sufferer O wake and hear me  Alas she heeds me not My barbarous tongue  Sharp as the felon's steel was fatal to thee  See she revives  DURAZZO  Thank heaven she breathes again  JULIA  O who has call'd me back to this dark world  From choirs of angels and celestial light  To view that murderer Yet  let  me view him  For I would find the speediest way to peace  And in the hollow of his cruel eye  There should be mortal mischief freezing terror  To stop the tide of natureMonster think  Pain ignominy death which wait thee here  Will have their lengthen'd end but to consign thee  To everduring misery hereafter  MENTEVOLE  My sentence here I know the rest's uncertain  But least of all fair sorceress that tongue  Should aggravate the crime those eyes persuaded  Thou thou the cause of all this guilt and ruin  Why did I kill my friend Why but for thee  Why risk my soul's perdition Still for thee  Why forfeit life and honour All for thee  Then where should I seek vengeance but from thee  And thus insulted love thus bids me take it  He stabs  JULIA  and attempts to stab himself but is prevented  JULIA  Ha  DURAZZO  Seize his arm O execrable wretch  Fly fly for succour See she bleeds she dies  The fiend the inhuman fiend has kill'd my daughter  DUKE  Quick bear him hence each hour while he draws breath  All laws divine and human are insulted  Exit  DUKE  MENTEVOLE  'Tis done I laugh at you Your triumph's past  See there the last despair of outraged love  Now plunge me in your dungeons tire your code  To wake new torments for me The great spirit  Which dared such deeds shall brave their penalty  MENTEVOLE  is carried off  DURAZZO  Good heaven in pity to a father's anguish  Let me not lose her thusmy child my child  JULIA  The pain of this deep wound is light my father  But O to think that your declining age  Will want the comfort of a daughter's care  That cold obedience must discharge the office  Affection made so welcome to your Julia  DURAZZO  My heart's best blood I shall not long survive thee  FULVIA  Hide me O earth I tremble to approach  Has thy soft generous heart one drop of mercy  To fall upon a wretch whose savage fury  Outraged thy virtues pierc'd thy tender soul  Mocking thy bitterest pangs O Julia Julia  kneeling  JULIA  Rise madam rise These supplicating hands  Your streaming eyes and that respected body  Thus bow'd with grief and groveling on the earth  Are sights unfit for her whose dying beams  With tender reverence must still behold you  Alas resentment at this awful moment  Can find no place in my departing spirit  For all will soon be peace  FULVIA  Thou saintlike goodness  Unmov'd I saw thy tears saw the sweet blush  Of thy wrong'd innocence For pity hate me  In life in death rise not so much above me  JULIA  Give me your hand my last tears fall upon it  As these dissolving drops part from my eyes  So melts the memory of all past unkindness  FULVIA  O could they quench my everlasting shame  MARCELLUS  without  I will not be withheld  Enters  O grief and horrour  Why why did I obeythy cruel order  Kept me far off My presence might have saved thee  The ruthless ruffian in my faithful breast  Should first have drench'd his steel These fruitless tears  Are all I now have left thee  JULIA  Thus 'tis better  A life of sorrow such alas was mine  Is well exchang'd for bless'd eternity  Thine shall be long and happy  MARCELLUS  Never never  Infinite woe from this black hour awaits me  Yet let me print on that pale beauteous hand  One sad adieu O that my soul could pass thus  By every sacred power that hears I swear  My lips thus hallow'd by this holy kiss  Shall ne'er again  JULIA  eagerly  As you regard my peace  My last my earnest prayer let no rash vow  Blasting the hopes of all your noble race  Replunge the dagger in my bleeding bosom  MARCELLUS  Yet there are means of death  FULVIA  My best Marcellus  JULIA  to  FULVIA  I beg you do not leave my poor remains  But lighten that sad office to my father  DURAZZO  O misery  JULIA  taking papers from her breast  These paperspray observe me  Bury these papers with me Lay that picture  Close to my heart and let my coffin rest  In the same tomb which holds my murder'd Claudio  One love one death and the same sepulchre  I thank your tender tearsFountain of mercy  Mild peace and heavenly light dawn on my sense  My pains grow less this load will soon fall off  I shall be happy Weep not Mercy Oh  Dies  Curtain falls  THE END OF THE FIFTH ACT  EPILOGUE  Written by JOHN COURTENAY Esq  Spoken by Mrs SIDDONS  THOUGH tender sighs breathe in the tragick page  What lover now complainsbut on the stage  No suitor now attempts his rival's life  But lets him take that cordial balma wife  And yet to prove his pure and constant flame  Still loves his mistress in the wedded dame  Still courts his friend and still devoutly bows  At the fair shrine where first he breath'd his vows  For love she knows some gratitude is due  Searches her heart and finds there's room for two  And often sees her coy reluctance o'er  Good cause to prize her  caro sposo  more  Thus modish wives with sentimental spirit  May go astray to prove their husbands' merit  Or ope the door in this commodious age  Without death's aid to 'scape from wedlock's cage  Abjuring rules that soon will seem romance  Love's gayer system we import from France  Rescind politely our old English  duty  And take off all restraints from wine and beauty  While lighter manners cheer our native gloom  As Spanish wool refines the British loom  Had fashion's law of old such influence shed  The raptur'd Claudio ne'er had timeless bled  His bliss with joy Mentevole had seen  And Julia's favourite Cicishe' had been  The assiduous lover and the husband bland  Like Brentford's kings had still walk'd hand in hand  Together still had shone at Park and play  Quaffing the fragrance of the same bouquet  Our varlet poet with licentious speech  Thus far our injur'd sex has dar'd  impeach  The female character thus rudely slurr'd  'Tis fit at last that  I  should have a word  First then without rejoinder or dispute  This  virtuous  circle might each  charge  refute  That 'tis a  nuptial age  I sure may say  With their own wives when husbands run away  But truce with jest Howe'er the wits may rail  The cause of truth and virtue must prevail  Of former times whatever may be told  We are just as good as e'er they were of old  Connubial Love here long has fix'd his throne  And bliss is ours to foreign climes unknown  If  now and then  a tripping fair is sound  On Scandal's wings the buzzing tale flies round  While blameless  thousands  in sequester'd life  Adorn each state of parent friend and wife  From private cares ne'er wish abroad to roam  And bless each day the sunshine of their home  Unnoticed keep their noiseless happy course  Nor dream of second wedlock or divorce  I see the verdict's ours you smile applause  So with your leave again I'll plead our cause  New triumphs nightly o'er this railer gain  And to the last our female rights maintain  FINIS
