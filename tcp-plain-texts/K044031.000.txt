 REMARKS ON SOME OBSERVATIONS ON Dr BROWN'S DISSERTATION ON POETRY and MUSICK In a LETTER to the AUTHOR of the OBSERVATIONS  LONDON Printed for L DAVIS and C REYMERS against  Gray'sInnGate Holborn  Printers to the Royal Society MDCCLXIV  REMARKS  c  I Address the following Remarks to you not because I pretend to guess at your Person but because I think you are most interested in them and I send you them plain and simple without prefacing them either with Compliments or Acrimony  I entirely agree with you in your first general Observation P that of most if not  "all Arts or Exertions of human Faculty those which Dr Brown has chosen for his Subject are most liable to be influenced by a Variety of Causes seemingly most remote and minute and most difficult to be observed"  But surely your Conclusion is not logical  "That to think by laying down one or a few Principles to deduce the Progress of them systematically is parallel to  Almanackmakers  foretelling the Weather"  In my Opinion the present Question is not whether they can be solved systematically or not but whether Dr B's Solution is just or groundless And if  you apply this Conclusion to his Work before you have examined it your Determination must be ranked with the Judgments of those Countries where they  behead  a Man first and try afterwards whether he is Guilty  Your second Observation is of the  "Unimportance of such Investigations as being mere amusing Gratifications of Curiosity"  Yet if you are really in earnest how came you who have affected to display so large a Fund of Reading to have  "  P  employed so much of your Thoughts on a  small Part  of this very Subject And  Ibid  if ever you publish your Thoughts"  I appeal to your own Heart in what Estimation you would hold the Man who should tell you they were of  "no Importance to Mankind or rank  them  as you have done Dr B's with  Almanackmaking  Your third Objection  "of the doctorial Manner and Air of Science with which it has been fashionable of late to advance Conjectures"  is at least not liberal If Dr B's Conjectures are false it  ought  to be Triumph enough for you to prove them so if on the contrary notwithstanding your Arguments they prove  true ought  they not to be advanced with the Confidence of Truth by a Man who knows them  so"  I entirely acquiesce in your fourth Observation  "that since Truth is the principal Purpose these Investigations can answer  Misrepresentation  or even  Error  in matter of Fact is less excusable in them than in any other Kind of Enquiry"  except in such as  your's  and  mine  where if we  misrepresent  either thro'  Prejudice  or  Partiality  or  err  in Matters of Fact when we would correct the  Errors  of others then we are  less excusable  because we are  less honest  So much may suffice for your Preliminaries The Body of your Work remains now to be examined  You say  "I will not take the Advantage of the obvious Ridicule which arises from the searching the Seeds and Principles of all the most refined and transporting Poetry of Greece in the dreary Wilds of NorthAmerica  P  "  'Tis indeed out of the common road for Dr B to carry us so  far  in Quest of  Brutality  when he might have found it so much nearer Home among the old  Pelasgi  of ancient  Greece  who certainly were no better than the modern  Iroquois  We know they were  AcornEaters  and  ManEaters  Sylvestres Homines  Sacer Interpresque Deorum  Caedibus    Victu foedo  deterruit ORPHEUS  Horace  This is the most we know of them and this we know of the modern  Iroquois  too but then we know  a great dealmore  Now what we know of the  mordern Iroquois  Dr B on the Foundation of  Analogy  applies to the  old Pelasgi  He attempts  to prove by an easy Chain of Reasoning that in Case of a supposed Civilization of  Iroquois  such Consequences might naturally be expected to arise as did actually arise in  antient Greece  and  viceversa  that as the  old Pelasgi  were once in the same State as the  Iroquois  are now they actually did proceed by the same Steps as these would probably do upon a similar Civilization The Argument is new I confess but is not therefore to be treated with Contempt If the Principles on which all Savage Tribes proceed are  always  simple and nearly the same in all making only some small Allowance for the Difference of Soil and Climate If the Similarity of Causes and Effects be too clear and convincing to be denied in a Word if even where Variations of Character arise they serve rather to illustrate than confound the Subject certainly any Conclusions properly drawn from so amazing an Analogy must fall little short of DemonstrationThe Method then of Argumentation no rational Man can object to let us therefore see whether Dr Bhas sustained it properly in those Parts which regard ancient Greece  You begin with a very material Point which if once made out would overthrow Dr B's Hypothesis from the Foundation You tell us  "It is taken for granted all along that the Poetry and Music and Legislation and Religion of Greece were entirely the spontaneous Productions of that Climate"  but that  "it is certain the first Seeds  of them were imported  P  "  You then appeal to ancient Authors and affirm from them that Dr B's System  "cannot hold since their  first Civilizers  did certainly introduce  foreign Gods  and  were not the Object of Worship themselves  P    To prove that it was otherwise you cite  Herodotus  and you say  "he assures us that the Pelasgi had no more than some general Notion of  a superior Power  who  made  the World  P  "  Now how can  You  whose Work professes to be built on the Pillar of  strict Quotation  how can  You  begin with so egregious an Untruth In your Translation you have represented the PELASGI  AcornEaters  and  ManEaters  as  pure Theists  and it seems it was  Orpheus  who  afterwards  debased them into gross  Idolaters  Euterpe l  Now  Herodotus  says nothing of all this He mentions not  a superior Power  but expressly says  Gods    nor does he speak one Word of their  making  but only of their  governing  the World  P  And is not this a palmary Argument in Proof of their having no Religion that  "they  worshiped  the  Gods  who in their Opinion  governed the World"  Well but it seems  "they knew no Name for any Divinity the Names of their Gods were brought from Egypt and if their Gods had been their own Chiefs  their  Names would have been better remembered than  any Thing else  P  "  Here I confess with Pleasure is some Appearance of good Reasoning  But to set this Matter in its true Light and acquaint you whence it probably came to pass that the  savage Pelasgi  had no Names for their Gods I must in Imitation of Dr B carry you once more among your new Acquaintances the Savages of AmericaYou must know then that the savage Tribes seldom retain the  particular Name  of the  Chieftain  whom they  deify  and  worship  and the Reason of this is because he generally  loses  it even  before be dies  When he is exalted to the Rank of  Chief  his former Name is commonly dropped and a new Appellation is given him suited to the Station he is raised to This Title rather than Name is generally that of  Father Senior  or  Sun  of the Tribe In Proof of this I might refer you to all the Writers on the Manners of savage Tribes On this Subject however LAFITAU and the  Lettres Edifiantes  will give you ample Satisfaction Under this State of Things the savage Tribes offer Sacrifice consult Oracles and perform the general Acts of a native Religion This then seems to have been the idolatrous State of the old Pelasgi They probably worshipped their first savage Chieftains for it is clear on the Evidence of  Herodotus  himself that they offered  Sacrifice  to their Gods and  consulted  the  Oracle  of  Dodona  whether  they should give the  Egyptian Names  to  their own Deities  Herod ib  two Circumstances which prove even to Demonstration that they had Deities before the Time of Orpheus  You will say  "what then did Orpheus introduce if he introduced not the Gods of Greece"  Why Herodotus tells us as plain as Words can tell us He introduced  Mysteries    and that he might distinguish the native Gods whom he found already established by a general Worship he appropriated particular Rites to each and to this End very properly distinguished each God by a particular Appellation But sure never was Critic so unlucky in his Remarks as You For it has been made appear by a learned Writer that these  these very  Mysteries  which ORPHEUS introduced to Greece were so far from being the  Beginnings  of  Heroe Worship  that they were intended as a  Detection  to the  initiated  of the  Errors  of  preestablished Polytheism  Div Leg of Moses B ii Sect    It appears then that the  oldest Gods  of Greece were strictly  native  I shall now prove that they were the  Chiefs  and  first Civilizers  of the savage Inhabitants That they were such is evident from the Testimony of several ancient Authors founded on the Traditions of the Country which are the only original Evidences that can be obtained in a Case of this NatureThe first and chief of these was He to whom  Orpheus  it seems gave  the Name of JUPITER This old Chieftain was born in Crete and was brought young by his Mother into Greece  Strabo l x  He conquered the  Titans  probably another Tribe of Savages at Enmity with the  Pelasgi  and civilized the Inhabitants of the Country which he subdued  Diodorus l iii  After he had vanquished the  Titans  he is said by some Authors to have instituted the Olympian Games in Commemoration of his Victory  Pausanias l v    Another of these most ancient Gods of Greece to whom ORPHEUS gave the Name of APOLLO was a Chief who killed the Serpent  Python  and the Tyrant  Titius  taught the Inhabitants of Greece the Use of the Fruits of the Earth and civilized the Inhabitants of several Districts  Strabo l ix    Two more of these ancient Gods of Greece were the famed Brothers CASTOR and POLLUX They were Natives of the little Isle of  Pephnos  near  Messene  Pausanias l  and taught the Lacedemonians the Arts of Dancing and of War  Lucian de Saltatione    Now these  four  are the very  ancient Gods  whom Dr B has singled out as being delivered down to Posterity under the Characters of Musicians Singers and Dancers All of them Chiefs and Civilizers of ancient Greece in some Department or other of Legislation  But he might have added several more Of this Class was MERCURY He was born in  Greece  Pausanias Arcad  was the  Inventor  of the  Lyre  and is said to have been deified for this Invention  Eliac    Another Deification I must not pass over You have led me to it yourself It is that of BACCHUS whose Love of Wine Dance and Music is too well known to need a Comment You speak of his Mysteries as being not of Grecian but foreign Original and thence you conclude that the God himself was so I need hardly bid you turn back to the preceding Pages to put you in Mind how inconclusive this Argument is The  old Chieftain  himself was a Civilizer of  Greece  tho' his  Mysteries  introduced by ORPHEUS were  Egyptian  You will demand a Proof of the God being a Civilizer of Greece Take the following Account then which unfortunately contains as ample a Confutation of all you have advanced on this Subject as any Heart can wish  "PHILONIDES informs us that the Vine having been transplated from the Borders of the  Red Sea  into  Greece  by BACCHUSthe Greeks when the unmixed Wine is brought to Table at Supper invoke the good Genius or God honouring or worshipping the Power who invented it This God is BACCHUS  Athen Deip l xv  "  Thus your capital Objection to Dr B's System seems absolutely untenable and void of all Foundation  You proceed next to object against his Account of the Origin of  poetic Numbers  P c  What you have advanced on this Subject I shall only stile an Instance of your  Power of Representation  You confound the Origin of  Poetry  with the Origin of  mere Rythm  nor perhaps is it necessary that a mere Critic should know the DifferenceYou represent Savages in their lowest State of Nature to have no Leisure for Amusement when if you will  read  you will  find  they have  more  Leisure than any  civilized  NationsYou charge Dr B with representing them as going formally to Work with an  apriori Notion  of Harmony and Measure to adapt their Words to Music when in Reality he tells you from  Lafitau  that they dance and sing and join their Words to their Music as well as they can and to this End that they  "even retrench and strike off some Syllables from their Words"  that they  "may tally better with their Dance and Music and hence the natural Origin of Rythm or Numbers"  You own that the Dance  cannot be totally without Measure  and yet you deny its Tendency to produce a  correspondent Measure  in the  annexed Words  You say that violent Emotions of the Mind naturally produce harmonious Periods yet though you are very angry through your whole Work you never produce one harmonious PeriodSuch  are the Materials of this Article which I shall leave to the Reader's Contemplations  But you have not yet done with the old Deities of Greece You say you remember a  "Passage of ARISTOTLE full in the Teeth of Dr B's System wherein it is observed that "the Poets never represent Jupiter singing  P  "  Truly neither does Dr B for he only says on the Authority of a very old Poet that  "Jupiter  danced"  'Tis a little hard upon the Father of Gods and Men thus to tie him Hand and Foot because he wanted an  Ear  or happened to be  hoarse  and because he did not  sing  that you won't let him  dance  neither Good Sir be a little more ingenuous in your Application of ancient Authors  But you affirm that  "Arctinus mentions Jupiter's Dancing as a Thing  unusual  lb  "  Now why did not you refer to the Passage in Athenaeus which you here allude to Was it for Fear the Reader might consult itWith some Trouble I have found it and am sorry to say I have detected you in what an illiberal Critic would call a downright Falsehood The following is a literal Translation of the Passage  "Eumelus  or  Arctinus  the Corinthian somewhere introduces Jupiter dancing saying "Among them danced the Sire of Gods and Men  Deip l i  "  Not a Syllable occurs here on its being either an  usual  or  unusual Thing  But it seems  "the Character of the Poet should be ascertained whether serious or burlesque c before any thing concerning the whole System of Grecian Religion be determined by one Quotation at Secondhand from him  P  "  You are a notable LogicianBut it happens that the Proof of Dr B's System does not depend upon this one Quotation he has in the Course of his Dissertation given twenty more which are generally corroborative of This  You next come to consider Dr B's Account of the Origin of Poetic History You charge Dr B with misquoting and misrepresenting the Author of the Life of Homer in order to bring him to his own Purpose  P  But in reality all that Dr B has done is to express that  properly  which the Author of the Life of Homer had expressed  improperly  Both their Expressions imply the same Thing You farther charge Dr B indeed with  "turning  Spanish  Works into  Arabic  ones  P  "  Now these Spanish Fragments are indeed Arabic by Descent and this is evidently Dr B's Meaning But You I find being ignorant of their Original did not comprehend his Meaning  On the Subject of  "ancient Laws being written in Verse"  you say  "the Actions of their Gods and Heroes were such as could not  be a Foundation for moral Exhortations to Imitation  P  "  Here I suspect that instead of putting  yourself  in the Place of the  Savages  you have put the  Savages  in  your Place  Certainly to a  modern Englishman  the Actions of their Gods and Heroes could never have seemed a worthy Model for Imitation Yet to an ancient savage Greek an AcornEater and a ManEater they might very well pass for such  "Plunder and Revenge as you observe  P  being what the Savage chiefly values"  an Exhortation to this Purpose would naturally be included in the SongFeast  You say  "I would fain know why the Doctor should suppose the Practice of  religious Dance  and  Song  to have  necessarily arisen  from a  false Religion  which as he himself takes Notice made a Part of the  true  P  "  But where has the Doctor asserted that they  necessarily arose  That they  naturally  arose both among  Pagans  and  Jews  he has made it very evident Now why should we have Recourse to a pedantic Principle of  Imitation  void of Evidence for a Practice which manifestly arises from  Nature  I expect you will prove in your next Work that all  Pagans  learnt of the  Jews  how to beget Children and eat their Victuals  You now come to the old poetic Oracles of GREECE So far as the Affair of mere Reasoning  is concerned I shall again leave you to the natural Penetration of the Reader With Respect to the literary Part of the Argument I at length give you Joy of a small Discovery for you have detected Dr B in calling an ancient Priestess of Apollo by the Name of PHEMONOE instead of HEROPHILE I wish you had been as successful in your next Attack  For the main Point worth contending for an this Subject is  "Whether the ancient Pythian Oracles were the Effect of Enthusiasm"  To prove that they were not you bring a Story from Homer who tells us of a wonderful Feat of APOLLO who st changed himself into a Dolphin dly drove the Cretan Voyagers from their Course at Sea dly appeared to them Qu in his own Shape or the Dolphin's and told them they were to be his Sacrificers thly that the poor Fellows being hungry he assured them they need not fear for a Subsistence for that he could foretel they should live comfortably on the Sacrifices on which they believed him and became his PriestsNow on this curious and authentic Trait of History which you call  rational  and  probable  you found the Rise of the Delphic Oracle Believe your Creed who may I shall not endeavour to shake his Faith But in Respect to those who may think that any thing can possibly be fabulous which comes from that most  scrupulous  and  true Historian Old  HOMER I can only set against him the weak Authority of that poetical  and lying Romancer DIODORUS the  Sicilian  Now this Author tells us in the most express Terms that  "the Rise of this famed Oracle was from Enthusiasm That the first Diviners being seized with this began to prophecy and were agitated with  wild and frantic Gestures  which were so violent that many of them leapt into the deep Cleft of the Earth near the Place where now the Temple of Delphi stands And that in Process of Time the Diviner or Pythia was  confined  to the  Tripos  as the Means of  preventing  the  like  fatal  Consequences  Diodorus l  "  This whole Account confirms all that Dr B has advanced concerning the Origin of the old poetic Oracles of GREECE it overturns all the Objections you have mustered on this Subject And as to the illiberal Misrepresentations of Dr B's Method of Reasoning which close your Argument I am quite ashamed of them and might give you for Answer a Maxim of your own  "that a Buffoon always places Things in that Light which is most advantageous to his Satire  P  "  On the Subject of the Greek Melody you say  "you have little to object"  and for the same Reason perhaps I have nothing to object and I fear the Reason is because we do not understand itHowever you are even with him in the next Paragraph in which you prove yourself  a greater Adept in Prosody not only than Dr B but even than the learned  Vossius  himself And here you have laid hold of a fair Opportunity of exposing Dr B for  another Man's Ignorance  at least if  not  for  his own  On this important Head therefore I will lay down a Brace of Maxims built on your most ingenious Criticism which I defy him and all his Adherents to overturn That a Writer is answerable for any incidental Error of the Author whom he quotes though it be not essential to his Subject That though the Author who  made  a trifling Mistake may be a Man of  Sense  and  Learning  yet he who  passes  it unnoticed  must  be an  ignorant Blockhead  You own that  "the Power of the Greek Melody is justly attributed by Dr B to the  Power of Association  P  "    "But"  Ay right or wrong there must be a  but  "But this is in Effect owning that it is in a great Measure unaccountable  Ib  "  Let us see now how this Argument standsIf we know that it is  justly  attributed to  Association  then surely we know what  Association  means and if so then I apprehend it is clearly  accounted for  Had I not been tolerably acquainted with you before I arrived at this logical Paragraph I should have wondered to hear a Man  saying  and  unsaying  the  same  thing  at a BreathWell but we will pass over this as one of those Propositions you speak of which are  neither true  nor  false  We will suppose that all you mean to assert is only what follows  "that their  particular Associations  being  unknown  the  particular  Nature of their  Melody  which arose from  these Associations  must be  unknown likewise"  This is a Proposition which has both Sense and Truth in it  But then  unluckily for you it is the very thing that Dr B asserts For he tells you even again and again that notwithstanding all the Pretences of your whole critical Fraternity we know nothing particular about the Matter  But now you hasten into the midst of things and to confess the Truth take such Strides in Absurdity that it requires some Pains to follow youDr B says  "Their Songs were of a legislative Cast and being drawn chiefly from the Fables or History of their own Country contained the essential Parts of their religious political and moral Systems"  This it seems you cannot  digest  and yet I fear you will be compelled to  swallow  it  First you acknowledge that the Songs of  Orpheus  and  Amphion  were of this  legislative Cast  that  "they employed them to perswade the Savages to live together sociably and without injuring each other and to worship the  Gods  P  "  So far we go together  "But as soon as the Conveniencies of Life began to abound they began to seek  Amusement  and then it is in the Light of pleasing and charming not sage or useful we find them considered  Ib  "  Now with all due Deference to the contrary Opinion and Practice of a learned Critic who lards his Sentences with Scraps of Greek may not a Work be at once  pleasing  and  instructive  Or to express myself in a Way more suitable to the Taste of certain Writers because less intelligible to Half their Readers may not the  Utile  and the  Dulce  be joined together As a full Proof that this was the Fact in the Poems of the ancient Greeks I need only refer to what Dr B has quoted from Plato  Dissert Sect v Art  There it appears at large that the Poems of their Bards were taught to their Children as the  Foundation  both of their  Opinions  and their  Manners  And the very Reason is assigned by Plato  why  this Method of  Instruction  was  used  "Because the  youthful  Mind is  not apt  to attend to  serious  Study therefore the  pleasing Vebicle  of  Song  is to be administered"  But you urge further  "that the Bard's Profession was not of that Dignity which Dr B ascribes to it"  "and as for his ranking the Bard next to  Kings  I can quote him two Passages where he is ranked with  Carpenters  P  "  You might have saved yourself the Trouble because Dr B himself has produced an Instance from another Country  Ireland  where the Bards had thought proper to rank themselves with  Thieves  and  Robbers  Dissert p  Yet in this very Country there had been a time when they were ranked with  Kings  and  Gods  Ib p  This shrewd Observation therefore arises only from your being unfairly carried off your Ground and obliged to talk on a Subject you are not acquainted with You suppose the Dignity of the Bard's Character to have been always  stationary  and  the same  whereas indeed it appears from Dr B's Work that it was generally  fluctuating  according to the accidental Changes in Civilization Arts and Manners  Again you say  "Had Homer's Work been  legislative  his Business would have been to deliver a  more perfect  and  improved  System in each Kind  P  "  How do you know that Has Homer himself told you so Upon what Authority do you make Homer  wiser  than he  was  and  wiser  than the  Times  had  made him  "He painted what he saw and believed says Dr B and painted truly the Fault lay in the Opinions and Manners of the Times In the Defects of an early and barbarous Legislation which had but halfcivilized Mankind  Dissert p  "  But now after having granted that Homer  did not  deliver a perfect and improved System of Doctrines you proceed like a profound Philosopher to prove that he  did  P  Your Argumentation on this Head I shall leave to the natural and common Sense of the Reader only adding this Remark that Homer's Fables were such a Picture of Life and Morals as  Plato  in a more refined Period thought proper to banish from his Republic lest they should  destroy all good Morals  Dr B has particularized some of the Chief of them which sufficiently justify  Plato's  Censure  Differt p    You next proceed to  Pindar  and here when I found you allowed that  "the poetic Songs  must  abound with Reflections on what was laudable or the contrary and with Pictures and Recommendations of what that Age and Nation reputed  Virtue"  and also that  "Fables built on the current Traditions at once struck the Imagination soothed the Vanity and excited the awful Respect of the Hearers  P  "  Now said I we are happily agreed But see the Vanity of human Hopes In the very next Line we are all broke to Pieces For it seems  "Pindar's intermixed Fables were so far from being  necessary to his Odes that in his first Ode he wrote without mixing Fables at all until an elder and more experienced Artist  Corinna  told him how  necessary they were  Ib  "  I durst hold an even Wager that this same  Corinna  was a sensible old Woman You see she was instructing a young Greek Divine in the Art of Preaching You tell us too that  "he followed her Advice"  Marry and with good Reason for it appears from Dr B's Dissertation as well as Corinna's Advice that Fables were regarded as an essential Part of the Performance  Dissert p    Your subsequent Remark is a downright Triumph For here you prove irrefragably that Dr B has called Pindar's Chair a Chair of  Gold  when in Reality it was only a Chair of  Iron  This is the second Error you have luckily hit by which you have more than made good the ancient Proverb that  "once a blind Man killed a Batt"  I cannot conceive how Dr B will bring himself off here unless he should perversely affirm that he speaks metaphorically and calls Pindar's a Chair of  Gold  in the same Manner as if he were to speak of the Chair in which certain modern Critics sit and write he would call it a Chair of  Lead  You go on  "The three Greek Tragedians says the Doctor are the last of this illustrious Catalogue of legislative Bards"    "Wo is me"  For  "in the most private Conversations I h  ve had they never gave me a Hint of their being Legislators or legislative Writers  P  "  No Wonder they never whispered the Secret to You who seem only to have been counting your Fingers and scanning Verses If they had whispered any thing to you I think I can guess what it would have been But you have set me an Example of Politeness and therefore notwithstanding all the friendly Freedoms I take with you I will not so much as hint what it was the Reeds whispered to  Midas  Yet you allow that  "they hold forth the leading Principles of the Greek Religion Polity and Morals and their Subjects are the Grecian Gods and Heroes  P  "  Here then you seem to carry about you more Truth than you are aware of You remember what grave Creature it was that formerly  carried the Mysteries  and yet was  never the wiser  But I make no illnatured Applications  But Solon you say does not seem to have  "had that high Idea of  the tragic Writers  as  useful Servants of the State  Ib  "  What Tragic Writers The three that Dr B speaks of Solon was dead long before they existed You shall take your Choice whether you will have  this set down to the Account of your  Learning  or your  Modesty  But  "Plutarch informs us that he expressed a great Dislike of their Art in the Practice of Thespis  P  "  True he did so And you tell us yourself in another Place what it was that Solon disliked It was  "the  new Circumstance  of  dramatic Representation  P  "  But this was not the Place for you to bring that Circumstance into View because it would have unmasked your Battery Solon was alarmed at a a Change in their poetic and musical Contests which hitherto had maintained their  simpler Form  and it was probably his high Idea of their  preestablished Utility  which induced him so severely to censure this  Innovation  Thus in the End this Affair of Solon and Thespis tends to confirm Dr B's Opinion rather than to confute it  But now you suddenly come round and become quite goodhumoured nay you are willing to lend Dr B a Lift and produce a Passage which tends to the Confirmation of his System  P  For you tell us  "Euripides himself is introduced affirming that the Reason why Poets are to be honoured is for their  Ingenuity salutary Admonitions  and  bettering  their FellowCitizens"  This is a Method of Confutation altogether new and very ingenious To confirm an Adversary's System by Proofs which he himself was ignorant  of and thus to demonstrate your Superiority  And now to close this Article in your own Manner I will also produce some additional Evidenees in Favour of Dr B's System and then I think we shall have  humbled  him sufficiently between us  The Doctor must know then for to be sure if he  had known  it he would have  said  it that in the ancient Times of Greece there was no other  Code  either  religious moral  or  political  but the Songs of their Bards If there was even one let Dr B produce it at his Peril These Songs or Poems then were indeed the great  Repository  of their  Principles  having no  real Revelation  or  Guide  from  Heaven  they took up with the  best they could find  and hence laid hold of the  Examples  of their fabulous  Gods  and  Heroes  as the Means of  fixing  the  fluctuating Principles  of their refpective Societies by a certain  Standard  however  defective  These Songs therefore may on this Foundation be properly stiled  legislative  because they actually stood in the Place of  Law  In farther Proof of this I will give Dr B two or three Authorities  "Hesiod and Homer says Herodotus were they who formed a Theogony for the Greeks giving Names to their Gods and fixing their Shapes or Figures  Herod Euterpe  "  As a  Consequence of this a respectable Modern tells us that  "the Writings of Homer became the  Standard  of  private Belief  and the  grand Directory  of  public Worship  Life of Homer p  "  Another learned Modern expresses himself in still stronger Terms For speaking of the ancient Greeks he affirms that  "Homer was their  Bible  and whatsoever was not  read therein  nor could be expressly  proved thereby  passed with them for  apocryphal  Div Leg of Moses Vol ii Part i p  "  Again He calls Homer and Hesiod  "the popular and only  authorized Books of Divinity  amongst the Greeks which assign the  Names  the  Attributes  and the  Form  to each God  Ib P  "  How it happened that these Fables which were swallowed in Times of Ignorance came to be established in a more knowing Age this learned Person likewise inform us  "The great Poets of Greece who had  most contributed  to  refine  the  public Taste  and  Manners  and were now grown into a Kind of  sacred Authority  had  sanctified  these silly Tales in their Writings which Time had now consigned to Immortality  lb Vol i Part ii P  "  Now all these Authorities every one of them tending to confirm his System Dr B hath ignorantly omitted and with  an apriori Notion  as  you elegantly stile it has pretended to be  wiser  than his Neighbours and gone about to prove with the most consummate Arrogance that it  must  be so and that from the  natural Progression  of  savage  Manners it  could not  be  otherwise  Having thus sufficiently humbled Dr B by bringing Arguments in his Favour which he knew nothing of we will now take Leave of this Article and proceed to Number  You preface your Criticisms on this Article by stiling them  "loose Observations  P  "  which we must take without much  "Order for you have not Time enough to methodize them"  And yet you have been a whole Year in throwing up your Crudities  Your first loose Observation on the th Article is this  "that although the Greeks regarded Music as a necessary Part of a liberal Education yet this only implies that it was an Accomplishment parallel to  Dancing  in present Times"  and in Proof of this you add that  "one modern Author intitles his Book on the Subject  the Rudiments of genteel Education  P  "  I could have furnished you with an Instance still more to your Purpose of a Dancing Master who writ a Treatise to prove that all the Vices of the present Age are owing to the  Neglect  of  Dancing  You go on  "Even the abstracted Locke and  Rousseau insist on it in their Treatises on EducationMay we not then conjecture the Cases were in some Measure alike  Ib  "  Truly we might conjecture as we pleased if the clear Evidence of Antiquity was not against us But  unluckily  again Dr B has proved from various ancient Authors that their Poems were the  Bible  of ancient Greece that these Poems were  sung  both in  public  and  private  and not only so but that their Children were taught to sing them to the Lyre as the very first Foundation of a virtuous Education  Dissert Sect v Art p c  He has proved that all this was done even before they learnt the  gymnastic Arts  And  these  if you had been properly conversant with ancient Manners were what you would have compared to modern  dancing  "Music  says Plato in a Passage quoted by Dr B relates to the  Mind  the  Gymnastic  to the Improvement of the  Body  Dissert Sect v Art p c  "  Well But  "Plato gives Notice that when he speaks of Music he includes the Subject Words or Song and by the Passage quoted from the Alcibiades it appears that this was not the popular Sense  P  "  Very true but very consistent with nay corroborative of all that Dr B has said He has observed that in the Time of Plato the  Separation  of Poetry and  Music had  commenced  Therefore it was proper and natural in Plato to explain himself  particularly  whenever he writ on this Subject and to inform his Readers that he spoke of Music in the  ancient  Sense and not in the  new  In his Alcibiades too he writ altogether according to Character For it was natural for Alcibiades a young Debauche to adopt the  new  Sense and for Socrates to put him in Mind of the  old  You next charge Dr B with writing in that Stile which  "is neither true nor false because he has not precisely fixed the Point which separates what he calls the  early  from the  late  Periods of Antiquity with regard to the Use of Music merely instrumental  y"  In this Point you not a little resemble an honest Lawyer at the Bar who was examining a Witness to a Fact The Witness said it happened between Nine and Ten in the Morning  "Was it at five Minutes or ten Minutes or a Quarter or Half or three Quarters after Nine"  said the honest Lawyer The Witness declaring he could not fix it to a few Minutes the Man of Logic turned about to the Jury and said  "Now Gentlemen I hope you are convinced that the Fellow talks in a Stile that is neither true nor false and that he knows nothing of the Matter"  But it seems you have at length discovered a Passage  "where Dr B speaks of a particular Period as an early one in which I will prove that a Separation had taken Place In a Passage from Strabo he speaks of something done after the Crissaean War as done in ancient Times  Ib  "  Dr B says no such Thing Pray examine his Book once again He says exactly what Strabo says but  unluckily  you understand neither Dr B nor Strabo That Author says  "that in ancient Times there was a Contest of Musicians"  and then he tells us farther  "that  this  was  established  at Delphi after the Crissaean War"  This Dr B translates literally from Strabo  Dissert p  who manifestly speaks of two distinct Periods but the first of these happening to lie beyond the Depth of your chronological Plummet you have learnedly jumbled them into one The ancient Times that Dr B after Strabo speaks of here were the Times of Apollo and his immediate FollowersBut of this you will hear more in due Time  However an early Period you are resolved to find though it make never so much against you  "If this should not satisfy the Doctor Pausanias in his History of the Pythian Contentions will tell him of one Eleutheres whom he mentions before Hesiod that gained the Prize for  mere  Execution  singing a Composition  not his own  He will tell him likewise that Hesiod did not play on the Harp so that there was a Separation of the Poet's and Musician's Character very early  P  "  Certain Stars there are which ray out  Light  and others I have read of in a profound Author which are said to ray out  Darkness  Of this latter Kind is the Paragraph before us which in this Sense may be stiled of the  first Magnitude  It requires no common Genius for Absurdity to crowd so much of it into so small a Compass as you have put into this short Paragraph The Point in Question is whether at this early Period there was an  allowed Separation  of  vocal  and  instrumental  Music in the public Contests Dr B affirms there was not and You bring this Passage to prove that there was Now whoever will look into Pausanias will find from this very Passage st that Eleutheres because he  could join  the  vocal  with  instrumental  Music was allowed to  sing  the Composition of  another  and Hesiod because  he could not join them  was not allowed to  sing his own  Pausanias Phoc  His not being able to join the  vocal  and  instrumental  Melody was regarded as such a Defect in this Poet as all his eminent Talents could not make up for Thus the very Passage which you bring in Confutation of Dr B's System when  fairly  and  honestly  given  to the Reader is a collateral Proof of the Truth of all he has said on the Subject  These Cavils arise manifestly from your  Power of Representation  The next to give You your  Due  is chiefly the Effect of pure Ignorance This relates to the second Instance which Dr B has alledged concerning the Power of ancient Music On this You observe  "that the Instrument in Question was the  Flute  both Quintilian and Iamblicus agree and how the most able Musician could  play  on this Instrument and  sing too  I do not well conceive except it could be proved that the  was that truly respectable and ancient Instrument the Scottish Bagpipe  P  "  Right sorry I am to lie under a Necessity of exposing the  Errors  of a  learned Critic  who piques himself on a Familiarity with all ancient AuthorsNow that the Instrument was the  or  Tibia  these Authors do both agree But did they agree to give  you  Leave to  translate  or  transform  it into a  Flute  A  Pipe  if you please But the Name and Fashion of a  Flute  are so  connected  in the Idea of a Modern that by this Transition you carry your Cause at once even before your Argument comes on Every  Flute  is indeed a  Pipe  but every  Pipe  is not a  Flute  And here lies the whole Mystery of the Matter For in the first Place you will see from the Passage  you have quoted from Pausanias that Echembrotus gained the Prize at the Pythian Games for  singing and playing on the Pipe  "There was the Song to the Harp as formerly there was the  Song to the Pipe  and there was the Pipe itself without Song Cephalon won the Prize among those who sung and played on the Harp Echembrotus among those who  sung  and  played on the Pipe  Sacadas among those who played on the Pipe only  Pausan in Phocicis  "  That the same Person  sung  and  played  on the  Pipe  is evident st from the Greek Name  which is  compound  and implies  both  dly from the Circumstance recorded of Hesiod that he was not admitted to the Pythian Contest because he could not both  sing  and  play  Farther it is evident from many Passages in  Theocritus  particularly from his th Eidyllium that the Shepherds both sung and played on their pastoral Pipe at the same Time In their Contention they are represented as accompanying their Song with the Pipe and to prepare us for this Union we are told in the Opening of the Pastoral that they were  "both skilled in playing on the Pipe both skilled in singing"  In  Virgil's  Eclogues this Union of the Shepherd's Pipe and Song is no less clearly alluded to  Sylvestrem tenui  Musam meditaris Avena  Formosam  resonare  doces  Amaryllida  Sylvas  Ecl i    In which Passage we have the  Subject  of his  Song  and the  Instrument  with which he  accompanies  it Again  An mihi cantando victus non redderet ille  Quem mea  Carminibus meruisset Fistula  Caprum  Ecl iii    Once more in the same Eclogue the Union is expressly declared  Cantando  tu illum aut unquam tibi  Fistula  Cera  Juncta fuit non tu in Triviis indocte solebas  Stridenti  miserum  Stipula  disperdere  Carmen  There is a Hint at it in the following Lines which however I give you chiefly for the Sake of a Picture it contains which perhaps you may know the next Time you look in your Glass  Aut hic ad veteres Fagos quum  Daphnidis Arcum  Fregisti Calamos  quae tu  perverse  Menalca  Et cum vidisti Puero donata  dolebas  Et si non aliquâ nocuisses mortuus esses  Again and if possible in still clearer Terms  O Mihi tum quam molliter Ossa quiescant  Vestra meos olim si  Fistula dicat Amores  Ecl x    I could transcribe several other Passages but shall conclude with the following in which the Shepherd invokes his  Pipe  his  Tibia  the very Instrument in Question to  accompany  his  Song  Incipe  Moenalios  mecum  mea  Tibia Versus  Ecl vii    As to the  Means  by which this Union was accomplished whether the Pipe was inflated from  above  or from  below  by  Wind  or by  Water  I shall leave to  Your  Investigation Is is a Subject too sublime for  Me  to attempt but every Way worthy of your exalted Genius On this therefore I shall commend you to your most profound Meditations guided by  Julius Pollux Bartholine  and other learned Men who have written  De Tibiis Veterum  In the mean Time please to accept if you will condescend so far a little Information from that poor ignorant Fellow  Isaac Vossius  "Si solas exceperis organicas Fistulas quae in Templis vulgo usurpantur vix ullas invenias alias quae Tibiarum dignae sunt Vocabulo  De Poem Cantu p  "    "Ascaul  seu  Utricularii Veterum  nihil omnino discrepant ab hodiernis Organariis  Ib p  "  According to this Author you see you are ignorant even of the Genealogy of a  Bagpipe  I am sorry to be under a Necessity of joining my Evidence to his against you For you must know the true Scotch Bagpipe still used in the Highlands is blown by the Mouth and That blown by the Bellows is a Theft from the Continent and probably as the Passage of Vossius implies delivered down from antient Times  Your next Attack on Dr B is upon the Subject of the  hymnal  or  lyric  Species And here you charge him with confounding two Things together which were essentially different You affirm that  "the  Hymn  was always written in  heroic Measure  and was the more ancient Form of the two that the  lyric Ode  was always written in  varied Measures  and was much later in its Production being no older than the Age of Thespis  P  "  You are so confident of the Propriety and Truth of this Distinction that you insult Dr B on his Ignorance and boast that by this Argument alone you have cut and torn his Cobweb Hypothesis  P    Of all the Men of Criticism I ever read You my Friend are the most unfortunate Had you been as well acquainted with ancient Authors as you are with your Prosody you would not have given Dr B such an Oportunity of exposing your Ignorance I will prevent your having the Mortification of being severely chastised and will lay on the Rod as gently as I can by referring you to a Passage in Dr B's  "History of the Rise and Progress of Poetry"  which I have now lying before me It is a Quotation from  Proclus  in which that Author tells us that  "in the  Pythian Nomos  or  Hymn  in Praise of  Apollo Terpander  who lived after the Age of  Homer  was the first who used the  hexameter  or  heroic  Verse and that  after Him  Phrynes  joined  This  to the  various  or  lyric Measure  which alone had been employed before  Terpandrum vero Nomon absolvisse apparet  cum ad  ibuisset heroicum Carmen  Phrynes vero novam Rationem commentus est Hexametrum enim cum soluto Carmine conjanxit  Proclus apud Photium  See the Passage quoted at large below p  "  Here then it appears that both what you call the  hymnal  and the  lyric Measure  were actually  employed together  and this many Ages before Thespis existed It appears farther to the total Annihilation of all your critical Pretensions that the  various  or  lyric Measure    "solutum Carmen"  was the more ancient of the two in this  Pythian Hymn  or  Song  so far from being the the Invention of the Age of  Thespis  it was from the earliest Times employed in the  Pythian Song  even as far back as the Times of  Apollo  Indeed it had been very strange had it been otherwise That  regular Hexameters  should have been  invented  before  irregular Rythms  were  used  could never have been supposed by any one whose Researches had gone beyond his  Prosody  But  there  the  Hexameter  standing  first  in  Rank  it was natural enough for a mere  Scanner  of  Verses  to imagine it was the  first  in the Order of  Nature  But how consistent you are with yourself in another Place I leave Yourself to determine You have told us before that in the rudest Periods of Society the Passions of Men naturally produce a  loose  Kind of  Verse  P c  the  solutum Carmen  and  now towards your Conclusion you tell us that the  loose  Kind of  Verse  the  solutum Carmen  had no Existence till about the Time of  Thespis  and that the  regular Hexameter  existed long before it You might as reasonably affirm that Savages built  Palaces  before  Caves  and  Cabins  had Exist"ence  You next proceed to deliver  Your  Sentiments concerning the Rise and Progress of Tragedy But as you confess that it is no more than  "what every School Boys knows  P  "  I shall save myself the Trouble of commenting on it This being indeed the vulgar Track of Criticism which Dr B has set himself to expose through the Course of his Work As therefore you offer no new Evidences but only retail the old ones  "which every School Boy knows"  I shall leave this Part of your Observations to shift for itself with this general Remark which Truth compels me to make that the Inconsistency and Disagreement of the several ancient Writers which you quote on this Subject is so glaring that in Fact they overturn each other's Authority and would induce any unprejudiced Man to go in Quest of some more general and rational Foundation for the Rise of Tragedy than the mere accidental Adventure of Thespis and his Route And this I perceive is one of the main Purposes  of Dr B's Inquiry with which if you please we will therefore go on  "To this you say I have a few Objections to urgest I would fain know if this be the natural Origin of Tragedy how it came to pass that in all Nations except Greece the more pathetic Drama is without a Chorus at all  r"  Critic be a little more cautious in your Assertions In three other Instances where Tragedy has arisen from Nature among the  Chinese  proper  Indians  and  Peruvians  Dr B has shewn that in the first there is a manifest Remnant of a Choir in the second a Choir actually exists and in the third that of  Peru  we know not whether there was a Choir or not  Disiert p c  So far is it from the Truth what you assert that  "in all Nations except Greece the more pathetic Drama is without a Chorus"  Again you object  "If the Rise and Progress of Tragedy be so extremely natural since  every Thing  that is  natural  is  universal  how came this Species of Poetry to arise or be cultivated in Athens only which that it was we have Plato's Word  P  "  My Remarks on this Observation arest Every thing that is  natural  is not  universal  because there are different Degrees of Civilization and Knowledge among Mankind which are attended with Accidents or Improvements  peculiar  and  natural  to  each  but  not universal  or  natural  to  all  Dramatic Representation was not cultivated at Athens only It has been cultivated in  China  in  India  and  Peru  though  "we have not  Plato's  Word for it"  The Degree of Civilization and the concomitant Powers of the Mind may be so weak among many Nations as never to produce the dramatic Form which was the Case among some of the Tribes of ancient  Greece  as likewise of ancient  Gaul Britain  and other Countries The Progress of Poetry up to the dramatic Form may be checked by a Variety of Accidents either  internal  or  external  By Accidents  internal  as among the  Egyptians  where the first rude Forms of Poem and Melody were established by Law which prevented all  Change  that is either  Improvement  or  Corruption  And again as among the  Hebrews  where the Purity of Religion prevented their Poetry from assuming the dramatic FormBy Accidents  external  as where War Conquest a Subversion of Religion or Government destroyed that original System of Pagan Principles on which natural Tragedy is built And if by any of these the original Form of Tragedy was once changed it could not probably be renewed by the mere Force of NatureI have been the more particular on this Article because the Objection though ignorantly made by You gave Room for a farther Opening of the main Subject  But dly you object that  "unfortunately it is declared as fully as any thing can or need be that the  ancient  Tragedy consisted of a  Chorus alone  and without an Actor  P  "  I suppose you mean it was so at  Athens  but does it therefore follow that it wore the same Form every where else Dr B has proved in a Passage which must soon rise up in Judgment against you that even in the  earliest  Celebration of the  Pythian  Games at  Delphi  there was a  narrative  if not a  dramatic Episode  divided into  five Acts  From this Passage it farther appears that long before the Time of  Thespis  or even of  Homer  this Episode was performed by a  single Person  and not by the  Choir  See Hist of Poetry p c The Passage is quoted below p  Now if this existed at  Delphi  even  soon after  the  Age  of  Apollo  what is it to the Purpose to say that it did not exist at  Athens  Dr B is investigating the Rise of Tragedy from Nature and finds its first rude Form existing  at Delphi  in or about  the Time of Apollo  and to disprove This  you  most philosophically endeavour to make it out that it did not appear  at Athens  till  many Ages after  This is another of your new Modes of Confutation  Your th Objection is as follows  "It will likewise follow from the Doctor's System that the Choral Part would be of Course only an Appendage to the Episode and the Chorus  would be but a supposed Spectator of the Action or a subordinate Personagein it But that the contrary does happen in striking Instances is well known to those whose Ideas of Greek Tragedy are taken from Eschylus Euripides and Sophocles not merely from Dissertations Bibliotheca's and Institutiones Poeticae  P  "  Again  "The Chorus in several ancient Tragedies are themselves principal Personages and deeply interestedin two Eumenides and Iketides they are the leading Personages c  P  In Reply to this I shall give you the following Paragraph from Dr B's History of Poetry  "By thus tracing the tragic  Choir  to its true Foundation the  savage SongFeast  we are now inabled to give a clear and easy Solution to a Difficulty which hath embarrassed all the Critics It hath been held a Circumstance unaccountable or absurd that the  Choir  in several of the ancient  Greek Tragedies  should be made  privy  to some of the most  atrocious Designs  and yet should not  reveal  them though its  Character  was confessedly  moral  This indeed on the common Supposition that the  Choir originally  made an essential Part of the  dramatic Persons  is a thorough Absurdity But in Reality it appears in the  savage SongFeast  that they who  recite  or  represent  the  Action  are a  Body  quite distinct from the  Choir  and that the  Choir  in its  original  State is indeed the  Audience  who surround the  Narrator  or  Actor  and  answer  him at every  Pause  with Shouts of  Triumph Approbation  or  Dislike  This being so how could they the  Choir  or  Audience  properly  reveal  any secret Designs either good or badTo whom should they  reveal  them To each otherThis was needless because they knew them alreadyMust they then reveal them to the  Actors  of the Drama This could only have confounded the Representation and destroyed the Plot It would have been precisely on a Level with the Practice of an honest Country Lad who was present at the Representation of OTHELLO When he foresaw that IAGO's Treachery was likely to end tragically for poor DESDEMONA he called aloud to OTHELLO  Sir the Rascal lies he stole the Handkerchief himself  This naturally leads to the Elucidation of another Circumstance In the Beginning of the Time of ESCHYLUS the  Choir  consisted of no less than  fifty  Persons Afterwards the Number was lessened to  fifteen  How came it to pass that in the more barbarous Periods the Number should be so much greater Manifestly on the Principles here given because  that  rude Age bordered on the  savage  Times when the  whole Audience  had  sympathized  with the  narrative Actor  and became as  one general Choir  "This Solution naturally clears up another Circumstance which is unaccountable on the common System If the  Choir  were  originally  a Part of the  dramatic Actors  why were they placed in a  Balcony  or  Gallery separate  from the  Stage  No good Reason can be assigned But if we suppose them to have been  originally  the  Spectators  of the  Drama  we see they were in their  natural  and  proper Situation  "But to this it may be objected "that the  Choir  sometimes maintains a  Dialogue  with the  Actor  in the  Greek  Tragedies and ought therefore to be regarded as a  dramatic Person"  To this which hath been observed above it is reply'd that though the  Choir  sometimes  speaks  yet this is only by its  Leader  and then only  occasionally  and from  Necessity  to fill the  Place of another Actor  when no more than one or two are upon the Stage For this Reason ESCHYLUS uses the Expedient oftener than his Successors because his dramatic Persons were  fewer  But though the  Choir  sometimes speak by their  Leader  yet they never take Part in the  Action  as sufficiently appears by their not revealing the Secrets of it  "It may be urged again that in the  Eumenides  and  Iketides  of ESCHYLUS the  Choir  is certainly to be considered as a  dramatic Person  because they are indeed the  chief Actors  in  the Drama True they are so but though this Objection looks formidable yet on a deeper Consideration the Bugbear will vanishESCHYLUS was desirous to represent an Action of  fifty Furies  and another of  fifty Da  aids  at a Time when only  two dramatic Persons  were allowed by Custom to come on the Stage together What Expedient could he use Why surely no other than That which we find he  hath  used To throw these  numerous Bodies  into the Form of a Choir and thus he gained them Admittance on the StageTo speak with Precision therefore we ought to say that the Action of these two Tragedies passeth  without a Choir  that is without any supposed  Spectators  who  take no Part in it  Hist of Poetry p c  "  I hope that in your  next Edition  you will prove this strange Paragraph to be a Heap of Nonsense and Absurdity or perswade the Reader by all Means if you can that Dr B picked it out of some Dissertation Bibliotheca or Institutio Poetica  I must now give you a gentle Rebuke for rashly charging Dr B either with  Ignorance  or  Hypocrisy  for saying that  "we are assured on the Authority of other Writers that a Report prevailed in Greece that certain Poets had  in ancient Times  contended at the Tomb of  Theseus"  This you affirm happened at a late Period  which late Period by the Way Dr B had mentioned in his Dissertation  P  when  Sophocles  won the Prize from  Eschylus  and then you leave it to Dr B's Choice whether he will submit to the Charge of  Ignorance  or  Dissimulation  Now I perceive that in the History of Poetry he has cleared himself of  both  This says Dr B is asserted by SCALIGER in the clearest Terms and is alledged by him as a Proof of the Existence of Tragedy before the Age of THESPIS Tragediam vero esse Rem antiquam constat ex Historia ad THESEI namque Sepulchrum certasse Tragicos legimus" De Poet l i c On what Authority he says this I know not If any ancient Author hath asserted it this Contest must have been held at the Place where the Remains of THESEUS had been interred before they were brought to ATHENS by CIMON for that Event happened in the Time of SOPHOCLES"    and left the Public to fix upon  You  what  Name  they please  What that Name is  you may guess from the next Remark I am now compelled to make For as a Reader of some Curiosity observed to me  "after the Critic had charged Dr B in his Text with  Dishonesty  or  Ignorance  in a  sly Corner  of a  Note  which he supposed many Readers would pass over he confesses that  his Charge  is  groundless  and says  a Friend then with me told me he feared I was mistaken  This Charge then continued the Gentleman though at first it  might possibly  have been  written  by  Mistake  yet was  certainly persisted in  and  printed  in  Hypocrisy  and  Malice  because both the Charge  against Dr B and the  Confession  of its  Falshood  are printed on  the same Page  and therefore nothing is more certain than that he might have struck out this  Slander  if he pleased"  You proceed  "But now follows a Passage which I do look upon to be the Masterpiece of Dr B's whole Work where I know not which most to admire the Learning Exactness Fidelity or Judgment  P  "  You then proceed to translate at large a Passage from  Strabo  which Dr B hath refered to and in Part transcribed This Passage relates to the  Pythian Nomos  or  Song  and Dr B having alledged it to prove that the rude Form of Tragedy existed many Ages before Thespis you affirm on the contrary that Dr B's Argument is a Heap of Ignorance Blunder and Misrepresentation You endeavour to perswade the Reader st That this  Pythian Nomos Hymn  or  Song  did not exist till  after  the  Crissaean  War which was about the Time of  Thespis  dly That Dr B asserts or supposes this  Crissaean  War to have been  before  the Time of  Homer  dly That the musical Contest alluded to by  Strabo  was merely  instrumental  thly That the Nature of this musical Contest was not well understood and was only explained in a  particular Manner  by one who lived three hundred Years after  P c  On this Subject I presume the following Paragraph may give you entire Satisfaction  "But a still stronger Evidence presents itself For even the very  Substance  and  Form  of one of these rude Outlines of  savage Tragedy  remains in several respectable Authors of Antiquity I mean in their Accounts of the Celebration of the  Pythian Games  These were first celebrated in the times of APOLLO himself and contained a mimetic Narration by  poetic Song Melody  and  Dance  of his Victory over the  Python  This Representation was called the  Pythian Nomos  and underwent the following Changes or Improvements through the several successive Periods of Antiquity"  "The Poem called  Nomos  had APOLLO for its Subject and took its Name from  Him  For APOLLO was named  Nomimos  because in ancient Times when the whole  Choir  used to sing the  Nomos  to the  Pipe  or  Lyre  CHRYSOTHEMIS the  Cretan  was the first who clad in a splendid Robe and playing on the Harp sung the Nomos  alone  in  Imitation  of APOLLO'S Victory and being much applauded  this Form  of the Contest  remained to AfterAges  Certamen apud Delphos antiquitus fuit Citharoedorum Paeanem in Laudem Dei canentium  Strabo  l ix  Nomos quidem in Apollinem  conscriptus  a quo appellationem sumpsit Apollo enim  nomimos  appellatus est quia  Veteribus Choros constituentibus  ad Tibiam vel Lyram  Nomon canentibus

Proclus apud Photium Bibl Ed Hoesch  p  "  What this  Form  was  we learn from the following Accounts  The Poem was divided into  five Parts  or  Acts  The first contained the  Preparation  for the Fight the second the Challenge the third exhibited the Fight itself the fourth the  Victory  of APOLLO the fifth contained the  Triumph  of the God who  danced  after his Victory  Pythici vero nomi qui Tibia canitur partes quinque sunt Rudimentum Provocatio Iambicum Spondeum Ovatio Representatio autem est Modus quidem Pugnae Apollinis contra DraconemEt in ipso Experimento Locum circumspicit num Pugnae conveniens sitIn Provocatione vero provocat DraconemSed in Iambico pugnatSpondeum vero Dei Victoriam representat et in Ovatione Deus ad victorialia Carmina saltat  Jul Pollux O    l iv c      "It appears that TERPANDER improved the  Nomos  by adding the  heroic Measure  After Him ARION inlarged it greatly being both a  Poet  and a  Performer  on the  Harp  PHRYNES introduced a  new Circumstance  for he joined the  Hexameter  with the  various Measure  Terpandrum vero Nomon absolvisse apparet cum adhibuisset heroicum Carmen Post Arion Methymnaeus non parum auxit Poeta ipse Citharaedus Phrynes vero Mitylenaeus novam Rationem commentus est Hexametrum enim cum soluto Carmine conjunxit  Proclus apud Photium  ib  "  In a later  Period this poetic and musical Representation was  "formally established at DELPHI after the  Crissaean  War  Institutum a Delphis  post Crissaeum Bellum  "  Afterwards the Amphictyons added a Contest of  Music merely instrumental  "Adjecerunt autem Citharoedis Tibicines et qui Cithara luderent  sine cantu  modularenturque Carmen quod Nomos five Modus Pythius dicebatur"  Strabo  l ix  but preserved what had been practised in former Times "There was the  Song  to the  Harp  as  formerly  there was the  Song  to the  Tibia  or  Pipe  and there was the Pipe itself  without Song  "Certamina instituerunt Amphictyones Cantus ad Citharam ut pridem Cantus item ad Tibiam ipsarum etiam per se Tibiarum"  Pausanias in Phocicis  " This Addition of Music  merely instrumental  was likewise  imitative  being designed as a  mimetic Description  by  mere Melody  of the Battle between APOLLO and the  Python  It consisted likewise of five Parts corresponding with those of the ancient Song  "Quinque sunt ejus Partes anacrusis ampeira katakeleusmos Iambi Dactyli syringes seu Fistulae sibilae"  Strabo  ib  "TIMOSTHENES in the Time of the second  Ptolomy  writ a Poem descriptive and explanatory of this musical Contention According to this Author the Subject was the Victory of APOLLO over the Serpent The first Part was the Prelude to the Battle the second was the  Beginning of the Engagement the third was the Battle itself the fourth was the Paean or Triumph on the Victory the fifth was an Imitation of the Agonies and Hissing of the dying Serpent  Carmen composuit Timosthenes secundi Ptolemaei Claffr PraefectusVult autum Apollinis adversus Draconem Certamen celebrari eo Carmine anacrusin significare Praeludium ampeiran Certaminis Initium katakeleusmon ipsam Pugnam Iambum Dactylum Paeanem qui Victoriae accinitur talibus Modis five Rythmis quorum Hymnus quidem proprius est Iambus autem  desunt quaedam  iambizare Fistulas autem Mortem imitatas Serpentis Vitam cum Sibilis quibusdam finientis  Strabo  ibThese Passages are given in the Latin Translations which though not always elegant are sufficiently correct that a greater Number of Readers may be inabled to judge of the Evidence  "  Now though these ancient Authors differ from each other in two or three trifling Circumstances yet as to every thing  essential  they  perfectly agree  And from their concurrent Evidence we have clear Proof of the following Facts That the immediate Followers of APOLLO began these  poetic  and  musical  Contests That till CHRYSOTHEMIS appeared in or near the Time of APOLLO there subsisted only a  Choir  That  He  first sung the  Episode  single and alone That his Song was a  mimetic Narration  or  Imitation  of APOLLO's Victory That the  Form  which He gave to This  continued  through succeeding Times That  this Poem was divided into  five Parts  or  Acts  containing a  progressive Description  and  Imitation  of the Battle and Victory And lastly that  Songs  of  Triumph Exultation Sarcasm  and  Contempt  together with a  correspondent Dance  accompanied the  narrative Episode  "SCALIGER is of Opinion that the  Dance  was  mimetic  of the  whole Narration  or  Action  and divided into the same Number of  Acts  At vero seorsum Saltatio  haud illi absimilis  edebatur in  tot  m Actus  aeque distributa"  Poet l i c  If indeed this was added it amounts to a strict  dramatic Representation  For as the same learned Critic says elsewhere "Sane Ludi sunt tacitae Fabulae Fabulae vero Ludi loquentes"  lb c xxii  But as this Circumstance is not so clearly delivered as the rest I lay no Stress on it"    Thus in this most ancient  Pythian Song  as delivered down from the Times of APOLLO himself and performed and augmented through the succeeding Periods of ancient GREECE we have the very  Substance  and  Form  of a first rude Essay towards Tragedy divided into  five Acts  and compounded of  poetic Narration imitative Music Dance  and  Choral Song  And it is worthy of singular Observation that through this whole representative Scene of APOLLO  singing dancing  and  praising his own Exploits  the  ancient Greek Historians  transport us as it were into the Wilds of  modern America  and present to us the  genuine Picture  of a  savage Chieftain  "See the Description of the savage Song Feast from LAFITAU Sect ii"    "It appears therefore that Tragedy had a much earlier and deeper Foundation in ancient GREECE than the accidental Adventure of THESPIS and his Route That it arose from  Nature  and an unforced  Union  and  Progression  of  Melody Dance  and poetic  Song  History of Poetry p c  "  You see here that your whole critical Fabric is annihilated at a Blow For st it appears on the clearest Evidence that this Pythian Song was performed  in ancient Times  even as  ancient  as those of  Apollo  himself dly It appears that when you charge Dr B with Ignorance in supposing the  Crissaean  War to have been before the Time of  Homer  your Objection is unhappily founded on your own Ignorance on your not understanding  Strabo  nor Dr B who both speak of two different Periods which you have profoundly jumbled into one dly It appears that this musical Contest was not merely instrumental but contained a  mimetic Song  performed by a  single Person  in  Imitation  of  Apollo's  Victory and thly we are at no Loss for the  essential  Parts of it but know certainly that it contained a progressive Description of  Apollo's Battle  and  Victory  over the  Python  And now let me cordially advise you for the future to be less insolent in a State of imagined Security and Conquest lest your own Expressions  should be retorted upon youThus  "a few such Mistakes as Mrhere presents you in a Bunch would serve a Man of ordinary Genius to spread through a whole Book"    "Is it not a fine Thing for a Man to set up for an Instructor of Mankind who is ignorant of what his commonest Readers know  P  "  And other modest Expressions scattered through your Work of the same Nature  The same  Spirit  still impels you to proceed though I look upon you  now  as little more than the  Ghost  of a  departed Critic  Dr B having endeavoured to prove by a Variety of Arguments that  Eschylus  was an  original  Writer and not a mere  Imitator  of  Homer  you say you can oppose  "the Testimony of  Eschylus  himself of whom it was a common and wellknown Saying as  Athenoeus  tells us that his Pieces were small Scraps or Morsels of the magnificent Entertainment of  Homer  P  "  I could not but smile at your Simile of the  FaggotBinder  and thought you had got a small Advantage over Dr B till I looked into the  "History of Poetry where I found the following Note It is said indeed of ESCHYLUS that he called his Tragedies no more than Fragments of the magnificent Entertainment given by HOMER"  Now this Expression  "being only  metaphorical  we ought to interpret  it in that Sense only to which a Comparison of their Writings leads us And as it appears that there is no Resemblance between them either in the  particular Subjects  or in the  Manner  of treating them the only rational Interpretation that can be given seems to be this "that the Subjects of his Tragedies were only small  Morsels  or  Fragments  of the  Grecian Story  whereas HOMER had given a  general System  of their fabulous History both in a more  extensive  and a more  connected  Manner"  You accuse Dr B of treating the Author of  Elfrida  and  Caractacus  with  Indignity  P  Now what has that Author to do in the present Debate Are  You  in any Respect concerned for the  Reception  or  Credit  of  his  Works Or after all is there not  some other  Author on whose Account you are so touched to the Quick though you are too prudent to mention or even to hint at him  But if Dr B has treated the Author of  Elfrida  with Indignity how do  you  know that  that  Author had not first deserved it by treating  himself  with  Indignity  I could say more for I have heard more but it is neither generous nor worth while to disturb the Ashes of the  Dead  You go on  "The Union of Music with Tragedy he says was never accounted for to which I add nor is it yet But of that you will  hear another Time  P  "  Come on then with your Proofs for of your Affirmations we have had enough    "Concerning his Comment on  Aristotle's  Definition of Tragedy you add I have more to say than You or I have at present Time for  Ib  "  My learned Friend find a little Time if you can I am satisfyed that  Your  Comment will be a great Curiosity  This Article is of Consequence to the main Question and therefore I must be particular in my RemarksYou say  "On his Account of the Masque and Buskin which he says arose from the Custom of selecting the tallest and strongest Men for their Chiefs I have to observe that the Actions of their Tragedies are almost universally taken from a Period in which their Kingdoms were hereditary and in which Men succeeded not by Election for Bulk or any thing else but by Birth and Descent  P  "  Here you not only  affirm  but you  reason  I wish I could say like a  Man  and not like a  Child  What is it to the Purpose whence the Subjects of the more  modern  Tragedies of  Eschylus Sophocles  and  Euripides  were taken To satisfy Dr B in this Point you must tell him what were the Subjects of all those  fifteen Tragedians  who were prior to the Age of  Thespis  Nay I question whether he will be content with this  for we have found him very exorbitant in his Claims but will insist upon your telling him what were the Subjects of all the oldest irregular savage Bards who existed as early or perhaps even more early than  Apollo  himself This will carry us you see up to the Period of savage Life in which we must allow I am afraid that  "the tallest and strongest Men are commonly selected as Chiefs"  But then you will say  "that the Masque was the Invention of a later Age even a later than  Thespis  himself"  In  Attica possibly  it might be so But though  Eschylus  is said by some to have been the Inventor of the  Masque  yet  Aristotle  fairly confesses that its  Origin  is absolutely  unknown  and  Clemens Alexandrinus  affirms that it was in Use even in the  Times  of  Orpheus  These Circumstances are not a little favourable to Dr B's System and seem to imply that dramatic Representation had existed in  Greece  though not perhaps at  Athens  even as long ago as the Age of  Orpheus  And it is beyond all Doubt that a very little before the Age of  Orpheus  the Time was when  "the Savages elected the tallest and strongest Men for Chiefs"  cYou now declare you are tired with the Task of  "combating Chimeras  P  "  And truly so am IWe will therefore hasten to a  Conclusion as fast as possible Some few scattered Observations only now remain  You charge Dr B with an Error in  "insisting that the last Institution of the Pythian Games was no more than a Separation of the Gymnastic Exercises from the Musical whereas the Words of Strabo whom he quotes are as clear as possible that only the Musical subsisted before and that the Gymnastic and Equestrian were then added to them  P  "  For Truth's and Decency's Sake do not give Dr B so many repeated Occasions of calling your Sincerity in Question Who would not believe from the Tenor of this Passage but that Dr B in his Quotation from  Strabo  had some how or other disguised this Circumstance of the Addition of the gymnastic and equestrian Exercises Yet on looking into the Passage in Dr B's Dissertation I find it quoted in the  very same Words  Indeed the Doctor questions the strict  Propriety  of  Strabo's  saying  "that the  gymnastic  Exercises were  added"  because he conceives they were there  before  making a Part of the  ancient Musical  Exercises under the Denomination of the  Dance  Diss p  "  This he has attempted to prove by some very plausible Arguments I must confess not one of which  you  have  disproved  However what you cannot  disprove  you can  misrepresent  which with some Readers may do as well  Again you charge him with  "interpreting as an Account of the Effect of Music on Manners what Plato means only as an Illustration of the ill Effects of a licentious democratic Spirit c  P  "  On the contrary Dr B has made it appear by Passages quoted from  Plato  himself that  Plato's  Argument included  both  these Causes  Diss Sect vi Art    Another Censure is on  "his supposing that the Writings of  Archilochus  were banished from  Sparta  on Account of their  sarcastic Turn  which was indeed on Account of their  Obscenity  P  "  As the Passage in Dr B is short I will give it entire that every one may judge for himself  "The Spartans ordered the Writings of  Archilochus  to be banished from their City because they thought the Perusal of them was  dangerous  to the  Purity  of  Manners  Diss Sect vii Art  "  In a correspondent Article he explains himself still more particularly  "because nothing could be more dangerous to a Commonwealth established on  Severity  of  Manners  than the  unbounded Licentiousness  of  Sentiment  and  Speech  which this the  old  Comedy must  tend  to  produce  Ib  "  Seriously I am at a Loss how to express myself properly on this Occasion and therefore shall briefly set down this as another Instance of  your Modesty  I shall now conclude all with a most shining Proof of your being eminently possessed of this great Virtue After very notably squabbling with Dr B about a dubious Passage in Xenophon and quarrelling him for not rendering it exactly as You would have him you charge him with falsely translating the Word  the better to serve his Purpose You affirm that this Word does not imply  "good  and  virtuous  Men"  but  "only the  rich  or  powerful  the  better Sort  as we say  P  "  Now my most ingenuous Friend turn back to the th and th Pages of your own Work and you will see a Gorgon's Head which if you are not totally melted into Modesty will turn you into Stone Here we find this very Word translated by your good Self in that very Sense in which Dr B had translated it  "The Reason say You why Poets are to be honoured is  for their Admonitions and  bettering  their FellowCitizens"  Reader  "you may stare"  but the Assertion lies open to broad Day Light in his th and th Pages  "Wits  have  short  Memories says  Pope  and  Dunces none"  But  one Class  of Men there is who all the World agree either  have  or  ought to have  GOOD MEMORIES  Two or three other Paragraphs there are on which I might very reasonably bestow a farther  Panegyric But this last contains so delicate a Picture of your  amiable Mind  and of the  generous Motives  that set you to work to criticize Dr B that I am unwilling to draw off the Reader from the Contemplation of so  sweet  a Pourtrait  Thus through the Course of my Remarks you see I have been very  free  but very  friendly  I cannot help congratulating you on your good Fortune in falling into the Hands of one who has made great Allowances for your Imperfections and even passes over many inferior Blots which a censorious Critic would have hit  Of this Kind is a slight Mistake p in your saying the  "Oracle of  Delphos  instead of the "Oracle of  Delphos"  You may knock down your Adversary with your critical Dungfork if you please but who gave you Leave without Provocation to break poor  Priscian's  Head What would  You  say of Dr B's Knowledge in Grammar should he affirm that  "Aristotelem  was not so profound a Reasoner nor  Longinum  so sublime a Critic as  You"  Yet this he might have said with the same ProprietyI mean so far as Grammar is concerned  The more so because you openly profess to treat Dr B's  Errors  with  Severity  P  whereas mere  Errors  have ever been supposed to merit  Indulgence  Add to this that your Bitterness to a Man who has put his  Name  to his Work while You  conceal Yours  has in the Opinion of some People the Air of dishonest Cowardice and what they will needs call  stabbing in the Dark  You conclude with a solemn Charge against Dr B of his being  "flagrantly guilty of misquoting Authors"  I wish you had better maintained this heavy Charge I am bold to say that the Instances you have produced have turned out to the Confirmation of  his  System and little to  your  Honour Give me leave to put you in Mind of a Passage in a certain Book which relates to a Man's pulling a  Mote  out of his  Brother's  Eye while he sees not the  Beam  that is in his  own  I will now conclude with a Hint of Advice to you in which I am sure I shall  deserve  your Thanks whether I  obtain  them or  not  I mean only to exhort you for the future to stick to that Species of Criticism for which you are apparently qualified In every Instance where you attack the larger Parts of Dr B's System my Regard to Truth obliges me to say that you fail most miserably But when you get hold of him upon a  minute  Article you are sure to pinch him to the Bone Thus on the  wide  Subject of the old  Greek Religion  the  Origin  of  poetic Numbers  the Genius of  savage Manners  the  Rise  and  Progressions  of  Poetry  consequent on these with several other large and extensive Articles of Inquiry you are totally off your Ground But to make Amends for this small Defect you are amply revenged by detecting him in the important Blunder  of calling  Herophile  by the Name of  Phenomoë  stiling Pindar's Chair a Chair of  Gold  when it was only of  Iron  And in the painful and laborious Article of  Prosody  or  scanning Verses Isaac Vossius  himself is forced to yield to you  Now as you observe in the Beginning of your Work  "Multi multa possunt sed nemo omnia"  Nobody can have at once the  microscopic  and the  telescopic  Eye Therefore improve the Talent which Nature has given you If you cannot  see  cultivate that Kind of Vision which is  that is if you cannot comprehend  large  and  distant  Objects apply yourself diligently to the  nearathand  or  purblind  Criticism  With this Advice I shall take my Leave of you esteeming it a sufficient Waste of Time and Labour thus for once to have  unmasqued  the  empty Parade  of a trifling and disingenuous Caviler  Personam Tragicam forte Vulpes viderat  O  quanta Species  inquit  cerebrum non habet  THE END  Fig  The Scale of  V  th•  c B♭♭ E♭ C♭ G♭ D♭
