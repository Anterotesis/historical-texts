 The STRANGERS AT HOME A Comic Opera In Three Acts As performed at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane  tableau  LONDON  Printed for Harrison C  o  N  o  Paternoster Row MDCCLXXXVI  TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES  SIR  IT being peculiarly the business of a dramatic writer to select those popular topics upon which he is assured of having the public voice with him it might na∣turally be expected that after receiving Your ROYAL HIGHNESS's gracious per∣mission to lay this Dramatic Essay at Your feet I should eagerly have availed myself of the opportunity thus given me of ex∣patiating on those manners talents and virtues which constitute so general a theme of admiration But minds truly  conscious of meriting praise are ever re∣served and delicate in accepting it and perhaps Your ROYAL HIGHNESS will not suffer a sincere acknowledgment of merit because the panegyric of Princes has been too often stained with adulation  Restrained by this consideration I must content myself with offering my humble acknowledgments for the honour confer∣red on me in the countenance of my fee∣ble endeavours to cultivate an elegant art which so eminently boasts the protection of Your ROYAL HIGHNESS  I am with the most profound respect Your ROYAL HIGHNESS's Most obedient And most devoted servant JAMES COBB  LONDON  FEB  ADVERTISEMENT  THE Author of the STRANGERS AT HOME would think himself guilty of great injustice if at a moment when the Piece is so highly honoured by the public approbation he should forget how much of that approbation he owes to the abilities of the Performers all of whom so kindly interested themselves in its suc∣cess To Mr KING he has peculiar obligations for the care and attention with which he superintended the rehearsals of the Opera and to that Gentleman's judi∣cious criticisms he is likewise highly indebted Al∣though it might be superfluous for the Author to add his praises to those which the public have so liberally and deservedly bestowed on Mr LINLEY's Music he cannot but congratulate himself on having had the as∣sistance of so able a Master  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Aldobrand  Mr KING  Regnalto  Mr WILLIAMES  Octavio  Mr DIGNUM  Montano

☞ The Passages marked with inverted Commas are omitted in the Representation  THE Strangers at Home A COMIC OPERA  ACT I  SCENE a Street in FLORENCE  VIOLA and ALICE in a Balcony belonging to REGNALTO's House  A Procession of Captives redeemed from Slavery cross the Stage among them are REGNALTO and LAURENCE  CHORUS  WELCOME once more our native land  Where smiling Freedom's bounteous hand  Life's fading picture bids to glow  With tints she can alone bestow  'Tis Liberty inspires the lay  To hail our second natal day  Hail Goddess bright by all ador'd  By thee to more than life restor'd  ALICE  What a glorious procession Ma'am  VIOLA  Glorious indeed Alice to see so many of our countrymen redeemed from foreign slavery and all by the munificence of the young and noble Octavio  ALICE  Ah Madam I fancy this same Signor Octavio has enslaved you at the very moment when he was giving others their liberty  VIOLA  Oh that my long lost brother were but among these ran∣som'd captives  ALICE  And oh that my long lost husband were among them too Lord Ma'am talk of a brotherI'm sure when I was of your age I should have thought one husband worth twenty brothers  VIOLA  HarkI hear the music againLet us listen  Some of the Crowd come forward with Flasks of Wine they ap∣pear to congratulate the Captives who drink with them and join in the following Catch  CATCH  Come come drink away boys let our glasses keep time  To the tune of the bells that so merrily chime  Ding dong ding dong bellthat so merrily chime  From slavery freed we'll forget all our pains  At the tyrant we'll laugh while he rattles his chains  We'll laugh at his chains  Thus music and drinking all sorrow shall drown  Then my boys let us take off our glasses  Huzza huzza ev'ry bumper shall crown  ALDOBRAND  Without  Viola  ALICE  There is that croaking old raven your guardian  ALDOBRAND  Viola my dear where are you  ALICE  Don't answer him Ma'am  VIOLA  Look Alice there are two men whose eyes seem rivetted upon us  ALICE  WhereEhWhy sureYesNoYes it is my poor husband It is Laurence  ALDOBRAND  Without  Alice why Alice  ALICE  Coming Sir presently  REGNALTO and LAURENCE come forward  LAURENCE  Yes there is Alice sure enough My rib my spouse and as plump as ever She has not pined much after me I see  REGNALTO  It is my sister my Viola  ALDOBRAND  Without  ViolaAlicewhere are you  ALICE  Coming SirPlague take the old curmudgeon You must go to him Ma'am  REGNALTO  She looks on me but does not know me  Exeunt VIOLA and ALICE from the Balcony  And see they vanish like spirits at the dawn of day  LAURENCE  Spirits I am sure then they are choice spirits Heaven bless you Sir they are flesh and blood I'll warrant at least I can answer for AliceBut I think I scent the supper Oh for a fat capon and a bottle of good wineI'll knock at the door  REGNALTO  By no means you know my suspicions of Aldobrand with whom I left the charge of my sister and my house I am re∣solved to remain concealed till I can satisfy those suspicions  LAURENCE  But may'nt I satisfy my hunger in the mean while Sir  REGNALTO  Have a little patience  LAURENCE  Ah Sir patience is a bad physician he has worn me to a skeleton already If I don't change my doctor he'll soon make a dreadful change in me But here comes the Algerine cap∣tain who brought us over  Enter MONTANO  REGNALTO  Noble Ibrahim I thank Heaven that I am at length arrived where I may be enabled properly to acknowledge that benevo∣lence whose rays illumined our night of slavery Nay start not are you surprized to find gratitude among the Christian virtues  MONTANO  No my generous friend wide as the sun darts his beams he finds that precious jewel which decks alike the Turban and the Cross  REGNALTO  Then let me express the grateful sentiments I feel  MONTANO  It will be sufficient that you suffer me to remain unknown and unnoticed in this city  Exit MONTANO  REGNALTO  We must hasten to offer our respects to the generous Oc∣tavio  LAURENCE  I had much rather offer my respects to a wellcovered table we shall be in better spirits after supper my gratitude will grow stronger as my stomach gets fuller  REGNALTO  Away no trifling We must pay our compliments where they are due  Exit  LAURENCE  Well Sir if it must be so I'll follow you presently though mine I fear will be but empty complimentsHa here comes  our fellowcaptive Firelock the English soldier that merry old fellow whose jests and songs made us so often forget our sorrows  Enter FIRELOCK  Once more welcome to European ground my old son of fun and frolic  FIRELOCK  Aye my boy and a son who has never dishonour'd his family 'Tis only your common dull metal that rusts with the breath of care and misfortune the high polish of mirth and goodhumour always cast off the envenomed damp  LAURENCE  And did you really never meet with any misfortune which obliged you to complain  FIRELOCK  Faith I never remember lamenting but two misfortunes in my whole life one that I was not at the Prussian re∣view and the other that I had not the honour of being among the brave fellows besieged in GibraltarBut that's all over now However I hope I shall yet live to fight for my country  LAURENCE  I am going to return thanks to Signor Octavio  FIRELOCK  So shall I as soon as I am drest  LAURENCE  Drest  FIRELOCK  Aye I hardly dare call myself an Englishman while I wear the badges of slavery Our noble captain Ibrahim has kindly presented me with the very cloaths in which I was taken by the Algerines so within an hour you shall see me in that character which commands respect in every part of the worlda British soldierand then I shall want nothing but a mistress to make me compleatly happy  LAURENCE  They you know are to be purchased every where  FIRELOCK  Aye but I would as soon think of buying a friend as a mis∣tress Always barter love for love and friendship for friend∣ship for egad when either of the commodities are put up to sale depend upon it they are not worth buying However I don't despair of making myself pretty well understood by some kind Florentine girl or other Love I take it is an universal language much the same in most countries  LAURENCE  But you will remember it is a language in which the oldest scholars are not generally the greatest proficients  FIRELOCK  I understand you young man But I fear nothing I am a mixture of spring and autumn old Time and I have had so long a battle that he has given up the point at last and left me master of the field Besides if even a mistress should be coy I have yet my bottle to comfort me  AIR  "In vain whining lovers their Cupid shall prize  "And boast that his godship's deriv'd from the skies  "Tho' divine was the birth of the young god of Love  "Our Bacchus we know was the son of great Jove  "Let us number Love's vot'ries I think we can prove  "That tho' all the world drink 'tis not all the world love"  When malicious young Cupid o'erwhelms us with grief  In the comforts of Bacchus we find sure relief  Tho' Chloe disdainful deny you her charms  When glowing with rapture you rush to her arms  Pay your court to a bumper and there you will find  A gay smiling mistress eternally kind  Nay when chilling age like bleak winter comes on  And the sunshine of beauty and love shall be gone  Still constant your bumper will smile to the end  And supply both the places of mistress and friend  Let us number Love's vot'ries I think we can prove  That tho' all the world drink 'tis not all the world love  SCENE a Room in REGNALTO's House  Enter ALDOBRAND and VIOLA  ALDOBRAND  There are all the people in Florence out at their windows gaping at this scurvy procession of slaves Tinkle but an old brass shovel in the streets of this city and the inhabitants will swarm like bees at the sound One would think there was a triumph for some victory today  VIOLA  And what can be a nobler triumph than the triumph of hu∣manity what a nobler victory than that of freedom over slavery  ALDOBRAND  Psha don't tell me Selfpreservation is the first tie of nature  VIOLA  But is it the only tie Sir  ALDOBRAND  Charity should begin at home  VIOLA  And should charity end at home too  ALDOBRAND  Certainly you would not have me turn Charity out of doors She keeps house with sober decent people and only goes astray with such spendthrifts as OctavioBy the bye Viola Octavio has invited us to his house today  VIOLA  To his house Sir  Aside  How my heart beats And do you mean that we should accept of his invitation  ALDOBRAND  Why yes for once in a wayWe are to meet Signor Lu∣cilio and his wife Laura there  Aside  Laura is a charming creature  VIOLA  I am astonished Sir  ALDOBRAND  Don't be alarmed I'll take care to watch Octavio for I suppose he'll teaze you with a parcel of stuff that he is dying for love of you and  VIOLA  Do you really think he will  ALDOBRAND  Oh yes these rakish young dogs begin to make love the moment they see a woman just as naturally as you would say 'Pretty Pol' to a parrot but you must not answer him  VIOLA  Perhaps then he'll think that my silence gives consent  ALDOBRAND  Frown at him as you do at me when I make love to you and I'll be hang'd if he mistakes your silence for consent then  Exit  VIOLA  Well Signor Aldobrand since you teach me the lesson of dis∣simulation you must e'en take the consequences  AIR  Since you teach me dear Sir the art of deceiving  You surely can ne'er take it ill  If while with attention your lessons receiving  On yourself I should practise my skill  And when of your own wit the dupe I have made you  All doubts of your art 'twill remove  For you can't but esteem it a compliment paid you  To shew you how much I improve  So doating parents oft have smil'd  At mischief from a fav'rite child  And view'd with fond exulting joy  The growing genius of the boy  Who gives poor Hodge's aukward bow  And shews you how he goes to plough  Hits off the Vicar's vacant stare  Wry faces makes behind his chair  "Then slily mocks the Parson's quaffing  "While they almost expire with laughing  "Soon panting for satiric fame  "Our little master seeks new game  "And tir'd of laughing at the guest  "On host and hostess breaks his jest  "The father's gouty steps takes off  "His purblind eyes and winter's cough  "Nor can Mamma's pert smiling leer  "Escape the wicked urchin's sneer  "While giggling servants raptur'd sit  "To see how well the little wit"  Now apes the simpers of Mamma  Then coughs and hobbles like Papa  Reenter ALDOBRAND with FABIO  ALDOBRAND  Fabio this prodigal fool Octavio has ransom'd another parcel of slaves from Algiers  FABIO  Yes the procession has disturb'd the whole city  ALDOBRAND  And this is called generosity For my part Fabio I think such doings should not be tolerated When Fate has thought fit to send a man into slavery I think it is flying in the face of Fate to release him from his situation  FABIO  Your reasoning is very just Sir  ALDOBRAND  Fabio I never hear of a released captive but I think of Regnalto If by any ill luck he should find his way back to Florence  FABIO  Impossible Sir You know I have assured you  ALDOBRAND  Why yes you  have  assured me but you must know friend Fabio I don't think that telling truth is your forteHowever run and view this new cargo of slaves Bring me but a true account of Regnalto's not being among them and I'll com∣pound with you for a month's lying afterwards  Exit FABIO  Enter ALICE  Well Alice any news of the worthy Regnalto  ALICE  Alas no Sir  ALDOBRAND  AhNor of your husband  ALICE  No Sir I have heard nothing of poor Laurence  Aside  The old wretch shan't discover that I have  seen  him  ALDOBRAND  My poor friend I must give a tear to humanity  ALICE  Certainly Sir  Aside  It costs you nothing or else you would not give that  ALDOBRAND  Now to our own concernsDo you know Alice I have resolved to take Viola with me to visit Octavio  ALICE  To visit Laura you mean I find she is to be of the party  ALDOBRAND  Ha haWhy I don't think Laura has been insensible to my amorous glancesOnly I have never yet had an opportunity of explaining myself  ALICE  Aside  An old foolI'll turn this to Viola's account Lord Sir what a Turk you are among the women Marrying a young girl of eighteen and seducing a married woman of twenty at the same time I declare I should not expect it from you  ALDOBRAND  Psha psha the older a man grows the better use he should make of his timeBut tell me Alice how can I contrive to get a private interview with LauraSuppose in some disguise Let me tell you  disguise  is very useful to us men of gallantry  ALICE  No bad thought SirWhat say you to the dress of a  Monk It will not be the first time that garb has covered de∣signs as pious as yours  ALDOBRAND  A Monk's habitZounds a man might as well make love in his shrowd 'Tis a monument erected to signify the decease of human frailty  ALICE  Oh no Sir It will only like other monuments point out where the  remains  are depositedBut Sir you know a little money will be necessary for this business  ALDOBRAND  Money  ALICE  Certainly Sir Generosity is the only test of a lover's being in earnest  AIR  A fig for all your whining stuff  Fine speeches sweet as honey  Of love you can't give proof enough  Except you give your money  Were I your mistress faith and troth  Your av'rice soon would lose me  For compliments are but mere froth  You must good Sir excuse me  Of all the arrows Love can boast  The golden ones are best Sir  And he who boldly bids the most  Can never be in jest Sir  'Tis true that I make rather free  But faith you shan't refuse me  So draw your pursestrings now d'ye see  Or else you must excuse me  ALDOBRAND  Giving her Money  But egad I run a great hazard hereIndeed it is true I have no other means to get at Laura than by risquing Viola in Octa∣vio's house but then I must depend on your watchful care over her Alice  ALICE  Trust to me Sir  ALDOBRAND  If the young slut should dare to listen to himIf she should forget herself so far as to  ALICE  Follow her own inclinations as you do her crime would certainly be of the blackest dye  ALDOBRAND  Psha But you know the weakness and inexperience of young girls  ALICE  For which reason their faults are to be more severely punished Well I admire the men who while they are continually boast∣ing a superiority of understanding very modestly reserve to them∣selves the privilege of committing acts of folly with impunity  Exeunt  SCENE An Apartment in OCTAVIO's House  Enter REGNALTO and LAURENCE  LAURENCE  Lord Sir we have waited a great while to see Signor Oc∣tavio I dare say he will excuse our going now Ceremony I am told is quite out of fashion with great folks  REGNALTO  What would you quit his house without thanking him for your liberty Do you not feel the warmth of gratitude for so inestimable a gift  AIR  Grief thy tyrant reign is o'er  Now I tread my native shore  Mirth fair Freedom's sister guest  Shall impart her choicest zest  To each flask of gen'rous wine  Gaily offer'd at her shrine  See the sparkling glass goes round  Care avaunt tis hallow'd ground  LAURENCE  I think humility should teach us that to wait among the ser∣vants is the properest situation for usI hear them now at sup∣per Sir and as we are but slaves  REGNALTO  Slaves the noble Octavio will receive us as friends  LAURENCE  Then Sir for that very reason we should go to supperWhen a generous man entertains his friends at his own house he is always best pleased to see them eat heartily  REGNALTO  Peace Here comes Octavio  Enter OCTAVIO  Generous Octavio we owe you thanks which language can never express  OCTAVIO  Silence Sir will be the most acceptable eloquence on that subject Your mien and deportment bespeak you of no vulgar rank  LAURENCE  Aside  He says nothing of my mien and deportment  OCTAVIO and REGNALTO converse aside  OCTAVIO  Do not mistake me I have not the smallest wish to know any thing you may desire to conceal No one is under restraint here as long as it suits your convenience make this your home and accept in the mean time whatever my house affords  LAURENCE  Thank you my lord I wish we had known as much before perhaps we should have made free I am sure I should But to night we sup at Signor Regnalto's though I think a little snack before supper  REGNALTO frowns  OCTAVIO  To REGNALTO  What were you acquainted with Regnalto  LAURENCE  Yes my lord and he had a very great regard for him too or I am much mistaken  OCTAVIO  Perhaps then you know his sister  REGNALTO  Alas Sir I fear she has forgotten me It is ten years ago since I held the little prattler on my knee  LAURENCE  And now I suppose Signor Octavio would be glad in turn to hold the little prattler on  his  knee  OCTAVIO  Alas had Viola a parent living there would be no longer any obstacle to our happiness but to have my hopes blasted thus by an avaricious guardian  AIR  When Prudence opposes the dictates of Love  A parent may fairly our choice disapprove  'Tis kind then to save us  From what would enslave us  To tell us the tale of Experience with truth  And check by advice the wild sallies of youth  But when Prudence smiles on the soft nuptial band  And Affection and Reason are join'd hand in hand  With Hymen's torch lighted  Our mutual faith plighted  Alas how severe is Fate's partial decree  That cruelly tears me my charmer from thee  Sir I will confer on you what to the noble mind is one of the most acceptable favoursan opportunity of shewing your gra∣titude I love Signora Viola here is a letter in which I pro∣pose that she should fly with me this evening from the power of the wretch with whom her unsuspecting brother too hastily en∣trusted her This letter you shall do me the favour to deliver  LAURENCE  Aside  A mighty pretty employ my master has got into  OCTAVIO  I have invited Aldobrand to bring the charming Viola with him today but as I hardly expect any success from that scheme this letter is my last resource  Enter SERVANT  SERVANT  The captain of the ship from Algiers Sir begs to speak with you  Exit  OCTAVIO  Adieu I will not offend your zeal to serve me by urging that secresy on which my success depends  Exit  REGNALTO  Laurence  LAURENCE  Sir  REGNALTO  This is rather a singular situation  LAURENCE  Not at all Sir Nothing can be more regular When a lover thinks of marrying his mistress her nearest relation should always be one of the first persons consulted on the businessBut here comes my dear Alice  REGNALTO  Don't discover who I am Laurence  LAURENCE  I wont Sir I won'tHow her eyes sparkle while she is looking for me  REGNALTO  Enquire after my sister  LAURENCE  I will SirPretty roguePretty rogue  REGNALTO  I am very impatient  LAURENCE  Yes Sir so am I  Enter ALICE  ALICE  Ah my poor Laurence  Embracing him  LAURENCE  Poor indeed AliceIIWell and how d'ye do I had a thousand things to say to you but they are all jumbled to∣gether and like a great crowd trying to get out of the playhouse they press on one another till they quite choak up the passage  ALICE  You are wasted away prodigiously  LAURENCE  Aye I am not the man I was Alice  ALICE  I am very sorry for it Laurence  LAURENCE  When you and I parted I was as plump as good living and laughing could make me but now I may indeed saymy wife is my better half  REGNALTO pulls his Sleeve  And pray how does your young lady doPretty little soul she  ALICE  Why I'll tell youBut I see we are not alone Who is that  LAURENCE  A brother captive of mine He is both deaf and dumb so you may say what you will before him  REGNALTO  Aside  The rogue has not lost his old knack at invention  ALICE  La what a pity it is that such a welllooking man should have any deficiencies  LAURENCE  But tell me how is your young lady  ALICE  As well as any poor girl can be when she is doom'd to marry a miserly old guardian who tells her forsooth that she shall find a  father  in him  REGNALTO  Aside  An old villain  LAURENCE  Well Alice and do you think there so any thing so much amiss in a husband's becoming a father  ALICE  Signor Regnalto he says has certainly died in slaveryNow I think of it can you tell me any news of our old master  LAURENCE  I can't indeed Alice so don't ask me any thing about him  ALICE  Poor man Gone I suppose I am sorry for him  LAURENCE  We shall never have such another master  ALICE  No never He was the most good temper'd creature One of the best men in the world for a servant to live with So easily cheated  LAURENCE  Easily cheated No no Alice That's too much  ALICE  Nay Laurence I am sure you know it as well as any body living How many bottles of his best wine did you drink and made him believe the rats got into the cellar and eat away the corks  LAURENCE  Lord Lord  REGNALTO  Aside  I shall make some interesting discoveries  LAURENCE  Not another word Alice  ALICE  Why what the deuce are you afraid of You may be sure a dumb man can't  make any words  about the matter  REGNALTO  Aside to LAURENCE  'Tis lucky for you sirrah that you have deprived me of my speech  ALICE  HeydayWhat can he whisper  LAURENCE  No but he makes a queer comical kind of a noise which I who am used to him can understand as well as if he spoke ever so distinctly  ALICE  And what does he mean  LAURENCE  Why to let me know he is hungry as I am and i'faith 'tis no wonder considering how long it is since we tasted roastmeat Let us take him home with us Alice You will find him a mighty agreeable companion he will never contra∣dict you  ALICE  I declare he seems as if he understood every word we say  LAURENCE  Oh he is very intelligent I can teach him any thingBut come Never did soldier long more for conquest than I do to attack my supperMy dear Alice we'll be as merry as love and good wine can make us  Exeunt  Enter OCTAVIO and MONTANO  OCTAVIO  Heavens Montano what a difference must this Algerine ha∣bit make in you when even I did not discover you who but three years ago was the most intimate friend you had in Flo∣rence  MONTANO  But Laura  OCTAVIO  Inconsolable for your loss she sequester'd herself from the world for some time  MONTANO  That was kind  OCTAVIO  At length however to the surprize of every one after slighting the first noblemen in Florence she suddenly married a young stranger  MONTANO  A stranger  OCTAVIO  Named Lucilio Gentle yet lively in his manners in his person an Adonis in miniature  MONTANO  Do not oppress me with his praises rather say that he is base unworthythat my sword  OCTAVIO  Hold Montano I conjure you by our friendshipLucilio and Laura are here Consider this house is their sanctuary retire but for a moment you shall see Laura presently nay you shall even speak to herI beg only a moment's delay  MONTANO and OCTAVIO retire  Enter LAURA and ROSA  LAURA  Oh Rosa this uncertainty of my Montano's fate like the torturing arts of medicine protracts my unhappy life but too long  ROSA  Upon my word Madam you must think me a very com∣plaisant husband thus to make me the confidante of your affec∣tion for another  LAURA  You are a strange girl However I must own it was a lucky thought for me which suggested this scheme of calling you my husband to get rid of the importunities of my lovers  ROSA  Yes really and lucky for me too from your humble companion in petticoats to become your lord and master in breechesI am sure I may truly say  marriage has made a man of me  LAURA  But hear me Rosa  ROSA  Rosayou forget that I am your husband Aye and so kind and so indulgent too Am not I the best of husbands  LAURA sighs  Ah you will never know my value till you have got your beloved Signor Montano and then you'll soon find the difference between us  LAURA  You trifler  ROSA  However though we may forget ourselves in private let us at least take care to behave like husband and wife in pub∣lic that is no more than many married couples oblige them∣selves to do But seriously my dear Madam is it possible you can doubt Montano's constancy Duty and reason will secure  LAURA  Duty and reason when opposed to loveOh Rosa  AIR  In vain when with the fatal dart  Unerring in his aim  The little Archer wounds the heart  Does Reason urge her claim  The pow'rful sun of Beauty's eyes  Beams forth too bright a ray  She thaws cold Duty with her sighs  And Reason melts away  OCTAVIO and MONTANO come forward  OCTAVIO  To Laura  My friend Ibrahim is lately from Algiers Madam  Introduces MONTANO then walks apart with ROSA  LAURA  IIhad a friend carried to that part of the world Sir for whom I am much interested  MONTANO  Aside  How guilt flushes her cheeks I knew him well Madam  LAURA  You knew himahis name was  MONTANO  Aside  Zounds I forgot to wait for my name  LAURA  Montano a native of Florence  MONTANO  MontanoHehewas my friend Madam  LAURA  Then you can tell me news of him  Aside  Now for life or death  MONTANO  He is no longer considered as a Christian slave He has taken the turban I myself saw him last in the Algerine habit  LAURA  Heaven and earth  MONTANO  I have heard him often repeat the name of Laura  LAURA  IndeedYou distress me Sir  MONTANO  Montano lov'd her once lov'd her as the slave who now adores her  Seizing LAURA's Hand  LAURA  You are bold Sir  MONTANO  And is that Madam a fault in the estimation of a lady  LAURA  I have a husband Sir who will answer whether it ought not to be so in mineSignor Octavio a word with you  Walks aside with OCTAVIO  ROSA comes forward  MONTANO  And do you Sir take upon you to chastise every one who dares to love that lady  ROSA  Not I upon my soul Sir It would be a very troublesome office Besides it is too flattering to my vanity to have my wife universally beloved  MONTANO  She was beloved by Montano Did you know him Sir  ROSA  Montano MontanoOh the man who went one after∣noon to fish in the Mediterranean and was himself caught by an Algerine rover  MONTANO  Did you know Montano young Sir  ROSA  Oh yes Sir I recollect he had the vanity to be my rival Poor man I ought not to abuse him for I owe him infinite obligations for the merriment Laura and I have so often had at his expence  MONTANO  'Sdeath Sir you dare not repeat what you say  ROSA  Really Sir I don't desire it Tautology in conversation is very disagreeable  MONTANO  If Montano were here  ROSA  Why if he were Sir I should certainly pity the poor devil To be laugh'd at by a successful rival would be intolerable and really I could not help itHa ha ha  AIR  When first I began Sir to ogle the ladies  And prattle soft nothings as a pretty fellow's trade is  While with rapturous praises I dwelt on each feature  If I stole a sly kiss 'twas'Fye you wicked creature'  But soon in tones lower and softer and sweeter  Halfpleas'd they would whisper'Fye fye you wicked 'creature'  Indeed my attractions no gallantry needed  Each evening still conquests to conquests succeeded  Perplex'd how so many fond claims I should parry  To settle all disputes I resolv'd faith to marry  Then press'd lovely Laura in language still sweeter  Till blushing she whisper'd'I'm yours you wicked creature'  MONTANO  Hark'e Signor Lucilio I will not hear Montano insulted with impunity I shall walk by the riverside two miles from the city at six tomorrow morning You understand me Sir  ROSA  Aside  A pretty scrape I am got intoPerfectly Sir You find the air from the water beneficial to your health  MONTANO  Insulting coward draw instantly  ROSA  Looking round and perceiving OCTAVIO approach to part them  Zounds Sir with all my heart This is not to be borneSignor Octavio nothing but the respect I bear you prevents my punishing that boaster as he deserves Your pre∣sence protects him from my rage  Aside to LAURA  Let us be gone I am frightened out of my wits  OCTAVIO  Signor Lucilio I am concerned for my friend's warmth  ROSA  As to that Sir I am very happy you interfered I declare I  tremble  to think what might have been the consequence  LAURA  Signor Octavio what has passed will I am sure plead my apology for begging your permission to retire  QUARTETTO  LAURA  Good Signor you'll excuse me  Pray don't my dear refuse me  Lucilio let us go  ROSA  Laura you must excuse me  Satisfaction you shan't refuse me  Before I go  OCTAVIO  Good Signor you'll excuse me  Pray don't my friend refuse me  Hold Sir you must excuse me  Pray good Lucilio go  LAURA  Be by your reason aided  Why won't you be persuaded  Hear me  Come your passion smother  For this you'll thank me some day or other  Lucilio let us go  Signor Octavio with thanks to you Sir  Adieu adieu Sir  Lucilio let us go  ROSA  No I'll not be persuaded  Hear me  Eh well then my passion I'll try to smother  Adieu Signor I go  But I shall find Sir some time or other  For a private word or so  OCTAVIO  Why won't you be persuaded  Hear me  Hold Before a lady  Your anger smother    Pray good Lucilio go  You may you know find some time or other  For a private word or so  MONTANO  No Sir I shan't excuse you  Justice I won't refuse you  Before you go  No I'll not be persuaded  Hear me  My anger I cannot smother  Nay Sir you shall not go  Well I shall find Sir some time or other  For a private word or so  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE REGNALTO's House  Enter ALICE and LAURENCE with a Bottle of Wine in one Hand and Bread in the other  LAURENCE  TELL the cook to make haste Alice I like my victuals rather under done  ALICE  You have been us'd to eat your meat rare I suppose  LAURENCE  Yes the meat that came to my share in Algiers was very  rare  indeednot above once a month  ALICE  And how did they treat you Laurence Tell me all about it  LAURENCE  They treated me with my  board  to be sureto sleep on I mean a scarcity of bread and water and plenty of stripes and hard labour For my part I had rather pay my own way in Florence than be  treated  so by the best Algerine of 'em all  ALICE  Pray Laurence had your master many wives  LAURENCE  Wives aye in every hole and corner of his house they ran about like rabbits in a warren  ALICE  And did not you turn poacher now and then and snap up a stray rabbitEh Laurence  LAURENCE  Not I indeed I had a much keener appetite for a fat caponHunger is a bitter enemy to gallantryBesides the Infidels have ways of keeping their wives to themselves which we have not yet attain'd  ALICE  By making slaves of themThank my stars that odious fashion does not prevail in Christendom  LAURENCE  "No the matter is just revers'd with us

Ma'amI am much rejoiced to see myself here  VIOLA  I imagine you have had a sufficient sample of travelling  LAURENCE  Enough to last me my life Ma'am  VIOLA  And what think you of the men and manners where you have been  LAURENCE  As for the men the least said about them is the best and as for their manners egad I never was treated with so much illmanners by any other set of people before or since  VIOLA  Laurence you are released from the chains of a tyrant just time enough to see me in fetters  RONDEAU  Woman's fate is still distressing  Be her lot whate'er it will  Man perverts her every blessing  To a cause of future ill  If with charms her form enduing  Nature kindest care employs  Man the gaudy prize pursuing  Conquers first and then destroys  Riches serve but to entoil her  Like the bee with honey stor'd  Her wealth allures the cruel spoiler  And dooms hervictim of her hoard  "Tomorrow is the day fix'd by my inexorable guardian to make me his wretched wifeOh for the presence of a brother to save me from this living death"  Enter REGNALTO  But Alice tells me you can give no tidings of the unfortunate Regnalto  LAURENCE  I know no more of him than this good man  Pointing to

situation must plead my excuse for the pro∣posal I thus abruptly offer Tomorrow is to make you the wife of Aldobrand suffer me to snatch you from the misery in which this detested marriage would

particularly happy  "ROSA  "I know you are a man of gallantry  "ALDOBRAND  Aside  "Egad I am sorry for that  "ROSA  "And therefore I wish for your counselBut are we out of hearing  "ALDOBRAND  "As snug as a conclave of cardinals"  ROSA  Give me leave to ask you what measures do you think I ought to pursue with the man who has dar'd to make love to my wife  ALDOBRAND  Aa  Aside  Oh that I were but safe out of the room Why surelyis it possible that  ROSA  Possible why not Sir Is not Laura handsome enough to be an object of temptation  ALDOBRAND  Upon my soul I think so Sir Don't mistake me  Aside  What shall I say to him  ROSA  When I consider the nature of the affront  ALDOBRAND  But consider at the same time good Signor how liable we all are to frailty Temptation is an enemy who wrestles with us through life growing stronger as we grow weaker and if youth can't resist him 'tis not to be wondered at that he should easily trip up an old man's heels  ROSA  I am resolv'd to punish him severely  ALDOBRAND  Aside  I shall be expos'd to all Florence Are there no apologies which you could be prevailed on to receive  ROSA  What apologies can he offer after having had the assurance to threaten my life  ALDOBRAND  Aside  I threaten his lifeWhat the devil does he mean now  ROSA  The presumption to challenge me to single combat  ALDOBRAND  Challenge youUpon my veracity I never dreamt of such a thing  ROSA  Yes the haughty Algerine dared me to measure swords with him  ALDOBRAND  The haughty Algerine  ROSA  Ibrahim the commander of the vessel last from Algiers

two hours time  ROSA  Will that be strictly legal  ALDOBRAND  Legal aye to be sure if it can serve a friend Laws were made for the benefit of society and are not our friends the very flower of society  ROSA  But let us be careful not to infringe the strict letter of the law  ALDOBRAND  Aye that is a true oracle always doubtful in it's meaning We lawyers are the priests and who so proper to expound it as we who make it The letter of the law reminds me of a fanciful cloud in a summer sky though no two persons can agree in what it really represents you may look at it till you make what you will of it  "ROSA  "And yet how beautiful are those clouds when gilded by the sun of equity  "ALDOBRAND  "Psha psha when the clouds gather fast the sun of equity as you call it sometimes finds it a devilish hard task to shine through them" But come let us to business we have not a moment to lose I'll dispatch the officers of justice after this Ibrahim and they'll seize him the instant they set eyes on him  ROSA  Well Signor Aldobrand I perceive you improve on the poets who represent Justice as blind you kindly remove the band from her eyes that she may distinguish objects clearly  ALDOBRAND  Modern Justice is only blind to the faults of her friends  ROSA  And what does she do with her sword  ALDOBRAND  Reserves that for their enemies  ROSA  Ha ha haThen her scales only remain to be dispos'd of  ALDOBRAND  Which are too useful to be parted with They are for the receipt of fees one scale for the plaintiff and the other for the defendant of course you know that which is best fill'd makes the other kick the beamAnd so much for justice  Exeunt  SCENE the House of OCTAVIO  Enter OCTAVIO and ALICE  OCTAVIO  Well Alice then the charming Viola is permitted by her guardian to visit this house today You may depend on my gratitude  "ALICE  "I will Sir though I own it is not a quality on which generally speaking I place the greatest dependance  "OCTAVIO  "Surely you do not doubt it's existence you do not think it a mere phantom"  ALICE  Why really Sir my experience has taught me that gratitude is something like a ghost every body talks of it but nobody sees it appear  OCTAVIO  As to that I can easily conjure up the apparition  Giving her a Purse  How do you like it  ALICE  Oh I admire your  spirit  I assure you Sir It could not ap∣pear in a prettier shape  OCTAVIO  But tell me dear Alice how am I to elude the vigilance of Aldobrand  ALICE  Very easily Sir You must know the old fool expects to meet Laura her with whom he is most desperately in loveBut I see him coming I'll engage him while you slip down stairs and entertain your mistress  Exit OCTAVIO  Enter ALDOBRAND  ALDOBRAND  Here I am so amorousbut so frighten'd My heart is like a volcano in Iceland fire and frost at the same time If Lau∣ra should not requite my passionif I should fail Alice  ALICE  Fail Sir there is no such word in the lover's dictionary  ALDOBRAND  Then I suppose mine is the old edition for egad I think I see it in the titlepage in black letter It frightens me so that I can't  turn over a new leaf  ALICE  Come Sir I'll comfort you with an example in a ballad which I learnt of an English captain who us'd to visit my poor master Signor Regnalto  AIR  Young Roger the ploughman who wanted a mate  Went along with his daddy a courting to Kate  With nosegay so large in his holiday cloaths  His hands in his pockets away Roger goes  Now he was as bashful as bashful could be  And Kitty poor girl was as bashful as he  So he bow'd and he star'd and he let his hat fall  Then he grinn'd scratch'd his head and saidnothing at all  If aukward the swain no less aukward the maid  She simper'd and blush'd with her apronstring play'd  Till the old folks impatient to have the thing done  Agreed that young Roger and Kate should be one  In silence the young ones both nodded assent  Their hands being join'd to be married they went  Where they answer'd the parson with voices so small  You'd have sworn that they both had saidnothing at all  But mark what a change In the course of a week  Kate quite left off blushing Hodge boldly could speak  Could joke with his deary laugh loud at the jest  She could coax too and fondle as well as the best  And asham'd of past folly they've often declar'd  To encourage young folks who at courtship are scar'd  If at first to your aid some assurance you call  When once you are us'd to it 'tisnothing at all  A lover is like a swimmer fear will be sure to sink him  ALDOBRAND  Then egad I shall certainly go to the bottom Alice  ALICE  Never fear that SirTrust to the corkjacket I have brought you  Shewing his Disguise  This will keep your head above water I'll warrantCome Sir let me help you on with it  ALDOBRAND  Putting on the Friar's Dress  Heigho make haste and lead me to Laura that I may face the enemy while I have courage enough left for the attack  ALICE  I'll go and reconnoitre Sir  ALDOBRAND  And d'ye hear keep an eye on ViolaYou know Oc∣tavio is a few years younger than I am and young girls have a devilish hankering after green fruit  Exit ALICE  Enter FIRELOCK  FIRELOCK  Who have we here a Friar I did not expect to meet with so holy a man I was in search of one Signor Aldobrand a rich old lawyer of this cityDo you know him father  ALDOBRAND  I know the man  FIRELOCK  Perhaps you are his confessor I'faith if you are you must have a troublesome task of it by all accounts I am sure you deserve to be paid well for keeping such a batter'd old conscience in repair  ALDOBRAND  Aside  How I long to break the rascal's head  FIRELOCK  But I can't think where the old fellow can be gone He was seen to enter this room not half an hour ago  ALDOBRAND  Why what the devil are you set to watch him you dog  FIRELOCK  Heyday here's language for a man of mortification You seem to have forgot yourself father  ALDOBRAND  Rather so indeedBut if you knew me better you would find me a true son of the church  FIRELOCK  Aye I dare say One of those dutiful children who are sel∣dom better pleas'd than when they are drinking their motherchurch in full bumpers and lest her family should be extinct like good sons take all the care in their power to provide her with grandsons  ALDOBRAND  I forgive your scurrility friendYou shall find that Monkish manners can cover liberality of sentiment  FIRELOCK  As an extinguisher covers a candleBut here come Octavio and Viola  ALDOBRAND  Aside  A comfortable situation I shall be in to be sure for though I should be cuckolded before my face I must like a snail draw my horns within my shell  Enter OCTAVIO and VIOLA  FIRELOCK  We are all safe Sir the enemy has retreated and left you master of the field  OCTAVIO  Follow Aldobrand my faithful friend lest he should return unexpectedlyBut who is this  FIRELOCK  Oh as for this ghostly father though he may hitherto have been a neutral power I dare say he is a true politician and now victory has declared for you will have no objection to be∣come your ally  Exit  OCTAVIO  A lucky thought This good priest shall join our handsYou tremble Viola  VIOLA  Oh Octavio you will forgive that timidity which makes me start at the precipitancy of a measure  OCTAVIO  Which alone can release you from the power of an avaricious tyrantI'll submit the case to this worthy man convinc'd that I could not have fix'd on any person better qualified to de∣cide the matter  ALDOBRAND  Aside  I wish to my soul the worthy man were safe at homeA plague on this masquerading If he finds me out I shall have his sword through me in a twinkling  OCTAVIO  My good father this lady is threatened with marriage by her guardian a wretch whom if you knew you must despiseShe has bless'd me with the avowal of her affection  VIOLA  That avowal Octavio I willingly repeat Why should I blush to own my acquaintance with Love while he is the com∣panion of Virtue  ALDOBRAND  Aside  The devil take her fine sentiments  OCTAVIO  Thus then let me seize this charming hand and our good friend here I am persuaded will chearfully assist me in making it my own  ALDOBRAND shakes his Head  "What you say 'No' Perhaps you are not aware what a sad old fellow this guardian is he reviles ecclesiastical government where∣ever he goes and declares he hates a priest so much that he is ready to faint at the sight of his habit He says it resem∣bles charity for it is always sure to cover a multitude of sins"  VIOLA  You seem to be mistaken in the person to whom you apply Octavio  ALDOBRAND  Aside  Most cursedly mistaken if he knew all  OCTAVIO  As to his shaking his head that is a disorder easily cur'd by a proper application to the palm of the patient's hand  Giving Money to ALDOBRAND  ALDOBRAND  Aside  Egad if I refuse money he'll soon discover me to be no churchman  Taking the Money  OCTAVIO  Are you better fatherNot quite cur'd yet ehI must touch the other hand then  Giving him more Money  Now I'll answer for it he'll find himself

upon And now perhaps he'll think me an accomplice in the plot I shall run mad with vexationAs for you Sig∣nora Viola I shall take care that you shall never speak another word to that vile seducer  Aside to VIOLA  Tell him im∣mediately how we are circumstanced  Aside to ALDOBRAND while VIOLA whispers  OCTAVIOAh my dear Sir how lucky it was for us all that I came in just at the moment I didWhat deceit there is in the world  ALDOBRAND  Aside to ALICE  A dn'd deal indeedAlice you must take care they don't suspect me  ALICE  Aside to ALDOBRAND  Leave that to me Sir I blush for you Signora Viola to behave so to your guardianAnd as for you Signor Octavio  OCTAVIO  I should have been married by this time had it not been for that piece of mock sanctity "who dar'd to receive money for what he never intended to perform" But I'm resolv'd to take the most signal revenge  ALICE  Dear Sir what do you mean  Aside to OCTAVIO  Stick to that Bless me how your eyes roll Don't be rash  ALDOBRAND  Aside to ALICE  What is to become of me Alice  ALICE  Surely Signor Octavio you don't mean to attempt his life  ALDOBRAND  Aside to ALICE  Hold your tongue He won't think of killing me if you don't put him in mind of it  ALICE  To be sure the poor gentleman is entirely in your power It would be the easiest thing in the world to destroy him with∣out it's being discover'd You might hang him in the garden or drown him in the riveror shoot himorlet me see  ALDOBRAND  Aside to ALICE  The devil's in the wenchYou forget that you are counsel for the defendant  ALICE  Aside to ALDOBRAND  It may happen to the best advocate who has no retaining fee to remind him that is the only anchor which can keep him steady to you  ALDOBRAND  Giving her Money  Why I gave you one this morning But you seem soon blown from your anchor as you call it  ALICE  Consider Sir what a storm we are in  OCTAVIO  It is impossible my dear Viola Not even your entreaties can disarm my resentment  ALICE  What Sir not if he agrees to marry you  OCTAVIO  Aside  Agrees to marry meWhat the devil can she mean nowOn that condition indeed  ALICE  Leave me to calm the fears of the good man  OCTAVIO  Well father I leave you to your female friend Eloquence you know is the gift of the sex I dare say Alice will persuade you to listen to the voice of reason though I cannot  Exeunt OCTAVIO and VIOLA  ALDOBRAND  Egad if Reason speaks through your voice I don't wonder that so few people in the world listen to her for the very tone  of it is enough to throw one into a quaking fitA pretty sort of an engagement you have form'd for me Alice How the devil am I to fulfil it  ALICE  Why Sir you must e'en run away that's the most ap∣proved remedy when a man can't fulfil his engagements  Enter MONTANO who seeing ALDOBRAND and ALICE retires to the Back of the Scene  "MONTANO  Aside  "A confession scene as I take it I may chance to profit by it"  ALDOBRAND  But then I leave Viola behind me  ALICE  I'll take care she shall soon follow you I can persuade Oc∣tavio to any thing You see I have gain'd his confidence  ALDOBRAND  Egad if you have gain'd his  confidence  you have made a pretty comfortable addition to your own stock for I think he has as good a share as any man I ever knew  ALICE  I have news to tell you of your beloved Laura  MONTANO  Aside  His beloved Laura  "ALICE  "But I fancy in this jumble of passions love has sunk to the bottom  "ALDOBRAND  "Why i'faith fear is the oil of the passions attempt to mix it with whatever you will it is always sure to swim at top  "ALICE  "Which proves that with you love is  weighty  and fear  light  But I have to inform you Sir that Laura left this house on pre∣tence of illness and that she is now at home where she ex∣pects you"  MONTANO  Aside  I'm on the rack  ALDOBRAND  Why IIshould like to visit herBut are you sure shan't meet with another couple who want to be married  ALICE  My dear Signor Aldobrand consider what an opportunity I have settled every thing with Laura's maid she will admit you as a friar sent to visit her mistress by her confessor who is indisposed  MONTANO  Aside  Distraction  ALDOBRAND  To personate a confessorExcellentII will go Alice  ALICE  Then I will step into the garden to secure Octavio and Viola in chat You follow me presently  Exit  ALDOBRAND  Upon my soul a father confessor who has the keeping of a pretty girl's conscience leads a mighty agreeable life The pleasure of giving absolution must be so great that like a skilful physician who delights in being constantly employed one might be tempted now and then to make a flaw in a patient's consti∣tution for the satisfaction of performing the cure  MONTANO  coming forward and drawing his Sabre  Stop doctor  ALDOBRAND  Ah good Signor what would you have Do you wish to be marriedSpare my life and command my services  MONTANO  Signor Aldobrand I have overheard the whole of your pious conversation and am so much edified by it that I am resolv'd to quit the turban and assume the religious habit which you wearYes I am determined to try the virtues of that magic garment which can blind the eyes of a fine woman to age and infirmity for surely without such assistance you could never have presumed to think of gallantry  ALDOBRAND  I don't know that  "MONTANO  "Can that shrivell'd countenance and those tottering limbs be form'd for seduction  "ALDOBRAND"  There is no fix'd standard for beauty and ladies often dif∣fer in their tastes  MONTANO  We'll settle that point another time In the mean while we must exchange dresses you shall have my vest and turban in return for your disguise of holiness  ALDOBRAND  Turn Mahometan  MONTANO  Men of true piety like you never regard externals Come uncase my old Adonis No more words to the bargain  ALDOBRAND  Upon my soul 'tis a devilish hard bargain  They exchange Dresses  MONTANO  Now then Dissimulation assist me to avenge the cause of an injur'd lover and punish the lost and guilty LauraSignor Aldobrand one serious word before we part  ALDOBRAND  One serious wordWhy then perhaps you have hitherto been in jest  MONTANO  Dare not as you regard your life to follow me nor to dis∣cover whither I am going And so adieu  Exit  ALDOBRAND  Good bye to yeHeigho a pretty metamorphosis  Looking at himself  I am made a mere peg to hang castoff cloaths on A child's doll dress'd and undress'd ten times in a day I suppose I shall keep my Algerine dress no longer than till somebody else takes a fancy to itOh here comes one of the footmen I may as well begin to strip for I dare say I must put on his livery  Enter SERVANT  SERVANT  Signor Montano my master begs you will conceal yourself immediately The officers of justice are in quest of you He suspects foul play as they are sent hither by Aldobrand who was seen here just now disguised as a Friar  ALDOBRAND  Aside  So I have issued a warrant to apprehend myself  SERVANT  Hark the officers are forcing their way in and my master and his followers are defending the entrance with their swords  Exit  ALDOBRAND  Ah 'tis all over with me Here am I in my rival's house with another man's cloaths on my back having lost my cha∣racter my wife my mistress and almost lost myself I am an actual numerationtable of losses they rise upon me by tens hundreds and thousandsAnd here come more plagues How the devil shall I manage to conceal myself Egad I'll slip down this staircase  Exit  Enter OCTAVIO and VIOLA  OCTAVIO  Cast away your scruples my love and rely upon me  AIR  By that eloquent language which speaks in the eyes  By the ardour which breathes in the lover's sad sighs  As in absence the nameless soft wishes arise  I pr'ythee now hear me my dearest  By those fond anxious doubts which all lovers must feel  Which altho' some few moments of bliss they may steal  Yet fan love's pure flame and still wound but to heal  I pr'ythee now hear me my dearest  By our hopes when the moment of meeting is nigh  When affection no longer can pardon deny  Hopes which live in a look in a word in a sigh  I pr'ythee now hear me my dearest  By my passion for which words alas are too weak  By that lovedawning blush which now glows on your cheek  And so kindly avows what your tongue will not speak  I pr'ythee now hear me my dearest  Make yourself perfectly easy my dear Viola Montano will protect you I thought he was here but I know the agonies of his mind drive him from society to seek relief in solitude  Enter ALICE  Alice where is the Algerine captain  ALICE  Algerine captainOh you mean the man with the turban whom I met just now stealing down the dark private staircase which leads to the garden with his hands before his face like a sulky child endeavouring to escape a whipping There is no fear of your losing him Sir except he can creep through the keyhole for I lock'd the door as I came up and put the key in my pocket to prevent old Aldobrand's surprizing us  Enter ALDOBRAND behind  ALDOBRAND  Aside  The door is fast sure enoughI must try t'other side as soon as the coast is clear  OCTAVIO  That gentleman whom you met in the Algerine dress is a native of this city "and unfortunately attach'd to Signora Laura  "ALDOBRAND  Aside  "The devil then I am discover'd"  OCTAVIO  His name is Montano  ALDOBRAND  Aside and stifling a Laugh  That's very well i'faith  OCTAVIO  I have the strongest reliance on his friendship  ALDOBRAND  Aside  He little thinks that my appearance of friendship is like some other friendshipsa mere disguise which I shall throw off as soon as convenient  OCTAVIO  In a word I will entrust Viola to his care while I stay to face the expected storm  "ALICE  "Shall I run and fetch him Sir  "OCTAVIO  "It is by no means necessary at this unfortunate moment my conversation would serve only to distress him  "ALDOBRAND  Aside  "It would indeed most plaguily  "OCTAVIO  "Only beg him to accompany Viola to my house by the riverside Two trusty servants will attend him  "VIOLA  "Surely Octavio I should be safer under this roof  "OCTAVIO  "No my charmer Montano will conduct you to a more agreeable asylum to a place which I hope my Viola will shortly call her home  ALDOBRAND  Aside  "Yes egad I'll take care she shall soon find herself at home  "OCTAVIO  "Oh Montano I commit my existence into your hands"Tell him my dear Alice to watch over her as if she were the darling of his own soul I know he will with pleasure receive the precious pledge from me  ALDOBRAND  Aside  With great pleasure indeed "And I fancy when once I get the precious pledge in my possession you will find it no easy matter to redeem itBut I must retreat to my hidingplace"  OCTAVIO  We have no time to lose my love Give your hand to  my  friend and  your  guardian  ALDOBRAND  Aside  Ha ha ha  Exit  VIOLA

thou think'st no more my love  With jealous pangs my bosom torn  I wish that fair of thine my love  That fatal fair may treat with scorn  Those vows which once were mine my love  But ah how sharp Love's venom'd steel  Inconstant tho' thou be my love  Ah may'st thou never never feel  What Laura feels for thee my love  I cannot muster up spirits enough to execute your scheme  "ROSA  "But consider my dear Madam it is the only means by which I can save myself from the fury of this mad Algerine"  LAURA  How can you ask me at this time when my heart is so sen∣sibly touch'd  ROSA  Well Madam and do not I run the risque of having my heart  sensibly touch'd  by the point of a smallsword Let me tell you that is much the worst touch of the two I repeat to you Madam that old rogue Aldobrand has let Ibrahim escape and while he is at liberty I dare not venture abroad  LAURA  And so you would really wish me to receive this odious visit from Aldobrand  ROSA  That I may surprize him with you and work on the fears of the old wretch to make him secure Ibrahim  LAURA  I don't like your scheme Rosa There is an indelicacy in subjecting my ears to be offended with the mention of an illicit passion  ROSA  There might be I grant you from the lips of a youthful gal∣lant like Ibrahim "in whose breast the passion glows hotenough to scorch the reputation of every female who exposes herself to it's influence" but as for poor old AldobrandLord Ma'am in him it is the mere Aurora Borealis of love a few straggling faint rays from the sun that is set which vanish al∣most as soon as they are seen and have only the appearance of heat without the realityTo give me a fair occasion for com∣ing into the room you must scream out upon which I rush in andBut who have we here  Enter FIRELOCK  FIRELOCK  My abrupt visit will apologize for itself Sir when I tell you that I come to offer you my services in assisting to punish Aldo∣brand who is now entering your house disguis'd as a friar  LAURA  Aside to ROSA  Heavens Rosa how could he have discover'd  FIRELOCK  Do not be surprized I was inform'd of the whole affair by a very pretty girl at Signor Octavio's  ROSA  To LAURA  He means Alice  FIRELOCK  The same Sir She order'd me to engage in your service and I would no more disobey the commands of Beauty than the ar∣ticles of war  LAURA  Ha ha haPerhaps you have expectations of reward from your fair employer  FIRELOCK  Why look ye Madam Love and Honour have ever been my commanding officers and I should not deserve the name of their soldier if I wanted the inducement of reward to do my duty  LAURA  You have been bred a soldier I presume  FIRELOCK  No Madam I once had a pretty snug little estate which my wife and my friends obligingly help'd me soon to get rid of so as I was too honest or too proud to live by the same means as many of my neighbours I paid my debts as far as I could and took up a brown musquet The expectation of happier days has supported me through all my misfortunes and the an∣ticipation of social mirth has smiled on me even in the hour of battle  AIR  Fir'd with ardour to engage  The soldier dares the battle's rage  When groans which shall be heard no more  Echo to the cannon's roar  When the flying ranks are broke  And all is lost in clouds of smoke  Death stalks triumphant o'er the field  On every side the vanquish'd yield  And fainting victors scarcely live  Their dearbought laurels to receive  Still he blesses the hours when banishing care  He shall triumph again in the smiles of the fair  When wine wit and mirth shall Love's pleasures increase  And his laurels shall bloom with the olive of peace  ROSA  Here comes Aldobrand I vowWe must leave you  LAURA  Let me accompany you for I must have a few moments to prepare myself for the meeting  Exeunt  Enter MONTANO in the Friar's Habit with a SERVANT  SERVANT  If you'll sit down a moment my good father I'll acquaint Signora Laura that you are here  Exit  MONTANO  To what a dilemma have my ill stars reduc'd me My er∣rand here is to tempt that virtue which I hope to find superior to temptation "I must engage in a conflict where I dread to obtain the victory If she resists my importunities as Ibrahim it will at least afford me a satisfaction to find that though false to love she is yet true to virtue" But she comes  Enter LAURA  LAURA  Perhaps Signor Aldobrand you are not a little surpriz'd at my consenting to this interview  MONTANO  Aside  'Sdeath then she has really expected Aldobrand  "LAURA  "I can venture to assure you however that my motives for it are very different from what you may imagine I hope you will not misinterpret my conduct  "MONTANO  Aside  "No it seems to speak pretty plainly for itself"  LAURA  I rely entirely on your discretion  MONTANO  Aside  So it appearsAlas she don't seem to have made any use of her own indeed  LAURA  What can occasion his silence I am in a most aukward si∣tuationAaSir I understood that you had something of a particular nature to communicate  Aside  I hope Rosa will be at hand to relieve me  "MONTANO  Aside  "Perhaps she apprehends an interruption from her husband and means that I should fasten the door  Going to the Door  "LAURA  Stopping him  "That is not at all necessary you mayyou may venture to declare your sentiments to me freely  "MONTANO  Aside  "This is taking effectual care that I shan't misinterpret her indeed I shall never be able to contain myself"  ROSA  Peeping  I hear no screaming yet I fancy Laura has no reason to com∣plain of the violence of the old gentleman's passions  Retires  LAURA  You are still silent Signor Aldobrand  Aside  What the deuce can be the matter with the man  MONTANO kisses her Hand  Hold Sir this freedom is too much Can this be the wise prudent and discreet Aldobrand  MONTANO  Throwing open his Friar's Habit  No Madam 'tis the fond the faithful Ibrahim  LAURA  Ah I am betray'd and am fallen a victim to my own im∣prudence  Breaks from him and exit At the Moment ROSA enters on the opposite Side MONTANO wraps himself up in his Disguise  ROSA  Your servant good Signor Aldobrand I have caught you at last "Possibly you have assum'd this disguise in order to give Laura some intelligence of Ibrahim  "MONTANO  Aside  "He little thinks that he is so near the truth  "ROSA  "Or very likely you have resolved to make love in masque∣rade as it might not be quite convenient to appear in your own person  "MONTANO  Aside  "Right again The man has an admirable knack at guessing  "ROSA  "You see I am not ignorant of the person whom that dis∣guise conceals nor of the purpose for which it was assum'd  "MONTANO  Aside  "I'faith I rather perceive you are ignorant of it by your bullying in so high a stile"  ROSA  I find the Algerine is not yet taken that rogue who was to be hang'd drown'd flay'd and carbonaded You have let him escape after all your promises to imprison him in spite of law or equity  MONTANO  Aside  A pretty hair'sbreadth escape I have had  ROSA  But you have been bribed I doubt not that you are interested in his being at liberty  MONTANO  Aside  Rather so indeed  ROSA  And I am to be assassinated by him I dare say I am be∣trayed and that at this moment he knows that you issued the order for apprehending him at my request  MONTANO  Aside  Not till this moment did he know it good Signor Lucilio  ROSA  Not that I fear the arm of the haughty Moor could I but meet him face to face I only dread lest lurking under some disguise he may attack me at a moment when I am not prepar'd for I fancy my courage was never yet  brought in dispute  MONTANO  Aside  I dare believe not there can be but one opinion of it  ROSA  But not even the abject silence which guilt imposes on your tongue shall save you from my just revengeI have a very cu∣rious piece of steel here  Drawing her Sword  Enter FIRELOCK behind  MONTANO  And I believe I have just such another  Draws and discovers himself  FIRELOCK  And here's a third which I'll match with either of them  ROSA  Ibrahim  FIRELOCK  My friend the Algerine captain fighting in ambuscade  MONTANO  The sameBut perhaps Signor Lucilio this is one of your unprepar'd moments  ROSA  IIam not yet prepar'd for you indeed SirYouyou are safe  Putting up her Sword  Aldobrand must be the first victim of my vengeance  MONTANO  Pitiful boy draw instantly Are these the evasions  ROSA  I am not to be frighten'd SirII shall not fight at pre∣sent True courage Sir like minealways calmalways calm I sayand intrepid looks down Sir with contempt on the impotent attacks ofofof maliceandand in short SirII shall find another time to see you  Exit  FIRELOCK  I am not sorry he has escap'd you such a conquest would have disgraced your sword  MONTANO  And this is the being for whom Laura has quitted me But I'll think no more of itEre I quit Florence for ever the vil∣lainy of this Aldobrand in perverting the laws to his unworthy purposes shall be punished He is a traitor to his country who tamely beholds her laws and liberties invaded either by the as∣sassin hand of knavery or the bolder attacks of tyranny  AIR  Accurs'd the wretch whose coward soul  Aw'd by Oppression's guilty hand  Dares not the lawless power controul  Which drives fair Freedom from the land  Who deaf to Honour's call sublime  Tamely to tyranny submits  Becomes th' accomplice in the crime  And shares the treason he permits  Exit  SCENE ALDOBRAND's House  MONTANO's Algerine Habit and Turban lying on a Chair  Enter VIOLA  VIOLA  Alas how suddenly have I been awaken'd from my dream of bliss How unexpected the reverse But a moment ago I seem'd to be treading the paths of happiness and whither have they led me Yet does not Hope desert me I will caress the kind guest and like a drowning wretch still continue to clasp him while I seem to be irrecoverably sinking  AIR  Thus we view the treach'rous morning  With false smiles the hills adorning  Tho' of storms they give no warning  Yet no sooner seen than gone  Still while clouds on clouds impelling  The storm drives on with ruin swelling  Fancy every cloud dispelling  Paints tomorrow's happy dawn  Enter ALDOBRAND and ALICE  ALDOBRAND  Once more I bid you welcome home my young MadamWhy you made but a short visit to your loverEgad ne and I have been playing the English game of cricket with you I bowl you at him he bats you back again to me you come plump into my hands so he is caught out and there is an end of the gameGo to your chamber and study the charms of retirement  Exit VIOLA  ALICE  Well Sir I am quite impatient to hear your success with Laura  ALDOBRAND  Aside  Ah the cockatriceBut I'll dissembleDon't mention her Alice I have had enough of gallantry the very name is poison to my earsa pistol to my heada dagger to my breast  Enter FABIO  FABIO  Signora Laura is below  ALDOBRAND  IndeedWhywhythere is great condescension in her vi∣siting meI'll wait on her  ALICE  What Sir would you put the steel to your breast  ALDOBRAND  Ah Alice if it be steel it is certainly touched with a loadstone for I am irresistibly drawn to it though I dread it's point  Exeunt ALDOBRAND and FABIO  ALICE  Poor Viola thus to be awakened in a fright from her dream of happinessBut I'll assist her to fit the old dotard yet  Enter MONTANO in the Friar's Habit  Bless me Signor Aldobrand can I believe my eyes Why I parted with you but this moment and now I see you in the very dress  MONTANO  Discovering himself  Which was intended as Aldobrand's passport to LauraI have done with it my dear and am come for my own cloaths  Throws aside the Friar's Dress and puts on the Turban c  ALICE  Are not you the Algerine captain who behaved so kindly to the poor slavesI am sure you must be a good Christian in your heart  MONTANO retires while ALDOBRAND enters  ALDOBRAND  Alice give orders that my doors be instantly shut against that ruffian IbrahimHere is poor Lucilio come to claim my protection he and Laura are afraid to trust themselves in their own houseThat fellow is born to be the plague of my life wherever I go I am sure to meet him  MONTANO  Coming forward  I understand that you have issued an order to apprehend me good Signor  ALICE  Aside  I hope the captain will give him a sound beatingI'll go and keep the servants out of hearing  Exit  MONTANO  I mean to surrender myself to Justice if necessary but I fear though you call yourself her representative you do not speak the  voice of your constituent but are like a bad inn which pro∣mises good accommodation on its sign while there is nothing but extortion within  ALDOBRAND  How dare you thus affront a magistrate  MONTANO  Miscreant do not rouze my anger or by all your villanies I swear  ALDOBRAND  Help help  Enter ROSA  MONTANO  But I beg pardon your life is that gentleman's property he has sworn to dispatch  you  before he fights  me  ALDOBRAND  I'll give up my turn with all my soul  ROSA  Signor Aldobrand pay no attention to the idle dreams of a madman  MONTANO  Well if you will have them dreams I dreamt that under this disguise  Taking up the Friar's Dress  I believe we are all three acquainted with itunder this disguise I say the seducing gallant Aldobrand meant to attempt the chastity of that gen∣tleman's wife  ROSA  Angrily  How Signor Aldobrand  MONTANO  And that the brave and noble Lucilio conniving at the de∣signs of this youthful ravisher lay in wait for him to take ad∣vantage of his cowardice  ALDOBRAND  How Signor LucilioAnd who the devil told you all this  MONTANO  There is my author who also while I was disguis'd as a friar informed me of your kind intention not only to imprison but to hang drown flay and carbonade meI think those were your words Signor AldobrandI make no ceremony gentle∣men in acquainting you with each other's rascality I am per∣suaded you are both too much of the poltroon for me to appre∣hend any bloodshed between you  ALDOBRAND  Very pretty upon my soulThey seem to be excellent com∣pany so I'll e'en leave them together  Exit  ROSA  Yes yes I shall remember thisBut I must keep down my passion  AIR  Good Sir in vain you bend your brow  And look so queer I know not how  And set your arms akimbo  My laughter you provoke  Ha ha ha ha  So pleasant is the joke  If Sir I chose to try my skill  Of fencing soon you'd have your fill  But mighty Signor Whiskers  With you I won't engage  Ha ha ha ha  A fig for all your rage  Nay pr'ythee friend don't draw your sword  I shan't draw mine upon my word  Nor could I fight for laughing  Were I to look at you  Ha ha ha ha  And so sweet Sir adieu  MONTANO going meets OCTAVIO  OCTAVIO  My friend my Montano how happy your presence makes meThen my Viola is safeMy visit here at this time will prevent Aldobrand's suspecting the scheme by which he is de∣priv'd of his prey  MONTANO  Aside  He must mean my personating Aldobrand at Laura's How could it have reach'd his ears  OCTAVIO  Tell me Montano how did she look what did she say Relate every circumstance  MONTANO  Why when I first entered the house she took me for Aldo∣brand  OCTAVIO  Took you for AldobrandHa ha ha A ridiculous mis∣take and no great compliment to you neitherWell did she not often call upon Octavio  MONTANO  No she never mention'd your name  OCTAVIO  That's strange  MONTANO  Her tongue faltering with conscious guilt  OCTAVIO  Conscious guilt What a strange phrase for the amiable ti∣midity of the sexBut proceed  MONTANO  Just as I caught her in my arms  OCTAVIO  What  MONTANO  Her husband rush'd into the room and surpriz'd us  OCTAVIO  Her husbandWhat husbandI talk to you of my Viola the lovely charge whom I entrusted to you not two hours ago  MONTANO  Viola entrusted to meWhy my dear friend either you or I must have lost our wits for I don't recollect that I ever saw the lady in my life  OCTAVIO  I am in tormentOh Viola  Enter REGNALTO hastily  REGNALTO  She is now in the house Alice by your own orders gave her into the hands of Aldobrand who by some unaccountable ac∣cident was dress'd like Ibrahim  MONTANO  Rather whimsical in you to mistake Aldobrand for me and no great compliment to me neither as you say  To OCTAVIO  REGNALTO  It is not too late to retrieve every thingSignor Ibrahim you must not be seen here wait near the gardengate your friend Octavio will need your services  MONTANO  Well Octavio take care you

slaveryHa  OCTAVIO  Why you seem surpriz'd you  ALDOBRAND  My joy overcomes methat's all  OCTAVIO  He is soon to make his appearance in Florence  ALDOBRAND  I should be heartily glad to see him  Aside  At the de∣vil But pray how did you hear this news  OCTAVIO  My lacquey had it this moment from Regnalto's servant Laurence who is his old acquaintance  ALDOBRAND  Aside  I'm in a cold chill Regnalto's servant in Florence  OCTAVIO  In your house at this moment  ALDOBRAND  In my houseRun Fabio and bring him hither immedi∣atelyMy old friend's servant to be under my roof and I not know it  Exit FABIO  OCTAVIO  It rather seems as if he meant to conceal himself from you  ALDOBRAND  Egad that's very true as you sayPerhaps the dog may have robb'd his master and when he finds himself discover'd he may make off I had better go and see after him myself There are so many rogues in the world  Exit  OCTAVIO  To REGNALTO  Tell me what means  REGNALTO  Ask me no questions They believe me dumb still let them think so  OCTAVIO  The charming Viola  REGNALTO  Accepts the offer which your letter convey'd to her I will assist in her elopement and have a ladder of ropes ready placed at the balcony in the garden  OCTAVIO  TransportAnd this news of Regnalto  REGNALTO  Is trueBut here comes Aldobrand  OCTAVIO  Then we must not be seen togetherThe garden at twelve  REGNALTO  Depend on me  Exit  Enter ALDOBRAND  ALDOBRAND  Aye there's that dog Laurence sure enoughBut there's no fear of his running away he is so tipsy he can hardly stand  OCTAVIO  You must feel a singular satisfaction at the approaching return of your old friend Regnalto  ALDOBRAND  A very singular satisfaction indeedI never felt any thing like it before  Enter LAURENCE drunk and FABIO  OCTAVIO  Is that Regnalto's servant  ALDOBRAND  He himself Sir  LAURENCE  There you are mistaken for I am not myself at present  OCTAVIO  And your master  LAURENCE  Like man like master he is not himself neither But we shall come to ourselves both of us before tomorrow morning  ALDOBRAND  Where is your master  Aside  I sit on pins and needles  LAURENCE  My master is at home  ALDOBRAND  At home  LAURENCE  And yet he is not at homebecause the people make a stran∣ger of him  ALDOBRAND  Is he in Florence  LAURENCE  How can I tell I hardly know where I am myself and if I did I would not tell you for to speak the truth I

month you would certainly have horns"  Exit  ALDOBRAND  Signor Octavio you'll pardon my reminding you that it is very late  OCTAVIO  I understand you Signor and as it is near my hour I'll take my leave  ALDOBRAND  Good night sweet Signor  Exit OCTAVIO  Fabio I don't know whether I am upon my head or my heels This Reg∣nalto is certainly in Florence and then I don't like what that drunken fellow said to Octavio about Viola's walking in the gar∣den I fear there is some mischief stirring Tell Guiseppe and Roberto to get their carbines and we'll take a walk round the garden Signor Lucilio too shall join our companyI am al∣ways most valiant when I am best supported  Exeunt  SCENE the Garden  A Ladder of Ropes fix'd to the Balcony  Enter MONTANO  MONTANO  This I think is the spot where Octavio appointed me to stand guardAlas if my endeavours for my friend's happiness are crown'd with no better success than those for my ownBut I hear voices  Retreating to the Back of the Scene  Enter LAURA and ROSA  ROSA  I wish we could see some one appear at the window that we might apprize Viola of her danger  LAURA  Happy Viola to love and be beloved while I have lavish'd my affection on an ingrate who perhaps at this very moment amuses a happy mistress with the fond tale of my weakness  AIR  Hope on thee I call  While thro' thy paths I stray  Where'er my footsteps fall  Oh light me on my way  Tho' lost in Error's maze  Still kindly soothe my woe  Nor let Truth's brighter blaze  Shew what I fear to know  ROSA  Think no more of your false lover Madam Take my ad∣vice and from among

Drawing his Sword  LAURA  Oh my dear girl  MONTANO  Aside  How a girl  LAURA  How continually has my tongue dwelt on it's dearest themethe praises of my Montano  MONTANO  Aside  MontanoDo I live  LAURA  But it is all over RosaI will retire from a world which has lost it's only charm for me a convent shall  MONTANO  This excess of joy is too much  LAURA  Hark  ROSA  It is the voice of Ibrahim  MONTANO  No it is a voice with which the gentle Laura should be bet∣ter acquainted a voice which during four cruel years of slavery has never ceased to invoke Heaven for her happiness  LAURA  Oh Rosa it isit is my Montano  Faints in his Arms  ROSA  And so ends my first chapter of matrimonyA very excel∣lent mode of getting rid of a wife without the trouble of a di∣vorce or the expence of a separate maintenanceHow many poor husbands would envy meBut my dear Madamand Siryou forget that this is a moment as critical to Viola as to yourselves and I hear footsteps in the garden  MONTANO  Let us retire then my love From this arbour I can watch whether any one approaches the balcony  Enter LAURENCE still drunk with a Bottle in his Hand  LAURENCE  'Tis rather a dark night or else I don't see clear  AIR  Tho' I can't walk quite straight  And in figures of eight  Still circling my legs do their duty  You'll always observe  That a regular curve  Is reckon'd the true line of beauty  Of Orpheus they tell  He who fiddled so well  That his notes made hills rocks and trees caper  So I can in my way  When a solo I play  Make them dance full as well as that scraper  Tho' at first on a survey  Things seem topseyturvey  When you're us'd to't they don't look so frightful  Still they move more or less  And good judges confess  Moving prospects are always delightful  The world's circular motion  I'm sure's no false notion  For tho' sober I ne'er could believe it  Truth in wine boys is found  Now I see it turns round  He that's drunk can most plainly perceive it  I wonder where my master is As for old Aldobrand I sup∣pose he is in bed and asleep  Enter ALDOBRAND and FABIO at the Back of the Stage they approach LAURENCE softly  But I can't think what's become of my good friend Dummy as they call himAh Sir are you there I have been looking for you all over the gardenWhat not come to your speech yetI'faith I think you have infected me for I have not my speech half so well as I had a little while agoWhere is  Signor OctavioYou don't stand still What makes you stagger soWhy don't you answer me Sir Old Aldobrand can't hear us now  ALDOBRAND seizes him on one Side FABIO on the other

I were to personate Regnalto his cloaths fit me exactly and I might by that means further your designs  OCTAVIO  Not at the expence of my honour I will not owe my success to artifice  REGNALTO  Psha a little artifice is often very useful 'tis only retreating from an enemy when he is too powerful for us and a good pair of heels is sometimes very serviceableEh friend Fire∣lock  FIRELOCK  A good pair of heels may be as useful to a coward as ar∣tifice is to a knave but honesty as much despises the aid of the one as courage disdains the assistance of the other  REGNALTO  Viola approaches  Enter VIOLA and ALICE from a Door under the Balcony  OCTAVIO  My Viola  VIOLA  What a transition from despair to happinessOctavio I commit myself to your honour  OCTAVIO  Charming Viola my affection shall

forget my  first husband  Pointing to ROSA  ROSA  Believe me I shall not forget your second as long as I live I am sure I found it so hard a task to personate the husband  LAURENCE  That I suppose the
