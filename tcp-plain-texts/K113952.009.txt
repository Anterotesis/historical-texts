POETICAL CALENDAR  SEPTEMBER AN ODE  FArewell the pomp of Flora vivid scene  Welcome sage Autumn to invert the year  Farewell to summer's eyedelighting green  Her verdure fadesautumnal blasts are near  The silky wardrobe now is laid aside  With all the rich regalia of her pride  And must we bid sweet Philomel adieu  She that was wont to charm us in the grove  Must Nature's livery wear a sadder hue  And a dark canopy be stretch'd above  Yesfor September mounts his ebonthrone  And the smooth foliage of the plain is gone  Libra to weigh the harvest's pearly store  The golden ballance poizes now on high  The calm serenity of Zephyr o'er  Sol's glittering legions to th' equator fly  At the same hour he shows his orient head  And warn'd by Thetis sinks in Ocean's bed  Adieu ye damask roses which remind  The maiden fairone how her charms decay  Ye rising blasts oh leave some mark behind  Some small memorial of the sweets of May  Ah nothe ruthless season will not hear  Nor spare one glory of the ruddy year  No more the waste of music sung so late  From every bush green orchestre of love  For now their winds the birds of passage wait  And bid a last farewell to every grove  While those whom shepherdswains the sleepers call  Chuse their recess in some sequester'd wall  Yet still shall sage September boast his pride  Some birds shall chant some gayer flowers shall blow  Nor is the season wholly unallied  To purple bloom the haler fruits shall grow  The stronger plants such as enjoy the cold  And wear a livelier grace by being old  AN AUTUMNAL ODEâ–ª  TO MR HAYMAN  YET once more glorious God of day  While beams thine orb serene  O let me warbling court thy stay  To gild the fading scene  Thy rays invigorate the Spring  Bright Summer to perfection bring  The cold inclemency of Winter cheer  And make th' Autumnal months the mildest of the year  Ere yet the russet foliage fall  I'll climb the mountain's brow  My friend my Hayman at thy call  To view the scene below  How sweetly pleasing to behold  Forests of vegetable gold  How mix'd the many chequer'd shades between  The tawny mellowing hue and the gay vivid green  How splendid all the sky how still  How mild the dying gale  How soft the whispers of the rill  That winds along the vale  So tranquil Nature's works appear  It seems the sabbath of the year  As if the Summer's labour past she chose  This season's sober calm for blandishing repose  Such is of wellspent life the time  When busy days are past  Man verging gradual from his prime  Meets sacred peace at last  His flowery Spring of pleasures o'er  And Summer's fullblown pride no more  He gains pacific Autumn mild and bland  And dauntless braves the stroke of Winter's palsied hand  For yet a while a little while  Involv'd in wintry gloom  And lo another Spring shall smile  A Spring eternal bloom  Then shall he shine a glorious guest  In the bright mansions of the blest  Where due rewards on virtue are bestow'd  And reap'd the golden fruits of what his Autumn sow'd  AUTUMN AN ODE  ALas with swift and silent pace  Impatient Time rolls on the year  The seasons change and Nature's face  Now sweetly smiles now frowns severe  'Twas spring 'twas summer all was gay  Now autumn bends a cloudy brow  The flowers of spring are swept away  And summer's fruits desert the bough  The verdant leaves that play'd on high  And wanton'd in the western breeze  Now trod in dust neglected lie  As Boreas strips the bending trees  The fields that wav'd with golden grain  As russet heaths are wild and bare  Not moist with dew but drench'd in rain  Nor health nor pleasure wanders there  No more while thro' the midnight shade  Beneath the moon's pale orb I stray  Soft pleasing woes my heart invade  As Progne pours the melting lay  From this capricious clime she soars  O would some God but wings supply  To where each morn the spring restores  Companion of her flight I'd fly  Vain wish me fate compells to bear  The downward season's iron reign  Compells to breathe polluted air  And shiver on a blasted plain  What bliss to life can autumn yield  If glooms and showers and storms prevail  And Ceres flies the naked field  And flowers and fruits and Phoebus fail  Oh what remains what lingers yet  To cheer me in the darkening hour  The grape remains the friend of wit  In love and mirth of mighty power  Haste press the clusters fill the bowl  Apollo shoot thy parting ray  This gives the sunshine of the soul  This God of health and verse and day  Still still the jocund strain shall flow  The pulse with vigorous rapture beat  My Stella with new charms shall glow  And every bliss in wine shall meet  AUTUMN  BY MR BREREWOOD  THo' the seasons must alter ah yet let me find  What all must confess to be rare  A female still cheerful and faithful and kind  The blessings of autumn to share  Let one side of our cottage a flourishing vine  Overspread with its branches and shade  Whose clusters appear more transparent and fine  As its leaves are beginning to fade  When the fruit makes the branches bend down with its load  In our orchard surrounded with pales  In a bed of clean straw let our apples be stow'd  For a tart that in winter regales  When the vapours that rise from the earth in the morn  Seem to hang on its surface like smoke  'Till dispers'd by the sun that gilds over the corn  Within doors let us prattle and joke  But when we see clear all the hues of the leaves  And at work in the fields are all hands  Some in reaping the wheat others binding the sheaves  Let us carelesly strole o'er the lands  How pleasing the sight of the toiling they make  To collect what kind Nature has sent  Heaven grant we may not of their labour partake  But oh give us their happy content  And sometimes on a bank under shade by a brook  Let us silently sit at our ease  And there gaze on the stream till the fish on the hook  Struggles hard to procure its release  And now when the husbandman sings harvest home  And the corn's all got into the house  When the long wish'd for time of their meeting is come  To frolic and feast and carouse  When the leaves from the trees are begun to be shed  And are leaving the branches all bare  Either strew'd at the roots shrivell'd wither'd and dead  Or else blown to and fro in the air  When the ways are so miry that bogs they might seem  And the axletree's ready to break  While the waggoner whistles in stopping his team  And then claps the poor jades on the neck  In the morning let's follow the cry of the hounds  Or the fearful young covey beset  Which tho' skulking in stubble and weeds on the grounds  Are becoming a prey to the net  Let's enjoy all the pleasure retirement affords  Still amus'd with these innocent sports  Nor once envy the pomp of fine ladies and lords  With their grand entertainments in courts  In the evening when lovers are leaning on stiles  Deep engag'd in some amorous chat  And 'tis very well known by his grin and her smiles  What they both have a mind to be at  To our dwelling tho' homely wellpleas'd to repair  Let our mutual endearments revive  And let no single action or look but declare  How contented and happy we live  Should ideas arise that may ruffle the soul  Let soft music the phantoms remove  For 'tis harmony only has force to controul  And unite all the passions in love  With her eyes but half open her cap all awry  When the lass is preparing for bed  And the sleepy dull clown who sits nodding just by  Sometimes rouzes and scratches his head  In the night when 'tis cloudy and rainy and dark  And the labourers snore as they lie  Not a noise to disturb us unless a dog bark  In the farm or the village hard by  At the time of sweet rest and of quiet like this  Ere our eyes are clos'd up in their lids  Let us welcome the season and taste of that bliss  Which the sunshine and daylight forbids  UPON MY HAIRS FALLING  FEW and easy in your stay  Never curl'd and hardly grey  Hairs adieu tho' falling all  Blameless harmless may you fall  Light and trifling tho' you be  More deserving poetry  Than the dream of guilty power  Than the miser's gather'd ore  Than the world's most serious things  Murdering victors haughty kings  If your moral fall presage  Death the certain end of age  If a single hint you give  Well to die and soon to live  AN EVENING ODE TO DELIA  EVening now from purple wings  Sheds the grateful gifts she brings  Brilliant drops bedeck the mead  Cooling breezes shake the reed  Shake the reed and curl the stream  Silver'd o'er with Cynthia's beam  Near the chequer'd lonely grove  Hears and keeps thy secrets love  Thither Delia let us stray  Lightly o'er the dewy way  Phoebus drives his burning car  Hence my lovely Delia far  In his stead the queen of night  Sheds around a lambent light  Light that serves but just to show  Breasts that beat and cheeks that glow  Let us there in whisper'd joy  All the silent hours employ  Silence best and dusky shades  Please the heart that love invades  Other passions then at rest  Love possesses all the breast  REFLECTIONS ON A WATCH  LET vain Philosophy hence learn to bind  The lawless operations of the mind  And teach us to obey that Power unseen  That fram'd and first inform'd our wise machine  Then shall we know what schools have idly taught  To guide each act and regulate each thought  Like this mechanic wonder shall we move  Unvaried by ambition anger love  Constant in each vicissitude of care  Not urg'd by hope nor yet repress'd by fear  Alike in health disease in age or youth  Our equal judgment still will point at truth  No longer shall we live whole years in vain  Nor one sad hour be mark'd with grief or pain  Freedom and joy our measur'd time will fill  Guiltless unerring and assur'd our will  'Till the last pulse shall beat and life stand still  AUTUMN  I At my window sit and see  Autumn his russet fingers lay  On every leaf of every tree  I call but Summer will not stay  She flies the boasting Goddess flies  And pointing where th' espaliers shoot  " Deserve my parting gift she cries  " I take the leaves but not the fruit"  Let me the parting gift improve  And emulate the just reply  As life's short seasons swift remove  Ere fix'd in winter's frost I lie  Health beauty vigour now decline  The pride of summer's splendid day  Leaves which the stem must now resign  The mournful prelude of decay  But let fair virtue's fruit remain  Tho' summer with my leaves be fled  Then not despis'd I'll not complain  But cherish autumn in her stead  THE FIRESIDE  A PARODY ON THE SECOND EPODE OF HORACE  BY ISAAC HAWKINS BROWNE ESQ  " THrice happy who free from ambition and pride  In a rural retreat has a quiet fireside  I love my fireside thither let me repair  And drink a delightful oblivion of care  Oh when shall I 'scape to be truly my own  From the noise and the smoke and the bustle of town  Then I live then I triumph whene'er I retire  From the pomp and parade that the many admire  Hail ye woods and ye lawns shady vales sunny hills  And the warble of birds and the murmur of rills  Ye flowers of all hues that embroider the ground  Flocks feeding or frisking in gambols around  Scene of joy to behold joy that who would forego  For the wealth and the power that a court can bestow  I have said it at home I have said it abroad  That the town is man's world but that this is of God  Here my trees cannot flatter plants nurs'd by my care  Pay with fruit or with fragrance and incense the air  Here contemplative solitude raises the mind  Least alone when alone to ideas refin'd  Methinks hid in groves which no sound can invade  Save when Philomel strikes up her sweet serenade  I revolve on the changes and chances of things  And pity the wretch that attends upon kings  Now I pass with old authors an indolent hour  And reclining at ease turn Demosthenes o'er  Now facetious and vacant I urge the gay flask  With a sett of old friendswho have nothing to ask  Thus happy I reck not of France nor of Spain  Nor the balance of power what hand shall sustain  The balance of power ha till that is restor'd  What solid delight can retirement afford  Some must be content to be drudges of state  That the Sage may securely enjoy his retreat  In weather serene when the ocean is calm  It matters not much who presides at the helm  But soon as clouds gather and tempests arise  Then a pilot there needs a man dauntless and wise  If such can be found sure he ought to come forth  And lend to the public his talents and worth  Whate'er inclination or ease may suggest  If the state wants his aid he has no claim to rest  But who is the man a bad game to redeem  He whom Savoy admires who has Prussia's esteem  Whom the Spaniards have felt and whose iron with dread  Haughty Lewis saw forging to fall on his head  Holland loves him nor less in the North all the powers  Court honour revere and the Empress adores  Hark what was that sound for it seem'd more sublime  Than befits the low genius of pastoral rhime  Was it Wisdom I heard or can fumes of the brain  Cheat my ears with a dream ha repeat me that strain  Yes Wisdom I hear thee thou deign'st to declare  Me me the sole Atlas to prop this whole sphere  Thy voice says or seems in sweet accents to say  Haste and save sinking BritainResign'd I obey  And O witness ye powers that Ambition and Pride  Have no share in this changefor I love my FireSide"  Thus the Shepherd then throwing his crook away steals  Direct to St James's and takes up the seals  THE DRYADS OR WOODNYMPHS  A PHILOSOPHICAL POEM  BY MR DIAPER  Bacchum in remotis carmina rupibus  Vidi docentem credite posteri  Nymphasque discentes et aures  Capripedum Satyrorum acutas  Evae recenti mens trepidat metu  HOR  FOrgive ye Nereids if I sing no more  The uncertain sea but choose the safer shore  And leave the restless waves for steady hills  To sit on grassy plots or dream by rills  The wanton muse the meaner thorn prefers  To coral twigs and amber's costly tears  Again I may when tir'd of leavy woods  Haste to the sea and court the rolling floods  No lov'd amusement's here but soon will cloy  The dearest bliss becomes a worthless toy  And we must shift our pleasures to enjoy  Sick of the town I left the busy place  Where deep concern broods on the thoughtful face  Where factious cits with nods and roguish leer  Are whispering nothing in attentive ear  Where knaves strange lies invent and fools retail  And homemade treason find in every mail  Falshoods their credit gain tho' illcontriv'd  And scandals oft disprov'd are still reviv'd  Imagin'd ills in frightful shapes appear  While present evils we with patience bear  Phantoms and empty forms are fear'd the most  As those who scorn'd the man yet dread the ghost  No longer plagued with faction spleen and noise  How was I bless'd when first my ravish'd eyes  Suck'd in the purer day and saw unclouded skies  How happy when I view'd the calm retreat  And groves o'erlook'd by Winchcomb's antient seat  Here the smooth  A river in Barkshire  Kennet takes his doubtful way  In wanton rounds the lingering waters play  And by their circling streams prolong the grateful stay  Here good old Chaucer whilom cheer'd the vale  And sootely sung and told the jocund tale  Bright was the moon and her reflected beams  Spangled the dewy leaves with trembling gleams  While stars by conscious twinklings seem'd to know  What waking lovers acted here below  Careless I walk'd where prowling beasts had made  A path that led thro' a lone silent glade  The moon with doubtful rays deceiv'd the sight  And waving boughs gave an uncertain light  When my chill'd spirits sunk with sudden fear  And trembling horror bid the search forbear  My heedless steps had touch'd the hallow'd ground  Where airy demons dance the wanton round  Where fairy elves and midnight Dryads meet  And to the moon the sylvan song repeat  Tall rifted oaks and circling elms had made  A central void amidst surrounding shade  With hollow vaulted cells and rising heaps  In which by day the wearied badger sleeps  Thick thorny brakes grew round the lonesome place  And twining boughs enclos'd the middle space  Here Dryads in nocturnal revels join  While stars thro' shaking leaves obscurely shine  And here I saw bless'd with a kinder fate  Where in a beauteous ring the nymphs were sate  Wellpleas'd the Elfins smil'd but she who guards  Pomaceous fruits and orchardcares rewards  Down pensive lean'd her head no ruddy streaks  Mixt with the languid paleness of her cheeks  Cast on the ground her wither'd garland lay  Whose shrivell'd leaves seem'd conscious of decay  Thyrsis that muchlov'd youth the goddess mourn'd  Thyrsis who once Silurian plains adorn'd  The rural powers confess'd their meaner lays  When Thyrsis sung and own'd his juster praise  He Ariconian swains industrious taught  To strain rich must and press the racy draught  Since he is gone the trees are all decay'd  With moss bedight and blossoms illarray'd  The pensive owner mourns the tedious weeks  And wants the generous bowl that paints the flushing cheeks  Men led by sense and partial to themselves  Nor roving demons own nor wandering elves  But who can know th' intelligible race  Or guess the powers that fill th' aerial space  Oft the tir'd horse is forc'd to scour the plain  When Fairies ride fix'd in his twisted mane  And I ye Gods have wondrous circles seen  Where wanton sprites in midnight dance have been  And press'd their rounding steps on every newmow'd green  Ye demons who in lonely forests rove  And friendly powers that human arts improve  Ye careful Genii that o'er men preside  Direct their counsels and their actions guide  The grateful Muse shall your assistance own  And tell of heavenly forms as yet unknown  Bless'd beings whom no earthy fetters bind  Nor to the pressing weight of clay confin'd  Of unmixt ether form'd their beauty fears  No pale disease nor change of coming years  Be kind ye powers and tune my artless tongue  While I repeat the Dryads pleasing song  NapÃ© began a nymph with careless mien  Clad like autumnal leaves in yellowish green  Her round plump cheeks a deeper purple dy'd  Such as ripe fruits boast on their sunny side  A wreath of platted moss curl'd round her head  Cheerful she smil'd and thus the Elfin said  " Tall sycamores the noisy insects love  And buzzing round the leaves incessant move  While the day lasts the worthless creatures play  And mourn the evening dusk and wing their silent way  But forest nymphs prefer the peaceful night  When solemn gloom and dewy seats invite  While drowzy man in sleep unactive rests  Not half so happy as the watchful beasts  Who silent leave their dens and secret home  And on the prey intent thro' all the forest roam  The raging sun with his too scorching beams  Burns up the herbs and lessens all the streams  But the kind moon reflects a milder ray  And makes a night more lovely than the day  Nor darts fierce flame but innocently bright  Leaves all the fire and gives the purer light  No noisome vapour or dark cloud exhales  But gentle drops fresh dews and pleasing gales  So woman is but rougher man refin'd  Has nought of him that's fierce but all that's kind  Now falling drops like shining pearls are seen  And dewy spangles hang on every green  Refreshing moisture cools the thirsty mead  Extends the stalk and swells th'unfolded seed  Restores the verdure of the tarnish'd leaves  And every herb the ripening juice receives  Day always is the same but wanton night  Boasts a more grateful change of harmless light  Below the glowworms wondrous orbs are seen  That stud with burnish'd gold the shaded green  These little wandering comets never shed  Or baneful ill or dire contagion spread  Their shining tails foretel no falling state  Nor future dearth nor sad disease create  Bright lambent flames and kindled vapours rise  Sweep glaring thro' the dusk and strike the wondering eyes  In oblique tracks the meteors blaze around  And skim the surface of the marshy ground  Unseen by day when tyrantlike the sun  Envious admits no splendor but his own  The liquid drops that ooze from weeping trees  And sparkling stones with starlike lustre please  Even sapless wood improv'd by age grows bright  And what it wants in moisture gains in light  While ripen'd fruits and milder seasons last  And only empty clouds the skies o'ercast  Nymphs in lone deserts chant the rural lay  'Till the wing'd Hours bring on returning day  But when fierce wintery storms the forest rend  And rattling hail or fleecy snows descend  When conscious birds who know succeeding times  Haste from the cold and seek for milder climes  The Elfin powers who can at pleasure leave  Aerial bodies and new forms receive  Cast off their vehicles and freed from sense  Nor dread the storms nor cold when too intense  The earthy Gnomes and Fairy Elves are seen  Digging in lowest mines with busy men  There labour on the fruitless work intent  While deeper snows the wonted dance prevent  But foolish swains the blooming Spring prefer  The infant glory of the budding year  Nature as yet is but imperfect seen  And her weak products show a rawish green  The flowers look gay but lovely Autumn treats  With ripen'd beauties and substantial sweets  Nor wants its flowers while poppies grace the corn  And azure cups the waving fields adorn  Fruits lov'd by rustic tastes of pleasing show  On the wild hedge and scented briar grow  And yellow leaves the fairy Elfin's bed  Fly with the wind and on the ground are spread  The frisking Satyrs squeeze the cluster'd grape  And the chaste Dryad fears the coming rape  Ripe mellow heaps from every tree are shook  And bending corn expects the sharpen'd hook  Soon will the nodding sheaves be borne away  And the drawn net inclose th' unguarded prey  The friendly powers who labouring peasants aid  Nymphs and lightfawns frequent the woody shade  But oft curs'd fiends quit their infernal home  And hated guests in gloomy forests roam  With glaring eyes affright the howling beasts  And little birds shrink closer in their nests  Earth would be heaven if we might here enjoy  Pleasure unmixt and leave the base alloy  The greatest good has its attending ill  And doubtful bliss distracts th' uncertain will  So teeming Autumn boasts her luscious fruits  And plants of grateful taste and healing roots  But ripens with like care the growing seeds  Of baneful aconite and noxious weeds  The deadly nightshade wanton youth deceives  With shining berries and with spreading leaves  Th' accursed fruit invites with pleasing show  Fair as the damsen or the skydy'd sloe  But ah not rashly trust the tempting ills  Too well you know that beauty often kills  Swift thro' the bones the spreading venom flies  A deadly sleep hangs on his closing eyes  And the lost wretch in raging frenzy dies  Now round its pole the spiral hop entwists  Like Thyrsi borne by Bacchus' antient priests  The husband elm supports th' embracing vines  And round its oak the ivy closer twines  To Bacchus sacred all and prone to love  They show what fuel must the flame improve  Love blind himself the mark would hardly know  But Bacchus takes the aim and sets the bow  Autumnal days a constant medium boast  Nor chap the ground with heat nor dry with frost  Nature on all her finish'd labour smiles  And the glad peasant reaps the grateful spoils  Winds shake the ripen'd seeds on parent earth  And thus impregnate for succeeding birth  The tufted cod with future harvest swells  While weighty seeds fall from their native cells  And near their motherstem but smaller kinds  Far from their homes are borne by sweeping winds  The atoms fly wafted on every breeze  Hence mossy threads enwrap the tallest trees  Herbs of strange forms on highest rocks are found  And spreading fern runs o'er the barren ground  But Goddess you neglect your wonted care  While blighted orchards mourn the nymphs despair  Nor love as once to see the handed bowls  When tipling rustics cheer their droughty souls  And tread with faltring steps th' unequal ground  While humble cots with wayward mirth resound  Succeeding bards in rural secrets skill'd  Shall teach the swain t' enrich the barren field  The prophet's inspiration never ends  But with a double portion still descends  Poets like rightful kings can never die  Heaven's sacred ointment will the throne supply  And Tityrus when he draws his latest breath  Will to some darling youth the valued pipe bequeath  So tuneful insects fed by morning dew  Who in warm meads the daily song renew  True poets they laugh at approaching want  And careless sing and mock the labouring ant  But soon bleak colds the wanton throng surprize  And the whole race ah too unpitied dies  And yet returning heat and sultry days  Restore the species and new songsters raise  The Goddess will not long forget her care  But loss of fruit with future crops repair  No more shall blasting winds the harvest grieve  Or blighted buds autumnal hopes deceive  The youth wellpleas'd will daily thanks repeat  While loaden branches groan beneath their weight  As from salt waves are drawn the sweeter rains  And cheerful streams that swell the fatten'd plains  So from our griefs succeeding pleasures flow  Grafted on crabs the fairest apples grow  Bitters and sweets in the same cup are thrown  And prickly thistles have the softest down"  Thus said the nymph and Psecas thus replied  Psecas who gives the herbs their various pride  She Nature aids and is the sylvan power  That shapes the leaf and paints the woody flower  She blanches lillies to their loveliest white  Whose skinlike beauty pleases human sight  Hence the blue vervains grace the humble shade  And drowzy poppies are in scarlet clad  Unerring forms the growing plant receives  She rounds the stem and points th' indented leaves  " Who said the nymph would sing of bleating flocks  Or hanging goats that browze on craggy rocks  When antient bards have rifled all the store  And the drain'd subject can afford no more  Nor Cuddy now nor Colin would engage  Eclogue but ill becomes a warlike age  In antient times the shepherd's song would please  When pious kings enjoy'd the shepherd's ease  And monarchs sat beneath the shadowing trees  When those first happier ages were no more  But curst ambition still increas'd with power  When crouded towns fill'd the deserted plain  And craving passions a new life began  The peaceful woods were not so soon forgot  Th' uneasy soul her wonted pleasure sought  Reason when free and undisturb'd approves  The pleasing pensiveness of thoughtful groves  Hence twisted bowers and cooling grots were made  To imitate at least the rural shade  But men by furies urg'd and curst by fate  All that is calm and inoffensive hate  Guilt must prevail and bloodshed never cease  Nations are said to be undone by peace  Too well you know who oft unseen repair  To whispering courts enwrapp'd in finest air  In closets sit and unsuspected hear  What the great vulgar feign the little fear  By night while swains dream of successful loves  The ForestGenii wanton in their groves  And o'er the platted heath the FairyDemon roves  But when grey dawn awakes from pleasing rest  The yawning peasant and disturbs the beast  Thro' streets and noisy crowds they range unknown  And mark the conduct of the factious town  Britannia's sons like those of monstrous birth  When serpents teeth were sown in furrow'd earth  Enflam'd with rage and prone to mutual hate  With baneful strife distract th' endanger'd state  War is now thought the panaceal good  Quacks know no other cure but letting blood  Even when th' expiring wretch already faints  And not a lancet but a cordial wants  Those who could wish all temples shut beside  Ne'er think the gates of Janus set too wide  For endless slaughter as a blessing pray  Farewell the humble muse and shepherd's peaceful lay"  She said and all the nymphs with sorrow heard  When clad in white an heavenly form appear'd  A leavy crown adorn'd her radiant head  Majestic were her looks and thus she said  " Unbodied powers are not confin'd to floods  To purling rivulets or to shady woods  Kind demons on ungrateful man attend  Observe his steps and watch the hated fiend  The same good Genii guard the harmless sheep  When wearied Damon lies in thoughtless sleep  The same whose influence aids th' unsettled state  And gladly hastens on the work of fate  Rome's second king enjoy'd a fairy dame  To lonely woods the royal pupil came  To Numa's lessons and the ElfinBride  Rome all her grandeur ow'd and future pride  Bless'd powers and beings of the highest rank  Nor love the flowing stream nor flowery bank  Clad in etherial light the purer mind  Scorns the base earth and was for heaven design'd  Inferior orders have a meaner home  And here in wilds and woody mazes roam  To learned Magi we strange spells impart  Mysteries disclose and tell the secret art  With sacred misletoe the Druids crown'd  Sung with the nymphs and danc'd the pleasing round  But vulgar thoughts confound celestial forms  With envious fiends who raise destructive storms  And harmless elves that scuttle o'er the plain  Are rank'd with furies doom'd to endless pain  Mortals to earth and mean delights inclin'd  No pleasure in abstracted notions find  Unus'd to higher truths will not believe  Aught can exist but what their eyes perceive  Tho' to good demons they their safety owe  Few are those happy who their guardians know  But hear ye nymphs indulge no causeless fears  I know the lasting joys of coming years  I Britain's kind Egeria will protect  The loyal patriot and his schemes direct  All do not hate the plain nor fly the woods  Fields have their lovers and the groves their gods  If Bolingbroke and Oxford with a smile  Reward the song nor scorn the meaner style  Each bleeding tree shall tell the shepherd's flame  And in its wounds preserve the growing name  Swains to transmitted pipes shall long succeed  And sort with artful hand th' unequal reed  The birds on every bough will listening throng  And noisy strive to drown the envied song  Echo to distant rocks shall waft the tale  And reach with borrow'd sounds the lowest vale  While the glad lambs pursue the circling round  Frisk wanton and o'er grassy ridges bound  Would  Prior  he again the better choice approve  Who once of Henry sung and Emma's love  Would he a grateful guest to woods repair  And private ease prefer to public care  The nymphs would learn his song their own forget  And little fawns the moving tale repeat  Peace from neglected pipes will wipe the dust  When useless arms are doom'd to cankering rust  No dreaded sounds shall scare the finny race  Or fright the Triton from his lov'd embrace  The busy Naiads cleanse polluted floods  And nymphs frequent the longdeserted woods  The rivergods hug the declining urn  All to their streams or to their shades return  When civil wars disturb'd the Roman state  And Brutus hasten'd on his juster fate  While falsenam'd liberty and doubtful claim  Madded the world and fann'd Alecto's flame  The swain was injur'd and his song forgot  And Tityrus only by his flocks was sought  But when Octavius had the nations freed  And every realm its rightful lord obey'd  The God look'd down on the neglected groves  And deign'd to hear of peace and softer loves  Fields and their owners were with leisure bless'd  And Mantua's shepherd had his wrongs redress'd  So first the mountain tops are touch'd with light  And from the gloomy vales the swain invite  While mists below and intervening clouds  Cast a deep dusk on all the frowning woods  The shaded meadows view with envy round  The distant splendor of the rising ground  But soon the spreading rays expanded move  And streaming like a deluge from above  Sweep o'er the gladsome field and dart thro' every grove  By foreign wars intestine factions thrive  The dam destroy'd the imps not long survive  Tumultuous hurry an advantage gives  Both to the little and the greater thieves  A guilty act is in confusion hid  When busy times a nicer search forbid  So crafty fish of clearer streams afraid  Lie hid in eddies which themselves have made  Touch'd with the rose the jetty beetle dies  And from the spicy hills the vultur flies  So baser souls abhor the sweets of peace  Whose private gains by public loss increase  When noisy storms deluge the dropping leaves  The pensive lark retires and silent grieves  But chattering birds joy at th' expected flood  And with mixt clamours watch the teeming cloud  For then a grateful prey the horned snail  And worms o'er moisten'd clouds their folding bodies trail  Designing men the public welfare hate  Who cannot rise but on a ruin'd state  Base souls will always keep their native stain  And rooted passions will th' ascendant gain  The worm when once become a spotted fly  And borne on gaudy wings it mounts on high  Unchang'd admires the ordure whence it sprung  And feeds with pleasure on its native dung  But steady patriots will just schemes pursue  Nor fear the rage of the discarded few  Who prone to causeless change unwearied strive  Old crimes repeat and baffled plots revive  Eternal infamy rewards their pains  And tho' the flame is out the stench remains  What speciouscolour'd fraud or secret snare  Can St John's prudence 'scape or Oxford's care  Diseases oft prove fatal when conceal'd  But ripen'd sores if lanc'd are soonest heal'd  Slow Lentulus and rash Cethegus join  And with ambitious Catiline combine  Wretches who only in destruction skill'd  Try to pull down what they could never build  But when intent to spring the sudden mine  One Cicero can blast the base design  So when black storms cast up the boiling deep  And envious winds disturb the Triton's sleep  The shepherd who the watry conflict hears  Shuddering at distance for his pasture fears  Thinks with himself when will the tumult cease  Or what kind power can warring floods appease  But th' oceangods rous'd from their oozy beds  The trident grasp and nod their reedy heads  The waves rebuk'd fear to approach the shore  And all is hush'd and winds are heard no more  Peace guides her steps as St John leads the way  And all her little Loves around him play  When he arriv'd France the first time confess'd  Her court eclips'd by a politer guest  Unwilling own'd Britannia has her charms  And is as strong in eloquence as arms  When St John speaks who would refuse to hear  Mars smooths his brow and Pallas drops her spear  A thousand graces on his lips are hung  And Suada sips her nectar from his tongue  When wild suspicions cause distracting hate  And partyclamours sway the warm debate  Such eloquence the tumult overrules  Like falling drops it softens and it cools  It calms th'enrag'd and draws the stubborn minds  And to th' unwilling breast a passage finds  Nervous yet smooth the heart it gently steals  Like wine it sparkles but like oil it heals  He with his country shares one common fate  All St John love but who Britannia hate  Kennet of late neglects his broken urn  And St John's absence all the Dryads mourn  Not Gallus once in woods was so belov'd  Whose luckless flame the nymphs to pity mov'd  Heaven has its chosen favourites and on those  With partial hand its doubled gift bestows  While common souls like coarser stuffs laid by  Are not prepar'd to take the brighter dye  The kingly oaks engross the honey'd dews  Whose viscous sweets the meaner shrubs refuse  And every neighbouring tree neglected grieves  But willing spreads in vain its tasteless leaves  St John the woods and breezy forest loves  Where Nature's pride presuming art reproves  New beauties show themselves to nearer views  And themes untouch'd expect the skilful muse  The vegetable worlds neglected lie  And flowers ungather'd fall and nameless die  Thousands escape hid in the pressing throng  Unknown to Macer's or to Cowley's song  You Psecas know in seedy labour skill'd  What various herbage fatten'd pastures yield  And what unnumber'd kinds adorn the field  Whose fading beauties pass without regard  While every drooping herb upbraids the bard  What learned song will Nature's care impart  By what kind instinct and unstudied art  The numerous natives of the sheltering wood  Avoid their dangers or procure their food  What verse has told how smaller rivals wage  Unequal war and with the toad engage  They Arguslike are set around with eyes  And hung on silken threads the foe surprize  Spit on the poisonous wretch more deadly bane  Who deeplywounded feels the raging pain  Swift up her pendent womb Arachne climbs  While he scarce trails along his tortur'd limbs  But careful will the healing plantain find  Plantain to undeserving creatures kind  Whose sovereign herb the venom'd juice expels  And now the bloated wretch with innate poison swells  Or how the speckled snakes their prey surprize  And with hot fennel rub their weaker eyes  They when the bloom of warmer spring begins  Cast off as wornout cloaths their sloughy skins  With early youth returning vigour blest  Brandish the tongue and raise the azure crest  Ants prudent bite the ends of hoarded wheat  Lest growing seeds their future hopes defeat  And when they conscious scent the gathering rains  Draw down their windy eggs and pilfer'd grains  With summer's toil and ready viands fill  The deepest caverns of their puny hill  There lie secure and hug their treasur'd goods  And safe in labour'd cells they mock the coming floods  A thousand kinds unknown in forests breed  And bite the leaves and notch the growing weed  Have each their several laws and settled states  And constant sympathies and constant hates  Their changing forms no artful verse describes  Or how fierce war destroys the wandering tribes  How prudent Nature feeds her various young  Has been if not untold at least unsung  To th' insectrace the Muse her aid denies  While prouder men the little ant despise  But tho' the bulky kinds are easy known  Yet Nature's skill is most in little shown  Beside that man by some kind demon taught  Has secrets found that were of old unsought  Labourious wights have wonderous optics made  Whose borrow'd sight the curious searcher aid  And show what heaven to common view denies  Strange puny shapes unknown to vulgar eyes  So shadowy forms and sportive demons fly  Wafted on winds and not perceiv'd when nigh  Unseen they sweep along the grassy plains  And scud unseen before the whistling swains  But to those seers in northern isles confin'd  Inur'd to cold and harden'd by the wind  Th' indulgent powers have given a second fight  That kens the airy sylph and wandering sprite  No flitting elf the subtle eye escapes  When wanton genii sport in antic shapes  Men Nature in her secret work behold  Untwist her fibres and her coats unfold  With pleasure trace the threads of stringy roots  The various textures of the ripening fruits  And animals that careless live at ease  To whom the leaves are worlds the drops are seas  If to the finish'd whole so little goes  How small the parts that must the whole compose  Matter is infinite and still descends  Man cannot know where lessening Nature ends  The azure dye which plums in autumn boast  That handled fades and at a touch is lost  Of fairest show is all a living heap  And round their little world the monsters creep  Who would on colour dote or pleasing forms  If beauty when discover'd is but worms  When the warm spring puts forth the opening bud  The waken'd insects find their ready food  But when the summerdays dilate the gem  Stretch out the leaves and fix the growing stem  They die unknown and numerous kinds succeed  That bask in flowers or eat the ranker weed  Wanton in sultry heat and keep their place  'Till autumnfruits produce a different race  But tho' a thousand themes invite the Muse  Yet greater subjects will from mean excuse  They claim the grateful song whose prudent care  Has quench'd the wasting flames of endless war  Late civil rage alarm'd the trembling woods  And bursting sulphur scar'd the sylvangods  War fell'd the trees and spreading havock made  The nymphs could hardly find a sheltering shade  Now with less frightful sounds the fields are blest  The swains have leisure and the land has rest  Faction that Hydra is no longer fear'd  Her heads are lopp'd and all the wounds are sear'd  When innovating schemes successless prove  They do but fasten what they would remove  So restless winds would fly without restraint  Sweep down the corn and bend the growing plant  But taller trees withstand their giddy haste  And break the fury of the coming blast  They angry tear the leaves and blight the fruit  But strengthen while they shake and fix the spreading root  Be still ye aspinboughs nor restless scare  With busy trembling leaves the listening hare  And cease ye insects who to plants unkind  Or gnaw the root or bite the softer rind  Silent attend while I Britannia bless  And sing the future joys of lasting peace  Victoria long her fruitless labour mourn'd  Without effect her annual work return'd  One blow to Caesar gave the destin'd throne  Philippi made the Roman power his own  Swift as a ray shot from the rising sun  Pella's immortal youth his Persia won  But conquest now is stopp'd by every fort  Bloodshed is cheap and war becomes a sport  In vain the captains fall the heroes bleed  Fresh victims to the sacrifice succeed  So doubtful hills the wearied pilgrim sees  And flattering prospects give a fancied ease  Delusive hopes compel his fainting feet  To climb th' ascent and pass the steepy height  That summit gain'd far distant mountains rise  Whose towering ridges meet the sorrowing eyes  And pain renew'd the wish'dfor rest denies  Ten years could Hector coming fate retard  And from th' insulting Greek his Ilium guard  Yet waving heaps as antient ballads tell  The doubtful ruins of old Troy conceal  Now ten campaigns and battles yearly won  Transfer no kingdom and no king dethrone  But pitying Anna ends the fruitless toil  Blood shall no more enrich Flanderian soil  From her the injur'd States expect redress  She who maintain'd the war must make the peace  She gives the power whatever side prevails  Wheree'er the balance is she holds the scales  To her they all commit their common cause  She sets their limits and confirms their laws  Portions divides and gives to each his share  The right of birth or the reward of war  All must the just impartial hand acquit  And those who causeless murmurwill submit  So when th' Almighty with an awful nod  Made the rude Chaos own a greater God  The blended elements that long had strove  Would not so ready join in mutual love  But first the purer parts their places took  And subtle fire the meaner mass forsook  The war continued with the baser kind  While seas were loth to be by shores confin'd  Or earth to have the lowest place assign'd  Anna has long enrich'd the powers allied  Their want of treasure and of troops supplied  Yet they as wrong'd with awkward state complain  Insatiate thirst and would new empires gain  So wanton children sport in careless play  And slumbering lie or toy the hours away  Heedless they live nor sweat for daily bread  Yet cry and murmur if they are not fed  The Belgic states forget their former moan  But swoln with bloated pride and mighty grown  New conquests seek and deem the world their own  Nor ravish'd seas nor India's spicy plants  Content their wishes or suffice their wants  So when fierce rains wash down the lessen'd hills  And redden'd floods increase the swelling rills  The swift united streams haste to the plain  And swampy meads the gathering waters drain  Each neighbouring hill and every rising mound  Barrens itself t' enrich the lower ground  No moisture can suffice th' insatiate weeds  Cresses and filmy rush and flaggy reeds  Sunk in their slime the marshy vales below  Scorn those to whom their herbs such rankness owe  Their subject state they confident deny  And lowest fens will call themselves the High  Cease ye unthinking hills and strive no more  To swell th' ungrateful bogs with a too lavish store  The foreign realms whom Anna's arms sustain'd  Now boast of power as they before complain'd  So he who basely tempts the virtuous dame  In softer words conceals the guilty flame  The trembling suppliant her resentment fears  And adds to moving words more moving tears  But if the fair refuse with juster pride  And prudent scorn what ought to be denied  The ravisher confess'd resumes the sword  And rudely threatens whom he once ador'd  But none will long the offer'd peace refuse  Lest what was conquer'd they as certain lose  In vain the hireling troops their courage boast  Victoria sees not there her favourite host  The German chief retir'd nor could pursue  The welllaid schemes his warlike fancy drew  Men cannot guess th' events of future time  Ambition is the growth of every clime  None can the rise or fall of empires know  Where power now ebbs it may as sudden flow  Gallia has oft and oft has haughty Spain  Indulg'd their hopes of universal reign  And in revolving years may oft again  The Gods awhile seem to deserve no less  And smiling flatter princes with success  By wondrous turns the heavenly powers are known  And baffled schemes superior guidance own  Heaven has set bounds to every rising state  And kingdoms have their barriers fix'd by fate  An infant will the Gallic prince succeed  The sword is sheath'd no more the nations bleed  That kingdom hardly can itself defend  Where children reign and factious lords contend  Once Gallia's shore to Albion's cliffs was join'd  'Till seas grew rough and Nereus was unkind  Tho' lengthen'd wars may some distrust create  And sow the spreading seeds of vulgar hate  Again they may a stricter union prove  And join in mutual aid and mutual love  Nor shall the British line ensurance need  Or Belgic powers determine who succeed  For monarchy is heaven's peculiar care  But foreign aid is worse than civil war  The promis'd succour is an handle made  And a pretended reason to invade  When crafty Hengist with his Saxons came  To aid the isle and fix the doubtful claim  The easy Britains the false friend believ'd  And with fond joy the hostile troops receiv'd  But Druids taught by Nymphs repining sate  And saw the coming ills and knew Britannia's fate  And now the British fleets in southern seas  With spreading sails the wondering Nereids please  In havens erst unknown they proudly ride  While the glad Tritons force the lazy tide  Toss'd with fresh gales the wanton streamers flow  Nor dread the storms above nor rocks below  The powers protect who rule the restless sea  And winds themselves their steerage will obey  The Nymphs shall hide no more from human sight  But with their loveliest forms the bard invite  Swift Fawns in open view shall scour the plains  And be as once familiar with the swains  The harmless elves in every meadow seen  Will dance at midday on the public green  Pan and the shepherdyouth shall loving sit  Beneath one tree and sport in rustic wit  In the same shade alternate songs repeat  While Aegle helps the maid to press the streaming tear  But now the huntsman takes his usual round  While listening foxes hear th' unwelcome sound  And early peasants who prevent the day  May hither chance unweening guide their way  For seethe grayish edge of dawn appears  Night her departure mourns in dewy tears  The goblins vanish and the Elfin queen  Foregoes the pleasures of the trampled green  Nature's unwilling to be rouz'd so soon  And earth looks pale on the declining moon  The nimble hours dress out th' impatient sun  While rising fogs and whispering gales forerun  The bats a doubtful kind begin their sleep  And to their cells the darken'd glowworms creep  The coming day the conscious insects grieve  And with slow haste the grateful herbage leave  Wreathe o'er the grass and the moist path pursue  Streaking with viscous slime the shining dew  In some close shade a friendly covert find  And parent earth receives the reptile kind  Guilt and the day disturb the wily snakes  And urchins hide their theft in thorny brakes  All fly the sun and seek a cool retreat  Nor envy swarms who joy in scorching heat"  She said and sudden all the Elfin Fair  Vanish'd unseen and mixt with trackless air  But thou O Wyndham who didst ne'er disdain  The shepherd's gift nor scorn the rural strain  Tho' to no pompous sound the ear inclines  While the mean sense is propt by stronger lines  Accept the sylvan song  With pleasing look the fearful bard receive  You bad him first the humble cottage leave  Ready to praise and willing to excuse  You gave assurance to the bashful Muse  How would I now describe a generous mind  Improv'd by study and by courts refin'd  But you ah too resolv'd will not allow  The verse to tell what men already know  Envy itself their conduct must approve  Whom the prince honours and the people love  Tho' you in this unkind deny the bard  The only subject can his pains reward  You cannot make the tuneful Dryads cease  For Goddesses will sing of whom they please  Long will the grateful woods your name repeat  And Wyndham be the theme when next the Dryads meet    THE OAK AND DUNGHILL  A FABLE  Et vincere inglorium et atteri sordidum arbitrabatur  TACITUS  ON a fair mead a dunghill lay  That rotting smoak'd and stunk away  To an excessive bigness grown  By nightmen's labours on him thrown  Ten thousand nettles from him sprung  Who ever came but near was stung  Nor ever fail'd he to produce  The baneful hemlock's deadly juice  Such as of old at Athens grew  When patriots thought it Phocion's due  And for the man its poison prest  Whose merit shone above the rest  Not far from hence strongrooted stood  A sturdy oak itself a wood  With friendly height o'ertopt the grove  And look'd the favourite tree of Jove  Beneath his hospitable shade  The shepherds all at leisure play'd  They fear'd no storms of hail or rain  His boughs protected all the plain  Gave verdure to the grass around  And beautified the neighbouring ground  The gracious landlord joy'd to see  The prosperous vigour of his tree  And often sought when in distress  This oak's oracular redress  Sprung from the fam'd Dodonian grove  Which told to men the will of Jove  His boughs he oft with chaplets crown'd  With azure ribbons wreath'd them round  And there in golden letters wrought  " Ill to the man who evil thought"  With envious rage the dunghill view'd  Merit with honour thus pursued  Th' injustice of the times he moan'd  With inward jealousy he groan'd  A voice at length pierc'd thro' the smoke  And thus the patriot dunghill spoke  " If a proud look forerun a fall  And insolence for vengeance call  Dost thou not fear insulting oak  The just th' impending hatchet's stroke  When all the farmers of the town  Shall come with joy to pull thee down  And wear thy leaves all blithe and gay  Some happy Restoration Day  For 'tis reserv'd to those good times  To punish all thy matchless crimes  Beyond the Alps my mind now sees  The man shall fell such traytor trees  To heaven 'tis true thy branches grow  But thy roots stretch to hell below  Oh that my utterance could keep pace  In cursing thee and all thy race  Thou plunderer grown rich by crimes  Thou Wolsey of these modern times  Thou curst Sejanus of the plain  Thou slave of a Tiberian reign  Empson and DudleyStar and garter  A Kneza Menzicoffa Tartar"  Th' astonish'd farmers all around  Stood gaping at th' impetuous sound  The dunghill in high triumph lay  And swore the oak had nought to say  His work was donethe farmers all  Might gather round and see him fall  No  so th' eventthe oak was seen  To flourish more in fresher green  By scandal unprovok'd he stood  And answer'd thus the heap of mud  " When Folly Noise and Slander rage  And Calumny reforms the age  They in the wise no passions raise  Their clamours turn to real praise  Yet sure hardfated is the tree  Reduc'd to spatter dirt with thee  Soon should a branch from off my side  Chastise thine insolence and pride  Did not the wise obtain their ends  As well from enemies as friends  Thus some increase thy heap receives  Even from the falling of my leaves  Which like false friends when dropt from me  Assimilate and turn to thee  But be they thineNew seasons spread  New honours o'er my rising head"    THE THEORY OF TEARS  A FRAGMENT  BY WILLIAM STEVENSON ESQ  Sunt lachrymae rerum  TEars which the barrang'd orators command  Are tears of pleasure for the fee in hand  The greater this the more abundant those  Rated by price as wine by measure flows  But wines a due hilarity impart  Their tears add gladness to the heavy heart  Grief when sincere by no vain proof appears  Too vast for the parade of formal tears  So in the skies when deepcharg'd thunders brew  No clouds descend in rain or melt in dew  On Tully's words when listening senates hung  Charm'd by the living magic of his tongue  Few tears suffic'd for tears then learn'd to flow  Less at the call of lucre than of woe  Once from the offer'd hand your fee withdraw  That key which opes the cabinet of law  Tears then no more shall their full sluices break  Nor eyes amid the dew of rhetoricspeak  Thus when the sky a gloom of vapours shrouds  Thunders would mutter words thro' watery clouds  Alike so far each here the verse confines  That both are empty marks and passive signs  These from the touch of flames etherial roll'd  Those from the no less subtile touch of gold  This maxim then how much the truth beyond  " Hearts must with eyes for ever correspond"  Reverse the adage and behold it true  If you mankind thro' no false optics view  The doctor's tears if doctors weep at all  That soon his patient will recover fall  Each salient vein that vibrates still to health  Beats in repugnance to the pulse of wealth  Each sign that to a happy crisis tends  A tear resistless to its orbit sends  But here the pointed satire fain would stop  Joy too like sorrow boasts her pearly drop  From fleecy clouds on which the sunbeam plays  Oft falls the dewshower interspers'd with rays  Let Candor then who scorns the partial plan  Sometimes mistake the doctor for a man  " All hope is gone see how the doctor cries  " His tears ah speak in silence from his eyes  " Good tender manBut say dear doctor say  " Is it too certain what your looks betray  " Has Physic now no last resource to try  " And must the sweet the lovely patientdie  " But sure the dire disease in luckless hour  " O'er youth and strength can scarcely boast the power  " Not yet attain'd the fever's wonted height  " To make our noonday hopes all set in night"  " No heaven be prais'd" with fervorlifted eyes  " My tears are tears of joy" the doctor cries  " No more the fever's heats internal burn  " No more deliriums big with fate return  " Mix those few cordials and your fears abate  " Our patient's in a convalescent state"  Short triumph his lank purse so empty felt  Each eye would fain from other motives melt  Now certain hopes health's kind prognostics give  So soon cur'd patients how shall doctors live  Men must debauch take fevers faint and rave  Few hopes attend them and late periods save  Their fatal snares must wine and women spread  Or doctors go a begging for their bread  But useless is the hint if meant as such  Mankind are sure too complaisant by much  To suffer those who kindly them preserve  From fell disease and death itself to starve  Now to the pulpit turns the muse's eye  There haply tears from proper fonts to spy  For sure if such us any where o'ertake  Altho' withheld for friendship's pressing sake  Tho' rarely found in rostrums it must be  Where God descends and mortals bend the knee  Where tears sincere in heaven's pure eye disclose  A finer twinkle than the diamond shows  Where all confess a tale that still begins  How much Religion suffers by their sins  Religion that sublime and gracious plan  By which for angel we exchange the man  But holdall honour to the sacred gown  Tho' less rever'd the gemencircled crown  A scoff contemptuous here or laugh of scorn  Were Virtue to decry celestialborn  Were to defame the volume of the skies  Which penn'd by hand divine expanded lies  Far more for devils act less monstrous parts  Were to eraze God's image from our hearts  Degrade the gown religion and the text  You must dread thought dethrone Jehovah next  The person from the office we divide  To shun the stigma or of guilt or pride  Pride that betrays a littleness of mind  And guilt indeed of an enormous kind  Tears gushing forth the parson's sight bedim  His eyes like stars in mists uncertain swim  Nor wonder tears his cautious lids beguile  For oh the melting pathos of his stile  Who can behold him and refrain from tears  None but the marblehearted wretch whohears  His head his heart his eyes all correspond  Like mutual friends of one another fond  But had he been from selfcomplacence freed  His head his heart his eyes had disagreed  Not joy but grief in tears had then indulg'd  Express'd her feelings and her doubts divulg'd  This vain parade of partial tears is shown  Because the preacher's to himself unknown  In big effusive consciousness they run  For what his pen not wicked heart has done  His pen's the sinner nor less oddly true  His pen's the generous expiator too  Yet stranger still dry eyes had shown his sense  Had he surpriz'd his pen in one offence  What could he all awake to feeling more  Had he himself been faulty o'er and o'er  For acting ill who can in all excel  Sure heaven will pardon him for writing well  His sins indeed are multiplied he owns  As are his flock's which hourly he bemoans  But say ye adepts how things fit to call  Has not his quill allpotent cancell'd all  But this not nature's but the preacher's law  No tears can once but sacerdotal draw  Hence tho' the rapt selfconscious parson weeps  No social tear a wellbred cadence keeps  Or if a courteous drop with his consents  The cheek alone but not the heart relents  They weep because they see but listen not  Or if they heard the substance all forgot  Thus womens eyes abundant use to flow  Ask them the reason whythey do not know  But shall coarse satire quite engross the page  And thro' the numbers spend its gloomy rage  No let some gentle subject close the song  To the soft passions softer strains belong  The muse increasing ardors too may feel  And kindle onward like a chariotwheel  But not as chariots raise the dust around  Truth to obscure or reason to confound  Tears are the eye's pellucid dews that fall  At Pity's summons or at Mercy's call  Tho' ruthless eyes ofttimes affect them too  As stones themselves distil a breathing dew  As springs to earth allgently they impart  A kindly genial softness to the heart  Tears when the mind enjoys unruffled ease  For formsake shed or from desire to please  Are like those rains thro' sunshine oft sent down  From partial clouds when nature wears no frown  Tears are the special messengers akin  To oracles on errands from within  To tell mankind beyond conjectures vain  Those secrets friendship only can explain  What active passions rise in tender strife  What soft affections touch the springs of life  Tears are the silent language of the heart  That more far more than empty sounds impart  By which it loves o'erburden'd to complain  When words would but offend or prove in vain  Tears ease the soul in anguish and despair  Leaving a sadlypleasing languor there  Thus closepent clouds dissolve in hasty showers  By which the thunder loses all its powers  By which the sky far as the view unfolds  A temperature serene and soften'd holds  Tears are the gentle streams that off convey  Those floods that would o'erwhelm us by delay  The heart's big swell much by misfortunes griev'd  That heaving soon would burst if not reliev'd  Tears are the tender proofs of love sincere  In silence shed whence no reports take air  Shed as the tribute of congenial minds  While each a more than vulgar transport finds  False eyes indeed may weep if fame divulge  But true affection only can indulge  Tears are the debt in pearly drops convey'd  But more than pearls in price to merit paid  In which none act the base insolvent's part  But those whom Nature form'd without a heart  Tears wait on vice and oft on virtue too  As winterclouds dissolve in summerdew  Tears tho' the cheek a partial mark retain  Wash out if shed aright a fouler stain  Which as it fainter and more faint appears  Makes angels envy humankind their tears  Tears are the silent arguments to tell  That man's immortal tho' at first he fell  Immortalfor he weeps for joy ofttimes  Free from the sting of recollected crimes  And what can Nature's law thus counteract  What thus sensation's springs revers'd affect  O thought sublime strong proofs inculcate hence  How much inferior to the mind the sense  Dissolv'd in tears that feebly it reflects  Back to the soul what rapturous she expects  As Cynthia tho' in fullorb'd glory bright  But faintly represents her parent light  Thus men infer the soul superior must  Exist apart when dust returns to dust  For if the body impotent withstands  Those transports she to infinite demands  Reason dare promise her desires immense  As virtue's longexpected recompence  But when or where 'tis not for man to know  That full enjoyment sense can ne'er bestow  When matter lives in various forms no more  And all the farce of human life is o'er  ON THE ILLNESS OF DR TURNER PRESIDENT OF C C C OXFORD  BY DR BASIL KENNET  HOW venerable Turner's silver hairs

heat  Entrench'd within the bosom of the vale  You catch the morning sun or evening gale  Then trip the verdant lawn and pensive muse  Or moralize within the gloom of yews  'Till something starts to

POEM ON A PIN  BY MR WOTY  FOR once ye critics let the sportive Muse  Her fool'scap wear spite of the shaking head  Of sterneyed Gravityfor tho' the Muse  To frolic be dispos'd no song she chants  Immoral nor one picture will she hold  But Virtue may approve it with a smile  Ye sylvan deities awhile adieu  Ye curling streams whose banks are fring'd with flowers  Violet and harebell or the kingcup bright  Farewell for I must leave your rich perfumes  To sing the Pin in eversounding lays  But not that Pin at whose circumference  Rotund the strongnerv'd rustic hurls the bowl  Ponderous and vast nor that which window bars  From thief nocturnal nor that other call'd  A skittle chiefly found where alehouse snug  Invites mechanic to the flowing cup  Of Calvert's mild o'ercanopied with

consequential For by thee  Beauty sets off her charms as at the glass  Lucy or Phillis best adapts thy point  Without thy service would the ribband flaunt  Loose to the fanning gale nor on the head  Of belle would stand her whimsical attire  The kerchief from her neck of snow would fall  With freedom bold and leave her bosom bare  How would the sempstress trim thy want regret  As she her apron

Singing to thee I shall the sweeter sing  For thou delightest too in jocund themes  Tho' every Muse has visited thy dreams  But chief thou bathest in that silver wave  Where blithe Anacreon's Muse was wont to lave  Where allfacetious Flaccus wont to sport  Where Humour reigns and Comus keeps his court  But what shall I a poor pretender win  Since all my sonnets are not worth thy  The Pin a poem written by mr Woty See p  Pin  The poleenamour'd Needle pass we here  By which the mariners are taught to steer  Nor mean we now that deathdenouncing  The Needles  streight  Where oft the merchant trembles for his freight  The Spanish Needle a new theme we sing  And to our friend the shining tribute bring  Need we the process of its birth admire  Or trace it from the temper'd bars to wire  How first the Rounder gives the graceful form  Beneath the hammer while he keeps it warm  Or how the Polisher with smoothing file  Bids the rich toy in silver lustre smile  Need we to sing the Pointer's curious art  Which makes it keen as Cupid's fatal dart  How next the Piercer's punching tools supply  The little Cyclops with a single eye  'Midst of the forehead where it takes in light  And forms a pleasing visto to the sight  Thro' this small skylight may we use that name  With spectacles oft pores the antient dame  And when the casement plain appears to view  Labouring to introduce the flaxen clue  Raptur'd she smiles if she the pass attain  And reaps the pleasure which she bought with pain  So have I seen a Philomath explore  The windings of a problem o'er and o'er  Turn it and twist it round a thousand ways  Lost and bewilder'd in the endless maze  'Till instantaneous on a sudden thought  Happy at last the great solution's caught  With extacy too high to be exprest  The Eureka inspires his glowing breast  Fill'd with the raptures of approaching fame  To the New Almanack he sends his name  Enjoys the bright discovery in his mind  And ranks himself the foremost of mankind  But leave we terms mechanic since the muse  Now soars ambitious to sublimer views  To lead the Needle to its worthiest plan  Its ultimate designthe use of man  Its use imply we from its early want  Ere Wisdom's voice could charm or Art inchant  Ere petticoats were made or breeches worn  To sew his figleaves Adam us'd a thorn  Sharp poignant emblem of each future bride  To prove a thorn in every husband's side  'Twas in the days of yore when Time was young  If we may credit bards and antient song  Ere Solomon was seated on his throne  Or ere the birth of Needlework was known  That young Needilla fair and chaste as snow  Liv'd with her grandsire on the  Needles were first made there and discovered from the Needlefish  banks of Po  Beyond the river's mouth where Ocean roars  Whose briny wave salutes the sedgy shores  Guiltless of love unconscious of his fire  She gather'd shellfish for her helpless sire  His sole support and pillar of his age  For him she frequent risk'd the billow's rage  Spurr'd by parental dutylo the tide  Once furious hemm'd her in on every side  This Algaret a fisherman in view  Anxious beheld and row'd his swift canoe  Timely he snatch'd her from the dashing wave  And clasp'd the prize which he was doom'd to save  The lovely damsel from the deep he bore  And after wedded on the friendly shore  Three moons had scarce elaps'd to close their wane  It chanc'd she spied her husband on the main  'Twas on an evening mild the sky serene  Heaven shed its softest splendors on the scene  Hush'd every breeze and every wave asleep  Needilla risk'd her beauty on the deep  With Algaret to seek the scaly prey  Perfidious winds and more perfidious sea  The sail was torn their little vessel tost  On barren rocks fardistant from the coast  When in a moment every wave subsides  And leaves the prospect of the silver tides  Long was the space to gain the distant shore  Their cordage broke and shatter'd every oar  What can they helplesslo Needilla spies  A pointed shellfish pierc'd with argent eyes  A heap of seaweed on the rocks was cast  Which thro' the eyes with eager haste she past  With these her ready fingers tack'd the sail  Which Algaret unfurl'd to catch the gale  Safe they arriv'dhence from Needilla's name  The Needlefish has fill'd the trump of fame  Hence the  The Venetians improv'd needles and after them the Tyrians and Sidonians  Venetians took the hint to form  Needles of steeldiscover'd from a storm  Such is the work of chance which oft prevents  Our deepest projects and our best intents  Thus since those days has gravity been found  By a bare apple's dropping on the ground  Art thus grop'd on bewilder'd in the dark  'Till from the flint of genius like a spark  Issued the Needle with a newborn light  And struck improvement's beam upon the sight  CANTO II  OLD Nature smil'd to see this child of art  From her own womb like some bright meteor start  Wellpleas'd she gave the seeds of flax to spread  And hence the Needle's soft companionThread  A corresponding amity began  And both were wedded by the care of man  When long they liv'd in amorous friendship join'd  The Thread grew rotten and the Needle blind  For who can rule th' uncertain chance of life  So fares it in the end with man and wife  Our froward dames are often out of joint  And husbands like the Needle lose their point  The Silkworm next her curious weft display'd  And wrought her lines along the mulberry shade  The Needle soon another mistress found  A softer bride more elegant and round  Of firmer texture and of glossier hue  Needles like men are fond of all that's new  For now the blade a libertine is grown  Like man his maker quickly tir'd of one  Yes bigamy still tempts the lawless crowd  But thank the laws ye wives'tis not allow'd  What a third wifeay tremble at the word  Ye former wivesthe Needle weds a third  He weds the daughter of old Farmer Fleece  Even such a dame as Jason brought from Greece  A bride full coarse and recreant to his love  But once unitedsupple as a glove  Hairy and rough of Esau's rustic breed  Who mock'd her rivals of the worm and weed  For her the Needle must his size enlarge  And the third wife still brings a heavy charge  Her name was Lady Worsted and she came  From Lady Woola matron of high fame  She boasted blood and blood of tincture deep  Descended from the lineage of asheep  And thus while dear polygamy prevail'd  The Needle still with wind and current sail'd  Yet like Sultanas tho' they wooed their Turk  Each wife was skill'd and constant to her work  For joint or separate they maintain'd their vows  And never left the drudgery to poor spouse  Each had her own departmentLady Silk  Deck'd the white glove for hands as white as milk  She claim'd the mantuamaking as her trade  Her's was the jantee trolloppee and shade  From the smirk lady tomy lady's maid  'Twas she set off the milliner so gay  From humble sattin to proud padesuay  She trimm'd the bonnet and the flaming hat  Proportion'd to the face or lean or fat  Fair Lady Thread profess'd the sempstress' art  In the fine shirt or shift she warm'd the heart  Sometimes she wanton'd in the linen gown  From Lady Bab to Dolly of the town  While Gammar Worsted wrought the humbler stuff  Of various colours for her work was rough  Like these did women lead industrious lives  What halcyondays were in the gift of wives  Vain rovers then would envy what they hate  And only fools reject the married state  But here my Muse the homespun theme must change  O'er the sad field of elegy to range  To sing the dire misfortune of the dame  Who died a victim to the Needle's fame  So home the puncture that she bled to death  And thro' some artery resign'd her breath  Th' industrious finger sudden felt the smart  And quick convey'd it to her throbbing heart  The crimson streams precipitately move  To guard their fortthe citadel of love  In vainfor Death too close a siege had laid  And took by storm the miserable maid  Here draw the veillet fancy paint the rest  And share that grief which cannot be exprest  CANTO III  TO man the sway of nations was assign'd  The Needle's empire fell to womankind  Bright as her form and taper as her waist  Like her refin'd and polish'd as her taste  With eye of light with poignant fancy crown'd  Keen as the Needle to impart the wound  Like the sharp weapon she with pointed wit  Can sting the heart of noble or of cit  With mazy clue and Daedalean skill  Can lead thro' winding labyrinths at will  Arachnelike within her nets can lie  Quick to surprize the proud entangled fly  Ye taylors glovers staymakers beware  Nor still usurp the province of the fair  Ye sadlers too ye maleembroiderers yield  The Needle to the womanas her field  'Tis her's to bear this spear of softer war  And her's to drive the Amazonian car  When did a woman labour in the forge  To form the bolt for Jupiteror George  Or when did Mars or Vulcan intervene  To walk the paths of Beauty's Sovereign Queen  Despise we not great Hercules who bore  The female distaff on the Lydian shore  And look we not with proud fastidious eyes  On Peleus' son who wore the female guise  With pain we read of Sampson when he gave  His giantstrength to be a woman's slave  These paid the forfeit for their want of pride  And the three heroes for a woman died  Emasculated man be wise in time  Or meet their fortunes as you shar'd their crime  Come Woty wilt thou deign to climb with me  Old Pindus' topor shall I follow thee  Thou take the lead and like Elisha I  Will catch thy mantle to the Muse's sky  Wilt thou with me the Needle's toil pursue  And laugh at Mother Griffith's poor Review  Come leave lawquirks and precedents awhile  For thy own native tonguethe Muse's style  Close by thy own Parnassus' shrubs we'll stray  And from dull business steal one happy day  But mark the Musefor she proceeds to sing  The Needle's labours on sublimer wing  The sacred veil sequester'd females chose  And left the world for solitude's repose  Here Eloisa mourn'd her Abelard  While Love inspir'd the nun to be a bard  'Twixt grace and nature struggling soft desire  Prompted her tongue and tun'd her silver lyre  Not Lesbian Sappho sung a sweeter strain  Nor half so sweet does Philomel complain  For Abelard had tutor'd her when young  In Wisdom's lore and in the Muse's song  So Ovid his Corinna did inspire  With love with learning and Apollo's lyre  To fill the vacant intervals of time  Fair Eloise beguil'd the hours with rhime  But rhime not always tho' its numbers charm  Can sooth a lovesick bread with passion warm  Her glowing fancy to the Needle flies  And first behold the works of Nature rise  Deepread in sage philosophy her hand  Bids a creation dawn at her command  Here the bright sun emerges from a cloud  There thickening mists his golden lustre shroud  At distance Cynthia shines amid her train  In fullorb'd glory thro' the heavenly plain  His glowing car there Sol in Ocean laves  And the horizon stoops to drink the waves  And now the Needle to our earth descends  Where the tall forest to the tempest bends  Here valleys sink and hoary mountains rise  The lark obsequious in light ether flies  In liquid lapse a river winds below  Here bleat the sheep and there the oxen low  Vision has ears can see the torrent roar  And ears can see the billows lash the shore  Who has not heard the forked lightning fly  Or seen the thunder crack along the sky  In picture fancy every organ sways  We hear the painted shepherd tune his lays  Such is the force of mimic art which draws  Amphionlike even quarries to her laws  Painting and Poetry twinsisters vie  Thro' fancy's ear to charm the ravish'd eye  Beneath the plastic hand of Eloise  The timorous aspin trembles at the breeze  Clear flows the brook beneath the shining toy  Which seems to work for Eloise with joy  Here skuds the trout thro' shades of finest lawn  There o'er the velvet parks the bounding fawn  Here blooms a gardenthere a fountain flows  Here the pale lilly weds the crimson rose  Now twisted woodbines form a proud alcove  Beneath whose arch she rais'd a shrine to Love  Amid the graceful forms which deck'd the shrine  Large as the life young Abelard was thine  And in the train of beauteous nymphs which shone  Resplendent Eloise had wrought her own  She first in tap'stry ere the curious loom  Taught trees to wave their tops and flowers to bloom  Gave the bold figures to the ravish'd sight  Where shepherds sport or warlike heroes fight  Hence emulous the fair sequester'd maid  Still guides the Needle thro' the rich brocade  Or when warm love is prevalent o'er grace  Breathes her fond passion on a piece of lace  For ere the intermingling bobbins toil'd  The brighter needle all their glories foil'd  No supplemental patterns then were known  For Love or Fancy was the guide alone  In rich embroidery Cupid tipt his dart  While sage Minerva dignified the art  CANTO IV  THUS from the essays of a lovesick heart  Mechlin and Brussels stole their mimic art  Hence lace with all its gay creation rose  Essential ornament of belles and beaux  Ally of beautysupplement of sense  And next to snuff the orator's defence  Grac'd with this armour if he wave his hand  Say what plain shirt his prowess can withstand  Not half so strong the brilliant's shining aid  When on the finger in full light display'd  So when the flag of Britain waves on high  And gives its streaming glories to the sky  All other flags submit and strike their pride  To the known empress of old ocean's tide  Nor pass we here the knittingneedle's aid  Once the delight of each industrious maid  In days of yore near Nottingham's fair town  Ere the wove stocking to the leg was known  Young Leius a Cantab of learned fame  Sigh'd for Kinnetta with a virtuous flame  With unavailing passion long he strove  To win the icy virgin to his love  In vain he sung in vain he touch'd the lyre  Or boasted sage Apollo as his sire  Apollo's self in vain to Daphne prov'd  The high deserts thro' which he fruitless lov'd  Like her Kinetta fled the amorous swain  And he like sage Apollo wooed in vain  Tho' oft the laws of motion he explain'd  And why velocity its end attain'd  How the quick needles form'd the oblong squares  Or what proportion time to motion bears  Why the diameter of calf and small  By due gradations cause the threads to fall  Or why the seam behind was like the Line  Parting each segment of the fair design  Oft on his knee imploring would he beg  To tell why Italy was call'd the leg  Or why some sages held a fond dispute  Affirming it was rather likea boot  Deaf to his learning on her work intent  She sought the safe retreat of winding Trent  Or oft to Sherwood's forest bent her way  And to her knitting sung the sprightly lay  Enrag'd his philosophic heart was turn'd  To proud disdain and whom he lov'd he scorn'd  Within a wooden frame by art divine  Assisted by Apollo and the Nine  In order rang'd a thousand needles shone  A shuttle thro' the woof was taught to run  With expedition thus divinely taught  With disappointed love and passion fraught  He first the stocking wove within a loom  Glorious discovery in his peaceful room  His peaceful room the future scene of war  Whose arts ten thousand female hands debar  From honest breadso Thracian women tore  Harmonious Orpheus in the days of yore  With hasty step full to Kinetta's eyes  Justfinish'd he display'd the newborn prize  " Now scornful maid he cries to wisdom's lore  " Dare to prefer thy Knitting Needles more  " Thine and thy sister females arts proud fair  " For love despis'd shall vanish into air  " From an unhappy but an injur'd maid  " I learn'd the secret to destroy thy trade  " I spied Arachne's web thro' optic glass  " And saw where lines o'er lines transversely pass  " Enrag'd like her she taught me first to know  " The happy item of thine overthrow"  Stung to the heart superior merit aw'd  Kinetta's mind and Leius seem'd a god  The work stupendous in the frame appear'd  Like magic or as if divinely rear'd  Now to Love's altar she submissive bow'd  Nor blush'd to own the newborn flame aloud  With soften'd look the blooming youth she eyed  Her brow unarm'd with supercilious pride  Conscious he felt the sympathetic heat  Glow in his breast and at his bosom beat  " I know thee by myself Oh nymph divine  " I feel thy heart's warm passion kindle mine"  Young Leius criedand clasp'd her to his arms  Then from the town he bore her vanquish'd charms  To Cambridge safe convey'd his happy prize  Ere the dread females should tumultuous rise  Too well he prophesied the dire event  Lo to his chamber with a fell intent  Forth rush'd in haste the Amazonian bands  Rage in their looks and broomsticks in their hands  First fell the victim of their ire the loom  And next the chamber met its fated doom  Him too they sought for author of their woe  Fatidic Phoebus sav'd him from the blow  He with a beam of his allseeing light  Had warn'd young Leius to a sudden flight  Else had they torn him piecemeal in their rage  As Thracian dames once serv'd the  Orpheus  vocal Sage  Maugre their fury Leius perseveres  His labours flourish'd with his growing years  Ten thousand looms the happy texture wove  One reach'd the starsa monument of love  A thousand shining needles light array'd  Near  See Poet Cal Vol p  Granby's hat effulgent are display'd  Hence mariners the wellknown term assume  Who cryhow large the distant vessels loom  Here 'mid the heavens the Loom shall ever shine  A constellation sacred to the Nine  And when we see a star glide cross the skies  Sage bards well know it is the shuttle flies  And when pale streamers gild the midnight air  These are the threadslike Ariadne's hair  CANTO V  REsume we now the theme historic Maid  Where we digressive broke the homespun thread  Tho' every Muse in episode delight  Subject and episode are shade and light  Ere the gay thimble claim'd its later birth  Ere gold and luxury had stain'd the earth  Long had the taper finger felt the smart  Sharp as the wound which thrills from Cupid's dart  Whose arrows dipt in honey and in gall  With softer puncture Chloe's heart enthrall  Various expedients were applied in vain  To guard the fairone from the stinging pain  Thick leaves subsidiary were often bound  On folded paper to prevent the wound  Until the blueeyed Maid's indulgent care  Full oft invok'd took pity on the fair  She from the regions of eternal day  To Paphos on a visit wing'd her way  The queen of beauty saw with wondering eye  Wisdom bright regent and her chariot nigh  When thus aside"What cause can Pallas move  " That Prude divine to grace the court of Love  " Why this high honour from th' imperial dame  " Whose cold virginity defies our flame"  She rung the bella thousand Cupids hear  A thousand Cupids at the porch appear  Vying they seem to wage a sportive war  Who first shall help the Goddess from her car  " What favour can Minerva ask from Love"  Said Venus to the headsprung child of Jove  " Since Wisdom solemnly disowns his sway  " And rarely deigns to trifle time away"  " Oh Goddess you mistake Minerva cried  " Apollo's self the pleasing smart has tried  " Fair Daphne's name in capitals he wears  " The posy of the ring which binds his hairs  " A sprig of laurel in his bosom too  " For Love the power of Wisdom can subdue  " But not for man Minerva sues your grace  " I beg a favour for the female race  " A boon which Cupid and his Loves may grant  " Your son ne'er frown'd upon a woman's want  " The maids of industry whom I protect  " And next to wisdom's sons esteem my sect  " Have long implor'd me to remove a pain  " From fingers wounded with a guiltless stain  " Not reputation's wound which few can bear  " Is half so painful to my darling fair  " An implement there is a female toy  " Sharp as the arrow of your oneeyed boy  " With this the sisters of my art have led  " Longtime with pleasing toil the ductile thread  " But pleasing toils are mingled still with pain  " Such is the chequer'd lot of human gain  " The useful toy fallacious to its trust  " Ost at the head has thro' the finger burst  " Whence trickling ichor issues from the wound  " Tho' guarded well with leaves or paper round  " This is the implementbehold the head  " From which the purest virgin blood is shed  " I had myself to Mulciber applied  " But toys like these are more to Love allied  " Vulcan on sight would take it for a dart  " And seen refer me to young Cupid's art  " Therefore to Love I supplicate alone  " And at his footstool beg the gracious boon  " That corresponding to the needle's head  " A guard be form'd which should the finger wed  " To shield th' industrious fair from future harm"  To whom Love's Queen with glowing friendship warm  " Be thine to think how Venus to oblige  " Who highly honours Wisdom's sovereign liege  " Be her's to speak and Venus shall attend  " To every mandate of her lovely friend"  Scarce had she spoke when emptyquiver'd came  The potent God of every softer flame  " Mama he criedI've emptied all my store  " And now am come to forge ten thousand more  " In Mecklenburg I've lodg'd a golden dart  " And left its fellow in Augusta's heart  " And laughing ran awaythe last I shot  " Not easily the sting will be forgot  " Hymen shall celebrate their nuptials soon  " Or else my bow and arrow's out of tune"  Here interrupted Love's imperial queen  For shy Minerva ran behind the skreen  " Who do you think you wanton claims your power  " No less than wisdom's Goddess and this hour  " This precious hour bright Wisdom claims your aid  " Appear Minerva from behind yon shade"  At sight of Wisdom Cupid scrap'd a bow  Half smile half frown contending on his brow  " My dear Minerva cried my dimpled boy  " For what you told Mama I give you joy  " And honour you for those wellchosen darts  " Infix'd so wisely in two royal hearts  " There may I safely with thy conquests join  " Their heads belong to metheir hearts be thine  " I'm come to beg a boonyou'll not deny  " 'Tis for your favourite women I apply"  She then produc'd the needle to his view  Alas the wellknown instrument he knew  " And what am I to do with this" says Love  " Is it a doughty thunderbolt of Jove  " With which when you first started from his brain  " You sagely thought man's vices to restrain"  He jesting spokeMinerva understood  And spite of wisdom anger flush'd her blood  " Nay be not angry bright sagacious dame"  Sly Cupid cried"my Psyche has the same  " Ten thousand of such toys my art has form'd  " Long sincewhen in my forge the steel I warm'd"  " No"smiling answer'd the allsapient queen  " I want a guard or shield to intervene  " To save the finger from the poignant smart  " No shield but mine I know can turn thy dart"  To whom young Cupidstifling here a laugh  " You overrate my wisdom now by half  " Myriads of shields adapted to the use  " Long since for women did my skill produce  " Thimbles you mean well known to every maid  " Long since my forges form'd the bright parade  " Wisdom not always knows what Love has done  " Tho' bright Minerva mocks at Beauty's son  " Secreted still be all her wiles from me  " And Love's arcanas be conceal'd from thee  " Just vengeance for Arachne's wretched doom  " For Love now guides the needle and the loom"  He laugh'da thousand Loves the banter join  Which half abash the Goddess tho' divine  Her car precipitate she mounts and flies  To seek her own dominion in the skies  Foil'd by the God to him she left the care  Of every toy which decorates the fair  And Love shall reign in spite of Wisdom's rules  And Love shall prove her wisest sagesfools  FIRE WATER AND REPUTATION  BY THE SAME  NICE to the touch as ermine chaste  Sweet reputation soon is lost  Before detraction's beam 'twill waste  And prove us bankrupts to our cost  How strictly then should prudence guard  This rich invaluable gem  Whence honour sprouts the bright reward  Fullblowing from so frail a stem  To prove my moral staunch and true  Three travellers once took the road  Each had a separate point in view  And each no doubt his own abode  One was the element of Fire  A right choice spirit of the age  The boon companion of desire  And well adapted to engage  Water a smooth deceitful spark  Walk'd with himand you'll say that's strange  But stranger met in Noah's ark  And any novelty for change  The third was Reputation sweet  As violet or damask rose  They talk'd of Britain's conquering fleet  And who were friends and who were foes  At length three roads appear'd in view  Alas the dearest friends must part  A future commerce to renew  They ask'd each other's trade or art  By what sure tokens each may find  Upon enquiry one another  If haply each were so inclin'd  On meeting to salute his brother  Warmest in converse Fire began  " My friends I part with

knownthe rainbow and the fountain"  " Alas sweet Reputation cries  With folded hands and candid air  " Unlike you both in shape or size  " I'm sought with pain and found with care  " Ah me if I but go

MDCCXXXVI  WHere free from sense intrench'd in earth no more  The soul unbodied gains its native shore  Where Truth's uncloying banquet ever new  Opens the depths of science to its view  No longer on the verge it darkly strays  But mystic Nature from within surveys  Nor wants the telescopic glass to trace  God's power and wisdom thro' the boundless space  Where doubts no more nor mysteries confine  Its powers enlarg'd its nature all divine  He's goneand there erects his deathless head  How vain our sorrows which lament him dead  Where Clarke Boyle Newtoneach exalted mind  Each while on earth

THE MINISTER OF STATE  A PANEGYRIC  OCCASIONED BY READING A LATE POEM ENTITLED THE MINISTER OF STATE A SATIRE  BY P PS  " UNgrateful Rome"the generous Scipio said  And in retirement's shade conceal'd his head  Ungrateful Britainmight the Patriot say  Or if he will not speak it others may  Say will thy generous heart the Muse permit  Merit and Thee to sing exalted Pitt  While fir'd with honest rage she sighs to see  Base Scandal dart her venom'd tongue at thee  She must she dares th' attempt however new  To give her warmest praise where praise is due  She burnsindeed unfashionably fir'd  She burns to praise the minister retir'd  Here needs not fiction gild the face of truth  Thy voice inspirited our generous youth  That bad at once their glittering falchions glow  And cast a dreadful gleam upon the foe  Ere this Britannia hung her drooping head  And inly mourn'd her antient spirit fled  Ere this how idly did her navies sweep  In useless pageantry the silent deep  And as they sail'd along th' insulting foe  Smil'd at the scene and mock'd the harmless show  But when on thee the sovereign fix'd his choice  With joy reviving Britons heard thy voice  Wing'd at thy word the conquering navy flies  And shouts of victory rend the echoing skies  Fresh schemes of honour every bosom fill  While Expectation holds Attention still  The trembling French dread every deeplaid plan  And while they curse the foe admire the man  Ere this see France vain insolent and proud  With hostile threats distress the timid crowd  Fear seiz'd each trembling breast th' alarm began  Thro' every heart the mean infection ran  To save that land they call'd a foreign friend  Which Britons were unable to defend  Days of disgrace which call the scalding tear  Down the pale cheek and wound the tingling ear  Oh be the deed forgotwith honest rage  May history from her annals rend the page  When thus no bosom seem'd with ardor fir'd  And Britain's courageonly not expir'd  Say shade of Wolfe on that ensanguin'd plain  Which ever shall thy memory retain  Where while thy bosom pour'd the purple tide  Fair Victory stood weeping by thy side  Glow'd not thy heart with Pitt's august design  'Twas his to form to execute was thine  That gave proud Gaul Britannia's strength to know  Which fell with mighty ruin on the foe  I see I see the sacred shade advance  Bright flash his lightning eyes quick gleams his quivering lance  How stern the Hero's awful form appears  While these indignant accents pierce my ears  " Youth how lamented on these plains I fell  " Let Britain's voice that wept in triumph tell  " Let the same voice which gratitude once fir'd  " Speak the strong joy which patriotworth inspir'd  " But oh the changeIf gratitude be dead  " In vain the Patriot plann'd the Hero bled  " No not in vainfor benefits will last  " However faction rage or malice blast  " Ungrateful land if thus his godlike mind  " The mean return of tainted slander find  " My generous ardor may have found the same  " And courage may be sunk in folly's name  " I bless when such ingratitude I see  " The death that snatch'd me from a land like thee"  He said and vanish'd into empty air  The sounds yet murmuring on th' attentive ear  Oh muchlamented Shade tho' just thy rage  While scandal taints the venal poet's page  Yet grant a gracious smile if one remains  Who pours his honest tho' his humble strains  To pay th' important debt tho' all unfit  The debt of gratitude to thee and Pitt  Thy heart great George with virtue's lore enlarg'd  This generous debt of gratitude discharg'd  Then sure the sons of slander must agree  Who wound Pitt's merits glance the dart at thee  Who but remembers ah who can forget  When faction's rage distress'd the tottering state  When discontent thro' every bosom spread  And torn by parties Britain's vitals bled  A hateful scenethe Patriot then arose  At once the wounds of fell division close  On Britain's shore fair Union took her stand  And wide diffus'd her blessings o'er the land  Ere scandal lay dispirited and dead  And murmuring faction hid her horrid head  Blest daysO muchlov'd Britain still 'tis mine  To wish such halcyon days be ever thine  Why need I paint the virtues of his heart  Where rigid honour fills the largest part  The virtues of his heart are not unknown  These his disgusted enemies will own  And let not Falshood's voice my verse defame  And stain fair Truth with Flattery's odious name  When place and power obey'd the Statesman's will  The generous Muse ne'er tried her trembling quill  For tho' each action heartfelt joy inspir'd  Each action still in silence she admir'd  And now no statesman's character I blast  Nor blame the present tho' applaud the past  Exalted merit still to praise be mine  ****** to blast bright characters be Thine  When rolling time has bid our passions cease  And hateful faction shall be hush'd to peace  Then future ages shall his virtues know  And wonder such a Statseman

fairest page inscribe his name  And give the roll to everlasting fame  A JOURNEY TO DONCASTER OR A CURIOUS JOURNAL OF FIVE DAYS WROTE WITH A PENCIL IN A CHAISE  DEAR ANNE  IN prose I've wrote you many a journal  Of travels which I hope you'll burn all  And now for once I write in rhyme  To tell you how I spend my time  And what adventures may ensue  While I am hasting down to you  On Sep the second day I went  To London from my house in Kent  And as good luck would have it found  A friend for shire of Ebor bound  It proving temperate pleasant weather  We soon agreed to go together  And for our ease o'er turnpikeways  To travel down in my postchaise  By learned men it is agreed  Poets should ride the winged steed  And therefore thus says Betty Martin  " Thou art no poet that's most certain"  Thro' Kentishtown up Highgatehill  Our horses moveagainst their will  And while they snuff the wholesome wind  We cast a parting look behind  Pleas'd t' have left yon sable cloud  That buries millions in its shroud  Alas they toil the sons of care  And never breathe the purer air  Thy common Finchley next we measure  Whose woodland views would give us pleasure  But that they many a wretch exhibit  Too near the high road on a gibbet  Hence men may guess without much skill  Here have been roguesand may be still  HighBarnet pass'd we reach the plain  Where Warwick haughty earl was slain  So perish all as Warwick fell  Who 'gainst their lawful liege rebel  Ah passing strange that one sweet flower  Should kindle all the rage of power  Yet England oft has wail'd her woes  And wept the colours of the rose  With hungry appetites we hie on  Where Hatfield shows the Silver Lion  But lo nice steaks from rump of beef  Will soon afford us kind relief  Of good old Port we drink a quart  Discharge our reckoning and depart  Thro' sandy lanes and deep defiles  Where ray of Phoebus never smiles  Save on that beamillumin'd dwelling  Where Young delights the Muse at Welling  We march as gently as we can  And reach at Stevenage the Swan  A wellfed pullet roasted nice  And of highseason'd ham a slice  Of suppers could not prove the worst  Warm negus gratified our thirst  At ten the welcome down we prest  And wooed the kindly Power of rest  With early dawn we mount the chaise  And Phoebus smiles in friendly rays  O'er finest turnpikeroad we bowl  The wheels the numbers gently roll  Speed swift to Baldock down the hill  Where liv'd sweet Polly of the Mill  But now the lovely Polly's gone  Rival of Venusso drive on  Thro' villages o'er plains we ride  Where Ouze conducts his silver tide  So slow his winding waters stray  He seems to linger on his way  As loth to leave the pleasing scene  Of woods cornfields and pastures green  Thus man lowgrovelling like the river  Would loiter in this life for ever  So beautiful these scenes appear  He thinks it better to be here  Than try that country from whose bourn  No paleeyed travellers return  At Eaton next by twelve a clock  We bait our horses at the Cock  Then leave awhile the public road  To take with friends a night's abode  This visit comes in due succession  And therefore deem it no digression  Thence cross cornfields our way explore  Where chariots never went before  Thro' rushy swamps and bogs we past  And came to  The name of a small hamlet  Beggary at last  Even then we did not know our doom  For worse misfortunes were to come  Fain would we thro' the pastures ride  Our entrance gates and locks denied  Thro' that deep lane where many a slough  Would spoil a horse or hide a cow  Pass on we must if we intend  To pay our visit to a friend  True friendship has a bias strong  It drove us thro' the mire along  O'er banks and ridges till at last  It fairly set the carriage fast  What's to be donewith might and main  We haul'd it on the land again  At length with fear and wild amaze  We crawl'd thro' safely with the chaise  Now on the precipice's edge  Now bounc'd against a quickset hedge  And by a wondrous kind of fate  By four arriv'd at P's gate  Whose entertainment neat and kind  Soon put these dangers out of mind  With social friends we past the day  And gaily laugh'd our cares away  At six we march but first provide  To shun bad roads a faithful guide  And shortly o'er the rising steep  We saw the spire of Bugden peep  At breakfast near an hour we waste  'Twas coffee grateful to the taste  With dulcet cream and nutbrown toast  Then bid a Valeas to our host  O'er level roads we drive amain  Roads as the wellroll'd terrace plain  And soon reach'd Stilton safe and well  We chose the inn that bears the Bell  On mutton charming food we dine  And cheer our hearts with generous wine  But long alas we must not stay  Life flies with rapid wing away  'Tis but a march that we must make  'Tis but a journey we must take  Here we can fix no firm abode  Nor loiter long upon the road  But must with vigilance attend  Still to our journey and its end  At Stamford next with spirits light  The Bull receives us for the night  Smelts and a rabbet was our food  The bill was cheap the wine was good  Our wheels next morning early sound  O'er rough thro' truly Roman ground  Th' immense Vestigia still compleat  Prove that the Romans once were great  By ten at Grantham we admire  The noble church the lofty spire  Sarum's alone is two feet higher  Here what before I ne'er had seen  I saw fair Venus Beauty's Queen  Sweetly she smil'd with graceful look  In shape of Lady Mary C  Our breakfast done in haste we went  To Newark on the banks of Trent  There staid a little to regale  On cold roastbeef and humming ale  Thence thro' a tedious sandy way  We labour'd and at Carlton lay  With friends we drain'd the cheerful bowl  And supt on mutton and broil'd fowl  And eels that gave us much content  Delicious eelsthe eels of Trent  Next morn thro' wretched roads we steer  Yet pay at turnpikes devilish dear  The purple heath we travers'd o'er  And stopt at Barnby on the Moor  Thence into honest Yorkshire ventur'd  Which first we at fair Bawtry enter'd  By three to Doncaster we came  A town polite of antient fame  There will the Muse awhile unbend  And there this tedious journal end  Wrote dearest Anne at your commands  And now it flies to kiss your hands  Sep  SONNET  BY THE LATE MR EDWARDS  TO THE REV MR LAWRY PREBENDARY OF ROCHESTER  LAwry whose blissful lot has plac'd thee near  To

THE SENTIMENTS OF TRUTH AN EPISTLE  ADDRESSED TO THE SONS OF BRITAIN  BY MR PY  YE generous Britons sons of fair renown  With mute attention deign to lend an ear  As late reclin'd beneath a spreading oak  Musing intent on Albion's happy isle  A sudden slumber gently seal'd my eyes  And wrapt my wearied limbs in soft repose  Excursive Fancy wing'd her agile flight  Thro' the aerial mansions of the world  Instant appear'd portray'd upon my mind  The fair Urania clad in candid robe  And bright around in beauteous order rang'd  A crowd of Britons rising to my view  A gentle murmur first distinct was heard  The Goddess wav'd her wanda pause ensued  Silent in expectation now they sat  When thus her sentiments she mildly spoke  " Fam'd Albion's sons whose rockencircling coast  " Emblem of virtues in your noble race  " Repels each boisterous billow of the deep  " And stands triumphant o'er the bounding main  " You who to vindicate your regal right  " That right divine by every kingdom claim'd  " In dreadful thunder shook the distant poles  " While trembling regions heard the horrid sound  " Let not Contention hell's destructive fiend  " Excite commotion and your peace destroy  " Let not Ambition's vile ignoble train  " The groveling arts of dark dissimulation  " Pride pique or interest e'er delude your steps  " But let benevolence your souls command  " Your darling passion by your foes confess'd  " Can you who brave repell'd th' insidious foe  " And nobly humbled their imperious crest  " Can you so highrenown'd for martial deeds  " And fair emprise to discord fall a prey  " Instant renounce each stupor of the soul  " And virtuous dare the fam'd Britannia's weal  " Remember Rome august imperial Rome  " She long in virtue's cause resplendent shone  " Fragrant she bloom'd and flourish'd wondrous fair  " Till pomp vile luxury corruption fell  " And Hydra Faction with malignant breath  " Tumbled with cumbrous fall her eaglehead  " This world's dread empress renown'd for learning  " For arms arts virtuous deeds without compeer  " Now how inglorious how supinely sunk  " Fallen from her high estate and grovelling in the dust  " Since reason's lamp illuminates the mind  " And cogent proves eternity to man  " Since justice too eternal will require  " Strict retribution for offences past  " Serious reflect on God's supreme decrees  " And learn obedience to his great commands  " For what avail earth's pageant pomp and joys  " In that dread hour when death terrific comes  " The gaudy title silken dalliance  " And life too gaily spent will but torment  " Not calm the mind in that tremendous moment  " Let then your civil broils and discord cease  " Enjoy the fruits of your wellearn'd renown  " Cast off each vice each poisonous dreg of life  " Fly fell corruption taint of generous minds  " Lest her corroding hand your frame dissolve  " And bury in the dust your antient toil  " But if unheeded exhortation pass  " Britannia now so fam'd will sure imbibe  " A deeper stain than Afric's tawny sons"  She said then instant vanish'd into air  When Morpheus soon his guardian post resign'd  And memory faithful stamp'd upon my mind  The sage

XIV BOOK II  IMITATED BY JOHN EARL OF CORKE  HOW swift alas the rolling years  Haste to devour their destin'd prey  A moth each winged moment bears  Which still in vain the stationers  From the dead authors sweep away  And troops of cankerworms with secret pride  Thro' gay vermilion leaves and gilded covers glide  Great Bavius should thy critic vein  Each day supply the teeming press  Should'st thou of ink whole rivers drain  Not one octavo shall remain  To show thy learning and address  Oblivion drags them to her silent cell  Where brave king Arthur and his nobles dwell  Authors of every size and name  Knights 'squires and doctors of all colours  From the pursuit of lasting fame  Reliving there a mansion claim  Behold the fate of modern scholars  Why will you then with hope delusive led  For various readings toil which never will be read  With silver clasp and cornerplate  You fortify the favourite book  Fear not from worms or time your fate  More cruel foes your works await  The butler with th' impatient cook  And pastrynymphs with trunk makers combine  To ease the groaning shelves and spoil the fair design  HORACE ODE XXX BOOK I  IMITATED IN THE PERSON OF GENERAL CHLL  BY DR

Thee Goddess thee my prayers invoke  To thee alone my altars smoke  O treat me not with rigour  Thy wanton son bring with thee too  My dying embers to renew  And give me back my vigour  Bring too the Graces to my arms  Girls that are prodigal of charms  Of every favour lavish  Yielding and melting let them be  Consider I am sixtythree  And that's no age to ravish  Let jocund Health attend thy
