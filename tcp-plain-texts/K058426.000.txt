 THE LOVER'S TREAT OR Unnatural Hatred BEING A True NARRATIVE as deliver'd to the Author by one of the Family who was principally concern'd in the following Account  Written by Mrs  CHARKE  Author of  Dumont  and Miss  Charlotte Evelyn  Her lower Weeds were patch'd with different  Colour'd Rags as black red white yellow And  Seem'd to speak Variety of Wretchedness  CHAMONT in the Orphan  LONDON  Printed and Sold at BAILEY's PrintingOffice at the  Ship  and  Crown  in  LeadenhallStreet  where Tradesmen's Bills are Printed neat and Reasonable  THE Lover's Treat or UNNATURAL HATRED c  IN this last Century there has been no Vice more generally rooted in the Minds of Men than a Discordency in Families and which flows from the very Springs from which we should naturally expect to find the most agreeable Harmony but Interest whose Power is invincible too frequently creates us Enemies where we are most nearly and Consanguinity which ought most especially to endear to each other is now become a standing Maxim to forget those tender Principles which Nature claims and the World must necessarily approve  This unfortunate Depravity of Sense laid want of fraternal Affection was the unhappy Cause of many Sufferings and severest Hardships which a very worthy Youth for many Years endured and from whom I had a particular Account of a long Series of Misery occasioned by his elder Brother and since I have his Permission will give a succinct Account both of him and his Family  This young Gentleman was the second and last Son of Mr  Anthony Elstone  born of a very reputable Family in  Gloucestershire  and whose Father was a wealthy Grazier worth a considerable  Deal of Money but having a very large Family to whom he paid an equal regard He portion'd out his Sons and Daughters alike often declaring that one Child was as dear to him as another and that what he was worth was the happy Effects of his own Industry so he was determined to dispose it in such a Manner that no Envy should arise among his Children from his Partiality having ten of them he left to each when died One Thousand Pounds a piece and as a farther Proof of his paternal Affection his Wife dying when the Youngest of his Offspring was but two Years of Age he resolved never to make a second Choice in respect to the Memory of a very worthy Woman and a fond Regard to the infant Blood she left behind her he look'd on every Child as a particular Blessing sent from Heaven and as such resolved never to put it in the Power of a MotherinLaw to contradict his pious Purposes in acting like a tender Father or enumerating his Issue And consequently obliging himself to divest those he had Part of their natural Rights to provide for a foreign Stock  Many Years before he died he had the Happinness of seeing even the Youngest of his Children disposed of in different Callings and set up for themselves amongst which Mr  Anthony Elslone  his Youngest was well established in Merchandize in the City of  London  and behaving extreamly well in his Clerkship he married a Niece of his Master's who was a Dependant on her Uncle who gave her to Mr  Elstone  with a Fortune of Two Thousand Pounds and would have done more but that he had a Family of his own to provide for by this young Gentlewoman he had several little ones all of whom died in their Infancy except the last three  viz Anthony  the Eldest  George  the second Son and  Jane  their last and only Daughter who were Twins  Anthony  and  George  were as opposite in their Dispositions as Fire and Water the elder being the first that lived up to a Twelvemonth the fond Parents by an over acted Indulgence  ruined his Principles which in Infancy might have been Cultivated to have rendered him the reverse of which be proved by that Time he was six Years of Age he was absolute Master of the Family and was passed off as Life and Spirit in one so Young very soon made him hateful and contemptible to all about him except his Father and Mother in about four Years after his Birth their second Son and only Daughter made their Appearance in the World to the unspeakable transport of their Parents and the Admiration of all who beheld them being without Exception two of the finest Children that even were born at one Birth Young as  Anthony  was he conceived an Aversion for his little Brother and Sister and grew jealous at the Sight of them this rancourous Disposition grew up with him and strengthened with his Years the other two whose tender Dispositions and Affability of Soul inclined them to love each other also excited them to sue for  Anthony'  Affection but all in vain he openly declared his Aversion thro' every Action of his Life and several Times even at Play attempting to maim or destroy them This wicked Disposition was once the Occasion of his Father's stripping him starknaked and disciplin'd him with a Horsewhip till he  had  almost left him for dead it happen'd Mr  Elsione  luckily went into the Room when he was within an Inch of rushing a sharp Penknife into his Brother's Throat which naturally enraged the Father and urged him to excuse the forementioned Justice on him  Notwithsanding Mr  Elstone  's Reason convienced him of the Justice of the Punishment he had inflicted yet when his Anger subsided Fondness then prevailed and reduced the piteous Father to an immoderate Flood of Anguish and repeneant Tears for having proceeded with such Vigiour to his darling worthless Son Master  George  tenderly pleaded for his Brother and would have prevented the dreadful Stripes he underwent but even that wrought no Effect upon the Mind of this young Barbarian for he remembered the Smart of the  Whip  to a long and cruel Detriment to his Brother's Interest and Reputation  Mr  Elstone  had been often heard to declare his Intention of providing for his Family by the worthy Example of his Father this catch'd the Ears of his Son  Anthony  who from twelve Years of Age to Maturity industriously employed his Thoughts to Engross the  Whole  of what his  Father  should die possessed of To which End he made it his constant Business to influence his Father against his Brother  George  whose continual Obedience and Regard made it a very difficult Task For Example Even in Infancy he was unexceptionably endearing to his Parents through a continued Course of GoodNature at the same Time giving promising Hopes of an extraordinary Undertaking when ripen'd into Years in his School Days he made his Studies his peculiar Care and by that Time he arrived to the Age of Sixteen was Master of several Languages and as he was designed to follow his Father's Business closely applied himself to the perfect Knowledge of Merchants Accompts of which he is justly esteemed to be at this Time the compleatest Master in  GreatBritain  His Brother  Anthony  was as entirely regardless of every Advantage of this Nature Mis making chief and Pleasure his only Study and having from the Hour of his Birth gain'd such an Ascendency over the Hearts of both his Parents they found it an impacticable Scheme ever to get the better of that Power their mistaken Fondness had invested him with▪ Mr  Elstone  was too plainly convinced of the rancourous Disposition of  Anthony  to  inoffensive Brother therefore tenderly admonish'd his Son  George  to be contented with being put Apprentice to some other Merchant to prevent any Feuds or Animosities between 'em tho' he originally designed to have bound him to himself The good  Youth  received his Father's Advice with that dutiful Respect that became him tho' sorry to be obliged to leave his Father and greatly affected with  the unnatural and cruel Motive of their Separation In a short Time Mr  George  was put Clerk to one Mr  Hume  an eminent  Hamburgh  Merchant and seldom visited home above twice or thrice a Year tho' Mr  Elstone  often went to see him this Removal any reasonable Person would have thought might have made his  Brother  perfectly easy but so far from it the constant Praises he heard of his  Brother  's good Behaviour and Assiduity in his Business greatly corroded his Mind as he knew that this universal good Character must entirely frustrate all his wicked Intents of depriving him of his Birth right and that any Falshoods he could alledge against him must consequently prove ineffectual but in order to give Birth to his cruel Purposes he suddenly put on a Mask of Friendship and feign'd a hearty Repentance for his unnatural Behaviour to his  Brother  earnestly requesting his Father to become his Advocate to poor  George  and endeavour at his Reconciliation with him Mr  Elstone  and his Wife were pleasingly amazed at this wonderful and happy Charge in their Son's temper and without delay sent for the other home to close this unlucky Breach and six a wish'd for Friendship between the  Brothers  Mr  Elstene  urged his Son  Anthony  to write but the artful villain pretended he should be at a Loss to Express himself in a Manner suitable to his Offence and begged his Father for that Reason to do it for him to which he joyfully agreed as follows  DEAR GEORGE  'TIS with amazing and unspeakable Transport I inform you that your Brother  Anthony  is at last grown sensible of his Error and feels so strong Compunction for his ill grounded Aversion to you he can no longer forbear suing for a Reconciliation and as he confessed himself unequal to the Task of moving for it as he ought has entreated me to be his Mediator I don't in this Case use the Commands of a Parent but the tender Admonition of a Friend which I hope will be sufficiently prevalent on your GoodNature to come on the Receipt of this to fix a lasting  union between you which will be an infallible Joy to your Mother and Sister as also to dear  George's  most tenderly affectionate Father ANTHONY ELSTONE  Mr  George  's good Sense and Sweetness of Temper was easily moved to obey his Father's pleasing Summons and went directly with the Servant who brought the Letter to him On his approaching to embrace his deceitful  Brother  he shewed the real Signs of Love real Pity and Forgiveness while the the other artfully strain'd from his Eyes the Crocodile's pretending Sorrow which influenced the generous  Youth  to pay a sincere and grateful Retribution flowing from the Result of an  honest  Heart and Joy un  eign'd  When his Brother attempted to make Confession of his Error he would not permit him to proceed in but with the politest Tenderness desired him to regard but as a Dream what had passed and make at once to all the Transport of belonging and being beloved by a truly affectionate Friend and Brother  Mr and Mrs  Elstone  with their agreeable  Daughter  bore an equal Part in this pleasing Distress for such  they  thought it to be in regard to Mr  Anthony  who affected every Symptom without feeling the smallest Degree of it  however  it passed current upon the worthy Part of  the  Family who were esolved on  this  seeming Happiness to celebate it  with  a Festival and as  the  Discord between  these Brothers  was universally known among  their  Friends and Acquaintance Many of  them  were invited to a publick Rejoicing each congratulating the  whole  Family on so laudable and reasonable a Reconciliation  'Tis necessary to inform the Reader that Mr  George  and Miss  Jenny  who came together into the World went Hand in Hand in every Point of Brother and Sisterly Affection and on  such Terms as ought to stand for an Example to all such Relations though singly born But alas those Principles are lost in this present Age and is almost deemed a Crime in some Families to he related to them  The tender Regard this young Gentleman and his Sister from Infancy preserved for each other tho' entirely innocent and infallible was the first Motive thro' the Villainy of  Anthony  to their long and unprecedented Sufferings  The Day appointed for their public Rejoicing being come among their numerous Friends were Mr  George  's Master and his only Son who had for very near a Twelvemonth paid his Addresses to Miss  Jenny  by Consent of both Parties who thought proper to defer their Marriage till her Admirer had served his Clerkship which he did to his Father by which Time he would arrive to the Age of Two and Twenty and the young Lady to about Nineteen As they were happy in the Knowledge of being designed for each other entirely correspondent to their Wishes they passed their Time with agreeable Chearfulness and a pleasing Reflection of being one Day till Death to be rendered inseparab  e they were so near their destin'd Happiness that it wanted but three Months to confirm it which was Part of the Discourse at their Feast and gave Birth to a very barbarous Plot both on them and poor Mr  George  which Mr  Anthony  put in force  Mr  Elstone  being resolved to express the Fullness of his Joy on this Occasion concluded his Entertainment with a Ball and because Miss  Jenny  would not seem particular chose her Brother  George  for a Partner instead of young Mr  Hume  her intended Husband 'Tis true he entreated her to dance with him but she modestly declined it for the formentioned Reason as People are apt to take Notice of every Look and Action of a young Couple so near Marriage  Accordingly Mr  George  and his Sister both of whom danced most excessively genteel open'd the Ball with a Minuet and Louvre and continued Partners for the Night the whole Company were in a Flow of Spi its and good Humour except the villainous Hypocrite on whose Account these goodnatured People were all assembled next Day this Monster of Inhumanity and Falshood goes to pay a Visit at Mr  Hume  's under a Pretence of strengthening that Affection he had the Night before wav'd for his injured Brother he staid some Time expatiating on  George  's kind forgiving Nature and condemning his own mistaken Folly in being blind to so much Merit and obstinately depriving himself for so many Years of his fraternal Love and Friendship During  his  stay at Mr  Hume  's Mr  George Elslone  was obliged to go out for an Hour upon Business of very great Consequence but made his Brother promise to stay and pass the Evening with  them  to which  he  readily agreed While Mr  George  was gone young Mr  Hume  's Fondness naturally turn'd his Discourse upon dear Miss  Jenny  expressing the tenderest Regard for her and the Happiness he promised to himself when he should become her Husband Ah said  Anthony  with a kind of a Sneer in his Countenance  'tis all a Lottery some Blanks some Prizes Women are dangerous Things to encounter  And the very best of them according to the old Phrase  Won't upon Trial have much Goodness to spare  adding that for his Part if he owed any Man a Spleen he'd advise  him  to marry but if  he  were his Friend  he'd  sonner offer him a Knife or a Pistol than propose a Match for him and so you'd say too if you knew as much of the Sex  said be  as I do perhaps  said Mr Hume  you have met with some Disappointment but that should not urge you to an open War with the rest of Womenkind but be it as it may I'm fully persuaded that your Sister is intirely exempt from any of the Follies or Imperfections which are I own too incidental to Females and till I find her wrong 'tis my Duty and my Interest to believe  her  in the Right Why  says Anthony  did I say she was not No  says the other  but you were speaking in reference to Women in general And tho'  I am naturally inclined to be partial to  them  all I cannot help on every Occasion to express the tenderest Sentiments of my Soul for her whom  Honour  and  Love  equally  have  fix'd in my Heart a most implicit Regard for Well well  replied Anthony  these are all very fine  lights and I know you think this Opinion will last as long as you live yet I'll hold youfifty Guineas that I alter it in less than a Quarter of an Hour And says Mr  Huine  I'll hold you a Hundred to Fifty you don't done  says the other  done again  says Mr Hume  neither you or the World combin'd together will ever be able to alter my present Thoughts in regard to your Sister You'll stand to the Wager  says Anthony  I will  says young Hume  and now exert your utmost Skill to win it but I pronounce you the Loser before you begin upon which this wicked Wretch takes out of his Pocket a forged Letter directed to Miss  Jenny Elstone  which  he  pretended she had carelessly left in her Escrutore which stood open upon her being hastily call'd down to her Mamma that he accidentally coming in and seeing it to be a Man's Hand to which  he  was a Stranger  he  had a Curiosity to discover the Contents which  he  read to young  Hume  as follows  My Soul's Idol  HOW unhappy am I in being disappointed of the Pleasure of seeing you this Evening at the usual Place the sweet Remembrance of our last Interview doubly excites my impatient Love to intreat you if possible to slip out but for a few Moments and as the Family are busied in Rejoicing you'll not be so easily miss'd for the short Time I beg you'll spare to fix the next happy Meeting of  Your truly tender and affectionate Lover J B  PS  Your Brother  George  who was my friendly Advocate and since the faithful Confident of our Loves assured me I should see you if but for a Moment Remember my Love I only live while you are present  Now Sir  said he  what think you Why really Mr  Elstone  that  this  Letter is a villainous Contrivance to blast  both  your  Brother  and  Sister  's Reputation rather than that  they  are the least concern'd in it  there  is no single Action of  either  of  their  Lives that proclaims  them  capable of so monstrous a Crime and so far from being accessary to Miss  Jenny  's Destruction I'm certain Mr  George  would lose his Life to preserve or vindicate  her  Honour and as that base Scroll so infamously Calls it in Question I think myself bound by all  the  Ties of Love and Friendship to find out the wicked  Author  of it and use him at  his  Villainy deserves nor will I rest 'till I have put my Resolution in force and as you are her  Brother  I think you ought to join in so honourable a Design even at the  Hazard  of your Life  Why that is my Intent  says Anthony  who was left dead with the Fears of being detected in  this  Villainy What I said of the Sex just now was only to see  how  far you was inclined to think well of  them  abstracted from my Sister in whom I know your Soul is wrapt and my Reason for  showing  you the Letter was as my  Brother  's Character suffers in  the  Contents and we having but within a few Hours healed up an unhappy Breach which  had  been from Infancy subsisting I thought proper to take  the  advice of a Friend in the clearing up this Point lest by undertaking it myself I might be deem'd fond of retracting the solemn Professions of our newborn Friendship and pleased to think my  Brother  guilty of a Crime which I'm certain his  honest  Nature would most abhor Therefore Mr  Hume  as I have open'd myself so freely to you let me prevail on you not to take the least Notice of it till we meet again I'll find an Opportunity to replace the Letter in  Jenny  's Escrutere and if I don't doubt but she'll take Notice then we may publickly endeavour to find out by whom and what Means it was there placed it must be by some of the Servants who may be reasonably judged as an Accomplice with the invidious Wretch whom I suppose has a wicked Design upon  her  Person and hopes to bring the Matter to bear  by blasting  her  Reputation with a forged Process of an Amour with  her  I know out eldest Clerk once made an Overture of Marriage but  Jenny  being engaged to you  he  was soon repulsed perhaps  his  Disoppointment  for I know he was extremely in Love with her  may have urged  him  to this wicked Design at least will endeavour to find it out agreed  said Mr Hume  and or a Day or two I give you my Word and Honour to be quite silent in the Affair nor drop the least Hint of it even to my Friend  George  These last Words gave  Anthony  new Spirits as they afforded him more Leisure to perpetrate his Cruelty and with less Hazard of being found out  Mr  George  returning home the three young Gentlemen concluded the Evening together  Anthony  still continuing to repeat the tenderest Sense of Obligations to his Brother and expressing the highest Satisfaction at their being reconciled it growing late Mr  Anthony  took Leave and went away full fraught with all the Mischief Hell itself could inspire with to perpetrate the wicked Means to destroy the Happiness and Peace of two Families  Next Morning  he  went out very early to pay a Visit to one Mrs  Grimes  an elderly Woman of decayed Circumstances and  Low Cunning  whose Son was Mr  Anthony  's Emanuenfis who writing several Sorts of exceeding good Hands he found him put for his Purpose being possessed of a Heart like his Mother's capable of any Evil by which he could get a Shilling This Mrs  Grimes  kept a little House near  Goodman'sFields  in which she entertain'd several Disorderly Women of the lowest Class among wh  ch Number Mr  Anthony  had a favourite Lady which served his turn as well as the finest or most elegant Creature Nature could produce having no other Sense of Love superior to that of a Brute deeming the only Happiness arising from that generous Passion consisted in the immediate Gratification which Animals  are capable of conceiving  Mr  Anthony  opened his whole Design to the old Woman which was to use the most effectual Means he could to get his poor Brother and Sister totally disinherited which if Mrs  Grimes  by being Assistant could bring to bear he promised her a reward of five Hundred Pounds and as earnest of his Intention gave her twenty Guineas to encourage her and her Son to put in practise every Method that could forward his barbarous Undertaking the Money was a sure Bait for both and she promised most faithfully to transact whatever he should employ her in Accordingly he told her all that had passed the Night before between him and Mr  Hume  in regard to the forged Letter and made her thoroughly acquainted with the Plan on which she was to proceed which when she had heard entirely out the old Jade burst into a Fit of Laughing at a Conceit which came into her wicked Head more immediately to confirm what he had insinuated to young Mr  Hume  pray tell me said she what Hour and at what Place this young Gentleman is to be found Oh replied  Anthony  you may always be sure to see him going to or returning from the  Exchange  at the usual Hours but you don't know him but I do Sir says the Son and his Father too pe  fectly well that's enough says the Mother you shall go and point him out to me and I warrant I do your Business at that Time they parted appointing to meet in the Evening to know the Success of their Negociation about the Hour of Twelve o'Clock away goes Madam and her Son and waited Mr  Hume  's coming to the  'Change  at his return from thence she follows him in a very poor Garb suited to her Purpose and implored his Charity which he refusing she still persisting in her Importunity till be growing tired hastily bid her begone upan which with an Air of Resentment she told him he need not be so short for 'twas in her Power to do him more Service by a secret Knowledge she had than his trifling Alms could possibly be of to her  And as a Proof she bid him not bespeak his Wedding Cloaths for she was well assured if he did they would be out of fashion for many Years before he'd want them This Declaration startled the young Gentleman and claimed his Attention as he knew  his Marriage was near at Hand he thought she must either know his Person or have a supernatural Understanding upon which he asked if she had any Knowledge of him she answered no nor could she charge her Memory with ever having seen him before but no Matter for that at first Sight of you I was rendered capable by the Linaments of your Face of teaching you to avoid a fatal Snare you'll suddenly fall into if you don't listen to what I can tell you said the old Beldam Mr  Hume  's Curiosity began to be raised so he ordered ber to go to a particular Public House giving her Sixpence and wait till he came not caring to be seen in the Streets with such an Object of Misery as she at that time appeared to be  He was not long after when to the great Surprize of the Man of the House he called for a Pint of Wine and a private Room ordering this old Trapes to follow him up Stairs upon which she directly told him in a kind of ambiguous Phrase all that was contained in the Letter Mr  Anthony  had read to him the Night before and tho' he gave no Credit to it at that Time he then began to be staggered in his Opinion and in short grew very uneasy after she had thoroughly work  d up his Imagination to an absolute Credulity of every Thing she uttered she told him though she was a Stranger to his Names she would be bound to tell him the first Letters of each and that if she thought it worth while to study about it in a very few Hours by her Art though he were himself to lock her up upon Condition she had her Books with her she'd tell him his Names entire Well  says he  to convince me of a Likelihood of it tell me directly the first Letters of my Christian and Sirname  J  said she is the first of the Christian and  H  the first of your Sirname Mr  Hume  was perfectly astonished and began to consider whether it was or was not possible for her to be Mistress of so much Art or whether she might not have had some private Intelligence of whom he was and did this to get Money from him but that he might be sure to trap her if he could he bid her if her Art extended so far to tell him any one Circumstance that would happen to him before he slept that I will Sir and to convince you that  I don't tell your Fortune for the Lucre of Gain as many Impostors do without knowing any Thing of the Matter You shan't give me a Farthing more than the Six pence I had of you in the Street but I'll tell you one Thing that shall happen before you go to Bed and I will meet you here Tomorrow and if I tell you Truth will leave it toyour own Houour to reward me as You think fit to which he agreed and appointed to meet her next Day at the same Time and Place And now let's hear what is to happen in particular to Night Pray Sir say she let me see your Hand which after she palm'd and peer'd over for about five Minutes she looked very stedfastly at him and told him there was a young Gentleman that he frequently conversed with and that to her thinking lived in the same House and for whom be had hitherto a very great Friendship but something would happen that very Night to break it off not that they would come to any high Word but a Foundation would be laid for a Coldness that would grow into a mutual Contempt of each other very speedily and that it would not be long before they came to Reparation Look ye Sir said she  I am the seventh Daughter of the seventh Son  a common Cant the real Professors of Fortune Telling make use on And I have studied very deeply to acquire the Knowledge I have in Fate and  ugh I am poor I know more than many who carry that He  ds very high but Misfortunes which were not in my Power to avert have reduced me to ask Charity but now Sir I'll take my Leave and wait you according to Appointment▪ Away the pretended Artist went to an Alehouse where her Son was to stay for her laughing in herself to think how dextrously she had imposed  n the young Gentleman's Credulity and pl  ing herself with the hopes of a handsome Reward from him Next Day poor Mr  Hume  went home to Dinner very disconsolate but was ashamed to tell the Cause of his Uneasiness for fear of being laughed at but when be inwardly  ed like  nt  "She had told him such Tale  it bore great Circumstance of Truth"  He was half distracted and waited with Impatience to see his Friend  Anthony  again that he might from him receive his Care to unlade his Breast from the Load of Grief it then sustained but as  he had given his Honour to be silent till they met again he concealed the Cause though twas too obvious from his Countenance that his Mind was disturbed as well it might when labouring with the conflictious Passions of Love Despair and Rage  Mr  Anthony  whose wicked Heart never rested till he had accomplished his barbarous Design prompted him to fly with eager Haste to his inferral Instruments where he found the old Caeature stripping out of her ragged Attire and so pleas'd at the Thoughts of her Adventure she had scarce Power to recite it for laughing However when he heard it he greatly approv'd the Scheme and ordered her to make a swinging Bowl of Punch to drink to the Success of her next Expedition to the  Royal Exchange  According to  her  Instructions  Anthony  posted away to young  Hume  to forward the Intent of making the  Breach  between him and Mr  George  that  she  might gain the greater Credit and be thereby more amply enabled to carry on the Plot and bring it speedily to Perfection among the rest of her Contrivances she advised Mr  Anthony  to engage his Sister to a Country Dancing which was to be at a noted private House of Distinction for the Ladies of Pleasure of the first Order and contrive a means for young  Hume  to know of  her  being there  which  would naturally confirm  his  growing Jealousy and corroborate all that could be invented to raise it a tristing Hint was sufficient And the Evening for  the  Ball was to be the old Lady's Undertaking at one  Lucas  's where every Thing was prepared in a very elegant Manner and the Ladies being all let into the Secret  they  and  their  Sparks were admonish'd too with the utmost Decorum and good Breeding but of that we shall treat hereafter Mr  Anthony  's present Business was to go and work upon poor Mr  Hume  whom  he  found sitting alone in the Compting House reading in a very melancholy Posture Why how now says  Anthony  why so pensive Arn't you well Indifferent replied Mr  Hume  I am a little chagrin'd in respect to the Letter you read to me last Night I have considered  on it very deeply since and confess notwithstanding my seeming lncredulity to you that I am greatly alarmed but to act upon bare Supposition strongly puzzles me as I am fond of your Sister and too tenacious of  her  Honour without some positive Proof of her Misconduct to accuse or condemn her but pray tell me Mr  Elstone  have you gain'd any farther Knowledge concerning the Affair Partly says the other but whether it may serve as Loop or Hinge to  hang  a doubt on I cannot absolutely say Poor impatient Mr  Hume  hastily demanded what it was expressing in his Countenance all the Agony of Horror and DistractionNay nay says  Anthony  put yourself out of Temper so unreasonably till you hear what it is▪ perhaps I may be mistaken in my Conjecture and you may be working yourself into a Disorder there is no Grounds for but in short I happened to over hear an Appointment between her and one of her particular intimates to go to a Ball and the Place appointed unless my Ears deceived me is one of the most infamous Houses in Town Do you know one  Lucas  a famous Retailer of Beauty in or about  White Chapel  Know her answered young  Hume  ▪ Aye too well she's one of the most notorious Bawds in  Christendom  sure Miss  Jenny  is not engaged to go thither if so I shall no longer doubt the Truth of  Letter but however that is easily found out and you and I will go there and confront her in her wickedness with all my Heart said  Anthony  but first let me find out whether 'tis so or no and if it is so I'll give you my Word to go with you for I am certain there can be no good Intent in a Meeting of that kind at such a Place that I'm well assured on said young  Hume  for I have experienced it for to tell you the Truth before I fell in Love with your Sister I had a ridiculous Affair of Gallantry there which cost me a monstrous Sum of Money and had it not been for my Attachmen  to Miss  Jenny  might have continued still but the strict Regard I paid to h  r brought me into a Resolution rever more  associate with the terrible Crew that reside in that House  ittle dreaming ever to hear so angelic a Creature as  Jenny  appears should scandalously resolve to herd with such a Set of  Devils but sure 'tis impossible added he yet be it as it may I'm resolved to know the Truth He then began to Question whether  George  was of the Party to which the other answer'd he was not certain nor was it very material to  Anthony  to bring him into that Scrape as he had two or three different Pleas for  George  's Ruin without making him a Party in their Affair to be short they concluded to come at the Bottom of Miss  Jenny  's Designs and  Anthony  shook Hands with  Hume  promising him to assist him in the Discovery with many Professions of the most solemn Friendship Mr  George  coming into the Room they changed their Discourse and  Anthony  seemed highly delighted that the Scene was chang'd between them and  George  on his Part answered his Falsehood with the tenderest Marks of real Love  As Mr  Hume  was not in a very extraordinary Humour for Campany  Anthony  took Leave and went to consult with his evil Counsellers what was farther to be do e to effect his cruel Purposes upon which the old Woman bid h  m if he could find out who was his Sister's most particular Intimate amongst the Females Oh I can tell you that directly there's one Miss  Edwards  in  ThamesStreet  who is  Jenny  's greatest Favourite among all her Acquaintance upon the least Summons  Jenny  will come into any Scheme of Pleasure so we'll serd her a Note and I believe I have some of Miss  Edwards  's Writing in my Pocket which your Son shall counterfeit and carry it directly to our House he's not known and may pass upon our Family for one of Mr  Edwards  's Servants  Accordingly he gives a Copy of Verses of Miss  Edwards  's Writing to young  Grimes  who directly wrote the following Epistle to Miss  Elstone  in a beautiful  Italian  Hand as follows  My dear  Miss Elstone  ON  Thursday  Evening I am ingaged to a Ceuntry Dancing among a Set of very agreeable People who though not your Acquaintance are my very good Friends and from the Account  they have heard of you from me are very desirous of your Company and to be ranked among the Number of your Friends I won't take any Denial so expect me to call on you about five in the Afternoon and I'll conduct you thiher in the mean Time endeavour to persuade your Brother  George  and Mr  Hume  lest we should want Partners 'tis the young Lady's Birth Day where we are to go and as 'tis to oblige her you'll confer a double Favour by accompanying  My dear Miss  Jenny  's Friend  ELIZABETH EDWARDS  PS  I won't ask your Brother  Anthony  he's so cross I know he'll refuse us  Young  Grimes  was dispatched with  this  Letter to Miss  Elstone  who sent back  her  Service to Miss  Edwards  and that she would be ready to wait on  her  if she'd call at the Hour appointed the  Thursday  following and begg'd her Pardon for not writing for her Mamma had Company and she was obliged to make Tea directly  Away comes  Grimes  with his Message which pleased Mr  Anthony  highly but when he said that there was Company the old Woman forgetting the Answer thro' fear cries out to her Son  Suppose the very Gentleman should be there  Why then says  Anthony  directly  My Sister would not have sent such an Answer  besides you Simpleton said he I knew 'twas impossible for Miss  Edwards  is at her Father's Country House at  Enfield  and don't come to Town this Fortnight this was the Reason why I pitch'd upon her to make the Appointment that's well enough  says the old Woman  then we are safe but what's to be done when Miss is to call upon your Sister Why says  Anthony Dick  here shall carry a Note to excuse her coming and intreat  Jenny  to take Coach directly and meet her at the Lady's House where they are to pass the Evening in the mean time do you be punctual to the Hour in which you are to  meet young  Hume  so at present farewell I won't go up to poll this Evening because I have no Time to lose therefore don't own I have been here Away he march'd home and was immediately accosted by his Sister who told him of her Invitation from Miss  Edwards  and tho' she expected to be refused she was resolved to try if the Brute would have Complaisance enough to squire her to the Bali which he peremptorily refused as she expected upon which his Mother chide him telling him she wonder'd he would not endeavour to polish himself a little and throw off that Roughness of Behaviour which he never had the least Example of either from his Father or Brother he answered that Dancing was no Entertainment to him and that  George  would be glad of the Opportunity so refered her to him  All that Evening young  Hume  and  George Elstone  were at home alone but Mr  Hume  seemed very cold and distant in his Discourse which greatly surprized poor Mr  George  who often kindly enquired into the Reason of his short Manner of speaking to him desiring to know wherein he had offended him to which the other sullenly replied Time would show he could not but own he was offended in the highest Degree and did not doubt but Mr  George  was sensible enough of the Occasion in this Manner they conversed for some Hours till they parted with a downright Querrel as well Mr  George  might to meet with such unexpected ill Treatment from his Friend without a Cause or knowing what was the Motive of so sudden and unkind a Change in the Temper of one who till that Time had ever treated bim with the utmost Marks of friendly Tenderness 'tis not to be supposed that either these Persons enjoyed much Rest that Night Next morning when they met Mr  Hume  be retained the sullen Mood he went to bed with Mr  George  being conscious of not having deserved this unaccountable Alieration in his Friend took as little Notice of him but each went to their Business without exchanging a Syllable at Change Time Mr  Hume  went out and from thence to his Appointment with his expected FortuneTellor who was punctual to a Minute he found her at  the Door of the Alehouse in the same tattered Trim she appeared in the Day before but as he thought the Landlord might wonder to see him twice together in such Company he beckon'd her to him before he got to the House and directed to another in the next Street when they were got together well Sir  says she  have I told you Truth  or no Indeed  says he  You have and though I'm not pleased at it yet I'm bound in Honour to reward You and directly gave her a Crown▪ which he supposed would be a valuable present for one in her seeming wretched Circumstance but Madam expected Gold not considering that many a FortuneTeller would have thought him an excellent Chap Now  says he  if you can tell me any Thing farther that is material I'll double that Sum tomorrow Ah Sir  said she  I can tell you any Thing you want to know but I wish you'd double the Sum now for I want to buy a few Cloaths to my Back for you see I'm very bare and to convince you that I'm skilled in my Art I have only this to say to You  Whatever you do listen to one particular Man who is your Friend  on which she described  Anthony  's Person to a Hair and gave him the first Letters of his Names to his very great Astonishment and afterwards describing  George  she bid him carefully avoid such a one assuring him that under the Mask of Friendship he was a bitter Enemy She also bid him beware of a fair Young Woman and farther added that where he loved most he had the least Occasion Now Sir I have said as much to You as I think will be serviceable to You and will take my Leave upon which he gave her another Crown and they parted Mr  Hume  first enjoining her to meet him again in two or three Days but she took Care not to keep her Word for fear through any Accident she might be found out  The Day being come when the Ball was to be Miss  Elstone  was very elegantly dressed waiting at home for Miss  Edwards  but inhead of the young Lady young  Grimes  brings a second Letter to request Miss  Jenny  would take Coach and come directly with their Man to wait on her there and begg'd her Excuse for not waiting on her herself for the young Lady  whose Birth Day it was had sent their Coach for her which had three more in it but that she was there ready to introduce her this passed Current with poor Miss and away she went with  Dick  behind the Coach to attend her when she came to the appointed Place she was received by the pretended young Lady with the highest Elegance and respectful Breeding Miss  Elstone  was under a good dea of Confusion when she found her Friend not there but the Lady who received her begged her not to be uneasy for Miss  Edwards  had been there and left her Compliments to her that she was only gone to persuade another young Lady to come whom nobody but Miss  Edwards  could prevail on to oblige them with their Company Tea was immediately ordered after which a Glass of Wine round but still no Miss  Edwards  appeared and Miss  Elstone  being among a Set of Strangers she began to grow very uneasy at last up came half a Dozen Beaus who were immediately addressing Miss  Elstone  who was an undoubted Beauty which was considerably heightened by an unaffected Modesty  At last the Musick came and with much Difficulty Miss  Elstone  was prevailed on to lead down one Dance which when ended she positively insined upon going home but as every Body there present had their Cues from Mr  Anthony  who paid the Expence of the whole Night's Entertainment she was not suffered to stir she was not only excessively uneasy but began to suspect by  her  Friend not appearing there was some design laid against her yet Miss  Edwards  's Hand being so well counterfeited she thought Herself wrong to suppose that so  worthy  a Young Lady would keep bad Company and began to be a little more composed but  the  Evening being pretty far spent she again insisted upon going Home but the Company one and all insisted upon her staying Supper to which she sat down but never eat a Morsel and upon attempting to slip out after the Cloth was taken away while they were pretending to settle a Dance she found the DiningRoom Door double lock'd upon which she shriek'd out crying Oh Heavens I'm undone she then began to reflect on  herself for not asking Mr  Hume  and her Brother  George  to be of the Party and found too late there was some wicked Fraud in the Affair the old Lady of the House seeing her burst into Tears ask'd her the Reason assuring her she was among Friends and that she was surprized she should discover such dreadful Signs of Uneasiness if Madam answer'd Miss  Jenny  I'm among Friends what is the Reason notwithstanding my frequent Solicitation to go home I've not only been detained against my Will but must have this Door lock'd upon me Why Child says the old Lady you won't think of going home till Morning there's a Bed for you 'tis my Daughter's Birth Day and we are resolved to make a Night on't at these Words Miss  Jenny  fell into a Soon and one fit was succeeded so fast by the other that they were obliged to undress and put her to Bed where when she came a little to herself and found how she was disposed she fell into strong Convulsions which lasted for a considerable Time the old Jade who kept the House began to repent having any Concern in the Affair and privately sent Word to Mr  Anthony  the Danger his Sister was in and that they might be rumed upon his Account He directly sent Word not to own to any living Mortal that she was there and that he would be with them early in the Morning and get her removed  About Ten the next Day he went and ill as she was being lightheaded in a violent Fever she was conveyed to Mother  Grimes  's House and put to Bed there in a Garret this secured Mrs  Lucas  and was the dreadful Means of poor Miss  Jenny  's being never after permitted to see her distracted Parents as they did not know the Place where she was as they thought to meet Miss  Edwards  'twas impossible for her to send but when it grew near Twelve o'Clock her Father took Coach to Mr  Edwards  's House but the Family were in Bed but he persisting in knocking at the Door a Servant looking out of Window he asked for his Daughter and Miss  Edwards  they told him their young Lady was down at  Endfield  and was not expected Home for a Fortnight and that  Miss  Elstone  had not been at their House for several Days past Mr  Elstone  returned home full of distracted Thoughts about his Child and through excessive Tenderness to his Wife who was just before gone to bed he concealed his Grief that Night but in the Morning it burst it's Passage through his Heart and Mrs  Elstone  was soon made the melancholy Partner of his Sorrow Mr  Anthony  was called on to assist in endeavouring to find her out and with a pretended Grief set out on that Occasion but in fact was carefully employed in removing his hapless Sister to that shocking Seat of Infamy beforementioned the whole Family were dispersed to different Parts of the Town but to no Purpose  Mr George  was sent for who was doubly assiduous in the pursuit of her and that she might be more likely to be found he advertised her and by his Father's Order offered a Thousand Pounds reward to any Person who should produce her Living or dead young  Mr Hume  was quite convinced that she was false and credited every Thing her Brother  Anthony  had insinuated against her but when the whole mischief was perfected by her wicked Brother and his Accomplices it had a different Effect on her Lover than either he or  Anthony  imagined for Despair and Grief reduced him to a raging madness which immediately seized him and he was obliged forthwith to be confined in a private noted Mad house at  Chelsea  after two or three Days ineffectual Search Her viliainous Brother with a mixture of pretended Grief and Anger produces the forged Letter he had shewn to poor young  Hume  and gave it his Father to read which when he had done he vow'd severest Vengeance on his Son  George  and as her Absence corroborated with the Contents no Arguments could convince him to the Contrary of what was inserted in the Letter  Mr Elstone  flew with the utmost Rage to  Mr Hume  's and shewed him the Letter which when poor  George  came to be acquainted with his Distress was not to be painted or conceived his  Father  and  Master  were equally enraged the one for the positive Loss of his Daughter and the other for the dreadful Apprehension of the Loss of his Son  Mr George  used all the Arguments he was master of to convince him how highly they all were injured by that Letter but to no Purpose  Mr Hume  gave up his Indentures and the Father forbid him from that Instant ever to see him more nor did he leave the Place till he saw his Son absolutely turned out of Doors The poor melancholy Youth went to a Friends House where he was very frequent in his Visits and was greatly esteemed as he truly deserved when he told the Story of his being deserted both by his  Father  and  Master  for a Fault he was not Guilty of nor ever could though reduced to the lowest Ebb of Fortune his Friend greatly pitied his Distress and promised him all the Assistance in his Power towards his Relief first he advised him to insist on his master's turning him over to another or permit him to serve out his Time with him but that  Mr George  declined till he had first endeavoured to clear up his Reputation with his Father which both he and his Friend took infinite Pains to do but to no Purpose so far from it that  Mr Jennison  who was the Person who espoused  Mr George  's Cause offering to be at any Expence towards finding out the Author of the Letter which had caused the Separation of the Father and Son he was desired never more to darken the Doors for any Person that would plead in  George  's Behalf would only be regarded in an equal Light  Mr Jennison  finding his Advocation out of tune resolved never to trouble the old Gentleman again but in every other Point to serve the unhappy Youth to the extent of his Power  Mrs  Elstone  despairing of ever seeing her Daughter more sickened and Languished out a few Weeks till Death terminated the most sincere and real Sorrow that maternal Fondness ever felt  Mr Anthony  took particular Care to behave with all the Duty and Affection to his Father that  Hypocrisy  was capable of acting and as an Addition to his Deceit upon the Father's Declaration of cutting off the Brother with a Shilling and  making him his sole Heir he begged him to forego so severe a Resolution as it must necessarily make him very unhappy to know he was possessed of an Affluence while they perhaps were wandering thro' the World in search of Bread  This seeming Tenderness made the fond believing Father still more a Friend to his worthless wicked Son and in short he settled the whole of what he was worth upon him and his Heirs for ever which when he came to possess would have made him Master of about Twenty Thousand Pounds As Mr  Elstone  was very industrious and successful in his Business he acquired in fewer Years than any Merchant had ever been known to do before him  Young  Mr Hume  's madness daily encreased and continued for the Space of fifteen months at the End of which Time he expired raving to the neverceasing Sorrow of his discensolate Father This young Gentleman's sad Catastrophe was the lucky means of preventing the Discovery of  Anthony  's Villainy for had he retained his Senses but an Hour after he heard of  Miss Jenny  's Departure from her Father's House he would undoubtedly have cleared up every Point as Circumstances would have so strongly concurred to have proved the Innocence of the abused Party and the unparallel'd Wickedness of him who was the base Contriver of this shocking Scene of Ruin  Poor  Miss Jenny  continued so very ill for near three Weeks that her Life was hourly despaired of which News pleased  Anthony  extreamly well but  Mrs Grimes  who always consulted her own Interest was resolved seeing her a beautiful Creature to spare neither Cost or Pains to restore her and as her Brother refused to advance a single Shilling upon that Score the old woman took  Miss  's Cloaths and Jewels in which she was brought to her House and sold them to the best Advantages which amounted to a considerable Value out of which she laid out about five Pounds to Cloath the poor unfortnate  Girl in a plain manner as soon as she was able to sit up and when she was tolerably recovered resolved to make her market of her and that she might be secure of her Prey she kept her locked up never suffering any mortal to go nigh her but herself and Son sti  l providing every Thing necessary for her and to poor Miss's Imagination behaving with the motherly Tenderness of a disinterested old Woman  This poor Girl on the Recovery of her Senses demanded by what means she was brought thither upon which the old Woman mumps up a Tale of seeing her in the Hands of wicked People and though a Stranger she rescued her from them and poor as she was had her brought Home to her House to prevent ill Usage she must unavoidably have met with where she was for do you know  Madam  said she the House you was brought from was no less than a common Brothel and if the wicked Jade who keeps it had not been frighted out of her Senses seeing you to be a Person of Condition you had not escaped so luckily but she knew I was too well acquainted with her Tricks and have it in my Power to hang her if I had a mind therefore was glad to let You go at any Rate I'm sure my poor old Heart bled to see your Danger and glad I am to find you are likely to do well again then forcing a dissembled Tear or two she desired miss to acquaint her with her Name and Family all which the infamous Wretch knew before but the poor unhappy Victim directly told her who she was and intreated her to take a Letter from her to her Father's House and go herself with it as she was best able to give an Account of the melancholy Cause of her Absence in short Letter after Letter was wrote for several Days but all committed to the Flames by  Mrs Grimes  who pretended that her Father would send no Answer And in fine that she was forbid ever to bring any more for he positively resolved never to see or hear of her again She told her her mother was dead on the Account the Loss of whom as she was looked on to be the Occasion of her Death greatly added to her Father's Anger which by all she could  learn was irrevocably fixed against her The poor Thing also wrote several Letters to her Brother  George  which met the same Fate of those intended for her Father Such a multiplicity of Sorrows might reasonably be thought sufficient to break an adamantine Heart but it pleased Heaven to preserve this unhappy maid and furnish her with Strength to bear the severest Griefs her Fate could possibly inflict when the old Woman brought her new plain Cloaths to put on she pretended they were her Daughter's which she lent her to save her own for which this poor Innocent was very thankful and thought herself highly obliged but on her being able to walk about and intreating to walk down Stairs she was terribly startled at  Mrs Grimes  refusing to let her out of the Room and still insisting to lock her in alledging that it was dangerous for her to go out lest she should be way laid and intrap'd by those wicked People she had redeemed her from besides said she you want for nothing and my Son and I will be with you as frequently as possible and till you have gathered Strength you are much better in your own Apartment than by catching cold run the Hazard of a Relapse Poor miss  Jenny  was in the Lion's Paws and obliged to Comply but began to have a Secret dread at  Richard  's Approach who had for his three or four last Visits pretended to be mighty fond of her and as she was too often in his Power she feared the C  nsequences of it which one Evening had liked to have proved very fatal had it not been for a sudden Accident which prevented it  Mrs Grimes  was gone out for the whole Day and left a strict Charge with her Son  Dick  to take all imaginable Care of poor  Jenny  which he promised very saithfully to do paying her several Visits and behaved very decently at last he proposed if she pleased to play a Game at Cards with her to pass away a few melancholy Hours which she with great Reluctancy at last consented to it growing pretty late in the Evening According to his Order the maid brought up a roasted Fowl for Supper and a Bowl of Punch  Dick  still behaving with the utmost Complaisance hIS mother not being come Home he entreated the Favour to  with her after Supper which he did till all the  Family  were gone to Bed except the maid who sat up for her mistress when he was quite assured that all was safe master  Richard  began to be very Amorous and thereby troublesome to the poor Soul who sat trembling  by  him with terrible Apprehensions of  his  using the horrid Power he had to do her the greatest Injury in the World at last he began to take such Freedoms as too plainly convinced her of his cruel Design on which she shrieked out and he being only possessed of a brutal Passion struck her menacing severest Vengeance on her if she dared to speak above her Breath telling her plainly he would not stirout of the Room till he had gained  his Ends  the poor Soul struggled with him till she had no longer Strength to resist him and throwing her on the Bed and intended Sacrifice to  his  Brutality before he could accomplish  his  wicked Purpose a dreadful Outery of Fire was heard in the Street and though a terrible Circumstance proved the happy means of Miss  Jenny  's Deliverance the very next Door was a very great Oilshop which was unhappily set on fire through the Carelessness of a Servant who was very sleepy going to Bed leaving the Candle in an old matted Chair and in less than two Hours most of the Houses were consumed on that Side of the Street  Dick  was alarmed at the Outery and ran down directly and poor  Jenny  after him as well as she could tho' more terrified at the Thoughts of the Danger she was in resolved within herself to take that Opportunity of escaping from her Prison late as it was was determined to sit all Night in the Street rather than run the Chance of being ruined by that infamous Fellow in her weak Condition  The Reader may suppose with the Addition of her Fright she must be terribly reducedRichard  in his Confusion never missed or thought of her till next Morning and could not very well tell whether she came out of the Room when he did or perished in the Flames for his Mother's House was reduced to Ashes before she came home when to her great surprize she found she had not a Place to shelter herself nor bed to lie on as the Neighbourhood in every Street about are naturally asarmed  at such dreadful Disasters Poor  Jenny  was luckily met by a goodnatured Man who was going to the Fire and perceiving by her Looks she was just come from it he advised her to go in and set down in the WatchHouse but she told him she had no Money and she supposed they would not let her set there for nothing upon which he conducted her and giving the Watchmen a Shilling with positive Orders to take Care of her that Night  In the morning she wandered to Mr  Hume  's in hopes of seeing her Brother  George  bat how great was her Amazement when she heard of his being turned away in the manner he was and when she was informed ofher Lover's Death she was like a distracted Creature farther she was told her Father had cut both her and Mr  George  off with a Shilling and made  Anthony  his sole Heir and that all was owing to her running away and  George  being thought accessary to it This Information she received from an old Servant of mr  Hume  's who was left in Care of his House till it was lett his master since his Son's Death having lest off Business and retired into the Country  Miss Jenny  assured the good man of her and her Brother's Innocence alledging that she found they had been both betrayed but by whom she could not tell she then requested him to go to her Father with a Letter but he assured her it would be a sruitless Attempt for he was so enraged he would not suffer her's or mr  George  's Name to be mentioned in his hearing what to do in this exquisite Distress she could not tell however one Gleam of Comfort appeared through all this Cloud of Sorrow for she got Information where to find mr  George  at mr  Jennison  's the goodnatured man sent for a Coach to conduct her thither and believing her to be quite Innocent and positively an injured Person slipped a Guinea into her Hand and wishing her better Fortune begged her not to be seen there again as it might endanger his losing his Place if it should be known When she arrived at mr  Jennison  's the Joy of seeing her Brother greatly alleviated her misery as the unexpected Interview did his they wept and kindly condoled each other's Fate but from what Cause it sprung they neither of them could imagine The Cause said mr  Jennison  is plain enough your Brother  Anthony  is at the Bottom on it as sure as Light and he has gain'd his point and take my word for it one Day or other when it may be too late his Villainy may be discovered However you may depend on this Friend  George  while I am master of a Shilling neither you or miss  Jenny  shall want though said he sighing Heaven only knows how long that may be for Things are not with me now as formerly as indeed it soon after proved for the poor Gentleman was in about six weeks Time obliged to step aside and all he was worth in the world was not sufficient to answer the large Demands upon him which was chiefly occasioned through considerable Losses in Trade  This unlucky stroke of Fortune drove poor  George  and his Sister into the wide World but they never separated shifting for three Years as well as they could for daily Bread Miss  Jenny  earned what she could by her Needle at best poor Subsistance And her Brother whose Credit was broke amongst the merchants undertook to teach those Accompts and kept a little School but with much Difficulty between them both could raise even a homely livelihood  Mrs  Grimes upon her misfortune went to mr Anthony Elstone to claim his Promise of the Five Hundred Pound which be would have declined as not being in immediate Possession of the Fortune but she insisted on a Bond which he gave her out of Fear of a Discovery As to his Sister she was concluded to have perished by the Fire as they had never heard any Thing of her since  As Providence has in itself several wonderful and surprising Turns I must now give a very remarkable Instance of its Care of poor  George  and his Sister  Jane  GEORGE's Reputation having been so cruelly blasted in  the  City He chose to reside at a different End of the Town for which Reason he took a couple of Rooms in one of the little Streets near  Red Lion Square  and in an Evening in the Summer Time would frequently take a walk with his Sister up as far as  Pancras  and at the End of one of  RedLion Fields  he had for many weeks observed a venerable clean old man who did not ask Charity but bowed with a submissive supplicating Look that claimed a Human Regard from every Passer by among the rest poor  George  and  Jenny  as often as they could would throw in their mites and with so tender and compassionate an Air it seemed rather an Obligation to themselves than to the Person on whom they bestowed their kind Benevolence the poor old man had taken particular Notice of this couple whom he took for man and wife but observed something in their Aspect and Deportment that declared them what they really were two well bred distressed People and resolved within himself the next Time he saw them to be better acquainted with them Soon after they took their Evening walk and the old man spying them at a Distance made towards them and met them half way the Field my good master said he I beg pardon for stopping you but  I  have been often obliged to your friendly Charity and am now come to thank you for it in a particular manner and if you will condescend to give a poor man your Company for few moments I'll conduct you to a House where we  can more freely converse than in this Place don't be offended Sir nor you my good mistress for what  I  have to say is worth Your Attenuca and if you should not approve of a Proposal  I  have to make You  I  can but ask your Pardon and trouble you no farther they answered him in a very good natured and obliging Manner and consented to walk back to  Powis Wells  where they called for a private Room and the old man to their great Surprize ordered a Cloath to be laid and the Table was spread in 'an instant' with a cold Fowl and a Place of Ham and a Bottle of Wine he threw aside his Crutches and begged of 'em not to be surprized if he took the Liberty to alter his Countenance which he did by taking of a long grey Beard and his worsted Cap and placing in its  a very neat bob wig he had in his Pocket This Tranformation discovered him to be a very handsome man very little more than forty Years of Age and when he pulled off his washleather Gloves to sit at Table made another Discovery of the finest and whitest Hand they had ever beheld he helped Mr  George  and his Sister in a very polite manner and before he eat drank a Glass of wine to a lasting F  endship between them which they very readily pledged  we have regaled  said he  if you are not in haste I'll tell you the Reason why I have asked this Favour of You and hope it will prove as agreeable to you as I have some Reason to believe it will be to me they soon finished their Collation and when the Things were taken away he ordered the Landlord not to let any body come to them till they rang which in a very respectful manner  he said  they should not on which he began asking mr  George  first of all whether they were man and wife And upon hearing they were only Brother and Sister they perceived an unusual Joy sparkle in his Eyes and begged the Favour of miss  Jenny  to favour him with the Privilege of saluting her which she did and now madam  said he  give me Leave to inform you that though I live by Charity I am better able to bestow it than three Parts of those from whom  I  receive  it but  I  hope as  I  design to do good with what  I  have got  I  shan't be blamed for the means by which  I  have acquired an immense Fortune and the first Step towards it  I  humbly offer that and an honest Heart to make you honourably happy for the remaining Part of Life  I  own madam  said he  this is a sudden Attack upon your modesty but as it flows from the Result of a tender Passion  I  have for some weeks past sustained for you  I  hope you will excuse this quick manner of requesting the only Blessing  I  wish to enjoy on Eath miss  Jenny  blushed and was at a Loss for words to express her Thanks and avoid the Appearance of being either forward in complying or impertinently rejecting if what he said was true must be a very advantageous offer but to prevent her Confusion her Brother answered for her intreating the Gentleman which he perceived he was not to insalt on a positive Answer till they were a little better acquainted for Sir  said he  we are two unfortunate Twins who have sustained very great injuries which have made us the outcast of our Families and cut us of from a very good inheritance which  I  believe would have amounted to near  Seven Thousand Pounds  a Piece Now Sir our misfortunes  have  taught us rather to increase that Store of Friendship we imbibed from infancy therefore thro' every Change of Life  I  am resolved to be a faithful Guardian to my Sister's Honour and protect her even at Life's Expence from any Danger she may be liable to not that  I  suspect any ill from You Sir and hope You will not be offended at my cautious Care for so dear and near a Relation No Sir replied the other  I  rather applaud than condemn You for it but as Earnest of my Truth I beg Sir You will do me the favour to accept of this Trifle for Your present Use putting into his Hand a Silk Purse with fifty Guineas in it Tomorrow  I  desire to see You and this fair Lady at my House by Dinner please to enquire for mr Cornish at the Two Red Lamps in DeanStreet Soho where you'll find every Thing  I  hope agreeable to You and your  Sister's Expectations I won't detain you longer but beg you to consider well on what I have offered and know me hereafter as a Friend and I hope a Brother they took leave and the Gentleman resumed his venerable Appearance and discharging the reckoning he went to his Stand till Evening and went home well pleased at his Afternoon's Adventure Mr  George  had a great deal of Reason to conceive a high Opinion of his new Acquaintance and advised his Sister to resolve upon the Match which she promis'd to do in case every thing answer'd to what he had told them  Next Day he went to  Deanstreet  and upon the Coach stopping at the Door was open'd by a footman in a lac'd Livery before the Coachman could get off his Box and Mr  Cornish  dress'd like a Man of Fashion ready to hand the Lady in whom he conducted into a very handsome DiningRoom splendidly Furnished and at one End a noble Sideboard of Plate fit for a Nobleman Now Madam said he permit me to bid you welcome to your House for that and all that it contains is Your's if you please to except of it she bow'd and blush'd and Mr  Cornish  continu'd paying his Addresses in the politest Manner possible Dinner was served at which there was fifteen Dishes five at a Course with the best the Season of the Year afforded when that Ceremony was over Mr  Cornish  brought Mr  Elstone  a Pocket  Book out of which he counted out Bank Notes to the amount of upwards of forty Thousand Pounds which he and his Father before him had amass'd by begging yet this is not all that I am worth for I have several Houses and have often received charity from my tenants in their coaches who at the same Time did not know they were relieving their Landlord I have but one Servant belonging to me that knows any thing of my Course of Life and he's an old Fellow that lived with my Father before my Remembrance he always attends me to our House of Rendezvous and is principal Secretary of our begging State in short they pass'd the Afternoon with a Recital of both their Fortunes and Mr  Cornish  heard of the Cruelty of  George  and  Jenny  's Fate he shed a kind commiserating Tear for both but most especially for Miss  Jenny  whom he loved and was pleased to find she had an equal share of sense and beauty After  they  had told their separate Tales Mr  Cornish  requested 'em to pass the Evening and as Mr  Elstone  was perfectly convinc'd of his being in all Points capable of making his Sister happy On Mr  Cornish  's moving his suit again 'twas concluded in a few Days to fix their Widding which was at  Queen'sSquare  Chapel near  Ormondstreet  and as Mr  Cornish  was King of the Begging Crew there was a grand Festival held the next Day at their House of Rendezvous where he resigned his Throne to another  allowing a  Yearly Pension  to support the Dignity of their Society which was kept in more exact Order and strict Decorum than some Constitutions which might fare much better if they were governed by their Example  The Wedding was kept at home with great Splendor where was present a young Lady of ten Thousand Pound Fortune who changed Hearts at first Sight with Mr  Elstone  but he not having it in his Power to address the young Lady for want of an equivalent Stipend he heartily sigh'd for her till his BrotherinLaw perceiving him grow melancholy enquiring into the Cause soon made up the Match to the unspeakable Satisfaction of both Parties  As Providence had been careful in rewarding these injured Innocents so was it no less concerned in punishing the Guilty as will appear by the powerful End of Mr  Anthony  who was in a Visit to Mr  Hume  attack'd on the Road by a party of  Highwaymen  whom he endeavoured to rest but they resolvidg on their Booty shot at him which not proving effectual they drew their Hangers and stabbed him in different Parts of his  Body  and left him weltering in his Blood upon the Road where he soon expired The  Highwaymen  made off and the Deceased was soon own'd  by  some Passengers coming along the Road the News was directly carried to town to his Father who griev'd much for him till in a few Days upon searching in his Closet he found several Papers under his  own Hand which fully discovered the  Villainy  he had been  Guilty  of to his injured  Brother  and  Sister  Mr  Elstone  greatly condemn'd his  hasty Credulity  to the Ruin of as he fear'd of his  unhappy  Son and Daughter nor did he know whether they were living or dead his old Friend Mr  Hume  upon hearing the News of  Anthony  's Death came to town to pay him a Visit of Condolence but when he saw the Memorials of his  Villainy  to his  Brother  and  Sister  he rather congratulated him on the  happy  Ridance of so infamous a burden and disgrace to his  Family  but now said Mr  Hume  Your business is to make a strict  Enquiry  after  your  abused Children and  by  a tender Reconciliation endeavour to make them the best amends  you  can for all their Sufferings the  only ready  Means is to advertise in case  they  are living that if  they  will return to
