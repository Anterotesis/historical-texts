 THE  SICK MONKEY  A FABLE  Thursday Afternoon DAVID GARRICK  Esq  arrived at his House in SouthamptonStreet CoventGarden  Public Advertiser April  LONDON Printed for J FLETCHER and Co in St Paul's ChurchYard MDCCLXV  THE SICK MONKEY A FABLE  ADDRESSED To Mr GARRICK upon his ARRIVAL  RETURN'D from travel to your native shore  Again to make us laugh or cry  To turn your back we hope no more  Nor from your colours fly  Whether you fled for health or quiet  Harrass'd with rule or sick of riot  Or whether you have kept us lean  As slander says  With lenten plays  To make our appetites more keen  Whether it be or this or that  No matter what  For we before the curtain see but blindly  Now you are come  To us and home  We greet you Sir and greet you kindly  My Muse is honest as she's bold  A forward Miss  Who loves to pratebut hold  I quite forgot  Before I tell you what she  is    I'll tell you what she's  not  No bird of prey with wild uproar  Like CHURCHILL to disturb the grove  Nor comes she like the harmless dove  To bill and coo and love  And nothing more  In short to speak more plainly  Nor be it thought I speak it vainly  Averse to flattery and spite  She is a modest sober dame  I wish all females were the same  And will not scratch or bite  She is not one of those  Who shew their genius in their dress  Whose inky fingers unpinn'd cloaths  The slipshod shoe and snuffy nose  Denote her wit and sluttishness  Who with a Play like pistol cock'd in hand  Bid Managers to stand  " Deliver Sir  " Your thoughts on this  " Before you stir  "  But MadamMiss    " Your answer strait  " I will not wait  "  'Tis fit you know    " I'll hear no reason  " This very season  " AY or NO"  Not to kill more precious time  In dropping sense to pick up rhime  Or like friend SHANDY rattle  And lose my matter in my prattle  Without much wit digression's tame  So I shall give it o'er  And beat about the bush no more  But start my game  The Critick's pen has various uses  It praises now and now abuses  Does this and that  Or both together  As fancy strikes or rhimes come pat  Stabs with the point or tickles with the feather  Authors like bees buz round and round  Dramatic ground  For all they meet  Have sharp and sweet  They do no ill  Would fools sit still  Provoke 'em and they're dangerous things  And ev'ry Player  Should equally beware  Their honey as their stings  GARRICK thou mighty chief of kings and queens  Despotic tyrant of the scenes  Think'st thou all human race to mock  In buskin and in sock  And will not fools  Thy mock'ry ridicules  From CHALKSTONE's Lord to dainty FRIBBLE  Rave chatter write  In various ways display their spite  For all can talk and some can scribble  Others again  Take up the pen  In panegyrick's gaudy colours paint thee  As humour flows  Now friends now foes  In prose and verse and verse and prose  Bedevil thee and saint thee  And can such Criticks teaze thee  And can such praises please thee  O if they can  Alas poor man  No more deride  Thy neighbour's weakness folly pride  But cure thy own  If thou art able  While I make known  My friendship to thee in a Fable  An APE there was an APE of merit  A lively sportive pleasant thing  Had so much fancy whim and spirit  And made such sport  He got to Court  And shew'd his tricks before the LIONKING  Such honour gave him fame  And rais'd his name  From far and near they came to see  This MONKEYprodigy  Though none were more expert and quick  In tumbling backward o'er a stick  Though none with a more lordly pride  And happy ease did e'er bestride  The rugged Russian bear    Though he could skip it up and down  And pick the pocket of a clown  Or whip away his hat  Or fondle with a cat  The wonder of the Fair  This was not allhe had the art  Of acting still a higher part  To each profession that he saw  Physick Divinity or Law  He ludicrously shap'd him  So much possess'd of all their notions  Their humours oddities and motions  That not a soul escap'd him  In ridicule's enchanted glass  Whatever forms are shewn  We all can see another's face  But never find our own  To flatter SELF we all incline  For SELF we plan and labour  " Pluck not good Sir a hair of mine  " And you may scalp my neighbour"  Each laugh'd to see his friend the jest  And prais'd the MONKEY highly  Not openly but slily  At court you find a thousand such  But what was best  Though there were none  By turns he did not fall upon  Each thought himself the only one  The MIMIC could not touch  Blest fools who boast your happy lot  From ridicule secure  Though leopardstain'd you see no spot  INIMITABLY pure  Whether the JACKANAPES was clever  Or the Court not over nice  By various tricks he crept in favour  And for those tricks had DOUBLE PRICE  Thus FORTUNE in a whim  Resolv'd to turn his brain  And fill'd his cup up to the brim  Th'intoxicating cup of joy  Which better heads than his destroy  No wonder he was vain  Whenever gossip FAME prates loud  ENVY in turn as loud will tattle  And scribblers to her standard croud  Cry HAVOCK and prepare for battle  MALEVOLENCE with lynx's eye  The most minute defects will spy  And even FRIENDSHIP shame upon our kind  Is to those faults not always blind  The looking up fatigues the sight  And mortals when they soar  Should they once reach a certain height  All wish to have them lower  And friends there are in this good town  Will lend a hand to help them down  About about my pen  Nor lose the Fable in thy railing  But to our MONKEY back again  Who found that Brutes as well as Men  Have this same cursed failing  The moment he got fame and wealth  How ill exchang'd for ease and health  The envious crew  Poor PUG pursue  Abuse his active pliant spirit  But chiefly those  Were mark'd his foes  Who felt a satire in his merit  The dull and sluggish were the first  To shew their teeth if not to bite  The HOG the BEAR the ASS had burst  Had they not grunted roar'd and bray'd their spite  This furious stir  Awak'd the Critic CUR  HOUND GREYHOUND MASTIFF answer to the call  THE LITTLE DOGS AND ALL  The game's in view  For man and beast  Scandal's a feast  Where both with appetite fall to  The bloated TOAD in silence stole  To gather poison in her hole  As mischief never knows delay  She rouz'd the VIPER in her way  A neighbour and her bosom friend  For though she crawl'd and could not run  She kept this maxim strictly  Ye sons of Law attend  That mischief if it must be done  'Twere well it were done quickly  But then his  friends  Did they oppose  A lukewarm friend's the worst of foes  The GOAT look'd wise and wagg'd his beard  The SPANIEL shook his ears  The Fox turn'd up his pointed nose  Thoughtful and dull the CAT appear'd  Or else in whispers purr'd her fears  The STEED alone was firm and fast  The generous STEED stood by him to the last  PUG sickens mopes and looks like death  Speaks faintly and scarce draws his breath  Some call it Megrim some the Spleen  Words often us'd that little mean  But Scandal with her face demure  Hints it is heat of blood  By which is understood  An old Amour  In short they ransack all diseases  And give him that their fancy pleases  Among the rest  That fits him best  Which best the Doctor serves  Of which he most avails him  When knowledge fails him  And with a face of wisdom calls itNERVES  The HORSE who saw his friend's distress  Did thus his honest mind express  " Come prithee rouze this life's the devil  " What sigh and sob and keep within  " What YOU who us'd to frisk and revel  " For ever chatter and for ever grin  " Zoundsit would make a parson swear  " Get on my back and take the air"  Away they went and as they pass  The HOG the DOG the BEAR the ASS  PUG's diff'rent foes in diff'rent places  If in the least they shew'd their spite  The HORSE would winny snort and bite  And throw  the dirt  into their faces  For all this care  This exercise and air  Yet still the MONKEY pin'd  For well we are assured  That when the grief is in the mind  'Tis sooner got than cur'd  In this condition  What to prescribe hima Physician  There is a certain way of life  Which all must take  For fashion's sake  Or be with all the world at strife  The rich must to the Doctor give  The poor to Nature trust and live  It must be soor could the tribe  Of those who quack or who prescribe  In folly find such ample gain  Could nostrums swell the  Advertiser  Or the wise heads of  Warwicklane  Buy Wig enough to make them wiser  Our patient cannot wait  " Send for a doctor strait"  But not a formal halfbred fool  Who cures by chance and kills by rule  A perriwigpated block  Physicians for the Brutes were Fowls  And though the sworn practitioners were OWLS  They chose a neighbouring COCK  He enters with a stately tread  His comb and wattles dignify his head  No outward fign was ever seen  That promis'd half so much within  And yetye sons of Physick blush  The wine was better than the bush  His learning back'd by penetration  A kind of Radcliffeinspiration  Bound by no partial pedant laws  Shot through each symptom to its cause  A rarity without dispute  He was  an honest  COCK to boot  Yet with this genius worth and knowledge  He had a stain a deep disgrace  No mortal merit could efface  He was not of the College  But holdour hero out of sight  Must now again be brought to light  We left him in the Doctor's care  Who with a serious face  Attending to the case  Did thus his mind declare  " I could like any learned brother  " With a hard name my ign'rance smother  " 'Tis one of our establish'd laws  " Which daily we fulfil  " Whene'er our skill can't find a cause  " To make a cause to suit our skill  " Thus we seldom meet disgrace  " We only can mistake the case  " What are these papers by your side  "  'Tis physick Sir to cure my pride  "  This heap of papers verse and prose  "  Is the joint malice of my foes  "  There's not a day but something's sent me  "  To fret me and torment me  "  This said the conversation stops  For PUG was faint and calls for drops  With rage subdu'd the patient panted  Which struck a light the Doctor wanted  Who thus pronounc'd"I know your ail  " 'Tis not in your heart or head  " As some have said  "  Where then good Doctor  in your  tail  "  His Tail of most uncommon make  In action like the serpent kind  A thousand diff'rent forms could take  Twirl twist and vary to his mind  If Lords were ap'dthis pliant queue  Was cross his breast a ribbon blue  Or green or redand then slapdash  A Chaplain's scarf or Col'nel's sash  When e'er the city struck his brain  'Twas round his neck a Lord Mayor's chain  Or were his part to lisp and trip it  Hey prefto'twas a Lady's tippet  But now depriv'd of spirit life and strength  It lies a languid lank inanimated length  The Doctor paus'dthen silence broke  " I'll strike a master stroke  " This Tail of yours we must amend  " Give it new life and force  " And if we gain that end  " The rest will come of course  " With that same malice of your foes  " Both verse and prose  " Curl it each night and morning  " But then take warning  " Never again to cast your eyes  " On what is wrote or may be writ  " Whether it is or is not wit  " For  there  the magic lies"  'Tis best by craft and not by book  To cure these mental fevers  The MONKEY all for gospel took  The sick are great believers  So well the Doctor's words he noted  His tail that night was  papilloted    His greedy eyes to cure his head  No more on paperdiet fed  The cause remov'd effects will cease  Depriv'd of oil the flame goes out  Our APE began to be at peace  His Tail to move about  The more 'twas curl'd  The more it twirl'd  With head and heart  The Tail took part  Life frisks in ev'ry vein  PUG  was himself again    The MONKEY got his health  The Doctor wealth  Of patients he had plenty  For though the cure was half a joke  'Twas wonder'd at by silly folk  And that's nineteen in twenty  To fix his cure Historians say  That like Sir WILFULL in the play  He talk'd of foreign parts  Left all his griefs and cares behind  Sail'd with the first fair wind  And hey for ITALY and Arts  What he got there no creature knows  Nor he himself can tell us  What lightly comes as lightly goes  With all such pretty fellows  He skip'd the country o'er  And then return'd  With what he learn'd  A greater MONKEY than before  THE Fable told the Moral comes  GARRICK don't fret and bite your thumbs  But take the MONKEY's place  The same's your case  The same prescription we advise  Should Spleen and Spite  Nay though Critic Truth should write  For who is always in the right  Shut your ears and close your eyes  Whate'er is publish'd buy the heap  You'll have it cheap  But not to read or hear it read  Would you strike detraction dead  The Doctor's method cannot fail  Keep the poison from your HEAD  And clap it to your TAIL  The END
