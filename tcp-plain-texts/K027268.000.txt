 ODES ON Several SUBJECTS  ΠΙΝΔΑΡΟΣ  ΧΡΥΣΟΝ ΕΥΧΟΝΤΑΙ ΠΕΔΙΟΝ Δ'ΕΤΕΡΟΙ ΑΠΕΡΑΝΤΟΝ ΕΤΩ Δ'ΑΣΤΟΙΣ ΑΔΩΝ ΚΑΙ ΧΘΟΝΙ ΓΥΙΑ ΚΑΛΥΨΑΙΜ' ΑΙΝΕΩΝ ΑΙΝΗΤΑ ΜΟΜΦΑΝ Δ'ΕΠΙΣΠΕΙΡΩΝ ΑΛΙΤΡΟΙΣ  LONDON  Printed for R DODSLEY at Tully's Head in PallMall And Sold by M COOPER in PaternosterRow  ADVERTISEMENT  THE following ODES were written at very distant intervals and with a view to very different manners of expression and versification The author pretends chiefly to the merit of endeavouring to be correct and of carefully attending to the best models From what the ancients have left of this kind perhaps the ODE may be allow'd the most amiable species of poetry but certainly there is none which in modern languages has been generally attempted with so little success For the perfection of lyric poetry depends beyond that of any other on the beauty of words and the gracefulness of numbers in both which respects the ancients had infinite advantages above us A consideration which will alleviate the author's disappointment if he too should be found to have miscarried  ODE I Allusion to HORACE  Ego apis Matinae  More modoque  c  Lib iv Od ii  AMID the garden's fragrance laid  Where yonder limes behold their shade  Along the glassy stream  With HORACE and his tuneful ease  I'll rest from crouds and care's disease  And summer's piercing beam  Behold the busy wand'ring BEE  From bloom to bloom from tree to tree  She sweeps mellifluous dews  For her the silken gems arise  For her display their shining dyes  Their balmy breath diffuse  Sweet murmurer may no rude storm  This pleasurable scene deform  To check thy gladsome toils  Still may the buds unsullied spring  Still show'rs and sunshine court thy wing  To these ambrosial spoils  Nor shall my Muse hereafter fail  Her fellowlab'rer thus to hail  And lucky be the strains  For long ago did nature frame  Your seasons and your arts the same  Your pleasures and your pains  Like thee in lowly sylvan scenes  And riverbanks and fruitful greens  Delights my vagrant song  Nor strives by soaring high in air  Tho' swans and eagles triumph there  To draw the giddy throng  Nor where the rayen where the owl  By night their hateful orgies howl  Will she her cares imploy  But flies from ruines and from graves  Prom ghostly cells and monkish caves  To daylight and to joy  Nor will she tempt the barren waste  Nor' deigns th' ungrateful stores to taste  Of any noxious thing  But leaves with scorn to others' use  The bitter hemlock's baneful juice  The nettles fordid sting  From all which nature fairest knows  The vernal blooms the surnmer rose  She draws her mingled wealth  And when the lovely task is done  She consecrates a double boon  To pleasure and to health  ODE II On the WINTERSOLSTICE MDCCXL  THE radiant ruler of the year  At length his wintry goal attains  Soon to reverse the long career  And Northward bend his golden reins  Prone on POTOSI's haughty brow  His fiery streams incessant flow  Ripening the silver's ductile stores  While in the cavern's horrid shade  The panting Indian hides his head  And oft th' approach of eve explores  But lo on this deserted coast  How faint the light how thick the air  Lo arm'd with whirlwind hail and frost  Fierce winter desolates the year  The fields resign their chearful bloom  No more the breezes waft persume  No more the warbling waters roll  Desarts of snow fatigue the eye  Black storms involve the louring sky  And gloomy damps oppress the soul  Now thro' the town promiscuous throngs  Urge the warm bowl and ruddy fire  Harmonious dances festive songs  To charm the midnight hours conspire  While mute and shrinking with her fears  Each blast the cottagematron hears  As o'er the hearth she sits alone  At morn her bridegroom went abroad  The night is dark and deep the road  She sighs and wishes him at home  But thou my lyre awake arise  And hail the sun's remotest ray  Now now he climbs the Northern skies  Tomorrow nearer than today  Then louder howl the stormy waste  Be land and ocean worse defac'd  Yet brighter hours are on the wing  And fancy thro' the wintry glooms  All fresh with dews and opening blooms  Already hails th' emerging spring  O fountain of the golden day  Could mortal vows but urge thy speed  How soon before thy vernal ray  Should each unkindly damp recede  How soon each hov'ring tempest fly  That now fermenting loads the sky  Prompt on our heads to burst amain  To rend the forest from the sleep  Or thund'ring o'er the Baltic deep  To whelm the merchant's hopes of gain  But let not man's unequal views  Presume on nature and her laws  'Tis his with grateful joy to use  Th' indulgence of the sov'reign cause  Secure that health and beauty springs  Thro' this majestic frame of things  Beyond what he can reach to know  And that heav'n's allsubduing will  With good the progeny of ill  Attempers every state below  How pleasing wears the wintry night  Spent with the old illustrious dead  While by the taper's trembling light  I seem those awful courts to tread  Where chiefs and legislators ly  Whose triumphs move before my eye  With every laurel freshdisplay'd  While charm'd I taste th' Ionian song  Or bend to PLATO'S godlike tongue  Resounding thro' the olive shade  But if the gay wellnatur'd friend  Bids leave the studious page awhile  Then easier joys the soul unbend  And teach the brow a softer smile  Then while the genial glass is paid  By each to her that fairest maid  Whose radiant eyes his hopes obey  What lucky vows his bosom warm  While absence heightens every charm  And love invokes returning MAY  MAY thou delight of heav'n and earth  When will thy happy morn arise  When the dear place which gave her Birth  Restore LUCINDA to my eyes  There while she walks the wonted grove  The seat of music and of love  Bright as the ONE primaeval fair  Thither ye silver sounding lyres  Thither gay smiles and young desires  Chaste hope and mutual faith repair  And if believing love can read  The wonted softness in her eye  Then shall my fears O charming maid  And every pain of absence die  Then ofter to thy name attun'd  And rising to diviner sound  I'll wake the free HORATIAN song  Old TYNE shall listen to my tale  And ECHO down the bord'ring vale  The liquid melody prolong  ODE III Against SUSPICION  O Fly 'Tis dire SUSPICION'S mien  And meditating plagues unseen  The sorc'ress hither bends  Behold her torch in gall imbrued  Beholdher garments drop with blood  Of lovers and of friends  Fly far Already in your eyes  I see a pale suffusion rise  And soon thro' every vein  Soon will her secret venom spread  And all your heart and all your head  Imbibe the potent stain  Then come the hours of shame and fear  Then hints of horror seize your ear  While gleams of lost delight  Raise the deep discord of the brain  As light'ning shines along the main  Thro' whirlwinds and thro' night  No more can faith or candor move  But each ingenuous deed of love  Which once you would applaud  Now smiing o'er her dark distress  Malignant fancy longs to dress  Like injury and fraud  Farewell to virtue's peaceful times  for soon you'll stoop to act the crimes  You thus can stoop to fear  When vice begins her ugly train  With wrongs of such unmanly stain  What horrors form the rear  'Tis thus to work her baleful pow'r  SUSPICION waits the sullen hour  Of fretfulness and strife  When care th' infirmer bosom wrings  Or EURUS shakes his gloomy wings  To damp the seats of life  But come forsake the scene unblest  Which first beheld your candid breast  To groundless fears a prey  Come where with my prevailing lyre  The skies the streams the groves conspire  To charm your doubts away  Thron'd in the sun's descending car  What Pow'r unseen diffuses far  This tenderness of mind  What Genius smiles on every flood  What GOD in whispers from the wood  Bids every heart be kind  O thou whate'er thy awful name  Whose breath awak'd th' immortal flame  That moves my active veins  Thou who by fair affection's ties  Hast doubled all my future joys  And half disarm'd my pains  Let universal CANDOUR still  Clear as yon heav'nreflefting rill  Preserve my open mind  Nor THIS nor THAT man's crooked views  One mean or cruel doubt infuse  To injure human kind  ODE IV To a GENTLEMAN whose MISTRESS had married an old Man  INDEED my PHAEDRIA if to find  That gold a female's vow can gain  If this had e'er disturb'd your mind  Or cost one serious moment's pain  I should have said that all the rules  You learnt of moralists and schools  Were very useless very vain  Yet I perhaps mistake the case  And tho' with this heroic air  Like one that holds a nobler chace  You seem the lady's loss to bear  Perhaps your heart bely'd your tongue  And thinks my censure mighty wrong  To count it such a flight affair  When HESPER gilds the shaded sky  Slow wand'ring through the wellknown grove  Methinks I see you cast your eye  Back to the morningscenes of love  Her tender look her graceful way  The pretty things you heard her say  Afresh your struggling fancy move  Then tell me is your soul intire  Does wisdom calmly hold her throne  Then can you question each desire  Bid this remain and that begone  No tear halfstarting from your eye  No kindling blush you know not why  No stealing sigh or stifled groan  Away with this unmanly mood  See where the hoary churl appears  Whose hand hath seiz'd the fav'rite good  Which you reserv'd for happier years  While side by side the blushing maid  Shrinks from his visage halfafraid  Spite of the sickly joy she wears  Ye guardian pow'rs of love and fame  This chaste harmonious pair behold  And thus reward the gen'rous flame  Of all who barter vows for gold  O bloom of youth and opening charms  Wellburied in a dotard's arms  O worthy price of beauty sold  Cease then to gaze unthankful boy  Let let her go the venal fair  Unworthy she to give you joy  Then wherefore should she give you care  Lay lay your myrtle garland down  And let the willow's virgincrown  With happier omens bind your hair  O just escap'd the faithless main  Tho' driv'n unwilling on the land  To guide your favour'd steps again  Behold your better genius stand  Where PLATO'S olive courts your eye  Where HAMDEN'S laurel blooms on high  He lists his heav'n directed hand  When these are blended on your brow  The willow will be nam'd no more  Or if that lovedeserted bough  The pitying laughing girls deplore  Yet still shall I most freely swear  Your dress has much a better air  Than all that ever bridegroom wore  ODE V Hymn to CHEARFULNESS  The Author Sick  HOW thick the shades of evening close  How pale the sky with weight of snows  Haste light the tapers urge the fire  And bid the joyless day retire  Alas in vain I try within  To raise the dull dejected scene  While rouz'd by grief these fiery pains  Tear the frail texture of my veins  While winter's voice that storms around  And yon deep deathbell's groaning sound  Renew my mind's oppressive gloom  'Till starting horror shakes the room  Is there in nature no kind pow'r  To sooth affliction's lonely hour  To blunt the edge of dire disease  And teach these wintry shades to please  Come CHEARFULNESS triumphant fair  Shine thro' the painful cloud of care  O sweet of language mild of mein  O virtue's friend and pleasure's queen  Asswage the flames that burn my breast  Attune my jarring thoughts to rest  And while thy gracious gifts I feel  My song shall all thy praise reveal  As once 'twas in ASTRAEA'S reign  The vernal pow'rs renew'd their train  It happen'd that immortal LOVE  Was ranging thro' the spheres above  And downward hither cast his eye  The year's returning pomp to spy  He saw the radiant God of day  Lead round the globe the rosy MAY  The fragrant AIRS and genial HOURS  Were shedding round him dews and flow'rs  Before his wheels AURORA past  And HESPER'S golden lamp was last  But fairest of the blooming throng  When HEALTH majestic mov'd along  All gay with smiles to see below  The joys which from her presence flow  While earth inliven'd hears her voice  And fields and flocks and swains rejoice  Then mighty LOVE her charms confess'd  And soon his vows inclin'd her breast  And known from that auspicious morn  The pleasing CHEARFULNESS was born  Thou CHEARFULNESS by heav'n design'd  To rule the pulse that moves the mind  Whatever fretful passion springs  Whatever chance or nature brings  To strain the tuneful poize within  And disarrange the sweet machine  Thou Goddess with a masterhand  Dost each attemper'd key command  Refine the soft and swell the strong  Till all is concord all is song  Fair guardian of domestic life  Best banisher of homebred strife  Nor sullen lip nor taunting eye  Deform the scene where thou art by  No sick'ning husband damns the hour  That bound his joys to female pow'r  No pining mother weeps the cares  That parents waste on hopeless heirs  Th' officious daughters pleas'd attend  The brother rises to the friend  By thee their board with flow'rs is crown'd  By thee with songs their walks refound  By thee their sprightly mornings shine  And eveninghours in peace decline  Behold the youth whose trembling heart  Beats high with love's unpitied smart  Tho' now he strays by rills and bow'rs  And weeping wears the lonely hours  Or if the nymph her audience deign  Shames the soft story of his pain  With flavish looks discolour'd eyes  And accents falt'ring into sighs  Yet thou auspicious pow'r with ease  Cat'st yield him happier arts to please  Exalt his mein to manlier charms  Instruct his tongue with nobler arms  With more commanding passion move  And teach the dignity of love  Friend to the Muse and all her train  For thee I court the Muse again  And may the votive lay disclose  How much to thy fair aid she owes  See when thy touch reveals her mine  How pure the stores of fancy shine  Hark when thy breath her song impells  How full the tuneful current swells  Let melancholy's plaintive tongue  Instruct the nightly strains of Y    But thine was HOMER'S ancient might  And thine victorious PINDAR'S flight  Thy myrtles crown'd the  ALCAEUS and SAPPHO  Lesbian meads  Thy voice awak'd  THEOCRITUS  Sicilian reeds  Thy breath perfumes the  ANACREON  Teian rose  And Tibur's vine spontaneous flows  While HORACE wantons in thy quire  The gods and heroes of the lyre  See where the pale the sick'ning sage  A prey perhaps to fortune's rage  Perhaps by tender griefs oppress'd  Or glooms congenial to his breast  Retires in desartscenes to dwell  And bids the joyless world farewell  Alone he treads th' autumnal shade  Alone beneath the mountain laid  He sees the nightly damps arise  And gath'ring storms involve the skies  He hears the neighb'ring surges roll  And raging thunders shake the pole  Then struck by every object round  And stunn'd by every horrid sound  He pants to traverse nature's ways  His evils haunt him thro' the maze  He views ten thousand daemons rise  To wield the empire of the skies  And chance and fate assume the rod  And malice blots the throne of GOD  O thou whose pleasing pow'r I sing  Thy lenient influence hither bring  Compose the storm dispel the gloom  Till nature wear her wonted bloom  Till fields and shades their sweets exhale  And music swell each opening gale  Then o'er his breast thy softness pour  And let him learn the timely hour  To trace the world's benignant laws  And judge of that presiding cause  Who founds in discord beauty's reign  Converts to pleasure every pain  Subdues the hostile forms ta rest  And bids the universe be blest  O thou whose pleasing pow'r I sing  If right I touch the votive string  If equal praise I yield thy name  Still govern thou thy poet's flame  Still with the Muse my bosom share  And sooth to peace corroding care  But most exert thy genial pow'r  On friendship's consecrated hour  And while my AGIS leads the road  To fearless wisdom's high abode  Or warm in freedom's sacred cause  Pursues the light of Graecian laws  Attend and grace our gen'rous toils  With all thy garlands all thy smiles  But if by fortune's stubborn sway  From him and friendship torn away  I court the muse's healing spell  For griefs that still with absence dwell  Do thou conduct my fancy's dreams  To such indulgent tender themes  As just the struggling breast may chear  And just suspend the starting tear  Yet leave that charming sense of woe  Which none but friends and lovers know  ODE VI On the Absence of the Poetic Inclination  QUEEN of my songs harmonious maid  Why why hast thou withdrawn thy aid  Why thus forsook my widow'd breast  With dark infeebling damps oppress'd  Where is the bold prophetic heat  With which my bosom wont to beat  Where all the bright mysterious dreams  Of haunted shades and tuneful streams  That woo'd my Genius to divinest themes  Say can the purple charms of wine  Or young DIONE'S form divine  Or flatt'ring scenes of promis'd fame  Relume thy faint thy dying flame  Have soft melodious airs the pow'r  To give one free poetick hour  Or from amid th' Elysian train  The soul of MILTON shall I gain  To win the back with some coelestial strain  O mighty mind O sacred flame  My spirit kindles at his name  Again my lab'ring bosom burns  The Muse th' inspiring Muse returns  Such on the banks of TYNE confest  I hail'd the bright ethereal guest  When first She seal'd me for her own  Made all her blissful treasures known  And bade me swear to follow HER alone  ODE VII To a FRIEND on the hazard of falling in LOVE  NO foolish boyTo virtuous fame  If now thy early hopes be vow'd  If true ambition's nobler flame  Command thy footsteps from the croud  Lean not to Love's inchanting snare  His dances his delights beware  Nor mingle in the band of young and fair  By thought by dangers and by toils  The wreath of just renown is worn  Nor will ambition's awful spoils  The flowry pomp of ease adorn  But Love dissolves the nerve of thought  By Love unmanly fears are taught  And Love's reward with slothful arts is bought  True where the Muses where the pow'rs  Of softer wisdom easier wit  Assist the Graces and the Hours  To render beanty's praise compleat  The fair may then perhaps impart  Each finer sense each winning art  And more than schools adorn the manly heart  If then from Love's deceit secure  Such bliss be all thy heart intends  Go where the whitewing'd eveninghour  On DELIA'S vernal walk descends  Go while the pleasing peaceful scene  Becomes her voice becomes her mien  Sweet as her smiles and as her brow serene  Attend while that harmonious tongue  Each bosom each desire commands  Apollo's lute by Hermes strung  And touch'd by chaste Minerva's hands  Attend I feel a force divine  O DELIA win my thoughts to thine  That half thy graces seem already mine  Yet conscious of the dang'rous charm  Soon would I turn my steps away  Nor oft provoke the lovely harm  Nor once relax my reason's sway  But thou my friendWhat sudden sighs  What means the blush that comes and flies  Why stop why silent why avert thy eyes  So soon again to meet the fair  So pensive all this absent hour  O yet unlucky youth beware  While yet to think is in thy pow'r  In vain with friendship's flatt'ring name  Thy passion masks its inward shame  Friendship the treach'rous fuel of thy flame  Once I remember tir'd of Love  I spurn'd his hard tyrannic chain  Yet won the haughty fair to prove  What sober joys in friendship reign  No more I sigh'd complain'd or swore  The nymph's coy arts appear'd no more  But each could laugh at what we felt before  Wellpleas'd we pass'd the chearful day  To unreserv'd discourse resign'd  And I inchanted to survey  One gen'rous woman's real mind  But soon I wonder'd what possess'd  Each wakeful night my anxious breast  No other friendship e'er had broke my rest  Fool that I wasAnd now ev'n now  While thus I preach the Stoic strain  Unless I shun DIONE'S view  An hour unsays it all again  O friendwhen Love directs her eyes  To pierce where every passion lies  Where is the firm the cautious or the wise  ODE VIII On leaving HOLLAND  ADIEU to LEYDEN'S lonely bound  The BELGIAN muse's sober seat  Where shedding frugal gifts around  On all the fav'rites at her feet  She feeds the body's bulky frame  For passive persevering toils  And left for some ambitious aim  The daring mind should scorn her homely spoils  She breathes maternal foggs to damp its restless flame  Adieu the grave pacific air  Safe from the flitting mountainbreeze  The marshy levels lank and bare  Sacred from furrows hills or trees  Adieu each mantling fragrant flood  Untaughto to murmur or to flow  Adieu the  The Frogs  music of the mud  That sooths at eve the patient lover's woe  And wakes to sprightlier thoughts the painful poet's blood  With looks so frosty and with steps so tame  Ye careful nymphs ye household things adieu  Not once ye taught me love's or friendship's flame  And where is he that ever taught it you  And ye the slowey'd fathers of the land  With whom dominion lurks from hand to hand  Unown'd undignified by public choice  I go where freedom in the streets is known  And tells a monarch on his throne  Tells him he reigns he lives but by her voice  O native ALBION when to thee  Shall I return to part no more  Far from this pale discolour'd sea  That sleeps upon the reedy shore  When shall I plow thy azure tides  And as thy fleecewhite hills aspire  Bless the fair shade that on their sides  Imbow'rs the village and the sacred spire  While the green hedge below the golden slope divides  Ye nymphs that guard the pathless grove  Ye blueey'd sisters of the streams  With whom I wont at morn to rove  With whom at noon I talk'd in dreams  O take me to your haunts again  The rocky spring the greenwood glade  To prompt my slumbers in the murm'ring shade  And sooth my vacant ear with many an airy strain  And thou my faithful harp no longer mourn  Thy drooping master's unpropitious hand  Now brighter skies and fresher gales return  Now fairer maids thy melody demand  Daughters of ALBION guard your votive lyre  O blooming god of Thespia's laurell'd quire  Why sounds not mine harmonious as thy own  When all the virgindeities above  With Venus and with Juno move  In concert round thy list'ming father's throne  Thee too protectress of my lays  Elate with whose majestic call  Above the soft Italian's praise  Above the slavish wreaths of Gaul  I dare from impious thrones reclaim  And wanton sloth's luxurious charms  The honours of a poet's name  To  The Earl of SHAFTSBURY  ASHLEY'S wisdom or to HAMDEN'S arms  Thee freedom I rejoin and bless thy genuine flame  Great citizen of Albion Thee  Heroic Valour still attends  And useful Science pleas'd to see  How Art her studious toil extends  While Truth diffusing from on high  A lustre unconfin'd as day  Fills and commands the public eye  Till pierc'd and sinking by her pow'ful ray  Tame Sloth and monkish Awe like nightly Daemons fly  Hence all the land the Patriot's ardour shares  Hence dread Religion smiles with social joy  Hence the free bosom's softest loveliest cares  Each graceful scene of private life imploy  O fair BRITANNIA hailWith partial love  The tribes of men their native seats approve  Unjust and hostile to a foreign fame  But when from gen'rous minds and manly laws  A nation holds her prime applause  There public zeal defies the test of blame  ODE IX To SLEEP  THOU silent pow'r whose balmy sway  Charms every anxious thought away  In whose divine oblivion drown'd  Fatigue and toiling pain grow mild  Love is with sweet success beguil'd  And sad remorse forgets her secret wound  O whither hast thou flown indulgent God  God of kind shadows and of healing dews  O'er whom dost thou extend thy magic rod  Around what peaceful couch thy opiate airs diffuse  Lo midnight from her starry reign  Looks awful down on earth and main  The tuneful birds lie hush'd in sleep  With all that crop the verdant food  With all that skim the crystal flood  Or haunt the cayerns of the rocky steep  No rushing winds disturb the tufted bowr's  No wakeful sound the moonlight valley knows  Save where the brook its liquid murmur pours  And lulls the waving scene to more profound repose  O let not me thus watch alone  O hear my solitavy moan  Descend propitious on my eyes  Not from the couch that bears a crown  Not from the statesman's thorny down  Or where the miser and his treasure lies  Bring not the shapes that break the murd'rer's rest  Nor those the hireling soldier burns to see  Nor those that haunt the tyrant's gloomy breast  Far be their guilty nights and far their dreams from me  Nor yet those awful joys present  For chiefs and heroes only meant  The figur'd brass the choral song  The rescued people's glad applause  The list'ning senate and the laws  Bent on the dictates of  After Timoleon had deliver'd Syracuse from the tyranny of Dionysius the people on every important deliberation sent for him into the public assembly ask'd his advice and voted according to his decision PLUTARCH  TIMOLEON'S tongue  Are scenes too grand for fortune's private ways  And tho' they shine to youth's ingenuous view  The sober gainful arts of modern days  To such romantic thoughts have bid a long adieu  Blest be my fate I need not pray  That lovesick dreams be kept away  No female charms of fancy born  Nor damask cheek nor spaikling eye  With me the bands of sleep untie  Or steal by minutes half the sauntring morn  Nor yet the courtier's hope the giving smile  A lighter phantom and a baser chain  Bids wealth and place the fever'd night beguile  To gall my waking hours with more vexatious pain  But Morpheus on thy dewy wing  Such fair auspicious visions bring  As sooth'd great MILTON'S injur'd age  When in prophetic dreams he saw  The tribes unborn with pious awe  Imbibe each virtue from his heavenly page  Or such as MEAD'S benignant fancy knows  When health's kind treasures by his art explor'd  Have sav'd the infant from an orphan's woes  Or to the trembling fire his age's hope restor'd  ODE X On LYRIC Poetry  ONCE more I join the Thespian quire  And taste th' inspiring fount again  O parent of the Graecian lyre  Admit me to thy secret strain  And lo with ease my step invades  The pathless vale and opening shades  Till now I spy her verdant seat  And now at large I drink the sound  While these her offspring list'ning round  By turns her melody repeat  I see ANACREON smile and sing  His silver tresses breathe persume  His cheek displays a second spring  Of roses taught by wine to bloom  Away deceitful cares away  And let me listen to his lay  While flow'fy dreams my soul employ  While turtlewing'd the laughing hours  Lead hand in hand the festal pow'rs  Lead youth and love and harmless joy  Broke from the fetters of his native land  Devoting shame and vengeance to her lords  With louder impulse and a threat'ning hand  The  ALCAEUS of Mitylene the capital of Lesbos who fled from his native city to escape the oppression of those who had inslav'd it and wrote against them in his exile those noble invectives which are so much applauded by the ancient Critics  Lesbian patriot smites the sounding chords  Ye wretches ye perfidions train  Ye curst of Gods and freeborn men  Ye murd'rers of the laws  Tho' now you glory in your lust  Tho' now you tread the feeble neck in dust  Yet Time and righteous JOVE will judge your dreadful cause  But lo to SAPPHO'S mournful airs  Descends the radiant Queen of love  She smiles and asks what fonder cares  Her suppliant's plaintive measures move  Why is my faithful maid distrest  Who SAPPHO wounds thy tender breast  Say flies heSoon he shall pursue  Shuns he thy giftsHE too shall give  Slights he thy sorrowsHE shall grieve  And bend him to thy haughtiest vow  But O MELPOMENE for whom  Awakes thy golden shell again  What mortal breath shall e'er presume  To eccho that unbounded strain  Majestic in the frown of years  Behold the  PINDAR  Man of Thebes appears  For some there are whose mighty frame  The hand of JOVE at birth indow'd  With hopes that mock the gazing crowd  As eagles drink the noontide flame  While the dim raven beats his weary wings  And clamours far belowPropitious Muse  While I so late unlock thy hallow'd springs  And breathe whate'er thy ancient airs infuse  To polish Albion's warlike ear  This longlost melody to hear  Thy sweetest arts imploy  As when the winds from shore to shore  Thro' Greece thy lyre's persuasive language bore  Till towns and isles and seas return'd the vocal joy  But oft amid the Graecian throng  The looserob'd forms of wild desire  With lawless notes intun'd thy song  To shameful steps dissolv'd thy quire  O fair O chaste be still with me  From such profaner discord free  While I frequent thy tuneful shade  No frantic shouts of Thracian dames  No Satyrs fierce with savage flames  Thy pleasing accents shall invade  Queen of the lyre in thy retreat  The fairest flow'rs of Pindus glow  The vine aspires to crown thy seat  And myrtles round thy laurel grow  Thy strings attune their varied strain  To every pleasure every pain  Which mortal tribes were born to prove  And strait our passions rise or fall  As at the wind's imperious call  The ocean swells the billows move  When midnight listens o'er the slumb'ring earth  Let me O Muse thy solemn whispers hear  When morning sends her fragrant breezes forth  With airy murmurs touch my opening ear  And ever watchful at thy side  Let Wisdom's awful suffrage guide  The tenour of thy lay  To her of old by JOVE was giv'n  To judge the various deeds of earth and heay'n  'Twas thine by gentle arts to win us to her sway  Oft as from stricter hours resign'd  I quit the maze where science toils  Do thou refresh my yielding mind  With all thy gay delusive spoils  But O indulgent come not nigh  The busy steps the jealous eye  Of gainful care and wealthy age  Whose barren souls thy joys disdain  And hold as foes to reason's reign  Whome'er thy lovely haunts ingage  With me when mirth's consenting band  Around fair friendship's genial board  Invite thy heartawakening hand  With me salute the Teian chord  Or if invok'd at softer hours  O seek with me the happy bow'rs  That hear DIONE 'S gentle tongue  To beauty link'd with virtue's train  To love devoid of jealous pain  There let the Sapphic lute be strung  But when from envy and from death to claim  A hero bleeding for his native land  Or when to nourish freedom's vestal flame  I hear my Genius utter his command  Nor Theban voice nor Lesbian lyre  From thee O Muse do I require  While my prophetic mind  Conscious of pow'rs she never knew  Astonish'd grasps at things beyond her view  Nor by another's fate hath felt her own confin'd  FINIS
