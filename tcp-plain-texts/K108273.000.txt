 THE LAW OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE OR  Christian Submission to Personal Injuries  Wherein is shewn that the several texts of scripture which command the entire submission of  servants  or  slaves  to their  masters  cannot authorize the latter  to exact an involuntary servitude  nor in the least degree justify the claims of modern  Slaveholders  By  GRANVILLE SHARP  SERVANTS  obey in all things  your  masters accord∣ing to the flesh not with eye service as men pleasers but in singleness of heart fearing God  c Coloss iii  THE LAW OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE OR CHRISTIAN SUBMISSION to PERSONAL INJURIES  THE illegality of slavery among Christians is a point which I have long laboured to demonstrate as being destructive of morality and con∣sequently dangerous both to body and soul There are nevertheless some par∣ticular Texts in the New Testament which in the opinion even of several well meaning and disinterested persons seem to afford some proof of the tolera∣tion of slavery among the primitive Christians and from thence they are  induced to conceive  that Christianity doth not oblige its professors to renounce the practice of slaveholding  A learned and reverend correspondent of mine seems to have adopted this no∣tion and has signified his opinion near∣ly to the same effect in a private letter to me on this subject to which I have not yet ventured to send him a reply though it is a considerable time since I received his letter but to say the truth the question in which I had never before apprehended any difficulty was render∣ed very serious and important upon my hands by my friend's declaration and I thought myself bound to give it the strictest examination because I conceiv∣ed as I do still that the honour of the Holy Scriptures which of all other things I have most at heart was con∣cerned in the determination of the point in question and yet I know that my  friend is full as zealous for the honour of the Scriptures as myself and much more learned in them being very emi∣nent in that most essential branch of knowledge  I believe also that he is perfectly dis∣interested and of undoubted  Christian benevolence  The objection has therefore acquired an accumulated weight from the authority and worth of the person who made it and consequently it de∣manded more circumspection and read∣ing to answer it in any reasonable time than my short broken intervals of leisure the only time that I was then master of would permit me to bestow upon it and as so much time has already elapsed the answer which I originally intended for my friend's private perusal shall now be addressed to all well meaning persons in general who may have had the same motives for admitting in any degree the  legality of slavery and that there are many such even among those that are concerned in the practice of slavehold∣ing the example of my disinterested friend's opinion and common charity oblige me to suppose I shall therefore consider my friend's opinion as the com∣mon excuse of our American and West Indian brethren for tolerating slavery a∣among them  I do not think  says he  that Chris∣tianity released slaves from the obligation they were under according to the custom and law of the Countries where it was propagated  This objection to my general doctrine  is  expressed in the most  guarded  terms so  guarded  that it obliges me to ac∣knowledge that the observation is in some respects strictly  true  My pre∣sent attempt is not to confute but  rather to demonstrate wherein this  truth  consists which will afterwards enable me to point out such a due limitation of the doctrine as will ren∣der it entirely consistent with the hypothesis which I have so long labour∣ed to maintain viz  the absolute illega∣lity of slavery among Christians  In conformity to my worthy friend's declaration I must first observe that the disciples of Christ whose  Kingdom  he himself declared  is not of  THIS WORLD  John xviii had no  express  commission to alter  the  TEMPO∣RAL CONDITION OF MEN but only to prepare them for a BETTER WORLD by the general doctrines of  faith hope charity peace and goodwill  or univer∣sal love and benevolence to all man∣kind  submission to injuries dependence up∣on God  c c c which though  general  doctrines are amply and suffi∣ciently  efficacious indeed for the  par∣ticular  reformation of ALL CONDITIONS OF MEN when  sincerity  is not want∣ing in the application of them but the principal intention of the whole sys∣tem is evidently to draw men from the the cares and anxieties of  this present life  to a better hope in the  life to come  which is Christ's proper kingdom Christian servants therefore were of course instructed to be  patient  to be  humble  and  submissive  to their masters  not only to the good and gentle but al∣so  to the  froward  So that even  ill usage  does not justify  perverseness  of be∣haviour in christian slaves  THE apostle  Paul  also frequently in∣sists upon the absolute necessity of an unfeigned obedience in the behaviour of christian servants to their masters  Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called  Art thou  called being a servant care not for it  c Cor vii and again  Ser∣vants be obedient to them that are  your  masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto Christ not with eye service as men pleasers but as the servants of Christ doing the Will of God from the heart with good will doing service as to the Lord and not to men knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive of the Lord whe∣ther he be bond or free  " Ephes vi Again  Servants obey in all things  your  masters according to the flesh not which eye service as men pleasers but in singleness of heart fearing God and whatever you do do it heartily as to the Lord and not unto men  Colos iii The same apostle instructs  Ti∣mothy  to recommend obedience to ser∣vants  'Let as many servants  says the apostle  as are under the yoke count  their own masters worthy of all honour that  THE NAME OF GOD AND HIS DOCTRINE BE NOT BLASPHEMED  And they that have believing masters let them not despise  them BECAUSE THEY ARE BRETHREN BUT RATHER DO them SERVICE BECAUSE THEY ARE FAITHFUL AND BELOVED PAR∣TAKERS OF THE BENEFIT  These things teach and exhort If any man teach otherwise and consent not to whole∣some words  even  the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness he is proud knowing nothing but doting about questions and strifes of words whereof cometh envy strife railings evilfurmisings perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godli∣ness From such withdraw thyself But godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into  this  world  and it is certain we can carry nothing out And having food and raiment let us be therewith content'  Tim vi to And again he insists on the same doctrine 'Exhort  servants  says he  to be obedient unto their own masters  and  to please  them  well in all  things  not answering again not pur∣loining but shewing all good fidelity that they may  ADORN THE DOC∣TRINE OF GOD OUR SAVIOUR IN ALL THINGS  Titus ii  THESE Texts are amply sufficient to prove the truth of my learned friend's assertion so far as it relates to THE DUTY OF THE SLAVES THEMSELVES but this  absolute submission  required of Christian servants by no means implies the  legality  of slaveholding ON THE PART OF THEIR MASTERS which  he  seems to apprehend  THE slave violates no precepts of the gospel by his abject condition pro∣vided that the same is  involuntary  for if he can be made free he is expressly commanded by the apostle to  use it ra∣ther  Art thou called  being  a servant care not for it  BUT IF THOU MAYEST BE MADE FREE USE IT RA∣THER  For he that is called in the lord  being  a servant is the lord's freeman c  ye are bought with a price  BE NOT YE THE SERVANTS OF MEN  Cor vii  but how the master who enfor∣ces  that involuntary servitude  can be said to act consistently with the Christian profession is a question of a very dif∣ferent nature which I propose to ex∣amine with all possible care and impar∣tiality being no otherwise interested in it than as a Christian who esteems both masters and slaves as brethren and con∣sequently while he pities the unhappy  temporal condition  of the latter is ex∣tremely  nxious for the  eternal welfare  of the former  I HAVE already admitted that CHRIS∣TIANITY DOTH NOT RELEASE SLAVES  from the obligation they were under ac∣cording to the custom and law of the countries where it was propagated  agreeable to my learned friend's asser∣tion in favour of which I have pro∣duced a variety of texts but as  the reason of the law  according to a maxim of the  English  law  is the life of the law  we cannot with justice draw any conclusion from thence in fa∣vour of the master's claim till we have examined the principles on which the doctrine  of submission  in these several texts is founded and we shall find up∣on a general view of the whole that the principal reason of enforcing the doctrine was not so much because the persons to whom it was addressed  were slaves  as because they  were Chris∣tians  and were to overcome EVIL  with GOOD to the GLORY OF GOD  and  RELIGION  THESE principles are clearly  expressed  in several of these very texts and  implied  in all of them viz '  That the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed  ' Tim vi and again  that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savi∣our  IN ALL THINGS  Titus ii So that a zeal for the GLORY OF GOD and of HIS RELIGION the principles of the first great commandment is the appa∣rent ground and sole purpose of the Christian  slave's  SUBMISSION which was therefore to be  WITH SINGLE∣NESS OF HEART AS UNTO CHRIST  not with eye service  AS MEN PLEASERS  but as  THE SERVANTS OF CHRIST  doing the will of God from the heart with good will doing service  AS TO THE LORD  and  NOT TO MEN  knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall  HE RECEIVE OF THE  LORD  whether he  BE BOND OR FREE  Ephes vi And again the same apostle charges the servants among the Colossians to obey  not  AS MEN PLEA∣SERS  but in singleness of heart  FEAR∣ING GOD  and whatsoever they do to do it heartil as  TO THE LORD  and  NOT UNTO MEN  Coloss iii  THUS it is plain that the service was to be performed 'as TO THE LORD' and 'NOT TO MEN' and therefore it cannot be construed as an acknowledge∣ment of any  right  or  property  really vested  in the master  This will clearly appear upon a closer examination of some of these texts In the first for instance though the apostle  Peter  enforces the necessity of the ser∣vants  submission  to their masters in the strongest manner commanding them to be subject  not only to the good and gentle but  ALSO TO THE FROWARD  c Pet ii  yet he adds in the very next verse  for this is thank worthy if a man  FOR CONSCIENCE TOWARDS GOD  endure grief  SUFFERING  wrongfully    so that it is manifest the apos∣tle did not mean to  justify  the claim of the masters because he enjoin∣ed the same submission to the ser∣vants that suffered  wrongfully  as to those who had good and gentle masters and it would be highly injurious to the  gospel of peace  to suppose it capable of authorizing  wrongful sufferings  or of establishing a  right  or power in any rank of men whatever to oppress others  unjustly  or  And though the apostle  Paul  also so strongly exhorts servants to sub∣mit to their masters and  to abide in the same calling wherein they were call∣ed  and '  not to care for it  ' Corin∣thians vii Yet at the same time he clearly instructs them that it is their duty to prefer a state of  freedom  whenever they can fairly and honestly  obtain it  but if thou mayest be made free  says he USE IT RATHER  v And the reason which he assigns for this command is as plainly delivered viz  the equality of servants with their masters in the fight of the Almighty  For he that is called in the Lord  being  a SER∣VANT  says he  is the Lord's FREE∣MAN  LIKEWISE  also he that is call∣ed  being FREE  is Christ's  SERVANT  verse  Christ  having purchased all men to be his  peculiar servants  or ra∣ther  freemen  Ye are bought with a price  says the apostle in the d verse BE NOT YE THE SERVANTS OF MEN  which plainly implies that it is incon∣sistent with the dignity of a Christian who is the  servant  or  freeman of  GOD to be held in an  unlimited  subjection as the bond  servant  or  slave of a  MAN and consequently that a toleration of slavery in places where Christianity is established by law is intirely illegal  for tho' THE SLAVE commits no crime by submitting to the  involuntary service  which has been already demonstrated yet the CHRISTIAN MASTER is guilty of a sort of sacriledge by appropria∣ting to himself as an  absolute property  that body which  peculiarly belongs to God by an inestimable purchase  For if God said of the Jews even under the old law Levit xxv  THEY ARE MY SERVANTS  which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt  THEY SHALL NOT BE SOLD AS BONDMEN  My learned friend mentioned in the beginning of this Tract has remarked that  tho' God expressed himself concerning the Jews under the law in this manner  THEY ARE MY SERVANTS WHICH I BROUGHT FORTH OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT THEY SHALL NOT BE SOLD AS BONDMEN  c yet  This did not signify  says he  that they were not to be slaves at all They might be slaves for seven years as is well known notwithstanding they were God's redeemed ser∣vants Nay they might remain slaves 'till the jubilee  WITH THEIR OWN CONSENT  at the expiration of that short term of involuntary servitude These words indeed contained a declaration that none of the Israelites were to be slaves for ever like the Heathen But what a slip∣pery proof  says he  of this exemption with regard to Christians How dangerous  continued he  is it to build doctrines upon such parallels and comparisons  But my worthy friend seems to forget that the kind of sla∣very which I oppose is not that  limited temporary servi∣tude  which he describes  as consistent with the law  for that differs very little from the condition of  hired ser∣vants  in which light the Hebrew masters were  bound by the law  to look upon their brethren even though bought with their money as bond servants or slaves  If thy brother  that dwelleth  by thee be waxen poor  and BE SOLD  unto thee  THOU SHATL NOT COMPEL HIM TO SERVE AS A BOND SERVANT but AS AN HIRED SERVANT AND AS A SOJOURNER  he shall be with thee  and  shall serve thee unto the year of  Jubile  And then shall he depart from thee  both  he and his children with him  c  For they are my servants  said the Almighty THEY SHALL NOT BE SOLD AS BONDMEN THOU SHALT NOT RULE OVER HIM WITH RI∣GOUR  but shalt fear thy God  Levit xxv Here is the very  text  with it's  context  which I had quoted to shew the  illegality  of holding a  brother  Is∣raelite in absolute slavery and as I have elsewere fully demonstrated that men of all nations are to be considered as  brethren  under the gospel dispen∣sation so my learned friend surely does great injustice to the argument when he calls it  a slip∣pery proof  of  this exemption with regard to Chris∣tians  and asserts that the text in question  does not sig∣nify that they  the Israelites  were not to be slaves at all  It clearly  signifies  however that whatsoever  right  a master might have acquired even by an absolute  pur∣chase  over his Hebrew brother yet that he was still required to treat him as an  hired servant  and to dis∣charge  him  and  his  at a  limited time  and when we com∣pare it with the parallel text in Deuterenomy xv we find the master is there strictly enjoined to reward the Bondman LIBERALLY for his past services viz  And when thou sendest him out free from thee  THOU SHALT FURNISH HIM LIBERALLY  out of thy flock and out of thy floor and out of thy wine press  c Surely when the true nature of such  limited servitude  is duly considered it affords but '  a slippery  proof' if I may use my friend's expression  that  they were to be slaves at all  at least '  at all  ' in the sense con∣tended for by our American and West India slave∣holders which is the only matter in dispute at pre∣sent especially as the condition of a  hired servant  is expressly mentioned as the rank in which such Bond∣men were to be esteemed And therefore I trust I may fairly retort the observation of my learned friend '  How dangerous is it to build doctrines  ' that is in favour of absolute slavery  upon such parallels and comparisons  How much  more ought Christians to esteem their  brethren  as  the peculiar servants of  GOD on account of their being  freed  from the more  severe bondage  of our spiritual ene∣my  of which the  Egyptian bondage  was only a type by the inestimable price of Christ's blood and surely we may therefore say  they  are GOD'S SER∣VANTS  whom Christ hath redeemed with his own blood as much as the Jews of old who were on that account expresly  enfranchised  from worldly bond∣age  THEY ARE MY SERVANTS THEY SHALL NOT BE SOLD AS BONDMEN  for this application of the text is entirely to the same effect as the apostle's expression to the Co∣rinthians  Ye are bought with a price  BE NOT YE THE SER∣VANTS OF MEN  Cor vii  Dr  Whithy  indeed supposes that the words '  ye are bought with a price  ' re∣fer only to a pecuniary price given by the primitive Christians  to buy their brethren out of slavery  ' But the autho∣rity of  Justin Martyr  and  Tertullian  which he cites by no means proves his interpretation of the text tho' it may sufficiently prove the primitive practice of  redeeming slaves  which al∣so furnishes a new argument against the legality of  slavery among Christians  so  far as the example of the  primitive Christians  is concerned But scripture is best interpreted by scripture and therefore the most certain means of as∣certaining the true meaning of the words    ye are bought with a price  is to have recourse to the very same expression  the words being only transposed in the preceding chapter th verse where we shall find that it can refer to nothing less than the inestimable price of Christ's redemption  What know ye not  says the apostle  that your  BODY  is the  TEM∣PLE  OF THE HOLY GHOST which is  in you which you have of God and  YOU ARE NOT YOUR OWN FOR YE ARE BOUGHT WITH A PRICE  therefore glo∣rify God  IN YOUR BODY  and in your spirit  WHICH ARE GOD's  Cor vi and consequently it is the duty of a  Christian legislature  to vindicate THE LORD'S FREEMEN  from  SLAVERY as all mankind are included in the same  inestimable purchase  for it is not only their  souls  but even their  bodies which are God's  ' and therefore it is an abomi∣nable  sacriledge  that those  bodies  which are capable of being the  temple of the Holy Ghost  should be esteemed the mere  chattels  and private property of mercenary planters and merchants merely for the sake of a little worldly gain  BUT slaveholders may perhaps al∣ledge that  believing masters  are mention∣ed  as '  faithful and beloved  ' in one of the texts which I have cited and are also expressly accounted as '  partakers of the benefit  ' see Timothy vi so that from thence they may perhaps infer that  slavekeeping  is not inconsis∣tent with their Christian profession  BUT these expressions are included in that part of the apostles charge to  Timothy  which relates merely to the instruction of servants so that there is no room to suppose that any reference was intended to the practice of the mas∣ters by way of  justification  The mean∣ing therefore can amount to no more than this viz that as it is the duty of servants to '  count their own masters  ' even those that are  unbelievers  '  wor'thy of  ALL HONOUR  Apparently meaning '  all honour  ' which is not in∣consistent with their duty to God  THAT THE NAME OF GOD AND HIS DOCTRINE  'BE NOT BLASPHEMED' so the same reason obliges them more especially to count their  believing  masters  worthy  of  all  lawful  honour  because of their  Christian profession  which renders them  accepted of God  For common charity obliges us as Christians to sup∣pose that all men who believe and hold the same profession as ourselves are '  faithful and beloved  ' as well as  par∣takers of the benefit  of Christ's redemp∣tion  Christ's redemption does not seem to be '  the bene∣fit  ' spoken of in the text though I have admitted this implication to avoid controversy Dr  Whitby  sup∣poses that  the benefit of the service  is meant and he con∣strues the sentence accordingly  because they who par∣takes of the  BENEFIT OF THE SERVICE  are faithful and beloved  And Dr  George Benson  also renders it in the same sense viz  because they who partake of  THE BENEFIT OF THEIR SERVICE  are Christians and be∣loved of God  And then he adds in a note  This  says he  I take to have been spoken of  THE MASTERS who  received the  BENEFIT OF THE SERVICE  of their slaves So the author of the Syriae version seems to have understood the words  The MS  called Pet  read  labor and Pet    and Borner read  piety  for which he refers us to  Kuster's  edition of Dr  Mill    And finally  says he  I would observe that  is never used throughout the New Testament for the pri∣vilege of having the gospel or the unspeakable  BENEFIT  of eternal life  because  Belief  is the true means  of leading and disposing men to acquire such happiness and though many other necessary Christian qualities may seem wanting in our  believing brethren  yet we must not presume to condemn them God alone being their  Judge  and for this reason also  Christian ser∣vants  must not condemn and despise their  believing masters  though they know themselves  equalin dignity as brethren  and that it is consequently their masters  duty  to treat them  as brethren  but must render them service the more willingly on this  account  having  brotherly love  as an additional motive to  faithful ser∣vice  It is manifest therefore that this text was intended to regulate the  conduct of  Christian servants  and not that of  Christian masters  for with re∣gard to the former the doctrine is per∣fectly consistent with the other texts that I have quoted which is not the case when it is applied to justify the mere temporal claims of  masters  or  slaveholders  because there are many clear and incontrovertible precepts throughout the New Testament for re∣gulating the conduct of  Christian mas∣ters  which exclude the  justification  of any  such claims  among Christians and consequently forbid any application or interpretation of these particular texts in favour of them and besides we must always remember that it is not lawful to maintain an hypothesis upon the testimony  of any one single text of doubtful interpretation  especially when the same does not clearly correspond with the rest of the scriptures and can∣not bear the test  'of the royal law'  of  which more shall be said in my tract 'on  the Law of Liberty  '  I mention this text of St  Paul  as one of  'doubtful interpretation'  because commentators are divided concerning the application of the very words on which the imaginary justification of the slaveholder is supposed to be founded Many learned men and Dr  Hammond  among the rest have construed the words '  Tim vi  These words are translated by Dr  Hammond  as follows  because they who help to do good are faithful and beloved  and he uses several arguments to shew that these epithets refer  to the servants  rather than  to the masters  in a very different manner from the common version and applied them  to the servants  which entirely destroys the presumption in favour of the slave∣holder  Nevertheless I have contented myself with the common rendering being con∣vinced  that no conclusions can fairly be drawn from this text in favour of Sla∣very even when the epithets  faith∣ful and beloved  c are applied  to the Masters  because the signification of them must necessarily be restrained within the bounds of  gospel doctrine  and therefore we cannot conceive that the apostle intended by the applica∣tion of these epithets to justify any practices which are inconsistent with  the benevolence  enjoined in other parts of the New Testament for this would be liable to produce a contrary effect from that which the apostle expressly intended by his injunction viz that  "the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed"  Thus it appears I hope that the principles on which the doctrine of the  servants submission  is founded are clear∣ly expressed so that  Slaveholders  can have no right to avail themselves of any  of these texts to  enforce an  ABSOLUTE SUBMISSION for though these several texts clearly justify  the Slave  yet they cannot justify the Master unless he can shew that the same  principles or reason of the Law  on which they are founded hold good also on  his  side of the ques∣tion  This is apparently the case in the other  dif∣ferent relations of life mentioned in these contexts  as in  the relation  between  husbands  and  their wives parents  and  their children  but is far otherwise in the  relation  be∣tween  masters and their servants  unless free  hired ser∣vants  are to be understood and therefore the objecti∣on of my learned friend drawn from thence cannot be just He says  If the connexion of persons in the two former respects be lawful so that husbands had a right to the subjection of their wives and wives a right to the love of their husbands parents had a right to the honour and obedience of their children and chil∣dren a right to maintenance and instruction by their pa∣rents unnatural  says he  is it to imagine the connection between Masters and Slaves was looked upon by him as absolutely unlawful so that the former had no right to rule the latter Indeed he very clearly signifies  says he  that the right of dominion remained when be opposes  DOING WRONG TO OBEYING IN ALL THINGS THEIR MASTERS ACCORDING TO THE FLESH c  as he does Coloss  iii    But my learned friend has entirely misunderstood the purport and intention of my arguments on these several texts relating to  obedience  and  submission  I have not attempted to prove  by these particular expressions of the apostle  that  the connexion between Masters and Slaves was looked upon by him as absolutely unlawful  so that the former had  no right to rule the latter  for this I have demonstrated I trust by OTHER AUTHORI∣TIES  of Scripture  equally authentic and much less liable to be misunderstood My attempt to explain the texts in question extends no farther than to shew that they do not really  justify the uncharitable claims of the modern Slaveholders  though they are frequently cited for that purpose  An attempt to shew  that any particular doctrine is  NOT NECESSARILY IMPLIED  in a certain text or texts of Scrip∣ture  is a very different thing from an attempt to PROVE or AUTHENTICATE AN OPPOSITE DOCTRINE  by the same text of Scripture  For instance when my learned friend asserts as above that the apostle to the Colos∣sians iii  very clearly signifies that the right of do∣minion remained when he opposes  DOING WRONG to OBEYING  in all things their Masters  c I do not pretend to build an  opposite doctrine upon the very same words  but shall only endeavour to shew that this sup∣posed  "right of dominion"  is not necessarily  implied  in the text which my friend has cited in support of it  The servants are indeed expressly and plainly ex∣horted to  obedience  and  submission  as well in this as in all the other texts before recited so that a contrary behaviour in them might certainly be esteemed a  do∣ing wrong  on their part yet this by no means implies  "a right of dominion"  vested in the Master for that would prove too much because the like sub∣mission is elsewhere equally enjoined to those who are expressly said to  endure grief  SUFFERING WRONG∣FULLY    and we cannot suppose as I have before observed that the  submission enjoined  implies a  right  in the Master to exercise such a  dominion  as that of  oppressing others  UNJUSTLY or  for that could not possibly tend to promote the declared purposes of the apostle's exhortations viz  "that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed"  Tim vi and again  that they may adorn the doctrine of God in all  THINGS  Titus ii These purposes how∣ever are fully answered in the advice given by the same apostle to all the other  different relations of life  men∣tioned by my worthy friend WIVES may  adorn the doctrine of God  by SUBMISSION to their  own husbands as it is fit in the Lord  See Coloss iii And HUSBANDS by  love  to their  wives  for they are expressly charged in the following verse  not to be bitter against them  that is they must by  love  and  sincere affection  moderate and soften that supreme authority with which  husbands  are entrusted by the laws of God and man that they may  rule  rather by the gentle influence of an inviolable  love  and  fidelity  as so good an example will seldom fail to produce  due respect  and will certainly  "adorn the doctrine"  or profession of the Christian CHILDREN  may adorn the doctrine of God  by OBEDIENCE  to their  parents in all things for this is wellpleasing  says the text  unto the Lord  v And again the reciprocal duty of FATHERS is plainly pointed out to be a prudent modera∣tion of that  paternal  authority with which they are en∣trusted for they are carefully warned against an arbi∣trary severity  Provoke not  says the apostle  your children to anger lest they be discouraged  SERVANTS are in the very next verse v commanded to  obey in all things their Masters according to the flesh not with eyeservice as  MENPLEASERS  but in singleness of heart  FEARING GOD  so that the SUBMISSION of the servants was also to  adorn the "doctrine of God"  it being manifestly enjoined only for  God's sake  and not on account of any supposed "RIGHT OF DOMINION" invested in the  Masters  which the following verses v and when  applied to  THE SERVANTS sufficiently demonstrate  And  whatsoever ye do do it heartily as to the Lord and  NOT UNTO MEN  knowing that of  THE LORD  ye shall receive  THE REWARD OF THE INHE∣RITANCE  for  YE SERVE THE LORD CHRIST  And to the same eternal and unerring Dispenser of  Re∣wards  and not to  temporal Masters  is attributed the power of punishing the  "doing wrong"  mentioned in the very next verse which according to my learned friend's notion is  opposed  to  obeying in all things the Masters    he that  DOETH WRONG says the text  shall receive for  THE WRONG  which he hath done and  THERE IS NO RESPECT OF PERSONS  v  Such strict  impartiality  in the administration of justice cannot always be attributed with certainty even to the bestregulated  human  tribunal and much less is it applicable to the decisions of uncontrouled  will  and  pleasure  in punishing  "wrong doing"  under the ab∣solute  dominion  of Slaveholders No earthly  dominion  whatever is conducted with such an equal distribution of  rewards  and  punishments  as that it may always with truth be said  "there is no respect of persons"  for this is the proper characteristic of the  judgements and do∣minion  of GOD and CHRIST alone  For  THE LORD  is  JUDGE  and with him is  NO RESPECT OF PERSONS  Ecclesiasticus xxxv "  For there is  NO RESPECT OF PERSONS  with  GOD" Rom ii And there∣fore we may fairly conclude that the punishment not only of SLAVES but that also of MASTERS that  "do wrong"  is to be understood in the text which my friend has cited to support his notion of a  right of dominion  vested in the  Masters  so that the said supposed  right  has indeed but a very  "slippery"  foundation Agreeable to my last remark on this text Coloss iii the learned Dr Whitby has com∣mented upon it as if he thought it exactly parallel to another declaration of the same apostle viz Ephes vi and wherein not only both  Masters  and  Ser∣vants  are unquestionably included but also the  domi∣nion  or  judgement  in  which  THERE IS NO RESPECT OF PERSONS  is expressly attributed to our  MAS∣TER IN HEAVEN    Christ in judging men at the last day  says the Doctor  will have  NO RESPECT  to the quality or external condition of any man's person but  WHETHER HE BE BOND OR FREE  he shall receive recompence  FOR THE GOOD THAT HE HATH DONE  in obedience to him whether he be  MASTER  or  SERVANT  he shall be punished for  THE WRONG THAT HE DOTH  in those relations  If all these circumstances be duly considered it will manifestly appear I trust that the Masters sup∣posed  "right of dominion"  which certainly is  not  EXPRESSED in the text cannot even be  implied  in these contexts nor in any of the parallel passages al∣ready recited Can the Master  adorn the  doctrine of God our Saviour  as in the other indissoluble re∣lations of life by continuing the unnatural  connection  of  Master  and  Slave  and by  exacting  involuntary labour from his  brethren without wages  or  reward  agreeable to my friend's notions of the supposed implied  right of dominion  The reciprocal duty of the Master is mentioned indeed in the next chapter Col iv but it is of such a nature as must necessarily lead Chris∣tian Masters to abhor any such supposed  right of dominion  as that which is tolerated in the British colonies and which my friend seems desirous to defend The  Masters  are not directed by the apostle to claim as their own by  "right of dominion"  the  labour  of their servants WITHOUT WAGES but on the contrary are expressly commanded to  GIVE  unto  their  ser∣vants that which is  JUST  and  EQUAL  which com∣prehends as I have fully shewn in the preceding tract such a measure of  generosity recompence  and  benevolence  on the part of  the Master  as is totally inconsistent with the claims and views of modern  Slaveholders  and if put in practice would necessarily effect the entire abolition of slavery  The Masters are likewise carefully reminded in the last mentioned text that they  also have a Master in Heaven  Col iv A  Master  by whose example they are bound to regulate their conduct so that this consideration alone is a sufficient antidote a∣gainst  slavery  for the principal doctrine of  that heaven∣ly Master  was LOVE which cannot subsist with the contrary  exaction of involuntary servitude  This is my commandment  said that glorious and gracious MASTER "  That ye  LOVE  one another  AS  I have  LOVED  you  " The nature of  his love  which we are to imitate that is to LOVE  as he hath  LOVED  us  is then immediately described as exceeding all bounds of comparison "  Greater  LOVE" said he  hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his  FRIENDS  Ye are my  FRIENDS  if ye do whatsoever I command you  HENCEFORTH I CALL YOU NOT SERVANTS  Here is an express  enfranchisement  of  his Servants  for our example The universal  Lord  and  Master  of all men delights in promoting  the dignity of human nature  which cannot be said of the temporal  Slaveholder  who enforces an imaginary  "right of do∣minion"  by exacting an  involuntary service  and that for no other purpose than for the sake of a little pe∣cuniary gain by depriving the  labourer of his hire  which savours of no other  love  but  selflove  whereas our disinterested Lord and Master hath even  laid down his life  through  love  and  compassion  to his SERVANTS and hath  declared us free  as before recited  Hence∣forth I call you not  SERVANTS  for the Servant  said he  knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you  FRIENDS  for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you  John xv And in the th verse he again enforces his doctrine of LOVE "  These things I command you  said he  that ye  LOVE  one another  " The measure of this indispensible LOVE is expressly declared in the Scrip∣tures  Thou shalt  LOVE  thy neighbour  AS THYSELF LOVE  worketh no ill to his neighbour therefore  LOVE is  the fulfilling of the law  Rom xiii and  Such LOVE therefore is clearly incompatible with the arbitrary claims of the Slaveholder who can nei∣ther be  said  to LOVE  his neighbour as himself  nor to cherish that LOVE  which worketh no ill to his neighbour  whilst he strenuously contends for such  a right of dominion  as may enable him to exact not only the  involuntary  service of his  neighbours  and  brethren  con∣trary to the law of nature but also to rob them of the  fruits of their own labours  GIVING THEM NOT FOR THEIR WORK  against which practices a severe denunciation of WOE is expressly declared in the Scriptures as I have fully demonstrated in my tract on  "the Law of Retribution"  as well as in the prece∣ding tract and therefore as it is necessary to con∣strue difficult or dubious passages of  Scripture  consist∣tently with the general tenour of  Scripture  evidence it would be highly improper to admit this  opposite doc∣trine  of a supposed "RIGHT OF DOMINION" espe∣cially as the same  is not expressed  in the text which my learned friend has cited for it but is merely drawn forth by an imaginary  implication  Can the Slaveholders and  African traders alledge for instance that they shall  adorn the doctrine of  God our Saviour  Titus ii by persisting in their unnatural pretensions  to an absolute  property  in their poor  bre∣thren  or that they  do the will of  God from the heart  Ephesians vi c when they retain their  neigh∣bour  in an involuntary unrewarded ser∣vitude for life If they can do this I  shall have reason to be silent But if on the contrary it should evidently ap∣pear  that a  very different behaviour  is required of  Christian Masters  that  the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed  Tim vi they must be obliged to allow that the  "rea∣son or life of the law"  is against them and consequently that none of these texts relating to Christian servants are capable of affording them the least ex∣cuse for their selfish pretensions They will find also upon a more careful ex∣amination of the Scriptures that they themselves are as much bound by the gos∣pel to bear personal injuries with patience and humility as their Slaves Because the benevolent principles of the  gospel of peace  require all men  freemen as well as slaves  to return  "good for evil"  "  Bless them that  CURSE  you  " said our  Lord  and  PRAY  for them which  DESPITEFULLY USE YOU  And unto  him that  SMITETH  thee on the one cheek offer also the other and him that  TAKETH AWAY  thy cloke forbid not  to take thy  coat also  c Luke vi But though  submis∣sion  and  placability  are thus unquesti∣onably enjoined to the  sufferers  in all the cases above recited in the text yet surely no reasonable man will pretend to alledge from thence that  tyrants  and  oppressors  have thereby obtained a legal  right  under the gospel to  curse others  and use them  despitefully  or that the unjust oppression of  strikers and robbers  is thereby authorized or justified In the  same light exactly  must we view the  Slave∣holders  claim of  private property in the persons of men  whenever an attempt is made to support it on the foundation of any such texts as I have quoted wherein servants or slaves are exhorted to submit  with passive obedience  c to their Mas∣ters because the  right  as it is impro∣perly called or pretension of the Mas∣ter may with the greatest propriety be compared to the pretended  right  or au∣thority of oppressing or robbing others which is too often exercised by imperial tyrants and despotic princes as well as by  their brethren in iniquity  of a lower class viz pirates highwaymen and extortioners of every degree The gospel of peace cannot authorize the oppression of these lawless men though it clearly enjoins patience submission and acqui∣escence to the individuals that are en∣jured whether freemen or slaves The  placability  and  absolute submission  com∣manded by the lastcited text to Chris∣tians  in general  are manifestly founded on the very same principles with that  particular  submission which the gospel requires of  Christian slaves  and is far∣ther parallel to the latter by being  e∣qually  passive  so that the  oppression  of the  Slaveholder  can no more be justified by any text of the New Testament that I am able to find than the  oppression  of the  striker  and  robber  Unhappily for the Christian world the duties of  patience submission  and  placability  enjoined by the gospel to  per∣sons injured  are too commonly either misunderstood or rejected though the  temporal  as well as the  eternal  happiness of mankind greatly depends upon a con∣scientious and proper observation of these duties for even the most rigid obedi∣ence to the letter of the command would be far from being productive either of the  real evils  to which the pernicious doctrine of  a national passive obedience  apparent∣ly tends or of the  imaginary inconve∣niences  apprehended by the advocates for  duelling  because the same benevo∣lent principles viz universal love and  charity founded on the great command∣ment  Thou shalt love thy neigh∣bour as thyself  which oblige the true Christian most  disinterestedly  to forgive all injuries and pass over every affront offered to his  own person  will necessarily engage him on the other hand as  disinterestedly  to oppose every degree of oppression and injustice which affects his  brethren and neighbours  when he has a fair opportunity of assisting them and from hence arises the zeal of good men for  just  and  equitable laws  as being the most effectual means of preserving the  peace  and  happiness  of the community by curbing the insolence and violence of wicked men We have an eminent example of this  loyal zeal  in the behaviour of the apostle Paul who could not brook an infringement of  the Roman liberty  from any persons whatever in the administration of government though he could endure  personal injuries  from men unconnected therewith and the persecutions of the multitude with all the  Christian patience  and  meekness  which the gospel requires The Scrip∣turehistory of this great apostle affords many proofs of his extraordinary hu∣mility and patience  under sufferings  so that his spirited opposition to the illegal proceedings of magistrates cannot be at∣tributed to  private resentment  on his own account but merely to his zeal for  the public good  founded upon the great Christian principle of  loving his neigh∣bour as himself  since the maintaining of  good laws  is certainly the most ef∣fectual means of promoting the welfare and happiness of society His resolute and free censure of the magistrates at Philippi in the message which he sent by their own serjeants    And when it was day the magistrates sent the serjeants saying Let those men go And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul The ma∣gistrates have sent to let you go now therefore de∣part and go in peace But Paul said unto them  They have beaten us openly uncondemned being Romans and have cast  us  into prison and now do they thrust us out privily nay verily but let them come themselves and fetch us out  And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates and they feared when they heard that they were Romans And they came and besought them and brought  them  out and desired  them  to depart out of the city  Acts xvi to  his spirited  remonstrance to the chief captain at Jerusalem    The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle and bade that he should be examined by scourging that he might know where∣fore they cried so against him And as they bound him with thongs Paul said unto the centurion that stood by  Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman and uncondemned  When the centurion heard  that  he went and told the chief captain saying Take heed what thou doest for this man is a Roman Then the chief captain came and said unto him Tell me art thou a Roman he said Yea And the chief captain answered With a great sum obtained I this freedom and Paul said But I was free born Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him  and the chief captain was also afraid after he knew that he was a Roman and because he had bound him  On the morrow because he would have known the cer∣tainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews he loosed him from  his  bands and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear and brought Paul down and set him before them  Acts xxii to  and his severe rebuke  to the high priest himself even on the seat of judgement    And Paul earnestly beholding the council said Men and brethren I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth Then Paul said unto him  God shall smite thee  thou WHITE  WALL  for sittest thou to judge me after the law and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law  And they that stood by said Revilest thou God's high priest Then said Paul I wist not brethren that he was the high priest for it is written Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people  Acts xxiii to  are remarkable instances of this observation  In the lastmentioned instance in∣deed the apostle was charged by those  "that stood by"  with  reviling God's  high priest  which would have been a notorious breach of the law had there not been circumstances of justification sufficient to vindicate the severity of the Apostle's censure these however were not urged by the apostle himself who best knew how to behave towards those with whom he had to do He readily allowed the principle however on which the censure of his accusers was founded but he by no means retracted what he had so justly applied to the person of the unworthy magistrate  who sat to judge him  neither did he even  acknowledge  him to be the  high priest  though he was expressly questioned for a supposed misbehaviour to that digni∣tary His answer was cautiously word∣ed He did not say  I knew not that this person whom I have censured was the high priest  but    c  I knew not brethren that there is a high  priest  The learned Hugh Broughton has construed the text as follows  I knewe not brethren that there was a high priest  but the words  are more literally rendered above CASTALIO reads it  Nesciebam fratres esse ponti∣ficem  And HEINSIUS  Summum esse sacerdotem ignorabam  Which answer though on the first hearsay it seems to bear some affinity to an excuse or apology for what had past yet in reality includes a still farther rebuke for it plainly im∣plies that the  high priest  in whose pre∣sence the apostle then stood was in some respect or other deficient or blame∣able in his deportment as chief magi∣strate either that he did not duly sup∣port the dignity of that sacred and distinguishing public character so that he did not seem to be  high priest  and of course could not be known and hon∣oured as such or else that his behaviour had been so unjust and illegal that he did not deserve to be considered as a  lawful magistrate  who had publicly demeaned  himself as  a tyrant  by commanding a prisoner to be beaten  contrary to law  without hearing his defence And that this latter sense is most probable we may learn by the following circum∣stance viz that the apostle chose to de∣cline the dispute and to wave the accu∣sation about  reviling the high priest  by  acknowledging  the principle of law on which it was manifestly founded viz  Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people  But be pleased to observe he neither  acknowledged  that he him∣self had broken the said precept by so severely censuring the unjust  ruler  nor did he  acknowledge  the presence of  a high priest  in the person of Ananias neither did he allow the bystanders time enough to criticise upon the true literal meaning of his reply whereby they would probably have been led to demand some express recantation of the  personal  censure which he had so amply  bestowed upon the high priest but he prudently changed the subject in debate from  the  PERSON  of the high priest  who was a zealous overbearing SADDUCEE    c But the younger ANANUS who as we have said obtained the ponti∣ficate was of a bold and daring disposition and followed the sect of the SADDUCEES who with respect to judge∣ments are more cruel than all the rest of the Jews as we have already demonstrated Therefore Ananias being of this stamp c  to an avowed  censure of his whole sect  charging the SADDUCEES in particular with the unjust persecution then before the assembly and openly appealing to the opposite party  the Pharisees  in order to divide his united enemies  I am a  PHARISEE said he  the son of a  PHARISEE  of the hope and re∣surrection of the dead I  AM CALLED IN QUESTION  Such a manifest reflection against the whole body of  Sadducees  cannot by any means favour the supposition of an intended apology or recantation in the preceding sentence to soothe the enraged leader of that very party whom he had publicly branded as a hypocrite with the significant ap∣pellation of  whited wall  Let it be also remembered that the supposed breach of the precept  thou shalt not speak evil of the  RULER  of thy people  could not rest entirely on the circumstance of KNOW∣ING ANANIAS TO BE THE HIGH PRIEST for whether the apostle  did know  or  did not know  that Ananias was  high priest  yet he certainly  knew  before he censured him that he was  a ruler of the people  and that he then sat in  the quality of a judge  for this is declared in the very censure itself  sittest thou to  JUDGE ME  after the law and commandest me to be smit∣ten  CONTRARY TO LAW  so that whether  Ananias  was really  high priest  or not yet he was manifestly censured in his official capacity as a  ruler  or  ma∣gistrate  and not as a private individual through any inadvertency or mistake of the apostle as some commentators have conceived And even when the a∣postle was informed by those  that stood by  that the magistrate whom he had censured was the  high priest "revilest thou God's high priest"  Yet his reply  I knew not brethren that there is a high priest  when fairly compared with the preceding censure of Ananias as an  unjust  dispenser of God's law  sittest thou to judge me according to law  c proves as I before re∣marked that the apostle neither ac∣knowledged the dignity of  a high priest  nor that of a  legal ruler in the person of Ananias  though he knew him at the same time TO BE A RULER and had censured him as such for having noto∣riously prostituted the power and autho∣rity  of a  ruler  and violated the law by commanding him to be  stricken contra∣ry to law  notwithstanding that  he sat to judge  as the apostle remarked  AC∣CORDING  to the law  in which case no epithet whatever could be so apt and expressive to mark the true character of the dignified hypocrite in power as  whi∣ted wall  This proves that the apostle knew well enough with whom he had to do The censure was too just and his prophecy in the accomplishment too true  "God shall smite thee"  thou  whited wall    This denunciation of God's vengeance against Ananias was fully justified by the event for Josephus as the learned monsieur Martin remarks reports that he was killed in Jerusalem with his brother Ezechias "Josephe rapporte" liv de la guerre des Juifs  qu'il fut massacré dans Jérusalem avec son frère Ezéchias  to be esteemed a mere un∣guarded sally of resentment The latter supposition is indeed inconsistent with the remarkable  sagacity prudence  and  readiness  of  mind  which always distin∣guished  this apostle in bearing his testi∣mony to the truth on the most danger∣ous emergences The apostle's known character as  a chosen vessel  for Christ's service and as an exemplary preacher of RIGHTEOUSNESS will by no means permit us to conceive that he was either guilty of any  mistake  or  inadvertency  with respect to  the person  of the high priest on this occasion or of any  illegal  or misbecoming behaviour to him as a  ruler  or  judge  of the people When these several circumstances are compared with the general bad character of Ananias  This malicious Sadducee very soon afterwards gave so flagrant a proof of his injustice and cruelty towards the Christians that even the  Jewish historian  Josephus has recorded it as an event which gave offence to all good and loyal men at that time in Jerusalem I mean the murder of the apostle James bishop of Jeru∣salem whom Josephus stiles  the brother of Jesus who was called Christ  The Jewish historian therein bears a remarkable testimony in favour of Christianity  for he is described in the pre∣ceding quotation from Josephus as a bold daring man of the most cruel sect  Which is translated by Mr Whis∣ton as follows  When therefore Ananus was of this disposition he thought he had now a proper oppor∣tunity  to exercise his authority FESTUS  was dead and  ALBINUS  was but upon the road So he assembled the sanhedrim of judges and brought before them  THE BROTHER OF JESUS WHO WAS CALLED CHRIST  whose name was  JAMES  and some others  or some of his companions  and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law he de∣livered them to be sioned The  MOST EQUITABLE OF THE CITIZENS AND SUCH AS WERE THE MOST UNEASY AT THE BREACH OF THE LAWS DIS∣LIKED WHAT WAS DONE  They also sent to the king  Agrippa  desiring him to send to  ANANUS  that he should act so no more for that what he had already done was not to be justified  as a persecuting zealot of the most virulent and intolerant sect among the Jews it must appear that the apostle accounted that person unworthy of any esteem as a magistrate whom he had so publicly con∣victed  of abusing and perverting the legal authority with which he had been en∣trusted and indeed a notorious breach of the law by any man in the capacity of  a ruler  may reasonably be esteemed a temporary disqualification for such an honourable trust for a  judge  without  justice  and  righteousness  who openly per∣verts judgement does thereby unques∣tionably degrade himself from the dig∣nity of his station and render himself unworthy for the time being of that respect which is otherwise due to his rank in office The same apostle in∣deed upon another occasion commands us to give  "honour to whom honour" is due  but what  honour  can be due to a convicted hypocrite a  whited wall  a  wolf in sheep's cloath∣ing  to an  Ananias on the seat of judgement  SUCH characters must expect SUCH treatment as  Ananias  met with from all sensible and discerning  men if the latter are also equally  loyal  with the apostle I mean in the strict and proper sense of the word  loyal  which is so frequently misapplied and perverted by sycophants that is if they are equally zealous with that a∣postle for  law justice  and  righteousness  for the general good of mankind So that if we approve of the apostle's ad∣vice in the beginning of the same sen∣tence viz  RENDER THEREFORE UNTO ALL THEIR DUES    tri∣bute unto whom tribute    custom to whom custom    FEAR  to whom FEAR    HONOUR  to whom  HO∣NOUR  we must needs also allow that the apostle's  practice  even in his behaviour to  Ananias  was strictly con∣sistent with his own declared  precepts  and that he most justly  rendered  to  A∣nanias  HIS DUE when he so severely reprimanded his conduct  as a judge  When all these circumstances are duly  considered the meaning of the apostle's reply may fairly enough be para∣phrased in the words of LORINUS    Nesciebam eum esse  PONTIFICEM  quia ex modo loquendi furioso non videtur esse  PONTIFEX sed TYRANNUS  Many of the most learned and cele∣brated commentators have considered the apostle's censure nearly in the same light In the learned com∣mentary commonly called Assembly's Annotations the same sense is applied to the apostle's reply to the charge of having  reviled God's high priest  viz  I knew him not to be a lawful high priest  WHO THUS VIO∣LATETH THE LAW and indeed  says the Com∣mentary "  he was but an usurper  For proof of which they refer us to  Josephus Ant l c Chr Helvic Theat Hist Anno Christi  The learned MATHIAS FLACIUS FRANCOWITZ remarks that the famous  Augustine  bishop of Hippo thought this reply of the apostle IRONICAL  IRONIAM esse putat Augustinus Est sane quiddam vicinum ironiae Cum enim videret cum sedere inter sacerdotes loco praeci∣puo et secundum legem judicare necessariò scivit eum esse pontificem tametsi et aloqui etiam minimi pueri necessariò id illic vel ex sola ejus pompa et asseclis vulgoque jactatis vocibus sciverunt nedum Paulus homo tam vigilans et diligens Sensus ergo est Ego  non agnosco in hoc homine pontificem Dei  sed hypocritam seduilorem et veritatis persecutorem  Alioqui bene scio principi maledicendum non esse  and truly  says he  it borders upon  IRONY  for when he saw him  Ananias  sit in the chief place among the priests to judge according to the law he necessarily knew him to be the high priest for even the little children knew that by his mere pomp and attendants and much less could a man so watchful and diligent as Paul be ignorant of it the sense therefore is  says the learned Francowitz  I do not acknowledge in this man the high priest of God  but a hypocrite a de∣ceiver and a persecutor of the truth Otherwise I well know that  a ruler  is not to be spoken against or reviled  To the same effect also the learned monsieur Martin  "as St Paul"  says he  Comme St Paul n'ignoreit pas et ne pouvoit pas même ignorer que ce ne fût le souverain sacrificateur puis qu'il le voyoit à la tête du sanhédrin il vaut miéux traduire le term de l'original par  je ne pensois pas  comme Marc ix et prendre ainsi cette répartie de St Paul comme une grave et forte ironie par laquelle il vouloit fair sentir à ceux qui l'avoient repris de manquer de respect pour le souverain sacrificateur que c'étoit un homme indigne de ce caractère et qu'il ne croyoit pas qu'un vicieux et un impie comme étoit Anani  qui avoit usurpé le pontifient en l'achetant des Romains méritat d'être regardé comme  le souverain sacrificateur de Dieu    was not ignorant nor could be ignorant that this was the high priest especially as he saw him at the head of the sanhedrim it is better to translate the term of the original by I  DID NOT THINK  c as in Mark  ix  and so to understand this reply of St Paul as a grave and strong irony by which he would make those understand by whom he was accused of the want of respect for the high priest that this person was a man unworthy of that character and that he did not be∣lieve that a vicious and wicked man such as Ananias who had usurped the pontificate by purchasing it of the Romans could deserve to be esteemed as the high priest of God  It would be tedious to quote all the authorities that may be found to this purpose the evidence however of the learned Dr Whitby as it includes more au∣thorities than his own is worthy the readers notice  Dr LIGHTFOOT  and  GROTIUS says he  think as I do that St Paul does  NOT  go about  TO EXCUSE HIS MISTAKE  but rather saith I  KNOW WELL ENOUGH THAT GOD'S HIGH PRIEST IS NOT TO BE REVILED  but that this  ANANIAS  is a  HIGH PRIEST  I know not i e I  DO NOT OWN HIM AS SUCH  who hath procured this title by bribery our celebrated  RABBINS  having declared that such an one  IS NEITHER A JUDGE  nor  TO BE HONOURED AS SUCH  c  as I find him quoted by CORNELIUS A LAPIDE viz  I knew not that he  was the high priest  because from his furious manner of speaking he did not seem to be a HIGH PRIEST but a TYRANT  This sense is strictly consonant to  reason  and  natural right  Justice  and  righteousness  are so in∣separably connected with the proper character of a CHIEF MAGISTRATE or RULER that any notorious perversion of those necessary principles in the ac∣tual exercise of that official power with  which a magistrate is entrusted for  legal  and not for illegal purposes must un∣avoidably distinguish the  contemptible hypocrite  THE WHITED WALL from the honourable MAGISTRATE and de∣prive the former of the respect which is due only to the latter  Sittest thou to judge me  ACCORDING TO THE LAW  and commandest me to be smitten  CON∣TRARY TO LAW  Thus the a∣postle clearly explained the fitness and propriety of the reproachful figure of speech  whited wall  by which he had expressed the true character of the unworthy judge  An appellation similar to this was given even by our Lord himself to  the Scribes and Pharisees  who were the teachers and magistrates of the people  Wo unto you  SCRIBES  and  PHARI∣SEES HYPOCRITES  for ye are like unto  WHITED SEPULCHRES  which  indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness  Matth xxiii And in the context he calls them  "blind guides"  v  hypo∣crites  v  full of hypocrisy and iniquity  v  partakers in the blood of the prophets  v  ser∣pents    "generation of vipers"    "how can ye escape the damnation of hell"  c v Nay Herod himself the tetrarch of Galilee was not exempt∣ed from the severity of our Lord's cen∣sure when there was a proper occa∣sion to declare it for though our Lord lived for the most part under Herod's temporal jurisdiction that is in GALI∣LEE yet he openly characterised the  craf∣ty base  and  selfinterested  disposition of the TETRARCH by expressly cal∣ling him  a  FOX    "The message our Lord here sends to Herod"  says a sensible and learned commentator the Rev Mr  Francis Fox  in his edition of the New Testament with references set under the text in words at length  is no breach of that command which forbids the  SPEAKING EVIL OF THE RULER OF THE PEOPLE  and consequently is no blemish  says he  in our Lord's ex∣ample For our Lord here acts  AS A PROPHET  as one who had received an extraordinary commission from God and those who were truly  PROPHETS  were in the  EXECUTION  of their  COMMISSION  above the greatest  MEN  and most powerful princes whom they were not to spare when God sent them to reprove for sin  All this is certainly true with respect to the real autho∣rity of Christ to censure Herod and that his apply∣ing so harsh and severe an expression to the tetrarch  is no blemish in our Lord's example  but yet this is not I apprehend the proper method of reconciling the seeming difficulty which arises from this example of our Lord's applying a severe and reproachful epithet to a chief  ruler  in calling Herod a FOX when it is compared with that precept of the law which forbids the  speaking evil of the ruler of the people  for though our Lord had ample superiority and authority to re∣prove whomsoever he pleased even the greatest  ruler  upon earth yet with respect to  his own personal be∣haviour  as  a man  among  men  he claimed no autho∣rity to dispense with the positive precepts of the Mo∣saic law on account of his own real dignity or supe∣riority over the rest of mankind but strictly obeyed the law in all things and publicly declared his strict conformity thereto  "Think not"  said he  that I come to destroy the  LAW  or the  PROPHETS  I am not come to destroy but to fulfill  Matth v  "  By  THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS" says the same ingenious commentator above cited  are meant the great rules of life delivered in the writings of  MOSES  and the  PROPHETS  or in the Old Testament more especially the duties of the  MORAL  or  NATURAL LAW  from whence those respecting our beha∣viour to RULERS cannot with propriety be excluded  These our Lord assures us  HE DID NOT COME  to  DE∣STROY  or  DISSOLVE  It was not his design to  FREE  men from the obligation they were under to practise the  MORAL LAWS  of  GOD  but to fulfil and perfect them This our Lord did  BY LIVING UP TO THOSE LAWS HIMSELF  which totally excludes the idea of his dispensing on account of his own real superio∣rity with that  moral  law respecting behaviour to ru∣lers  and becoming thereby  AN EXAMPLE TO US  by freeing them from the corrupt glosses which the teachers among the Jews put upon them and by expound∣ing them in their fullest sense and according to their just latitude shewing that they command not only an  OUT∣WARD OBEDIENCE  but  THE OBEDIENCE  even of the  MIND  and  THOUGHTS  as appears in what our Lord delivers in the following verses These laws have their foundation in the reason and nature of things and therefore their obligation will never cease  Go ye and tell  that  FOX  c Luke xiii and though our Lord endured the most  provoking indignities from the licentious soldiery and reviling multitude  in si∣lence  answering not  a word  agreeable to that striking character of a suffering  Messiah so minutely described many ages before by the prophet Isaiah    He was oppressed and he was afflicted  YET HE OPENED NOT HIS MOUTH  he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers  IS DUMB SO HE OPENED NOT HIS MOUTH  He was taken from prison and from judgement and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken  Isaiah liii  yet he made an apparent distinction be∣tween the VIOLENCE  and  INJUSTICE of these as  individuals  and the INJUS∣TICE of a man in a  public character  as a  chief magistrate  for even in our Lord's state of extreme humiliation when his hour of sufferings was come he did not fail to rebuke  the  INJUSTICE of the  high priest  in his judicial capacity because instead of proceeding against him by the legal method of  examination by wit∣nesses  he had attempted to draw out matter of accusation from his own mouth against himself by INTERRO∣GATORIES according to the baneful method of arbitrary courts  But our Lord soon put a stop to his impertinent QUESTIONS by referring him to the legal method of finding evi∣dence by witnesses  Why  ASKEST  thou me  ASK  them which heard me what I have said unto them behold they know what I said  John xviii Upon which a timeserving of∣ficer who probably had not accustom∣ed himself to distinguish the different degrees of respect that are due to  good  and  bad  magistrates  gave Jesus a blow or rap with a rod    saying  Answerest thou the high priest so  v which open in∣justice to a person uncondemned even while he stood in the presence of the ma∣gistrate who ought to have protected him drew a farther  remonstrance  even from the meekest and humblest man that ever was on earth though the same divine person afterwards suffered much greater indignities  in silence  For  Je∣sus  answered him    If I have spo∣ken evil  said he  bear witness of the evil but if well why smitest thou me  V  This shews that the reprehension of magistrates and their officers for  in∣justice  and  abuse of power  is not incon∣sistent with the strictest rules of  Christi∣an  PASSIVE OBEDIENCE and though the apostle Paul in a similar case used much harsher language yet his censure was undoubtedly  just  and  true  and the severity of his expressions was plainly justified as I have already shewn by the event i e  by the fatal catastrophe of  ANANIAS The law therefore which forbids  the speaking evil of the ruler of the people  is certainly to be understood with proper exceptions so as not to ex∣clude any just censure of  rulers  when their  abuse of office  and the cause of  truth  and  justice  may render such cen∣sure  expedient and seasonable That the apostle Paul thus understood the text in question is manifest from his man∣ner of quoting it when he was charged with  reviling God's high priest  if the severity of his censure be compared with the indifference which he shewed im∣mediately afterwards towards the of∣fended  Sadducee  by openly professing himself to be of an opposite party and by throwing an oblique charge against the whole body of Sadducees as the principal authors of the unjust persecu∣tion against himself  I am a  PHARI∣SEE  said he  the son of a  PHA∣RISEE  of the hope and resurrection of the dead am I called in question  Acts xxiii Thus he manifestly threw the whole blame upon  the Sadducees  and thereby shewed no inclination to apolo∣gize for the severity of his speech to their dignified chief  I must farther remark that the a∣postle's behaviour in openly opposing the  high priest  who as such was also a  chief magistrate  and  judge  is by no means inconsistent with that excellent advice which the same apostle has laid down in the thirteenth chapter of his Epistle to the Romans though it is frequently cited by the advocates for ar∣bitrary power in order to justify their false notions concerning the necessity of  absolute submission and entire passive obe∣dience  To an inattentive reader indeed the apostle's expression may seem too much to favour such doctrines if the sense and connexion of the whole context are not carefully weighed together but though he said  Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers For there is no power but of God the pow∣ers that be are ordained of God Whoso∣ever  therefore resisteth the power re∣sisteth the ordinance of God and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation  Yet he immediately af∣terwards signifies what kind of  rulers  he spoke of "that were not to be resisted" "  For  RULERS" says he in the very next verse  ARE NOT A TERROR TO GOOD WORKS BUT TO THE EVIL  Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power do that which is  GOOD  and thou shalt have praise of the same for he is the  MINISTER  of  GOD  to thee for  GOOD  But ANANIAS as  a ruler  was certainly the very reverse of this description so that the practice of the apostle with respect to him was by no means opposite to this doctrine  "But"  says he  if thou do that which is  EVIL  be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is  THE MINISTER OF GOD  a revenger to  execute  wrath upon him that doeth evil Where∣fore  ye  must needs be subject not only  for wrath but also  FOR CONSCI∣ENCE SAKE  For this cause pay ye tribute also for they are  GOD'S MINI∣STERS  attending continually upon this very thing Render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tri∣bute  is due  custom to whom cus∣tom fear to whom fear honour  See pages and concerning the kind of magistrates to whom honour is or is not  due  to whom honour  Romans xiii to Now be pleased to remark that the apostle has expressly and repeatedly assigned the reason why so much respect and obedience is due to the  higher pow∣ers  or to the  ruler  or  magistrate  for he is  says the apostle  the  MINISTER "OF GOD TO THEE FOR GOOD"  c  and again  for he is the  MINISTER OF GOD  a revenger to wrath upon him that doeth evil  and again  FOR THEY ARE GOD'S MINISTERS  that is they are  God's ministers  while  they maintain  justice  and  righteousness  in the execution of their  public  charge howsoever deficient their characters may be in other respects as  private  individu∣als but on the other hand such an unjust  ruler  as  Ananias  for instance who  sat to judge  ACCORDING TO LAW  and yet commanded a person to be beaten  CON∣TRARY TO LAW such  a ruler  I say cannot be esteemed  a minister of God to us  FOR GOOD or  a minister of God  in any respect whatsoever A man who is notoriously guilty of perverting the laws and of abusing the delegated power with which he is entrusted by acts of  vio∣lence  and  injustice  is so far from being  "the minister of God"  that he is mani∣festly  "the minister of the devil"  which is the express doctrine of  the common law of this kingdom  according to the most approved and most antient autho∣rities wherein we find it applied not merely to inferior  rulers  but to the su∣preme  preme magistrate even to the  king  himself  The celebrated and learned  Henry de Bracton  says  that a king can do nothing else upon earth as he is  THE MINISTER  and  VICAR OF GOD  but that only which  BY LAW  he may do  c And a little farther he adds  "His power therefore"  says he  is of right  or law  and not of wrong  or in∣jury c    That a king ought therefore to exer∣cise the power of right  or LAW  as  THE VICAR AND MINISTER OF GOD  on earth because that power is of  GOD ALONE  but the power of  WRONG or INJU∣RY  is of the  DEVIL  and  NOT OF GOD  and the work of which so ever of these the king shall do of him  HE IS THE MINISTER  This is perfectly agreeable to the doctrine of holy Scripture  "Whosoever committeth sin"  said OUR LORD HIMSELF  is the servant  or minister  "of sin"  John viii Here is no exception or exclusive privilege allowed on account of  temporal dig∣nity  or  offices  of worldly power All men that wilfully  do evil  be they  high  or  low  are not only  servants of  SIN but also SONS as well as servants OF THE DEVIL as our Lord himself declared "  Ye do the deeds of  YOUR FATHER" c Ibid ver And when those men to whom he addressed himself still contended notwith∣standing their wicked deeds that they were  the sons and servants of God  Christ replied  "Why do ye not understand my speech" c    Ye are of  your  father  THE DEVIL  and the lusts of your father ye will do He was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him When he speaketh a lye be speaketh of his own for he is a lyar and the father of it  Ibid ver and And In like manner THE DEVIL is cortainly  the  FATHER or PROMOTER of every other immorality among men as much as he is of  murder lying  and  deceit  howsoever dignified the visible agents therein may be by the investiture of temporal honours titles and power or royal commissions  "Know ye not"  said the apostle Paul  that to whom ye yield yourselves  SERVANTS  to obey  HIS SERVANTS  or MINISTERS  ye are to whom you obey▪ whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness  Rom vi  whose work he shall do While therefore he does  JUSTICE  he is the  VICAR or MINISTER  of the  ETERNAL KING  but he is the  MINISTER  of the  DEVIL  while he turns aside to  IN∣JUSTICE  for he is called king  REX  from  WEDL RULING  and not from  REIGNING  because he is  KING  while he  RULES WELL  but a  TYRANT  while he oppresses the people committed to his charge with vio∣lent  or oppressive  government  Nihil enim aliud potest rex in terris CUM SIT DEI MINISTER ET VICARIUS nisi id solum quod  de jure  potest c Potestas itaque sua  juris  est et non  injuriae  c Exercere igitur debet rex potestatem  juris  sicut DEI VICARIUS ET MINISTER  in terra quia illa potestas solius Dei est  potestas autem  injuriae  DIA∣BOLI  non  DEI et cujus horum opera fecerit rex ejus MINISTER erit cujus opera fecerit Igitur  dum facit justitiam  VICARIUS EST REGIS AETERNI MINISTER AUTEM DIABOLI  dum declinet ad inju∣riam  Dicitur enim rex a bene regendo et non a regnando quia rex est dum bene regit tyrannus dum populum sibi creditum violenta opprimit dominatione  Henrici de Bracton de Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae lib iii c ix And nearly the same doctrine in substance is laid down in Fleta lib i c  if he  rules  contrary to  law by violating corrupting or per∣verting in any respect the powers of  government And that excellent con∣stitutional lawyer  Lord Sommers  informs us that ST EDWARD'S LAW even goes farther  The judgement of whole kingdoms and na∣tions concerning the rights power and prerogative of KINGS and the rights privileges and proper∣ties of the PEOPLE c See the st paragraph  viz  That unless the king performs his duty and answers the end for which he was constituted not so much  AS THE NAME OF A KING  shall remain in him  Now when these constitutional principles of  the English law  are collated and duly compared with the precepts before cited from the apostle Paul they are so far from being contradictory that the full and clear meaning of them all may be maintained together without the least inconsistency or discrepance of doctrine for we may surely say with the apostle  "Render to all their dues"  c without seeming to favour the pernicious and dangerous doctrine of an  unlimited pas∣sive  obedience  Render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tri∣bute  is due  custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honour to whom honour  For though  custom tribute fear  and  honour  are certainly due to him who is the MINISTER OF GOD  to us for good  yet surely no honour is  due  or ought to be  rendered  to THE MINISTER OF THE DEVIL to the perjured violater of a public trust who in the eye of the English law is not even worthy of  so much as the name of a king  Fear  indeed may too often be said to  be due  to such men when in power but it is a very different sort of  fear  from that reverential  fear  which  is due  to him who  is the minister of God to us for good  It is such  a fear  only as that which men have of a  wild beast  that devours the flock He is  fierce  and  strong  say they and therefore each indi∣vidual through fear of  personal inconveni∣ence to himself  is induced to wink at the ruinous depredations made upon  his neigh∣bours  and  brethren  so that for want of a prudent and timely opposition the vora∣cious animal which in a state is a many∣headed monster becomes stronger and more dangerous to the community at large till the unwary timeservers them∣selves perceive when it is too late that by their own selfish connivance re∣spectively as individuals they have been accessaries to the general ruin and as such must one day be answerable to God for their shameful breach of that LAW OF LIBERTY  See my Tract on the  Law of Liberty    Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself  in which we are assured  all the law is fulfilled    For all the law is fulfilled  in one word even in this  thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself  Gala∣tians v  and by which we are also assured  we  shall be  judged    So speak ye and so do as they that shall be JUDGED  by the law of liberty  James ii  This heavenly  principle  is the true and proper ground for  patriotism  and undoubtedly has always been the pre∣dominant motive of great and good men such as the disinterested and loyal apo∣stle Paul following his Lord's exam∣ple in their opposition to the injustice of  rulers  and  magistrates  though they  passively  submit to personal injuries from other hands for in this as I have al∣ready remarked consists the due dis∣tinction between the necessary  Christian submission to personal injuries  and the doctrine of an  unlimited passive obedience  The SUBJECTION and OBEDIENCE to MAGISTRATES enjoined by the same apostle in his Epistle to Titus c iii must certainly be understood with the  same necessary limitations  Put them in mind  says the apostle TO BE SUB∣JECT TO PRINCIPALITIES AND POWERS TOOBEY MAGISTRATES    says he but then he im∣mediately subjoins  to be ready to e∣very good work  And no man can be esteemed  ready to every good work  if he is  obedient  to magistrates when their commands exceed the due li∣mits of the law or if contrary to the ex∣ample of the apostle himself he neglects a fair opportunity of publicly discounten∣ancing and censuring any notorious per∣version of  justice and right  by a magistrate  The same necessary limitation of the doctrine of  obedience  must also be un∣derstood when we read the exhortation of another apostle on this head viz  Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake whether it be to the  KING  as supreme or  unto  GOVERNORS  as unto them that are sent by him  FOR THE PUNISH∣MENT OF EVIL DOERS  and for the  PRAISE OF THEM THAT DO WELL  For so is the will of God that with  WELLDOING  ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men as free and not using  your  liberty for a cloke of maliciousness but as the servants of God  Peter ii GOVER∣NORS are here declared to be sent  for the punishment of evil doers  and for the  praise of them that do well  to such there∣fore as answer this description the  sub∣mission  and  honour  enjoined in the context are undoubtedly due but whenever the governors themselves become  the evil do∣ers  and like  Ananias  instead of praising and encouraging  "them that do well"  do notoriously abuse oppress and mur∣der them  as he did  The apostle Paul was so far from retracting any part of his severe censure and remonstrance against Ananias that he afterwards before Felix defied Ananias and the rest of his accusers to shew that he had been guilty of any the least misdemeanour ever since his last arrival at Jerusalem and more particularly while  "he stood before the council"  meaning the time when he foretold that God should smite that  whited wall  Ananias "or else" said he to Felix  let these same here say  meaning the high priest  Ananias  the elders and their orator Tertullus mentioned in the first verse of the chapter  if they have found any  EVIL DOING  The word in the original is  signifying rather  injustice  or  unrighteousness  than EVILDOING and as the former may be essected by  words  as well as by  deeds  this public challenge from the mouth of the apostle includes a complete justification of all that he either  said  or  did  on that day  before the council  IN ME WHILE I STOOD BEFORE THE COUNCIL  except it be for this one voice  now he once more provokes the malicious Sadducee  that I cried standing among them Touching  THE RESUR∣RECTION OF THE DEAD  I am called in question by you this day  Acts xxiv This is a manifest declaration that there was nothing reprehensible either in his  behaviour  or  words  on that day  before the council  because his declaration concerning the  re∣surrection of the dead  was the only  one voice  or ex∣pression which he supposed these Sadducees could call in question and lay to his charge  it would be a  manifest perversion of the text to sup∣pose that we are required thereby to  submit ourselves to every ordinance of  man  The apostles and disciples of Christ were so far "from  submitting themselves to every ordinance of man  " that they boldly rejected the  unjust  commands even of the high priest and the whole national council of the Jewish state The great council called SANHEDRIM i e  the commands of which they rejected in∣cluded at that time all persons of their nation that bore any public authority or dignity among them for the text expressly informs us that  their  RULERS  and  ELDERS  and  SCRIBES  and  ANNAS THE HIGH PRIEST  and the  high priests  since the time of the Maccabees were generally considered as a sort of prin∣ces  and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest were gathered together at Jerusalem  No power therefore amongst the Jews could be more respectable in regard to temporal authority than this great national council and the apostle Pe∣ter accordingly acknowledged their legal authority at first by respectfully addressing them saying  Ye rulers of the people and elders of Israel  c  Yet notwithstanding the temporal authority of this awful assembly of  rulers  and  elders  or senators they were publicly disregarded and contradicted by the a∣postles even in their presence upon the very first pro∣posal of an  unreasonable  and  unlawful  ORDINANCE for  "they called them"  the apostles  and  COMMANDED THEM  not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus  But  Peter and John answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God judge ye For we cannot but speak the things we have seen and heard  Acts iv and And afterwards when they were brought a second time before the said great council to answer for their breach of this  ORDINANCE OF MAN  the high priest asked them saying  DID NOT WE STRAIGHTLY COMMAND YOU  that you should not teach in this name and behold ye have filled Jeru∣salem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood upon us Then Peter and the other apostle an∣swered and said  WE OUGHT TO OBEY GOD RA∣THER THAN MEN  c This sentence in effect holds good with respect also to the rejection of  every public ordinance  that is contrary to  reason justice  or  natural equity  as well as those that are contrary to  the written word of God  This I have shewn more at large in my Declaration of the People's Right  without admitting such just and necessary exceptions to the doctrine  as I have already cited from the example of the apostle Paul and even from that of our Lord himself  And therefore though the apostle Peter adds  Honour all  men  love the brotherhood fear God honour the king  yet he must necessarily be understood to mean with the apostle Paul that we must render  honour to whom honour  is DUE and not to  honour  such  men  and such  kings  as are unworthy of  honour  To the example of the patriotic apostle Paul upon this point I must now add that of another cho∣sen vessel of Christ the protomartyr  Stephen  this excellent man  "full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom"  Acts vi  "full of faith and power"  v  and whose wisdom and spirit none were able to resist  v This excellent man I say has left us by his own example an unquestionable precedent on re∣cord to demonstrate that HONOUR IS NOT DUE to the highest temporal authority on earth not even to a  great national council of rulers and elders  while they ex∣ercise their authority in  unjust  prosecutions and abuse their power by enacting  unreasonable and tyrannical or∣dinances  The great council of the Jewish state had  "straightly commanded"  the aposties and disciples of Christ as I have already remarked in a preceding note  not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus  which command it seems was given lest their preaching should  "bring this man's blood"  said the high priest meaning the blood of our LORD JESUS  "upon us"  but  Stephen  paid so little regard either to the  unlawful  command itself or to the reason of it that he afterwards publicly upbraided the whole coun∣cil with the high priest at the head of it in the most stimulating and unreserved terms as the betrayers and murderers of that just One  Ye stiffnecked and un∣circumcised in heart and ears  said he to their faces in the public assembly  ye do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers  did  so  do  ye Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted And they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the  JUST ONE  of whom ye have been now the  BETRAY∣ERS  and  MURDERERS  c Acts vii and Words could not well be  sharper  than these which is manifest from their  effect  for the text testifies that  when they heard these things they were  CUT TO THE HEART  and they gnashed on him with  their  teeth  V Thus it clearly appears that the holy inno∣cent and meek Stephen did not think himself bound like our undistinguishing  passiveobedience  men to  sub∣mit to every ordinance of man  c nor to  honour all men  without making reasonable and due excep∣tions Nay so far from  honouring  men merely on account of their  temporal dignity  it is manifest that he treated the whole  body of rulers  with the utmost severity and contempt while he thought them  unworthy of honour  and yet there is no doubt but that he most conscienti∣ously on every occasion rendered  honour to whom honour  WAS DUE  But what men it will be said are to be esteemed the proper  judges of desert  in such cases so as to determine with propriety when  honour  is or is not to be rendered To which I answer  Every man  is a judge of it if he be not an idiot or mad man  Every man  of common sense can distinguish  jus∣tice  from  injustice right  from  wrong  honourable  from  dishonourable  See my Tract on  the Law of Nature and the Principles of Action in Man  wherein I hope this point is fully demonstrated  when∣ever he happens to be an eye or ear witness of the proper circumstances of evidence for such a judgement  Every man  except as above be he ever so poor and mean with respect to his rank in this life inherits  the knowledge of good and evil  or REASON from the common parents of mankind and is thereby rendered answerable to GOD for  all  his actions and answerable to MAN for  many  of them  In this  hereditary knowledge  and in the proper use of it according to the different stations of life in which men subsist in this world consists the  equality  of ALL MANKIND in the sight of GOD and also in the eye of  the law  I mean the  common law  and rules of  natural jus∣tice  which are formed upon the self∣evident  conclusions of  human reason  and are the necessary result of the above∣mentioned  hereditary knowledge in  MAN Every man  knows  by what we call  conscience  which is only an effect of  human reason  upon the mind whether his own actions deserve the  censure  of the  magistrate who  bears not the sword in vain  And the same prin∣ciple of  hereditary knowledge  enables him to judge also concerning the out∣ward actions of  other men  whether they be  just  or  unjust  whether they be  praise∣worthy  or  censurable  But if a man abuses his own  natural reason  and suffers himself to be blinded by private interest by passion or un∣reasonable resentment or by pride en∣vy or personal partiality and is there∣by led to misconstrue the actions of his superiors to behave unseemly to∣wards them and to censure them pub∣licly  without a just cause the  consci∣ence  of such an offender against  rea∣son  will speedily inform him that he has cause to  fear the magistrate  and that he is liable to suffer for his misbe∣haviour  "as an evil doer"  but when the like faults are discoverable on the o∣ther side that is on the side of the superior or magistrate as it happened in the case of Ananias a  just  censure of the  unjust  magistrate even though it comes from the poorest and meanest man that happens to be present will have its due weight in the opinion of all unprejudiced and disinterested per∣sons and may occasion a considerable check to the progress of  injustice  and therefore if any man neglects such an opportunity when he has it in his power of making a personal  protest  as Paul did against the public injustice of a wicked magistrate he strengthens the hand of iniquity by his timidity  and remissness and becomes accessary to the public disgrace by refusing his endeavours according to his abilities howsoever small to vindicate the  laws of God  and maintain the  common rights of his neighbours and brethren  Such an one unhappily demonstrates that he has more  fear  of MAN than of GOD and much more  love  for  himself  than he has for his  neighbour  and  country  and consequently in that awful day when he  shall be judged by the law of liber∣ty  James ii See also my Tract on  the Law of Liberty  must be liable unless a timely repentance should have previously restored him to a better use of that  he∣reditary knowledge  for which all men are accountable must be liable I say  to be cast with  the unprofitable ser∣vant into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth  Matth xxv  ALL MEN therefore be they ever so  rich  or ever so  poor  and  mean  are REQUIRED to vindicate the cause of  truth justice  and  righteousness  when∣ever they have a favourable opportunity of doing so they ARE REQUIRED I say because they ARE ENABLED by their NATURAL KNOWLEDGE of GOOD and EVIL to discern and judge concerning the  fitness  or  unfitness  of human actions and of the  justice  or  injustice  of all mea∣sures and proceedings that happen to fall within the reach of their inspection and consequent observation He who denies this is ignorant of the  true dig∣nity of human nature  and wants a teacher to point out to him not only  the equality of mankind before God  but also  the uni∣versal conditions of man's subsistence in the world  THE HEREDITARY KNOW∣LEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL may at least be esteemed as the ONE TALENT  for which  all mankind  are accountable to the universal Lord And therefore if they wilfully  abuse  or  bury  THIS TALENT they have surely nothing to expect but the condemnation above∣mentioned of the  unprofitable servant  Shall we blame the patriotic apostle then for his zeal in vindicating  the natu∣ral rights of mankind  against an UNJUST JUDGE when he had so fair an op∣portunity of protesting against his ini∣quity God forbid Let us on the contrary revere his example which in reality affords no opposition to the doctrine laid down in the beginning of this Tract concerning the necessity of  Christian submission to personal inju∣ries  If he sometimes freely and courageously expressed his  resentment for personal ill usage  In pursuing the examination of this subject con∣cerning  resentment for personal ill usage  I was gradually led to consider the present unnatural though prevailing practice of DUELLING and this occasioned my  Re∣marks on the Opinions of some of the most eminent Wri∣ters on  CROWN LAW  respecting the due distinction between  MANSLAUGHTER  and  MURDER  printed in which Remarks were at first intended as a continuation of this tract but finding soon afterwards that some publication to correct the common mistaken doctrines concerning  manslaughter  and  duelling  was be∣come more immediately necessary I thought it ad∣viseable to detach what I had written on that subject from this tract and to print it as soon as possible with some sew alterations and additions rather than to wait for the publication of these other tracts  it was al∣ways  ways in vindication of  the law  on which next to the providence of God the safety liberty and happiness of the community depend whereas the  hasty revenger of his own cause  is so far from being a friend to the com∣munity or a  lover of liberty  that he himself is actually  a tyrant  because he neglects the necessary doctrine of  Chris∣tian submission to personal injuries  and on every occasion is ready to re∣venge his  own cause  with his  own hand  and to usurp all the distinct offices of  judge jury and executioner He is so far from vindicating  the law  like the generous and patriotic apostle for the sake of  national liberty  that he manifest∣ly sets himself up  above the law  which is  the first characteristic of a tyrant  and thereby renders himself in fact an open enemy to  liberty  and consequently  a disgrace to society  GRANVILLE SHARP
