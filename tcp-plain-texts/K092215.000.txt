Perusal nor think me prone to Flattery I could wish it was more worthy your Attention but am convinced if not from its intrinsic Merit at least for its Author's Sake you will condescend to look upon it with some little Candour and Respect With these flattering Hopes I take Leave to subscribe myself  Your truly affectionate And devoted humble Servant WILLIAM HAWKINS  May  th  PREFACE  The piece you think is incorrect why take it  I'm all submission what you'd have it make it  POPE  THE following pages are the first efforts of a youthful mind and was wrote purely for the Author's amusement and now first collected and revised with such alterations additions and improvements as he thought  necessary to make at the particular request of the young Lady to whom the book is addressed though he thinks it but justice to inform the readers that many of the articles contained in this work he has at different times inserted in Magazines and other periodical publications particularly what he then called Remarks on the Principal Performers but as they were too precipitately written he has wrote the following Observations on a more judicious and extensive plan by selecting what useful matter he thought necessary from the former and having interspersed it with what he has now written by which  he flatters himself this undertaking trifling as he is sensible it must appear wlll be thought far superior to the former as he has given an account of all the Principal Performers that have appeared at either of the Theatres from the time he formerly set out to the present Period He has likewise added a CONCLUSION wherein the Merits and Demerits of most of the inferior Performers are set forth Therefore after saying thus much he has nothing more to plead to his courteous Readers nor to judge Criticism and his critical Court of Inquest than by declaring his sole Motive for giving Birth to this Production  was entirely to oblige the aforesaid young Lady with that View he humbly submits it to Perusal of the indulgent Public at the same time hoping the sew auxiliary Forces he has been obliged to call in from other Authors will be deemed Venial and with humble Dependence on Candour and generous Criticism he launches his little Pinnance trembling from the Shore  SUBSCRIBERS NAMES  THomas Alder Esq  Thomas Atkins  Esq  copies  Mr John Ansell  Mr William Allen  Mr John

Distance from the Press  CANDID and IMPARTIAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE PRINCIPAL PERFORMERS  DRURYLANE  DAVID GARRICK ESQ  _THE first on the list of theatrical fame stands the inimitable Roscius one of the greatest ornaments that ever decked the English Stage but whose excellencies are best described in the words of his favourite and immortal poet  Shakespeare  He is a man take him for all in all  We ne'er shall look upon his like again  HAMLET Act I Scene  So many pens of almost all ranks and denominations in literature for these thirty years past have been employed in treating of Mr  Garrick  both as an actor and a writer that I must confess I find it a difficult task to collect untouched materials as such I shall not at this time presume to enter into the merit or demerit of this firstrate ornament of the British Stage for fear I should become a vile encroacher and consequently make use of another man's property as my own therefore in order to avoid as much as possible this observation I shall only give my courteous readers a description of his person though at the same time I must beg leave to intersperse a little borowed matter in order to speak of him with more precision than I probably might without these materials But to his person Mr  Garrick  though low in stature is regularly made and well proportioned his face is strongly and finely featured but on the whole not handsome and yet much less cannot be said to the contrary His eyes have  been ever and universally admired their cut is what a painter would call bold and perfect their size is big the pupil large strong lively active and variable their colour dark surrounded and set off with a due proportion of white that gives to their every motion a brilliancy a distinctness a life that speaks in every glance His complexion is dark and lastly his voice which from its harmony sweetness and moreover from it's pliancy and extensive variety has ever been admired Having given a brief and just account of Mr  Garrick's  person I shall proceed to relate the names of some of the most celebrated characters this great actor shines in without attempting to enter into his excellence in any particular for fear I should suffer for my presumption and run my account of this gentleman into a prolixity of useless and unmeaning matter as such my intention is to touch upon Mr  Garrick  as well as the following performers in general in as true and concise manner as possible But I shall proceed to relate a few  of the various parts he is most eminent in which in tragedy are Macbeth Lear Richard Hamlet Lusignan Dorilas c c In comedy Able Drugger Benedick Kitely Ranger Archer Don Felix c c Were I capable of communicating to the reader the names of all the various characters Mr  Garrick  excels in and likewise to point out his excellence in each particular part it problably might swell to the size of a large volume they are indeed so numerous as to leave sufficient room for me to make this remark that in short the most explicit and accurate manner I can find in summing up this gentleman's character as an actor is by the following lines  The tragic muse her laurel crown bestows  To fix it blooming on her GARRICK's brows  The comic muse her mask has made his own  And SHAKESPEARE lives whilst lives his Darling Son  Having said thus much on our English Roscius I shall conclude and proceed to the next on the list at DruryLane theatre which I believe is cordially allowed to stand  Mr SMITH  Mr SMITH is a very pleasing and judicious actor and in the parts of the unaffected wellbred gentleman he irreproachably claims the foremost rank on the stage for uniform elegance ease and suitable vivacity His person is likewise one of the genteelest that I know and his whole deportment admirably polite and affable What a pity it is that this actor should so often mistake his abilities by straying out of that road which nature has so happily placed him in did he retain less thoughts of his unfavourable muse Melpomene and confine himself more to his best friend Thalia I would insure his success to be much greater than it is as not one upon  the stage would have a chance to equal him in his walk not but I must allow Mr  Smith  to have many capital requisites for a tragedian but he is apt to wade out of his depth and were it not for his agility and good sense I am persuaded he would sometimes be in danger of drowning wherefore I greatly prefer in him the comedian to the tragedian he is more selfbred and has a greater variety in the former than in the latter in tragedy he has too much levity and wants expression and his voice though clear and sonorous wants variation as he scarce ever speaks but in one continual tone yet he possesses great fervour and manly spirit particularly in his Richard his Alexander and the like his Jachimo his Phocyas in the siege of Damascus  c  are inimitable and his late attempt in Orestes in the Distress'd Mother has deservedly gained him no small share of applause being chaste and respectable throughout the whole And were there not quite such a repeated sameness in Mr  Smith  's  action and voice there would be no doubt of his becoming a very accomplished actor  Smith is at once the manly and genteel  Feels all himself and teaches all to feel  I hope I shall find this gentleman in future to merit this little encomium I have inscribed to him▪ and I wish I could with critical justice declare it at present  Mr REDDISH  Mr REDDISH possesses some strokes of very conspicuous merit though many degrees inferior to a gentleman he assumes to equal I mean Mr Barry yet vanity I am told has often prompted him to declare himself second to none but Mr  Garrick▪  O man man why art thou so vainTill Mr  Reddish  can divest himself of a stiff heavy figure a set face and a broken monotony of voice he may assure himself the seeing and sagacious public will rate him far  inferior to the above gentleman Mr  Reddish  without doubt has a tolerable good share of judgment in his profession whereby it renders him very useful in the various parts he performs but with all the vanity he may possess himself with he never will be able to fill a first form at least not at such a theatre as DruryLane for in many characters he wants variety likewise expression and a pliancy of features to exert his exterior powers were he endowed with Mr  Barry  's features and voice no doubt but he'd fall very little short of that gentleman's abilities but as dame Nature has not been so favourable in adapting him with Mr  Barry  's theatrical requisites I would advise him to content himself as he is and not let ambition reign in his breast for fear it should prove hurtful to him as he never can prefume to reach capital excellence except in a few particular parts as Edgar in Lear Moneses in Tamerlain  c  wherefore I am under the indespensable necessity  of rating Mr  Reddish  not as a very capital but an exceeding useful performer  Reddish forbear thyself to overrate  And let not vanity contaminate  Mr AICKIN  This actor's forte seems to lie mostly in the impassioned declamatory parts of tragedy in which he without doubt deserves notice He has of late made some few attempts in comedy but I cannot by any means admire him in the sock although his person and voice are both agreeable yet he wants that natural ease and vivacity in his manner so peculiarly necessary for the comedian without which he never can render himself considerable in this though there are some few parts wherein he makes a tolerable and decent appearance as Stockwell in the West Indian and Sir John Flowerdale in the School for Fathers these being best suited to his manner of acting  so that take him altogether from his judgment  c  in the cast of parts he is in possession of he may be deemed a very useful and judicious actor  Aickin was sorm'd by judgment and by use  Which seldom fail some merit to produce  {inverted ⁂} This gentleman has quitted Drury Lane Theatre  Mr KING  This favourite gentleman's outset was in some of the country companies After being tired with his country pursuits he came to London and engaged himself at DruryLane Theatre and what is very remarkable Mr  King  during the whole time of his engagement at this theatre never was known once to fill a character that seemed suitable to his talents this probably was the motive that induced him at that time to quit DruryLane and engage himself  under the banners of Mr Sheridan in Ireland it being here where he broke out a comedian of the first rank He remained in Ireland for several years but from a fracas happening among the principal performers of that theatre he quitted his service like a valiant soldier and came over once more to general Garrick where ever since he has continued to be one of the greatest favourites on the stage by giving such repeated proofs of his excellent performance as rank him Mr Garrick excepted the best comedian on the English stage take all in all perhaps the best And as a prologue speaker in the comic style I would ask where is his equal the above gentleman once more excepted he possesses in an eminent degree that lively spirited and quick sensation in his manner which is so admirably adapted for speaking this kind of writing But above all is that sly knowledge of the world which is so excellently blended in Mr  King's  features and in his action that it oftimes  sends home effects to the furthermost and remotest seats of the galleries c  When lively sense and fancy ever new  The path dramatic with their poesies strew  Their sweet effluvia to our senses bring  Their lavish essence by their envoy King  Mr MOODY  This performer's justly admired abilities are in the parts of Irishmen in those characters he has rose to eminence being prosessedly the best exhibiter of Irishmen now on either stage and yet it is not only in Irishmen Mr  Moody  excels for he is likewise capital in many parts of low comedy I believe we may wish in vain for a better Commodore Flip in the Fair Quaker of Deal and Adam in As you like It or a Vamp in the Author There is considerable ease and propriety in his manner of acting especially in his Irishmen these characters  he supports with so much judgment and humour that of late Mr  Moody  has become no less a favourite with the boxes than he is with the galleries  Moody to thee what height of mirth we owe  What high burlesque and mimicry that's low  Mr DODD  Mr DODD in the genteel affected coxcomb is certainly an original and I am informed he is no less so by nature is his private deportment as well as on the stage if this circumstance be true we need not longer wonder at his excelling every other actor in this species of comedy as he doubtless must be quite at home in personating such characters Though I have seen him with equal merit in some parts of low comedy as such I should imagine Mr  Dodd  has it in his power to be as much the Sir Gravity as the Sir Fopling for instance  his Andrew Ague Cheek in the Twelfth Night his Crispn in the Anatomist and Old Kicksy in the Irish Widow are laughable in the highest degree He is likewise exceeding useful in several singing parts having a tolerable good though rather artificial voice On the whole Mr  Dodd  will be found very acceptable in any theatre  Dodd play the coxcomb the affected beau  But in thy conductbe not really so  The author hopes Mr Dodd will not be piqued at this hint  {inverted ⁂} I should have mentioned Mr WESTON immediately after this gentleman but being a principal member of Mr FOOTE's society I think it rather inconsistent with my plan  Mr LOVE  Mr LOVE was a useful performer in the walk of comedy he was in possession of  as Falstaff Jaques Sir Toby Belch Caleban Jobson  c  those characters were best adapted to his unweildy figure and moreover suited to his manner of acting his voice was somewhat a  matical and abounded with many inharmonious tones however he more than supplied this defect from his judgment and knowledge in his authors so that he was unequalled in his cast of parts This actor was taken off this great stage of life about twelve months since his loss is regretted by all his admirers in his profession and by alll those who knew him to be an honest and    For Falstaff Jaques for Belch or Caleban  Love was the monster if you pleas'd the man  Mr PARSONS  This Actor's forte lies in the characters of old men in which he without doubt claims originality from his admirable great ease  and masterly strokes of humour which he shows in those parts that for the moment we are sometimes led to believe him to be the man he represents from that exquisite feeble tottering in his manner and the wrinkledness of old age which appears so very conspicuous in the muscles of his face and in his whole deportment that we must inevitably rank him a finished actor in his walk  Parsons well skill'd attention to engage  Tho' young supports each requisite of age  Mr VERNON  Though as the principal vocal performer of Drurylane theatre I must confess I can find but little entertainment from his singing yet I make no doubt but Mr  Vernon  has many admirers but there appears to me to be such an affected stiffness in his manner as if he enjoyed more pleasure from his own harmony than his audience  does  Vernon  without doubt has a very good knowledge of music though in point of voice I think him by no means in competition with your Mattocks's DuBellamy's c at the other house notwithstanding there are many may wantonly contradict what I have here set down yet were they to hear him sing in private company without the help of music they'd be as conscious of this as myself who have been ear witness of this assertion As an actor Mr  Vernon  undoubtedly has merit in many parts of comedy and did not too apparent a coxcomb eternally settle itself on his features there would be no doubt of his acquiring much more applause in his profession than he has yet attained  Music held judgment nature held a voice  Of music's present Vernon made his choice  Mr BADDELEY  Mr BADDELEY is a useful man among the secondary class of actors a good low comedian and exceeding clever in foreign footmen which seems to be chiefly his forte his faults are but few as he seldom strays out of the common road or beyond his abilities a good Varland in the WestIndian a decent Trinculo in the Tempest or Polonius in Hamlet and not a bad Touchstone notwithstanding Mr King's superior abilities in this part he is far from being a contemptible copy on the whole he is a very useful and just performer  Smiles comedy by ev'ry feature won  And owns that Baddeley's her real son  Mr PALMER  Mr PALMER is a promising actor and what we may call a handsome and portly figure save an unpardonable stoop and aukward gait his voice is loud and commanding but neither pleasing nor distinct nor is his expression and action so animated and refined as could be wished Yet he is respectable in several parts of tragedy and comedy and would he endeavour to give his body a little more steadiness he cannot fail when placed in his proper sphere of acting to meet applause  Palmer with caution act your part and try  To win our praises and to fix our eye  Mr CAUTHERLEY  What apology can I make to the allseeing public for introducing this young  man who with scare one requisite except his person which is remarkably genteel figures away in your Hamlet's Romeo's Dorilass Barnwells c For Heaven sake managers how can you impose on the public and the goodnatured young man's abilities in so egregious a manner to thrust him into parts where he has not the least glimmering merit to suport them for be assured and your own judgments must needs tell ye that all the partiality you are pleased to indulge this actor with will never render him a feast for public entertainment in the buskin From that prodigious sameness in his manner faintness and want of expression and above all his effeminate look and voice which are so very inconsistent for supporting the dignity of tragedy that in short the only and best advice I can give Mr  Cautherley  is to reject all the managers' future favours of this kind and never more sacrifice to his unmerciful performance those excellent compositions of blank verse he has hitherto been guilty of but pursue the  same track of comedy he is in possession with where he is far superior than in the  mer or at last decent in many parts and with a little more cultivation of his talents and attention to his profession Mr  Cautherliy  may become no inconsiderable performer in the sock  Of Cautherley if aught the muse should say  For scribbling sake she must advance the lay  I should have been more favourable with this actor but according to the rules of impartial criticism he merits that censure I have thus frankly put upon him therefore if I offend as I presume I shall I humbly crave his pardon  Mrs YATES  This great actress in the present theatrical hemisphere shines a persect constellation  i e  in the haughty and passionate parts of tragedy here she surpasses all her female  cotemporaries and ascends to the topmost seat of perfection particularly in her favourite character Mandane in Cyrus and the like Hence we find excellence but barely answering her deserts from her noble presence majestic gait piercing eyes and voice with manner and action so suitably great that she seldom fails of transporting the most rustic or refined into admiration but where tender passions stiffled pangs or soft feelings are to be expressed Mrs  Yates  is quite at a loss Here we must indisputably call forth her rival Mrs Barry who appears in the former's deficiencies like Melpomene herself and with such tender expression and graceful action as must excite every feeling auditor and strike criticism dumb thus we are to view Mrs Yates amazingly great in scenes of rage and disdain and as cordially admire Mrs Barry in grief and despair though I shall not presume to draw any farther competition of those two ladies excellencies for fear I should exceed the bounds of simple truth and render it too  profuse for a work of this kind wherefore I shall only give a concise account of Mrs Yates in the comic walk where I cannot speak much in her praise notwithstanding she supports several polite parts with tolerable applause as Lady Townly Mrs Oakley Violante in the Wonder  c  but we must impute her success solely to her genteel figure and easy carriage as such I am sorry to differ so much from public opinion which seems so warm in this lady's favour by pronouncing her far beneath Mrs  Barry  as a general actress  Although possess'd of lovely charms to please  Majesty grace gentility and ease  Mrs ABINGTON  The next on the list of female excellence stands one of the greatest favourites of Thalia Mrs  Abington  this true and perfect actress's much admired abilities lie chiefly  in genteel comedy and in low comedy she is unequalled by any in the parts she is in possession of where her great variety elegance of dress and acquired accomplishments render her without exception the best female comedian on the English stage And what Colley Cibber observes in his apology of the celebrated Mrs Oldfield I think may justly be applied to the accomplishments of Mrs  Alington  which is "That many women of the first rank might copy some part of her behaviour without the least diminition of their sense or dignity"  Grace in her steps in ev'ry motion love  She looks a being from the realms above  Miss YOUNGE  This thriving and meritorious actress made her first appearance at Drurylane theatre about five or six years ago in the part of Imogen in Cymbeline though a  a difficult part for a young actress to execute yet she acquitted herself to the entire satisfaction and amazement of the audience▪ and like the lastmentioned lady stands in the foremost circle of female excellence as she has since the first time of her commencement given such proofs of her theatrical powers both in tragedy and comedy for the critics to rate her an object of honour in candid criticism her abilities being sufficiently conspicuous to induce them to make this observation but her talents are mostly inclined to the former She is happily suited to the dignity of tragedy being perfectly well made and much indebted to nature for a pliancy of features which mark the passions she would present with great expressionAnd I make no doubt in the walks of tragedy of one day seeing her at the summit of perfection  Younge if to true perfection you'd aspire  Give nature freedom and we must admire  Miss POPE  Miss POPE without doubt may be accounted a first ornament in her walk which is mostly in the parts of low comedy and she seems to be an imitation of the celebrated Mrs Clive or as the critics stile her a second edition of that lady Ever since Mrs Clive's retreat from the stage she has been in possession of most of her principal parts and I must confess I think her in some characters very little desicient in execution as Nell in the Devil to pay Beatrice in Muchado about Nothing or Phillis in the Conscious Lovers in these she is without exception matchless and in many other characters too numerous to mention she possesses great spirit and agreeable pertness in her manner Though as to her figure it is rather bulky and unweildy of which the critics have lately complained  as they think it prevents her from giving that scope to her abilities they could wish yet as Churchill remarks on two celebrated performers  Before such merit all distinctions fly  Prichard's genteel and Garrick's six feet high  On the whole from her extensive judgment and easy manner we must undoubtedly rate her a very useful judicious and capital performer  Her lively fancy can the stoic draw  In peals of laughter to confess her law  Mrs BADDELEY  Mrs BADDELEY is a smart and pleasing figure an agreeable actress and very useful as a singer but for virtue modesty cries hush I shall not dwell upon this little defect as it is a frailty most of our theatrical  ladies are so much accustomed to that were I to commence on this topic I should extend my remarks beyond the bounds of decency and reason not but I believe there are many amiable and virtuous women on the stage But our heroine in particular pleads the part of chastity in her characters with so much grace simplicity and propriety that were we not sensible to the contrary we might without a doubt imagine it to be her natural qualification However as a passionate admirer of Mrs  Baddeley  in her profession I heartily with her well and all the applause her merit deserves Yet  Immodesty's the source of ev'ry evil  It's artful wiles can overreach the devil  I am sorry to pay this lady so bad a compliment but in justice to her character I thought proper to make this remark  Mrs EGERTON  Mrs EGERTON has merit in several parts of comedy as Lady Townly in the Provoked Husband Mrs Cadwallader in the Author and a number of other characters She has likewise a very pleasing person and generally possesses the true spirit of her author and her performance is easy spirited and enlivening in a word she is a very useful and pleasing actress  Made to engage all eyes and win all hearts  We'll name her queen of Cytherean darts  {inverted ⁂} This lady has left the stage and retired to love and enjoyment where an author observes the righteous rest from their labour  Mrs SMITH  Mrs SMITH came out the winter before last at Drurylane where she has in the season continued to perform during that period the part she first acted was that of Sylvia in the dramatic romance of Cymon in which she was received with universal applause She has since performed several other principal singing characters with great success particularly Polly in the Beggar's Opera Rosetta in Love in a Village Patty in the Maid of the Mill c She is a smart little figure with an admirable sweet musical voice and sings with the nicest precision of any lady I ever remember to have heard excepting the late Mrs Arne she seems to hit off that lady's manner exactly both in singing and action Mrs  Smith  fince Mr Garrick's alteration of Hamlet has occasionally appeared in that play in the part of Ophelia with so much  judgment and ease as for us in reason to hope we may one day admire her as much an actress as we now do in her singing and this if she adds a little more spirit to her manner we have no room to doubt  When Smith pours forth her sweetest serenade  She rivals Daulia in the vernal shade  COVENTGARDEN  SPRANGER BARRY ESQ  FEW people in the theatrical province I believe are ignorant that we are indebted to Ireland for the birth of this gentleman and likewise to his early misfortunes that occasioned him to make an attempt on the stage a profession he certainly by nature was designed for and where he has shone for upwards of thirty years past with so much profit to himself and pleasure to the public as only to be rivalled by our English Roscius  Mr BARRY's first outset in this sphere of life was in the part of Othello to the surprizing satisfaction and amazement of the general audience for sure never did young actor shew such judgment in the choice of his first part he seemed a finished Othello as Chetwood terms it dropt from the clouds which has ever since continued to be his favourite character and if we take a slight survey of Mr  Barry  's features  c  we need not wonder at his success in this part First the graces of manly beauty which are so favourably blended in his person secondly the prodigious flexibility and harmony of his voice which is so excellently adapted for the exhibition of Othello in short in this part and others I shall mention he is beyond critical exception For example where is his equal in Jaffier Romeo and Castalio he is not even surpassed by the mighty chief Mr  Garrick  though I am extremely partial to that gentleman's abilities yet justice obliges me to make this observation notwithstanding  there are many scenes in the two first parts in which Mr  Garrick  eminently excells but upon critical examination I believe it will be generally allowed through the whole course of those characters Mr  Barry  takes the lead though to draw any sort of parallel between those two gentlemen would be beyond my judgment and consequently presumptive therefore I shall content myself with only making mention of a circumstance of this sort and leave the rest for some more able critic to pursue As to Castalio I don't at this time recollect an instance of Mr  Garrick  's performing it Mr  Barry  's superiority over any other actor in the lover's part  c  must undoubtedly render him in this character matchless from his amorous harmony of features melting eyes and unequalled plaintiveness of voice which are requisites so peculiarly happy for forming the lover that it is no wonder Mr  Barry  should excell so far beyond any other performer in this province  I remember once to have seen this gentleman in Romeo particularly in the garden scene of this favourite play where Juliet appears at the window I thought he spoke the following lines incomparably fine with a syrenic sweetness of voice  See how she leans her cheek upon her hand  Oh that I were a glove upon that hand  That I might touch that cheek  And afterwards when Juliet replies "Ah me" then with what extacy he immediately spoke these words  She speaks she speaks  Oh speak again bright angel for thou art  As glorious to this sight being o'er my head  As is a winged messenger from Heaven  In the parting scene in the third act of this play I likewise thought him exceeding picturesque and affecting where he takes  leave of Juliet in a short sentence ending as follows  My life my love my soul adieu  He seemed to penetrate the foregoing line into the hearts of the most distant spectators but what I mostly admired in Mr  Barry  's performance of this part was the beginning of the tomb scene where Juliet wakes here a transport of joy love and tenderness flows within him with what acclamation and rapture he delivered this sentence  She speaks she lives and we shall still be bless'd  My kind p  opitious stars o'erpay me now  For all my sorrows pastrise rise my Juliet  And from this cave of death this house of horror  Quick let me snatch thee to thy Romeo's arms  The  e breathe a vital spirit in thy lips  And call thee back to life and love  There are many more beauties and excellencies I could remark in Mr  Barry  's performances in the pathetic and amorous but being too long for the limits of my design they would appear tedious all the imperfections I can discover about Mr  Barry  is in his action which is sometimes rather flat and unmeaning to the true sense of his words and likewise a stoop in his shoulders and a bend in his knees as if he was a  hamed of his superior stature as a critic observes and desirous to level it to the common standard but I forget that he is bordering on the vale of years consequently such blemishes as those must now be pardoned and forgiven  O Barry blest with person to excell  In vain my muse thy merit spares to tell  e  ne's boast the stage's second pride  The plaintive virtues in thy breast reside  Mr LEE  This established veteran from Ireland made his appearance this winter at Covent Garden in the part of Bayes in the Rehearsal though I was not so fortunate as to be present at this exhibition I cannot therefore pretend to be a competent judge of his merit in that part but by what I have seen of him since in Benedict Richard the third and Osman in Zara I think he has great abilities he has numberless beauties which are entirely his own as he appears to be free from imitation and built upon nature for his guide wherefore his performances shew themselves rather in a new dress but how far it may be requisite I will not presume to say though I must confess he gave pleasure to me yet might not to others In regard to this actor's figure I can't speak much in its praise I think him too corpulent and masculine  notwithstanding his features are expressive his voice articulate and powerful his action just and graceful and his deportment tolerable easy and refined and what is more observable free from that stiffness considering his part many actors are subject to these requisites joined to a true understanding of his merit must render Mr  Lee  a valuable addition to the above stage  When merit's great and action's just and true  The mind it will delight the heart subdue  Mr ROSS  This gentleman was formerly a great favourite with the public but is now upon the decline his person which used to be reckoned exceeding handsome and wellmade is grown fat and unwieldy his face too plump to shew off the distention or relaxation of the muscles in exhibiting the passions and his voice which was pleasing  and distinct is upon the break yet in his present state he is master of great powers and did he exert all of them oftener and endeavour to put as much action in his performance as he possibly can there are few of his cotemporaries could equal him in his walk  Give Ross his partridge give him too his claret  Mr Ross being passionately fond of what is here alluded to but rather to excess which I am apt to think is the cause of that mountain of flesh he is so much encumbered with    Ross will act wellbut better if you bar it  {inverted ⁂} This gentleman has left the London stage and is I believe performing at Edinburgh  Mr MACKLIN  The irreparable loss the stage has sustained since this gentleman has been discarded from it ought to be daily lamented by every  friend to the drama to see such excellent comic abilities lie buried in oblivion but I hope Mr  Macklin  by the exertion of his best friends will be enabled to overcome the illgrounded resentment of his enemies and be brought back to that seat of perfection he has so long filled with admiration and astonishment I shall not dwell upon this actor's merit but the reader is to observe that it is so very conspicuous as to bear the strictest scrutiny even from his adversaries though  Merit will sometimes fail of due regard  And virtue's self must be its own reward  Mr WOODWARD  What can I say of this gentleman whose very conspicuous abilities are so well known and admired in the sock by every frequenter of the theatre The public I believe need not be told that this veteran's  outset on the stage was at first as an harlequin he being articled to the late Mr Rich the celebrated harlequin and manager of Coventgarden theatre after being instructed in all the requisites of pantomime he acquired so extensive a knowledge of the sock that at the expiration of his term he was engaged by his pantomical master as a comedian at a very considerable salary and soon after acquired a firstrate reputation in his cast of parts Few are the walks of comedy Mr  Woodward  has not attempted and not any wherein he has not met with great and merited applause His figure is genteel his voice smart agreeable and pliant and both seem to point out the politer cast yet is somewhat odd that this actor never pleases his audience more than when he is necessitated from his characters to distort that genteel figure into the aukward deportment of a country looby or to swell his voice out of its natural tone into the hectoring accents of a bully or a blusterer and he never receives the first blow from any  of the drama on the stage with him but he generally returns it with double the force of his antagonist As a comedian I look upon Mr  Woodward  to be unequalled by any in his cast of parts such Bobadil Marplot Younger Wou'dbe Petrutio Apprentice Fine Gentleman in Lethe c c Besides he has supplied the stage with several well wrote prologues pantomimes c  Woodward for farce and pantomime renown'd▪  With wreaths of praise by ev'ry hand is crown'd  Mr SHUTER  The son of drollery and low humour owes almost every thing to nature education or art claim very little share in his success this is by some objected to as a desiciency in his profession yet it has been so sar useful to Mr  Shuter  that it has left him his natural parts free and uncorrupted by imitation and renders him an original actor He possesses  in an eminent degree a deal of humour though he is apt to screw the seatures of his face into deformity but never laughs at his own jest he has strong seatures and is exceeding happy in a peculiar turn of face which marks the respective characters he performs with great propriety and natural humour But he is always more comical  Ned Shuter  than any thing else  Shuter sweet laughter's child what humour's thine  From thee impetuous flows each comic line▪  Mr DYER  Mr DYER was a useful and pleasing comedian a good Modely in the Custom of the Manor a Clodio or a Tom in the Conscious Lovers a man amiable in his character just in his principles and of no inconsiderable share of merit in his profession such were the outlines of Mr  Dyer  till unfortunately  for the lovers of the theatre and his friends in general he paid the last debt of nature we all owe a few nights after performing Jeremy in Mr Congreve's celebrated comedy of Love for Love for his own benefit  ‡‡‡ I should have omitted Mr Dyer and Mr Love formerly of Drurylane theatre in my account but my motive is to acquaint the reader of all the principal performers deceased or living during the time I at first proposed  Dyer I weep for thy departed shade  For wept each Muse when thy last debt was paid  M LEWIS  This gentleman made his first appearance at Coventgarden theatre last winter in the part of Belcour in the West Indian in which he met with great applause He has since appeared in Sir George Airy in  the Busy Body Valentine in Love for Love and several other characters both in tragedy and comedy in the former he has performed Posthumus in Cymbeline the Prince of Wales in the first part of Henry the fourth c but I cannot admire him in the buskin his figure though exceeding genteel and well made wants consequence and his voice is inharmonious and defective Mr  Lewis  possesses great fire and spirit but he is apt to carry them too far and more especially in his comic characters which renders his performance almost unintelligible but I should not condemn young merit as the greatest actors ancient and modern have been obliged to time and attention for the cultivation of their talents therefore I think there is no doubt but Mr  Lewis  in the course of time may become a a very considerable performer  Lewis the space between a laugh and cry  Look in your mirror and for once descry  Then shall I give you all your merit's praise  Perhaps you'll shine in future better lays  Mr BENSLEY  Though as an actor I must confess Mr  Bensley  adds very little to this science yet from the cast of parts he is in possession of and the salary he is in receipt with somewhat entitles him to a place among the principal performers Though to enter critically upon this gentleman he has neither face voice manner or scarce any theatrical requisite his person to be looked at is tolerable but as soon as set in motion it becomes contemptible or at least as much intolerable there however is one principal requisite in this actor's favour which deserves notice that is his being generally more correct in his parts than the rest of his professors together with a willingness to please as he appears to study his parts with unremitted diligence and care which from a pretty good education and  his knowledge of the dramatic authors carries him through his cast of characters with a tolerable good grace I cannot quit this gentleman without doing him the justice to say that human nature never produced a more amiable character in private life  Bensley's no actor match him if ye can  Ye greatest actors he's a worthy man  Mr MATTOCKS  As an actor Mr  Mattocks  has very little title to public favour as a singer he claims very respectful notice his voice is clear soft melodious and expressive his person is tall and well made yet he wants the manly grace and vigour his sex demands and animation to inspirit the several characters he performs that his performance in the sock is rather flat and insipid as a vocal performer I look upon Mr  Mattocks  to be the best on either theatre in point of voice  and did he possess more compass he probably might be the best on any stage  To charm us Mattocks borrows from the spheres  His mien how sweet his voice delights our ears  Mr CLARKE  Mr CLARKE is a judicious and exceeding useful actor where he is confined to his own natural walk which is the rough honest parts of tragedy such as Henry the Eighth Sciolto in the Fair Penitent Clytus in Alexander the Great or Kent in King Lear  c  There is a manliness in his person with a sound and just tone of voice which renders him in this walk second to none on either of the stages  Does Clarke rough honesty in play present  No Clarke is really in his heart a Kent  Mr QUICK  Though I may be called to an account for introducing this promising Actor among the capital performers yet his merit in several parts of low comedy justly entitle him to a place here There is a variety in his performance with a peculiar turn of wit in his manner though a little bordering on grimace as he is too apt like a forementioned performer to screw the muscles of his face up into many very ridiculous forms which appears to be by way of imitating the former however Mr Quick has lately given sufficient proofs of his growing merit particularly in Tony Lumpkin in She Stoops to Conquer in which character I think he will bear a scrutiny from the nicest critic or connoisseur  Laugh'd into wit grimace from Quick shall rise  And quickly please our ears our hearts and eyes  Mrs BARRY  This Lady's established reputation with the town is too well known to require any further praise or censure than what ha been already said in my account of Mr Yates her unequalled abilities being so universally known and admired by every lover of the theatreHer majestic deportment elevated speech expressive manner and alacrity all pronounce her to be the most accomplished actress on the English perhaps on the European stage therefore I shall be brief and conclude this Lady with the following lines  O Barry when my muse but thinks on thee  She thinks of merit grace and tragedy  Mrs HARTLEY  This Lady made her first appearance on the stage in one of the county towns of  England but in what character or where for a certainty I will not presume to say however be this as it will it is now two seasons since she first appeared at CoventGarden theatre in the character of Jane Shore in which she was received with respectable marks of applause by a very brilliant audienceThis Lady is an exceeding good sigure in her person she is tall and elegant her face is likewise remarkably handsome and her whole deportment genteel and easy in short she is the finest figure on the London stage therefore it is not to be wondered a lady endued with such requisites for this profession should gain great applause had she absolutely little or no merit But this is not Mrs  Hartley  's case her excellent performance of the above and many other parts she has since appeared in has fully convinced us to the contrary Her performance of Elfrida Statira and Rosamond in Mr Hull's new play of King Henry the Second I believe has given the public incontestable proofs of her  rising genius The only fault I can discover in this Lady is her voice is somewhat harsh and she is sometimes apt to wind it beyond the bounds of harmony did Mrs  Hartley  take a little more pains in modulating her accents it would add greatly to her praise But as the poet remarks  If to her share some female errors fall  Look in her face and you'll forgive them all  Mrs MATTOCKS  This useful and pleasing actress is a child of the stage her father and mother being both of that profession at the time of her birth her first outset was in the singing parts with no inconsiderable share of applause but it was not singing alone constructed this Lady's abilities it was her desirous and successful attempts in the lively spirited parts of comedy in which she succeeded  to her wishes and now stands foremost among the favourite daughters of Thalia she has since appeared in tragedy with all the success the diminutive size of her figure will permit and indeed she is above mediocrity in any part she has performed in the latter This actress likewise possesses in all her various characters a prodigious fund of sensibility and is mostly persect in the true sense and spirit of her author that take all in all a pleasing person an agreeable voice and a good share of judgment renders her one of the most useful performers belonging to CoventGarden theatre  Thalia and Melpomene combin'd  To shew in Mattocks all their sorce refin'd  Miss MACKLIN  Miss MACKLIN like the above Lady is a child of the stage her father is the forementioned excluded and celebrated comedian  Mr Charles MacklinThis Lady like Mrs  Mattocks  came out in the singing characters in which her elegant figure and profound taste in music gained her considerable applause From this like the aforesaid Lady she stept forth into the walks of comedy and tragedy where she has shone for several years past with the public's unlimited approbation but her talents are mostly inclined to the former as she seldom appears in the latter her parts being but few and are generally confined to the tender cast though did she appear oftner in tragedy it probably might be more entertaining to the public and I don't see why she should not as it would be the means of credibly restoring many parts tha are now lost to CoventGarden stage  Euterpe's darling child in Macklin see  And call her child of sweetest melody  Mrs BULKLEY  This Lady's first outset in lise was as a dancer at CoventGarden a science Mrs  Bulkley  is most passionately fond of and which I am given to understand she pursued more for pleasure than advantage to herself however dancing like singing to Mrs Mattocks and Miss Macklin was discovered to be not her only merit in consequence of which through the ardent persuasions of some friends she condescended to try what she could do in the sock and buskin in which she has undoubtedly answered the expectation of those who solicited her▪to pursue this undertaking but I think the sock seems to sit much easier on this Lady than the buskin  The reader is to observe that those terms Sock and Buskin so often made use of in this work denote Comedy and Tragedy as Sock for Comedy and Buskin for Tragedy theatrical phrases  there is an agreeableness  in her address that appears to be best adapted to comedy though I have seen her with deserved success in several parts of tragedy yet here I think she sometimes wants expression and variation in her features and voice However we may rate Mrs  Bulkley  from the delicacy of her person and her judgment a very agreeable useful and judicious Actress  Terpsechore to Bulkley gave the part  By graceful motion to attract the heart  Mrs GREEN  This Actress like Miss Pope of DruryLane theatre may in some measure be deemed as a copy of Mrs Clive but of the two the last mentioned lady gains the preference in this point there is a greater variety in Miss Pope than in Mrs  Green  or in the theatrical term of expressing it more of the viscomica which so much abounded  in their great predecessor Mrs  Green  's chief abilities lie in Chambermaids where her humour and prodigious flow of spirits are best suited It is observed by a celebrated critic that it is a sort of misfortune for this Actress that we have not yet adopted in England the French custom of making important characters of Chambermaids she being possessed of all those requisites necessary to excell in that province where her great humour smart repartee lively voice and agreeable pertness would be most fortunately placed She is somewhat too affected in her manner though it would be essentially meritable in the above but in her present cast of characters I think it rather a defect nevertheless we must set down Mrs  Green  a very considerable and valuable Actress in her walk  Gay comedy to Green descends in smiles  And wins applause thro' all her little wiles  Miss MILLER  Miss MILLER without doubt has merit in many parts of tragedy such as Roxana Alicia Juliet Cordelia  c  and in comedy she is useful in the few parts she performs but she appears so seldom in the sock that it is almost needless for me to mention this The faults of this Lady generally lie in a want of expression and in her voice which is not exactly tunable and wants compass and could she break herself of that stiffness in her gait it would add no small share towards her preferment though this defect may be overlooked in her performance of the haughty Roxana and Alicia yet let me tell Miss  Miller  it does her great prejudice in personating the tender parts of tragedy which she is in possession of such as Juliet Cordelia  c  by reason it prevents her from giving that soft  and tender expression which is so much required in those parts but  Who can the sweetly plaintive Miller hear  And not emit the sympathetic tear  {inverted ⁂} Miss Miller at present is disengaged from CoventGarden occasioned by the late alteration at that theatre  Miss BARSANTI  This lady made her first appearance at CoventGarden theatre in a new interlude wrote for that purpose by the late acting managerMiss  Barsanti  is a promising young Actress since her commencement she has appeared in several parts of polite comedy with universal applause particularly in Estefania in Rule a Wife and have a Wife Mrs Oakley in the Jealous Wife Charlotte Rusport in the West Indian  c  She is a smart handsome figure and not much unlike in stature the favourite Mrs  Abington and I hear she has fixed upon this lady as a model if so I don't know a better to copy only I would have her take care that this lady's mode of dressing her characters does not lead her into errors as what would be allowable in Mrs Abington from her exterior manner in conducting herself might be prejudicial to Miss  Barsanti  however on the whole I would have this young lady beware of imitation as it sometimes proves many a promising young actor's or actress's ruin by making their performance contemptible and ridiculous though  In Miss Barsanti each improving grace  Glows rip'ning from her bosom to her face  Miss CATLEY  As an actress this lady has little pretention to be spoke of as a singer she is at present the sweetest warbler on the English  stage Her voice is strong clear harmonious and expressive notwithstanding these musical requisites through a careless inexcusable negligence she sings with great impropriety that often renders her vocal performance disgusting I mention this as it is in her power would she take a little more pains to remedy it She likewise throws into her parts many indecent and vulgar attitudes which is still worse than the former for as the poet observes  Immodest deeds admit of no defence  For want of decency is want of sense  In the part of Juno in the Burletta of the Golden Pippin Miss  Catley  is exceeding low and immodest but why need I mention all this of a lady whose private character is too much connected with such behaviour and I am almost led to imagine the author of the Pippin has drawn his character of Juno from nature there being such a resemblance between the part and the perform  er's private and public conduct that I scarce think but it was so But not to tire the reader's patience with too long a preamble on a subject of this kind so many anecdotes c having been published concerning this lady it will be useless besides unbecoming to dwell here upon Miss  Catley's  private character as such I shall conclude this celebrated lady and refer such of my curious readers as chuse to trace the various incidents of her past life to her memoirs where they will find them more extensively authenticated and justly adhered to  The sportive loves without the least disguise  Appear unsham'd in Catley's wanton eyes  The CONCLUSION  Having given an account of all the principal actors and actresses that have appeared on the stage for upwards of two years back I shall now favour the reader with some remarks on the inferior performers  such as are not destitute of merit although annot be deemed as capitals the first of those gentry stands Mr Lee Lewes this person is a thriving and pleasing comedian there is a smartness in his manner that must one time render him considerable The next are Mr J A  ckin and Mr Wroughton two respectable performers where nothing great is wanting the first much superior to the latter in critical estimation being a just and decent performer the other is too much guilty of mouthing as Shakespeare terms it and is not totally engaging in his manner and wants expression c Mr Dunstall is a good low comedian but like the preceding gentleman too much of a mouther notwithstanding his Hodge and Sir Jealous Traffick are inimitable such characters being happily suited to his manner Mr Jefferson and Mr Packer are useful men the first considerably the be  t in tragedy and pretty equal in comedy though both bordering on the palm of insipidityMr Hull is a gentleman who understands  his author and the drama exceeding well is very capable of supporting paternal characters but for want of powers in other views he is no ways important as an actor though a very chaste and respectable dramatic writer Mr Clinch and Mr Diamond these two gentlemen started the same season at Drurylane theatre  i e  in October the one in Alexander the Great the other in Romeo Mr Clinch has since proved to be a Clinch for he clinches so vociferously that if he is not less violent he will inevitably tear himself and his parts to rags therefore I would advise him not to be so lavish with his superfluous fire and action as by observing this observation he would bustle through his cast of characters with much more decency and applause than he usually does Mr Diamond displayed on his first appearance very conspicuous merit in some scenes of Romeo in others he was totally insufficient in judgment voice and expression particularly in the frantic scenes but on the whole he supported  that character considering his age which was then but nineteen with tolerable ease and propriety Mr Diamond has left Drurylane but in what quarter of the globe he is at present I will not presume to fay Mr Lacy this gentleman made his appearance last winter in Alexander but not meeting in his attempt with so much public indulgence as was literally expected he has I believe cordially relinquished all thoughts of any future trial on the stage Mr Melmoth this ingenious person came out last benefit time in the part of Cyrus which character he went through with candid applause he has since played Hamlet and is far from being contemptible in it having a very good knowledge of his author and a just conception of the part and with a little cultivation of his talents he may be enabled to make no inconsiderable stand as a tragedian Mess Bannister Reinhold and DuBellamy nothing of speakers but well esteemed singers the  two first have excellent base voices the last an inimitable counter though greatly injured by a defective ear to music There are many more I could thrust into my account such as Mr Waldron Mr Young Mr Booth Mr Brereton c c but are not worthy our attention as such I shall proceed to the ladies in this circle of action among which stands foremost Mrs Pitt this is a truly great actress in her walk which is in the parts of superannuated old maids without her equal on the stage The next stands Mrs Lessingham and Mrs Melmoth the former is very agreeable in some parts of comedy but wretchedly horrible in tragedy being destitute of voice manner expression and in short almost every requisite the latter has not yet attempted comedy but has continued since her first appearance in Calista in the Fair Penitent to be very respectable in several parts of tragedy and seems to be a promising lady Mrs Greville and Miss Jarratt two very pretty women and thriving acresses  Mrs Greville has very pleasing comic abilities▪ as witness her Irish widow and many other characters of that cast and were s  e to attempt tragedy I am apt to think she would be equally applauded having seen her in the country in several capital parts with great succcess particularly Monimia in the Orphan Juliet Imogen c c Miss Jarratt is so very agreable in all she undertakes and gives such repeated prooss of her growing merit that it is neeedless for me to say more on the subject than by adding that she is a pretty decent and promising actress The following ladies are Mrs Baker Mrs Wrighten Miss Brown and Miss Wylde which are all useful pleasing and judicious performers in their respective characters After saying thus much I shall conlude  Th' affects and defects of each actor I've stated  And not one have I under or overrated  Ye critics ceny if you can what's related  STRICTURES On the much admired TRAGEDY of the ORPHAN  In a LETTER to a Young LADY  Dear Miss  I TAKE this opportunity to fulfil your request as it is unbounded happiness to me at all times to devote myself to your service but I am excessive bad at compliments I therefore shall leave these to novelists c and proceed to the subject of the play which is a very affecting circumstance The story on which this tragedy is founded is that of Iphigenia which is wrought up with such masterly elocution by Mr Otway the author that those auditors who are not excited at the representation  of this play must be void of common feeling and more especially when a Barry appears in Castalio or a Mrs Barry in Monimia or the excellent performance of a Garrick in Chamont which I remember to have seen and when thus supported by three such inimitable ornaments together with the enraptured stile of the author who then I say but the dullest unfeeling auditor but what must be excited at such an exhibition for who can behold the distressful situations of Castalio and the injured Monimia without sharing in their afflictionThe first scene in this play that should raise our passions is in the second act where Monimia upbraids Castalio for his leaving her alone to the intreaties of his brother Polidore which he like an equivocating friend does in order to calm his brother's rage seeing the ardour of his passion for her and not willing to offend him imagining at the same time all Polidore's solicitations to Monimia would be in vain being sensible Monimia's affections were entirely to himself  Therefore what auditor would not be affected at Castalio's griefs when the object of his heart upbraids him and vows never to listen to him more What distress the poor crying Castalio appears to be in when he speaks the following sentence to her  Who can hear this and bear an equal mind  Since you will drive me from you I must go  But Oh Monimia when thou hast banished me▪  No creeping slave though tractable and dull  As artful woman for her end would chuse  Shall ever dote as I have done for Oh  No tongue my pleasure nor my pains can tell  Tis Heav'n to have thee and without thee Hell  Then after he has spoken the foregoing sentence when his beloved Monimia is so charmed with the music of his tongue that she forgives and pities him Then what extatic joy flows immediate within him with what rapture does the following speech come from his mouth But never  more so than when it is delivered by the sweet melodious and expressive voice and manner of a Barry  Where am I surely paradise is round me  Sweets planted by the hand of Heav'n grow here  And ev'ry sense is full of thy perfection  To hear thee speak might calm a madman's frenzy  Till by attention he forgot his sorrows  But to behold thy eyes the amazing beauties  Might make him rage again with love as I do  To touch thee's Heaven but to enjoy thee Oh  Thou nature's whole perfection in one piece  Sure framing thee Heav'n took unusual care  As it's own beauty it design'd thee fair  And form'd thee by the best lov'd Angel there  The next and most affecting circumstance in this play is in the third act after Castalio's marriage with Monimia when they confer together concerning enjoying at night their nuptial happiness  which after some intreaty Monimia condescends when  all the family are at rest to let him into her chamber when he Castalio by order of Monimia is to make a certain signal  which is three soft taps at the chamberdoor    at which he is to gain admittance but alas unhappily his brother Polidore listens and overhears the whole tenor of their appointment therefore not knowing of their marriage Polidore is much chagrined at the thoughts of Castalio's happiness he was going to reap with the fair Monimia In consequence he contrives a plot to enjoy her if possible himself accordingly he gets his little page Cordelia to go and trifle with Castalio in order to delay the time in the mean while he counterfeits his brother and with the aforesaid signal gains entrance and enjoys Monimia she at the same time mistaking him for her lord CastalioUnfortunately the poor fond adorer comes according to his appointment made glowing with rapture at the thoughts of his blissful night to come with his dear Monimia but unhappily  he is refused admittance by the maid servant being conscious as she thought she let Castalio in before and imagining the real husband to be the counterfeit Polidore Who can behold such a scene as this without sharing in the distresses of Castalio and more especially when he lay down at the door almost distracted thinking it is Monimia's cruelty that has used him thus  In the fourth act we see Castalio upbraid Monimia in the most fervent manner possible for her severe treatment as he supposed which she is greatly surprised at and well she may be when at the sight of him she flies with energy to his arms imagining how happy she was in his embraces the preceding night at the same time as I have observed it was the profligate Polidore What should most excite our feeling in this act is to see the injured Monimia dragged like a dog by her beloved Castalio to the door when he cruelly breaks from  her with all the fierceness of a fiend and afterwards when she acquaints her brother Chamont of the severe and unexpected treatment which she has received from her lord at which how chagrined and exasperated is Chamont for the injury done to his sister and vows vengeance on Castalio with what exclamation he speaks the following lines to old Acasto Castalio's father  I say my sister's wrong'd  Monimia my sister born as high  And noble as Castaliodo her justice  Or by the Gods I'll lay a scene of blood  Shall make this dwelling horrible to nature  I'll do'thark you my lord your son Castalio  Take him to your closet and there teach him manners  With what unbounded excellence Mr Garrick speaks the above sentence what contempt he shews when he utters the last two lines that so elegantly discovers how much he is displeased at the cruel usage done  to Monimia that in short this last scene is exceeding natural and affectingThe last act at the rising of the curtain discovers the unhappy Castalio lying on the ground in a state of lunacy cursing Monimia and all the inconstant sex of women till a servant enters and acquaints him how wild and intemperate Monimia is for to behold her lord at which he relinquishes all of a sudden into love and tenderness for her  Soon after Monimia enters and after some conference together she tells him  She is resolved from that day never more to see his face again    in what distressful accents he immediately after speaks this sentence  Where am I sure I wander 'midst enchantment  And never more shall find the way to rest  But Oh Monimia art thou indeed resolv'd  To punish me with everlasting absence  Why turn'st thou from me I am alone already  Methinks I stand upon a naked beach  Sighing to winds and to the seas complaining  Whilst afar off the vessel s  ils away  Where all the treasure of my soul's embark'd  Wilt thou not turnOh could those eyes but speak  I should know all for love is pregnant in 'em  They swell they press their beams upon me still  Wilt thou not speak if we must part for ever  Give me but one kind word to think upon  And please myself withal whilst my heart's breaking  Mrs Barry the original Monimia I am told always shed tears at this beautiful or rather bewitching passage as it may properly be so called and afterwards when she replied and exits "Ah poor Castalio" I have heard in speaking these three words she has been so much affected seeing at that instant the distressed situation Castalio appeared to be in that it was always some  time before she rightly could recover herself and dull must be the apprehension of the auditor that is not affected with such a scene notwithstanding what we see is only feigned to us yet in all probability the story from whence the origin of this tragedy was founded was true wherefore such an instance represented should most certainly excite our feelings But to proceed the catastrophe of this play is very judiciously wound up by the author and abounds with a variety of incidents for here we see the fall of Monimia Castalio and Polidore and Chamont vowing destruction on Acasto and all his house for the injury done his sister The conclusion is prodigiously affecting though our pity should only be reserved for the good old father Acasto the injured Monimia and the poor unfortunate son Castalio as the fall of Polidore should not in the least affect us he being nothing more than a mere proselyte of viceThe author of this play I believe it will be generally allowed by all  impartial judges wrote more immediately to the heart in painting the tender passions than any of his predecessors or in short any of his cotemporaries excepting Rowe' who in his productions comes the nearest to Otway of any other dramatic author either ancient or modern particularly in his favourite tragedy of the Fair Penitent where all the characters in this play are supported with so much judgment and the language so extremely elegant as is the Orphan that by the great resemblance there is in the style of these two plays we might almost imagine them to be the production of one man though it must be confessed Rowe in his dialogues is more chaste and praise worthy than Otway for the latter is in many instances indecent and deficient of moral tendency which the former strictly confined himself to for example in the Orphan Polidore's allusion of the bull is contemptible and absurd in the highest degree and in the little page's character there are many indecencies especially  for a child to speak it being mostly performed by one but we must impute them to the licentiousness of the age he wrote in But I may as well drop the curtain as Cibber says at the same time hoping to have your opinion as soon as convenient on the little matter I have here sent you and with humble submission  I remain  Dear Miss  Your ever devoted and respectful Servant H▪  STRICTURES On the favourite TRAGEDY of the FAIR PENITENT In a LETTER to the same  LETTER THE SECOND  Dear Mifs  BEING ever as I told you in my last devoted to your service I therefore in compliance with your request a second time and in order to fulfil my promise have sent you a few thoughts on the  Fair Penitent  accordinglyThe subject of this play is an excellent moral it shews in an eminent degree the dangerous consequence of parents forcing their children into marriage against their own inclinations and  paints nature in a very conspicuous manner Mr Wilkes in his general review of the stage remarks on this tragedy that there is not one character in the whole play deserves compassion yet I must confess I am of a different opinion and he further observes the heroine of this play has no manner of right to the above title  that gentleman says  her grief does not spring from compunction but from a variety of passions which she is prevented from gratifying  probably he would have the play termed "The Penitent Prostitute" which I think is far too gross a title notwithstanding she yields to Lothario before her marriage with Altamont In my poor opinion I think her rather to be pitied as many of her sex that would be strictly virtuous are liable to the same failing in the heat of blood as I please thus vulgarly to term it and especially with a man she sincerely loved Is not Sciolto her father in the wrong when he knows she loves Lothario to force her into marriage with another  man whom she has not the least veneration for though her husband is passionately doating of her what is this▪ to the purpose when it is quite the reverse with Calista for if both hearts do not mutually agree in the conjugal state how is it possible the parties can be happy How many like Calista have been deluded by the soothing tales of the male sex and by their proffering marriage as Lothario did to Calista and afterwards deceived them To be sure Lothario is a rakish young gentleman and like many more of the present age when he has gained his ends in enjoying the fair flame he afterwards has no further regard as Foote says "When they are gratified then they are satisfied"  Therefore dear Miss though my own sex be cautious how you listen to their alluring enticements for it is exceeding preearious trusting men there being so many seducers that your sex cannot have too great a guard over themselves and they  have so many wheedling and trepanning ways to decoy poor harmless and unthinking maids by telling them as Mackheath says a hundred things which they never mean to perform things that your sex are apt to put too much confidence in through which means they sometimes render themselves a common prey to their lewd and abandoned desires and then inevitable ruin consequently ensues and at the same time they not only reflect dishonour upon themselves but likewise bring much trouble and affliction on their aged parents that have taken great care and diligence in bringing them up to an age of discretion and in hopes of seeing them tread in the paths of virtue▪ instead of that they too too often fall a sacrifice to their spotless virginity like the heroine of the foregoing play by building their hopes on such a sandy foundation as perfidious men as such they become the scoff and ridicule of all their former acquaintance and are despised by those who before were their most ardent friends I  could dwell with energy much longer on this subject but being rather obliged to proceed with the few remarks I have to make on the play it will be inconsistent and intruding on your patience but before I proceed I must beg to be excused for the little I have said on the above topic as my motive for interspersing this matter is entirely for the love of your future welfare▪ as such and for no other reason was it wrote But to the play Though does not Calista after her marriage with Altamont reject all Lothario's offers with the utmost contempt when he wants to enjoy her a second time with those words  How didst thou dare to think that I would live  A slave to base desires and brutal pleasures  To be a wretched wanton for thy leisures  To toy and waste an hour of idle time with  My soul disdains thee for so mean a thought  In short I think her all through the play an object fully deserving pity As for the poor fond and gentle Altamont I likewise pity his case much although the ill usage he treats his friend Horatio with for it is naturally to be supposed he would put more confidence in the story the object of his heart related than that which his friend told him and especially at a time he believes her spotless How often do we see a circumstance of this kind among the lower class of people a man and his wife shall quarrel or what not a friend comes and interferes in behalf of the parties then afterwards gets most infamously abused for his civility As for Sciolto the father claims scarce any compassion as he may partly thank himself for all the sorrow and shame he has brought on his old age and I sincerely wish that every parent whom providence has endued with a family of children would take warning by Sciolto's misconduct  and not force them into marriage against their own consent but as sir Jealous Traffic in the Busy Body says  By my example let all parents move  And never strive to cross their children's love  They should submit that care to providence above  PASTORAL SONGS EPITAPHS c  The  FORSAKEN MAID  A  CANTATA  written at thirteen Years old  RECITATIVE

comfort of my heart  The sweets of am'rous folly  Yet my muse forbear awhile  Nor call it am'rous folly  For I ne'er can nor will beguile  The charms of pretty Polly  Her milkwhite breasts and sparkling eyes  Did first inflame my mind  And her ambrosial charms that lies  So beauteous and so kind  Amorous bliss is our delight  In Venus sportive bower  Sequester'd there we lay all night  And pluck the vernal flower  ELEGY  Written at Colchester  Addressed to Miss Kn  I  I Asked the muse that rules the sounding lyre  To wreathe my temples with one sprig of bays  Some lofty subject to my soul inspire  Some lofty subject in heroic lays  II  But Venus came the soft enchanting fair  I saw her glancing from her native sky  Loose flow'd her shining tresses in the air  And love's own lustre trembled from her eye  III  She bade me chuse a less ambitious strain  And shew'd the image of a smiling maid  Let Delia's praises echo to the plain  To ev'ry murm'ring stream and ev'ry shade  IV  O ruthless goddess am I doom'd to bow  Again to love's soft empire and to thee  Wilt thou no respite to my pangs allow  No destin'd moment must this heart be free  V  Yet not for this I past the sounding main  Yet not for this I sought a distant shore  Thy captive then exulting lest his chain  And scorn'd that powr' which men and gods adore  VI  But well thou hast aveng'd thy slighted pride

unprest by human feet  I sung unheeded to the pale moon's gleam  Thee Delia thee the echoing gales repeat  VIII  Come then too fatal and too lovely fair  Come seek these groves and ease a wretch's toil  One look from thee can mitigate despair  And bid all nature and thy lover smile  IX  Nor thou despise the shepherd's artless tale  He leads fair Truth and Innocence along  Because she sings in some sequester'd vale  Are there no charms in Philomela's song  X  O might thy lover hope to win thy praise  His soul should kindle with a nobler flame  This hand should seize the bloodbesprinkl'd bays  Which conquest snatches from the shrines of same  XI  Place me where raging slaughter's crimson wheels  O'er gasping ranks of bleeding warriors roar  And if my soul one thought of danger feels  O never Delia may I see thee more  XII  Nor deem because I loiter in the shade  I bear a breast unequal in the deed  I hear the blasts of terror undismay'd  Tho' pleas'd I listen to the rural reed

cares distract my soul  Joyless the laurel wreaths of fame I see  And vain her animating thunders roll  If with her blasts she mix no notes of thee  XV  Then listen Delia to a swain undone  Ah hear a slave condemn'd thy chains to wear  So may thy days in peace glide gently on  Unmixt with grief unsullied with a tear  XVI  For ah in vain thy gentle tear would flow  To see thy lover press an early tomb  Then let thy pity mitigate his woe  'Ere sickness wither and despair consume  XVII  Wretch that I am ah rather let me bind  Hope's dear delusive chaplet to my brows  Let fancy paint thee to my wonnded mind  All fweetly smiling on thy lover's vows  XVIII  O how I long by arching shades o'erhung  Where breezes sport and fountains murmer bland  To hear the tuneful accents of thy tongue  To press the glowing softness of thy hand  XIX  O how I long to lead thee to the bowers  Where Flora scatters all her thousand dies  To braid thy glossy hair with dewy flowers  And catch the mild effulgence of thy eyes  XX  Thus with ideal bliss I fondly try  Beneath the woodbine shade to soothe my pains  But ah too soon the lovely phantoms fly  And stern reality alone remains  XXI  She bursts with thunders arm'd upon my dreams  She tears me struggling from the woodbine shade  She points to other groves and other streams  But ah she points me to no Heav'nly maid  XXII  I come the mournful

balmy sleep  And banish ev'ry care  Into my mind thy beauties creep  My sweet angelic fair  II  Then straight they drive each languid joy  There wound each quiet thought  My heart's the seat of beauty's boy  With all his armour fraught  III  Believe me Betsy lovely fair  Believe thy captive swain  Thy charms alone engross my care  Alone can give me pain  IV  When round my neck with winning grace  Thy snowy arms are thrown  By Heav'n the dear the kind embrace  Bears all my reason down  V  Gods when from thy vermilion lips  Where all the graces meet  Reclin'd upon thy breast I sip  Ambrosial Heav'nly sweets  VI  What fancy can conceive the bliss  What lauguage can express  Th' extatic joy the rapt'rous bliss  The glowing warm caress  Verses  addressed to  Mrs GREVILLE  for the

in your breast  Nought but goodnature gentility and ease  In short your company is sure to please  Whether thou art amongst the rich and great  Or whether 'mongst those of an humbler state  In these extremes thou justly art admir'd  But ah my seeble muse at length grows tir'd  For she a sluggish jade with all her arts  Can never paint nor celebrate thy parts  Thy virtues are extravagantly great  Beyond a pen like mine for to relate  And of the gift I didst on thee bestow  May in your breast each moral sentence glow  And while you read may you the wiser grow  Thus I take leave and let the curtain drop  My muse has left me so of course must stop  A  Prologue  intended to be spoken on the  Author's  first appearance on the Stage in the Character of  George Barnwell  BEfore this awful court tonight appears  A youth of tragic parts yet full of fears  Bashful and young he ventures on the stage  Hoping your kind attention to engage  Barnwell's the theme wherein he means to shew  That youth's misfortunes and excessive woe  By which he hopes to draw a tender tear  From you kind auditors that's fitting here  But ah he fears that some stern wag will say  "That stripling sure can never Barnwell play  "He has not courage wants a bolder face  "To act young Barnwell with a decent grace"  But soft  pauses  I think he told me if I'm right  He dreamt a dream most wonderful last night  He thought that he was acting on the stage  And in an instant burst into a rage  On hearing of a critic in the pit  Exclaim against him with his nauseous wit  But presently he thought he was appeas'd  By
