 A COMPARATIVE STATEMENT OF THE TWO BILLS FOR THE BETTER GOVERNMENT OF THE BRITISH POSSESSIONS IN INDIA BROUGHT INTO PARLIAMENT BY MR FOX AND MR PITT WITH EXPLANATORY OBSERVATIONS  BY R B SHERIDAN ESQ  DUBLIN  PRINTED BY P BYRNE No GRAFTONSTREET MDCCLXXXVIII  To J  M  ESQ **** **** Staffordshire  DEAR SIR  YOU request from me with infinitely more importunity than the thing is worth a copy of the short comparison between Mr Fox's India Bill and Mr Pitt's which I read in my place in the House of Commons in the last day's debate upon the Declaratory Act I now send it to you with a number of notes or observations which I have been induced to add to it from a desire of complying more fully with what I conceive to be your object in asking for the paper I have been led into more length than I intended on the subject and this must be my apology for not having obeyed your commands sooner  You will perceive however that I have not in these remarks paid your judgment so ill a compliment as to have endeavoured to engage your attention by laboured arguments  still less by any attempt at ornament I have endeavoured merely to be intelligible and to confine the illustrations I adopt to facts If upon the whole you should be of opinion that these papers contain a fair statement of the true meaning of the two Bills and some just comments upon that meaning they are at your disposal to be put into any person's hands you please or to be given to the public if it is thought worth while to do so  The comparison itself I wrote in the House of Commons during the debate from feeling it I confess a teazing circumstance to hear gentlemen of the most respectable abilities day after day arguing upon and drawing parallels between the provisions of the two Bills upon which it was perfectly obvious they had not condescended to bestow any very minute degree of attention and conceiving it to be no very difficult task to reduce the discussion to a plain and concise statement of fact With regard to Mr Fox's Bill I do venture peremptorily to assert that there never was a legislative measure so little examined so generally misunderstood and so confidently misrepresented  You acknowledge yourself to be one of those who have been in some degree of error on the subject and you confess that you now begin to see the measure itself as well as the conduct of those who opposed it in a  new point of view and that you meet with many who confess the same Nay some even of those who were formerly most violent on this topic have in your hearing acknowledged you say and you seem to expect me to triumph in the intelligence that "Mr Pitt's Bill is very like if not quite as bad as Mr Fox's"You will forgive my saying however that this is a compromise which we never shall accept even as the overture of returning confidence from those whose good opinion we most regretted to lose In fact there is no resemblance between the two Bills in any circumstance excepting only the little ceremony with which they both treated the Charter of the Company nor could any person who supported Mr Fox's Bill and still approves the measure give his countenance to Mr Pitt's with the smallest degree of consistencyBut examine the subject fairly yourself upon the plain ground of factI will not attempt to bias your opinion by any previous argument  You will receive with this a copy of the other Bill brought in by Mr Fox which you say you never saw intitled "A Bill for the better Government of the Territorial Possessions and Dependencies in India" This Bill accompanied what is usually called "  Mr Fox's India Bill  " but is seldom mentioned altho' it formed a very essential part of the plan and the consideration of it is  extremely necessary to the understanding the principle and main object of the system  I send you also a copy of Mr Pitt's Bill as it came out of the Committee when it was reprinted with its alterations and amendments In looking it over I do not desire you to take notice of the ludicrous manner in which it is pieced and patched and corrected and altered almost from the beginning to the end merely to convince you of the sad slovenly style in which the act was framed but in order that you may compare the spirit and obvious purpose of some of these alterations with the text as it first stood by doing which you will be much better enabled to judge of the true meaning of the original Act than by any thing you can learn from the Declaratory Law  As to the Declaratory Law itself and the plea which was made for itwe seem to be perfectly agreed upon that subject The papers laid before the House of Commons certainly contain as you observe a complete refutation of all the pretences upon which the sending out the four regiments to India was defended as  a measure of necessity  And still more strongly do I agree with you in your remarks upon  Declaratory Acts  in general and upon the nature of this Declaratory Act in particular It is indeed an alarming and an unfortunate event in the History of Parliament  for it is one that shakes the foundation of that security which all men hope from Law and of that respect which all men owe to itto see the Representatives of the people persuaded to intercept the ordinary course of justice to assume themselves a judicial character and upon the suggestion of the King's Ministers to determine a question of property in favour of the servants of the Crown against the claims of the subject  Nor can our apprehensions of the consequences of this precedent be diminished by reflecting upon the manner in which the measure was carried thro' the House of Lords by reflecting that the supreme court of judicature in this country should have been induced by any influence or by any eloquence or upon any plea of necessity pretended or real to decidewith unparalleled precipitationupon a construction of lawin the absence of the Judges of the land and without granting a hearing to the parties interested in their decision  Yet possibly you will be surprised when I add that it is  because  I perfectly and cordially agree with you in your observations upon these proceedings that I do not so readily adopt the conclusion you have drawn with regard to the advantage which "the exparty" I use your own phrase is supposed to have obtained in consequence of the weak conduct of the Administration in this business  If this partywhose general principles fidelity of attachment and openness of conduct you own you respectbut own it with the splenetic reluctance of one who has been in vain endeavouring to look for system uninion or plain dealing elsewhereIf this party had no other object but to retort popular invectives to detect the sinister views of political adversaries to lessen the confidence of Parliament in their measures or to shake the opinion of their consequence in another quarter there undoubtedly was cause for considerable triumph in the late eventsand of still fairer triumph perhaps in the opportunity afforded of vindicating their own characters under circumstances of great advantage and upon grounds the most embarrassing to their opponents But understanding as I trust I do the terms and conditions upon which alone that party will ever seek to obtain or consent to hold ministerial situations in this country I never shall admit that their cause can be essentially advanced by any legislative measure which tends to lower the House of Commons in the public estimation and to deprive Parliament of the respect and confidence of the country  Upon such occasions whatever advantage this or that set of men may gain in debate or in public opinion  Their  's only is the triumph who love not the popular part of our Constitution whose credit and whose principles  prosper in the abasement of all popular character and who would at any time be content to participate in the reproach of an odious measure provided it reflected superior disgrace on Parliament as the instrument of effecting itBut I am getting upon ground which may lead us from the subject I wish to press to your more immediate attentionI shall therefore only add that I am  With great truth and regard Your sincere And obedient servant RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN  Brutonstreet  March th  COPY of a PAPER read by Mr Sheridan in the HOUSE OF COMMONS on  Friday  the th Day of March  THE PROFESSED OBJECT of the Two Bills for the better Government of the British Possessions in India brought into Parliament the one by Mr FOX in and the other by Mr PITT in was to relieve the Natives of that Country from the many evils which they had experienced under the Dominion of or in consequence of their Connection with the Government of the Company of the United Merchants trading to the EastIndies It was assumed by the Framers of both Bills that this Relief was not to be expected from the Government of the Company constituted as it then was and it was admitted by both that the Patronage and Influence of the Company ought not to be transferred to the Crown  A  MR FOX's BILL "  discontinued  " the powers and authorities of the  Company for the term of four years and transferred those powers and no more or others for the said term to seven Directors named by Parliament to be by them exercised "in  trust  for and for  the benefit of the said Company  "  B  Mr Fox's Bill did not affect to separate the right of nominating and appointing the persons to be entrusted and employed in executing the measures of Government in India from the right of originating and directing the measures themselves  C  Mr Fox's Bill did not pretend at once to divide the commercial from the political interests or the trade from the revenues of the Company and did therefore provide that nine "Assistant Directors" nominated by Parliament "from among the Proprietors of East India Stock" should form "a Board for the sole purpose of ordering and managing the commerce of the said united Company" under and subject to the orders and directions of the said Superior Board  D  Mr Fox's Bill did not pretend to be founded in any respect upon the consent of the Company nor to produce a system of reform agreeable to or concerted with those whose abuse of power it professed to remedy  E  Mr Fox's Bill established no  fourth estate  nor gave any one power to the Directors therein named which did not before exist in the Company but on the contrary did limit and restrain the said Directors so appointed by Parliament in various particulars in which the Company's Directors were not before restrained  F  Mr Fox's Bill so far from placing the Directors named by Parliament above the executive Government of the Country and out of the reach of its inspection and controul did expresly  and distinctly place them under the same obligation to communicate their transactions to his Majesty's Ministers for the time being and did expressly and distinctly make them subordinate and amenable to his Majesty's pleasure and to the directions of his Ministers in the same manner and upon the same footing and "under the same limitations and restrictions" as the Regulating Act of and the Act of and various other Acts had placed the Court of Directors chosen and appointed by the Company  G  Earl Fitzwilliam and the other Directors under Mr Fox's Bill could neither have had transactions with any of the country powers in the East Indies nor have directed hostilities against nor have concluded treaties with any state or power but subject to the orders of his Majesty and his Royal will and  pleasure signified to them by the Secretary of State they were bound by law to obey  H  Mr Fox's Bill placed the whole of the powers taken from the Company in the New Government established  at home  in order that they might be executed under the inspection and controul of the Legislature and of the public  I  Mr Fox's Bill established no system of  mystery  and  concealment  in the management of affairs of any sort but on the contrary did expressly provide that the conduct of the Board established by that Bill  should be clear and open that their opinions should "be given in no covert manner" and that their motives of conduct as well as their measures should stand "recorded on their journals signed with the name of each Director" thereby making them responsible to Parliament and to their Country by the best pledge and security for responsibilityan explicit avowal of their purposes at the time they resolved on their measures  K  Mr Fox's Bill avowed its object clearly and distinctly and was worded with such plainness and precision as to leave no room for misconstruction nor need of explanation in the minds of any but of those who would not take the trouble to examine it or who chose to misunderstand it or who were incapable of understanding any thing  L  Mr Fox's Bill was a measure of experiment the term of duration limited to four years and during that period the affairs of the Company were placed so immediately and intelligibly under the eye of Parliament that a permanent and well digested system for the future government of those valuable possessions might reasonably have been expected from the wisdom of the Legislature before that term should have been expired A system that might have restored to the Company all rights and p  eges which consistenty with the ends of good Government they could possese and have provided  and effectual securities to the Constitution  wherever the judgment of Parliament should have found it necessary to add to the power and influence of the Crown  A  MR PITT's BILL continues the form of the Company's Government  and professes to leave the patronage under certain conditions and the Commerce without condition in the bands of the Company but places all matters relating to the  Civil  and  Military  government and  Revenues  in the hands of six Commissioners to be nominated and appointed by his Majesty under the title of "  Commissioners for the Affairs of India  " which Board of Commissioners is invested with the "superintendance and controul over all the British territorial possessions in the East Indies and over the affairs of the United Company of Merchants trading thereto"  B  Mr Pitt's Bill denies to his Commissioners any right of  nominating  or  appointing  to any office Civil or Military but it reserves to them the power of annulling every appointment of the Company in a right of  recalling  every person Civil  or Military in the Company's service as well as an exclusive right to censure or approve suspend or reward according to their judgment and discretion  C  Mr Pitt's Bill professes to divide the poli  cal and commercial interests of the Company between the Board of Controul and the Directors but denies to the Directors the right to manage order or direct their commercial concerns in India unless their dispatches shall have received the sanction of the signatures of the Members of the Board of Controul and in case the said Board should directly interfere in the Commerce of the Company the remedy provided for the Directors is "an  appeal to the King in Council  " against  the decision of his Majesty's Ministers  and "his Majesty's decision in Council is final and conclusive" It also gives to the Board of Controul while it  professes to leave the trade of the Company independent an absolute power over the  territorial revenues  of the Company in India "the clear profits arising from which after defraying the charges and expences attending the same" form the principal if not the sole fund upon which their trade with India is now carried on  D  Mr Pitt's Bill was avowedly communicated to the Directors of the Company and to the Proprietors its several provisions discussed by them and many material alterations were made in the plan after it had been brought into Parliament declaredly for the purpose of according to the suggestions and granting the explanations required by the Company Upon this ground the Bill passed and since that time there is scarce any one right or power which the Company conceived to have been secured  to them which in the opinion of the Court of Directors has not been broken in upon by the Board of Controulthe Commissioners supporting their own construction of the law against the fruitless expostulations and remonstrances of the Directors  E  Mr Pitt's Bill  has  established a fourth or new estate or department of Government with powers infinitely exceeding those possessed by the Court of Directors or Court of Proprietors at the time when the said Board of Controul was established  F  Mr Pitt's Bill  has expressly repealed  all the provisions in the said Acts which gave to his Majesty any right power or authority to interfere in any matter or concern of the British  Government in India and has made the Board of Controul wholly  independent  in the exercise of their offices of  the general executive government  of the country they being neither bound to abide by his Majesty's will and pleasure or even to communicate with his Majesty upon any one measure or matter relating to India of any sort whatever  G  Mr Dundas  with any two more Commissioners  may transact matters of any sort with the country powers may  treat  with or  ally  with or declare  war  against or make  peace  with all or any of the Powers or Princes of India may levy  armies  there to any extent and command the whole  revenues  of all our possessions  for their support without taking his Majesty's pleasure upon any of the subjects in any shape and without acting in his name or under his authority and these things he may do against the will of the Directors and without the knowledge of Parliament so that in truth  the present Board of Controul  ave under Mr Pitt's Bill separated and usurped those  VERY IMPERIAL PREROGATIVES FROM THE CROWN  which were  FALSELY  said to have been given to the new board of Directors under Mr Fox's Bill  H  Mr Pitt's Bill assisted by the explanatory Act of  beside the  new  and  powers given to the Board of Controul  at home  has given to the Governors and Presidents  abroad  the most and extravagant authoritiesunlike any thing that could have been supposed to originate in a free state and utterly irreconcileable  to the spirit of the British Constitution by virtue of which despotic authority among other enormities which under the name of Government may be committed the Governor or President of the Council may upon his single pleasure seize and secure any British subjectin India of whatever rank or situation and upon the  accusation  only of any one person cause him to be thrown on shipboard or imprisoned until there shall be "a convenient opportunity of sending him to England" where by the same Billa new tribunal and proceedingequally unheard of in the Constitutionare provided for his trial  I  Mr Pitt's Bill has provided a  Secret Committee  in the Court of Directors who are bound by a solemn oath from which the  Board of Controul alone can release them  and through the Secret Committee who  are bound to obey all orders of that Board as the servants in India are bound to obey all orders of the Secret Committee  all the enormous powers  and  prerogatives  before mentioned may be exercised without a possibility should the Commissioners so please either that the  King  the  Company  or  Parliament  shall ever hear even of such orders until they shall have been carried into full effect  K  Mr Pitt's Bill in the preamble to all its clauses professes objects directly contrary to its enactments and is worded either with such crafty ambiguity or such contemptuous negligence that neither those whose interests were to be most affected by it nor those who have argued most in support of it have ever been able to agree upon its meaning and  the present Declaratory Law is the fourth subsidiary statute which in the space of four years has in vain endeavoured to explain the original Act  L  Mr Pitt's Bill and all its explanatory and supplemental Acts are  perpetual laws  and profess to be a  final arrangement  for the Government of India by which means the Company is wholly at the mercy of the Board of Controul not only with respect to the renewal of  their charter  of  exclusive trade  but with respect to their claim of property in the  territorial revenues  in India as well as in their  corporate capacity  as Merchants intitled to "a free trade in common with the rest of the King's subjects" although their monopoly should not be renewed and in this situation they are placed in direct violation of the saith of the Legislature engaged to them for  a valuable consideration upon a solemn compactwhile neither against the Board of Controul acting on purposes of exclusive power and ambition nor against the Crown acting in collusion with the Board of Controul and covertly directing its measures and its influence is there any provision made for the danger which may arise to the Constitution  OBSERVATIONS  A PATRONAGE  "  Patronage in the hands of the Company  " The purposes to which the Board of Controul may apply their power and the connexion of that power with Patrouage is strongly exemplified in their dispute with the Directors relative to the settlement of the Nabob of Arcot's debts to individuals amounting to nearly four millions sterling The Directors in pursuance of  the positive injunctions of Mr Pitt's Bill  conceiving themselves  indispensably bound to direct an inquiry to be instituted into the justice and origin of these debts  draw up their Orders to the Presidency of Madras accordingly They soon learn however that they have another master stronger than the law for the Board of Controul compel them to admit the whole of these debts without any such investigation as the law directed The Directors remonstrate in vain Contrary to what they declare to be their sense of the trust reposed in them contrary to what they conceive to be their duty under the law they are compelled to execute the orders of the Board of Controul as if they had been grounded on their own judg  ts and convictionThe Commissioners further adding  that if any creditor shall be found refractory or be disposed to  the arrangement  we  have  suggested  he shall be dismissed the service and sent home to England  Signed  HENRY DUNDAS  MULGRAVE  WALSINGHAM  W W GRENVILLE  th Octob    "  Nominating or Appointing  " IT has been urged that Mr Pitt's Bill had the merit of expressly  directing  a reduction of the establishments in India and of restricting both the Directors and the Board of Controul from sending out  new  servants Not even a Cadet beyond what was  actually necessary to keep up the proper complement of officers upon the reduced establishment  was to be permitted to sail from EnglandNo such restriction undoubtedly was imposed upon the Directors to be appointed under Mr Fox's Bill Parliament conceived that they had a better security and the event has shewn that they could not have taken a worse This cannot be placed in a stronger light than by supposing that Lord Fitzwilliam and his associates in the new arrangement had called aloud for checks to be imposed upon them had solicited to be restrained from the power of dissipating the Company's revenue and creating a Military Patronage at  their  expence had taken credit for tying up their own hands in their own Bill andwithin a short time after while the Company had  six hundred officers  reduced by the Peace establishment in India had created an opportunity for sending out  eighty six  NEW  officers  APPOINTED BY THEMSELVES at an expence to the Company of l per annum in peace and l per annum in war without a single plea or pretence which would not have been better answered by  sending out the man without the officers  A right of recalling every Person  IN October the Directors inform the Board of Controul that they have appointed John Holland  Esq  an old servant of the Company to succeed to the Government of Fort St George upon the death removal or resignation of Lord Macartney  The Board of Controul  the Directors'  right of appointment  but remonstrate against the nomination  upon certain grounds giving Mr Holland however due praise they add that it is their  wish to enforce to the Directors the propriety in every appointment not only of avoiding blameable appointments but such as may be open to  plausible misrepresentation  The Directors maintain their right and observe that the Board are interfering in matters  to which their controul professedly does not extend  The Board of Controul withdraw their opposition with saying  if the reasons which we have assigned do not satisfy the Court of Directors we have certainly no right to controul their opinion  Mr Holland however is peremptorily informed that if he sails for India under the Directors appointment he will be  recalled  the instant he arrives thereThe dispute ends and Sir Archibald Campbell the friend of Mr DUNDAS by a due exertion of the avowed  weight of influence  is appointed in his place  Censure and applause  IN July the Directors reprimanded Colonel Ross for what they maintained to be an outrageous contempt of their authority The Board of Controul alter the dispatch and refuse to let the reprimand stand The Directors remonstrate and declare that  the present occasion appears to them so momentous and a  submission on their part so destructive of all order and subordination in India  that they must take the liberty of informing the Right Honourable Board that no dispatch can be sent to India which does not contain their the Directors final decision on Lieutenant Colonel Ross  The matter is compromisedwith a declaration on the part of the Board of Controul in these words  We trust however that by this acquiescence it will not be understood that we mean to recognize  any power in  YOU to transmit  to India either  censure  or  approbation  of the conduct of  any servant    Civil  or  Military  exclusive of the Controul of THIS BOARD  Signed  HENRY DUNDAS  WALSINGHAM  W W GRENVILLE  MULGRAVE  Suspending and rewarding  IN July the Court of Directors disapprove of certain allowances or gratuities made to Sir John Dalling by the Government of Fort St George and tell their President that upon a full examination of the matter they think  he has acted improperly  The Board of Controul new model the dispatch and oblige the Directors to say that upon  mature consideration  they are  perfectly satisfied  assuring them that if they will peruse their  own papers again  they the Board of Controul are persuaded  you will be disposed to alter your opinion even more than we have altered your dispatch  The Court of Directors "alarmed" as they express themselves in a case of a similar nature respecting Colonel Geils's allowances  at the Board's exercising a  power over their purse  not conceiving it to have been the intention of the Act to give the Board such a power  remonstrate respectfully upon the occasion and declare that  they have  endeavoured  to adhere to a  system of oeconomy  which the condition of their finances require and the Legislature has thought fit to command and should be happy to meet the approbation and support of the Right Honourable Board therein The Act of Parliament  they add  we conceive meant to vest in your Right Honourable Board a controuling power respecting the  great objects  of the government of  the Company's affairs and to leave  the liquidation of accounts for services performed  and  all such details  in the Court of Directors  The Board of Controul inform themthat they  continue to be of their former opinion  they are at a loss to understand the grounds of objection  to their  right of controul  in this business as the claims of Sir John Dalling though he is now out of your service are founded upon his right when he was in your service and are to be paid out of the  Revenues of India  and of course  your opinions  upon them must be subject to  our revision  The Directors finding themselves without a remedy answer  We feel ourselves under the  necessity of acquiescing  in the determination of your Right Honourable Board But we trust upon further consideration your Right Honourable Board will not make such allowances a  perpetual charge  upon the Company  With these instances thus briefly stated selected from a number of similar cases and relating to the powers exercised by the Board of Controul with respect to  civil appointments    censure  and  applause    reward  and  punishment    military promotion  and  the purse  of the Company will it be credited that any many should have been stout enough to assert in the House of Commons that  the  whole business of Patronage  was left  exclusively  in the hands of the  Company  and that the Board of Controul would not even take it if it were offered to them  In truth the question  Whether or not the present Board of Controul possess the whole or any share of the Patronage in India  has lately been placed in a plainer light by the unguarded confessions of those who supported the Declaratory Bill than by any thing that could be said by those who opposed it Some gentlemen defined the authority  of the Board on this head to be  a power of circuitous nomination    others  appointment by the weight of influence    others  the right of authoritative recommendation    but by whatever name it is called or however the exercise of it may be disclaimed these facts are plain st That all the unbounded means of Patronage and Protection which the  Governor General  and the Presidents of the different Councils possess belong to those to whom in reality they owe their appointments and to whom only in fact they owe obedience dly That the Board of Controul are obviously seizing the whole of the  Military  Patronage into their own hands the intention of extinguishing the Company's service being plainly avowed dly That no person can look for protection to any quarter but to  the Board  or think of accepting any appointment against  their  will in the  civil  line  One distinction however is constantly taken upon this subject namely that Mr Pitt's Commissioners do not meddle with the  Patronage at home  which it is affirmed would have been at the disposal of Lord Fitzwilliam's Board under Mr Fox's Bill This Patronage whatever it is is always magnified and never explained As far as it means the nomination of Clerks and other officers at the India House it is not an object very much worth dispute but as far as it relates to contracts and money laid out in shipping and trade at home it should not be forgotten that the management of these matters was not placed in Lord Fitzwilliam's Board by Mr Fox's Bill but in a Board of  Assistant Directors  appointed by Parliament from among the then existing Directors or Proprietors of India Stock for that special purpose These Assistant Directors however being bound to obey the orders of the Superior Board Lord Fitzwilliam  might  have commanded their  Patronage and perverted their commercial dealings to his own political purposesgrantedthere was certainly no security against so flagrant an abuse of trust but in the character of the person trusted and what reason is there to think that the present Board of Controul have no weight of influence with respect to this very Patronage if they chose to act as they suppose Lord Fitzwilliam would have done Or who is there that does not see that the Court of Directors are becoming every day mere instruments in the hands of this Board and that there can be nothing of exclusive Patronage belonging to them more than would have belonged to the Assistant Directors under Mr Fox's Bill In plain sense the whole and only difference in point of Patronage between the two Boards is that by Mr Fox's Bill it was given  directly  and must have been exercised  openly  by Mr Pitt's Bill it is given  circuitously  and may be exercised  secretly  C  "  Appeal to the King  " The application to the  King in Council  which Mr Pitt's Bill declares it shall be  lawful  for the Court of Directors to make whenever they conceive the orders of the Board not to  relate  to  points connected  with the Civil or Military Government and Revenues in India is a strange mockery when gravely held out to the Company as a security against encroachment or interference in Commercial matters on the part of the Board of Controul It proves however how perfectly distinct in theory at least the framers of this Bill considered the Board of Controul from the general executive government of the countrythe limits of the authority of the Directors are circumscribed within certain bounds and if they transgress them or refuse obedience  where the law has commanded them to pay it redress is provided in the common course of law The law also prescribes limits to the authority and controul of the Commissioners but it provides no redress should they transgress them The most flagrant abuse of their trust under their own Bill would be in any instance to assume the management of the Company's Commerce yet if they can craftily effect this they may do it with impunity and whenever they are opposed if they can procure the sanction of the Council on their side that is fairly speaking of themselves in a different characterthey have the law on their side also  But there is nothing more curious than to observe the preposterous and degrading office which these zealous advocates for the dignity and prerogatives of the Crown have provided for the Monarch were ever such an appeal to be madeHis Majesty in Council shall decide  whether the dispatch or order referred to his Royal judgment be or be not connected with the  Civil  or  Military  Government and  Revenues  of the territories and possessions in India  and this decision is to be made upon such statements and information as the parties shall condescend to favour him with upon subjects wholly removed from the ordinary contemplation of his Majesty's Government Mr Dundas asserts that the measure proposed belongs to  his department exclusively  being a measure relating to  war  or  peace  or  negociation  or  revenue  and that therefore his  will  and  pleasure  ought to have been implicitly obeyed The Directors humbly contend without presuming to question the  sovereignity  of the Board of Controul that the measure is of a  Commercial  nature merelyHis Majesty sits the unprincely umpire between his contending  subjects deciding upon the extent of Imperial prerogatives in the exercise of which he has neither will nor voice  But if any thing further were wanting to shew the falacy of this pretended security to the rights of the Company we find it amply made out in the notable device of compelling the  Directors to establish  a  Secret Committee  to be  solely under the orders of the Board of Controul  The Secret Committee was accordingly soon employed contrary to the professed purpose of its institution and it was as soon predicted that the whole affair of an appeal to the King in Council might at once be evaded by the Board of Controul directing through their Secret Agents as matter  connected  with  revenue  or  negotiation  whatever  commercial  arrangement they pleasedBut it occurred to no man that the Board would be so unwary at least till the system should be more fully established as to endeavour to adopt a precedent for a right of  direct controul  and  management  over  commercial  matters without cover or pretence by means of or in collusion with the Secret Committee yet has this already been the case The Secret Committee to whom however no  intentional  illconduct is meant to be imputed on the first of June assume in concert with the Board of Controul powers from which both by law and the nature of their trust they were equally excluded They take upon themselves to direct a  purchase of cotton  to be made at Bombay for exportation to China and order five ships to receive the cargo and direct the remittance of a considerable sum from home to answer the expence all without the authority or knowledge of the Directors The Board of Controul approve the measure and the dispatch in the following terms unguardedly called in the House of Commons"  blindly lending their name in the usual form  "  Whitehall  d June  Approved by the Board with an omission of the words within brackets beginning at 'considering the' and ending at 'Controul' in the fourth paragraph of this draft  W PITT  HENRY DUNDAS  W W GRENVILLE  MULGRAVE  The measure itself also was so far from being  universally approved of by the Court of Directors  when made known to them as was also unguardedly insinuated that a very strong Protest against the whole proceeding was entered upon the records of the Company in which it was declared to be a transaction  contrary to the original constitution of the Company and to every subsequent Act of Parliament which has passed relative to its affairs and that if the like power shall be extended to other objects and to other Presidencies which  it may be  under  the same pretext  on which it has been assumed and exercised on the present occasion the collective authority of the Court of Directors will be annihilated the legal mode of conducting the Company's business set aside and ANOTHER SYSTEM  introduced    illegal in itself  and  dangerous in its consequences    Signed  JOSEPH SPARKES  RICHARD HALL  JOHN ROBERTS  FRANCIS BARING  GEORGE CUMING  CHARLES MILLS  EastIndia House  nd August  It is plain that no proceeding could be more unwarrantable in all its parts The Board of Controul gave an illegal sanction to an illegal transaction And both parties seem to have been surprized into a small neglect of the  spirit  of their oath of office The Members of the Secret Committee take an oath that  they will according to the best of their skill and judgment faithfully execute the several trusts and powers reposed in them as Members of the Secret Committee  appointed by the Directors  of the United Company of Merchants trading to the East Indies  They also swear secrecy to the Board of Controul but the  trust  required by  their oath to the Directors  is clearly to  confine themselves to  the  purposes of their appointment  and those purposes are accurately defined by the Act that authorizes their institution to be the executing of the  secret orders  and instructions of the Board of Controul concerning the  levying of war  or  making of peace  or  treating or negotiating  with any of the native Princes or States of India The Board of Controul also swear to execute faithfully the several powers and  trusts  reposed in  them  by  the spirit of which oath  they are unquestionably  precluded  from circumventing the Court of Directors in the management of their Commerce Whether the transaction itself was likely to be profitable or otherwise to the Company is nothing to the purpose the consequences to which the  principles  and the  precedent  lead must be obvious to every one  "  Power over the territorial revenues  " THE Court of Directors in the last statement of their affairs laid before Parliament directed the attention of the House of Commons to the two funds from which their resources are to arise and from which they are to derive the means of extricating themselves from their difficulties These are the  profits of their trade  with India and China and the  surplus  of their  territorial revenues  The formet they state upon a very sanguine calculation of their probable amount as sufficient besides providing for the China investment to pay the debts then engaged to be discharged at home and the debts proposed to be brought home from India to which purpose their faith is engaged The latter the surplus of their territorial revenue as the fund upon which their India investment is to depend and over THIS FUND THE BOARD OF CONTROUL CLAIM AN ABSOLUTE POWER  D  Expostulation and Remonstrances of the Directors  The differences which have subsisted between the Court of Directors and the Board of Controul have not been upon  measures  or upon  matters of opinion  or upon trivial points but all of them upon questions of  right  of  law  and upon the  nature  and  limits  of their respective  powers  Such differences however will probably no more be heard ofThe last ineffectual struggle of the Company appears to have been made In one dispute they tried in vain to obtain the Minister's countenance to apply to the Representatives of the People to arbitrate between them and the Board of Controul In another they requested to be permitted to apply to the Kingthis was also refused In the last they looked for redress in an appeal to the Courts of Justice in this they were frustrated by the Legislature being induced to think it proper to decide the point and  declare  the law against them Thus circumstanced shut out from Law Parliament and the Throne it is but reasonable to believe that the Court of Directors will no more be heard of but as an instrument to serve the  ambition or to skreen the misconduct of their masters  E FOURTH ESTATE  "  New Estate or Department  " The purposes and characters of men have been often misrepresented and misunderstood through the efforts and prejudices of party but it is a most singular circumstance that nearly a whole nation should have been persuaded to understand a Bill passed in the House of Commons and given to the public in print in a manner directly contrary to its plain meaning and express provisions and that even sober and rational men should have joined in the outcry against it without giving themselves the trouble to examine whether it really was the measure which it was represented to be  Whatever other faults were found with Mr Fox's Bill nothing certainly operated more in the clamour that was raised against it than a confused notion that it some way or other attacked the prerogatives of the Crown and aimed to take from the King certain powers and authorities which of right belonged to him This idea whether urged by the mob as  an attempt to take the Crown from the King's head    or in the politer jargon of a  fourth estate    and  imperium in imperio    was certainly a main ingredient in the delusion which pervaded the country at the last general election Yet is it utterly impossible for any man of common sense to read the Bill  attentively  without being puzzled to guess at the ground upon which such a deception could so long have been maintained  Mr Fox's Bill enacted in fact nothing new of any sort with respect to the Royal Authority nor did it contain any one thing in derogation of any one prerogative of the Crown If the existence of  Directors for the management of the affairs of the East India  Company  constituted a  fourth Estate  that fourth estate existed before and this very phrase is to be found in pamphlets written against this very Company twenty years since If a  parliamentary  nomination of persons to be concerned in the government of India was an  attack upon the constitution  the constitution had sustained and survived a similar attack in the Regulating Act of and in the subsequent Bills which repeated those  Parliamentary  appointments If the employing the Patronage of the Company without the King's authority was an  invasion of his prerogative  it was of a prerogative never heard of for the Crown had never had the grant of a single office civil or military belonging to the service of the East India Company In fact so far as the Crown was concerned at all it acquired in the right of nominating to the vacant offices in the new commission a power the King had never possessed before Whether the  new  Directors for the affairs of India were likely to make a  better government  than the  old  is not the question the extraordinary circumstance is that this Bill which left the Crown  in the full possession of its prerogatives  of  war    peace  and  negotiation  in India should have been represented as  depriving it of its just rights  and raising a  Parliamentary commussion above its authority  and that Mr Pitt's Bill which  actually strips the Throne  of those main ensigns of  Imperial authority  should have been universally admitted at least to have the merit of a  due deference to the rights and person of the Sovereign  However when people are pressed to explain what their meaning isthey are compelled to own that when they speak of a  fourth estate  and an  overthrowing of the constitution  and an  attack upon the prerogative  they do not mean that all this was done or attempted by the Bill butthat these things  might  have come to pass in consequence of it  because say they a great political party having got possession of the  Patronage  of India for four years they would instantly have become so strong that the King could not easily have dismissed them and so the  prerogative would have been invaded  This party would also in time by means of this Patronage have been able to obtain a predominant party in Parliament and so the  constitution would have been destroyed  Now to make any sense of the first objection it is necessary to assert as all violent people did that although the King she should have thought proper to have dismissed the  Duke of Portland's Administration  and had been equally desirous of changing the  Indian Administration  yet that Lord Fitzwilliam and his Board could have held complete and independent possession of the Government of India for four years in spight of his Royal wishes and have applied all the Patronage and influence of their situation to the support of the exministers This is literally what every man meant who meant any thing or who had any sincere alarm on the subject That the mere vulgar or very ignorant people should have adopted this notion is not very strange considering the pains which were taken to circulate it but that a person of LORD CAMDEN'S character accustomed to consider laws with temper and deliberation should now again have gravely detailed all this sort of argument in the House of Lords have warned them against this  fourth estate  this  imperium in imperio  asserting as is reported  that had his Majesty thought proper by virtue of his undoubted prerogative to have dismissed Mr Fox and his party from his service we might have seen the  King of Great Britain  and the  King of Bengal  contending in Parliament for superiority  is a matter altogether surprisingIt is surprising because the whole of the  if seriously urged must arise from a perfect misapprehension of the Bill and be founded upon the false  and perverse notion before stated that the Board appointed by it was placed out of the reach and above the controul of the King's Ministers for the time being Two gentlemen of the House of Commons of great ability and character Mr SCOTT and Mr HARDINGconfessed very candidly that they had been in a mistake with respect to this part of the Bill they still however persisted to argue upon conclusions founded upon acknowledged error  What is the real caseMr Fox's Bill enacts  that the  said Directors hereby appointed  or any three of them shall have use possess exercise all and singular the powers and authorities which have been at any time heretofore vested in or lawfully exercised by the said Directors hereby discontinued or Proprietors or by the General Court of Proprietors of the said United Company and all such farther and other powers and authorities and  under such directions  and  subject to such limitations and restrictions as in this act  or  in  ANY OTHER ACT the provisions where of ARE NOT HEREBY ALTERED OR REPEALED are contained for the government and management of the said territorial possessions revenues and commerce of the said United Company or in any wise relative thereto And further that in all cases whatsoever where any act matter or thing is directed to be done or consented to or any accounts or writings to be signed by the Directors hereby discontinued  such act matter or thing  shall from and after the commercement of this act be  done  or consented to and such accounts or writings shall be signed by  three of the Directors hereby appointed  Now in order to understand what the real situation of  the new Directors  would have been and what the extent of their powers it should seem  that the natural thing was to examine what  were  the  directions    limitations  and  restrictions  not expressly repealed under which they were left In this case it would have appearedthat Lord FITZWILLIAM and his Board were bound to communicate to his Majesty's Ministers for the time being  an exact copy of all dispatches and letters received from India or proposed to be sent thither which should    ANY WAY RELATE to the REVENUES or to the CIVIL and MILITARY affairs and GOVERNMENT of the said  United Company  That Lord FITZWILLIAM and his Board were bound  to pay  DUE OBEDIENCE  to and to be  GOVERNED  and  BOUND  by such  INSTRUCTIONS  as they should receive  FROM HIS MAJESTY  by one of his Majesty's principal Secretaries of State  IN ALL THEIR CONDUCT  and  TRANSACTIONS  and in those of their Governors Presidents and Councils respectively with the  COUNTRY POWERS  in the East Indies and also in regard to the  LEVYING WAR  and  MAKING PEACE  That Lord FITZWILLIAM and his Board had no means of using the credit of the East India Company for the relief of the Company's pressing distresses  without the  CONSENT  and  ORDER  first had and obtained of the Commissioners of his Majesty's Treasury for the time being  That Lord FITZWILLIAM and his Board in making provision for the defence of the possessions in the East Indies were bound to act  on the requisition and under the inspection of the Commissioners of his Majesty's Navy and Office of Ordnance  Upon the whole it would have appeared that their Board was placed in every important matter under so strong a controul of the  Ministers for the time being  and so wholly without the power of acting upon their own judgment or discretion in all the more important objects of their institution that no set of men who were not content from  the meanest motives to hold the  appearance  of power upon the most abject conditions could have remained in their Offices a week with an Administration desirous to get rid of them Let these plain facts be once understood let the state of subordination of the new Directors to the King's Government be fairly examined and it will be apparent at oncethat without having recourse to a Parliamentary addressthe Duke of Portland's Administration once dismissed the resignation of Lord Fitzwilliam's Board must have followed instantly that is if it was the object of the advisers of the Crown to change the Indian Governmentif  otherwise  undoubtedly Lord Fitzwilliam and his associates were at liberty to continue in a laborious duty without pay or emolument and incapacitated from accepting any place of profit from the Crown and to sacrifice their ease and their time under Ministers with whom they had no bond of union nor habits of regard from a desire to do good and to effect the great puposes of their appointmentthe reform of the abuses in India and the reestablishment of the British character To execute this trust faithfully a rigid scrutiny into past misconduct a severe oeconomy in future arrangements a just disinterested and impartial management of Patronage would have been among the first duties expected from them While they  so  acted if it was the King's pleasure his Ministers whoever they were might certainly have  abstained  from the exercise of the decisive controul they possessed over them but then wherein would have consisted the attack on the prerogative or the danger of the Constitution But supposing a different conduct to have been pursued by the Boardthat forgetting what they owed to their own characters as well as to the duties of their station they had perverted the powers of their trust  and had endeavoured to employ them solely to answer party purposes at homethe remedy was at hand and the first application of it must have been effectual  This being the fact an objection of a different nature may no doubt be instantly made namely that as the King was to nominate to  vacancies upon resignation  the Bill might have been used not to  destroy  but to  increase  the power of the Crownthe truth is that it were much to be wished that this objection could be as easily answered as the other MR GRENVILLE was the only person connected with the present Administration who argued the Bill upon this ground at the time of its passing through the House of Commons The fair answer however is that there was every security taken against this worst of mischiefs which the nature of the measure itself and the urgent necessity which called for it admitted of The public had a pledge in the characters of the persons who framed that Bill in the whole tenor of their political life and in their recent and honest exertions to reduce the influence of the Crown that it was not  their  intention at least to deceive or delude them upon this subjectIf these Ministers were displaced there was the same security in the character of the Indian Board and in the very principle upon which it had been formed If  they  too were obliged to abandon their situation these securities certainly vanished and the Crown might  for whatever term remained of the four years  have placed the powers given to the Parliamentary trustees in the hands of its own creatures But this could not have been done  secretly  or  silently  not without serious discussionnot without the attention of the Public being immediately and forcibly drawn to the subject and to the characters and principles of the new Board no new arrangement  could pretend to claim the confidence of a Parliamentary nomination Parliament must therefore have had the matter before them in a new point of view and have become accessory to the surrender if they were to be surrendered of those powers and that patronage to the Crownwhich all parties professed so much to dread to see lodged thereAgainst such a conduct in Parliament there is certainly no remedy nor ever will be  The only thing like an objection on this head remaining is that upon a supposition that his Majesty had been pleased to continue the Duke of Portland's Administration for the term of four years for which the India Board was appointed the supposed good understanding between the Ministers and the new India Government would have given them an opportunity of using the Company's influence and Patronage to make friends and to create an interest which might have been of use to them at the end of that term This undoubtedly  might  have been the case but not without an abuse of their trust and against this the public had certainly no security but in the character of the Board In a comparison however of the two Bills it is obvious to askwhat security have the public against the same thing now The means of Patronage and influence to all important purposes were before proved to be equal and if Mr Pitt and Mr Dundas have for their object the attaching a  powerful Indian interest  both at home and abroad to  themselves  who that observes and understands the measures daily pursued both with regard to the  Directors  the  Proprietors  the  Army  and the  Governments  and  Councils  abroad can be so duped as not to own that a very few years more must make  them  as formidable as Indian influence and attachment so concentred and headed can make any party  G  "  Mr Dundas with any two more Commissioners  " IN the Committee upon Mr  Pitt's Bill  it was moved that of the  three  Members of the Board of Controul who were empowered to sign dispatches relating to  war    peace  c  one should be the  Secretary of State  or the  Chancellor of the Exchequer  for the time being  This was negatived upon a division "  Ayes    Noes  " Such was the confidence the House thought this board entitled to independently of its connexion with the ostensible Ministers  H  In speaking of Mr Fox's plan it is a circumstance generally overlooked that it consisted of  two  Bills brought into the House of Commons together tho'  the Bill appointing the new Directors  only reached the House of Lords The otherthe Bill for the better Government of the Territorial Possessions contained many excellent regulations for the relief and protection of the natives of India and many  real  guards against the abuse of power and the means of corrupt patronage in the hands of our Governorsit also contained an undoubted testimony that it was not the intention of that Administration to make Parliament a ready asylum for those who might be accused of delinquencies abroad or to use the influence of their situation to create an Indian interest for their support  I SECRET COMMITTEE  THE Secret Committee created by Mr Pitt's Bill in the Court of Directors is an instrument of government unlike any thing existing in any other country or any thing to be found in the history of  all past governments A body of men in authority the Court of Directors acting under a delegated trust from their constituents the East India Company take an oath on their election to support the interests and rights of the CompanyThese Directors are then bound by law to choose a Secret Committee from among themselves which Secret Committee are to take an oath to be true to the trust reposed in them by the Directors but to obey only such orders and directions as they shall receive from the Board of Controul which orders and directions they swear also never to communicate to the Directors who appoint them without the consent of the said Board of ControulThis Secret Committee have no power of originating or direcing any thing to be done of their own authority still less by suggestion or instruction from the Directors all the Governments and Presidencies however in India are bound to pay a faithful obedience to their orders and dispatches and to answer the same upon the same terms of secrecy  as if such Orders and Directions had been issued and transmitted by the Court of Directors of the said United Company  If it were worth reasoning or arguing upon it would be no difficult matter to prove that this crooked system of involved mystery and contradictory duties could never have been meant for any fair purpose of good government Facts however make reasoning on the subject unnecessary The institution had scarcely taken place with the addition of the  added in the Explanatory Act passed in  before this Committee appointed for the purpose of issuing the secret instructions of the Board of Controul relating to matters of  war  and  peace  are directed to manage as a  matter of se  ecy  the  settlement of an old debt  due from the Nabob of Arcot to the Company  Nothing could be more clearly out of the spirit and meaning of the Act of than this measure The Board of Controul had already assumed an arbitrary power of settling the debts due from the Nabob to  individuals  as  matter connected with revenue  The Directors conceived they might at least have been permitted to settle  their own  debt which was their property and stated as part of their effects to Parliament but this was discovered to be  matter connected with negociation  The Board of Controul had no power to issue their orders through the  Secret Committee  with respect to matters of  revenue  but with respect to  treaties  with  native Princes  they had accordingly the settling a sufficient security for an old and public debt to the Company due from a dependent on their Government was converted into  a negociation of state  deemed a matter of secresy and withdrawn even from the knowledge of those who alone had any title to the debt The Directors apply to their Counsel and they are truly informed by Mr Rous that  the whole effect of the last Regulating Bill in constituting the two Boards of Directors and of Commissioners the one proposing measures and the other after representation finally deciding will be lost as far as concerns the Government of Madras  if the intercourse with the Nabob shall be confined to the Secret Department  because this intercourse involves directly the arrangements respecting the military force and indirectly  every interest of that settlement  The dispute comes before the Court of Proprietors who resolve on the th of June  that the construction of the Act of the th of his present Majesty under which the Right Honourable Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India have claimed to exercise the powers in instances before the Court is  subversive  of the authority of the Court of Directors  and the  Chartered Rights  of the Company recognized and confirmed by the said Act and tends to establish a  Secret System of Government highly dangerous to the interests of the Public and the Company  It was farther  resolved unanimously    that this General Court do return thanks to the Court of Directors for the  firmness  with which they have  maintained the rights of the Company  against the  claims of the Right Honourable Board of Commisioners for the Affairs of India  and that the spirited Protest of Mr Samuel Smith merits the approbation of his constituents  Upon this the Court of Directors resolve that  it is expedient to apply to the Legislature for a further explanation and more correct limitation of the powers of the Board of Controul  At the same time however with a very natural caution they think it prudent to ask  Mr Pitt's permission  to do so first Accordingly the Chairman and Deputy Chairman are directed to wait on the Chancellor of the Exchequer and propose the following question  If the Court of Directors with the authority of the General Court of Proprietors  shall think proper to apply to Parliament to  explain the powers of the Board of Controul with regard to the secret correspondence relative to the country powers of India will  you  assist them in their application  Here seems to have been a reasonable case made for a  Declaratory Law  if according to  Mr Scott    a material difference of opinion between the Company and the Board of Controul is a sufficient ground for one  The Chancellor of the Exchequer however after due deliberation answers that  he cannot agree in the sentiments expressed in the Resolution concerning the conduct of the  Right Honourable  Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India and does not see any ground for an application to Parliament on the subject  In a Court of Proprietors these proceedings being reported it was moved  that a Committee be appointed to take into consideration the state of this Company under the operation and effect of the last act of the th and th of George III  Upon this a ballot was demanded in which the refractory conduct of the Court of Directors and Proprietors having created a considerable alarm a proper  weight of influence  was exerted and the question passed in  the negative  Mr Samuel Smith's testimony on this occasion as he has been a zealous friend to the present Administration in Parliament must be admitted to be at least free from party prejudice He says in the Protest above alluded to containing the reasons of his resignation  It will be in vain to contend that the  Patronage  is secured to the  Company  by the Act of Parliament if  the Government is secret  it will be absurd to suppose that the  Patronage will be open  or that those  who have no voice in the measure  will have much concern  if any    in the appointments  if they have not to what evils so often foreboded as dangerous to this Constitution will not this  mysterious  government of India expose us And if this is to be contended as a  necessary mode of managing and controuling the Affairs of India  it will in my opinion give rise to a question whether  under such circumstances of danger to the Constitution our Indian possessions are worth retaining  A public situation reduced to the mere  mechanism of official obedience  can afford but little credit even by the most rigid discharge of its functions Circumscribed as the power of the  Court now is and by the interpretation given to the clause to which I allude incapable of acting either with energy or effect it  must ere long yield an easy surrender of its remaining rights to the encroachments and vigilance of a more active controul  Thus circumstanced the office of a Director may be the object of obloquy and though liable to a serious responsibility in the case of misconduct in others is too subordinate to continue the post either of independence or honour  It is therefore my intention to resign my trust to the Proprietors conscious that while I held it I endeavoured to discharge it to the best of my abilities and with an integrity unimpeached  Signed SAMUEL SMITH JUNR  IndiaHouse  June th  In fact this transaction established the power of the Board of Controul to act thro' the  Secret  Committee UPON ALL MATTERS and IN ANY MANNER they may think proper without a possibility of check and with scarce a probability of detection  K  Agree upon its Meaning  THE Declaratory Law was defended by many upon the ground of its declaring no more power to be in the Board of Controul than it was fit and reasonable to give them and that to suppose that the Original Act had given them less was to admit that Parliament had enacted an absurd and inconsistent law This argument altho' a popular one and sanctionedaltho' a popular oneby LORD HAWKESBURY is an intolerably bad argument when applied to Parliament acting in a great measure in their judicial capacity It is to set up their pride against their justice and to pique them to commit an act of violence rather than confess an act of folly Other Members  however in both Houses of Parliament professed that  they  supported the Declaratory Law as a true construction of Mr Pitt's Bill from a recollection of  their own meaning  at the time they voted for it Yet few of these Members agreed with each other as to the powers they conceived they  had  given to the Board of Controul LORD CAMDEN having been out of the kingdom when the Act of passed professed to have nothing to say to the  intentions  of the Legislature in passing the Act but to have formed  his  opinion upon  the plain and obvious meaning of  the clauses taken collectively  The learned Lord was obliged however to admit that there were many words omitted which were necessary to make out his instruction and many others inserted which directly contradicted it but this he presumed to have happened through  inadvertency  and therefore a whole clause coming under the latter description  nil operatur  A new and most extraordinary mode the most unlearned man may venture to assert of interpreting laws affecting the rights and property of the subject  But the pleasantest ground was taken by the DUKE of RICHMOND The noble Duke declared he had voted  against  Mr Pitt's Bill because he  differed  at the time from those who had introduced it with respect to its meaning  He  thinking that it  did  actually give those powers to the Board of Controul which  they  asserted were  not  meant to be given It now therefore appearing that they had come over to  his  opinion  consistency  demanded from him to give vigour and efficacy to a lawwhich justice and policy had convinced him ought never to have existed  It would certainly be a difficult task to argue on the  intentions  of different Members at the time the Act of passed and a very unfair way of arguing with respect to any but those who publicly gave  their enterpretation of the Bill during its progress Mr BASTARD'S quotations from the Minister's former speeches seem to have been generally admitted to have contained a true exposition of the Minister's former meaning but there is one decisive test easily recurred to which was very ably argued upon by Mr POWIS namely to compare the Bill in the state in which it was  first  brought into the House by Mr Pitt with  that  to which he altered it after a discussion with the Directors in the Committee Here it will decisively appear that many of these very powers which are  now  contended to be given to the Board of Controul by  construction  and  implication  were  directly  and  plainly  given in the Bill as  it stood on its first reading  and were afterwards withdrawn or modified upon  conference  and  explanation  with these who objected to them as intrenching on right which they had not consented to yieldThis evidence is conclusive  "  Explain the original Act  " THERE is no instance perhaps wherein the extraordinary spirit in which Mr Pitt's Bill is worded appears more plainly than in its bold and irregular manner of repealing matters supposed to be inconsistent with the new enactments  In all the former Acts we find a regard to perspicuity and fair dealing expressed as in the Act of st of the present King  And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid that  all and every the rights  interests powers privileges and authorities which are now vested in the said United Company of Merchants of England trading to the East Indies and  which are  NOT  hereby  EXPRESSLY TAKEN AWAY altered or varied shall remain to and continue in the said Company in as full and ample a manner to all intents and purposes whatsoever as if this Act had never been made  This is the language of laws that mean to be intelligible and to do justice  Mr Pitt's Bill settles the point in a different manner  And be it further enacted that all such powers and authorities given to or vested in the Proprietors and Directors of the said United Company or in any General or Special Court thereof respectively in and by any Act of Parliament or Charter as are  contrary  or REPUGNANT to THIS ACT or ANY THING HEREIN CONTAINED shall be and the same are hereby REPEALED any thing contained in any Act or Charter or any custom or usage to the contrary notwithstanding  Whether under this loose and arrogant mandate so unlike the temperate precision of a British law upon such a subject there is any one  right    power  or  property  of any sort left to the Company may reasonably be doubted indeed since the construction given to "THIS ACT" by the Declaratory Law it is difficult to imagine any power ever exercised by them which might not be proved in a court of justice to be  repugnant to something  contained in Mr Pitt's Bill  L  "  Mr Pitt's Bill a perpetual law  IT was proposed both in the House of Lords and in the House of Commons to limit the duration of the powers of the Board of Controul to the term for which the Company held their charter of exclusive trade It is scarcely to be conceived that if this question were to be fairly argued upon its own ground when Ministers should be graciously disposed to allow a little time for its discussion that either Mr PITT or Lord HAWKESBURY could easily prevail on either House of Parliament to reject it because such a conduct would be in fact to induce the legislature  deliberately to violate a solemn compact made between Parliament and a body of merchants not with respect to their charter of  power  and  monopoly  which being a trust as all power is might be resumed upon abuse but with respect to  estates    rights  and  property  which no mismanagement could forfeit and for which a valuable consideration had been paid to the public  By the Act of the st of his present Majesty the Company's charter of exclusive trade will expire in upon previous notice from ParliamentThe th and th clauses of this Act repeat the reservation in favour of the rights and privileges of the Company independently of their right to the exclusive trade and stating the consideration paid  for the service of the Crown of England  entitling them to these advantages    conclude in these words  Provided always and it is hereby further enacted that nothing in the above proviso or in any proviso in the said Act of the ninth year of the reign of his said late Majesty King William the Third or in the said charter of the fifth day of September in the tenth year of his said late Majesty's reign or in any other act or charter contained shall extend or be construed to extend to  determine the Corporation  of the said United Company of Merchants of England trading to the East Indies or to  hinder    prevent  or  exclude  the said United Company from carrying on AT ALL TIMES  after such determination of the right to the sole whole and exclusive trade  as aforesaid a FREE TRADE in to and from the East Indies and parts aforesaid with all or any part of their  own joint stock  in trade goods merchandizes estate and effects IN COMMON with OTHER THE SUBJECTS OF HIS MAJESTY his heirs and successors trading in to or from those parts  After this to enact a law to place them in their corporate capacity as merchants united to trade  upon their own joint stock and estate  without any exclusive right or protection from Government whatever under the  perpetual controul  of certain Commissioners  named by the Crown  to whom they are bound  to communicate all their transactions    and without whose signature they can issue no one commercial order is surely a most flagrant and wanton violation of private property as well as public faith and indeed of every right that law or charter can be supposed to secure to any one  With respect to the Company's  claim  on the  territorial revenues  the breach of faith is the sameThe Company paid the public a certain sum upon the last settlement on this subject and it was enacted  that all the territorial acquisitions and revenues lately obtained in the East Indies shall remain in the possession of the United Company of Merchants of England trading to the East Indies for and during the term of the exclusive trade granted to the said United Company  It was stipulated however that beside the sum paid a further proportion of the surplus profits of these revenues should be  set apart and applied for  the use of the public    with this reserve  so long as the Company shall be entitled to the  sole  and  exclusive  trade  st George III  Upon these terms the  question of right  between the  public  and the  Company  was  suspended  until the expiration of the charter of monopoly And the saving clause which had been inserted in all former Acts relating to this point was repeated Clause  Provided always and be it enacted that nothing herein contained shall extend or be construed to extend to prejudice or affect the rights or the claims of the public or  the said United Company  respecting the said territorial acquisitions and  revenues  The right of the Company under this compact isnot to  the property  of the revenues certainly but to a  decision  upon the subject on the expiration of their charter of exclusive trade or to be placed in the same situation with  respect to their claim  in which they stood when they made their bargain In lieu of this a  new Claimant  is created by Parliament being  neither the public  nor the  Company  to whom the law gives the  perpetual disposal  of these revenues so claimed by the public on one part and the Company on the other For it is to be remembered granting the Board of Controul to be acting for the Crown that the King is  not  the representative of the  Public  with respect to their  property  and  purse  but that on the contrary the Constitution regards with jealousy and places no trust in the Crown upon that head so that the  Public  would be defrauded although the revenues were to come under the disposal of the  King  But even that is not the case for the Board of Controul can appropriate them  without the direction of the Crown  as well as without the direction of the Company or of Parliament Parliament therefore breaks its faith to the Company without doing justice to the Public and the title and claims of both are extinguished not in favour of the Crown but in favour of a FOURTH ESTATE which acquires the strange and anomalous right either of disposing of the PROPERTY OF INDIVIDUALS against their consent or of applying the PROPERTY OF THE STATE without the sanction of Parliament  FINIS
