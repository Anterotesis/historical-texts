 THE LUCUBRATIONS OF  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  VOL IV  THE LUCUBRATIONS OF  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Revised and Corrected by the Author  VOL IV  Homer  LONDON  Printed by  John Nutt  and sold by  John Mor∣phew  near  Stationers Hall  MDCCXII  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE  CHARES Lord Hallifax  From the Hovel at  HamptonWick  April  My LORD  WHEN I first resolved upon doing my self this Honour I could not but indulge a certain Vanity in dating from this little Covert where I have frequent∣ly had the Honour of your Lord∣ship's Company and received from you very many Obligations The elegant Solitude of this Place and  the greatest Pleasures of it I owe to its being so near those Beautiful Man∣nors wherein you sometimes reside It is not retiring from the World but enjoying its most valuable Bles∣sings when a Man is permitted to share in your Lordship's Conversa∣tions in the Country All the bright Images which the Wits of past Ages have left behind them in their Wri∣tings the noble Plans which the greatest Statesmen have laid down for Administration of Affairs are equally the familiar Objects of your Knowledge But what is peculiar to your Lordship above all the illu∣strious Personages that have appear∣ed in any Age is that Wit and Learning have from your Example fallen into a new  Aera  Your Pa∣tronage has produced those Arts which before shunned the Com∣merce of the World into the Ser∣vice of Life and it is to you we owe that the Man of Wit has turn∣ed himself to be a Man of Business The false Delicacy of Men of Ge∣nius  and the Objections which o∣thers were apt to insinuate against their Abilities for entring into Af∣fairs have equally vanished And Experience has shown that Men of Letters are not only qualify'd with a greater Capacity but also a grea∣ter Integrity in the Dispatch of Bu∣siness Your own Studies have been diverted from being the highest Or∣nament to the highest Use to Man∣kind and the Capacities which would have rendered you the greatest Poet of your Age have to the Advan∣tage of  Great Britain  been employ'd in Pursuits which have made you the most able and unbiassed Patriot A vigorous Imagination an exten∣sive Apprehension and a ready Judg∣ment have distinguished you in all the illustrious Parts of Administra∣tion in a Reign attended with such Difficulties that the same Talents without the same Quickness in the Possession of them would have been incapable of Conquering The natural Success of such Abilities has advan∣ced  you to a Seat in that illustrious House where you were received by a Crowd of your Relations Great as you are in your Honours and Personal Qualities I know you will forgive an humble Neighbour the Vanity of pretending to a Place in your Friendship and subscribing himself  My LORD  Your Lordship's Most Obliged and Most Devoted Servant  Richard Steele  THE PREFACE  IN the last  Tatler  I promised some Explana∣tion of Passages and Persons mention'd in this Work as well as some Account of the Assi∣stances I have had in the Performance I shall do this in very few Words for when a Man has no Design but to speak plain Truth he may say a great deal in a very narrow Compass I have in the Dedication of the First Volume made my Acknowledgments to Dr  Swift  whose plea∣sant Writings in the Name of  Bickerstaff  crea∣ted an Inclination in the Town towards any Thing that could appear in the same Disguise I must acknowledge also that at my first entring upon this Work a certain uncommon Way of Thinking and a Turn in Conversation peculiar to that agree∣able Gentleman rendered his Company very ad∣vantageous to one whose Imagination was to be continually employed upon obvious and common Subjects though at the same Time obliged to treat of them in a new and unbeaten Method His Verses on the  Shower in Town  and the  De∣scription of the Morning  are Instances of the Happiness of that Genius which could raise such Pleasing Idea's upon Occasions so barren to an ordinary Invention  When I am upon the House of  Bickerstaff  I must not forget that Genealogy of the Family sent to me by the Post and written as I since under∣stand by Mr  Twisden  who died at the Battle of  Mons  and has a Monument in  WestminsterAbbey  suitable to the Respect which is due to his Wit and his Valour There are through the Course of the Work very many Incidents which were written by unknown Correspondents Of this Kind is the Tale in the Second  Tatler  and the Epistle from Mr  Downes  the Prompter with others which were very well received by the Publick But I have only one Gentleman who will be nameless to thank for any frequent Assi∣stance to me which indeed it would have been barbarous in him to have denied to one with whom he has lived in an Intimacy from Childhood con∣sidering the great Ease with which he is able to dispatch the most entertaining Pieces of this Na∣ture This good Office he performed with such Force of Genius Humour Wit and Learning that I fared like a distressed Prince who calls in a powerful Neighbour to his Aid I was undone by my Auxiliary when I had once called him in I could not subsist without Dependance on him  The same Hand writ the distinguishing Cha∣racters of Men and Women under the Names of  Musical Instruments the Distress of the NewsWriters the Inventory of the Play∣house  and  the Description of the Thermo∣meter  which I cannot but look upon as the great∣est Embellishments of this Work  Thus for I thought necessary to say relating to the great Hands which have been concerned in these Volumes with Relation to the Spirit and Genius of the Work and am far from pretending to Modesty in making this Acknowledgment What a Man obtains from the good Opinion and Friend∣ship of worthy Men is a much greater Honour than he can possibly reap from any Accomplishments of his own But all the Credit of Wit which was given me by the Gentlemen abovementioned with whom I have now accounted has not been able to attone for the Exceptions made against me for some Raillery in Behalf of that learned Ad∣vocate for the Episcopacy of the Church and the Liberty of the People Mr  Hoadley  I mention this only to defend my self against the Imputation of being moved rather by Party than Opinion and I think it is apparent I have with the ut∣most Frankness allowed Merit wherever I found it though joined in Interests different from those for which I have declared my self When my  Fa∣vonius  is acknowledged to be Dr  Smalridge  and the amiable Character of the Dean in the Sixty sixth  Tatler  drawn for Dr  Atterbury  I hope I need say no more as to my Impartiality  I really have acted in these Cases with Honesty and am concerned it should be thought otherwise For Wit if a Man had it unless it be directed to some useful End is but a wanton frivolous Quality all that one should value himself upon in this Kind is that he had some honourable In∣tention in it  As for this Point never Hero in Romance was carried away with a more furious Ambition to conquer Giants and Tyrants than I have been in extirpating Gamesters and Duellists And indeed like one of those Knights too though I was calm before I am apt to fly out again when the Thing that first disturbed me is presented to my Ima∣gination I shall therefore leave off when I am well and fight with Windmills no more Only shall be so Arrogant as to say of my self that in Spite of all the Force of Fashion and Prejudice in the Face of all the World I alone bewailed the Condition of an  English  Gentleman whose Fortune and Life are at this Day precarious while His Estate is liable to the Demands of Game∣sters through a false Sense of Justice and to the Demands of Duellists through a false Sense of Honour As to the First of these Orders of Men I have not one Word more to say of them As to the latter I shall conclude all I have more to offer aginst them with Respect to their being prompted by the Fear of Shame by applying to the Duellist what I think Dr  South  says somewhere of the Lyar  He is a Coward to Man and a Brave to God  THE N  o  TATLER  BY Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  VOL IV  Timeo Danaos Dona ferentes  Virg  From  Saturday June  to  Tuesday June    SheerLane  June  THERE are some Occasions in Life where∣in Regards to a Man's self is the most piti∣ful and contemptible of all Passions and such a Time certainly is when the true publick Spirit of a Nation is run into a Faction against their Friends and Benefactors I have hinted heretofore some Things which discover the real Sorrow I am in at the Observation that it is now very much so in  Great Britain  and have had the Honour to be pelted with several Epistles to expostulate with me on that Subject Among others one from a Person of the Number of those they call  Quakers  who seems to admonish me out of pure Zeal and Goodwill But as there is no Character so unjust as that of talking in Party upon all Occa∣sions without Respect to Merit or Worth on the  contrary Side so there is no Part we can act so justifiable as to speak our Mind when we see Things urged to Extremity against all that is Praiseworthy or valuable in Life upon general and groundless Suggestions But if I have talked too frankly upon such Reflections my Cor∣respondent has laid before me after his Way the Error of it in a Manner that makes me indeed thankful for his Kindness but the more inclina∣ble to repeat the Imprudence from the Necessity of the Circumstance  The d of the th Month which is the Month  June  Friend  Isaac  FOrasmuch as I love thee I cannot any lon∣ger refrain declaring my Mind unto thee concerning some Things Thou didst thy self indite the Epistle inserted in one of thy late Lucubrations as thou wouldst have us call them For verily thy Friend of Stone and I speak according to Knowledge hath no Fin∣gers and tho' he hath a Mouth yet speaketh he not therewith nor yet did that Epistle at all come unto thee from the Mansionhouse of the Scarlet Whore It is plain therefore that the Truth is not in thee But since thou wouldst lye couldst thou not lye with more Discretion Wherefore shouldst thou insult over the Af∣flicted or add Sorrow unto the Heavy of Heart Truly this Gall proceedeth not from the Spirit of Meekness I tell thee moreover the People of this Land be marvelously given to Change insomuch that it may lightly come to pass that before thou art many Years nearer to thy Disso∣lution thou mayst behold him sitting on a high Place whom thou now laughest to Scorn And then how wilt thou be glad to humble thy self to the Ground and lick the Dust of his Feet that thou mayst find Favour in his Sight If thou didst meditate as much upon the Word as  thou dost upon the prophane Scribblings of the wise Ones of this Generation thou wouldst have remembred what happened unto  Shimei  the Son of  Gera  the  Benjamite  who cursed the good Man  David  in his Distress  David  par∣doned his Transgression yet was he afterwards taken as in a Snare by the Words of his own Mouth and fell by the Sword of  Solomon  the chief Ruler Furthermore I do not remember to have heard in the Days of my Youth and Vanity when like thine my Conversation was with the Gentiles that the Men of  Rome  which is  Babylon  ever sued unto the Men of  Carthage  for Tranquility as thou dost aver Neither was  Hannibal  the Son of  Hamilcar  called Home by his Countrymen till these saw the Sword of their Enemies at their Gates And then was it not Time for him thinkest thou to return It appeareth therefore that thou dost prophesy backwards thou dost row one Way and look another and indeed in all Things art thou too much a Timeserver yet seemest thou not to consider what a Day may bring forth Think of this and take Tobacco  Thy Friend  Aminadab  If the zealous Writer of the above Letter has any Meaning it is of too high a Nature to be the Subject of my Lucubrations I shall therefore wave such high Points and be as useful as I can to Persons of less Moment than any he hints at When a Man runs into a little Fame in the World as he meets with a great deal of Reproach which he does not deserve so does he also a great deal of Esteem to which he has in himself no Pre∣tensions Were it otherwise I am sure no one would offer to put a LawCase to me But be∣cause I am an Adept in Physick and Astrology  they will needs perswade me that I am no less a Proficient in all other Sciences However the Point mentioned in the following Letter is so plain a one that I think I need not trouble my self to cast a Figure to be able to discuss it  Mr  Bickerstaff  IT is some Years ago since the Entail of the Estate of our Family was altered by passing a Fine in Favour of me who now am in Pos∣session of it after some others deceased The HeirsGeneral who live beyond Sea were ex∣cluded by this Settlement and the whole Estate is to pass in a new Channel after me and my Heirs But several Tenants of the Lordship perswade me to let them hereafter hold their Lands of me according to the old Customs of the Barony and not oblige them to act by the Limitations of the last Settlement This they say will make me more popular among my Departments and the ancient Vassals of the Estate to whom any Deviation from the Line of Succession is always invidious  Yours  c  SheerLane  June  SIR  YOU have by the Fine a plain Right in which none else of your Family can be your Competitor for which Reason by all Means demand Vassalage upon that Title The con∣trary Advice can be given for no other Purpose in Nature but to betray you and favour other Pretenders by making you place a Right which is in you only upon a Level with a Right which you have in common with others I am  SIR  Your most Faithful Servant till Death  I B  There is nothing so dangerous or so pleasing as Compliments made to us by our Enemies And my Correspondent tells me That though he knows several of those who give him this Coun∣sel were at first against passing the Fine in Favour of him yet is he so touched with their Homage to him that he can hardly believe they have a Mind to set it aside in order to introduce the HeirsGeneral into his Estate  These are great Evils but since there is no proceeding with Success in this World without complying with the Arts of it I shall use the same Method as my Correspondent's Tenants did with him in Relation to one whom I never had a Kindness for but shall notwithstanding pre∣sume to give him my Advice  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  of  Great Britain  to  Lewis  XIV of  France  SIR  YOUR Majesty will pardon me while I take the Liberty to acquaint you that some Passages written from your Side of the Water do very much obstruct your Interests We take it very unkindly that the Prints of  Paris  are so very partial in Favour of one Set of Men among us and treat the others as irrecon∣cileable to your Interests Your Writers are very large in recounting any Thing which re∣lates to the Figure and Power of one Party but are dumb when they should represent the Actions of the other This is a trifling Cir∣cumstance many here are apt to lay some Stress upon therefore I thought fit to offer it to your Consideration before you dispatch the next Courier  I B  The TATLER N  o    Propter Vitam vivendi perdere Causas  Juv  From  Tuesday June  to  Thursday June    From my own Apartment  June  OF all the Evils under the Sun that of ma∣king Vice commendable is the greatest For it seems to be the Basis of Society that Ap∣plause and Contempt should be always given to proper Objects But in this Age we behold Things for which we ought to have an Abhor∣rence not only received without Disdain but even valued as Motives of Emulation This is na∣turally the Destruction of Simplicity of Manners Openness of Heart and Generosity of Temper When one gives ones self the Liberty to range and run over in ones Thoughts the different Ge∣nius's of Men which one meets in the World one cannot but observe that most of the Indi∣rection and Artifice which is used among Men does not proceed so much from a Degeneracy in Nature as an Affectation of appearing Men of Consequence by such Practices By this Means it is that a cunning Man is so far from being ashamed of being esteemed such that he secretly rejoices in it It has been a Sort of Maxim That the greatest Art is to conceal Art but I know not how among some People we meet with their greatest Cunning is to appear cunning There is  Polypragmon  makes it the whole Business of his Life to be thought a cunning Fellow and thinks it a much greater Character to be terrible than agreeable When it has once enter'd into a Man's Head to have an Ambition to be thought crafty all other Evils are necessary Consequences To  deceive is the immediate Endeavour of him who is proud of the Capacity of doing it It is cer∣tain  Polypragmon  does all the Ill he possibly can but pretends to much more than he performs He is contented in his own Thoughts and hugs himself in his Closet that though he is locked up there and doing nothing the World does not know but that he is doing Mischief To favour this Suspicion he gives HalfLooks and Shrugs in his general Behaviour to give you to under∣stand that you don't know what he means He is also wonderfully adverbial in his Expressions and breaks off with a Perhaps and a Nod of the Head upon Matters of the most indifferent Na∣ture It is a mighty Practice with Men of this Genius to avoid frequent Appearance in Publick and to be as mysterious as possible when they do come into Company There is nothing to be done according to them the common Way and let the Matter in Hand be what it will it must be carried with an Air of Importance and trans∣acted if we may so speak with an ostentatious Secrecy These are your Persons of long Heads who would fain make the World believe their Thoughts and Idea's are very much superior to their Neighbours and do not value what these their Neighbours think of them provided they do not reckon them Fools These have such a Romantick Touch in Business that they hate to perform any Thing like other Men Were it in their Choice they had rather bring their Pur∣poses to bear by overreaching the Persons they deal with than by a plain and simple Manner They make Difficulties for the Honour of sur∣mounting them  Polypragmon  is eternally busied after this Manner with no other Prospect than that he is in Hopes to be thought the most cun∣ning of all Men and fears the Imputation of Want of Understanding much more than that of the Abuse of it But alas How contemptible is  such an Ambition which is the very Reverse of all that is truly laudable and the very Contra∣diction to the only Means to a just Reputation Simplicity of Manners Cunning can in no Cir∣cumstance imaginable be a Quality worthy a Man except in his own Defence and meerly to con∣ceal himself from such as are so and in such Cases it is no longer Craft but Wisdom The monstrous Affectation of being thought artful immediately kills all Thoughts of Humanity and Goodness and gives Men a Sense of the soft Affections and Impulses of the Mind which are imprinted in us for our mutual Advantage and Succour as of meer Weaknesses and Follies Ac∣cording to the Men of Cunning you are to put off the Nature of a Man as fast as you can and acquire that of a Daemon as if it were a more eligible Character to be a powerful Enemy than an able Friend But it ought to be a Mortifica∣tion to Men affected this Way that there wants but little more than Instinct to be considerable in it for when a Man has arrived at being very bad in his Inclination he has not much more to do but to conceal himself and he may revenge cheat and deceive without much Employment for Understanding and go on with great Chear∣fulness with the high Applause of being a prodi∣gious cunning Fellow But indeed when we ar∣rive at that Pitch of false Taste as not to think Cunning a contemptible Quality it is methinks a very great Injustice that Pickpockets are had in so little Veneration who must be admirably well turned not only for the Theoretick but al∣so the Practical Behaviour of cunning Fellows After all the Endeavour of this Family of Men whom we call cunning their whole Work falls to Pieces if others will lay down all Esteem for such Artifices and treat it as an unmanly Quali∣ty which they forbear to practise only because they abhor it When the Spider is ranging in  the different Apartments of his Web it is true that he only can weave so fine a Thread but it is in the Power of the meerest Drone that has Wings to fly through and destroy it  Will's Coffeehouse  June  Tho' the Taste of Wit and Pleasure is at pre∣sent but very low in this Town yet there are some that preserve their Relish undebauched with common Impressions and can distinguish between Reality and Imposture A Gentleman was saying here this Evening That he would go to the Play to Morrow Night to see Heroism as it has been represented by some of our Tragedians repre∣sented in Burlesque It seems the Play of  Alex∣ander  is to be then turned into Ridicule for its Bombast and other false Ornaments in the Thought as well as the Language The Bluster  Alexander  makes is as much inconsistent with the Character of an Hero as the Roughness of  Clytus  an Instance of the Sincerity of a bold art∣less Soldier To be plain is not to be rude but rather inclines a Man to Civility and Deference not indeed to show it in the Gestures of the Bo∣dy but in the Sentiments of the Mind It is among other Things from the impertinent Fi∣gures unskilful Dramatists draw of the Chara∣cters of Men that Youth are bewildered and pre∣judiced in their Sense of the World of which they have no Notions but what they draw from Books and such Representations Thus talk to a very young Man let him be of never so good Sense and he shall smile when you speak of Sin∣cerity in a Courtier good Sense in a Soldier or Honesty in a Politician The Reason of this is That you hardly see one Play wherein each of these Ways of Life is not drawn by Hands that know nothing of any one of them And the Truth is so far of the opposite Side to what they paint that it is more impracticable to live in Esteem in Courts than any where else without Sincerity Good  Sense is the great Requisite in a Soldier and Ho∣nesty the only Thing that can support a Politi∣cian This Way of Thinking made the Gentle∣man of whom I was just now speaking say He was glad any one had taken upon him to depre∣ciate such unnatural Fustian as the Tragedy of  Alexander  The Character of that Prince indeed was That he was unequal and given to Intem∣perance but in his sober Moments when he had warm in his Imagination the Precepts of his great Instructor he was a Pattern of generous Thoughts and Dispositions in Opposition to the strongest Desires which are incident to a Youth and Con∣queror But instead of representing that Hero in the glorious Character of Generosity and Chasti∣ty in his Treatment of the beauteous Family of  Darius  he is drawn all along as a Monster of Lust or of Cruelty as if the Way to raise him to the Degree of an Hero were to make his Cha∣racter as little like that of a worthy Man as pos∣sible Such rude and indigested Draughts of Things are the proper Objects of Ridicule and Contempt and depreciating  Alexander  as we have him drawn is the only Way of restoring him to what he was in himself It is well con∣trived of the Players to let this Part be followed by a true Picture of Life in the Comedy call'd  The Chances  wherein Don  John  and  Constantia  are acted to the utmost Perfection There need not be a greater Instance of the Force of Action than in many Incidents of this Play where indif∣ferent Passages and such that conduce only to the tacking of the Scenes together are enlivened with such an agreeable Gesture and Behaviour as apparently shows what a Play might be tho' it is not wholly what a Play should be  The TATLER N  o    Tecum vivere amem tecum obeam libens  Hor  From  Thursd June  to  Saturd July    From my own Apartment  June  SOme Years since I was engaged with a Coach full of Friends to take a Journey as far as the  Land'sEnd  We were very well pleased with one another the first Day every one endeavouring to recommend himself by his good Humour and Complaisance to the rest of the Company This good Correspondence did not last long one of our Party was sowred the very first Evening by a Plate of Butter which had not been melted to his Mind and which spoiled his Temper to such a Degree that he continued upon the Fret to the End of our Journey A Second fell off from his good Humour the next Morning for no other Reason that I could imagine but because I chanced to step into the Coach before him and place my self on the shady Side This however was but my own private Guess for he did not mention a Word of it nor indeed of any Thing else for Three Days following The rest of our Company held out very near half the Way when of a sudden Mr  Sprightly  fell asleep and in∣stead of endeavouring to divert and oblige us as he had hitherto done carried himself with an unconcerned careless drowzy Behaviour till we came to uur last Stage There were Three of us who still held up our Heads and did all we could to make our Journey agreeable but to my Shame be it spoken about Three Miles on this Side  Exeter  I was taken with an unaccountable  Fit of Sullenness that hung upon me for above Threescore Miles whether it were for Want of Respect or from an accidental Tread upon my Foot or from a foolish Maid's calling me  The old Gentleman  I cannot tell In short there was but one who kept his good Humour to the  Land'sEnd  There was another Coach that went along with us in which I likewise observed that there were many secret Jealousies Heartburnings and Ani∣mosities For when we joined Companies at Night I could not but take Notice that the Pas∣sengers neglected their own Company and stu∣died how to make themselves esteemed by us who were altogether Strangers to them till at length they grew so well acquainted with us that they liked us as little as they did one another When I reflect upon this Journey I often fancy it to be a Picture of Humane Life in Respect to the several Friendships Contracts and Alliances that are made and dissolved in the several Periods of it The most delightful and most lasting En∣gagements are generally those which pass between Man and Woman and yet upon what Trifles are they weakened or entirely broken Sometimes the Parties fly asunder even in the Midst of Courtship and sometimes grow cool in the very Honey Month Some separate before the First Child and some after the Fifth others continue good till Thirty others till Forty while some few whose Souls are of an happier Make and better fitted to one another travel on toge∣ther to the End of their Journey in a continual Intercourse of kind Offices and mutual Endear∣ments  When we therefore chuse our Companions for Life if we hope to keep both them and our selves in good Humour to the last Stage of it we must be extreamly careful in the Choice we make as well as in the Conduct on our own  Part When the Persons to whom we join our selves can stand an Examination and bear the Scrutiny when they mend upon our Acquain∣tance with them and discover new Beauties the more we search into their Characters our Love will naturally rise in Proportion to their Per∣fections  But because there are very few possessed of such Accomplishments of Body and Mind we ought to look after those Qualifications both in our selves and others which are indispensibly ne∣cessary towards this happy Union and which are in the Power of every one to acquire or at least to cultivate and improve These in my Opinion are Chearfulness and Constancy A chearful Temper joined with Innocence will make Beau∣ty attractive Knowledge delightful and Wit goodnatured It will lighten Sickness Poverty and Affliction convert Ignorance into an amia∣ble Simplicity and render Deformity it self agree∣able  Constancy is natural to Persons of even Tem∣pers and uniform Dispositions and may be ac∣quired by those of the greatest Fickleness Vio∣lence and Passion who consider seriously the Terms of Union upon which they come together the mutual Interest in which they are engaged with all the Motives that ought to incite their Tenderness and Compassion towards those who have their Dependance upon them and are em∣barked with them for Life in the same State of Happiness or Misery Constancy when it grows in the Mind upon Considerations of this Nature becomes a Moral Virtue and a kind of good Na∣ture that is not subject to any Change of Health Age Fortune or any of those Accidents which are apt to unsettle the best Dispositions that are founded rather in Constitution than in Reason Where such a Constancy as this is wanting the most enflamed Passion may fall away into Cold∣ness  and Indifference and the most melting Ten∣derness degenerate into Hatred and Aversion I shall conclude this Paper with a Story that is ve∣ry well known in the North of  England  About Thirty Years ago a PacketBoat that had several Passengers on Board was cast away upon a Rock and in so great Danger of sinking that all who were in it endeavoured to save themselves as well at they could though only those who could swim well had a bare Possibility of doing it Among the Passengers there were Two Women of Fashion who seeing themselves in such a disconsolate Condition begged of their Husbands not to leave them One of them chose rather to die with his Wife than to forsake her the other though he was moved with the ut∣most Compassion for his Wife told her That for the Good of their Children it was better one of them should live than both perish By a great Piece of good Luck next to a Miracle when one of our good Men had taken the last and long Farewel in order to save himself and the other held in his Arms the Person that was dearer to him than Life the Ship was preserved It is with a secret Sorrow and Vexation of Mind that I must tell the Sequel of the Story and let my Reader know that this faithful Pair who were ready to have died in each others Arms about Three Years after their Escape upon some tri∣fling Disgust grew to a Coldness at first and at length fell out to such a Degree that they left one another and parted for ever The other Couple lived together in an uninterrupted Friend∣ship and Felicity and what was remarkable the Husband whom the Shipwreck had like to have separated from his Wife died a few Months after her not being able to survive the Loss of her  I must confess there is something in the Changeableness and Inconstancy of Humane Na∣ture that very often both dejects and terrifies  me Whatever I am at present I tremble to think what I may be While I find this Principle in me How can I assure my self that I shall be always true to my God my Friend or my self In short without Constancy there is neither Love Friendship or Virtue in the World  The TATLER N  o    Qui didicit Patriae quid debeat quid Amicis  Quo sit Amore Parens quo Frater Amandus Hospes  Scribere Personae scit Convenientia cuique  Hor  From  Saturday July  to  Tuesday July    Will's Coffeehouse  July  I Have of late received many Epistles where∣in the Writers treat me as a mercenary Person for some late Hints concerning Matters which they think I should not have touched upon but for sordid Considerations It is apparent that my Motive could not be of that Kind for when a Man declares him self openly on one Side that Party will take no more Notice of him because he is sure and the Set of Men whom he declares against for the same Reason are violent against him Thus it is Folly in a PlainDealer to ex∣pect that either his Friends will reward him or his Enemies forgive him For which Reason I thought it was the shortest Way to Impartiality to put my self beyond further Hopes or Fears by declaring my self at a Time when the Dis∣pute is not about Persons and Parties but Things and Causes To relieve my self from the Vexa∣tion which naturally attends such Reflections I came hither this Evening to give my Thoughts  quite a new Turn and converse with Men of Pleasure and Wit rather than those of Business and Intrigue I had hardly entered the Room when I was accosted by Mr  Thomas Dogget  who desired my Favour in Relation to the Play which was to be acted for his Benefit on  Thursday  He pleased me in saying it was  The Old Batchelor  in which Comedy there is a necessary Circumstance observ'd by the Author which most other Poets either overlook or do not understand that is to say the Distinction of Characters It is very or∣dinary with Writers to indulge a certain Modesty of believing all Men as witty as themselves and making all the Persons of the Play speak the Sentiments of the Author without any Manner of Respect to the Age Fortune or Quality of him that is on the Stage Ladies talk like Rakes and Footmen make Similes But this Writer knows Men which makes his Plays reasonable Enter∣tainments while the Scenes of most others are like the Tunes between the Acts They are per∣haps agreeable Sounds but they have no Idea's affixed to them  Dogget  thanked me for my Vi∣sit to him in the Winter and after his Comick Manner spoke his Request with so arch a Leer that I promised the Drole I would speak to all my Acquaintance to be at his Play  Whatever the World may think of the Actors whether it be that their Parts have an Effect on their Lives or whatever it is you see a wonder∣ful Benevolence among them towards the Inte∣rests and Necessities of each other  Dogget  there∣fore would not let me go without delivering me a Letter from poor old  Downes  the Prompter wherein that Retainer to the Theatre desires my Advice and Assistance in a Matter of Concern to him I have sent him my private Opinion for his Conduct but the Stage and the State Af∣fairs being so much canvassed by Parties and Fa∣ctions I shall for some Time hereafter take Leave  of Subjects which relate to either of them and employ my Care in the Consideration of Matters which regard that Part of Mankind who live without interesting themselves with the Troubles or Pleasures of either However for a meer Notion of the present Posture of the Stage I shall give you the Letter at large as follows  July  Honoured Sir  FInding by divers of your late Papers that you are a Friend to the Profession of which I was many Years an unworthy Member I the rather make bold to crave your Advice touch∣ing a Proposal that has been lately made me of coming again into Business and the SubAdmini∣stration of Stage Affairs I have from my Youth been bred up behind the Curtain and been a Prompter from the Time of the Restoration I have seen many Changes as well of Scenes as of Actors and have known Men within my Remembrance arrive to the highest Dignities of the Theatre who made their Entrance in the Quality of Mutes Jointstools Flowerpots and Tapestry Hangings It cannot be unknown to the Nobility and Gentry That a Gentleman of the Inns of Court and a deep Intriguer had some Time since worked himself into the sole Management and Direction of the Theatre Nor is it less notorious That his restless Am∣bition and subtle Machinations did manifestly tend to the Extirpation of the good old  British  Actors and the Introduction of foreign Pre∣tenders such as Harlequins  French  Dancers and  Roman  Singers which though they impo∣verish'd the Proprietors and imposed on the Audience were for some Time tolerated by Reason of his dextrous Insinuations which pre∣vailed upon a few deluded Women especially the Vizard Masks to believe that the Stage was in Danger But his Schemes were soon  exposed and the Great Ones that supported him withdrawing their Favour he made his Exit and remained for a Season in Obscurity During this Retreat the Machiavilian was not idle but secretly fomented Divisions and wrought over to his Side some of the inferior Actors reserving a Trap Door to himself to which only he had a Key This Entrance se∣cured this cunning Person to compleat his Company bethought himself of calling in the most eminent of Strollers from all Parts of the Kingdom I have seen them all ranged toge∣ther behind the Scenes but they are many of them Persons that never trod the Stage before and so very aukward and ungainly that it is impossible to believe the Audience will bear them He was looking over his Catalogue of Plays and indeed picked up a good tolerable Set of grave Faces for Counsellors to appear in the famous Scene of  Venice Preserv'd  when the Danger is over but they being but meer Outsides and the Actors having a great Mind to play  The Tempest  there is not a Man of them when he is to perform any Thing above Dumb Show is capable of acting with a good Grace so much as the Part of  Trincalo  However the Master persists in his Design and is fitting up the old Storm but I am afraid he will not be able to procure able Sailors or experienced Offi∣cers for Love or Money  Besides all this when he comes to cast the Parts there is so great a Confusion amongst them for Want of proper Actors that for my Part I am wholly discouraged The Play with which they design to open is  The Duke and no Duke  and they are so put to it that the Master him∣self is to act the Conjurer and they have no one for the General but honest  George Powell  Now Sir they being so much at a Loss for the  Dramatis Personae viz  the Persons to enact  and the whole Frame of the House being de∣signed to be altered I desire your Opinion whether you think it advisable for me to un∣dertake to prompt 'em For though I can clash Swords when they represent a Battle and have yet Lungs enough left to huzza their Victo∣ries I question if I should prompt 'em right whether they would act accordingly I am  Your Honour's most humble Servant  J Downes  P S  Sir Since I writ this I am credibly in∣formed That they design a new House in  Lin∣colnsInnFields  near the Popish Chapel to be ready by  Michaelmas  next which indeed is but repairing an old one that has already failed You know the honest Man who kept the Office is gone already  The TATLER N  o    Militat omnis amans  Ovid  From  Tuesday July  to  Thursday July    From my own Apartment  July  I Was this Morning reading the Tenth Canto in the Fourth Book of  Spencer  in which Sir  Scudamore  relates the Progress of his Courtship to  Amoret  under a very beautiful Allegory which is one of the most natural and unmixed of any in that most excellent Author I shall transprose it to use Mr  Bays  's Term for the Benefit of many  English  Lovers who have by frequent Let∣ters desired me to lay down some Rules for the Conduct of their virtuous Amours and shall  only premise That by the Shield of Love  meant a generous constant Passion for the Per¦son beloved  When the Fame says he of this celebrated Beauty first flew Abroad I went in Pursuit of her to the  Temple of Love  This Temple continues he bore the Name of the Goddess  Venus  and was seated in a most fruitful Island walled by Nature against all Invaders There was a single Bridge that led into the Island and before it a Castle garrison'd by Twenty Knights Near the Castle was an open Plain and in the midst of it a Pillar on which was hung the Shield of Love and underneath it in Letters of Gold was this Inscription  Happy the Man who well can use his Bliss  Whose ever be the Shield Fair  Amoret  be his  My Heart panted upon reading the Inscription I struck upon the Shield with my Spear Imme∣diately issued forth a Knight well mounted and compleatly armed who without speaking ran fiercely at me I received him as well as I could and by good Fortune threw him out of the Sad∣dle I encountered the whole Twenty succes∣sively and leaving them all extended on the Plain carried off the Shield in Token of Victo∣ry Having thus vanquish'd my Rivals I passed on without Impediment till I came to the outer∣most Gate of the Bridge which I found locked and barred I knocked and called but could get no Answer At last I saw one on the other Side of the Gate who stood peeping through a small Crevice This was the Porter he had a double Face resembling a  Janus  and was continually looking about him as if he mistrusted some sud∣den Danger His Name as I afterwards learn∣ed was  Doubt  Overagainst him sat  Delay  who entertained Passengers with some idle Story while they lost such Opportunities as were never  to be recovered As soon as the Porter saw my Shield he opened the Gate but upon my en∣tring  Delay  caught hold of me and would fain have made me listen to her Fooleries However I shook her off and passed forward till I came to the Second Gate  The Gate of good Desert  which always stood wide open but in the Porch was an hideous Giant that stop'd the Entrance His Name was  Danger  Many Warriors of good Reputation not able to bear the Sternness of his Look went back again Cowards fled at the first Sight of him except some few who watch∣ing their Opportunity slipt by him unobserv'd I prepared to assault him but upon the first Sight of my Shield he immediately gave Way Look∣ing back upon him I found his hinder Parts much more deformed and terrible than his Face  Hatred Murther Treason Envy  and  Detraction  lying in Ambush behind him to fall upon the Heedless and Unwary  I now entered  The Island of Love  which ap∣peared in all the Beauties of Art and Nature and feasted every Sense with the most agreeable Objects Amidst a pleasing Variety of Walks and Allies shady Seats and flowry Banks sun∣ny Hills and gloomy Valleys were Thousands of Lovers sitting or walking together in Pairs and singing Hymns to the Deity of the Place  I could not forbear envying this happy People who were already in Possession of all they could desire While I went forward to the Temple the Structure was beautiful beyond Imagination The Gate stood open In the Entrance sat a most amiable Woman whose Name was  Concord  On either Side of her stood Two young Men both strongly armed as if afraid of each other As I afterwards learned they were both her Sons but begotten of her by Two different Fathers their Names  Love  and  Hatred  The Lady so well tempered and reconciled them both that she forced them to join Hands tho' I could not but observe that  Hatred  turned aside his Face as not able to endure the Sight of his younger Brother  I at length entered the Inmost Temple the Roof of which was raised upon an Hundred Marble Pillars decked with Crowns Chains and Garlands The Ground was strowed with Flowers An Hundred Altars at each of which stood a Virgin Priestess cloathed in White blazed all at once with the Sacrifice of Lovers who were perpetually sending up their Vows to Hea∣ven in Clouds of Incense  In the Midst stood the Goddess her self upon an Altar whose Substance was neither Gold nor Stone but infinitely more precious than either About her Neck flew numberless Flocks of little  Loves Joys  and  Graces  and all about her Altar lay scattered Heaps of  Lovers  complaining of the Disdain Pride or Treachery of their Mistresses One among the rest no longer able to contain his Griefs broke out into the following Prayer  '  Venus  Queen of Grace and Beauty Joy of Gods and Men who with a Smile becalmest the Seas and renewest all Nature Goddess whom all the different Species in the Universe obey with Joy and Pleasure grant I may at last obtain the Object of my Vows'  The impatient Lover pronounced this with great Vehemence but I in a soft Murmur be∣sought the Goddess to lend me her Assistance While I was thus praying I chanced to cast my Eye on a Company of Ladies who were assem∣bled together in a Corner of the Temple waiting for the Anthem  The foremost seemed something elder and of a more composed Countenance than the rest who all appeared to be under her Direction Her Name was  Womanhood  On one Side of her sat  Shamefacedness  with Blushes rising in her Cheeks and her Eyes fixed upon the Ground On the o∣ther was  Chearfulness  with a smiling Look that infused a secret Pleasure into the Hearts of all that saw her With these sat  Modesty  holding her Hand on her Heart  Courtesie  with a grace∣ful Aspect and obliging Behaviour and the Two Sisters who were always linked together and resembled each other  Silence  and  Obedience  Thus sat they all around in seemly Rate  And in the Midst of them a goodly Maid  Ev'n in the Lap of  Womanhood  there sate  The which was all in Lillywhite array'd  Where Silver Streams among the Linen stray'd  Like to the Morn when first her shining Face  Hath to the Gloomy World it self bewray'd  That same was fairest  Amoret  in Place  Shining with Beauty's Light and Heav'nly Vir∣tue's Grace  As soon as I beheld the charming  Amoret  my Heart throbbed with Hopes I stepped to her and seized her Hand when  Womanhood  imme∣diately rising up sharply rebuked me for offer∣ing in so rude a Manner to lay hold on a Virgin I excused my self as modestly as I could and at the same Time displayed my Shield upon which as soon as she beheld the God emblazoned with his Bow and Shafts she was struck mute and instantly retired  I still held fast the fair  Amoret  and turning my Eyes towards the Goddess of the Place saw that she favoured my Pretensions with a Smile which so emboldened me that I carried off my Prize  The Maid sometimes with Tears sometimes with Smiles entreated me to let her go But I led her through the TempleGate where the Goddess  Concord  who had favoured my Entrance befriended my Retreat  This Allegory is so natural that it explains it self The Persons in it are very artfully descri∣bed and disposed in proper Places The Posts assigned to  Doubt Delay  and  Danger  are admi∣rable The Gate of  Good Desert  has something noble and instructive in it But above all I am most pleased with the beautiful Grouppe of Fi∣gures in the Corner of the Temple Among these  Womanhood  is drawn like what the Philo∣sophers call an Universal Nature and is attended with beautiful Representatives of all those Vir∣tues that are the Ornaments of the Female Sex considered in its natural Perfection and Inno∣cence  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd July  to  Saturd July    Grecian Coffeehouse  July  THE Learned World are very much offend∣ed at many of my Ratiocinations and have but a very mean Opinion of me as a Politician The Reason of this is That some erroneously conceive a Talent for Politicks to consist in the Regard to a Man's own Interest but I am of quite another Mind and think the first and essen∣tial Quality towards being a Statesman is to have a publick Spirit One of the Gentlemen who are out of Humour with me imputes my falling into a Way wherein I am so very aukward to a Barrenness of Invention and has the Charity to lay new Matter before me for the future He is at the Bottom my Friend but is at a Loss to know whether I am a Fool or a Physician and is pleased to expostulate with me with Relation to the latter He falls heavy upon Licentiates and seems to point more particularly at us who are  not regularly of the Faculty But since he has been so civil to me as to meddle only with those who are employed no further than about Men's Lives and not reflected upon me as of the Astro∣logical Sect who concern our selves about Lives and Fortunes also I am not so much hurt as to stifle any Part of his fond Letter  SIR  I Am afraid there is something in the Suspi∣cions of some People that you begin to be short of Matter for your Lucubrations Tho' several of them now and then did appear some∣what dull and insipid to me I was always cha∣ritably inclined to believe the Fault lay in my self and that I wanted the true Key to unci∣pher your Mysteries and remember your Ad∣vertisement upon this Account But since I have seen you fall in an unpardonable Error yea with a Relapse I mean since I have seen you turn Politician in the present unhappy Dis∣sentions I have begun to stagger and could not chuse but lessen the great Value I had for the Censor of our Isle How is it possible that a Man whom Interest did naturally lead to a constant Impartiality in these Matters and who hath Wit enough to judge that his Opinion was not like to make many Proselytes How is it possible I say that a little Passion for I have still too good an Opinion of you to think you was bribed by the Staggering Party could blind you so far as to offend the very better half of the Nation and to lessen off so much the Number of your Friends Mr  Morphew  will not have Cause to thank you unless you give over and endeavour to regain what you have lost There is still a great many Themes you have left untouched such as the ill Manage∣ments of Matters relating to Law and Physick the setting down Rules for knowing the Quacks  in both Professions What a large Field is there left in discovering the Abuses of the College who had a Charter and Privileges granted them to hinder the creeping in and prevailing of Quacks and Pretenders and yet grant Licences to Barbers and write Letters of Recommenda∣tion in the Country Towns out of the Reach of their Practice in Favour of meer Boys va∣luing the Health and Lives of their Country∣men no farther than they get Money by them You have said very little or nothing about the Dispensation of Justice in Town and Country where Clerks are the Counsellors to their Ma∣sters  But as I can't expect that the Censor of  Great Britain  should publish a Letter wherein he is censured with too much Reason himself yet I hope you will be the better for it and think upon the Themes I have mentioned which must certainly be of greater Service to the World your self and Mr  Morphew  than to let us know whether you are a  Whig  or a  Tory  I am still  Your Admirer and Servant  Cato Junior  This Gentleman and I differ about the Words Staggering and Better Part but instead of an∣swering to the Particulars of this Epistle I shall only acquaint my Correspondent That I am at present forming my Thoughts upon the Founda∣tion of Sir  Scudamore  's Progress in  Spencer  which has led me from all other Amusements to consi∣der the State of Love in this Island and from the Corruptions in the Government of that to deduce the chief Evils of Life In the mean Time that I am thus employed I have given po∣sitive Orders to Don  Saltero  of  Chelsea  the ToothDrawer and Dr  Thomas Smith  the CornCutter of  Kingstreet Westminster  who have the Mo∣desty  to confine their Pretensions to Manual Ope∣rations to bring me in with all convenient Speed compleat Lists of all who are but of equal Learning with themselves and yet administer Physick beyond the Feet and Gums These Ad∣vices I shall reserve for my future Leisure but have now taken a Resolution to dedicate the re∣maining Part of this Instant  July  to the Service of the Fair Sex and have almost finished a Scheme for settling the whole Remainder of that Sex who are unmarried and above the Age of Twen∣ty five  In order to this good and publick Service I shall consider the Passion of Love in its full Ex∣tent as it is attended both with Joys and Inquie∣tudes and lay down for the Conduct of my Lovers such Rules as shall banish the Cares and heighten the Pleasures which flow from that amiable Spring of Life and Happiness There is no less than an absolute Necessity that some Pro∣vision be made to take off the dead Stock of Wo∣men in City Town and Country Let there happen but the least Disorder in the Streets and in an Instant you see the Inequality of the Num∣bers of Males and Females Besides that the Feminine Crowd on such Occasions is more nu∣merous in the open Way you may observe them also to the very Garrets huddled together Four at least at a Casement Add to this that by an exact Calculation of all that have come to Town by StageCoach or Waggon for this Twelvemonth last Three Times in Four the treated Persons have been Males This overstock of Beauty for which there are so few Bidders calls for an im∣mediate Supply of Lovers and Husbands and I am the studious KnightErrant who have suffer'd long Nocturnal Contemplations to find out Me∣thods for the Relief of all  British  Females who at present seem to be devoted to involuntary Vir∣ginity The Scheme upon which I design to act  I have communicated to none but a beauteous young Lady who has for some Time left the Town in the following Letter  To  Amanda  in  Kent  MADAM  I Send with this my Discourse of Ways and Means for encouraging Marriage and re∣peopling the Island You will soon observe that according to these Rules the mean Consi∣derations which make Beauty and Merit cease to be the Objects of Love and Courtship will be fully exploded I have unanswerably pro∣ved that Jointures and Settlements are the Bane of Happiness and not only so but the Ruin even of their Fortunes who enter into them I beg of you therefore to come to Town upon the Receipt of this where I pro∣mise you you shall have as many Lovers as Toasters for there needed nothing but to make Men's Interests fall in with their Inclinations to render you the most courted of your Sex As many as love you will now be willing to marry you Hasten then and be the honoura∣ble Mistress of Mankind  Cassander  and many others stand in  the Gate of Good Descrt  to re∣ceive you I am  MADAM  Your most Obedient Most Humble Servant  Isaac Bickerstaff  The TATLER N  o    Dulcis inexperto cultura potentis Amici  Expertus metuit  Hor  From  Saturd July  to  Tuesd July    From my own Apartment  July  THE intended Course of my Studies was al∣tered this Evening by a Visit from an old Acquaintance who complained to me mention∣ing one upon whom he had long depended that he found his Labour and Perseverance in his Pa∣tron's Service and Interests wholly ineffectual and he thought now after his best Years were spent in a professed Adherence to him and his Fortunes he should in the End be forced to break with him and give over all further Ex∣pectations from him He sighed and ended his Discourse by saying  'You Mr Censor some Time ago gave us your Thoughts of the Beha∣viour of great Men to their Creditors'  This Sort of Demand upon them for what they invite Men to expect is a Debt of Honour which ac∣cording to Custom they ought to be most care∣ful of paying and would be a very worthy Sub∣ject for a Lucubration  Of all Men living I think I am the most pro∣per to treat of this Matter because in the Cha∣racter and Employment of Censor I have had Encouragement so infinitely above my Desert that what I say cannot possibly be supposed to arise from Peevishness or any Disappointment in that Kind which I my self have met with When we consider Patrons and their Clients those who receive Addresses and those who are  addressed to it must not be understood that the Dependants are such as are worthless in their Natures abandoned to any Vice or Dishonour or such as without a Call thrust themselves upon Men in Power nor when we say Patrons do we mean such as have it not in their Power or have no Obligation to assist their Friends but we speak of such Leagues where there are Power and Obligation on the one Part and Merit and Expectation on the other Were we to be very particular on this Subject I take it that the Di∣vision of Patron and Client may include a Third Part of our Nation The Want of Merit and real Worth will strike out about Ninety nine in the Hundred of these and Want of Ability in the Patron will dispose of as many of that Or∣der He who out of meer Vanity to be applied to will take up another's Time and Fortune in his Service where he has no Prospect of returning it is as much more unjust as those who took up my Friend the Upholder's Goods without paying him for them I say he is much more unjust as our Life and Time is more valuable than our Goods and Moveables Among many whom you see about the Great there is a contented well∣pleased Set who seem to like the Attendance for its own Sake and are early at the Abodes of the powerful out of meer Fashion This Sort of Vanity is as well grounded as if a Man should lay aside his own plain Suit and dress himself up in a gay Livery of anothers  There are many of this Species who exclude others of just Expectation and make those pro∣per Dependants appear impatient because they are not so chearful as those who expect nothing I have made use of the PennyPost for the In∣struction of these voluntary Slaves and informed them that they will never be provided for but they double their Diligence upon Admonition  Will Afterday  has told his Friends that he was  to have the next Thing these Ten Years and  Harry Linger  has been Fourteen within a Month of a considerable Office However the fanta∣stick Complaisance which is paid to them may blind the Great from seeing themselves in a just Light they must needs if they in the least re∣flect at some Times have a Sense of the Injustice they do in raising in others a false Expectation But this is so common a Practice in all the Stages of Power that there are not more Cripples come out of the Wars than from the Attendance of Patrons You see in one a settled Melancholy in another a bridled Rage a Third has lost his Memory and a Fourth his whole Constitution and Humour In a Word when you see a par∣ticular Cast of Mind or Body which looks a lit∣tle upon the Distracted you may be sure the poor Gentleman has formerly had great Friends For this Reason I have thought it a prudent Thing to take a Nephew of mine out of a Ladies Service where he was a Page and have bound him to a Shoemaker  But what of all the Humours under the Sun is the most pleasant to consider is That you see some Men lay as it were a Set of Acquaintance by them to converse with when they are out of Employment who had no Effect of their Power when they were in Here Patrons and Clients both make the most fantastical Figure imagina∣ble Friendship indeed is most manifested in Adversity but I do not know how to behave my self to a Man who thinks me his Friend at no other Time but that  Dick Reptile  of our Club had this in his Head t'other Night when he said I am afraid of ill News when I am visited by any of my old Friends These Patrons are a little like some fine Gentlemen who spend all their Hours of Gaiety with their Wenches but when they fall sick will let no one come near them but their Wives It seems Truth and Honour  are Companions too sober for Prosperity It is certainly the most black Ingratitude to accept of a Man's best Endeavours to be pleasing to you and return it with Indifference  I am so much of this Mind that  Dick Eastcourt  the Comedian for coming one Night to our Club tho' he laughed at us all the Time he was there shall have our Company at his Play on  Thursday  A Man of Talents is to be favoured or never admitted Let the ordinary World truck for Money and Wares but Men of Spirit and Conversation should in every Kind do others as much Pleasure as they receive from them But Men are so taken up with outward Forms that they do not consider their Actions else how should it be that a Man shall deny that to the Entreaties and almost Tears of an old Friend which he shall solicit a new one to accept of I remember when I first came out of  Staffordshire  I had an Intimacy with a Man of Quality in whose Gift there fell a very good Employment All the Town cry'd There's a Thing for Mr  Bick∣erstaff  When to my great Astonishment I found my Patron had been forced upon Twenty Artifices to surprize a Man with it who never thought of it But sure it is a Degree of Murder to amuse Men with vain Hopes If a Man takes away another's Life where is the Difference whether he does it by taking away the Minutes of his Time or the Drops of his Blood But in∣deed such as have Hearts barren of Kindness are served accordingly by those whom they employ and pass their Lives away with an empty Shew of Civility for Love and an insipid Intercourse of a Commerce in which their Affections are no way concerned But on the other Side How beauti∣ful is the Life of a Patron who performs his Du∣ty to his Inferiors A worthy Merchant who employs a Crowd of Artificers A great Lord who is generous and merciful to the several Ne∣cessities  of his Tenants A Courtier who uses his Credit and Power for the Welfare of his Friends These have in their several Stations a quick Relish of the exquisite Pleasure of doing Good In a Word good Patrons are like the Guardian Angels of  Plato  who are ever busy though unseen in the Care of their Wards but ill Patrons are like the Deities of  Epicurus  su∣pine indolent and unconcerned though they see Mortals in Storms and Tempests even while they are offering Incense to their Power  The TATLER N  o    Semper ego Auditor tantum  Juv  From  Tuesday July  to  Thursday July    Grecian Coffeehouse  July  WHEN I came hither this Evening the Man of the House delivered me a Book very finely bound When I received it I over∣heard one of the Boys whisper another and say It was a fine Thing to be a great Scholar What a pretty Book that is It has indeed a very gay Outside and is dedicated to me by a very inge∣nious Gentleman who does not put his Name to it The Title of it for the Work is in  Latin  is  Epistolarum Obscurorum Virorum ad Dm M Or∣tuinum Gratium Volumina  II  c  "The Epi∣stles of the Obscure Writers to  Ortuinus c  " The Purpose of the Work is signified in the Dedi∣cation in very elegant Language and fine Rail∣lery It seems this is a Collection of Letters which some profound Blockheads who lived be∣fore our Times have written in Honour of each  other and for their mutual Information in each others Absurdities They are mostly of the  Ger∣man  Nation whence from Time to Time Inun∣dations of Writers have flow'd more pernicious to the Learned World than the Swarms of  Goths  and  Vandals  to the Politick It is methinks wonderful that Fellows could be awake and utter such incoherent Conceptions and converse with great Gravity like learned Men without the least Tast of Knowledge or good Sense It would have been an endless Labour to have ta∣ken any other Method of exposing such Imperti∣nencies than by an Edition of their own Works where you see their Follies according to the Am∣bition of such Virtuosi in a most correct Edition  Looking over these accomplish'd Labours I could not but reflect upon the immense Load of Writings which the Commonalty of Scholars have pushed into the World and the Absurdity of Parents who educate Crowds to spend their Time in Pursuit of such cold and sprightless En∣deavours to appear in Publick It seems there∣fore a fruitless Labour to attempt the Correction of the Tast of our Contemporaries except it was in our Power to burn all the senseless La∣bours of our Ancestors There is a secret Pro∣pensity in Nature from Generation to Generation in the Blockheads of one Age to admire those of another and Men of the same Imperfections are as great Admirers of each other as those of the same Abilities  This great Mischief of voluminous Follies pro∣ceeds from a Misfortune which happens in all Ages that Men of barren Genius's but fertile Imaginations are bred Scholars This may at first appear a Paradox but when we consider the talking Creatures we meet in publick Places it will no longer be such  Ralph Shallow  is a young Fellow that has not by Nature any the least Pro∣pensity to strike into what has not been observed  and said every Day of his Life by others but with that Inability of speaking any Thing that is uncommon he has a great Readiness at what he can speak of and his Imagination runs into all the different Views of the Subject he treats of in a Moment If  Ralph  had Learning added to the common ChitChat of the Town he would have been a Disputant upon all Topicks that ever were considered by Men of his own Genius As for my Part I never am teazed by an empty TownFellow but I bless my Stars that he was not bred a Scholar This Addition we must consider would have made him capable of maintaining his Follies His being in the Wrong would have been protected by suitable Arguments and when he was hedged in by Logical Terms and false Appearances you must have owned your self convinced before you could then have got rid of him and the Shame of his Triumph had been ad∣ded to the Pain of his Impertinence  There is a Sort of Littleness in the Minds of Men of wrong Sense which makes them much more insufferable than meer Fools and has the further Inconvenience of being attended by an endless Loquacity For which Reason it would be a very proper Work if some Wellwisher to humane Society would consider the Terms upon which People meet in publick Places in order to prevent the unseasonable Declamations which we meet with there I remember in my Youth it was an Humour at the University when a Fel∣low pretended to be more eloquent than ordinary and had formed to himself a Plot to gain all our Admiration or triumph over us with an Argu∣ment to either of which he had no Manner of Call I say in either of these Cases it was the Humour to shut one Eye This whimsical Way of taking Notice to him of his Absurdity has prevented many a Man from being a Coxcomb If amongst us on such an Occasion each Man of∣fered  a voluntary Rhetorician some Snuff it would probably produce the same Effect As the Matter now stands whether a Man will or no he is obliged to be informed in whatever another pleases to entertain him with tho' the Preceptor makes these Advances out of Vanity and not to instruct but insult him  There is no Man will allow him who wants Courage to be called a Soldier but Men who want good Sense are very frequently not only al∣lowed to be Scholars but esteemed for being such At the same Time it must be granted that as Courage is the natural Parts of a Soldier so is a good Understanding of a Scholar Such little Minds as these whose Productions are collected in the Volume to which I have the Honour to be Patron are the Instruments for artful Men to work with and become popular with the un∣thinking Part of Mankind In Courts they make transparent Flatterers in Camps ostentatious Bullies in Colleges unintelligible Pedants and their Faculties are used accordingly by those who lead them  When a Man who wants Judgment is admitted into the Conversation of reasonable Men he shall remember such improper Circumstances and draw such groundless Conclusions from their Discourse and that with such Colour of Sense as would divide the best Set of Company that can be got together It is just thus with a Fool who has a Familiarity with Books he shall quote and recite one Author against another in such a Man∣ner as shall puzzle the best Understanding to re∣fute him tho' the most ordinary Capacity may ob∣serve that it is only Ignorance which makes the Intricacy All the true Use of that we call Learn∣ing is to ennoble and improve our natural Fa∣culties and not to disguise our Imperfections It is therefore in vain for Folly to attempt to conceal it self by the Refuge of Learned Languages Li∣terature  does but make a Man more eminently the Thing which Nature made him and  Poly∣glottes  had he studied less than he has and writ only in his Mother Tongue had been known on∣ly in  Great Britain  for a Pedant  Mr  Bickerstaff  thanks  Dorinda  and will both answer her Letter and take her Advice  The TATLER N  o    Quale sit id quod amas celeri circumspice Mente  Et tua caesura substrahe Colla Jugo  Hor  From  Thursday July  to  Saturday July    From my own Apartment  July  The History of  Caelia  IT is not necessary to look back into the First Years of this young Lady whose Story is of Consequence only as her Life has lately met with Passages very uncommon She is now in the Twentieth Year of her Age and owes a strict but chearful Education to the Care of an Aunt to whom she was recommended by her dying Fa∣ther whose Decease was hastened by an incon∣solable Affliction for the Loss of her Mother As  Caelia  is the Offspring of the most generous Pas∣sion that has been known in our Age she is adorned with as much Beauty and Grace as the most celebrated of her Sex possess but her Do∣mestick Life moderate Fortune and religious Educaiton gave her but little Opportunity and less Inclination to be admired in publick Assem∣blies Her Abode has been for some Years a con∣venient Distance from the Cathedral of St  Paul  's  where her Aunt and she chose to reside for the Advantage of that rapturous Way of Devotion which gives Extasy to the Pleasures of Innocence and in some Measure is the immediate Posses∣sion of those Heavenly Enjoyments for which they are addressed  As you may trace the usual Thoughts of Men in their Countenances there appeared in the Face of  Caelia  a Chearfulness the constant Companion of unaffected Virtue and a Gladness which is as inseparable from true Piety Her every Look and Motion spoke the peaceful mild resigning humble Inhabitant that animated her beauteous Body Her Air discovered her Body a meer Ma∣chine of her Mind and not that her Thoughts were employed in studying Graces and Attractions for her Person Such was  Caelia  when she was first seen by  Palamede  at her usual Place of Wor∣ship  Palamede  is a young Man of Two and twenty wellfashioned learned genteel and dis∣creet the Son and Heir of a Gentleman of a very great Estate and himself possessed of a plenti∣ful one by the Gift of an Unkle He became enamoured with  Caelia  and after having learned her Habitation had Address enough to commu∣nicate his Passion and Circumstances with such an Air of good Sense and Integrity as soon obtain'd Permission to visit and profess his Inclinations to∣wards her  Palamede  's present Fortune and fu∣ture Expectations were no Way prejudicial to his Addresses but after the Lovers had passed some Time in the agreeable Entertainments of a suc∣cessful Courtship  Caelia  one Day took Occasion to interrupt  Palamede  in the Midst of a very plea∣sing Discourse of the Happiness he promised him∣self in so accomplished a Companion and as∣suming a serious Air told him there was another Heart to be won before he gained hers which was that of his Father  Palamede  seemed much disturbed at the Overture and lamented to her  That his Father was one of those too provident Pa∣rents who only place their Thoughts upon bring∣ing Riches into their Families by Marriages and are wholly insensible of all other Considerations But the Strictness of  Caelia  's Rules of Life made her insist upon this Demand and the Son at a proper Hour communicated to his Father the Circumstances of his Love and the Merit of the Object The next Day the Father made her a Visit The Beauty of her Person the Fame of her Virtue and a certain irresistible Charm in her whole Behaviour on so tender and delicate an Oc∣casion wrought so much upon him in Spight of all Prepossessions that he hastened the Marriage with an Impatience equal to that of his Son Their Nuptials were celebrated with a Privacy suitable to the Character and Modesty of  Caelia  and from that Day till a fatal one of last Week they lived together with all the Joy and Happi∣ness which attend Minds entirely united  It should have been intimated That  Palamede  is a Student of the  Temple  and usually retired thi∣ther early in a Morning  Caelia  still sleeping  It happened a few Days since that she followed him thither to communicate to him something she had omitted in her redundant Fondness to speak of the Evening before When she came to his Apart∣ment the Servant there told her she was coming with a Letter to her While  Caelia  in an Inner Room was reading an Apology from her Husband That he had been suddenly taken by some of his Acquaintance to dine at  Brentford  but that he should return in the Evening a Country Girl de∣cently clad asked If those were not the Cham∣bers of Mr  Palamede  She was answered They were but that he was not in Town The Stranger asked When he was expected at Home The Ser∣vant replied She would go in and ask his Wife The young Woman repeated the Word Wife and fainted This Accident rais'd no less Curiosity  when Amazement in  Caelia  who caused her to be removed into the Inner Room Upon proper Ap∣plications to revive her the unhappy young Crea∣ture returned to her self and said to  Caelia  with an earnest and beseeching Tone Are you really Mr  Palamede  's Wife  Caelia  replies I hope I do not look as if I were any other in the Condition you see me The Stranger answers No Madam he is my Husband At the same Instant she threw a Bundle of Letters into  Caelia  's Lap which con∣firmed the Truth of what she asserted Their mu∣tual Innocence and Sorrow made them look at each other as Partners in Distress rather than Rivals in Love The Superiority of  Caelia  's Un∣derstanding and Genius gave her an Authority to examine into this Adventure as if she had been offended against and the other the Delinquent The Stranger spoke in the following Manner  Madam  If it shall please you Mr  Palamede  having an Unkle of a good Estate near  Winchester  was bred at the School there to gain the more his good Will by being in his Sight His Unkle died and left him the Estate which my Husband now has When he was a meer Youth he set his Affections on me but when he could not gain his Ends he married me making me and my Mother who is a Farmer's Widow swear we would never tell it upon any Account whatsoever for that it would not look well for him to marry such a one as me besides that his Father would cut him off of the Estate I was glad to have him in an honest Way and he now and then came and stay'd a Night and away at our House But very lately he came down to see us with a fine young Gentleman his Friend who stay'd behind there with us pretending to like the Place for the Summer but ever since Master  Palamede  went he has attempted to abuse me  and I ran hither to acquaint him with it and avoid the wicked Intentions of his false Friend  Caelia  had no more Room for Doubt but left her Rival in the same Agonies she felt her self  Palamede  returns in the Evening and finding his Wife at his Chambers learned all that had pas∣sed and hastened to  Caelia  's Lodgings  It is much easier to imagine than express the Sentiments of either the Criminal or the Injured at this Encounter  Assoon as  Palamede  had found Way for Speech he confessed his Marriage and his placing his Companion on Purpose to vitiate his Wife that he might break through a Marriage made in his Nonage and devote his riper and knowing Years to  Caelia  She made him no Answer but retired to her Closet He returned to the  Temple  where he soon after received from her the following Letter  SIR  YOU who this Morning were the best are now the worst of Men who beath vital Air I am at once overwhelmed with Love Hatred Rage and Disdain Can Infamy and Innocence live to∣gether I feel the Weight of the one too strong for the Comfort of the other How bitter Heaven how bitter is my Portion How much have I to say but the Infant which I bear about me stirs with my Agitation I am  Palamede  to live in Shame and this Creature be Heir to it Farewel for ever  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturd July  to  Tuesd July    WHEN we revolve in our Thoughts such Catastrophes as that in the History of the unhappy  Caelia  there seems to be something so hazardous in the changing a single State of Life into that of Marriage that it may happen all the Precautions imaginable are not sufficient to defend a Virgin from Ruin by her Choice It seems a wonderful Inconsistence in the Distribu∣tion of publick Justice that a Man who robs a Woman of an Earring or a Jewel should be pu∣nished with Death but one who by false Arts and Insinuations should take from her her very self is only to suffer Disgrace This excellent young Woman has nothing to consolate her self with but the Reflection that her Sufferings are not the Effect of any Guilt or Misconduct and has for her Protection the Influence of a Power which amidst the unjust Reproach of all Mankind can give not only Patience but Pleasure to Innocence in Distress  As the Person who is the Criminal against  Caelia  cannot be sufficiently punished according to our present Law so are there numberless unhappy Persons without Remedy according to present Custom That great Ill which has prevailed a∣mong us in these latter Ages is the making even Beauty and Virtue the Purchase of Money The Generality of Parents and some of those of Qua∣lity instead of looking out for introducing Health of Constitution Frankness of Spirit or Dignity of Countenance into their Families lay out all their Thoughts upon finding out Marches for their Estates and not their Children You shall have  one form a Plot for the Good of his Family that there shall not be Six Men in  England  capable of pretending to his Daughter A Second shall have a Son obliged out of meer Discretion for fear of doing any Thing below himself follow all the Drabs in Town These sage Parents meet and as there is no Pass no Courtship between the young Ones it is no unpleasant Observation to behold how they proceed to Treaty There is ever in the Behaviour of each something that denotes his Cir∣cumstance and honest  Coupler  the Conveniencer says he can distinguish upon Sight of the Parties before they have opened any Point of their Busi∣ness which of the Two has the Daughter to sell  Coupler  is of our Club and I have frequently heard him declaim upon this Subject and assert that the MarriageSettlements which are now used have grown fashionable even within his Memory  When the Theatre in some late Reigns owed its chief Support to those Scenes which were written to put Matrimony out of Countenance and render that State terrible then was it that PinMoney first prevailed and all the other Articles inserted which create a Diffidence and intimate to the young People that they are very soon to be in a State of War with each other Tho' this had sel∣dom happened except the Fear of it had been ex∣pressed  Coupler  will tell you also that Jointures were never frequent till the Age before his own but the Women were contented with the Third Part of the Estate the Law allotted them and scorned to engage with Men whom they thought capable of abusing their Children He has also in∣formed me that those who were the oldest Bench∣ers when he came to the  Temple  told him the first MarriageSettlement of considerable Length was the Invention of an old Serjeant who took the Opportunity of Two Testy Fathers who were ever squabbling to bring about an Alliance be∣tween their Children These Fellows knew each  other to be Knaves and the Serjeant took hold of their mutual Diffidence for the Benefit of the Law to extend the Settlement to Three Skins of Parchment  To this great Benefactor to the Profession is ow∣ing the present Price Current of Lines and Words Thus is Tenderness thrown out of the Question and the great Care is What the young Couple shall do when they come to hate each other I do not question but from this one Humour of Settle∣ments might very fairly be deduced not only our present Defection in Point of Morals but also our Want of People This has given Way to such un∣reasonable Gallantries that a Man is hardly re∣proachable that deceives an innocent Woman tho' she has never so much Merit if she is below him in Fortune The Man has no Dishonour fol∣lowing his Treachery and her own Sex are so debased by Force of Custom as to say in the Case of the Woman How could she expect he would marry her  By this Means the good Offices the Pleasures and Graces of Life are not put into the Ballance The Bridegroom has given his Estate out of him∣self and he has no more left but to follow the blind Decree of his Fate whether he shall be succeeded by a Sot or a Man of Merit in his Fortune On the other Side a fine Woman who has also a Fortune is set up by Way of Auction her first Lover has Ten to One against him The very Hour after he has opened his Heart and his RentRoll he is made no other Use of but to raise her Price She and her Friends lose no Opportunity of pub∣lishing it to call in new Bidders While the poor Lover very innocently waits till the Plenipoten∣tiaries at the Inns of Court have debated about the Alliance all the Partisans of the Lady throw Difficulties in the Way till other Offers come in and the Man who came first is not put in Posses∣sion till she has been refused by half the Town  If an Abhorrence to such mercenary Proceedings were well settled in the Minds of my Fair Read∣ers those of Merit would have a Way opened to their Advancement nay those who abound in Wealth only would in Reality find their Account in it It would not be in the Power of their Prude Acquaintance their Waiters their Nurses Cousins and Whisperers to perswade them that there are not above Twenty Men in a Kingdom and those such as perhaps they may never set Eyes on whom they can think of with Discre∣tion As the Case stands now let any one consi∣der how the great Heiresses and those to whom they were offered for no other Reason but that they could make them suitable Settlements live together What can be more insipid if not loath∣some than for Two Persons to be at the Head of a Crowd who have as little Regard for them as they for each other and behold one another in an affected Sense of Prosperity without the least Re∣lish of that exquisite Gladness at meeting that sweet Inquietude at parting together with the Charms of Voice Look Gesture and that general Benevolence between well chosen Lovers which makes all Things please and leaves not the least Trifle indifferent  But I am diverted from these Sketches for fu∣ture Essays in Behalf of my numerous Clients of the Fair Sex by a Notice sent to my Office in  SheerLane  That a blooming Widow in the Third Year of her Widowhood and Twenty six of her Age designs to take a Colonel of Twenty eight The Parties request I would draw up their Terms of coming together as having a Regard to my Opinion against long and diffident Settle∣ments and I have sens them the following In∣denture  We  John  and  Mary  having Estates for Life resolve to take each other I  John  will venture my Life to enrich thee  Mary  and I  Mary  will consult my Health to nurse thee  John  To which we have interchangeably set our Hands Hearts and Seals this th of  July    The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesday July  to  Thursday July    From my own Apartment  July  HAving devoted the greater Part of my Time to the Service of the Fair Sex I must ask Pardon of my Men Correspondents if I postpone their Commands when I have any from the La∣dies which lie unanswered That which follows is of Importance  SIR  YOU can't think it strange if I who know little of the World apply to you for Ad∣vice in the weighty Affair of Matrimony since you your self have often declared it to be of that Consequence as to require the utmost Delibera∣tion Without farther Preface therefore give me Leave to tell you that my Father at his Death left me a Fortune sufficient to make me a March for any Gentleman My Mother for she is still alive is very pressing with me to marry and I am apt to think to gratify her I shall venture upon One of Two Gentlemen who at this Time make their Addresses to me My Request is that you would direct me in my Choice which that you may the better do I shall give you their Characters and to avoid Confusion desire you to call them by the Names of  Philander  and  Sil∣vius  Philander  is young and has a good Estate  Silvius  is as young and has a better The for∣mer has had a liberal Education has seen the Town is retired from thence to his Estate in the Country is a Man of few Words and much gi∣ven to Books The latter was brought up un∣der his Father's Eye who gave him just Learn∣ing enough to enable him to keep his Accounts but made him withal very expert in Country Business such as Ploughing Sowing Buying Selling and the like They are both very so∣ber Men neither of their Persons is disagreea∣able nor did I know which to prefer till I had heard them discourse when the Conversation of  Philander  so much prevailed as to give him the Advantage with me in all other Respects My Mother pleads strongly for  Silvius  and uses these Arguments That he not only has the lar∣ger Estate at present but by his good Husban∣dry and Management increases it daily That his little Knowledge in other Affairs will make him easy and tractable whereas according to her Men of Letters know too much to make good Husbands To Part of this I ima∣gine I answer effectually by saying  Philander  's Estate is large enough That they who think  l  a Year sufficient make no Difference be∣tween that and Three I easily believe him less conversant in those Affairs the Knowledge of which she so much commends in  Silvius  but I think them neither so necessary or becoming in a Gentleman as the Accomplishments of  Philander  It is no great Character of a Man to say He rides in his Coach and Six and understands as much as he who follows his Plough Add to this That the Conversation of these Sort of Men seems so disagreeable to me that tho' they may make good Bailiffs I can hardly be perswaded they can be good Companions 'Tis possible I may seem to have odd Notions when I say I am  not fond of a Man only for being of what is called a Thriving Temper To conclude I own I am at a Loss to conceive how good Sense should make a Man an ill Husband or conversing with Books less complaisant  CAELIA  The Resolution which this Lady is going to take she may very well say is founded on Rea∣son For after the Necessities of Life are served there is no manner of Competition between a Man of Liberal Education and an Illiterate Men are not altered by their Circumstances but as they give them Opportunities of exerting what they are in themselves and a powerful Clown is a Tyrant in the most ugly Form he can possibly appear There lies a seeming Objection in the thoughtful Manner of  Philander  But let her consider which she shall oftener have Occasion to wish that  Philander  would speak or  Silvius  hold his Tongue  The Train of my Discourse is prevented by the urgent Hast of another Correspondent  July  Mr  Bickerstaff  THis comes to you from one of those Virgins of Twenty five Years old and upwards that you like a Patron of the Distressed pro∣mised to provide for who makes it her hum∣ble Request that no Occasional Stories or Sub∣jects may as they have for Three or Four of your last Days prevent your publishing the Scheme you have communicated to  Amanda  for every Day and Hour is of the greatest Con∣sequence to Damsels of so advanced an Age Be quick then if you intend to do any Service for  Your Admirer  Diana Forecast  In this important Affair I have not neglected the Proposals of others Among them is the fol∣lowing Sketch of a Lottery for Persons The Au∣thor of it has proposed very ample Encourage∣ment not only to my self but also to  Charles Lil∣lie  and  John Morphew  If the Matter bears I shall not be unjust to his Merit I only desire to enlarge his Plan for which Purpose I lay it before the Town as well for the Improvement as Encourage∣ment of it  The Amicable Contribution for raising the Fortunes of Ten young Ladies  Imprimis  It is proposed to raise Crowns by Way of Lots which will advance for each Lady  l  which Sum together with one of the Ladies the Gentleman that shall be so hap∣py as to draw a Prize provided they both like will be entitled to under such Restricti∣ons hereafter mentioned And in case they do not like then either Party that refuses shall be entitled to  l  only and the Remainder to him or her that shall be willing to marry the Man being first to declare his Mind But it is provided That if both Parties shall consent to have one another the Gentleman shall before he receives the Money thus raised settle  l  of the same in substantial Hands who shall be as Trustees for the said Ladies and shall have the whole and sole Disposal of it for her Use only  Note  Each Party shall have Three Months Time to consider after an Interview had which shall be within Ten Days after the Lots are drawn  Note also  The Name and Place of Abode of the Prize shall be placed on a proper Ticket  Item  They shall be Ladies that have had a liberal Education between Fifteen and Twenty three all genteel witty and of unblameable Characters  The Money to be raised shall be kept in an Iron Box and when there shall be Sub∣scriptions which amounts to  l  it shall be taken out and put into a Goldsmith's Hands and the Note made payable to the proper Lady or her Assigns with a Clause therein to hin∣der her from receiving it till the fortunate Person that draws her shall first sign the Note and so on till the whole Sum is subscribed for And as soon as Subscriptions are com∣pleated and Crowns more to pay the Charges the Lottery shall be drawn at a pro∣per Place to be appointed a Fortnight before the Drawing  Note  Mr  Bickerstaff  objects to the marriage∣able Years here mentioned and is of Opi∣nion they should not commence till after Twenty three But he appeals to the Learned both of  WarwickLane  and  Bishops∣gateStreet  on this Subject  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd July  to  Saturd July    White's Chocolatehouse  July  IT has been often asserted in these Papers That the great Source of our wrong Pursuits is the impertinent Manner with which we treat Women both in the common and important Circumstan∣ces of Life In vain do we say the whole Sex would run into  England  while the Privileges which are allowed them do no way ballance the  Inconveniencies arising from those very Immuni∣ties Our Women have very much indulged to them in the Participation of our Fortunes and our Liberty but the Errors they commit in the Use of either are by no means so impartially consi∣dered as the false Steps which are made by Men In the Commerce of Lovers the Man makes the Address assails and betrays and yet stands in the same Degree of Acceptance as he was in before he committed that Treachery The Woman for no other Crime but believing one whom she thought loved her is treated with Shiness and In∣difference at the best and commonly with Re∣proach and Scorn He that is past the Power of Beauty may talk of this Matter with the same Unconcern as of any other Subject Therefore I shall take upon me to consider the Sex as they live within Rules and as they transgress them The ordinary Class of the Good or the Ill have very little Influence upon the Actions of others but the Eminent in either Kind are those who lead the World below them The Ill are employed in communicating Scandal Infamy and Disease like Furies the Good distribute Benevolence Friend∣ship and Health like Angels The Ill are damped with Pain and Anguish at the Sight of all that is laudable lovely or happy The Virtuous are touched with Commiseration toward the Guilty the Disagreeable and the Wretched There are those who betray the Innocent of their own Sex and sollicit the Lewd of ours There are those who have abandoned the very Memory not only of Innocence but Shame There are those who never forgave nor could ever bear being forgi∣ven There are also who visit the Beds of the Sick lull the Cares of the Sorrowful and double the Joys of the Joyful Such is the destroying Fiend such the Guardian Angel Woman  The Way to have a greater Number of the ami∣able Part of Womankind and lessen the Crowd of the other Sort is to contribute what we can to the Success of wellgrounded Passions and there∣fore I comply with the Request of an enamoured Man in inserting the following Billet  MADAM  MR Bickerstaff  you always read tho' me you will never hear I am obliged therefore to his Compassion for the Opportunity of imploring yoursI sigh for the most Accomplished of her Sex That is so just a Distinction of her to whom I write that the owning I think so is no Distinction of me who write Your good Qualities are peculiar to you my Admiration in common with Thousands I shall be present when you read this but fear every Woman will take it for her Character sooner than she who deserves it  If the next Letter which presents it self should come from the Mistress of this modest Lover and I make them break through the Oppression of their Passions I shall expect Gloves at their Nuptials  Mr  Bickerstaff  YOU that are a Philosopher know very well the Make of the Mind of Woman and can best iustruct me in the Conduct of an Affair which high∣ly concerns me I never can admit my Lover to speak to me of Love yet think him impertinent when he offers to talk of any Thing else What shall I do with a Man that always believes me 'Tis a strange Thing this Distance in Men of Sense Why do not they always urge their Fate If we are sincere in our Severity you lose nothing by at∣tempting If we are Hypocrites you certainly suc∣ceed  From my own Apartment  July  Before I withdraw from Business for the Night it is my Custom to receive all Addresses to me that others may go to Rest as well as my self at least as far as I can contribute to it When I cal∣led to know if any would speak with me I was informed that Mr  Mills  the Player desired to be admitted He was so and with much Modesty acquainted me as he did other People of Note that  Hamlet  was to be acted on  Wednesday  next for his Benefit I had long wanted to speak with this Person because I thought I could admonish him of many Things which would tend to his Improvement In the General I observed to him That though Action was his Business the Way to that Action was not to study Gesture for the Behaviour would follow the Sentiments of the Mind  Action to the Player is what Speech is to an Orator If the Matter be well conceived Words will flow with Ease And if the Actor is well possessed of the Nature of his Part a proper Action will necessarily follow He informed me That  Wilks  was to act  Hamlet  I desired him to request of him in my Name That he would wholly for∣get Mr  Betterton  for that he failed in no Part of  Othello  but where he had him in View An Actor's forming himself by the Carriage of ano∣ther is like the Trick among the Widows who lament their Husbands as their Neighbours did theirs and not according to their own Sentiments of the Deceased  There is a Fault also in the Audience which in∣terrupts their Satisfaction very much that is the figuring to themselves the Actor in some Part wherein they formerly particularly liked him and not attending to the Part he is at that Time performing Thus whatever  Wilks  who is  the strictest Follower of Nature is acting the vulgar Spectators turn their Thoughts upon Sir  Harry Wildair  When I had indulged the Lo∣quacity of an old Man for some Time in such loose Hints I took my Leave of Mr  Mills  and was told Mr  Elliot  of St  James  's Coffeehouse would speak with me His Business was to desire I would as I am an Astrologer let him know be∣forehand who were to have the BenefitTickets in the ensuing Lottery which Knowledge he was of Opinion he could turn to great Account as he was concerned in News  I granted his Request upon an Oath of Secrecy That he would only make his own Use of it and not let it be publickly known till after they were drawn I had not done speaking when he pro∣duced to me a Plan which he had formed of keep∣ing Books with the Names of all such Adventu∣rers and the Numbers of their Tickets as should come to him in order to give an Hourly Account of what Tickets shall come up during the whole Time of the Lottery the Drawing of which is to begin on  Wednesday  next I liked his Method of disguising the Secret I had told him and pronoun∣ced him a thriving Man who could so well watch the Motion of Things and profit by a prevailing Humour and Impatience so aptly as to make his honest Industry agreeable to his Customers as it is to be the Messenger of their good Fortune  ADVERTISEMENT  From the Trumpet in SheerLane  July  Ordered That for the Improvement of the Plea∣sures of Society a Member of this House one of the most wakeful of the Soporifick Assembly beyond  SmithfieldBars  and one of the Order of StoryTel∣lers in  Holborn  may meet and exchange Stale Mat∣ter and report the same to their Principals  N B  No Man is to tell above one Story in the same Evening but has Liberty to tell

o    Est hic  Est ulubris Animus si te non deficit aequus  Hor  From  Saturd July  to  Tuesd July    From my own Apartment  July  THIS Afternoon I went to visit a Gentleman of my Acquaintance at  MileEnd  and passing through  Stepney  Churchyard I could not for∣bear entertaining my self with the Inscriptions on the Tombs and Graves Among others I ob∣served one with this notable Memorial  Here lies the Body of T B  This fantastical Desire of being remembered only by the Two first Letters of a Name led me into the Contemplation of the Vanity and imperfect Attainments of Ambition in general When I run back in my Imagination all the Men whom I have ever known and conversed with in my whole Life there are but very few who have not used their Faculties in the Pursuit of what it is impossible to acquire or left the Possession of what they might have been at their setting out Masters to search for it where it was out of their Reach In this Thought it was not possible to  forget the Instance of  Pyrrhus  who proposing to himself in Discourse with a Philosopher one and another and another Conquest was asked What he would do after all that Then says the King we will make merry He was well an∣swered What hinders your doing that in the Con∣dition you are already The restless Desire of ex∣erting themselves above the common Level of Mankind is not to be resisted in some Tempers and Minds of this Make may be observed in every Condition of Life Where such Men do not make to themselves or meet with Employment the Soil of their Constitution runs into Tares and Weeds An old Friend of mine who lost a Ma∣jor's Post Forty Years ago and quitted has ever since studied Maps Encampments Retreats and Countermarches with no other Design but to feed his Spleen and IllHumour and furnish him∣self with Matter for arguing against all the suc∣cessful Actions of others He that at his first set∣ting out in the World was the gayest Man in our Regiment ventured his Life with Alacrity and enjoyed it with Satisfaction encouraged Men below him and was courted by Men above him has been ever since the most froward Crea∣ture breathing His warm Complexion spends it self now only in a general Spirit of Contradiction for which he watches all Occasions and is in his Conversation still upon Sentry treats all Men like Enemies with every other Impertinence of a speculative Warrior  He that observes in himself this natural Inquie∣tude should take all imaginable Care to put his Mind in some Method of Gratification or he will soon find himself grow into the Condition of this disappointed Major Instead of courting proper Occasions to rise above others he will be ever studious of pulling others down to him It being the common Refuge of disappointed Ambition to ease themselves by Detraction It would  be no great Argument against Ambition that there are such mortal Things in the Disap∣pointment of it but it certainly is a forcible Ex∣ception that there can be no solid Happiness in the Success of it If we value popular Praise it is in the Power of the meanest of the People to disturb us by Calumny If the Fame of being happy we cannot look into a Village but we see Crowds in actual Possession of what we seek only the Appearance To this may be added that there is I know not what Malignity in the Minds of ordinary Men to oppose you in what they see you fond of and it is a certain Exception against a Man's receiving Applause that he visibly courts it However this is not only the Passion of great and undertaking Spirts but you see it in the Lives of such as one would believe were far enough re∣moved from the Ways of Ambition The Rural Squires of this Nation even eat and drink out of Vanity A vainglorious Foxhunter shall enter∣tain half a County for the Ostentation of his Beef and Beer without the least Affection for any of the Crowd about him He feeds them because he thinks it a Superiority over them that he does so and they devour him because they know he treats them out of Insolence This in∣deed is Ambition in Grotesque but may figure to us the Condition of politer Men whose only Pur∣suit is Glory When the Superior acts out of a Principle of Vanity the Dependant will be sure to allow it him because he knows it destructive of the very Applause which is courted by the Man who favours him and consequently makes him nearer himself  But as every Man living has more or less of this Incentive which makes Men impatient of an unactive Condition and urges Men to attempt what may tend to their Reputation it is abso∣lutely necessary they should form to themselves an Ambition which is in every Man's Power to  gratify This Ambition would be independent and would consist only in acting what to a Man's own Mind appears most great and laudable It is a Pursuit in the Power of every Man and is on∣ly a regular Prosecution of what he himself ap∣proves It is what can be interrupted by no out∣ward Accidents for no Man can be robbed of his good Intention One of our Society of the  Trum∣pet  therefore started last Night a Notion which I thought had Reason in it It is methinks said he an unreasonable Thing that Heroick Virtue should as it seems to be at present be confined to a certain Order of Men and be attainable by none but those whom Fortune has elevated to the most conspicuous Stations I would have every Thing to be esteemed as Heroick which is great and uncommon in the Circumstances in the Man who performs it Thus there would be no Virtue in humane Life which every one of the Species would not have a Pretence to arrive at and an Ardency to exert Since Fortune is not in our Power let us be as little as possible in hers Why should it be necessary that a Man should be rich to be generous If we measured by the Quality and not the Quantity of Things the Particulars which accompany an Action is what should denominate it mean or great The highest Station of humane Life is to be attained by each Man that pretends to it For every Man can be as valiant as generous as wise and as merciful as the Faculties and Opportunities which he has from Heaven and Fortune will permit He that can say to himself I do as much good and am as virtuous as my most earnest Endea∣vours will allow me whatever is his Station in the World is to himself possessed of the highest Honour If Ambition is not thus turned it is no other than a continual Succession of Anxie∣ty and Vexation But when it has this Cast it invigorates the Mind and the Consciousness of  its own Worth is a Reward which it is not in the Power of Envy Reproach or Detraction to take from it Thus the Seat of solid Honour is in a Man's own Bosom and no one can want Support who is in Possession of an honest Con∣science but he who would suffer the Reproaches of it for other Greatness  P S  I was going on in my Philosophy when Notice was brought me that there was a great Crowd in my Antichamber who expected Au∣dience When they were admitted I found they all met at my Lodgings each coming upon the same Errand to know whether they were of the Fortunate in the Lottery which is now ready to be drawn I was much at a Loss how to ex∣tricate my self from their Importunity but ob∣serving the Assembly made up of both Sexes I signified to them that in this Case it would ap∣pear Fortune is not blind for all the Lots would fall upon the Wisest and the Fairest This gave so general a Satisfaction that the Room was soon emptied and the Company retired with the best Air and the most pleasing Grace I had any where observed Mr  Elliot  of St  James  's Cof∣feehouse now stood alone before me and signi∣fied to me he had now not only prepared his Books but had received a very great Subscription already His Design was to advertise his Sub∣scribers at their respective Places of Abode with∣in an Hour after their Number is drawn whether it was a Blank or Benefit if the Adventurer lives within the Bills of Mortality if he dwells in the Country by the next Post I encouraged the Man in his Industry and told him The ready Path to good Fortune was to believe there was no such Thing  The TATLER N  o    Ut tu Fortunam sic nos te Celse feremus  Hor  From  Tuesday July  to  Thursday July    From my own Apartment  July  IT is natural for the Imaginations of Men who lead their Lives in too solitary a Manner to prey upon themselves and form from their own Conceptions Beings and Things which have no Place in Nature This often makes an Adept as much at a Loss when he comes into the World as a meer Savage To avoid therefore that Inepti∣tude for Society which is frequently the Fault of us Scholars and has to Men of Understanding and Breeding something much more shocking and untractable than Rusticity it self I take Care to visit all publick Solemnities and go into Assem∣blies as often as my Studies will permit This being therefore the first Day of the Drawing of the Lottery I did not neglect spending a conside∣rable Time in the Crowd But as much a Philo∣sopher as I pretend to be I could not but look with a Sort of Veneration upon the Two Boys which received the Tickets from the Wheels as the impartial and equal Dispensers of the For∣tunes which were to be distributed among the Crowd who all stood expecting the same Chance It seems at first Thought very wonderful that one Passion should so universally have the Pre∣eminence of another in the Possession of Men's Minds as that in this Case all in general have a secret Hope of the great Ticket And yet Fear in another Instance as in going into a Battle shall  have so little Influence as that though each Man believes there will be many Thousands slain each is consident he himself shall escape This Cer∣tainty proceeds from our Vanity for every Man sees abundance in himself that deserves Reward and nothing which should meet with Mortification But of all the Adventurers that filled the Hall there was one who stood by me who I could not but fancy expected the Thousand Pounds  per An∣num  as a meer Justice to his Parts and Industry He had his Pencil and TableBook and was at the drawing of each Lot counting how much a Man with Seven Tickets was now nearer the great Prize by the striking out another and ano∣ther Competitor This Man was of the most par∣ticular Constitution I had ever observed his Pas∣sions were so active that he worked in the ut∣most Stretch of Hope and Fear When one Ri∣val fell before him you might see a short Gleam of Triumph in his Countenance which imme∣diately vanished at the Approach of another What added to the Particularity of this Man was that he every Moment cast a Look either upon the Commissioners the Wheels or the Boys I gently whispered him and asked When he thought the Thousand Pounds would come up Pugh says he Who knows that And then looks upon a little List of his own Tickets which were pretty high in their Numbers and said it would not come this Ten Days This Fellow will have a good Chance though not that which he has put his Heart on The Man is me∣chanically turned and made for getting The Simplicity and Eagerness which he is in argues an Attention to his Point though what he is la∣bouring at does not in the least contribute to it Were it not for such honest Fellows as these the Men who govern the rest of their Species would have no Tools to work with For the outward Show of the World is carried on by such as can∣not  find out that they are doing nothing I left my Man with great Reluctance seeing the Care he took to observe the whole Conduct of the Persons concerned and compute the Inequa∣lity of the Chances with his own Hands and Eyes Dear Sir said I they must rise early that cheat you Ay said he there's nothing like a Man's minding his Business himself 'Tis very true said I The Master's Eye makes the Horse fat  As it is much the greater Number who are to go without Prizes it is but very Expedient to turn our Lecture to the forming just Sentiments on the Subject of Fortune One said this Morn∣ing That the Chief Lot he was consident would fall upon some Puppy but this Gentle∣man is one of those wrong Tempers who approve only the Unhappy and have a natural Prejudice to the Fortunate But as it is certain that there is a great Meanness in being attacked to a Man purely for his Fortune there is no less a Mean∣ness in disliking him for his Happiness It is the same Perverseness under different Colours and both these Resentments arise from meer Pride  The true Greatness of Mind consists in valuing Men apart from their Circumstances or accord∣ing to their Behaviour in them Wealth is a Di∣stinction only in Traffick but it must not be al∣lowed as a Recommendation in any other Parti∣cular but only just as it is applied It was very prettily said That we may learn the little Value of Fortune by the Persons on whom Heaven is plea∣sed to bestow it However there is not a har∣der Part in Humane Life than becoming Wealth and Greatness He must be very well stock'd with Merit who is not willing to draw some Superiority over his Friends from his Fortune For it is not every Man that can entertain with  the Air of a Guest and do good Offices with the Mien of one that receives them  I must confess I cannot conceive how a Man can place himself in a Figure wherein he can so much enjoy his own Soul and that greatest of Pleasures the just Approbation of his own Actions than as an Adventurer on this Occasion to sit and see the Lots go off without Hope or Fear perfectly unconcerned as to himself but ta∣king Part in the good Fortune of others  I will believe there are happy Tempers in be∣ing to whom all the Good that arrives to any of their FellowCreatures gives a Pleasure These live in a Course of substantial and lasting Happi∣ness and have the Satisfaction to see all Men en∣deavour to gratify them This State of Mind not only lets a Man into certain Enjoyments but relieves him from as certain Anxieties If you will not rejoice with happy Men you must re∣pine at them  Dick Reptile  alluded to this when he said He would hate no Man out of pure Idle∣ness As for my own Part I look at Fortune quite in another View than the rest of the World and by my Knowledge in Futurity tremble at the approaching Prize which I see coming to a young Lady for whom I have much Tenderness and have therefore writ her the following Let∣ter to be sent by Mr  Elliot  with the Notice of her Ticket  MADAM  YOU receive at the Instant this comes to your Hands an Account of your having what only you wanted Fortune and to ad∣monish you that you may not now want every Thing else You had yesterday Wit Virtue Beauty but you never heard of them till to Day They say Fortune is blind but you will find she has opened the Eyes of all your Behol∣ders I beseech you Madam make use of the  Advantages of having been educated without Flattery If you can still be  Chloe  Fortune has indeed been kind to you if you are al  er∣ed she has it not in her Power to give you an Equivalent  Grecian Coffeehouse  July  Some Time ago a Virtuoso my very good Friend sent me a Plan of a covered Summer∣house which a little after was rallied by ano∣ther of my Correspondents I cannot therefore defer giving him an Opportunity of making his Defence to the Learned in his own Words  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  July  SIR  I Have been this Summer upon a Ramble to visit several Friends and Relations which is the Reason I have left you and our ingenious unknown Friend of  SouthWales  so long in your Error concerning the Grassplots in my Greenhouse I will not give you the Particu∣lars of my Gardiner's Conduct in the Manage∣ment of my covered Garden but content my self with letting you know that my little Fields within Doors though by their Novelty they appear too extravagant to you to subsist even in a regular Imagination are in the Effect Things that require no Conjuration Your Correspondent may depend upon it that under a sashed Roof which lets in the Sun at all Times and the Air as often as is convenient he may have Grassplots in the greatest Per∣fection if he will be at the Pains to water mow and roll them Grass and Herbs in ge∣neral the less they are exposed to the Sun and Wind the livelier is their Verdure They re∣quire only Warmth and Moisture and if you were to see my Plots your Eye would soon con∣fess that the BowlingGreen at  Marybone  wears not half so bright a Livery  The Motto with which the Gentleman has been pleased to furnish you is so very proper and pleases me so well that I design to have it set upon the Front of my Greenhouse in Letters of Gold  I am Sir  c  The TATLER N  o    Gaudent prae Nomine molles  Auriculae  From  Thursd July  to  Saturday July    From my own Apartment  July  MAny are the Inconveniencies which happen from the improper Manner of Address in common Speech between Persons of the same or of different Quality Among these Errors there is none greater than that of the imperti∣nent Use of Title and a paraphrastical Way of saying You I had the Curiosity the other Day to follow a Crowd of People near  Billingsgate  who were conducting a passionate Woman who sold Fish to a Magistrate in order to explain some Words which were ill taken by one of her own Quality and Profession in the publick Mar∣ket When she came to make her Defence she was so very full of His Worship and of If it should please his Honour that we could for some Time hardly hear any other Apology she made for her self than that of attoning for the ill Language she had been accused of towards her Neighbour by the great Civilities she paid to her Judge But this Extravagance in her Sense of doing Honour was no more to be wondered at than that her many  Rings on each Finger were worn as Instances of Finery and Dress The Vulgar may thus heap and huddle Terms of Respect and nothing bet∣ter be expected from them but for People of Rank to repeat Appellatives insignificantly is a Folly not to be endured neither with Regard to our Times or our Understanding It is below the Dignity of Speech to extend it with more Words or Phrases than are necessary to explain our selves with Elegance And it is methinks an Instance of Ignorance if not of Servitude to be redun∣dant in such Expressions  I waited upon a Man of Quality some Morn∣ings ago He happened to be dressing and his Shoemaker fitting him told him That if his Lordship would please to tread hard or that if his Lordship would stamp a little his Lordship would find his Lordship's Shoe will fit as easie as any Piece of Work his Lordship should see in  England  As soon as my Lord was dressed a Gentleman approached him with a very good Air and told him he had an Affair which had long depended in the Lower Courts which through the Inadvertency of his Ance∣stors on the one Side and the ill Arts of their Ad∣versaries on the other could not possibly be set∣tled according to the Rules of the Lower Courts That therefore he designed to bring his Cause be∣fore the House of Lords next Session where he should be glad if his Lordship should happen to be present for he doubted not but his Cause would be approved by all Men of Justice and Ho∣nour In this Place the Word Lordship was gracefully inserted because it was applied to him in that Circumstance wherein his Quality was the Occasion of the Discourse and wherein it was most useful to the one and most honourable to the other  This Way is so far from being disrespectful to the Honour of Nobles that it is an Expedien  for using them with greater Deference I would not put Lordship to a Man's Hat Gloves Wig or Cane but to desire his Lordship's Favour his Lordship's Judgment or his Lordship's Patro∣nage is a Manner of speaking which expresses an Alliance between his Quality and his Merit It is this Knowledge which distinguished the Dis∣course of the Shoemaker from that of the Gen∣tleman The highest Point of good Breeding if any one can hit it is to show a very nice Re∣gard to your own Dignity and with that in your Heart express your Value for the Man above you  But the silly Humour to the contrary has so much prevailed that the slavish Addition of Title enervates Discourse and renders the Appli∣cation of it almost ridiculous We Writers of Diurnals are nearer in our Styles to that of com∣mon Talk than any other Writers by which Means we use Words of Respect sometimes very unfortunately The  PostMan  who is one of the most celebrated of our Fraternity fell into this Misfortune Yesterday in his Paragraph from  Ber∣lin  of  July    Count  Wartemberg says he  Great Chamberlain and Chief Minister of this Court who on  Monday  lest accompanied the King of  Prussia  to  Oranienburg  was taken so very ill th  Wednesday  has Life was despaired of and we had a Report that his Excellency was dead  I humbly presume that it slattens the Narra∣tion to say his Excellency in a Case which is common to all Men except you would infer what is not to be inferred to wit That the Author designed to say All wherein he excelled others was departed from him  Were Distinctions used according to the Rules of Reason and Sense those Additions to Men's Names would be as they were first intended sig∣nificant of their Worth and not their Persons so that in some Cases it might be proper to say  The Man is dead but his Excellency will never die It is methinks very unjust to laugh at a Quaker because he has taken up a Resolution to treat you with a Word the most expressive of Complaisance that can be thought of and with an Air of good Nature and Charity calls you Friend I say it is very unjust to rally him for this Term to a Stranger when you your selves in all your Phrases of Distinction confound Phrases of Honour into no Use at all  Tom Courtly  who is the Pink of Courtesy is an Instance of how little Moment an undistin∣guishing Application of Sounds of Honour are to those who understand themselves  Tom  never fails of paying his Obeisance to every Man he sees who has Title or Office to make him conspicuous but his Deference is wholly given to outward Considerations I who know him can tell with∣in half an Acre how much Land one Man has more than another by  Tom  's Bow to him Title is all he knows of Honour and Civility of Friend∣ship For this Reason because he cares for no Man living he is religiously strict in performing what he calls his Respects to you To this End he is very learned in Pedigree and will aba  something in the Ceremony of his Approaches to a Man if he is in any Doubt about the bearing of his Coat of Arms What is the most pleasan  of all his Character is That he acts with a So  of Integrity in these Impertinencies and thoug  he would not do any Man any solid Kindness h  is wonderfully just and careful not to wrong h  Quality But as Integrity is very scarce in th  World I cannot forbear having Respect for th  Impertinent It is some Virtue to be bound b  any Thing  Tom  and I are upon very goo  Terms for the Respect he has for the House  Bickerstaff  Tho' one cannot but laugh at his f  ¦rious Consideration of Things so little essenti  one must have a Value even for a frivolous go  Conscience  The TATLER N  o    Hesiod  From  Saturd July  to  Tuesd Aug    From my own Apartment  July  NAture has implanted in us Two very strong Desires Hunger for the Preservation of the Individual and Lust for the Support of the Spe∣cies or to speak more intelligibly the former to continue our own Persons and the latter to in∣troduce others into the World According as Men behave themselves with regard to these Ap∣petites they are above or below the Beasts of the Field which are incited by them without Choice or Reflection But reasonable Creatures correct these Incentives and improve them into elegant Motives of Friendship and Society It is chiefly from this homely Foundation that we are under the Necessity of seeking for the agreeable Companion and the honourable Mistress By this Cultivation of Art and Reason our Wants are made Pleasures and the Gratification of our Desires under proper Restrictions a Work no Way below our noblest Faculties The wisest Man may maintain his Character and yet consi∣der in what Manner he shall best entertain his Friend or divert his Mistress Nay it is so far from being a Derogation to him that he can in  o other Instances show so true a Tast of his Life or his Fortune What concerns one of the  bovementioned Appetites as it is elevated into  ove I shall have abundant Occasion to discourse  of before I have provided for the numberless Crowd of Damsels I have proposed to take Care of The Subject therefore of the present Paper shall be that Part of Society which owes its Be∣ginning to the common Necessity of Hunger When this is considered as the Support of our Be∣ing we may take in under the same Head Thirst also otherwise when we are pursuing the Glut∣ton the Drunkard may make his Escape The true Choice of our Diet and our Companions at it seems to consist in that which contributes most to Chearfulness and Refreshment And these certainly are best consulted by Simplicity in the Food and Sincerity in the Company By this Rule are in the first Place excluded from Pretence to Happiness all Meals of State and Ceremony which are performed in dumb Shew and greedy Sullenness At the Boards of the Great they say you shall have a Number attending with as good Habits and Countenances as the Guests which only Circumstance must destroy the whole Plea∣sure of the Repast For if such Attendants are introduced for the Dignity of their Appearance modest Minds are shocked by considering them as Spectators or else look upon them as Equals for whose Servitude they are in a Kind of Suffering It may be here added that the sumptuous Side∣board to an ingenious Eye has often more the Air of an Altar than a Table The next absurd Way of enjoying our selves at Meals is where the Bottle is ply'd without being called for  where Humour takes Place of Appetite and the good Company are too dull or too merry to know any Enjoyment in their Senses  Tho' this Part of Time is absolutely necessar  to sustain Life it must be also considered Tha  Life it self is to the endless Being of Man b  what a Meal is to this Life not valuable for  self but for the Purposes of it If there be an  Truth in this the Expence of many Hours th  Way is somewhat unaccountable and placing much Thought either in too great Sumptuousness and Elegance in this Matter or wallowing in Noise and Riot at it are both tho' not equally unaccountable I have often considered these dif∣ferent People with very great Attention and al∣ways speak of them with the Distinction of the Eaters and the Swallowers The Eaters sacri∣fice all their Senses and Understanding to this Ap∣petite The Swallowers hurry themselves out of both without pleasing this or any other Appetite at all The latter are improved Brutes the for∣mer degenerated Men I have sometimes thought it would not be improper to add to my Dead and Living Men Persons in an intermediate State of Humanity under the Appellation of Dozers The Dozers are a Sect who instead of keeping their Appetites in Subjection live in Subjection to them nay they are so truly Slaves to them that they keep at too great a Distance ever to come into their Presence Within my own Acquain∣tance I know those that I dare say have forgot that they ever were hungry and are no less utter Strangers to Thirst and Weariness who are be∣holden to Sauces for their Food and to their Food for their Weariness  I have often wondered confidering the excel∣lent and choice Spirits that we have among our Divines that they do not think of putting vici∣ous Habits into a more contemptible and unlove∣ly Figure than they do at present So many Men of Wit and Spirit as there are in Sacred Orders have it in their Power to make the Fashion of their Side The Leaders in humane Society are more effectu∣ally prevailed upon this Way than can easily be imagined I have more than one in my Thoughts at this Time capable of doing this against all the Opposition of the most Witty as well as the most Voluptuous There may possibly be more ac∣ceptable Subjects but sure there are none more  useful It is visible that tho' Mens Fortunes Circumstances and Pleasures give them Pre∣possessions too strong to regard any Mention ei∣ther of Punishments or Rewards they will listen to what makes them inconsiderable or mean in the Imaginations of others and by Degrees in their own  It is certain such Topicks are to be touched up∣on in the Light we mean only by Men of the most consummate Prudence as well as excellent Wit For these Discourses are to be made if made to run into Example before such as have their Thoughts more intent upon the Propriety than the Reason of the Discourse What indeed leads me into this Way of Thinking is That the last Thing I read was a Sermon of the learn∣ed Dr  South  upon  the Ways of Pleasantness  This admirable Discourse was made at Court where the Preacher was too wise a Man not to believe the greatest Argument in that Place against the Pleasures then in Vogue must be that they lost greater Pleasures by prosecuting the Course they were in The Charming Discourse has in it whatever Wit and Wisdom can put together This Gentleman has a Talent of making all his Faculties bear to the great End of his hallowed Profession Happy Genius He is the better Man for being a Wit The best Way to praise this Author is to quote him and I think I may de∣fy any Man to say a greater Thing of him or his Ability than that there are no Paragraphs in the whole Discourse I speak of below these which follow  After having recommended the Satisfaction of the Mind and the Pleasure of Conscience he proceeds  An ennobling Property of it is That it is such a Pleasure as never satiates or wearies for it properly affects the Spirit and a Spirit feels no Weariness as being privileged from the  Causes of it But can the Epicure say so of any of the Pleasures he so much dotes upon Do they not expire while they satisfy and after a few Minutes Refreshment determine in Loath∣ing and Unquietness How short is the Inter∣val between a Pleasure and a Burthen How undiscernable the Transition from one to the o∣ther Pleasure dwells no longer upon the Ap∣petie than the Necessities of Nature which are quickly and easily provided for and then all that follows is a Load and an Oppression Every Morsel to a satisfied Hunger is only a new Labour to a tired Digestion Every Draught to him that has quenched his Thirst is but a further quenching of Nature and a Provision for Rheum and Diseases a Drowning of the Quickness and Activity of the Spirits  He that prolongs his Meals and sacrifices his Time as well as his other Conveniencies to his Luxury How quickly does he outsit his Plea∣sure And then How is all the following Time bestowed upon Ceremony and Surfeit Till at length after a long Fatigue of Eating and Drinking and Babbling he concludes the great Work of dining genteely and so makes a Shift to rise from Table that he may lie down upon his Bed where after he has slept himself into some Use of himself by much ado he staggers to his Table again and there acts over the same brutish Scene So that he passes his whole Life in a dozed Condition between sleeping and waking with a Kind of Drowsiness and Con∣fusion upon his Senses which what Pleasure it can be is hard to conceive All that is of it dwells upon the Tip of his Tongue and within the Compass of his Palate A worthy Prize for a Man to purchase with the Loss of his Time his Reason and himself  The TATLER N  o    Metiri se quemque suo Module ac Pede verum est  Hor  From  Tuesday Aug  to  Thursday Aug    From my own Apartment  August  THE general Purposes of Men in the Con¦duct of their Lives I mean with relatio  to this Life only end in gaining either the Af¦fection or the Esteem of those with whom the  converse Esteem makes a Man powerful in Bu¦siness and Affection desirable in Conversation which is certainly the Reason that very agreeabl  Men fail of their Point in the World and thos  who are by no Means such arrive at it with muc  Ease If it be visible in a Man's Carriage that h  has a strong Passion to please no one is much a  a Loss how to keep Measures with him becaus  there is always a Ballance in People's Hands  make up with him by giving him what he  wants in Exchange for what you think fit to de  him Such a Person asks with Diffidence  ever leaves Room for Denial by that Softness  his Complexion At the same Time he himse  is capable of denying nothing even what he  not able to perform The other Sort of Man w  courts Esteem having a quite different View  as different a Behaviour and acts as much by  Dictates of his Reason as the other does by  Impulse of his Inclination You must pay  every Thing you have of him He consid  Mankind as a People in Commerce and ne  gives out out of himself what he is sure will  come in with Interest from another All  Words and Actions tend to the Advancement of his Reputation and of his Fortune toward which he makes hourly Progress because he lavishes no Part of his good Will upon such as do not make some Advances to merit it The Man who va∣lues Affection sometimes becomes popular he who aims at Esteem seldom falls of growing rich  Thus far we have looked at these different Men as Persons who endeavour to be valued and be∣loved from Design or Ambition but they ap∣pear in quite another Figure when you observe the Men who are agreeable and venerable from the Force of their natural Inclinations We af∣fect the Company of him who has least Regard of himself in his Carriage who throws himself into unguarded Gaiety voluntary Mirth and ge∣neral good Humour who has nothing in his Head but the present Hour and seems to have all his Interests and Passions gratified if every Man else in the Room is as unconcerned as himself This Man usually has no Quality or Character among his Companions let him be born of whom he will have what great Qualities he please let him be capable of assuming for a Moment what Figures he pleases he still dwells in the Ima∣gination of all who know him but as  Jack such a One  This makes  Jack  brighten up the Room wherever he enters and change the Severity of the Company into that Gaiety and good Humour into which his Conversation generally leads them It is not unpleasant to observe even this Sort of Creature go out of his Character to check himself sometimes for his Familiarities and pretend so aukwardly at procuring to him∣self more esteem than he finds he meets with I was the other Day walking with  Jack Gainly  to∣wards  Lincoln'sInnWalks  We met a Fellow who is a Lower Officer where  Jack  is in the Di∣rection  Jack  cries to him So How is it Mr  He answers Mr  Gainly  I am glad to see yo  well This Expression of Equality gave m  Friend a Pang which appeared in a Flush of hi  Countenance Prithee  Jack  says I do not b  angry at the Man for do what you will th  Man can only love you be contented with th  Image the Man has of thee for if thou aimes  at any other it must be Hatred or Contempt I went on and told him Look'ee  Jack  I have heard thee sometimes talk like an Oracle for half an Hour with the Sentiments of a  Roman  the Closeness of a Schoolman and the Integrity of a Divine but then  Jack  while I admired thee it was upon Topicks which did not concern thy self and where the Greatness of the Subject ad∣ded to thy being personally unconcerned in it created all that was great in thy Discourse I did not mind his being a little out of Humour but comforted him by giving him several Instances of Men of our Acquaintance who had no one Quality in any Eminence that were much more esteemed than he was with very many But the Thing is if your Character is to give Pleasure Men will consider you only in that Light and not in those Acts which turn to Esteem and Ve∣neration  When I think of  Jack Gainly  I cannot but re∣flect also upon his Sister  Gatty  She is young witty pleasant innocent This is her natural Character but when she observes any one ad∣mired for what they call a Fine Woman she i  all the next Day womanly prudent observing and virtuous She is every Moment asked in her prudential Behaviour Whether she is not well Upon which she as often answers in a Fret Do People think one must be always romping al∣ways a Jackpudding I never fail to enquire o  her If my Lady such a One that awful Beauty was not at the Play last Night She knows th  Connexion between that Question and her Chang  of Humour and says  'It would be very well if some People would examine into themselves as much as they do into others'  Or  'Sure there is nothing in the World so ridiculous as an amorous old Man'  As I was saying there is a Class which every Man is in by his Post in Nature from which it is impossible for him to withdraw to another and become it Therefore it is necessary that each should be contented with it and not endeavour at any Progress out of that Tract To follow Na∣ture is the only agreeable Course which is what I would fain inculcate to those jarring Compa∣nions  Flavia  and  Lucia  They are Mother and Daughter  Flavia  who is the Mamma has all the Charms and Desires of Youth still about her and not much turned of Thirty  Lucia  is bloom∣ing and amorous and but a little above Fifteen The Mother looks very much younger than she is the Girl very much elder If it were possible to fix the Girl to her sick Bed and preserve the Portion the Use of which the Mother partakes the good Widow  Flavia  would certainly do it But for fear of  Lucia  's Escape the Mother is for∣ced to be constantly attended with a Rival that explains her Age and draws off the Eyes of her Admirers The Jest is they can never be toge∣ther in Strangers Company but  Lucy  is eternally reprimanded for something very particular in her Behaviour for which she has the Malice to say She hopes she shall always obey her Parents She carried her Passion and Jealousy to that Height the other Day that coming suddenly into the Room and surprising Colonel  Lofty  speaking Rapture on one Knee to her Mother she clapped down by him and asked her Blessing  I do not know whether it is so proper to tell Family Occurrences of this Nature but we eve∣ry Day see the same Thing happen in the publick Conversation in the World Men cannot be con∣tented  with what is laudable but they must have all that is laudable This Affectation is what de∣stroys the familiar Man into Pretences to take State upon him and the contrary Character to the Folly of aiming at being winning and com∣plaisant But in these Cases Men may easily lay aside what they are but can never arrive at what they are not  As to the Pursuits after Affection and Esteem the Fair Sex are happy in this Particular that with them the one is much more nearly related to the other than in Men The Love of a Wo∣man is inseparable from some Esteem of her and as she is naturally the Object of Affection the Woman who has your Esteem has also some Degree of your Love A Man that dotes on a Woman for her Beauty will whisper his Friend  That Creature has a great deal of Wit when you are well acquainted with her  And if you examine the Bottom of your Esteem for a Woman you will find you have a greater Opinion of her Beau∣ty than any Body else As to us Men I design to pass most of my Time with the facetious  Harry Bickerstaff  but  William Bickerstaff  the most prudent Man of our Family shall be my Executor  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd Aug  to  Saturd Aug    From my own Apartment  August  HAving Yesterday Morning received a Paper of  Latin  Verses written with much Ele∣gance in Honour of these my Papers and being informed at the same Time that they were com∣posed by a Youth under Age I read them with  much Delight as an Instance of his Improve∣ment There is not a greater Pleasure to old Age than seeing young People entertain themselves in such a Manner as that we can partake of their Enjoyments On such Occasions we flatter our selves that we are not quite laid aside in the World but that we are either used with Grati∣tude for what we were or honoured for what we are A well inclined young Man and whose good Breeding is founded upon the Principles of Nature and Virtue must needs take Delight in being agreeable to his Elders as we are truly de∣lighted when we are not the Jest of them When I say this I must confess I cannot but think it a very lamentable Thing that there should be a Necessity for making that a Rule of Life which should be methinks a meer Instinct of Nature If Reflection upon a Man in Poverty whom we once knew in Riches is an Argument of Commi∣seration with generous Minds sure old Age which is a Decay from that Vigour which the Young possess and must certainly if not pre∣vented against their Will arrive at should be more forcibly the Object of that Reverence which honest Spirits are inclined to from a Sense of be∣ing themselves liable to what they observe has al∣ready overtaken others  My Three Nephews whom in  June  last was Twelvemonth I disposed of according to their se∣veral Capacities and Inclinations the first to the University the Second to a Merchant and the Third to a Woman of Quality as her Page by my Invitation dined with me to Day It is my Cu∣stom often when I have a Mind to give my self a more than ordinary Chearfulness to invite a certain young Gentlewoman of our Neighbour∣hood to make one of the Company She did me that Favour this Day The Presence of a beauti∣ful Woman of Honour to Minds which are not trivially disposed displays an Alacrity which is  not to be communicated by any other Object It was not unpleasant to me to look into her Thoughts of the Company she was in She smiled at the Party of Pleasure I had thought of for her which was composed of an old Man and Three Boys My Scholar my Citizen and my self were very soon neglected and the young Courtier by the Bow he made to her at her En∣trance engaged her Observation without a Rival I observed the  Oxonian  not a little discomposed at this Preference while the Trader kept his Eye upon his Unkle My Nephew  Will  had a Thou∣sand secret Resolutions to break in upon the Dis∣course of his younger Brother who gave my fair Companion a full Account of the Fashion and what was reckoned most becoming to this Com∣plexion and what Sort of Habit appeared best upon t'other Shape He proceeded to acquaint her who of Quality was well or sick within the Bills of Mortality and named very familiarly all his Lady's Acquaintance not forgetting her very Words when he spoke of their Characters Be∣sides all this he had a Road of Flattery and up∣on her enquiring what Sort of Woman Lady  Love∣ly  was in her Person Really Madam says the Jackanapes she is exactly of your Height and Shape but as you are fair she is a brown Wo∣man There was no enduring that this Fop should outshine us all at this unmerciful Rate therefore I thought fit to talk to my young Scho∣lar concerning his Studies and because I would throw his Learning into present Service I desired him to repeat to me the Translation he had made of some tender Verses in  Theocritus  He did so with an Air of Elegance peculiar to the College to which I sent him I made some Exceptions to the Turn of the Phrases which he defended with much Modesty as believing in that Place the Matter was rather to consult the Softness of a Swain's Passion than the Strength of his Expres∣sions  It soon appeared that  Will  had outstrip∣ped his Brother in the Opinion of our young La∣dy A little Poetry to one who is bred a Scholar has the same Effect that a good Carriage of his Person has on one who is to live in Courts The Favour of Women is so natural a Passion that I envied both the Boys their Success in the Appro∣bation of my Guest and I thought the only Per∣son invulnerable was my young Trader During the whole Meal I could observe in the Children a mutual Contempt and Scorn of each other ari∣sing from their different Way of Life and Educa∣tion and took that Occasion to advertise them of such growing Distasts which might mislead them in their future Life and disappoint their Friends as well as themselves of the Advantages which might be expected from the Diversity of their Professions and Interests  The Prejudices which are growing up between these Brothers from the different Ways of Edu∣cation are what create the most fatal Misunder∣standings in Life But all Distinctions of Dispa∣ragement meerly from our Circumstances are such as will not bear the Examination of Reason The Courtier the Trader and the Scholar should all have an equal Pretension to the Deno∣mination of a Gentleman That Tradesman who deals with me in a Commodity which I do not understand with Uprightness has much more Right to that Character than the Courtier who gives me false Hopes or the Scholar who laughs at my Ignorance  The Appellation of Gentleman is never to be affixed to a Man's Circumstances but to his Be∣haviour in them For this Reason I shall ever as far as I am able give my Nephews such Im∣pressions as shall make them value themselves ra∣ther as they are useful to others than as they are conscious of Merit in themselves There are no Qualities from which we ought to pretend to the  Esteem of others but such as render us service∣able to them for  Free Men have no Superiors but Benefactors  I was going on like a true old Fel∣low to this Purpose to my Guests when I recei∣ved the following Epistle  SIR  I Have yours with Notice of a BenefitTicket of  l per Annum both enclosed by  Mr  El∣liot  who had my Numbers for that Purpose Your Philosophick Advice came very seasonably to me with that good Fortune but I must be so sincere with you as to acknowledge I owe my present Moderation more to my own Folly than your wisdom You will think this strange till I inform you that I had fixed my Thoughts upon the  l  a Year and had with that Ex∣pectation laid down so many agreeable Plans for my Behaviour towards my new Lovers and old Friends that I have received this Favour of Fortune with an Air of Disappointment This is interpreted by all who know not the Springs of my Heart as a wonderful Piece of Humility I hope my present State of Mind will grow in∣to that but I confess my Conduct to be now owing to another Cause However I know you will approve my taking hold even of Im∣perfections to find my Way towards Virtue which is so feeble in us at the best that we are often beholden to our Faults for the first Ap∣pearances of it I am  SIR  Your most humble Servant  CHLOE  The TATLER N  o    Si dixeris aestuo sudat  Juv  From  Saturd August  to  Tuesd August    From my own Apartment  August  AN old Acquaintanc who met me this Morn∣ing seemed overjoyed to see me and told me I looked as well as he had known me do these Forty Years But continued he not quite the Man you were when we visited together at Lady  Brightly  's Oh  Isaac  those Days are over Do you think there are any such fine Creatures now living as we then conversed with He went on with a Thousand incoherent Circumstances which in his Imagination must needs please me but they had the quite contrary Effect The Flat∣tery with which he began in telling me how well I wore was not disagreeable but his indiscreet Mention of a Set of Acquaintance we had out∣lived recalled Ten Thousand Things to my Me∣mory which made me reflect upon my present Condition with Regret Had he indeed been so kind as after a long Absence to felicitate me up∣on an indolent and easy old Age and mentioned how much he and I had to thank for who at our Time of Day could walk firmly eat heartily and converse chearfully he had kept up my Pleasure in my self But of all Mankind there are none so shocking as these injudicious civil People They ordinarily begin upon something that they know must be a Satisfaction but then for Fear of the Imputation of Flattery they follow it with the last Thing in the World of which you would be  reminded It is this that perplexes civil Persons The Reason that there is such a general Outcry amongst us against Flatterers is that there are so very few good Ones It is the nicest Art in this Life and is a Part of Eloquence which does not want the Preparation that is necessary to all other Parts of it That your Audience should be your Wellwishers For Praise from an Enemy is the most pleasing of all Commendations  It is generally to be observed that the Person most agreeable to a Man for a Constancy is he that has no shining Qualities but is a certain Degree above great Imperfections whom he can live with as his Inferior and who will either overlook or not observe his little Defects Such an easy Com∣panion as this either now and then throws out a little Flattery or lets a Man silently flatter him∣self in his Superiority to him If you take No∣tice there is hardly a rich Man in the World who has not such a led Friend of small Considera∣tion who is a Darling for his Insignificancy It is a great Ease to have one in our own Shape a Species below us and who without being listed in our Service is by Nature of our Retinue These Dependants are of excellent Use on a Rainy Day or when a Man has not a Mind to dress or to ex∣clude Solitude when one has neither a Mind to that or to Company There are of this goodna∣tured Order who are so kind as to divide them∣selves and do these good Offices to many Five or Six of them visit a whole Quarter of the Town and exclude the Spleen without Fees from the Families they frequent If they do not prescribe Physick they can be Company when you take it Very great Benefactors to the Rich or those whom they call People at their Ease are your Persons of no Consequence I have known some of them by the Help of a little Cunning make delicious Flatterers They know the Course of the Town and the general Characters of Persons By this  Means they will sometimes tell the most agree∣able Falshoods imaginable They will acquaint you that such a One of a quite contrary Party said that tho' you were engaged in different In∣terests yet he had the greatest Respect for your good Sense and Address When one of these has a little Cunning he passes his Time in the ut∣most Satisfaction to himself and his Friends For his Position is never to report or speak a displea∣sing Thing to his Friend As for letting him go on in an Error he knows Advice against them is the Office of Persons of greater Talents and less Discretion  The  Latin  Word for a Flatterer  Assentator  implies no more than a Person that barely con∣sents and indeed such a one if a Man were able to purchase or maintain him cannot be bought too dear Such a one never contradicts you but gains upon you not by a fulsom Way of com∣mending you in broad Terms but liking what∣ever you propose or utter at the same Time is ready to beg your Pardon and gainsay you if you chance to speak Ill of your self An old Lady is very seldom without such a Companion as this who can recite the Names of all her Lovers and the Matches refused by her in the Days when she minded such Vanities as she is pleased to call them tho' she so much approves the Mention of them It is to be noted that a Woman's Flatterer is generally older than her self her Years serving at once to recommend her Patroness's Age and to add Weight to her Complaisance in all other Particulars  We Gentlemen of small Fortunes are extreme∣ly necessitous in this Particular I have indeed one who smokes with me often but his Parts are so low that all the Incense he does me is to fill his Pipe with me and to be out at just as many Whiffs as I take This is all the Praise or Assent that he is capable of yet there are more Hours when I  would rather be in his Company than that of the brightest Man I know It would be an hard Mat∣ter to give an Account of this Inclination to be flattered but if we go to the Bottom of it we shall find that the Pleasure in it is something like that of receiving Money which lay out Every Man thinks he has an Estate of Reputation and is glad to see one that will bring any of it Home to him It is no Matter how dirty a Bag it is con∣veyed to him in or by how clownish a Messenger so the Money is good All that we want to be pleased with Flattery is to believe that the Man is sincere who gives it us It is by this one Ac∣cident that absurd Creatures often outrun the more Skilful in this Art Their Want of Ability is here an Advantage and their Bluntness as it is the seeming Effect of Sincerity is the best Co∣ver to Artifice  Terence  introduces a Flatterer talking to a Cox∣comb whom he cheats out of a Livelihood and a third Person on the Stage makes on him this plea∣sant Remark  "This Fellow has an Art of making Fools Madmen"  The Love of Flattery is in∣deed sometimes the Weakness of a great Mind but you see it also in Persons who otherwise dis∣cover no Manner of Relish of any Thing above meer Sensuality These latter it sometimes im∣proves but always debases the former A Fool is in himself the Object of Pity till he is flattered By the Force of that his Stupidity is raised into Affectation and he becomes of Dignity enough to be ridiculous I remember a Drole that upon one's saying The Times are so ticklish that there must great Care be taken what one says in Con∣versation answered with an Air of Surliness and Honesty If People will be free let them be so in the Manner that I am who never abuse a Man but to his Face He had no Reputation for say∣ing dangerous Truths therefore when it was re∣peated You abuse a Man but to his Face Yes says he I flatter him  It is indeed the greatest of Injuries to flatter any but the Unhappy or such as are displeased with themselves for some Infirmity In this latter Case we have a Member of our Club that when Sir  Jeffery  falls asleep wakens him with Snoring This makes Sir  Jeffery  hold up for some Moments the longer to see there are Men younger than himself among us who are more Lethargick than he is  When Flattery is practised upon any other Con∣sideration it is the most abject Thing in Nature nay I cannot think of any Character below the Flatterer except he that envies him You meet with Fellows prepared to be as mean as possible in their Condescentions and Expressions but they want Persons and Talents to rise up to such a Base∣ness As a Coxcomb is a Fool of Parts so is a Flatterer a Knave of Parts  The best of this Order that I know is one who disguises it under a Spirit of Contradiction or Re∣proof He told an errant Driveler the other Day That he did not care for being in Company with him because he heard he turned his absent Friends into Ridicule And upon Lady  Autumn  's dispu∣ting with him about something that happened at the Revolution he replied with a very angry Tone Pray Madam give me Leave to know more of a Thing in which I was actually con∣cerned than you who were then in your Nurse's Arms  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesd August  to  Thursd August    From my own Apartment  August  ANoble Painter who has an Ambition to draw an HistoryPiece has desired of me to give him a Subject on which he may show the utmost Force of his Art and Genius For this Purpose I have pitched upon that remarkable Incident be∣tween  Alexander the Great  and his Physician This Prince in the Midst of his Conquests in  Persia  was seized by a violent Fever and according to the Account we have of his  vast  Mind his Thoughts were more employed about his Recovery as it regarded the War than as it concerned his own Life He professed a slow Method was worse than Death to him because it was what he more dreaded an Interruption of his Glory He desi∣red a dangerous so it might be a speedy Reme∣dy During this Impatience of the King it is well known that  Darius  had offered an immense Sum to any who should take away his Life But  Philippus  the most esteemed and most knowing of his Physicians promised that within Three Days Time he would prepare a Medicine for him which should restore him more expeditiously than could be imagined Immediately after this En∣gagement  Alexander  receives a Letter from the most considerable of his Captains with Intelli∣gence That  Darius  had bribed  Philippus  to poi∣son him Every Circumstance imaginable favou∣red this Suspicion but this Monarch who did nothing but in an extraordinary Manner conceal∣ed the Letter and while the Medicine was pre∣paring spent all his Thoughts upon his Behaviour  in this important Incident From his long Soli∣loquy he came to this Resolution  "  Alexander  must not lie here alive to be oppressed by his Enemy I will not believe my Physician guilty or I will perish rather by his Guilt than my own Diffidence'  At the appointed Hour  Philippus  enters with the Potion One cannot but form to one's self on Occasion the Encounter of their Eyes the Resolu∣tion in those of the Patient and the Benevolence in the Countenance of the Physician The Hero raised himself in his Bed and holding the Letter in one Hand and the Potion in the other drank the Medicine It will exercise my Friend's Pencil and Brain to place this Action in its proper Beauty A Prince observing the Features of a suspected Traytor after having drank the Poison he offer'd him is a Circumstance so full of Passion that it will require the highest Strength of his Imagina∣tion to conceive it much more to express it But as Painting is Eloquence and Poetry in Mecha∣nism I shall raise his Idea's by reading with him the finest Draughts of the Passions concerned in this Circumstance from the most excellent Poets and Orators The Confidence which  Alexander  assumes from the Air of  Philippus  's Face as he is reading his Accusation and the generous Disdain which is to rise in the Features of a falsly accused Man are principally to be regarded In this Par∣ticular he must heighten his Thoughts by reflect∣ing that he is not drawing only an innocent Man traduced but a Man zealously affected to his Per∣son and Safety full of Resentment for being thought false How shall we contrive to express the highest Admiration mingled with Disdain How shall we in Strokes of a Pencil say what  Philippus  did to his Prince on this Occasion  "Sir my Life never depended on yours more than it does now Without knowing this Secret I prepared the Potion which you have taken as  what concerned  Philippus  no less than  Alexander  and there is nothing new in this Adventure but that it makes me still more admire the Generosity and Confidence of my Master"  Alexander  took him by the Hand and said  "  Philippus  I am con∣fident you had rather I had any other Way to have manifested the Faith I have in you than a Case which so nearly concerns me And in Gra∣titude I now assure you I am anxious for the Effect of your Medicine more for your Sake than my own'  My Painter is employed by a Man of Sense and Wealth to furnish him a Gallery and I shall join with my Friend in the Designing Part It is the great Use of Pictures to raise in our Minds either agreeable Idea's of our absent Friends or high Images of eminent Personages But the latter De∣sign is methinks carried on in a very improper Way For to fill a Room full of BattlePieces pompous Histories of Sieges and a tall Hero a∣lone in a Crowd of insignificant Figures about him is of no Consequence to private Men But to place before our Eyes great and illustrious Men in those Parts and Circumstances of Life wherein their Behaviour may have an Effect upon our Minds as being such as we partake with them merely as they were Men Such as these I say may be just and useful Ornaments of an elegant Apartment In this Collection therefore that we are making we will not have the Battles but the Sentiments of  Alexander  The Affair we were just now talking of has Circumstances of the highest Nature and yet their Grandeur has little to do with his Fortune If by observing such a Piece as that of his taking a Bowl of Poison with so much Magnanimity a Man the next Time he has a Fit of the Spleen is less froward to his Friend or his Servants thus far is some Improvement  I have frequently thought that if we had many Draughts which were Historical of certain Passions and had the true Figure of the great Men we see transported by them it would be of the most solid Advantage imaginable To consider this mighty Man on one Occasion administer to the Wants of a poor Soldier benummed with Cold with the greatest Humanity at another barbarously stab∣bing a faithful Officer At one Time so gene∣rously chast and virtuous as to give his Captive  Statira  her Liberty at another burning a Town at the Instigation of  Thais  This Sort of Changes in the same Person are what would be more bene∣ficial Lessons of Morality than the several Revo∣lutions in a great Man's Fortune There are but One or Two in an Age to whom the pompous In∣cidents of his Life can be exemplary but I or any Man may be as sick as goodnatur'd as compassio∣nate and as angry as  Alexander the great  My Purpose in all this Chat is that so excellent a Fur∣niture may not for the future have so Romantick a Turn but allude to Incidents which come with∣in the Fortunes of the ordinary Race of Men I do not know but 'tis by the Force of this senseless Custom that People are drawn in Postures they would not for half they are worth be surprised in The unparallell'd Firceness of some Rural 'Squires drawn in Red or in Armour who never dreamed to destroy any Thing above a Fox is a common and ordinary Offence of this Kind But I shall give an Account of our whole Gallery on another Occasion  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd Aug  to  Saturd Aug    SheerLane  August  I Did my self the Honour this Day to make a Visit to a Lady of Quality who is one of those who are ever railing at the Vices of the Age but mean only one Vice because it is the only Vice they are not guilty of She went so far as to fall foul on a young Woman who has had Imputa∣tions but whether they were just or not no one knows but her self However that is she is in her present Behaviour modest humble pious and discreet I thought it became me to bring this cen∣sorious Lady to Reason and let her see she was a much more vitious Woman than the Person she spoke of  Madam said I you are very severe to this poor young Woman for a Trespass which I believe Heaven has forgiven her and for which you see she is for ever out of Countenance Nay Mr  Bick∣erstaff  she interrupted If you at this Time of Day contradict People of Virtue and stand up for ill WomenNo no Madam said I not so fast she is reclaimed and I fear you never will be Nay nay Madam do not be in a Passion but let me tell you what you are You are indeed as good as your Neighbours but that is being very bad You are a Woman at the Head of a Family and lead a perfect Town Lady's Life You go on your own Way and consult nothing but your Glass What Imperfections indeed you see there you immediately mend as fast as you can You may do the same by the Faults I tell you of for they are much more in your Power to correct  You are to know then that you Visiting Ladies that carry your Virtue from House to House with so much Prattle in each other's Applause and tri∣umph over other People's Faults I grant you have but the Speculation of Vice in your own Conver∣sations but promote the Practice of it in all others you have to do with  As for you Madam your Time passes away in Dressing Eating Sleeping and Praying When you rise in Morning I grant you an Hour spent very well but you come out to dress in so fro∣ward a Humour that the poor Girl who attends you curses her very Being in that she is your Ser∣vant for the peevish Things you say to her When this poor Creature is put into a Way that Good or Evil are regarded but as they relieve her from the Hours she has and must pass with you The next you have to do with is your Coachman and Footmen They convey your Ladyship to Church While you are praying there they are cursing swearing and drinking in an Alehouse During the Time also which your Ladyship sets apart for Heaven you are to know that your Cook is sweating and fretting in Preparation for your Dinner Soon after your Meal you make Visits and the whole World that belongs to you speaks all the Ill of you which you are repeating of o∣thers You see Madam whatever Way you go all about you are in a very broad one The Mora∣lity of these People it is your proper Business to enquire into and till you reform them you had best let your Equals alone otherwise if I allow you you are not vitious you must allow me you are not virtuous  I took my Leave and received at my coming Home the following Letter  Mr  Bickerstaff  I Have lived a pure and undefiled Virgin these Twenty seven Years and I assure you 'tis with great Grief and Sorrow of Heart I tell you that I become weary and impatient of the Deri∣sion of the Gigglers of our Sex who call me old Maid and tell me I shall lead Apes If you are truly a Patron of the Distressed and an Adept in Astrology you will advise whether I shall or ought to be prevailed upon by the Impertinen∣cies of my own Sex to give Way to the Impor∣tunities of yours I assure you I am surrounded with both tho' at present a Forlorn  I am  c  I must defer my Answer to this Lady out of a Point of Chronology She says she has been Twenty Seven Years a Maid but I fear according to a common Error she dates her Virginity from her Birth which is a very erroneous Method for a Woman of Twenty is no more to be thought chast so many Years than a Man of that Age can be said to have been so long Valiant We must not allow People the Favour of a Virtue till they have been under the Temptation to the contrary A Woman is not a Maid till her BirthDay as we call it of her Fifteenth Year My Plaintiff is there∣fore desired to inform me whether she is at pre∣sent in her Twenty eighth or Forty third Year and she shall be dispatched accordingly  St James's Coffeehouse  August  A Merchant came hither this Morning and read a Letter from a Correspondent of his at  Milan  It was dated of the th Instant N S The following is an Abstract of it On the th of the last Month Five Thousand Men were on their March in the  Lampourdan  under the Command of General  We¦sell  having received Orders from his Catholick Majesty to join him in his Camp with all possible  Expedition The Duke of  Anjou  soon had Intelli∣gence of their Motion and took a Resolution to decamp in order to intercept them within a Day's March of our Army The King of  Spain  was ap∣prehensive the Enemy might make such a Move∣ment and commanded General  Stanhope  with a Body of Horse consisting of Fourteen Squadrons to observe their Course and prevent their Passage over the Rivers  Segra  and  Noguera  between  Larida  and  Balaguer  It happened to be the first Day that Officer had appeared Abroad after a dangerous and violent Fever but he received the King's Com∣mands on this Occasion with a Joy which sur∣mounted his present Weakness and on the th of last Month came up with the Enemy on the Plains of  Balaguer  The Duke of  Anjou  's RearGuard consisting of Twenty six Squadrons that General sent Intelligence of their Posture to the King and desired his Majesty's Orders to attack them During the Time which he waited for his Instructions he made his Disposition for the Charge which was to divide themselves into Three Bodies One to be commanded by himself in the Center a Body on the Right by Count  Mau∣rice  of  Nassau  and the Third on the Left by the Earl of  Rochford  Upon the Receipt of his Ma∣jesty's Direction to attack the Enemy the General himself charged with the utmost Vigour and Re∣solution while the Earl of  Rochford  and Count  Maurice  extended themselves on his Right and Left to prevent the Advantage the Enemy might make of the Superiority of their Numbers What appears to have misled the Enemy's General in this Affair was that it was not supposed practicable that the Confederates would attack him till they had received a Reinforcement For this Reason he pursued his March without facing about till we were actually coming on to Engagement Gene∣ral  Stanhope  's Disposition made it impracticable to do it at that Time Count  Maurice  and the Earl  of  Rochford  attacking them in the Instant in which they were forming themselves The Charge was made with the greatest Gallantry and the Enemy very soon put into so great Disorder that their whole Cavalry were commanded to support their RearGuard Upon the Advance of this Rein∣forcement all the Horse of the King of  Spain  were come up to sustain General  Stanhope  inso∣much that the Battle improved to a general En∣gagement of the Cavalry of both Armies After a warm Dispute for some Time it ended in the utter Defeat of all the Duke of  Anjou  's Horse Upon the Dispatch of these Advices that Prince was retiring towards  Lerida  We have no Ac∣count of any considerable Loss on our Side except that both those Heroick Youths the Earl of  Roch∣ford  and Count  Nassau  fell in this Action They were you know both Sons of Persons who had a great Place in the Confidence of your late King  William  and I doubt not but their Deaths will endear their Families which were ennobled by him in your Nation General  Stanhope  has been reported by the Enemy dead of his Wounds but he received only a slight Contusion on the Shoul∣der  P S  We acknowledge you here a mighty brave People but you are said to love quarrelling so well that you cannot be quiet at Home The Favourers of the House of  Bourbon  among us affirm That this  Stanhope  who could as it were get out of his sick Bed to fight against their King of  Spain  must be of the Antimonarchical Party  The TATLER N  o    Nequeo monstrare sentio tantum  Juv  From  Saturd Aug  to  Tuesd Aug    Sunday August  IF there were no other Consequence of it but barely that Humane Creatures on this Day as∣semble themselves before their Creator with∣out Regard to their usual Employments their Minds at Leisure from the Cares of this Life and their Bodies adorned with the best Attire they can bestow on them I say were this meer outward Celebration of a Sabbath all that is ex∣pected from Men even that were a laudable Di∣stinction and a Purpose worthy the Humane Na∣ture But when there is added to it the sublime Pleasure of Devotion our Being is exalted above it self and he who spends a Seventh Day in the Contemplation of the next Life will not easily fall into the Corruptions of this in the other Six They who never admit Thoughts of this Kind into their Imagination lose higher and sweeter Satisfactions than can be raised by any other En∣tertainment The most illiterate Man who is touched with Devotion and uses frequent Exer∣cises of it contracts a certain Greatness of Mind mingled with a noble Simplicity that raises him above those of the same Condition and there is an indelible Mark of Goodness in those who sin∣cerely possess it It is hardly possible it should be otherwise for the Fervours of a pious Mind will naturally contract such an Earnestness and Attention towards a better Being as will make  the ordinary Passages of Life go off with a be∣coming Indifference By this a Man in the lowest Condition will not appear mean or in the most splendid Fortune insolent  As to all the Intricacies and Vicissitudes under which Men are ordinarily intangled with the ut∣most Sorrow and Passion one who is devoted to Heaven when he falls into such Difficulties is led by a Clue through a Labyrinth As to this World he does not pretend to Skill in the Mazes of it but fixes his Thoughts upon one Certainty that he shall soon be out of it And we may ask very boldly What can be a more sure Consola∣tion than to have an Hope in Death When Men are arrived at thinking of their very Dissolution with Pleasure how few Things are there that can be terrible to them Certainly nothing can be dreadful to such Spirits but what would make Death terrible to them Falshood towards Man or Impiety towards Heaven To such as these as there are certainly many such the Gratifications of innocent Pleasures are doubled even with Re∣flections upon their Imperfection The Disap∣pointments which naturally attend the great Pro∣mises we make our selves in expected Enjoy∣ments strike no Damp upon such Men but only quicken their Hopes of soon knowing Joys which are too pure to admit of Allay or Sa∣tiety  It is thought among the politer Part of Man∣kind an Imperfection to want a Relish of any of those Things which refine our Lives This is the Foundation of the Acceptance which Eloquence Musick and Poetry make in the World and I know not why Devotion considered meerly as an Exaltation of our Happiness should not at leas  be so far regarded as to be considered It is pos¦sible the very Enquiry would lead Men into suc  Thoughts and Gratifications as they did not ex¦pect to meet with in this Place Many a goo  Acquaintance has been lost from a general Pre∣possession in his Disfavour and a severe Aspect has often hid under it a very agreeable Compa∣nion  There are no distinguishing Qualities among Men to which there are not false Pretenders but tho' none is more pretended to than that of De∣votion there are perhaps fewer successful Im∣postors in this Kind than any other There is something so natively great and good in a Person that is truly devout that an aukward Man may as well pretend to be genteel as an Hypocrite to be pious The Constraint in Words and Actions are equally visible in both Cases and any Thing set up in their Room does but remove the En∣deavourers the further off their Pretensions But however the Sense of true Piety is abated there is no other Motive of Action that can carry us through all the Vicissitudes of Life with Alacrity and Resolution But Piety like Philosophy when it is superficial does but make Men ap∣pear the worse for it and a Principle that is but half received does but distract instead of gui∣ding our Behaviour When I reflect upon the unequal Conduct of  Lotius  I see many Things that run directly counter to his Interest there∣fore I cannot attribute his Labours for the publick Good to Ambition When I consider his Disre∣gard to his Fortune I cannot esteem him cove∣tous How then can I reconcile his Neglect of himself and his Zeal for others I have long suspected him to be  a little Pious  But no Man ever hid his Vice with greater Caution than he does his Virtue It was the Praise of a great  Ro∣man  That he had rather be than appear good But such is the Weakness of  Lotius  that I dare say he had rather be esteemed irreligious than devout By I know not what Impatience of Rail∣  ery he is wonderfully fearful of being thought  oo great a Believer A Hundred little Devices  are made use of to hide a Time of private Devo∣tion and he will allow you any Suspicion of his being ill employed so you do not tax him with being well But alas How mean is such a Be∣haviour To boast of Virtue is a most ridiculous Way of disappointing the Merit of it but not so pitiful as that of being ashamed of it How un∣happy is the Wretch who makes the most abso∣lute and independent Motive of Action the Cause of Perplexity and Inconstancy How much ano∣ther Figure does  Caelicola  make with all who know him His great and superior Mind fre∣quently exalted by the Raptures of Heavenly Me∣ditation is to all his Friends of the same Use as if an Angel were to appear at the Decision of their Disputes They very well understand he is as much disinterested and unbiass'd as such a Be∣ing He considers all Applications made to him as those Addresses will effect his own Applica∣tion to Heaven All his Determinations are de∣liver'd with a beautiful Humility and he pro∣nounces his Decisions with the Air of one who is more frequently a Supplicant than a Judge  Thus humble and thus great is the Man who is moved by Piety and exalted by Devotion But behold this recommended by the masterly Hand of a great Divine I have heretofore made bold with  It is such a Pleasure as can never cloy or overwork the Mind a Delight that grows and improves under Thought and Reflection and while it exercises does also endear it self to the Mind All Pleasure that affect the Body must needs weary because they transport and all Transportation is a Violence and no Violence can be lasting but determines upon the Falling of the Spirits which are not able to keep up that Height of Motion that the Plea¦sure of the Senses raises them to And there¦fore how inevitably does an immoderate Laugh¦ter  end in a Sigh which is only Nature's reco∣vering it self after a Force done to it But the religious Pleasure of a welldisposed Mind moves gently and therefore constantly It does not effect by Rapture and Extasie but is like the Pleasure of Health greater and stronger than those that call up the Senses with grosser and more affecting Impressions No Man's Body is as strong as his Appetites but Heaven has cor∣rected the Boundlesness of his voluptuous De∣sires by stinting his Strengths and contracting his CapacitiesThe Pleasure of the reli∣gious Man is an easy and a portable Pleasure such an one as he carries about in his Bosom without alarming either the Eye or Envy of the World A Man putting all his Pleasure into this one is like a Traveller putting all his Goods into one Jewel the Value is the same and the Convenience greater  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesday Aug  to  Thursday Aug    From my own Apartment  Aug  I Have had much Importunity to answer the following Letter  Mr  Bickerstaff  REading over a Volume of Yours I find the Words  Simplex Munditiis  mentioned as a De∣scription of a very well dressed Woman I beg of you for the Sake of the Sex to explain these Terms I cannot comprehend what my Brother means  when he tells me they signify my own Name which is  SIR  Your humble Servant  Plain English  I think the Lady's Brother has given us a very good Idea of that elegant Expression it being the greatest Beauty of Speech to be close and intelli∣gible To this End nothing is to be more care∣fully consulted than Plainness In a Lady's At∣tire this is the single Excellence for to be what some call fine is the same Vice in that Case as to be florid is in Writing or Speaking I have studied and writ on this important Subject till I almost despair of making a Reformation in the Females of this Island where we have more Beauty than in any Spot in the Universe if we did not disguise it by false Garniture and detract from it by impertinent Improvements I have by me a Treatise concerning Pinners which I have some Hopes will contribute to the Amend∣ment of the present Headdresses to which I have solid and unanswerable Objections But most of the Errors in that and other Particulars of adorning the Head are crept into the World from the Ignorance of modern Tirewomen for it is come to that Pass that an aukward Crea∣ture in the first Year of her Apprenticeship that can hardly stick a Pin shall take upon her to dress a Woman of the First Quality However it is certain that there requires in a good Tire∣woman a perfect Skill in Opticks for all the Force of Ornament is to contribute to the Inten∣tion of the Eyes Thus she who has a Mind to look killing must arm her Face accordingly and not leave her Eyes and Cheeks undressed Ther  is  Araminta  so sensible of this that she neve  will see even her own Husband without a Hood on Can any one living bear to see Miss  Gruel  lean as she is with her Hair tied back after the modern Way But such is the Folly of our La∣dies that because one who is a Beauty out of Ostentation of her being such takes Care to wear something that she knows cannot be of any Consequence to her Complexion I say our Wo∣men run on so heedlesly in the Fashion that tho' it is the Interest of some to hide as much of their Faces as possible yet because a leading Toast ap∣peared with a backward Headdress the rest shall follow the Mode without observing that the Author of the Fashion assumed it because it could become no one but her self  Flavia  is ever well dressed and always the gentilest Woman you meet But the Make of her Mind very much contributes to the Ornament of her Body She has the greatest Simplicity of Manners of any of her Sex This makes every Thing look native about her and her Cloaths are so exactly fitted that they appear as it were Part of her Person Every one that sees her knows her to be of Quality but her Distinction is owing to her Manner and not to her Habit Her Beauty is full of Attraction but not of Al∣lurement There is such a Composure in her Looks and Propriety in her Dress that you would think it impossible she should change the Garb you one Day see her in for any Thing so becoming till you next Day see her in another There is no other Mystery in this but that how∣ever she is apparelled she is her self the same For there is so immediate a Relation between our Thoughts and Gestures that a Woman must think well to look well  But this weighty Subject I must put off for some other Matters in which my Correspondents are urgent for Answers which I shall do where I  can and appeal to the Judgment of others where I cannot  August  Mr  Bickerstaff  TAking the Air t'other Day on Horseback in the Green Lane that leads to  Southgate  I disco∣vered coming towards me a Person well mounted in a Mask and I accordingly expected as any one would to have been robbed But when we came up with each other the Spark to my greater Surprize very peaceably gave me the Way which made me take Courage enough to ask him if he masqueraded or how He made me no Answer but still continued  incognito  This was certainly an Ass in a Lion's Skin a harmless BullBeggar who delights

But before we discourse of this Vice it will be ne∣cessary to observe that the Learned make a Dif∣ference between Simulation and Dissimulation Si∣mulation is a Pretence of what is not and Dis∣simulation a Concealment of what is The lat∣ter  is our present Affair When you look round you in publick Places in this Island you see the Generality of Mankind carry in their Counte∣nance an Air of Challenge or Defiance And there is no such Man to be found among us who naturally strives to do greater Honours and Civi∣lities than he receives This innate Sullenness or Stubborness of Complexion is hardly to be con∣quered by any of our Islanders For which Rea∣son however they may pretend to choose one another they make but very aukward Rogues and their Dislike to each other is seldom so well dissembled but it is suspected When once it is so it had as good be professed A Man who dis∣sembles well must have none of what we call Stomach otherwise he will be cold in his Pro∣fessions of GoodWill where he hates an Imper∣fection of the last ill Consequence in Business This Fierceness in our Natures is apparent from the Conduct of our young Fellows who are not got into the Schemes and Arts of Life which the Children of this World walk by One would think that of Course when a Man of any Con∣sequence for his Figure his Mien or his Gravity passes by a Youth he should certainly have the first Advances of Salutation but he is you may observe treated in a quite different Manner it being the very Characteristick of an  English  Temper to defy As I am an  Englishman  I find it a very hard Matter to bring my self to pull off the Hat first but it is the only Way to be upon any good Terms with those we meet with There∣fore the first Advance is of high Moment Men judge of others by themselves and he that will command with us must condescend It moves ones Spleen very agreeably to see Fellows pre∣tend to be Dissemblers without this Lesson They are so reservedly complaisant till they have learn¦ed to resign their natural Passions that all the Steps they make towards gaining those whom  they would be well with are but so many Marks of what they really are and not of what they would appear  The rough  Britains  when they pretend to be artful towards one another are ridiculous enough but when they set up for Vices they have not and dissemble their Good with an Affectation of Ill they are insupportable I know Two Men in this Town who make as good Figures as any in it that manage their Credit so well as to be thought Atheists and yet say their Prayers Mor∣ning and Evening

August  Mr  Bickerstaff  I Have lately read your Paper wherein you represent a Conversation between a young Lady your Three Nephews and your self and am not a little offended at the Figure you give your young Merchant in the Presence of a Beau∣ty The Topick of Love is a Subject on which a Man is more beholden to Nature for his Elo∣quence than to the Instruction of the Schools or my Lady's Woman From the Two latter your Scholar and Page must have reaped all their Advantage above himI know by this Time you have pronounced me a Trader I ac∣knowledge it but cannot bear the Exclusion from any Pretence of speaking agreeably to a Fine Woman or from any Degree of Genero∣sity that Way You have among us Citizens  many Wellwishers but it is for the Justice of your Representations which we perhaps are better Judges of than you by the Account you give of your Nephew seem to allow  To give you an Opportunity of making us some Reparation I desire you would tell your own Way the following Instance of Heroick Love in the City You are to remember that somewhere in your Writings for enlarging the Territories of Virtue and Honour you have multiplied the Opportunities of attaining to He∣roick Virtue and have hinted that in whatever State of Life a Man is if he does Things above what is ordinarily performed by Men of his Rank he is in those Instances an Hero  Tom Trueman  a young Gentleman of Eighteen Years of Age fell passionately in Love with the beauteous  Almira  Daughter to his Master Her Regard for him was no less tender  True∣man  was better acquainted with his Master's Affairs than his Daughter and secretly lament∣ed that each Day brought him by many Mis∣carriages nearer Bankrupcy than the former This unhappy Posture of their Affairs the Youth suspected was owing to the ill Manage∣ment of a Factor in whom his Master had an entire Confidence  Trueman  took a proper Oc∣casion when his Master was ruminating on his decaying Fortune to address him for Leave to spend the Remainder of his Time with his Fo∣reign Correspondent During Three Years Stay in that Employment he became acquaint∣ed with all that concerned his Master and by his great Address in the Management of that Knowledge saved him Ten thousand Pounds Soon after this Accident  Trueman  's Unkle left him a considerable Estate Upon receiving that Advice he returned to  England  and deman∣ded  Almira  of her Father The Father over joy'd at the Match offer'd him the  l  he  had saved him with the further Proposal of resigning to him all his Business  Trueman  re∣fused both and retired into the Country with his Bride contented with his own Fortune tho' perfectly skill'd in all the Methods of improving it  It is to be noted That  Trueman  refused Twen∣ty Thousand Pounds with another young Lady so that reckoning both his SelfDenials he is to have in your Court the Merit of having gi∣ven  l  for the Woman he loved This Gentleman I claim your Justice to and hope you will be convinced that some of

TATLER N  o    Soles aperta Serena  Prospicere certis poteris cognoscere Signis  Virg  From  Saturd Aug  to  Tuesd Aug    From my own Apartment  August  IN every Party there are Two Sorts of Men the  Rigid  and the  Supple  The  Rigid  are an intractable Race of Mortals who act upon Prin∣ciple and will not forsooth fall into any Mea∣sures that are not consistent with their received  Notions of Honour These are Persons of a stub∣born unpliant Morality that sullenly adhere to their Friends when they are disgraced and to their Principles tho' they are exploded I shall therefore give up this stiffnecked Generation to their own Obstinacy and turn my Thoughts to the Advantage of the  Supple  who pay their Ho∣mage to Places and not Persons and without enslaving themselves to any particular Scheme of Opinions are as ready to change their Conduct in Point of Sentiment as of Fashion The well∣disciplined Part of a Court are generally so per∣fect at their Exercise that you may see a whole Assembly from Front to Rear face about at once to a new Man of Power tho' at the same Time they turn their Backs upon him that brought them thither The great Hardship these com∣plaisant Members of Society are under seems to be the Want of Warning upon any approaching Change or Revolution so that they are obliged in a Hurry to tack about with every Wind and stop short in the Midst of a full Career to the great Surprize and Derision of their Beholders  When a Man foresees a decaying Ministry he has Leisure to grow a Malecontent reflect upon the present Conduct and by gradual Murmurs fall off from his Friends into a new Party by just Steps and Measures For Want of such No∣tices I have formerly known a very wellbred Person refuse to return a Bow of a Man whom he thought in Disgrace that was next Day made Se∣cretary of State and another who after a long Neglect of a Minister came to his Levee and made Professions of Zeal for his Service the very Day before he was turned out  This produces also unavoidable Confusions and Mistakes in the Descriptions of great Mens Parts and Merits That ancient Lyrick Mr  D'Urfey  some Years ago writ a Dedication to a certain Lord in which he celebrated him for the greatest  Poet and Critick of that Age upon a Misinfor∣mation in  Dyer  's Letter that his noble Patron was made Lord Chamberlain In short innume∣rable Votes Speeches and Sermons have been thrown away and turned to no Account meerly for Want of due and timely Intelligence Nay it has been known that a Panegyrick has been half printed off when the Poet upon the Removal of the Minister has been forced to alter it into a Satyr  For the Conduct therefore of such useful Per∣sons as are ready to do their Country Service up∣on all Occasions I have an Engine in my Study which is a Sort of a Political Barometer or to speak more intelligibly a State  WeatherGlass  that by the rising and falling of a certain Magi∣cal Liquor presages all Changes and Revolu∣tions in Government as the common Glass does those of the Weather This WeatherGlass is said to have been invented by  Cardan  and given by him as a Present to his great Countryman and Contemporary  Machiavel  which by the Way may serve to rectify a received Error in Chronology that places one of these some Years after the other How or when it came into my Hands I shall desire to be excused if I keep to my self but so it is that I have walked by it for the better Part of a Century to my Safety at least if not to my Advantage and have among my Papers a Register of all the Changes that have happened in it from the Middle of Queen  Elizabeth  's Reign  In the Time of that Princess it stood long at  settled Fair  At the latter End of King  James  the First it fell to  Cloudy  It held several Years after at  Stormy  insomuch that at last despairing of seeing any  Clear  Weather at Home I follow'd the Royal Exile and some Time after finding my Glass rise returned to my native Country with the rest of the Loyalists I was then in  Hopes to pass the Remainder of my Days in  set∣tled Fair  But alas during the greatest Part of that Reign the  English  Nation lay in a  dead Calm  which as it is usual was followed by high Winds and Tempests till of late Years In which with unspeakable Joy and Satisfaction I have seen our Political Weather returned to  settled Fair  I must only observe that for all this last Summer my Glass has pointed at Changeable Upon the whole I often apply to Fortune  Aenaeas  's Speech to the Sybil  Non ulla Laborum  O Virgo nova mi Facies inopinave surgit  Omnia praecepi at{que} Animo mecum ante peregi  The Advantages which have accured to those whom I have advised in their Affairs by Vertue of this Sort of Praescience have been very consi∣derable A Nephew of mine who has never put his Money into the Stocks or taken it out without my Advice has in a few Years raised Five hundred Pounds to almost so many Thou∣sands As for my self who look upon Riches to consist rather in Content than Possessions and measure the Greatness of the Mind rather by its Tranquility than its Ambition I have seldom used my Glass to make my Way in the World but often to retire from it This is a ByPath to Happiness which was first discovered to me by a most pleasing Apothegm of  Pythagoras When the Winds  says he  rise worship the Eccho  That great Philosopher whether to make his Doctrines the more venerable or to guild his Precepts with the Beauty of Imagination or to awaken the Curiosity of his Disciples for I will not sup∣pose what is usually said that he did it to conceal his Wisdom from the Vulgar has couched seve∣ral admirable Precepts in remote Allusions and mysterious Sentences By the Winds in this Apo∣thegm are meant StateHurricanes and popular  Tumults When these

 Tuesday Aug  to  Thursday Aug    From my own Apartment  August  LYsander  has writ to me out of the Country and tells me after many other Circum∣stances that he had passed a great deal of Time with much Pleasure and Tranquility till his Happiness was interrupted by an indiscreet Flat∣terer who came down into those Parts to visit a Relation With the Circumstances in which he represents the Matter he had no small Provoca∣tion to be offended for he attacked him in so wrong a Season that he could not have any Re∣lish of Pleasure in it tho' perhaps at another Time it might have passed upon him without giving him much Uneasiness  Lysander  had af∣ter a long Satiety of the Town been so happy as to get to a Solitude he extremely liked and re∣covered a Pleasure he had long discontinued that of Reading He was got to the Bank of a Ri∣vulet covered by a pleasing Shade and fanned by a soft Breeze which threw his Mind into that Sort of Composure and Attention in which a Man though with Indolence enjoys the utmost Liveliness of his Spirits and the greatest Strength of his Mind at the same Time In this State  Lysander  represents that he was reading  Virgil  's  Georgicks  when on a sudden the Gentleman abovementioned surprised him and without any  Manner of Preparation falls upon him at once  'What I have found you out at last after searching all over the Wood We wanted you at Cards after Dinner but you are much better employed I have heard indeed that you are an excellent Scholar But at the same Time is it not a little unkind to rob the Ladies who like you so well of the Pleasure of your Com∣pany But that is indeed the Misfortune of you great Scholars you are seldom so fit for the World as those who never trouble themselves with Books Well I see you are taken up with your Learning there and I'll leave you'  Ly∣sander  says he made him no Answer but took a Resolution to complain to me  It is a substantial Affliction when Men govern themselves by the Rules of good Breeding that by the very Force of them they are subjected to the Insolence of those who either never will or never can understand them The superficial Part of Mankind form to themselves little Mea∣sures of Behaviour from the Outside of Things By the Force of these narrow Conceptions they act amongst themselves with Applause and do not apprehend they are contemptible to those of higher Understanding who are restrained by De∣cencies above their Knowledge from showing a Dislike Hence it is that because Complaisance is a good Quality in Conversation one Imperti∣nent takes upon him on all Occasions to com∣mend and because Mirth is agreeable another thinks fit eternally to jest I have of late re∣ceived many Packets of Letters complaining of these spreading Evils A Lady who is lately ar∣rived at the  Bath  acquaints me there was in the StageCoach wherein she went down a common Flatterer and a common Jester These Gentle∣men were she tells me Rivals in her Favour and adds If there ever happened a Case wherein of Two Persons One was not liked more than  another it was in that Journey They differed only in Proportion to the Degree of Dislike be∣tween the Nauseous and the Insipid Both these Characters of Men are born out of a Barrenness of Imagination They are never Fools by Na∣ture but become such out of an impotent Ambi∣tion of being what she never intended them Men of Wit and Conversation I therefore think fit to declare That according to the known Laws of this Land a Man may be a very honest Gen∣tleman and enjoy himself and his Friend with∣out being a Wit and I absolve all Men from ta∣king Pains to be such for the future As the pre∣sent Case stands is it not very unhappy that  Ly∣sander  must be attacked and applauded in a Wood and  Corinna  jolted and commended in a StageCoach and this for no manner of Reason but because other People have a Mind to show their Parts I grant indeed if these People as they have Understanding enough for it would confine their Accomplishments to those of their own Degree of Talents it were to be tolerated but when they are so insolent as to interrupt the Meditations of the Wise the Conversations of the Agreeable and the whole Behaviour of the Modest it becomes a Grievance naturally in my Jurisdiction Among themselves I cannot only overlook but approve it I was present the o∣ther Day at a Conversation where a Man of this Height of Breeding and Sense told a young Wo∣man of the same Form To be sure Madam eve∣ry Thing must please that comes from a Lady She answer'd I know Sir you are so much a Gentleman that you think so Why this is very well on both Sides and it is impossible that such a Gentleman and Lady should do other than think well of one another These are but loose Hints of the Disturbances in humane Society of which there is yet no Remedy But I shall in a little Time publish Tables of Respect and Civility by  which Persons may be instructed in the proper Times and Seasons as well as at what Degree of Intimacy a Man may be allowed to commend or rally his Companions the promiscuous Licence of which is at present far from being among the small Errors in Conversation  P S  The following Letter was left with a Re∣quest to be immediately answered lest the Arti∣fices used against a Lady in Distress may come into common Practice  SIR  MY elder Sister buried her Husband about Six Months ago and at his Funeral a Gentle∣man of more Art than Honesty on the Night of his Interrment while she was not her self but in the utmost Agony of her Grief spoke to

Wisdom less than Infinite For this Reason I would not discourage any Searches that are made into the most minute and trivial Parts of the Creation However since the World a∣bounds in the noblest Fields of Speculation it is methinks the Mark of a little Genius to be wholly conversant among Insects Reptiles Ani∣malcules and those trifling Rarities that furnish out the Apartment of a Virtuoso  There are some Men whose Heads are so odly turned this Way that tho' they are utter Stran∣gers to the common Occurrences of Life they are able to discover the Sex of a Cockle or de∣scribe the

than he would upon a Flock of Sheep and has sold his Coat off his Back to purchase a Tarantula  I would not have a Scholar wholly unacquaint∣ed with these Secrets and Curiosities of Nature but certainly the Mind of Man that is capable of  so much higher Contemplations should not be altogether fixed upon such mean and dispropor∣tioned Objects Observations of this Kind are apt to alienate us too much from the Knowledge of the World and to make us serious upon Tri∣fles by which Means they expose Philosophy to the Ridicule of the Witty and Contempt of the Ignorant In short Studies of this Nature should be the Diversions Relaxations and Amusements not the Care Business and Concern of Life  It is indeed wonderful to consider that there should be a Sort of learned Men who are wholly

to  Tuesd Aug    From my own Apartment  Aug  AS I was passing by a Neighbour's House this Morning I overheard the Wife of the Fa∣mily speak Things to her Husband which gave me much Disturbance and put me in Mind of a Character which I wonder I have so long omit∣ted and that is an outragious Species of the Fair Sex which is distinguished by the Term Scolds The Generality of Women are by Na∣ture loquacious Therefore meer Volubility of Speech is not to be imputed to them but should be considered with Pleasure when it is used to ex∣press such Passions as tend to sweeten or adorn Conversation But when thro' Rage Females are vehement in their Eloquence nothing in the World has so ill an Effect upon the Features for by the Force of it I have seen the most Amiable become the most Deformed and she that ap∣peared one of the Graces immediately turned into one of the Furies I humbly conceive the great Cause of this Evil may proceed from a false Notion the Ladies have of what we call a Modest Woman They have too narrow a Conception of this lovely Character and believe they have not at all forfeited their Pretensions to it provided they have no Imputations on their Chastity But alas the young Fellows know they pick out bet∣ter Women in the SideBoxes than many of those who pass upon the World and themselves for Mo∣dest  Modesty never rages never murmurs never pouts When it is ill treated it pines it be∣seeches it languishes The Neighbour I men∣tion is one of your common modest Women that is to say those as are ordinarily reckoned such Her Husband knows every Pain in Life with her but Jealousy Now because she is clear in this Particular the Man can't say his Soul's his own but she cries No modest Woman is respected now adays What adds to the Comedy in this Case is that it is very ordinary with this Sort of Women to talk in the Language of Distress They will complain of the forlorn Wretchedness of their Condition and then the poor helpless Creatures shall throw the next Thing they can lay their Hands on at the Person who offends them Our Neighbour was only saying to his Wife she went a little too fine when she imme∣diately pulled his Periwig off and stamping it under her Feet wrung her Hands and said Ne∣ver modest Woman was so used These Ladies of irresistible Modesty are those who make Vir∣tue unamiable not that they can be said to be virtuous but as they live without Scandal and being under the common Denomination of being such Men fear to meet their Faults in those who are as agreeable as they are innocent  I take the Bully among Men and the Scold a∣mong Women to draw the Foundation of their Actions from the same Defect in the Mind A Bully thinks Honour consists wholly in being brave and therefore has Regard to no one Rule of Life if he preserves himself from the Accusa∣tion of Cowardize The froward Woman knows Chastity to be the first Merit in a Woman and therefore since no one can call her one ugly Name she calls all Mankind all the rest  These Ladies where their Companions are so imprudent as to take their Speeches for any other than Exercises of their own Lungs and their  Husbands Patience gain by the Force of being resisted and flame with open Fury which is no Way to be opposed but by being neglected Tho' at the same Time Humane Frailty makes it very hard to relish the Philosophy of contemning even frivolous Reproach There is a very pretty In∣stance of this Infirmity in the Man of the best Sense that ever was no less a Person than  Adam  himself According to  Milton  's Description of the First Couple as soon as they had fallen and the turbulent Passions of Anger Hatred and Jea∣lousy first enter'd their Breasts  Adam  grew moody and talked to his Wife as you may find it in the th Page and th Book of  Paradise Lest  in the  Octave  Edition which out of He∣roicks and put into Domestick Stile would run thus  'Madam If my Advice had been of any Au∣thority with you when that strange Desire of Gadding possessed you this Morning we had still been happy But your cursed Vanity and Opi∣nion of your own Conduct which is certainly very wavering when it seeks Occasions of being proved has ruined both your self and me who trusted you'  Eve  had no Fan in her Hand to ruffle or Tucker to pull down but with a reproachful Air she an∣swered  Sir Do you impute that to my Desire of Gad∣ding which might have happened to your self with all your Wisdom and Gravity'  The Ser∣pent spoke so excellently and with so good a Grace thatBesides  'What Harm had I ever done him that he should design me any Was I to have been always at your Side I might as well have continued there and been but your Rib still But if I was so weak a Creature as you thought me Why did you not interpose your sage Authority more absolutely  You denied me going as faintly as you say I resisted the Serpent Had not you been too easie neither you or I had now transgressed'  Adam  replied  'Why  Eve  hast thou the Im∣pudence to upbraid me as the Cause of thy Transgression for my Indulgence to thee Thus it will ever be with him who trusts too much to Woman At the same Time that she refuses to be governed if she suffers by her Ostinacy she will accuse the Man that shall leave her to her self'  Thus they in mutual Accusation spent  The fruitless Hours but neither self condemning  And of their vain Contest appear'd no End  This to the Modern will appear but a very faint Piece of Conjugal Enmity but you are to consider that they were but just begun to be an∣gry and they wanted new Words for expressing their new Passions But her accusing him of let∣ting her go and telling him how good a Speaker and how fine a Gentleman the Devil was we must reckon allowing for the Improvements of Time that she gave him the same Provocation as if she had called him Cuckold The pas∣sionate and familiar Terms with which the same Case repeated daily for so many Thousand Years has furnished the present Generation were not then in Use but the Foundation of Debate has ever been the same a Contention about their Merit and Wisdom Our general Mother was a Beauty and hearing there was another now in the World could not forbear as  Adam  tells her showing her self though to the Devil by whom the same Vanity made her liable to be be∣trayed  I cannot with all the Help of Science and Astrology find any other Remedy for this Evil but what was the Medicine in this first Quarrel which was as appeared in the next Book that  they were convinced of their being both weak but one weaker than the other  If it were possible that the Beauteous could but rage a little before a Glass and see their pret∣ty Countenances grow wild it is not to be doubt∣ed but it would have a very good Effect but that would require Temper For Lady  Firebrand  upon observing her Features swell when her Maid vexed her the other Day stamped her DressingGlass under her Feet In this Case when one of this Temper is moved she is like a Witch in an Operation and makes all Things turn round with her The very Fabrick is in a Vertigo when she begins to charm In an In∣stant whatever was the Occasion that moved her Blood she has such intolerable Servants  Betty  is so aukward  Tom  can't carry a Message and her Husband has so little Respect for her that she poor Woman is weary of this Life and was born to be unhappy  Desunt Multa  ADVERTISEMENT  The Season now

with so many delightful Instincts created in me the same Kind of animal Pleasure and made my Heart overflow with such secret Emotions of Joy and Satisfaction as are not to be described or ac∣counted for On this Occasion I could not but reflect upon a beautiful Simile in  Milton  As one who long in populous City pent  Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Air  Forth issuing on a Summer's Morn to breath  Among the pleasant Villages and Farms  Adjoin'd from each Thing met conceives Delight  The Smell of Grain or tedded Grass or Kine  Or Dairy each rural Sight each rural Sound  Those who are conversant in the Writings of po∣lite Authors receive an additional Entertainment from the Country as it revives in their Memories those charming Descriptions with which such Authors do frequently abound  I was thinking of the foregoing beautiful Si∣mile in  Milton  and applying it to my self when I observed to the Windward of me a black Cloud falling to the Earth in long Trails of Rain which made me betake my self for Shelter to a House which I saw at a little Distance from the Place where I was walking As I sat in the Porch I heard the Voices of Two or Three Persons who seemed very earnest in Discourse My Curiosity was raised when I heard the Names of  Alexander the Great  and  Artaxerxes  and as their Talk seemed to run on ancient Heroes I concluded there could not be any Secret in it for which Reason I thought I might very fairly listen to what they said  After several Parallels between great Men which appeared to me altogether groundless and chimerical I was surprized to hear one say That he valued the  Black Prince  more than the Duke of  Vendosme  How the Duke of  Vendosme  should become a Rival of the  Black Prince  's I could not conceive And was more startled when I heard a Second affirm with great Vehemence That if the Emperor of  Germany  was not going off he should like him better than either of them He added That tho' the Season was so changeable the Duke of  Marlborough  was in blooming Beau∣ty I was wondering to my self from whence they had received this odd Intelligence especial∣ly when I heard them mention the Names of se∣veral other great Generals as the Prince of  Hesse  and the King of  Sweden  who they said were both running away To which they added what I entirely agreed with them in That the Crown of  France  was very weak but that the Mareschal  Villars  still kept his Colours At last one of them told the Company If they would go along with him he would show them a ChimneySweeper and a Painted Lady in the same Bed which he was sure would very much please them The Shower which had driven them as well as my self into the House was now over And as they were passing by me into the Garden I asked them to let me be one of their Company  The Gentleman of the House told me if I de∣lighted in Flowers it would be worth my while for that he believed he could show me such a Blow of Tulips as was not to be matched in the whole Country  I accepted the Offer and immediately found that they had been talking in Terms of Garden∣ing and that the Kings and Generals they had mentioned were only so many Tulips to which the Gardiners according to their usual Custom had given such high Titles and Appellations of Honour  I was very much pleased and astonished at the glorious Show of these gay Vegetables that arose in great Profusion on all the Banks about us Sometimes I considered them with the Eye of an ordinary Spectator as so many beautiful Objects varnished over with a natural Gloss and stained with such a Variety of Colours as are not to be equalled in any artificial Dyes or Tinctures Sometimes I considered every Leaf as an elabo∣rate Piece of Tissue in which the Threads and Fibres were woven together into different Confi∣gurations which gave a different Colouring to the Light as it glanced on the several Parts of the Surface Sometimes I considered the whole Bed of Tulips according to the Notion of the greatest Mathematician and Philosopher that ever lived as a Multitude of Optick Instruments designed for the separating Light into all those various Co∣lours of which it is composed  I was awakened out of these my Philosophical Speculations by observing the Company often seemed to laugh at me I accidentally praised a Tulip as one of the finest that I ever saw upon which they told me 'twas a common Fool'sCoat Upon that I praised a Second which it seems was but another Kind of Fool'sCoat I had the same Fate with Two or Three more for which Reason I desired the Owner of the Garden to let me know which were the finest of the Flowers for that I was so unskilful in the Art that I thought the most beautiful were the most valua∣ble and that those which had the gayest Colours were the most beautiful The Gentleman smiled at my Ignorance He seemed a very plain honest Man and a Person of good Sense had not his Head been touched with that Distemper which  Hippocrates  calls the    Tulippomania  insomuch that he would talk very rationally on any Subject in the World but a Tulip  He told me That he valued the Bed of Flowers which lay before us and was not above Twenty Yards in Length and Two in Breadth more than he would the best Hundred Acres of Land in  England  and added That it would have been worth twice the Money it is if a foolish CookMaid of his had not almost ruined him the last Winter by mistaking an Handful of TulipRoots for an Heap of Onions and by that Means says he made me a Dish of Porridge that cost me above  l  Sterling He then showed me what he thought the finest of his Tulips which I found received all their Value from their Rarity and Oddness and put me in Mind of your great For∣tunes which are not always the greatest Beau∣ties  I have often looked upon it as a Piece of Hap∣piness that I have never fallen into any of these fantastical Tasts nor esteemed any Thing the more for its being uncommon and hard to be met  with For this Reason I look upon the whole Country in Springtime as a spacious Garden and make as many Visits to a Spot of Daizies or a Bank of Violets as a Florist does to his Bor∣ders and Parterres There is not a Bush in Blos∣som within a Mile of me which I am not ac∣quainted with nor scarce a Daffodil or Cowslip that withers away in my Neighbourhood with∣out my missing it I walked Home in this Tem∣per of Mind through several Fields and Meadows with an unspeakable Pleasure not without re∣flecting on the Bounty of Providence which has made the most pleasing and most beautiful Ob∣jects the most ordinary and most common  The TATLER N  o    Solutos  Qui captat Risus Hominum Famam{que} Dicacis  Affectat niger est hunc tu Romane caveto  From  Thursd Aug  to  Saturd Sept    From my own Apartment  Sept  NEver were Men so perplexed as a select Com∣pany of us were this Evening with a Cou∣ple of professed Wits who through our ill For∣tune and their own Confidence had thought fit to pin themselves upon a Gentleman who had owned to them that he was going to meet such and such Persons and named us one by one These pert Puppies immediately resolved to come with him and from the Beginning to the End of the Night entertained each other with Imperti∣nencies to which we were perfect Strangers I am come Home very much tired for the Affli∣ction  was so irksome to me that it surpasses all other I ever knew insomuch that I cannot re∣flect upon this Sorrow with Pleasure though it is past  An easy Manner of Conversation is the most desirable Quality a Man can have and for that Reason Coxcombs will take upon them to be fa∣miliar with People whom they never saw before What adds to the Vexation of it is that they will act upon the Foot of knowing you by Fame and rally with you as they call it by repeating what your Enemies say of you and court you as they think by uttering to your Face at a wrong Time all the kind Things your Friends speak of you in your Absence  These People are the more dreadful the more they have of what is usually called Wit For a lively Imagination when it is not governed by a good Understanding makes such miserable Ha∣vock both in Conversation and Business that it lays you defenceless and fearful to throw the least Word in its Way that may give it new Matter for its further Errors  Tom Mercett  has as quick a Fancy as any one li∣ving but there is no reasonable Man can bear him half an Hour His Purpose is to entertain and it is of no Consequence to him what is said so it be what is called well said as if a Man must bear a Wound with Patience because he that pushed at you came up with a good Air and Mien That Part of Life which we spend in Company is the most pleasing of all our Mo∣ments and therefore I think our Behaviour in it should have its Laws as well as the Part of our Being which is generally esteemed the more im∣portant From hence it is that from long Expe∣rience I have made it a Maxim that however we may pretend to take Satisfaction in sprightly Mirth and high Jollity there is no great Pleasure in any Company where the Basis of the Society  is not mutual GoodWill When this is in the Room every trifling Circumstance the most mi∣nute Accident the Absurdity of a Servant the Repetition of an old Story the Look of a Man when he is telling it the most indifferent and the most ordinary Occurrences are Matters which produce Mirth and good Humour I went to spend an Hour after this Manner with some Friends who enjoy it in Perfection whenever they meet when those Destroyers abovementioned came in upon us There is not a Man among them has any Notion of Distinction of Superiori∣ty to one another either in their Fortunes or their Talents when they are in Company Or if any Reflexion to the contrary occurs in their Thoughts it only strikes a Delight upon their Minds that so much Wisdom and Power is in Possession of one whom they love and esteem  In these my Lucubrations I have frequently dwelt upon this one Topick It would make short Work for us Reformers for it is only Want of making this a Position that renders some Cha∣racters bad which would otherwise be good  Tom Mercett  means no Man Ill but does Ill to every Body His Ambition is to be witty and to carry on that Design he breaks through all Things that other People hold Sacred If he thought Wit was no Way to be used but to the Advantage of Society that Sprightliness would have a new Turn and we should expect what he is going to say with Satisfaction instead of Fear It is no Excuse for being mischievous that a Man is mischievous without Malice nor will it be thought an Attonement that the Ill was done not to injure the Party concern'd but to di∣vert the Indifferent  It is methinks a very great Error that we should not profess Honesty in Conversation as much as in Commerce If we consider that there is no greater Misfortune than to be ill re∣ceived  where we love the turning a Man to Ridi∣cule among his Friends we rob him of greater Enjoyments than he could have purchased by his Wealth yet he that laughs at him would per∣haps be the last Man who would hurt him in this Case of less Consequence It has been said the History of  Don Quixote  utterly destroyed the Spi∣rit of Gallantry in the  Spanish  Nation and I be∣lieve we may say much more truly that the Hu∣mour of Ridicule has done as much Injury to the true Relish of Company in  England  Such Satisfactions as arise from the secret Com∣parison of our selves to others with relation to their inferior Fortunes or Merit are mean and unworthy The true and high State of Conver∣sation is when Men communicate their Thoughts to each other upon such Subjects and in such a Manner as would be pleasant if there were no such Thing as Folly in the World for it is but a low Condition of Wit in one Man which de∣pends upon Folly in another  P S  I was here interrupted by the Receipt of my Letters among which is one from a Lady who is not a little offended at my Translation of the Discourse between  Adam  and  Eve  She pre∣tends to tell me my own as she calls it and quotes several Passages in my Works which tend to the utter Disunion of Man and Wife Her Epistle will best express her I have made an Extract of it and shall insert the most material Passages  I suppose you know we Women are not too apt to forgive For which Reason before you concern your self any further

what you please without admitting others to take the same Liberty Marry come up  You a Censor Pray read over all these Pam∣phlets and these Notes upon your Lucubra∣tions by that Time you shall hear further It is I suppose from such as you that People learn to be Sensorious for which I and all our Sex have an utter Aversion when once People come to take the Liberty to wound Reputa∣tions  This is

Insani sanus Nomen ferat aequus iniqui  Ultra quam satis est Virtutem si petat ipsam  Hor  From  Saturd Sept  to  Tuesd Sept    From my own Apartment  Sept  HAving received many Letters filled with Compliments and Acknowledgments for my late useful Discovery of the Political Barome∣ter I shall here communicate to the Publick an Account of my Ecclesiastical Thermometer the latter giving as manifest Prognostications of the Changes and Revolutions in Church as the for∣mer does of those in State and both of them be∣ing absolutely necessary for every prudent Subject who is resolved to keep what he has and get what he can  The Church Thermometer which I am now to treat of is supposed to have been invented in the Reign of  Henry  the Eighth about the Time when that Religious Prince put some to Death for owning the Pope's Supremacy and others for denying Transubstantiation I do not find how∣ever any great Use made of this Instrument till it fell into the Hands of a learned and vigilant Priest or Minister for he frequently wrote him∣self both one and the other who was some Time Vicar of  Bray  This Gentleman lived in his Vi∣caridge to a good old Age and after having seen several Successions of his neighbouring Clergy either burnt or banish'd departed this Life with the Satisfaction of having never deserted his  Flock and died Vicar of  Bray  As this Glass was first designed to calculate the different De∣grees of Heat in Religion as it raged in Popery or as it cooled and grew temperate in the Refor∣mation it was marked at several Distances after the Manner our ordinary Thermometer is to this Day  viz Extream Hot sultry Hot very Hot Hot Warm Temperate Cold just Freezing Frost hard Frost great Frost extream Cold  It is well known that  Toricellius  the Inventor of the common WeatherGlass made the Experi∣ment in a long Tube which held Thirty two Foot of Water and that a more modern Virtuoso finding such a Machine altogether unweildy and useless and considering that Thirty two Inches of Quicksilver weigh'd as much as so many Foot of Water in a Tube of the same Circumference invented that fizeable Instrument which is now in Use After this Manner that I might adapt the Thermometer I am now speaking of to the present Constitution of our Church as divided into  High  and  Low  I have made some necessary Vari∣ations both in the Tube and the Fluid it contains In the first Place I ordered a Tube to be cast in a Planetary Hour and took Care to seal it Her∣metically when the Sun was in Conjunction with  Saturn  I then took the proper Precautions about the Fluid which is a Compound of Two very different Liquors one of them a Spirit drawn out of a strong heady Wine the other a parti∣cular Sort of Rock Water colder than Ice and clearer than Chrystal The Spirit is of a red fiery Colour and so very apt to ferment that unless it be mingled with a Proportion of the Water or pent up very close it will burst the Vessel that holds it and fly up in Fume and Smoak The Water on the contrary is of such a subtle piercing Cold that unless it be mingled with a Proportion of the Spirits it will sink through almost every Thing that it is put into and seems to be of the  same Nature as the Water mentioned by  Quintus Curtius  which says the Historian could be con∣tained in nothing but in the Hoof or as the  Ox∣ford  Manuscript has it in the Skull of an Ass The Thermometer is marked according to the following Figure which I set down at length not only to give my Reader a clear Idea of it but also to fill up my Paper  Ignorance  Persecution  Wrath  Zeal  CHURCH  Moderation  Lukewarmness  Infidelity  Ignorance  The Reader will observe that the Church is placed in the Middle Point of the Glass between  Zeal  and  Moderation  the Situation in which she always flourishes and in which every good  Eng∣lishman  wishes her who is a Friend to the Con∣stitution of his Country However when it mounts to  Zeal  it is not amiss and when it sinks to  Moderation  is still in a most admirable Temper The worst of it is that when once it begins to rise it has still an Inclination to ascend insomuch that it is apt to climb from  Zeal  to  Wrath  and from  Wrath  to  Persecution  which al∣ways ends in  Ignorance  and very often proceeds from it In the same Manner it frequently takes its Progress through the lower Half of the Glass and when it has a Tendency to fall will gradual∣ly descend from  Moderation  to  Lukewarmness  and  from  Lukewarmness  to  Infidelity  which very often terminates in  Ignorance  and always proceeds from it  It is a common Observation that the ordinary Thermometer will be affected by the breathing of People who are in the Room where it stands and indeed it is almost incredible to conceive how the Glass I am now describing will fall by the Breath of a Multitude crying  Popery  or on the contrary how it will rise when the same Multi∣tude as it sometimes happens cry out in the same Breath  The Church is in Danger  As soon as I had finished this my Glass and ad∣justed it to the abovementioned Scale of Reli∣gion that I might make proper Experiments with it I carried it under my Cloak to several Coffeehouses and other Places of Resort about this great City At St  James  's Coffeehouse the Li∣quor stood at  Moderation  but at  Will  's to my extream Surprize it subsided to the very lowest Mark on the Glass At the  Grecian  it mounted but just one Point higher at the  Rainbow  it still ascended Two Decrees  Child  's fetched it up to  Zeal  and other adjacent Coffeehouses to  Wrath  It fell into the lower Half of the Glass as I went further into the City till at length it set∣tled at  Moderation  where it continued all the Time I stay'd about the  Change  as also whilst I passed by the  Bank  And here I cannot but take Notice that through the whole Course of my Remarks I never observed my Glass to rise at the same Time that the Stocks did  To compleat the Experiment I prevailed upon a Friend of mine who works under me in the Occult Sciences to make a Progress with my Glass through the whole Island of  Great Bri∣tain  and after his Return to present me with a Register of his Observations I guessed before∣hand at the Temper of several Places he passed through by the Characters they have had Time  out of Mind Thus that facetious Divine Dr  Ful∣ler  speaking of the Town of  Banbury  near a Hundred Years ago tells us it was a Place fa∣mous for Cakes and  Zeal  which I find by my Glass is true to this Day as to the latter Part of this Description though I must confess it is not in the same Reputation for Cakes that it was in the Time of that learned Author and thus of other Places In short I have now by me di∣gested in an Alphabetical Order all the Counties Corporations and Boroughs in  Great Britain  with their respective Tempers as they stand re∣lated to my Thermometer But this I shall keep to my self because I would by no Means do any Thing that may seem to influence any ensuing Elections  The Point of Doctrine which I would propa∣gate by this my Invention is the same which was long ago advanced by that able Teacher  Ho∣race  out of whom I have taken my Text for this Discourse We should be careful not to over∣shoot our selves in the Pursuits even of Virtue Whether  Zeal  or  Moderation  be the Point we aim at let us keep Fire out of the one and Frost out of the other But alas the World is too Wise to want such a Precaution The Terms  HighChurch  and  LowChurch  as commonly used do not so much denote a Principle as they distin∣guish a Party They are like Words of Battle that have nothing to do with their original Sig∣nification but are only given out to keep a Body of Men together and to let them know Friends from Enemies  I must confess I have considered with some lit∣tle Attention the Influence which the Opinions of these great National Sects have upon their Pra∣ctice and do look upon it as one of the unac∣countable Things of our Times that Multitudes of honest Gentlemen who entirely agree in their  Lives should take it in their Heads to differ in their Religion  The TATLER N  o    Sicut meus est Mos  Nescio quid meditans Nugarum totus in illis  Hor  From  Tuesday Sept  to  Thursday Sept    From my own Apartment  Sept  AS I was this Morning going out of my House a little Boy in a black Coat delivered to me the following Letter Upon asking who he was he told me that he belonged to my Lady  Gim∣crack  I did not at first recollect the Name but upon Enquiry found it to be the Widow of Sir  Nicholas  whose Legacy I lately gave some Account of to the World The Letter ran thus  Mr  Bickerstaff  I Hope you will not be surprised to receive a Letter from the Widow  Gimcrack  You know Sir that I have lately lost a very whim∣sical Husband who I find by one of your last Weeks Papers was not altogether a Stranger to you When I married this Gentleman he had a very handsome Estate but upon buying a Set of Microscopes he was chosen a Fellow of the Royal Society from which Time I do not remember ever to have heard him speak as other People did or talk in a Manner that any of his Family could understand him He used however to pass away his Time very in∣nocently in Conversation with several Mem∣ber  of that learned Body for which Reason I never advised him against their Company for several Years till at last I found his Brain was quite turned with their Discourses The first Symptom which he discovered of his being a Virtuoso as you call him poor Man was about Fifteen Years ago when he gave me positive Orders to turn off an old WeedingWoman that had been employed in the Family for several Years He told me at the same Time that there was no such Thing in Na∣ture as a Weed and that it was his Design to let his Garden produce what it pleased so that you may be sure it makes a very pleasant Show as it now lies About the same Time he took a Humour to ramble up and down the Country and would often bring Home with him his Pockets full of Moss and Pebbles This you may be sure gave me a heavy Heart though at the same Time I must needs say he had the Character of a very honest Man notwithstanding he was reckon'd a little weak till he begun to sell his Estate and buy those strange Baubles that you have taken Notice of Upon  MidsummerDay  last as he was walking with me in the Fields he saw a very odd coloured Butterfly just before us I observed that he immediately chan∣ged Colour like a Man that is surprised with a Piece of good Luck and telling me that it was what he had looked for above these Twelve Years he threw off his Coat and followed it I lost Sight of them both in less than a quarter of an Hour but my Husband continued the Chace over Hedge and Ditch till about Sunset at which Time as I was afterwards told he caught the Butterfly as she rested her self upon a Cab∣bage near Five Miles from the Place where he first put her up He was here lifted  from the Ground by some Passengers in a very fainting Condition and brought Home to me about Midnight His violent Exer∣cise threw him into a Fever which grew upon him by Degrees and at last carried him off In one of the Intervals of his Di∣stemper he called to me and after having excused himself for running out of his E∣state he told me That he had always been more industrious to improve his Mind than his Fortune and that his Family must ra∣ther value themselves upon his Memory as he was a wise Man than a rich one He then told me That it was a Custom a∣mong the  Romans  for a Man to give his Slaves their Liberty when he lay upon his DeathBed I could not imagine what this meant till after having a little composed himself he ordered me to bring him a Flea which he had kept for several Months in a Chain with a Design as he said to give it its Ma∣numission This was done accordingly He then made the Will which I have since seen printed in your Works Word for Word On∣ly I must take Notice that you have omitted the Codicil in which he left a large  Concha Veneris  as it is there called to a Member of the Royal Society who was often with him in his Sickness and assisted him in his Will And now Sir I come to the chief Bu∣siness of my Letter which is to desire your Friendship and Assistance in the Disposal of those many Rarities and Curiosities which lie upon my Hands If you know any one that has an Occasion for a Parcel of dry'd Spiders I will sell them a Pennyworth I could like∣wise let any one have a Bargain of CockleShells I would also desire your Advice whe∣ther I had best sell my Beetles in a Lump or by Retail The Gentleman abovementioned  who was my Husband's Friend would have me make an Auction of all his Goods and is now drawing up a Catalogue of every Particu∣lar for that Purpose with the Two following Words in great Letters over the Head of them  Auctio Gimcrackiana  But upon talking with him I begin to suspect he is as mad as poor Sir  Nicholas  was Your Advice in all these Particulars will be a great Piece of Charity to  SIR  Your most humble Servant  Elizabeth Gimcrack  I shall answer the foregoing Letter and give the Widow my best Advice as soon as I can find out Chapmen for the Wares which she has to put off In the mean Time I shall give my Reader the Sight of a Letter which I have re∣ceived from another Female Correspondent by the same Post  Good Mr  Bickerstaff  I Am convinced by a late Paper of yours that a passionate Woman which among the common People goes under the Name of a Scold is one of the most unsupportable Creatures in the World But alas Sir What can we do I have made a Thou∣sand Vows and Resolutions every Morning to guard my self against this Frailty but have generally broken them before Dinner and could never in my Life hold out till the Second Course was set upon the Table What most troubles me is that my Husband is as patient and goodnatured as you  own Worship or any Man living can be Pra  give me some Directions for I would observe th  strictest and severest Rules you can think of to cu  my self of this Distemper which is apt to fall into my Tongue every Moment I am  SIR  Your most humble Servant  c  In Answer to this most unfortunate Lady I must acquaint her That there is now in Town an ingenious Physician of my Acquaintance who undertakes to cure all the Vices and Defects of the Mind by inward Medicines or outward Applica∣tions I shall give the World an Account of his Patients and his Cures in other Papers when I shall be more at Leisure to treat upon this Subject I shall only here inform my Correspondent That for the Benefit of such Ladies that are troubled with virulent Tongues he has prepared a Cold Bath over which there is fastened at the End of a long Pole a very convenient Chair curious∣ly gilt and carved When the Patient is seated in this Chair the Doctor lifts up the Pole and gives her Two or Three total Emersions in the Cold Bath till such Time as she has quite lost the Use of Speech This Operation so effectually chills the Tongue and refrigerates the Blood that a Woman who at her Entrance into the Chair is extreamly passionate and sonorous will come out as silent and gentle as a Lamb The Doctor told me he would not practise this Expe∣riment upon Women of Fashion had not he seen it made upon those of meaner Condition with very good Effect  The TATLER N  o    Chrysidis Udas  Ebrius ante Fores extinct a cum Face cantat  Persius  From  Thursday Sept  to  Saturday Sept    From my own Apartment  September  WHereas by Letters from  Nottingham  we have Advice That the young Ladies of that Place complain for Want of Sleep by rea∣son of certain riotous Lovers who for this last Summer have very much infested the Streets of that eminent City with Violins and BassViols between the Hours of Twelve and Four in the Morning to the great Disturbance of many of Her Majesty's peaceable Subjects And whereas I have been im∣portuned to publish some Edict against these Mid∣night Alarms which under the Name of Sere∣nades do greatly annoy many welldisposed Per∣sons not only in the Place abovementioned but also in most of the Polite Towns of this Island  I have taken that Matter into my serious Con∣sideration and do find that this Custom is by no means to be indulged in this Country and Cli∣mate  It is indeed very unaccountable that most of our  British  Youth should take such great Delight in these Nocturnal Expeditions Your robust trueborn  Briton  that has not yet felt the Force of Flames and Darts has a natural Inclination to break Windows while th  se whose natural Rug∣gedness has been soothed and softened by gentle Passion have as strong a Propensity to languish under them especially if they have a Fidler be∣hind  them to utter their Complaints For as the Custom prevails at present there is scarce a young Man of any Fashion in a Corporation who does not make Love with the TownMusick The Waits often help him through his Courtship and my Friend Mr  Banister  has told me he was proffered Five hundred Pounds by a young Fellow to play but for one Winter under the Window of a Lady that was a great Fortune but more cruel than or∣dinary One would think they hoped to conquer their Mistresses Hearts as People tame Hawks and Eagles by keeping them awake or breaking their Sleep when they are fallen into it  I have endeavoured to search into the Original of this impertinent Way of making Love which according to some Authors is of great Anti∣quity If we may believe Monsieur  Dacier and  other Criticks  Horace  's Tenth Ode of the Third Book was originally a Serenade And if I was disposed to show my Learning I could produce a Line of him in another Place which seems to have been the Burthen of an old Heathen Sere∣nade  " Audis minus minus jam  Me tuo tongas pereunte Noctes  Lydia Dormis  But notwithstanding the Opinions of many lear∣ned Men upon this Subject I rather agree with them who look upon this Custom as now practi∣sed to have been introduced by castrated Musici∣ans who found out this Way of applying them∣selves to their Mistresses at these Hours when Men of hoarser Voices express their Passions in a more vulgar Method It must be confessed That your  Italian  Eunuchs do practise this Manner of Court∣ship to this Day  But whoever were the Persons that first thought of the Serenade the Authors of all Countries are unanimous in ascribing the invention to  Italy  There are Two Circumstances which qualified that Country above all other for this Midnight Musick  The first I shall mention was the Softness of their Climate  This gave the Lover Opportunities of being Abroad in the Air or of lying upon the Earth whole Hours together without Fear of Damps or Dews but as for our Tramontain Lovers when they begin their Midnight Complaint with  My Lodging it is on the cold Ground  We are not to understand them in the Rigour of the Letter since it would be impossible for a  Bri∣tish  Swain to condole himself long in that Situa∣tion without really dying for his Mistress A Man might as well serenade in  Greenland  as in our Re∣gion  Milton  seems to have had in his Thoughts the Absurdity of these Northern Serenades in the Censure which he passes upon them  Or Midnight Ball  Or Serenede which the Starv'd Lover sings  To his proud Fair best quitted with Disdain  The Truth of it is I have often pitied in a Win∣ter Night a Vocal Musician and have attributed many of his Trills and Quavers to the Coldness of the Weather  The second Circumstance which inclined the  Lalians  to this Custom was that Musical Genius which is so universal among them Nothing is more frequent in that Country than to hear a Cobler working to an Opera Tune You can scarce see a Porter that has not one Nail much longer than the rest which you will find upon Enquiry is cherished for some Instrument In short there is not a Labourer or Handicraft Man that in the Cool of the Evening does not relieve himself with Solo's and Sonnata's  The  Italian  fooths his Mistress with a plaintivee Voice and bewails himself in such melting Mu∣sick that the whole Neighbourhood sympathizes with him in his Sorrow  Qualis Populea maerens Philomela sub Umbra  Flet Noctem Rame{que} sedens miserabile Carmen  Integrat late moestis Loca Quaestibus implet  On the contrary our honest Countrymen have so little an Inclination

the Coldness of Wives to their Husbands as well as Disrespect from Chil∣dren to Parents to arise from this one Source This Trade for Minds and Bodies in the Lump without Regard to either but as they are accom∣panied with such Sums of Money and such Par∣ceis of Land cannot but produce a Commerce between the Parties concerned suitable to the mean Motives upon which they at first came to∣gether I have heretofore given an Account that this Method of making Settlements was first in∣vented by a griping Lawyer who made Use of the covetous Tempers of the Parents of each Side to force Two young People into these vile Mea∣sures of Diffidence for no other End but to en∣crease the Skins of Parchment by which they were put into each other's Possession out of each other's Power The Law of our Country has given an ample and generous Provision for the Wife even the Third of the Husband's Estate and left to her good Humour and his Gratitude the Expectation of further Provision but the fantasti∣cal Method of going further with relation to their Heirs has a Foundation in nothing but Pride and Folly For as all Men wish their Children as like themselves and as much better as they can possi∣bly it seems monstrous that we should give out of our selves the Opportunities of rewarding and discouraging them according to their Deserts This wise Institution has no more Sense in it than if a Man should begin a Deed with  "Whereas no Man living knows how long he shall conti∣nue to be a reasonable Creature or an honest Man And whereas I  B  am going to enter in the State of Matrimony with Mrs  D  therefore I shall from henceforth make it indifferent to me whether from this Time forward I shall be a Fool or a Knave And therefore in full and per∣fect  Health of Body and as sound Mind not knowing which of my Children will prove bet∣ter or worse I give to my Firstborn be he per∣verse ungrateful impious or cruel the Lump and Bulk of my Estate and leave one Year's Purchase only to each of my younger Children whether they shall be brave or beautiful modest or honourable from the Time of the Date hereof wherein I resign my Senses and hereby promise to employ my Judgment no further in the Di∣stribution of my Worldly Goods from the Day of the Date hereof hereby further confessing and covenanting that I am from henceforth married and dead in Law'  There is no Man that is conversant in modern Settlements but knows this is an exact Transla∣tion of what is inserted in these Instruments Men's Passions could only make them submit to such Terms and therefore all unreasonable Bar∣gains in Marriage ought to be set aside as well as Deeds extorted from Men under Force or in Prison who are altogether as much Masters of their Actions as he that is possess'd with a violent Passion  How strangely Men are sometimes partial to themselves appears by the Rapine of him that has a Daughter's Beauty under his Direction He will make no Scruple of using it to force from her Lo∣ver as much of his Estate as is worth  l  and at the same Time as a Justice on the Bench will spare no Pains to get a Man hanged that has taken but a Horse from him  It is to be hoped the Legislature will in due Time take this Kind of Robbery into Considera∣tion and not suffer Men to prey upon each other when they are about making the most solemn League and entring into the strictest Bonds The only sure Remedy is to fix a certain Rate on every Woman's Fortune one Price for that of a Maid  and another for a Widow For it is of infinite Advantage that there should be no Frauds or Un∣certainties in the Sale of our Women  If any Man should exceed the settled Rate he ought to be at Liberty after Seven Years are over by which Time his Love may be supposed to abate a little if it is not founded upon Reason to re∣nounce the Bargain and be freed from the Settle∣ment upon restoring the Portion as a Youth mar∣ried under Fourteen Years old may be off if he pleases when he comes to that Age and as a Man is discharged from all Bargains but that of Mar∣riage made when he is under Twenty one  It grives me when I consider that these Re∣straints upon Matrimony take away the Advan∣tage we should otherwise have over other Coun∣tries which are sunk much by those great Checks upon Propagation the Convents It is thought chiefly owing to these that  Italy  and  Spain  want above half their Complement of People Were the Price of Wives always fixed and settled it would contribute to filling the Nation more than all the Encouragements that can possibly be given to Fo∣reigners to transplant themselves hither  I therefore as Censor of  Britain  till a Law is made will lay down Rules which shall be obser∣ved with Penalty of degrading all that break them into Pretty Fellows Smarts Squibs Hunt∣ing Horns Drums and Bagpipes  The Females that are guilty of breaking my Orders I shall respectively pronounce to be Kits Hornpipes Dulcimers and KettleDrums Such Widows as wear the Spoils of one Husband I will bury if they attempt to rob another  I ordain That no Woman ever demand one Shilling to be paid after her Husband's Death more than the very Sum she brings him or an Equivalent for it in Land  That no Settlement be made in which the Man settles on his Children more than the Reversion of the Jointure or the Value of it in Money so that at his Death he may in the Whole be bound to pay his Family but double to what he has receiv'd I would have the eldest as well as the rest have his Provision out of this  When Men are not able to come up to those Settlements I have proposed I would have them receive so much of the Portion only as they can come up to and the rest to go to the Woman by Way of PinMoney or Separate Maintenance In this I think I determined equally between the Two Sexes  If any Lawyer varies from these Rules or is above Two Days in drawing a Marriage Settle∣ment or uses more Words in it than one Skin of Parchment will contain or takes above Five Pounds for drawing it I would have him thrown over the Bar  Were these Rules observed a Woman with a small Fortune and a great deal of Worth would be sure to marry according to her Deserts if the Man's Estate were to be less incumbered in Pro∣portion as her Fortune is less than he might have with others  A Man of a great deal of Merit and not much Estate might be chosen for his Worth because it would not be difficult for him to make a Settle∣ment  The Man that loves a Woman best would not lose her for not being able to bid so much as ano∣ther or for not complying with an extravagant Demand  A fine Woman would no more be set up to Auction as she is now When a Man puts in for her her Friends or her self take Care to publish it and the Man that was the first Bidder is made no other Use of but to raise the Price He that  loves her will continue in Waiting as long as she pleases if her Fortune be thought equal to his and under Pretence of some Failure in the RentRoll or Difficulties in drawing the Settlement he is put off till a better Bargain is made with ano∣ther  All the rest of the Sex that are not rich or beau∣tiful to the highest Degree are plainly Gainers and would be married so fast that the least charm∣ing of them would soon grow Beauties to the Bat∣chelors  Widows might be easily married if they would not as they do now set up for discreet only by being mercenary  The making Matimony cheap and easy would be the greatest Discouragement to Vice The li∣miting the Expence of Children would not make Men ill inclined or afraid of having them in a regular Way and the Men of Merit would not live unmarried as they often do now because the Goodness of a Wife cannot be ensured to them out the Loss of an Estate is certain and a Man would never have the Affliction of a worthless Heir added to that of a bad Wife  I am the more serious large and particular on this Subject because my Lucubrations designed for the Encouragement of Virtue cannot have the desired Success as long as this Incumbrance of Set∣tlements continues upon Matrimony  The TATLER N  o    Materiam superabat Opus  Ovid  From  Tuesday Sept  to  Thursday Sept    From my own Apartment  September  IT is my Custom in a Dearth of News to en∣tertain my self with those Collections of Ad∣vertisements that appear at the End of all our publick Prints These I consider as Accounts of News from the little World in the same Manner that the foregoing Parts of the Paper are from the great If in one we hear that a Sovereign Prince is fled from his Capital City in the other we hear of a Tradesman who hath shut up his Shop and run away If in one we find the Victory of a General in the other we see the Desertion of a private Soldier I must confess I have a certain Weakness in my Temper that is often very much affected by these little Domestick Occurrences and have frequently been caught with Tears in my Eyes over a melancholy Advertisement  But to consider this Subject in its most ridicu∣lous Lights Advertisements are of great Use to the Vulgar First of all as they are Instruments of Ambition A Man that is by no Means big enough for the  Gazette  may easily creep into the Advertisements by which Means we often see an Apothecary in the same Paper of News with a Plenipotentiary or a RunningFootman with an Ambassador An Advertisement from  Pickadilly  goes down to Posterity with an Article from  Ma∣drid  and  John Bartlett  of  Goodman'sFields  is ce∣lebrated in the same Paper with the Emperor of  Germany  Thus the Fable tells us That the Wren mounted as high as the Eagle by getting upon his Back  A Second Use which this Sort of Writings have been turned to of late Years has been the Manage∣ment of Controversy insomuch that above half the Advertisements one meets with nowaDays are purely Polemical The Inventors of  Strops for Razors  have written against one another this Way for several Years and that with great Bitterness as the whole Argument  pro  and  con  in the Case of the  MorningGowns  is still carried on after the same Manner I need not mention the several Proprie∣tors of Dr  Anderson  's Pills nor take Notice of the many Satyrical Works of this Nature so fre∣quently published by Dr  Clark  who has had the Confidence to advertise upon that learned Knight my very worthy Friend Sir  William Read  But I shall not interpose in their Quarrel Sir  William  can give him his own in Advertisements that in the Judgment of the Impartial are as well penn'd as the Doctor's  The Third and last Use of these Writings is to inform the World where they may be furnished with almost every Thing that is necessary for Life If a Man has Pains in his Head Cholicks in his Bowels or Spots in his Clothes he may here meet with proper Cures and Remedies If a Man would recover a Wife or a Horse that is stolen or stray'd if he wants new Sermons Electuaries Asses Milk or any Thing else either for his Body or his Mind this is the Place to look for them in  The great Art in writing Advertisements is the finding out a proper Method to catch the Reader's Eye without which a good Thing may pass over unobserved or be lost among Commissions of Bankrupt Asterisks and Hands were formerly of great Use for this Purpose Of late Years the  N B  has been much in Fashion as also little Cuts and Figures the Invention of which we must a∣scribe  to the Author of SpringTrusses I must not here omit the blind  Italian  Character which be∣ing scarce legible always fixes and detains the Eye and gives the curious Reader something like the Satisfaction of prying into a Secret  But the great Skill in an Advertiser is chiefly seen in the Style which he makes use of He is to mention  the universal Esteem or general Reputa∣tion  of Things that were never heard of If he is a Physician or Astrologer he must change his Lodgings frequently and tho' he never saw any Body in them besides his own Family give pub∣lick Notice of it  For the Information of the Nobility and Gentry  Since I am thus usefully employ'd in writing Criticisms on the Works of these diminu∣tive Authors I must not pass over in Silence an Advertisement which has lately made its Appea∣rance and is written altogether in a  Ciceronian  Manner It was sent to me with Five Shillings to be inserted among my Advertisements but as it is a Pattern of good Writing in this Way I shall give it a Place in the Body of my Paper  THE highest compounded Spirit of Lavender the most glorious if the Expression may be used enlivening Scent and Flavour that can pos∣sibly be which so raptures the Spirits delights the Gust and gives such Airs to the Countenance as are not to be imagined but by those that have tried it The meanest Sort of the Thing is admi∣red by most Gentlemen and Ladies but this far more as by far it exceeds it to the gaining among all a more than common Esteem It is sold in neat Flint Bottles fit for the Pocket only at the GoldenKey in Warton'sCourt near HolbornBars for s d with Directions  At the same Time that I recommend the several Flowers in which this Spirit of Lavender is wrap∣ped up if the Expression may be used I cannot  excuse my FellowLabourers for admitting into their Papers several uncleanly Advertisements not at all proper to appear in the Works of polite Wri∣ters Among these I must reckon the  Carminitive Wind expelling  Pills If the Doctor had called them only his Carminitive Pills he had been as cleanly as one could have wished but the Second Word entirely destroys the Decency of the First There are other Absurdities of this Nature so very gross that I dare not mention them and shall therefore dismiss this Subject with a publick Ad∣monition to  Michael Parrot  That he do not pre∣sume any more to mention a certain Worm he knows of which by the Way has grown Seven Foot in my Memory for if I am not much mi∣staken it is the same that was but Nine Foot long about Six Months ago  By the Remarks I have here made it plainly ap∣pears that a Collection of Advertisements is a kind of Miscellany the Writers of which contra∣ry to all Authors except Men of Quality give Money to the Booksellers who publish their Co∣pies The Genius of the Bookseller is chiefly shown in his Method of ranging and digesting these little Tracts The last Paper I took up in my Hands places them in the following Order  The True Spanish Blacking for Shoes  c  The Beautifying Cream for the Face  c  Pease and Plaisters  c  Nectar and Ambrosia  c  Four Freehold Tenements of  l  per Annum  c  {inverted ⁂} The Present State of England  c  †{inverted †}† Annotations

Sept  to  Saturday Sept    From my own Apartment  September  THE Hours which we spend in Conversation are the most pleasing of any which we en∣joy yet methinks there is very little Care ta∣ken to improve our selves for the frequent Repe∣tition of them The common Fault in this Case is that of growing too intimate and falling into displeasing Familiarities For it is a very ordinary Thing for Men to make no other Use of a close Acquaintance with each other's Affairs but to teaze one another with unacceptable Allusions One would pass over patiently such as converse like Animals and salute each other with Bangs on the Shoulder sly Raps with Canes or other robust Pleasantries practised by the rural Gentry of this Nation But even among those who should have more polite Idea's of Things you see a Set of People who invert the Design of Conversa∣tion and make frequent Mention of ungrateful Subjects nay mention them because they are ungrateful as if the Perfection of Society were in knowing how to offend on the one Part and how to bear an Offence on the other In all Parts of this populous Town you find the merry World made up of an active and a passive Companion one who has goodnature enough to suffer all his Friend shall think fit to say and one who is re∣solved to make the most of his Goodhumour to show his Parts In the Trading Part of Mankind  I have ever observed the Jest went by the Weight of Purses and the Ridicule is made up by the Gains which arise from it Thus the Packer al∣lows the Clothier to say what he pleases and the Broker has his Countenance ready to laugh with the Merchant tho' the Abuse is to fall on him∣self because he knows that as a Gobetween he shall find his Account in being in the good Graces of a Man of Wealth Among these just and punctual People the richest Man is ever the bet∣ter Jester and they know no such Thing as a Person who shall pretend to a superior Laugh at a Man who does not make him Amends by Op∣portunities of Advantage in another Kind But among People of a different Way where the pretended Distinction in Company is only what is raised from Sense and Understanding it is very absurd to carry on a rough Raillery so far as that the whole Discourse should turn upon each others Infirmities Follies or Misfortunes  I was this Evening with a Set of Wags of this Class They appear generally by Two and Two and what is most extraordinary is that those very Persons who are most together appear least of a Mind when joined by other Company This Evil proceeds from an indiscreet Familiarity whereby a Man is allowed to say the most gra∣ting Thing imaginable to another and it shall be accounted Weakness to show an Impatience for the Unkindness But this and all other Devia∣tions from the Design of pleasing each other when we meet are derived from Interlopers in Society who want Capacity to put in a Stock among re∣gular Companions and therefore supply their Wants by stale Histories sly Observations and rude Hints which relate to the Conduct of others All Cohabitants in general run into this unhappy Fault Men and their Wives break into Re∣flections which are like so much  Arabick  to the rest of the Company Sisters and Brothers often  make the like Figure from the same unjust Sense of the Art of being intimate and familiar It is often said such an one cannot stand the Mention of such a Circumstance If he cannot I am sure it is for Want of Discourse or a worse Reason that any Companion of his touches upon it  Familiarity among the truly Wellbred never give Authority to trespass upon one another in the most minute Circumstance but it allows to be kinder than we ought otherwise presume to be  Eusebius  has Wit Humour and Spirit but there never was a Man in his Company who wished he had less for he understands Familiarity so well that he knows how to make Use of it in a Way that neither makes himself or his Friend con∣temptible but if any one is lessened by his Free∣dom it is he himself who always likes the Place the Diet and the Reception when he is in the Company of his Friends Equality is the Life of Conversation and he is as much out who assumes to himself any Part above another as he who considers himself below the rest of the Society Familiarity in Inferiors is Sauciness in Superiors Condescension neither of which are to have Being among Companions the very Word implying that they are to be equal When therefore we have abstracted the Company from all Considerations of their Quality or Fortune it will immediately appear that to make it happy and polite there must nothing be started which shall discover that our Thoughts run upon any such Distinctions Hence it will arise that Be∣nevolence must become the Rule of Society and he that is most obliging must be most diverting  This Way of Talking I am fallen into from the Reflection that I am wherever I go entertained with some Absurdity Mistake Weakness or ill Luck of some Man or other whom not only I but the Person who makes me those Relations has a Value for It would therefore be a great Be∣nefit  to the World if it could be brought to pass that no Story should be a taking one but what was to the Advantage of the Person of whom it is related By this Means he that is now a Wit in Conversation would be considered as a Sprea∣der of false News is in Business  But above all to make a Familiar fit for a Bo∣som Friend it is absolutely necessary that we should always be inclined rather to hide than rally each others Infirmities To suffer for a Fault is a Sort of Attonement and no Body is concerned for the Offence for which he has made Repara∣tion  P S  I have received the following Letter which rallies me for being witty sooner than I designed but I have now altered my Resolution and intend to be

every Thing that is monstrous in my own Times For this Reason I shall here publish to the World the Life of a Person who was neither Man nor Woman as written by one of my ingenious Correspon∣dents who seems to have imitated  Plutach  in that multifarious Erudition and those occasional Differtation which he has wrought into the Bo∣dy of his History The Life I am putting out is that of  Margery alias John Young  commonly known by the Name of Dr  Young  who as the Town very well knows was a Woman that practised Physick in Man's Clothes and after ha∣ving  had Two Wives and several Children died about a Month since  SIR  I Here make bold to trouble you with a short Account of the famous Dr  Young  's Life which you may call if you please a Second Part of the Farce of the  Sham Doctor  This perhaps will not seem so strange to you who if I am not mistaken have somewhere men∣tioned with Honour your Sister  Kirleus  as a Practitioner both in Physick and Astrology But in the common Opinion of Mankind a SheQuack is altogether as strange and astonishing a Creature as the Centaur that practis'd Physick in the Days of  Achilles  or as King  Phys  in the  Rehearsal Aesculapius  the great Founder of your Art was particularly famous for his Beard as we may conclude from the Behaviour of a Tyrant who is branded by Heathen Histo∣rians as guilty both of Sacrilege and Blasphe∣my having robbed the Statue of  Aesculapius  of a thick bushy Golden Beard and then alledged for his Excuse  That it was a Shame the Son should have a Beard when his Father  Apollo  had none  This latter Instance indeed seems some∣thing to favour a Female Professor since as I have been told the ancient Statues of  Apollo  are generally made with the Head and Face of a Woman Nay I have been credibly informed by those who have seen them both that the famous  Apollo  in the  Belvidera  did very much re∣semble Dr  Young  Let that be as it will the Doctor was a Kind of  Amazon  in Physick that made as great Devastations and Slaughters as any of our chief Heroes in the Art and was as fatal to the  English  in these our Days as the famous  Jean d' Arc  was in those of our Forefathers  I do not find any Thing remarkable in the Life I am about to write till the Year at  which Time the Doctor being about Twenty three Years old was brought to Bed of a Ba∣stard Child The Scandal of such a Misfor∣tune gave so great Uneasiness to pretty Mrs  Peg∣gy  for that was the Name by which the Doctor was then called that she left her Fami∣ly and followed her Lover to  London  with a fixed Resolution some Way or other to recover her lost Reputation But instead of changing her Life which one would have expected from so good a Disposition of Mind she took it in her Head to change her Sex This was soon done by the Help of a Sword and a Pair of Breeches I have Reason to believe that her first Design was to turn ManMidwife having her self had some Experience in those Affairs But thinking this too narrow a Foundation for her future Fortune she at length bought her a Gold Button Coat and set up for a Physician Thus we see the same fatal Miscarriage in her Youth made Mrs  Young  a Doctor that former∣ly made one of the same Sex a Pope  The Doctor succeeded very well in his Busi∣ness at first but very often met with Accidents that disquieted him As he wanted that deep magisterial Voice which gives Authority to a Prescription and is absolutely necessary for the right Pronouncing of those Words  Take these Pills  he unfortunately got the Nickname of the  Squeaking Doctor  If this Circumstance alarmed the Doctor there was another that gave him no small Disquiet and very much diminished his Gains In short he found him∣self run down as a superficial prating Quack in all Families that had at the Head of them a cautious Father or a jealous Husband These would often complain among one another that they did not like such a Smockfaced Physician though in Truth had they known how justly he deserved that Name they would rather have  favoured his Practice than have apprehended any Thing from it  Such were the Motives that determined Mrs  Young  to change her Condition and take in Marriage a virtuous young Woman who lived with her in good Reputation and made her the Father of a very pretty Girl But this Part of her Happiness was soon after destroyed by a Distemper which was too hard for our Physician and carried off his first Wife The Doctor had not been a Widow long before he married his Second Lady with whom also he lived in very good Understanding It so hap∣pened that the Doctor was with Child at the same Time that his Lady was but the little ones coming both together they passed for Twins The Doctor having entirely establish∣ed the Reputation of his Manhood especially by the Birth of the Boy of whom he had been lately delivered and who very much resembles him grew into good Business and was particu∣larly famous for the Cure of Venereal Distem∣pers but would have had much more Practice among his own Sex had not some of them been so unreasonable as to demand certain Proofs of their Cure which the Doctor was not able to give them The florid blooming Look which gave the Doctor some Uneasiness at first in∣stead of betraying his Person only recommend∣ed his Physick Upon this Occasion I cannot forbear mentioning what I thought a very a∣greeable Surprize in one of  Moliere  's Plays where a young Woman applies her self to a sick Person in the Habit of a Quack and speaks to her Patient who was something scandalized at the Youth of his Physician to the following Purpose  I begun to practise in the Reign of  Francis I  and am now in the Hundred and fifti∣eth Year of my Age but by the Vertue of my Medicaments have maintained my self in the  same Beauty and Freshness I had at Fifteen  For this Reason  Hippocrates  lays it down as a Rule That a Student in Physick should have a sound Constitution and a healthy Look which in∣deed seem as necessary Qualifications for a Physician as a good Life and virtuous Beha∣viour for a Divine But to return to our Sub∣ject About Two Years ago the Doctor was very much afflicted with the Vapours which grew upon him to such a Degree that about six Weeks since they made an End of him His Death discovered the Disguise he had acted un∣der and brought him back again to his former Sex 'Tis said that at his Burial the Pall was held up by Six Women of some Fashion The Doctor left behind him a Widow and Two Fa∣therless Children if they may be called so be∣sides the little Boy beforementioned In rela∣tion to whom we may say of the Doctor as the good old Ballad about  The Children in the Wood  says of the Unnatural Unkle that he was Father and Mother both in one These are all the Circumstances that I could learn of Doctor  Young  's Life which might have given Occasion to many obscene Fictions But as I know those would never have gained a Place in your Paper I have not troubled you with any Impertinence of that Nature having stuck to the Truth ve∣ry scrupulously as I always do when I sub∣scribe my self  SIR  Your  c  I shall add as a Postcript to this Letter that I am informed the famous  Saltero  who sells Cof∣fee in his Musaeum at  Chelsea  has by him a Cu∣riosity which helped the Doctor to carry on his Imposture and will give great Satisfaction to the curious

allay the Passions of the Mind or turn them to a vigorous Prosecution of what is dictated by the Understanding In order to this good End I would keep a watchful Eye upon the growing Inclinations of Youth and be parti∣cularly careful to prevent their indulging them∣selves in such Sentiments as may imbitter their more advanced Age I have now under Cure a young Gentleman who lately communicated to me that he was of all Men living the most mise∣rably envious I desired the Circumstances of his Distemper upon which with a Sigh that would have moved the most inhumane Breast  'Mr  Bickerstaff  said he I am Nephew to a Gen∣tleman of a very great Estate to whose Favour I have a Cousin that has equal Pretensions with my self This Kinsman of mine is a young Man of the highest Merit imaginable and has a Mind so tender and so generous that I can observe he returns my Envy with Pity He makes me upon all Occasions the most obliging Condescensions And I cannot but take Notice of the Concern he is in to see my Life blasted with this racking Passion though it is against himself In the Presence of my Unkle when I am in the Room he never speaks so well as he is capable of but always lowers his Talents and Accomplishments out of Regard to me  What I beg of you dear Sir is to instruct me how to love him as I know he does me And I beseech you if possible to set my Heart right that it may no longer be tormented where it should be pleased or hate a Man whom I can∣not but approve  The Patient gave me this Account with such Candour and Openness that I conceived imme∣  iate Hopes of his Cure because in Diseases of  he Mind the Person affected is half recovered  hen he is sensible of his Distemper Sir said I  he Acknowledgment of your Kinsman's Merit is  very hopeful Symptom for it is the Nature of  ersons afflicted with this Evil when they are in∣  urable to pretend a Contempt of the Person  nvied if they are taxed with that Weakness A  an who is really envious will not allow he is  o but upon such an Accusation is tormented  ith the Reflection that to envy a Man is to al∣  ow him your Superior But in your Case when  ou examine the Bottom of your Heart I am apt  o think it is Avarice which you mistake for En∣  y Were it not that you have both Expectations  rom the same Man you would look upon your  ousin's Accomplishments with Pleasure You  hat now consider him as an Obstacle to your  nterest would then behold him as an Ornament  o your Family I observed my Patient upon this  ccasion recover himself in some Measure and  e owned to me that he hoped it was as I ima∣  ined for that in all Places but where he was his  ival he had Pleasure in his Company This  as the first Discourse we had upon this Malady  nd I do not doubt but after Two or Three  ore I shall by just Degrees soften his Envy into  mulation  Such an Envy as I have here described may  ossibly creep into an ingenuous Mind but the  nvy which makes a Man uneasy to himself and  hers is a certain Distortion and Perverseness of  Temper that renders him unwilling to be pleas'd with any Thing without him that has either Beau∣ty or Perfection in it I look upon it as a Distem∣per in the Mind which I know no Moralist that has described in this Light when a Man cannot discern any Thing which another is Master of that is agreeable For which Reason I look up∣on the goodnatured Man to be endowed with a certain discerning Faculty which the Envious are altogether deprived of Shallow Wits superficial Criticks and conceited Fops are with me so ma∣ny blind Men in respect of Excellencies They can behold nothing but Faults and Blemishes and indeed see nothing that is worth seeing Show them a Poem it is Stuff a Picture it is Daubing They find nothing in Architecture that is not ir∣regular or in Musick that is not out of Tune These Men should consider that it is their Envy which deforms every Thing and that the Ugli∣ness is not in the Object but in the Eye And as for nobler Minds whose Merits are either not discovered or are misrepresented by the envious Part of Mankind they should rather consider their Defamers with Pity than Indignation A Man cannot have an Idea of Perfection in ano∣ther which he was never sensible of in himself Mr  Lock  tells us That upon asking a blind Man What he thought Scarlet was He answered That he believed it was like the Sound of a Trumpet He was forced to form his Conceptions of Idea's which he had not by those which he had In the same Manner ask an envious Man What he thinks of Virtue He will call it Design What of Good∣nature And he will term it Dulness The Diffe∣rence is That as the Person beforementioned was born blind your envious Men have con∣tracted the Distemper themselves and are trou∣bled with a Sort of an acquired Blindness Thus the Devil in  Milton  tho' made an Angel of Light could see nothing to please him even in Para∣dise  and hated our First Parents though in their State of Innocence  The TATLER N  o    Veniet Manus Auxilio

you so I know not why a Man so famed for Astrological Observations may not be also a good Casuist upon which Presumption 'tis I ask your Advice in an Affair that at present puzzles quite that slender Stock of Divinity I am Master of I have now been some Time in Holy Orders and Fellow of a certain College  in one of the Universities but weary of that unactive Life I resolve to be doing Good in my Generation A worthy Gentleman has lately offer'd me a fat Rectory but means I perceive his Kinswoman should have the Benefit of the Clergy I am a Novice in the World and con∣fess it startles me how the Body of Mrs  Abi∣gail  can be annexed to Cure of Souls Sir would you give us in one of your  Tatlers  the Original and Progress of SmockSimony and shew us that where the Laws are silent Men's Consciences ought to be so too you could not more oblige our Fraternity of young Divines and among the rest  Your humble Servant  HighChurch  I am very proud of having a Gentleman of this Name for my Admirer and may some Time or other write such a Treatise as he mentions In the mean Time I do not see why our Clergy who are very frequently Men of good Families should be reproached if any of them chance to espouse a HandMaid with a Rectory in  Commen∣dam  since the best of our Peers have often join∣ed themselves to the Daughters of very ordinary Tradesmen upon the same valuable Considera∣tions  Globe in Moorfields  Sept  Honoured Son  I Have now finished my Almanack for the next Year in all the Parts of it except that which concerns the Weather and you having shewn your self by some of your late Works more Weatherwise than any of our modern Astrologers I most humbly presume to trouble you upon this Head You know very well that in our ordinary Almanacks the Wind and Rain Snow and Hail Clouds and Sunshine have their proper Seasons and come up as regularly  in their several Months as the Fruits and Plants of the Earth As for my own Part I freely own to you that I generally steal my Weather out of some antiquated Almanack that foretold it several Years ago Now Sir what I hum∣bly beg of you is that you would lend me your State WeatherGlass in order to fill up this vacant Column in my Works This I know would sell my Almanack beyond any other and make me a richer Man than  Poor Robin  If you will not grant me this Favour I must have Recourse to my old Method and will copy after an Almanack which I have by me and which I think was made for the Year when the great Storm was I am  SIR  The most humble of Your Admirers  T Philomath  This Gentleman does not consider what a strange Appearance his Almanack would make to the Ignorant should he transpose his Weather as he must do did he follow the Dictates of my Glass What would the World say to see Sum∣mers filled with Clouds and Storms and Winters with Calms and Sunshine according to the Va∣riations of the Weather as they might acciden∣tally appear in a State Barometer But let that be as it will I shall apply my own Invention to my own Use and if I do not make my Fortune by it it will be my own Fault  The next Letter comes to me from another Selfinteressed Solicitor  Mr  Bickerstaff  I Am going to set up for a Scrivener and have thought of a Project which may turn both to your Account and mine It came into my  Head upon reading that learned and useful Pa∣per of yours concerning Advertisements You must understand I have made my self Master in the whole Art of Advertising both as to the Style and the Letter Now if you and I could so manage it that no Body should write Adver∣tisements besides my self or print them any where but in your Paper we might both of us get Estates in a little Time For this End I would likewise propose that you should enlarge the Design of Advertisements and have sent you Two or Three Samples of my Work in this Kind which I have made for particular Friends and intend to open Shop with The First is for a Gentleman who would willingly marry if he could find a Wife to his Liking the Second is for a poor Whig who is lately turned out of his Post and the Third for a Person of a contrary Party who is willing to get into one  WHereas  A B  next Door to the  Pestle and Mortar  being about Years old of a spare Make with darkcoloured Hair bright Eye and a long Nose has Occasion for a goodhu∣mour'd tall fair young Woman of about  l  Fortune These are to give Notice That if any such young Woman has a Mind to dispose of her self in Marriage to such a Person as the above∣mentioned she may be provided with a Husband a Coach and Horses and a proportionable Settle∣ment  C D  designing to quit his Place has great Quantities of Paper Parchment Ink Wax and Wafers to dispose of which will be sold at very reasonable Rates  E F  a Person of good Behaviour Six

Saturday Sept  to  Tuesday Sept    From my own Apartment  Sept  THE whole Creation preys upon it self E∣very living Creature is inhabited A Flea has a Thousand invisible Insects that teaze him as he jumps from Place to Place and revenge our Quarrels upon him A very ordinary Microscope shows us that a Louse is it self a very lousy Creature A Whale besides those Seas and O∣ceans in the several Vessels of his Body which are filled with innumerable Shoals of little Ani∣mals carries about it a whole World of Inhabi∣tants insomuch that if we believe the Calcula∣tions some have made there are more living Creatures which are too small for the naked Eye to behold about the Leviathan than there are of visible Creatures upon the Face of the whole Earth Thus every nobler Creature is as it were the Basis and Support of Multitudes that are his Inferiors  This Consideration very much comforts me when I think on those numberless Vermin that feed upon this Paper and find their Sustenance out of it I mean the small Wits and Scribble  that every Day turn a Penny by nibbling at  Lucubrations This has been so advantageou  this little Species of Writers that if they  me Justice I may expect to have my Statue  in  Grubstreet  as being a common Benefactor to that Quarter  They say when a Fox is very much troubled with Fleas he goes into the next Pool with a lit∣tle Lock of Wool in his Mouth and keeps his Body under Water till the Vermin get into it after which he quits the Wool and diving leaves his Tormentors to shift for themselves and get their Livelihood where they can I would have these Gentlemen take Care that I do not serve them after the same Manner for though I have hitherto kept my Temper pretty well it is not impossible but I may some Time or other disap∣pear and what will then become of them Should I lay down my Paper What a Famine would there be among the Hawkers Printers Booksellers and Authors It would be like Dr  Bs  's dropping his Cloak with the whole Congregation hanging upon the Skirts of it To enumerate some of these my doughty Antago∣nists I was threatened to be answered Weekly  Tit  for  Tat  I was undermined by the  Whisperer  haunted by  Tom Brown  's  Ghost  scolded at by a  Female Tatler  and slandered by another of the same Character under the Title of  Atalantis  I have been  annotated retattled examined  and  condoled  But it being my standing Maxim never to speak ill of the Dead I shall let these Authors rest in Peace and take great Pleasure in thinking that I have sometimes been the Means of their getting a Belly full When I see my self thus surrounded by such formidable Enemies I often think of the Knight of the  Red Cross  in  Spencer  's  of Error  who after he has cut off the Dra∣  's Head and left it wallowing in a Flood of  sees a Thousand monstrous Reptiles making  Attempts upon him one with many Heads  with none and all of them without  The same so sore annoyed has the Knight  That well nigh choaked with the deadly Stink  His Forces fail ne can no longer fight  Whose Courage when the Fiend perceived to shrink  She poured forth out of her Hellish Sink  Her fruitful cursed Spawn of Serpents small  Deformed Monsters foul and black as Ink  Which swarming all about his Legs did crawl  And him encombred sore but could not hurt at all  As gentle Shepherd in sweet Eventide  When ruddy  Phoebus  gins to welk in West  High on an Hill his Flock to viewen wide  Marks which do bite their hasty Supper best  A Cloud of combrous Gnats do him molest  All striving to infix their feeble Stings  That from their Noyance he no where can rest  But with his clownish Hands their tender Wings  He brusheth oft and oft doth mar their Murmur∣ings  If ever I should want such a Fry of little Au∣thors to attend me I shall think my Paper in a very decaying Condition They are like Ivy a∣bout an Oak which adorns the Tree at the same Time that it eats into it or like a great Man's Equipage that do Honour to the Person on whom they feed For my Part when I see my self thus attacked I do not consider my Antago∣nists as malicious but hungry and therefore am resolved never to take any Notice of them  As for those who detract from my Labours without being prompted to it by an empty Sto∣mach in Return to their Censures I shall take Pains to excel and never fail to perswade my self that their Enmity is nothing but their E  or Ignorance  Give me Leave to conclude like an old  and a Moralist with a Fable  The Owls Bats and several other B  Night were one Day got together in  Shade where they abused their Neighbours in a very sociable Manner Their Satyr at last fell upon the Sun whom they all agreed to be very troublesome impertinent and inquisitive Upon which the Sun who overheard them spoke to them after this Manner Gentlemen I wonder how you dare abuse one that you know could in an Instant scorch you up and burn every Mother's Son of you But the only Answer I shall give you or the Revenge I shall take of you is to  shine on  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesd Sept  to  Thursd Sept    From my own Apartment  Sept  THE following Letter has laid before me ma∣ny great and manifest Evils in the World of Letters which I had overlooked but they open to me a very busy Scene and it will require no small Care and Application to amend Errors which are become so universal The Affectation of Politeness is exposed in this Epistle with a great deal of Wit and Discernment so that whatever Discourses I may fall into hereafter up∣on the Subjects the Writer treats of I shall at present lay the Matter before the World without the least Alteration from the Words of my Cor∣respondent  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  IR  ere are some Abuses among us of great Con∣  quence the Reformation of which is pro∣  our Province though as far as I have been  ant in your Papers you have not yet con∣sidered  them These are the deplorable Igno∣rance that for some Years hath reigned among our  English  Writers the great Depravity of our Tast and the continual Corruption of our Style I say nothing here of those who handle particu∣lar Sciences Divinity Law Physick and the like I mean the Traders in History and Poli∣ticks and the  Belles Lettres  together with those by whom Books are not Translated but as the common Expressions are  Done out of French La∣tin  or other Language and  Made English  I can∣not but observe to you that till of late Years a  Grubstreet  Book was always bound in Sheepskin with suitable Print and Paper the Price never a∣bove a Shilling and taken off wholly by com∣mon Tradesmen or Country Pedlars but now they appear in all Sizes and Shapes and in all Places They are handed about from Lapfulls in every Coffeehouse to Persons of Quality are shewn in  WestminsterHall  and the Court of Re∣quests You may see them gilt and in Royal Paper of Five or Six Hundred Pages and rated accordingly I would engage to furnish you with a Catalogue of  English  Books published within the Compass of Seven Years past which at the first Hand would cost you a Hundred Pounds wherein you shall not be able to find Ten Lines together of common Grammar or common Sense  These Two Evils Ignorance and Want of Tast have produced a Third I mean the continual Corruption of our  English  Tongue which with∣out some timely Remedy will suffer more by th  false Refinements of Twenty Years past tha  hath been improved in the foregoing Hu  And this is what I design chiefly to  upon leaving the former Evils to your A  ¦version  But instead of giving you a List of  Refinements crept into our Language  send you the Copy of a Letter I recei  Time ago from a most accomplished Person in this Way of Writing upon which I shall make some Remarks It is in these Terms  SIR  I  Cou'd n't  get the Things you sent for all  a∣bout Town  I  thôt  to  ha'  come down my self and then  I'd h' bôt 'um  but I  ha'n't don't  and I believe I  can't d't  that's  PozzTom  begins to  gi'mself  Airs because  he's  going with the  Plenipo's  'Tis said the  French  King will  bamboozl' us agen  which  causes many Spe∣culations  The  Jacks  and others of that  Kidney  are very uppish and  alert upon't  as you may see by their  Phizz'sWill Hazzard  has got the  Hipps  having lost  to the Tune of  Five Hundr'd Pound  thô  he understands Play very well  no body better  He has promis't me upon  Rep  to leave off Play but you know 'tis a Weakness  he's  too apt to  give into thô  he has as much Wit as any Man  no body more  He has lain  incog  ever sinceThe  Mob's  very quiet with us nowI believe you  thôt  I  banter'd  you in my last like a  Country Put  I  sha'n't  leave Town this Month  c  This Letter is in every Point an admirable Pat∣tern of the present polite Way of Writing nor is it of less Authority for being an Epistle You may gather every Flower in it with a Thousand more of equal Sweetness from the Books Pam∣  lets and single Papers offered us every Day in  Coffeehouses And these are the Beauties in∣  ced to supply the Want of Wit Sense Hu∣  and Learning which formerly were look∣  n as Qualifications for a Writer If a  Wit who died Forty Years ago were  om the Grave on Purpose How would  le to read this Letter And after he had  ugh that Difficulty how would he be  able to understand it The first Thing that strikes your Eye is the  Breaks  at the End of almost every Sentence of which I know not the Use only that it is a Refinement and very frequently practised Then you will observe the Abbrevia∣tions and Elisions by which Consonants of most obdurate Sound are joined together without one softening Vowel to intervene and all this only to make one Syllable of Two directly contrary to the Example of the  Greeks  and  Romans  alto∣gether of the  Gothick  Strain and a natural Ten∣dency towards relapsing into Barbarity which delights in Monosyllables and uniting of Mute Consonants as it is observable in all the Nor∣thern Languages And this is still more visible in the next Refinement which consists in pro∣nouncing the first Syllable in a Word that has many and dismissing the rest such as  Phizz Hipps Mobb Pozz Rep  and many more when we are already overloaded with Monosyllables which are the Disgrace of our Language Thus we cram one Syllable and cut off the rest as the Owl fattened her Mice after she had bit off their Legs to prevent them from running away and if ours be the same Reason for maiming our Words it will certainly answer the End for I am sure no other Nation will desire to borrow them Some Words are hitherto but fairly split and therefore only in their Way to Perfection as  Incog  and  Plenipo  But in a short Time 'tis to be hoped they will be further dock'd to  Inc  and  Plen  This Reflection has made me of late Years very impatient for a Peace which I believe would save the Lives of many brave Words as well as Men The War has introduced abun∣dance of Polysyllables which will never be able to live many more Campaigns  Speculations Operations Preliminaries Ambassadors Pallisa∣does Communication Circumvallation Battalions  as numerous as they are if they attack us too  frequently in our Coffeehouses we shall certain∣ly put them to Flight and cut off the Rear  The Third Refinement observable in the Letter I send you consists in the Choice of certain Words invented by some  pretty Fellows  such as  Banter Bamboozle Country Put  and  Kidney  as it is there applied some of which are now strug∣gling for the Vogue and others are in Possession of it I have done my utmost for some Years past to stop the Progress of  Mobb  and  Banter  but have been plainly born down by Numbers and betrayed by those who promised to assist me  In the last Place you are to take Notice of cer∣tain choice Phrases scattered through the Letter some of them tolerable enough till they were worn to Rags by servile Imitators You might easily find them though they were not in a dif∣ferent Print and therefore I need not disturb them  These are the false Refinements in our Style which you ought to correct First by Argument and fair Means but if those fail I think you are to make Use of your Authority as Censor and by an Annual  Index Expurgatorius  expunge all Words and Phrases that are offensive to good Sense and condemn those barbarous Mutilations of Vowels and Syllables In this last Point the usual Pretence is That they spell as they speak A noble Standard for Language To depend up∣on the Caprice of every Coxcomb who because Words are the Cloathing of our Thoughts cuts them out and shapes them as he pleases and changes them oftner than his Dress I believe all reasonable People would be content that such Refiners were more sparing in their Words and liberal in their Syllables And upon this Head I should be glad you would bestow some Advice upon several young Readers in our Churches who coming up from the University full fraight  with Admiration of our Town Politeness will needs correct the Style of their PrayerBooks In reading the Absolution they are very careful to say  Pardons  and  Absolves  and in the Prayer for the Royal Family it must be  endue'um enrich'um prosper'um  and  bring'um  Then in their Ser∣mons they use all the modern Terms of Art  Sham Banter Mob Bubble Bully Cutting Shuf∣fling  and  Palming  all which and many more of the like Stamp as I have heard them often in the Pulpit from such young Sophisters so I have read them in some of  those Sermons that have made most Noise of late  The Design it seems is to avoid the dreadful Imputation of Pedantry to shew us that they know the Town understand Men and Manners and have not been poring upon old unfashionable Books in the Uni∣versity  I should be glad to see you the Instrument of introducing into our Style that Simplicity which is the best and truest Ornament of most Things in Life which the politer Ages always aimed at in their Building and Dress  Simplex Munditiis  as well as their Productions of Wit 'Tis mani∣fest that all new affected Modes of Speech whe∣ther borrowed from the Court the Town or the Theatre are the first perishing Parts in any Language and as I could prove by many Hun∣dred Instances have been so in ours The Wri∣tings of  Hooker  who was a Country Clergyman and of  Parsons  the Jesuit both in the Reign of Queen  Elizabeth  are in a Style that with very few Allowances would not offend any present Reader much more clear and intelligible than those of Sir  H Wootton  Sir  Rob Naunton Osborn Daniel  the Historian and several others who writ later but being Men of the Court and af∣fecting the Phrases then in Fashion they are of∣ten either not to be understood or appear perfect∣ly ridiculous  What Remedies are to be applied to these Evils I have not Room to consider having I fear already taken up most of your Paper Be∣sides I think it is our Office only to represent A∣buses and yours to redress them I am with great Respect  SIR  Your  c  The TATLER N  o    Principiis obsta  From  Thursd Sept  to  Saturd Sept    From my own Apartment  Sept  THere are very many ill Habits that might with much Ease have been prevented which after we have indulged our selves in them be∣come incorrigible We have a sort of Proverbial Expression of  taking a Woman down in her Wed∣ding Shoes  if you would bring her to Reason An early Behaviour of this Sort had a very re∣markable good Effect in a Family wherein I was several Years an intimate Acquaintance  A Gentleman in  Lincolushire  had Four Daugh∣ters Three of which were early married very happily but the Fourth though no Way inferior to any of her Sisters either in Person or Accom∣plishments had from her Infancy discovered so imperious a Temper usually called a High Spi∣rit that it continually made great Uneasiness in the Family became her known Character in the Neighbourhood and deterred all her Lovers from declaring themselves However in Process of Time a Gentleman of a plentiful Fortune and  long Acquaintance having observed that Quick∣ness of Spirit to be her only Fault made his Ad∣dresses and obtained her Consent in due Form The Lawyers finished the Writings in which by the Way there was no PinMoney and they were married After a decent Time spent in the Father's House the Bridegroom went to prepare his Seat for her Reception During the whole Course of his Courtship though a Man of the most equal Temper he had artificially lamented to her that he was the most passionate Creature breathing By this one Intimation he at once made her understand Warmth of Temper to be what he ought to pardon in her as well as that he alarmed her against that Constitution in him∣self She at the same Time thought her self high∣ly obliged by the composed Behaviour which he maintained in her Presence Thus far he with great Success soothed her from being guilty of Violences and still resolved to give her such a terrible Apprehension of his fiery Spirit that she should never dream of giving Way to her own He returned on the Day appointed for carrying her Home but instead of a Coach and Six Horses together with the gay Equipage suitable to the Occasion he appeared without a Servant mounted on the Skeleton of a Horse which his Huntsman had the Day before brought in to feast his Dogs on the Arrival of their new Mistress with a Pillion fixed behind and a Case of Pi∣stols before him attended only by a Favourite Hound Thus equipped he in a very obliging but somewhat positive Manner desired his La∣dy to seat her self on the Cushion which done away they crawled The Road being obstruct∣ed by a Gate the Dog was commanded to open it The poor Cur looked up and wagged his Tail but the Master to shew the Impa∣tience of his Temper drew a Pistol and shot him dead He had no sooner done it but he  fell into a Thousand Apologies for his unhappy Rashness and begged as many Pardons for his Excesses before one for whom he had so profound a Respect Soon after their Steed stum∣bled but with some Difficulty recovered How∣ever the Bridegroom took Occasion to swear if he frighted his Wife so again he would run him through And alas the poor Animal being now almost tired made a second Trip imme∣diately on which the careful Husband alights and with great Ceremony first takes off his La∣dy then the Accoutrements draws his Sword and saves the Huntsman the Trouble of killing him Then says to his Wife Child prithee take up the Saddle which she readily did and tug∣ged it Home where they found all Things in the greatest Order suitable to their Fortune and the present Occasion Some Time after the Fa∣ther of the Lady gave an Entertainment to all his Daughters and their Husbands where when the Wives were retired and the Gentleman pas∣sing a Toast about our last married Man took Occasion to observe to the rest of his Brethren how much to his great Satisfaction he found the World mistaken as to the Temper of his Lady for that she was the most meek and hum∣ble Woman breathing The Applause was re∣ceived with a loud Laugh But as a Tryal which of them would appear the most Master at Home he proposed they should all by Turns send for their Wives down to them A Servant was dis∣patched and Answer was made by one Tell him I will come by and by another That she would come when the Cards were out of her Hand and so on But no sooner was her Hus∣band's Desire whispered in the Ear of our last married Lady but the Cards were clapped on the Table and down she comes with My Dear would you speak with me He receives her in his Arms and after repeated Caresses tells her  the Experiment confesses his good Nature and assures her That since she could now command her Temper he would no longer disguise his own  I received the following Letter with a Dozen of Wine and cannot but do Justice to the Li∣quor and give my Testimony That I have tried it upon several of my Acquaintance who were given to impertinent Abbreviations with great Success  Mr  Bickerstaff  I Send you by this Bearer and not  per  Bearer a Dozen of that Claret which is to be sold at  Gar∣raway  's Coffeehouse on  Thursday  the Fifth of  Octo∣ber  next I can assure you I have found by Ex∣perience the Efficacy of ic in amending a Fault you complain of in your last The very first Draught of it has some Effect upon the Speech of the Drinker and restores all the Letters taken away by the Elisions so justly complained of  Will Hazzard  was cured of his  Hypochondria  by Three Glasses and the Gentleman who gave you an Account of his late Indisposition has in publick Company after the First Quart spoke every Syllable of the Word Plenipotentiary  Your  c  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturd Sept  to  Tuesd Octob    From my own Apartment  Octob  I Have received the following Letter from my unfortunate old Acquaintance the Uphol∣sterer who I observed had long absented him∣self  from the Bench at the upper End of the  Mall  Having not seen him for some Time I was in Fear I should soon hear of his Death especially since he never appeared though the Noons have been of late pretty warm and the Councils at that Place very full from the Hour of Twelve to Three which the Sages of that Board employ in Conference while the unthinking Part of Man∣kind are eating and drinking for the Support of their own private Persons without any Regard to the Publick  SIR  I Should have waited on you very frequently to have discoursed you upon some Matters of Moment but that I love to be well informed in the Subject upon which I consult my Friends be∣fore I enter into Debate with them I have there∣fore with the utmost Care and Pains applied my self to the reading all the Writings and Pam∣phlets which have come out since the Trial and have studied Night and Day in order to be Ma∣ster of the whole Controversy But the Authors are so numerous and the State of Affairs alters so very fast that I am now a Fortnight behind∣hand in my Reading and know only how Things stood Twelve Days ago I wish you would enter into those useful Subjects for if I may be allowed to say so these are not Times to jest in As for my own Part you know very well that I am of a publick Spirit and never regarded my own Interest but looked further and let me tell you that while some People are minding only themselves and Families and o∣thers are thinking only of their own Country Thing go on strangely in the  North  I foresee very great Evils arising from the Neglect of Transactions at a Distance for which Reason I am now writing a Letter to a Friend in the Country which I design as an Answer to the  Czar of  Muscovy  's Letter to the Grand Signior concerning his Majesty of  Sweden  I have en∣deavoured to prove that it is not reasonable to expect that his  Swedish  Majesty should leave  Bender  without Forty Thousand Men and I have added to this an Apology for the  Cossacks  But the Matter multiplies upon me and I grow dim with much Writing therefore desire if you have an old green Pair of Spectacles such as you used about your Fiftieth Year that you send them to me as also that you would please to desire Mr  Morphew  to send me in a Bushel of Coals on the Credit of my Answer to his Cza∣rian Majesty for I design it shall be printed for  Morphew  and the Weather grows sharp I shall take it kindly if you would order him also to send me the Papers as they come out If there are no fresh Pamphlets published I compute that I shall know before the End of next Month what has been done in Town to this Day If it were not for an ill Custom lately introduced by a certain Author of talking  Latin  at the Begin∣ning of Papers Matters would be in a much clearer Light than they are But to our Com∣fort there are solid Writers who are not guilty of this Pedantry The  PostMan  writes like an Angel The  Moderator  is fine Reading It would do you no Harm to read the  PostBoy  with Attention he is very deep of late He is In∣structive but I confess a little Satyrical A sharp Pen He cares not what he says The  Exa∣miner  is admirable and is become a grave and substantial Author But above all I am at a Loss how to govern my self in my Judgment of those whose whole Writings consist in Interro∣gatories And then the Way of answering by proposing Questions as hard to them is quite as extraordinary As for my Part I tremble at these Novelties we expose in my Opinion our Af∣fairs too much by it You may be sure the  French  King will spare no Cost to come at the reading of them I dread to think if the Fable of the  Black Birds  should fall into his Hands But I shall not venture to say more till I see you In the mean Time  I am  c  P S  I take the  Bender  Letter in the  Exami∣ner  to be spurious  This unhappy Correspondent whose fantastical Loyalty to the King of  Sweden  has reduced him to this low Condition of Reason and Fortune would appear much more monstrous in his Mad∣ness did we not see Crowds very little above his Circumstances from the same Cause a Passion to Politicks  It is no unpleasant Entertainment to consider the Commerce even of the Sexes interrupted by Difference in State Affairs A Wench and her Gallant parted last Week upon the Words  Unli∣mited  and  Passive  And there is such a Jargon of Terms got into the Mouths of the very silliest of the Women that you cannot come into a Room even among them but you find them divided in∣to  Whig  and  Tory  What heightens the Humour is that all the hard Words they know they cer∣tainly suppose to be Terms useful in the Disputes of the Parties I came in this Day where Two were in very hot Debate and one of them pro∣posed to me to explain to them what was the Dif∣ference between Circumcision and Predestination You may be sure I was at a Loss but they were too angry at each other to wait for my Explana∣tion but proceeded to lay open the whole State of Affairs instead of the usual Topicks of Dress Gallantry and Scandal  I have often wondered how it should be possible that this Turn to Politicks should so universally prevail to the Exclusion of every other Subject out  of Conversation and upon mature Consideration find it is for Want of Discourse Look round you among all the young Fellows you meet and you see those who have least Relish for Books Com∣pany or Pleasure though they have no Manner of Qualities to make them succeed in those Pur∣suits shall make very passable Politicians Thus the most barren Invention shall find enough to say to make one appear an able Man in the TopCof∣feehouses It is but adding a certain Vehemence in uttering your self let the Thing you say be never so flat and you shall be thought a very sensible Man if you were not too hot As Love and Honour are the noblest Motives of Life so the Pretenders to them without being animated by them are the most contemptible of all Sorts of Pretenders The unjust Affectation of any Thing that is laudable is ignominious in Proportion to the Worth of the Thing we affect Thus as Love of one's Country is the most glorious of all Passions to see the most ordinary Tools in a Na∣tion give themselves Airs that Way without any one good Quality in their own Life has something in it Romantick yet not so ridiculous as odious  ADVERTISEMENT  Mr  Bickerstaff  has received  Silvia  's Letter from the  Bath  and his Sister is set out thither  Tom Frontley  who is one of the  Guides  for the Town is desired to bring her into Company and oblige her with a Mention in his next Lampoon  The TATLER N  o    Sunt certa Piacula quae te  Ter pure Lecto poterunt recreare Libello  Hor  From  Tuesd Octob  to  Thursd Octob    From my own Apartment  Octob  WHEN the Mind has been perplexed with anxious Cares and Passions the best Me∣thod of bringing it to its usual State of Tranqui∣lity is as much as we possibly can to turn our Thoughts to the Adversities of Persons of higher Consideration in Virtue and Merit than our selves By this Means all the little Incidents of our own Lives if they are unfortunate seem to be the Ef∣fect of Justice upon our Faults and Indiscretions When those whom we know to be excellent and deserving of a better Fate are wretched we cannot but resign our selves whom most of us know to merit a much worse State than that we are placed in For such and many other Occasions there is one admirable Relation which one might re∣commend for certain Periods of one's Life to touch comfort and improve the Heart of Man  Tully  says somewhere The Pleasures of an Hus∣bandman are next to those of a Philosopher In like Manner one may say for methinks they bear the same Proportion one to another the Pleasures of Humanity are next to those of Devotion In both these latter Satisfactions there is a certain Humiliation which exalts the Soul above its ordi∣nary State At the same Time that it lessens our Value of our selves it enlarges our Estimation of others The History I am going to speak of is  that of  Joseph  in Holy Writ which is related with such Majestick Simplicity that all the Parts of it strike us with strong Touches of Nature and Compassion and he must be a Stranger to both who can read it with Attention and not be over∣whelmed with the Vicissitudes of Joy and Sor∣row I hope it will not be a Prophanation to tell it ones own Way here that they who may be unthinking enough to be more frequently Readers of such Papers as this than of Sacred Writ may be advertised that the greatest Pleasures the Ima∣gination can be entertained with are to be found there and that even the Style of the Scriptures is more than Humane  Joseph  a beloved Child of  Israel  became invi∣dious to his elder Brethren for no other Reason but his superior Beauty and Excellence of Body and Mind insomuch that they could not bear his growing Virtue and let him live They there∣fore conspire his Death but Nature pleaded so strongly for him in the Heart of one of them that by his Perswasion they determined rather to bury him in a Pit than be his immediate Execu∣tioners with their own Hands When thus much was obtained for him their Minds still softened towards him and they took the Opportunity of some Passengers to sell him into  Egypt Israel  was persuaded by the Artifice of his Sons that the Youth was torn to Pieces by Wild Beasts But  Joseph  was sold to Slavery and still exposed to new Misfortunes from the same Cause as before his Beauty and his Virtue By a false Accusation he was committed to Prison but in Process of Time delivered from it in Consideration of his Wis∣dom and Knowledge and made the Governor of  Pharaoh  's House In this Elevation of his For∣tune his Brothers were sent into  Egypt  to buy Ne∣cessaries of Life in a Famine As soon as they are brought into his Presence he beholds but he beholds with Compassion the Men who had sold  him to Slavery approaching him with Awe and Reverence While he was looking over his Bre∣thren he takes a Resolution to indulge himself in the Pleasure of stirring their and his own Af∣fections by keeping himself concealed and exa∣mining into the Circumstances of their Family For this End with an Air of Severity as a watch∣ful Minister to  Pharaoh  he accuses them as Spies who are come into  Egypt  with Designs against the State This led them into the Account which he wanted of them the Condition of their ancient Father and little Brother whom they had left be∣hind them When he had learned that his Bro∣ther was living he demands the bringing him to  Egypt  as a Proof of their Veracity  But it would be a vain and empty Endeavour to attempt laying this excellent Representation of the Passions of Man in the same Colours as they appear in the Sacred Writ in any other Manner or almost any other Words than those made use of in the Page it self I am obliged therefore to turn my designed Narration rather into a Com∣ment upon the several Parts of that beautiful and passionate Scene When  Joseph  expects to see  Benjamin  How natural and how forcible is the Reflection  This Affliction is come upon us in that we saw the Anguish of our Brother's Soul  without Pity How moving must it be to  Joseph  to hear  Reuben  accuse the rest that they would not hear what he pleaded in Behalf of his Innocence and Distress He turns from them and weeps but commands his Passion so far as to give Orders for binding one of them in the Presence of the rest while he at Leisure observed their different Sentiments and Concern in their Gesture and Countenance When  Benjamin  is demanded in Bondage for stealing the Cup With what Force and what Resignation does  Judah  address his Brother  In what Words shall I speak to my Lord with what Confidence can I say any Thing Our Guilt  is but too apparent we submit to our Fate  We are my Lord's Servants both we and he also with whom the Cup is found  When that is not accep∣ted How pathetically does he recapitulate the whole Story And approaching nearer to  Joseph  delivers himself as follows which if we fix our Thoughts upon the Relation between the Plea∣der and the Judge it is impossible to read with∣out Tears  SIR  Let me intrude so far upon you even in the high Condition in which you are and the miserable One in which you see me and my Brethren to in∣form you of the Circumstances of us unhappy Men that prostrate our selves before you When we were first examined by you you enquired for what Reason my Lord enquired we know not but you enquired whether we had not a Father or a Brother We then acquainted you that we had a Father an old Man who had a Child of his old Age and had buried another Son whom he had by the same Woman You were pleased to command us to bring the Child he had remaining down to you We did so and he has forfeited his Liberty But my Father said to us You know that my Wife bare me Two Sons one of them was torn in Pieces If Mischief befal this also it will bring my Grey Hairs with Sor∣row to the Grave Accept therefore Oh my Lord me for your Bondman and let the Lad return with his Brethren that I may not see the Evil that shall come on my Father Here  Joseph  's Passion grew too great for further Disguise and he reveals himself with Exclamations of Transport and Tenderness  After their Recovery from their first Astonish∣ment his Brethren were seized with Fear for the Injuries they had done him but how generously does he keep them in Countenance and make an  Apology for them  Be not angry with your selves for selling me hither  call it not so but think Pro∣vidence sent me before you to preserve Life  It would be endless to go through all the Beau∣ties of this sacred Narrative but any who shall read it at an Hour when he is disengaged from all other Regard or Interests than what arise from it will feel the alternate Passion of a Father a Brother and a Son so warm in him that they will incline him to exert himself in such of those Characters as happen to be his much above the ordinary Course of his Life  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd Octob  to  Saturd Octob    From my own Apartment  October  I HAVE Reason to believe that certain of my Contemporaries have made Use of an Art I some time ago professed of being often design∣edly dull and for that Reason shall not exert my self when I see them lazy He that has so much to struggle with as the Man who pretends to cen∣sure others must keep up his Fire for an Onset and may be allowed to carry his Arms a little carelesly upon an ordinary March This Paper therefore shall be taken up by my Correspon∣dents Two of which have sent me the Two fol∣lowing plain but sensible and honest Letters upon Subjects no less important than those of Education and Devotion  SIR  I Am an old Man retired from all Acquain∣tance with the Town but what I have from your Papers not the worst Entertainment of  my Solitude yet being still a Wellwisher to my Country and the Commonwealth of Learn∣ing  a qua confitcor nullam Aetatis meae Par∣tem abhorruisse  and hoping the plain Phrase in Writing that was current in my younger Days would have lasted for my Time I was startled at the Picture of modern Politeness transmit∣ted by your ingenious Correspondent and grie∣ved to see our Sterling  English  Language fallen into the Hands of  Clippers  and  Coyners  That mutilated Epistle consisting of  Hippo Rep's  and suchlike enormous Curtailings was a mortify∣ing Spectacle but with the Reserve of Comfort to find this and other Abuses of our MotherTongue so pathetically complained of and to the proper Person for redressing them the Cen∣sor of  Great Britain  He had before represented  the deplorable Ig∣norance that for several Years past has reigned amongst our  English  Writers the great Depravity of our Taste and continual Corruption of our Style  But Sir before you give your self the Trouble of prescribing Remedies for these Distempers which you own will require the greatest Care and Application give me Leave having long had my Eye upon these Mischiefs and Thoughts exercised about them to mention what I hum∣bly conceive to be the Cause of them and in your Friend  Horace's  Words  Quo Fonte derivata Clades in Patriam Populumque fluxit  I take our corrupt Ways of Writing to pro∣ceed from the Mistakes and wrong Measures in our common Methods of  Education  which I al∣ways looked upon as one of our National Grie∣vances and a Singularity that renders us no less than our Situation  Penitus toto divisos Orbe Britannos  This puts me upon consulting the most celebra∣ted Criticks on that Subject to compare our Pra∣ctice  with their Precepts and find where it was that we came short or went wide  But after all I found our Case required some∣thing more than these Doctors had directed and the principal Defect of our  English  Discipline to lie in the  Initiatory  Part which altho' it needs the greatest Care and Skill is usually left to the Conduct of those blind Guides  viz  Chance and Ignorance  I shall trouble you with but a single Instance pursuant to what your sagacious Friend has said That he  could furnish you with a Catalogue of  English  Books that would cost you a Hundred Pounds at first Hand wherein you could not find Ten Lines together of common  Grammar which is a necessary Consequence of our Mismanagement in that Province  For can any Thing be more absurd than our Way of Proceeding in this Part of Literature To push tender Wits into the intricate Mazes of Grammar and a  Latin  Grammer To learn an unknown Art by an unknown Tongue To carry them a dark Roundabout Way to let them in at a BackDoor Whereas by teaching them first the Grammar of their MotherTongue so easy to be learned their Advance to the Grammars of  Latin  and  Greek  would be gradual and easy but our precipitate Way of hurrying them over such a  Gulph  before we have built them a  Bridge  to it is a Shock to their weak Understandings which they seldom or very late recover In the mean Time we wrong Nature and slander Infants who want neither Capacity nor Will to learn till we put them up∣on Service beyond their Strength and then in∣deed we baulk them  The Liberal Arts and Sciences are all beauti∣ful as the  Graces  nor has  Grammar  the se∣vere Mother of all so frightful a Face of her  Own  'tis the  Vizard  put upon it that scares  Children She is made to speak hard Words that to them sound like Conjuring Let her talk intelligibly and they will listen to her  In this I think as on other Accounts we shew our selves true  Britains  always overlook∣ing our natural Advantages It has been the Practice of wisest Nations to learn their own Language by stated Rules to avoid the Confu∣sion that would follow from leaving it to vul∣gar Use Our  English  Tongue says a learned Man is the most determinate in its Constru∣ction and reducible to the fewest Rules What∣ever Language has less Grammar in it is not in∣telligible and whatever has more all that it has more is superfluous for which Reasons he would have it made the Foundation of learning  Latin  and all other Languages  To speak and write without Absurdity the Language of one's Country is commendable in Persons of all Stations and to some indispensi∣bly necessary and to this Purpose I would re∣commend above all Things the having a  Gram∣mar  of our MotherTongue first taught in our Schools which would facilitate our Youths learning their  Latin  and  Greek Grammars  with spare Time for Arithmetick Astronomy Cos∣mography History  c  that would make them pass the Spring of their Life with Profit and Pleasure that is now miserably spent in Gram∣matical Perplexities  But here methinks I see the Reader smile and ready to ask me as the Lawyer did Sexton  Diego  on his bequeathing rich Legacies to the Poor of the Parish Where are these mighty Sums to be raised Where is there such a  Grammar  to be had I will not answer as he did Even where your Worship pleases No it is our good Fortune to have such a  Grammar  with Notes now in the Press and to be published next Term  I hear it is a chargeable Work and wish the Publisher to have Customers of all that have Need of such a Book yet fancy that he can∣not be much a Sufferer if it is only bought by all that have more Need for it than they think they have  A certain Author brought a Poem to Mr  Cow∣ley  for his Perusal and Judgment of the Perfor∣mance which he demanded at the next Visit with a Poetaster's Assurance and Mr  Cowley  with his usual Modesty desired that he would be pleased to look a little to the  Grammar  of it To the  Grammar  of it What do you mean Sir Would you send me to School again Why Mr  H  Would it do you any Harm  This put me on considering how this Voyage of Literature may be made with more Safety and Profit Expedition and Delight and at last for compleating so good a Service to request your Directions in so deplorable a Case hoping that as you have had Compassion on our overgrown Coxcombs in Concerns of less Consequence you will exert your Charity towards Innocents and vouchsafe to be Guardian to the Children and Youth of  Great Britain  in this important Affair of  Education  wherein Mistakes and wrong Mea∣sures have so often occasioned their Aversion to Books that had otherwise proved the chief Or∣nament and Pleasure of their Life I am with sincerest Respect  SIR  Your  c  St Clnts  Oct  Mr  Bickerstaff  I Observe as the Season begins to grow cold so does People's Devotion insomuch that instead of filling the Churches that united Zeal might keep one warm there one is left to freeze  in almost bare Walls by those who in hot Wea∣ther are troublesome the contrary Way This Sir needs a Regulation that none but you can give to it by causing those who absent them∣selves on Account of Weather only this Winter∣time to pay the Apothecaries Bills occasioned by Coughs Catarrhs and other Distempers contracted by sitting in empty Seats Therefore to you I apply my self for Redress having got∣ten such a Cold on  Sunday  was Sevenight that has brought me almost to your Worship's Age from Sixty within less than a Fortnight I am  Your Worship's in all Obedience  W E  The TATLER N  o    Scit Genius natale Comes qui temperat Astrum  Hor  From  Saturd Octob  to  Tuesday Octob    From my own Apartment  October  AMong those Inclinations which are common to all Men there is none more unaccounta∣ble than that unequal Love by which Parents di∣stinguish their Children from each other Some∣times Vanity and Selflove appear to have a Share towards this Effect and in other Instances I have been apt to attribute it to meer Instinct But however that is we frequently see the Child that has been beholden to neither of these Im∣pulses in their Parents in spight of being neg∣lected snubbed and thwarted at Home acquire a Behaviour which makes it as agreeable to all the rest of the World as that of every one else of  their Family is to each other I fell into this Way of Thinking from an Intimacy which I have with a very good House in our Neighbourhood where there are Three Daughters of a very different Character and Genius The eldest has a great deal of Wit and Cunning the Second has good Sense but no Artifice the Third has much Vi∣vacity but little Understanding The First is a fine but scornful Woman the Second is not charming but very winning the Third no Way commendable but very desirable The Father of these young Creatures was ever a great Pretender to Wit the Mother a Woman of as much Coquet∣try This Turn in the Parents has biassed their Affections towards their Children The old Man supposes the eldest of his own Genius and the Mother looks upon the youngest as her self re∣newed By this Means all the Lovers that ap∣proach the House are discarded by the Father for not observing Mrs  Mary  's Wit and Beauty and by the Mother for being blind to the Mien and Air of Mrs  Biddy  Come never so many Preten∣ders they are not suspected to have the least Thoughts of Mrs  Betty  the middle Daughter  Betty  therefore is mortified into a Woman of a great deal of Merit and knows she must depend on that only for her Advancement The middle∣most is thus the Favourite of all her Acquaintance as well as mine while the other Two carry a certain Insolence about them in all Conversations and expect the Partiality which they meet with at Home to attend them wherever they appear So little do Parents understand that they are of all People the least Judges of their Children's Merit that what they reckon such is seldom any Thing else but a Repetition of their own Faults and Infirmities  There is methinks some Excuse for being par∣ticular when one of the Offspring has any Defect in Nature In this Case the Child if we may so  speak is so much the longer the Child of its Pa∣rents and calls for the Continuance of their Care and Indulgence from the Slowness of its Capaci∣ty or the Weakness of its Body But there is no enduring to see Men enamoured only at the Sight of their own Impertinencies repeated and to ob∣serve as we may sometimes that they have a se∣cret Dislike of their Children for a Degeneracy from their very Crimes Commend me to Lady  Goodly  she is equal to all her own Children but prefers them to those of all the World beside My Lady is a perfect Hen in the Care of her Brood she fights and squabbles with all that ap∣pear where they come but is wholly unbiassed in dispensing her Favours among them It is no small Pains she is at to defame all the young Wo∣men in her Neighbourhood by Visits Whispers Intimations and Hearsays all which she ends with thanking Heaven that no one living is so blessed with such obedient and well inclined Chil∣dren as her self Perhaps says she  Betty  cannot dance like Mrs  Frontinett  and it is no great Mat∣ter whether she does or not but she comes into a Room with a good Grace though she says it that should not she looks like a Gentlewoman Then if Mrs  Rebecca  is not so talkative as the mighty Wit Mrs  Clapper  yet she is discreet she knows better what she says when she does speak If her Wit be slow her Tongue never runs before it This kind Parent lifts up her Eyes and Hands in Congratulation of her own good Fortune and is maliciously thankful that none of her Girls are like any of her Neighbours But this Preference of her own to all others is grounded upon an Impulse of Nature while those who like one be∣fore another of their own are so unpardonably unjust that it could hardly be equalled in the Children though they preferred all the rest of the World to such Parents It is no unpleasant Entertainment to see a Ball at a DancingSchool  and observe the Joy of Relations when the young Ones for whom they are concerned are in Mo∣tion You need not be told whom the Dancers belong to At their first Appearance the Passion of their Parents are in their Faces and there is al∣ways a Nod of Approbation stolen at a good Step or a graceful Turn  I remember among all my Acquaintance but one Man whom I have thought to live with his Children with Equanimity and a good Grace He had Three Sons and One Daughter whom he bred with all the Care imaginable in a liberal and ingenuous Way I have often heard him say He had the Weakness to love one much better than the other but that he took as much Pains to cor∣rect that as any other Criminal Passion that could arise in his Mind His Method was to make it the only Pretension in his Children to his Favour to be kind to each other and he would tell them That he who was the best Brother he would reckon the best Son This turned their Thoughts into an Emulation for the Superiority in kind and tender Affection towards each other The Boys behaved themselves very early with a Manly Friendship and their Sister instead of the gross Familiarities and impertinent Freedoms in Behaviour usual in other Houses was always treated by them with as much Complaisance as any other young Lady of their Acquaintance It was an unspeakable Pleasure to visit or sit at Meal in that Family I have often seen the old Man's Heart flow at his Eyes with Joy upon Occasions which would appear indifferent to such as were Strangers to the Turn of his Mind but a very slight Accident wherein he saw his Children's GoodWill to one another created in him the Godlike Pleasure of loving them because they loved each other This great Command of him∣self in hiding his first Impulse to Partiality at last improved to a steady Justice towards them  and that which at first was but an Expedient to correct his Weakness was afterwards the Mea∣sure of his Virtue  The Truth of it is those Parents who are in∣terested in the Care of one Child more than that of another no longer deserve the Name of Pa∣rents but are in Effect as childish as their Chil∣dren in having such unreasonable and ungovern∣ed Inclinations A Father of this Sort has degra∣ded himself into one of his own Offspring for none but a Child would take Part in the Passions of Children  The TATLER N  o    Nescio qua natale Solum Dulcedine Mentem  Tangit immemorem non sinit esse sui  Ovid  From  Tuesday Octob  to  Thursday Octob    From my own Apartment  October  I Find in the Registers of my Family that the Branch of the  Bickerstaffs  from which I am de∣scended came originally out of  Ireland  This has given me a Kind of natural Affection for that Country It is therefore with Pleasure that I see not only some of the greatest Warriors but also of the greatest Wits to be Natives of that King∣dom The Gentleman who writes the following Letter is one of these last The Matter of Fact contained in it is literally true tho' the diverting Manner in which it is told may give it the Colour of a Fable  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  at his House in  Great Britain  Dublin  SIR  FInding by several Passages of your  Tatlers  that you are a Person curious in Natural Knowledge I thought it would not be unac∣ceptable to you to give you the following Histo∣ry of the Migration of Frogs into this Country There is an ancient Tradition among the wild Philosophers of the Kingdom That this whole Island was once as much infested by Frogs as that wherein  Whittington  made his Fortune was by Mice Insomuch that it is said  Mackdonald  the First could no more sleep by reason of these  Dutch  Nightingales as they are called at  Paris  than  Pharaoh  could when they croaked in his BedChamber It was in the Reign of this great Monarch that St  Patrick  arrived in  Ire∣land  being as famous for destroying Vermin as any Ratcatcher of our Times If we may be∣lieve the Tradition he killed more in one Day than a Flock of Storks could have done in a Twelvemonth From that Time for about Five hundred Years there was not a Frog to be heard in  Ireland  notwithstanding the Bogs still remained which in former Ages had been so plentifully stocked with those Inhabitants  When the Arts began to flourish in the Reign of King  Charles  the Second and that great Mo∣narch had placed himself at the Head of the Royal Society to lead them forward into the Discoveries of Nature it is said That several Proposals were laid before his Majesty for the importing of Frogs into  Ireland  In order to it a Virtuoso of known Abilities was unanimously elected by the Society and intrusted with the whole Management of that Affair For this End he took along with him a sound Ablebo∣died Frog of a strong hale Constitution that  had given Proofs of his Vigour by several Leaps which he made before that Learned Body They took Ship and sailed together till they came within Sight of the Hill of  Hoath  before the Frog discovered any Symptoms of being in∣disposed by his Voyage But as the Wind chop∣ped about and began to blow from the  Irish  Coast he grew Seasick or rather Landsick for his learned Companion ascribed it to the Particles of the Soil with which the Wind was impregnated He was confirmed in his Con∣jecture when upon the Wind's turning about his Fellow Traveller sensibly recovered and continued in good Health till his Arrival upon the Shore where he suddenly relapsed and ex∣pired upon a  Ring  's  End  Car in his Way to  Dub∣lin  The same Experiment was repeated seve∣ral Times in that Reign but to no Purpose A Frog was never known to take Three Leaps upon  Irish  Turf before he stretched himself out and died  Whether it were that the Philosophers on this Side the Water despaired of  ocking the Island with this useful Animal or whether in the following Reign it was not thought proper to undo the Miracle of a Popish Saint I do not hear of any further Progress made in this Af∣fair till about Two Years after the Battle of the  Boyne  It was then that an ingenious Physician to the Honour as well as Improvement of his Native Country performed what the  English  had been so long attempting in vain This learned Man with the Hazard of his Life made a Voyage to  Leverpool  where he filled several Barrels with the choicest Spawn of Frogs that could be found in those Parts This Cargo he brought over very carefully and afterwards disposed of it in several warm Beds that he thought most capable of bringing it to Life The Doctor was  a very ingenious Physician and a very good Protestant for which Reason to show his Zeal against Popery he placed some of the most promising Spawn in the very Fountain that is dedicated to the Saint and known by the Name of St  Patrick  's  Well  where these Animals had the Impudence to make their first Appearance They have since that Time very much increased and multiplied in all the Neighbourhood of this City We have here some curious Enquirers into Natural History who observe their Motions with a Design to compute in how many Years they will be able to hop from  Dublin  to  Wex∣ford  tho' as I am inform'd not one of them has yet passed the Mountains of  Wicklow  I am further informed that several Grasiers of the County of  Cork  have entered into a Pro∣ject of planting a Colony in those Parts at the Instance of the  French  Protestants And I know not but the same Design may be on Foot in other Parts of the Kingdom if the Wisdom of the  British  Nation do not think fit to prohibit the further Importation of  English  Frogs I am  SIR  Your most humble Servant  T B  There is no Study more becoming a rational Creature than that of Natural Philosophy but as several of our modern Virtuoso's manage it their Speculations do not so much tend to open and enlarge the Mind as to contract and fix it upon Trifles  This in  England  is in a great Measure owing to the worthy Elections that are so frequently made in our Royal Society They seem to be in a Con∣federacy against Men of polite Genius noble Thought and diffusive Learning and chuse into their Assemblies such as have no Pretence to Wis∣dom but Want of Wit or to natural Know∣ledge  but Ignorance of every Thing else I have made Observations in this Matter so long that when I meet with a young Fellow that is an humble Admirer of the Sciences but more dull than the rest of the Company I conclude him to be a Fellow of the Royal Society  The TATLER N  o    In nova fert Animus mutatas dicere Formas  Corpora  Ovid  From  Thursd Octob  to  Saturd Octob    From my own Apartment  October  COming Home last Night before my usual Hour I took a Book into my Hand in or∣der to divert my self with it till Bedtime  Mil∣ton  chanced to be my Author whose admirable Poem of  Paradise Lost  serves at once to fill the Mind with pleasing Idea's and with good Thoughts and was therefore the most proper Book for my Purpose I was amusing my self with that beautiful Passage in which the Poet re∣presents  Eve  sleeping by  Adam  's Side with the Devil sitting at her Ear and inspiring evil Thoughts under the Shape of a Toad  Ithuriel  one of the Guardian Angels of the Place walking his Nightly Rounds saw the great Enemy of Mankind hid in this loathsome Animal which he touched with his Spear This Spear being of a Celestial Temper had such a secret Virtue in it that whatever it was applied to immediately flung off all Disguise and appeared in its natu∣ral Figure I am afraid the Reader will not par∣don me if I content my self with explaining the  Passage in Prose without giving it in the Author's own inimitable Words  On he led his radiant Files  Dazzling the Morn These to the Bower direct  In Search of whom they sought Him there they found  Squat like a Toad close at the Ear of  Eve  Essaying by his devilish Art to reach  The Organs of her Fancy and with them forge  Illusions as he list Phantasms and Dreams  Or if inspiring Venom he might taint  The Animal Spirits that from pure Blood arise  Like gentle Breaths from Rivers pure thence raise  At least distemper'd discontented Thoughts  Vain Hopes vain Aims inordinate Destres  Blown up with high Conceits ingendring Pride  Him thus intent  Ithuriel  with his Spear  Touch'd lightly for no Falshood can endure  Touch of Celestial Temper but returns  Of Force to his own Likeness Up he starts  Discover'd and surpriz'd As when a Spark  Lights on a Heap of nitrous Powder laid  Fit for the Tun some Magazine to store  Against a rumour'd War the smutty Grain  With sudden Blaze diffus'd inflames the Air  So started up in his own Shape the Fiend  I could not forbear thinking how happy a Man would be in the Possession of this Spear or what an Advantage it would be to a Minister of State were he Master of such a White Staff It would let him discover his Friends from his Enemies Men of Abilities from Pretenders It would hin∣der him from being imposed upon by Appea∣rances and Professions and might be made use of as a Kind of State Test which no Artifice could elude  These Thoughts made very lively Impressions on my Imagination which were improv'd in∣stead of being defaced by Sleep and produced in me the following Dream I was no sooner fallen  asleep but methoughts the Angel  Ithuriel  ap∣peared to me and with a Smile that still added to his Celestial Beauty made me a Present of the Spear which he held in his Hand and disappear∣ed To make Trial of it I went into a Place of publick Resort  The first Person that passed by me was a Lady that had a particular Shyness in the Cast of her Eye and a more than ordinary Reservedness in all the Parts of her Behaviour She seemed to look upon Man as an obscene Creature with a certain Scorn and Fear of him In the Height of her Airs I touched her gently with my Wand when to my unspeakable Surprize she fell upon her Back and kick'd up her Heels in such a Man∣ner as made me blush in my Sleep As I was hasting away from this undisguised Prude I saw a Lady in earnest Discourse with another and overheard her say with some Vehemence Never tell me of him for I am resolv'd to die a Vir∣gin I had a Curiosity to try her but as soon as I laid my Wand upon her Head she immediately fell in Labour My Eyes were diverted from her by a Man and his Wife who walked near me Hand in Hand after a very loving Manner I gave each of them a gentle Tap and the next Instant saw the Woman in Breeches and the Man with a Fan in his Hand It would be tedious to describe the long Series of Metamorphoses that I entertained my self with in my Night's Adven∣ture of Whigs disguised in Tories and Tories in Whigs Men in Red Coats that denounced Ter∣ror in their Countenances trembling at the Touch of my Spear others in Black with Peace in their Mouths but Swords in their Hands I could tell Stories of Noblemen changed into Usurers and Magistrates into Beadles of FreeThinkers into Penitents and Reformers into Whoremasters I must not however omit the Mention of a grave Citizen that passed by me with an huge Clasped  Bible under his Arm and a Band of a most im∣moderate Breadth but upon a Touch on the Shoulder he let drop his Book and fell a picking my Pocket  In the general I observed that those who ap∣peared good often disappointed my Expectation but that on the contrary those who appeared ve∣ry bad still grew worse upon the Experiment as the Toad in  Milton  which one would have thought the most deformed Part of the Creation at  Ithuriel  's Stroke became more deformed and started up into a Devil  Among all the Persons that I touched there was but one who stood the Test of my Wand and after many Repetitions of the Stroke stuck to his Form and remained steady and fixed in his first Appearance This was a young Man who boasted of foul Distempers wild Debauches In∣sults upon holy Men and Affronts to Religion  My Heart was extremely troubled at this Vi∣sion The Contemplation of the whole Species so entirely sunk in Corruption filled my Mind with a Melancholy that is inexpressible and my Discoveries still added to my Affliction  In the Midst of these Sorrows which I had in my Heart methoughts there passed by me a Cou∣ple of Coaches with Purple Liveries There sate in each of them a Person with a very venerable Aspect At the Appearance of them the People who were gathered round me in great Multi∣tudes divided into Parties as they were disposed to favour either of those reverend Persons The Enemies of one of them begged me to touch him with my Wand and assured me I should see his Lawn converted into a Cloak The opposite Par∣ty told me with as much Assurance That if I laid my Wand upon the other I should see his Garments embroidered with FlowerdeLuces and his Head covered with a Cardinal's Cap I made the Experiment and to my great Joy saw  them both without any Change distributing their Blessings to the People and praying for those who had reviled them Is it possible thought I that good Men who are so few in Number should be divided among themselves and give better Quarter to the Vicious that are in their Party than the most strictly Virtuous who are out of it Are the Ties of Faction above those of ReligionI was going on in my Soli∣loquies but some sudden Accident awakened me when I found my Hand grasped but my Spear gone The Reflection on so very odd a Dream made me figure to my self What a strange Face the World would bear should all Mankind appear in their proper Shapes and Characters without Hypocrisy and Disguise I am afraid the Earth we live upon would appear to other in∣tellectual Beings no better than a Planet peopled with Monsters This should methinks inspire us with an honest Ambition of recommending our selves to those invisible Spies and of being what we would appear There was one Circum∣stance in my foregoing Dream which I at first intended to conceal but upon second Thoughts I cannot look upon my self as a candid and im∣partial Historian if I do not acquaint my Reader that upon taking  Ithuriel  's Spear into my Hand though I was before an old decrepid Fellow I appeared a very handsome jolly black Man But I know my Enemies will say this is praising my own Beauty for which Reason I will speak no more of it  The TATLER N  o    Poetica surgit  Tempestas  Juv  From  Saturd Octob  to  Tuesd Octob    From my own Apartment  October  STorms at Sea are so frequently described by the ancient Poets and copied by the Moderns that whenever I find the Winds begin to rise in a new Heroick Poem I generally skip a Leaf or Two till I come into Fair Weather  Virgil  's  Tempest  is a Masterpiece in this Kind and is in∣deed so naturally drawn that one who has made a Voyage can scarce read it without being Sea∣sick  Land Showers are no less frequent among the Poets than the former but I remember none of them which have not fallen in the Country for which Reason they are generally filled with the Lowings of Oxen and the Bleatings of Sheep and very often embellished with a Rainbow  Virgil  's  Land Shower  is likewise the best in its Kind It is indeed a Shower of Consequence and contributes to the main Design of the Poem by cutting off a tedious Ceremonial and bringing Matters to a speedy Conclusion between Two Po∣tentates of different Sexes My ingenious Kins∣man Mr  Humphry Wagstaff  who treats of every Subject after a Manner that no other Author has done and better than any other can do has sent me the Description of a City Shower I do not question but the Reader remembers my Cousin's Description of the Morning as it breaks in Town  which is printed in the th  Tatler  and is another exquisite Piece of this Local Poetry  Careful Observers may foretel the Hour  By sure Prognosticks when to dread a Show'r  While Rain depends the

   Mecum certasse feretur  Ovid  From  Tuesd Octob  to  Thursd Octob    From my own Apartment  Octob  IT is ridiculous for any Man to criticise on the Works of another who has not distinguished himself by his own Performances A Judge would make but an indifferent Figure who had never been known at the Bar  Cicero  was reputed the greatest Orator of his Age and Country before he wrote a Book  De Oratore  and  Horace  the great∣est Poet before he published his  Art of Poetry  This Observation arises naturally in any one who casts his Eye upon this last mentioned Author where he will find the Criticisms placed in the latter End of his Book that is after the finest Odes and Satyrs in the  Latin  Tongue  A Modern whose Name I shall not mention because I would not make a silly Paper sell was born a Critick and an Examiner and like one of the Race of the Serpent's Teeth came into the World with a Sword in his Hand His Works put me in mind of the Story that is told of a  Ger∣man  Monk who was taking a Catalogue of a Friend's Library and meeting with a  Hebrew  Book in it entered it under the Title of  A Book that has the Beginning where the End should be  This Author in the last of his Crudities has amas∣sed together a Heap of Quotations to prove that  Horace  and  Virgil  were both of them modester Men than my self and if his Works were to live as long as mine they might possibly give Poste∣rity a Notion that  Isaac Bickerstaff  was a very  conceited old Fellow and as vain a Man as either  Tully  or Sir  Francis Bacon  Had this serious Wri∣ter fallen upon me only I could have overlook∣ed it but to see  Cicero  abused is I must confess what I cannot bear The Censure he passes upon this great Man runs thus  The Itch of being very Abusive is almost inseparable from VainGlory  Tully  has these Two Faults in so high a Degree that nothing but his being the best Writer in the World can make Amends for them  The scurrilous Wretch goes on to say I am as bad as  Tully  His Words are these  And yet the  Tatler  in his Paper of  Sep∣tember  has outdone him in both He speaks of himself with more Arrogance and with more Inso∣lence of others  I am afraid by his Discourse this Gentleman has no more read  Plutarch  than he has  Tully  If he had he would have observed a Pas∣sage in that Historian wherein he has with great Delicacy distinguish'd between Two Passions which are usually complicated in Humane Nature and which an ordinary Writer would not have thought of separating Not having my  Greek  Spectacles by me I shall quote the Passage Word for Word as I find it translated to my Hand  Nevertheless tho' he was intemperately fond of his own Praise yet he was very free from envying others and most li∣berally profuse in commending both the Ancients and his Contemporaries as is to be understood by his Wri∣tings and many of those Sayings are still recorded as that concerning  Aristotle  That he was a River of flowing Gold Of  Plato  's Dialogue That if  Jupi∣ter  were to speak he would discourse as he did  Theophrastus  he was wont to call his peculiar De∣light and being asked Which of  Demosthenes  his Orations he liked best He answered The longest  And as for the Eminent Men of his own Time ei∣ther for Eloquence or Philosophy there was not one of them which he did not by writing or speaking fa∣vourably of render more illustrious  Thus the Critick tells us That  Cicero  was ex∣cessively vainglorious and abusive  Plutarch  that he was vain but not abusive Let the Reader be∣lieve which of them he pleases  After this he complains to the World that I call him Names and that in my Passion I said He was  a Flea a Louse an Owl a Bat a small Wit a Scribbler and a Nibbler  When he has thus be∣spoken his Reader's Pity he falls into that admi∣rable Vein of Mirth which I shall set down at length it being an exquisite Piece of Raillery and written in great Gaiety of Heart  After this List of Names    viz  Flea Louse Owl Bat  c    I was surprised to hear him say that he has hitherto kept his Temper pretty well I wonder how he will write when he has lost his Temper I suppose as he now is very angry and unmannerly he will then be ex∣ceeding courteous and goodhumoured  If I can outlive this Raillery I shall be able to bear any Thing  There is a Method of Criticism made Use of by this Author for I shall take Care how I call him a Scribbler again which may turn into Ridicule any Work that was ever written wherein there is a Variety of Thoughts This the Reader will observe in the following Words  He  meaning me  is so intent upon being something extraordina∣ry that he scarce knows what he would be and is as fruitful in his Similes as a Brother of his whom I lately took Notice of In the Compass of a few Lines he compares himself to a Fox to  Daniel Burgess  to the Knight of the Red Cross to an Oak with Ivy about it and to a great Man with an Equipage  I think my self as much honoured by being joined in this Part of his Paper with the Gentleman whom he here calls my Brother as I am in the Beginning of it by being mentioned with  Horace  and  Virgil  It is very hard that a Man cannot publish Ten Papers without stealing from himself but to show you that this is only a Knack of Writing and that  the Author is got into a certain Road of Criticism I shall set down his Remarks on the Works of the Gentleman whom he here glances upon as they stand in his th Paper and desire the Reader to compare them with the foregoing Passage upon mine  In Thirty Lines his Patron is a River the  Primum Mobile  a Pilot a Victim the Sun any Thing and Nothing He bestows Increase conceals his Source makes the Machine move teaches to steer expiates our Offences raises Vapours and looks larger as he sets  What Poem can be safe from this Sort of Criti∣cism I think I was never in my Life so much offended as at a Wag whom I once met with in a Coffeehouse He had in his Hand one of the Miscellanies and was reading the following short Copy of Verses which without Flattery to the Author is I think as beautiful in its Kind as any one in the  English  Tongue  Flavia  the least and flight est Toy  Can with resistless Art employ  This Fan in meaner Hands would prove  An Engine of small Force in Love  But she with such an Air and Mien  Not to be told or safely seen  Directs its wanton Motions so  That it wounds more than  Cupid  's Bow  Gives Coolness to the matchless Dame  To ev'ry other Breast a Flame  When this Coxcomb had done reading them Heyday says he What Instrument is this that  Flavia  employs in such a Manner as is not to be told nor safely seen In Ten Lines it is a Toy a  Cupid  's Bow a Fan and an Engine in Love It has wanton Motions it wounds it cools and in∣flames  Such Criticisms make a Man of Sense sick and a Fool merry  The next Paragraph of the Paper we are talk∣ing of falls upon some Body whom I am at a Loss to guess at But I find the whole Invective turns upon a Man who it seems has been impri∣soned for Debt Whoever he was I must hear∣tily pity him but at the same Time must put the Examiner in Mind that notwithstanding he is a Critick he still ought to remember he is a Chri∣stian Poverty was never thought a proper Sub∣ject for Ridicule and I do not remember that I ever met with a Satyr upon a Beggar  As for those little Retortings of my own Ex∣pressions of  being dull by Design witty in  October  shining excelling  and so forth they are the com∣mon Cavils of every Witlin who has no other Method of showing his Parts but by little Varia∣tions and Repetitions of the Man's Words whom he attacks  But the Truth of it is the Paper before me not only in this Particular but in its very Essence is like  Ovid  's Eccho  Quae nec reticere loquenti  Nec prior ipsa loqui didicit  I should not have deserved the Character of a Censor had I not animadverted upon the above∣mentioned Author by a gentle Chastisement But I know my Reader will not pardon me unless I declare that nothing of this Nature for the future unless it be written with some Wit shall divert me from my Care of the Publick  The TATLER N  o    Ad Populum Phaleras  Pers  From  Thursd Octob  to  Saturd Octob    From my own Apartment  Octob  I DO not remember that in any of my Lucu∣brations I have touched upon that useful Sci∣ence of Physick notwithstanding I have declared my self more than once a Professor of it I have indeed joined the Study of Astrology with it be∣cause I never knew a Physician recommend him∣self to the Publick who had not a Sister Art to embellish his Knowledge in Medicine It has been commonly observed in Compliment to the Inge∣nious of our Profession that  Apollo  was God of Verse as well as Physick and in all Ages the most celebrated Practitioners of our Country were the particular Favourites of the Muses Poetry to Physick is indeed like the Gilding to a Pill it makes the Art shine and covers the Severity of the Doctor with the Agreeableness of the Com∣panion  The very Foundation of Poety is good Sense if we may allow  Harace  to be a Judge of the Art  Scribendi recte sapere est Principium Fons  And if so we have Reason to believe that the same Man who writes well can prescribe well if he has applied himself to the Study of both Be∣sides when we see a Man making Profession of Two different Sciences it is natural for us to be∣lieve he is no Pretender in that which we are not Judges of when we find him skilful in that which we understand  Ordinary Quacks and Charlatans are throughly sensible how necessary it is to support themselves by these collateral Assistances and therefore al∣ways lay their Claim to some supernumerary Ac∣complishments which are wholly foreign to their Profession  About Years ago it was impossible to walk the Streets without having an Advertisement thrust into your Hand of a Doctor  who was arrived at the Knowledge of the Green and Red Dragon and had discovered the Female Fern Seed  No Body ever knew what this meant but the Green and Red Dragon so amused the People that the Doctor li∣ved very comfortably upon them About the same Time there was pasted a very hard Word upon every Corner of the Streets This to the best of my Remembrance was  TETRACHYMAGOGON  Which drew great Shoals of Spectators about it who read the Bill that it introduced with un∣speakable Curiosity and when they were sick would have no Body but this learned Man for their Physician  I once received an Advertisement of one  who had studied Thirty Years by Candlelight for the Good of his Countrymen  He might have studied Twice as long by Daylight and never have been taken Notice of But Lucubrations cannot be overvalued There are some who have gained themselves great Reputation for Physick by their Birth as the  Seventh Son of a Seventh Son  and others by not being born at all as the  Unborn Doctor  who I hear is lately gone the Way of his Patients having died worth Five Hundred Pounds  per Annum  though he was not  born  to a Halfpenny  My ingenious Friend Doctor  Saffold  succeeded my old Contemporary Doctor  Lilly  in the Studies both of Physick and Astrology to which he ad∣ded  that of Poetry as was to be seen both upon the Sign where he lived and in the Bills which he distributed He was succeeded by Doctor  Case  who erased the Verses of his Predecessor out of the SignPost and substituted in their Stead Two of his own which were as follow  Within this Place  Lives Doctor  Case  He is said to have got more by this Distich than Mr  Dryden  did by all his Works There would be no End of enumerating the several imaginary Per∣fections and unaccountable Artifices by which this Tribe of Men ensnare the Minds of the Vulgar and gain Crowds of Admirers I have seen the whole Front of a Mountebank's Stage from one End to the other faced with Patents Certificates Medals and Great Seals by which the several Princes of  Europe  have testified their particular Re∣spect and Esteem for the Doctor Every great Man with a sounding Title has been his Patient I be∣lieve I have seen Twenty Mountebanks that have given Physick to the Czar of  Moscovy  The Great Duke of  Tuscany  escapes no better The Elector of  Brandenburg  was likewise a very good Patient  This great Condescension of the Doctor draws upon him much GoodWill from his Audience and it is Ten to One but if any of them be trou∣bled with an aching Tooth his Ambition will prompt him to get it drawn by a Person who has had so many Princes Kings and Emperors under his Hands  I must not leave this Subject without observing that as Physicians are apt to deal in Poetry Apo∣thecaries endeavour to recommend themselves by Oratory and are therefore without Controversy the most eloquent Persons in the whole  British  Na∣tion I would not willingly discourage any of the Arts especially that of which I am an humble Pro∣fessor but I must confess for the Good of my  native Country I could wish there might be a Sus∣pension of Physick for some Years that our King∣dom which has been so much exhausted by the Wars might have Leave to recruit it self  As for my self the only Physick which has brought me safe to almost the Age of Man and which I prescribe to all my Friends is Abstinence This is certainly the best Physick for Prevention and very often the most effectual against a present Distemper In short my  Recipe  is  Take nothing  Were the Body Politick to be physick'd like particular Persons I should venture to prescribe to it after the same Manner I remember when our wholeIsland was shaken with an Earthquake some Years ago there was an impudent Mountebank who sold Pills which as he told the Country People were very good against an Earthquake It may perhaps be thought as absurd to prescribe a Diet for the allaying Popular Commotions and National Ferments But I am verily perswaded that if in such a Case a whole People were to en∣ter into a Course of Abstinence and eat nothing but Watergruel for a Fortnight it would abate the Rage and Animosity of Parties and not a lit∣tle contribute to the Cure of a distracted Nation Such a Fast would have a natural Tendency to the procuring of those Ends for which a Fast is usually proclaimed If any Man has a Mind to enter on such a voluntary Abstinence it might not be improper to give him the Caution of  Py∣thagoras  in particular  Abstine a Fabis  ' Abstain from Beans  That is say the Interpreters Meddle not with Elections Beans having been made Use of by the Voters among the  Athenians  in the Choice of Ma∣gistrates  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturd Octob  to  Tuesd Octob    From my own Apartment  Octob  A Method of spending one's Time agreeably is a Thing so little studied that the common Amusement of our young Gentlemen especially of such as are at a Distance from those of the first Breeding is Drinking This Way of Entertain∣ment has Custom of its Side but as much as it has prevailed I believe there have been very few Companies that have been guilty of Excess this Way where there have not happened more Acci∣dents which make against than for the Continu∣ance of it It is very common that Events arise from a Debauch which are fatal and always such as are disagreeable With all a Man's Reason and good Sense about him his Tongue is apt to utter Things out of meer Gaiety of Heart which may displease his best Friends Who then would trust himself to the Power of Wine without saying more against it than that it raises the Imagination and depresses the Judgment Were there only this single Consideration That we are less Masters of our selves when we drink in the least Proportion above the Exigencies of Thirst I say were this all that could be objected it were sufficient to make us abhor this Vice But we may go on to say that as he who drinks but a little is not Ma∣ster of himself so he who drinks much is a Slave to himself As for my Part I ever esteemed a Drunkard of all vicious Persons the most vicious For if our Actions are to be weighed and consi∣dered according to the Intention of them what can we think of him who puts himself into a Cir∣cumstance  wherein he can have no Intention at all but incapacitates himself for the Duties and Of∣fices of Life by a Suspension of all his Faculties If a Man considered that he cannot under the Op∣pression of Drink be a Friend a Gentleman a Ma∣ster or a Subject that he has so long banished himself from all that is dear and given up all that is sacred to him he would even then think of a Debauch with Horror But when he looks still further and acknowledges that he is not only expelled out of all the Relations of Life but also liable to offend against them all What Words can express the Terror and Detestation he would have of such a Condition And yet he owns all this of himself who says he was drunk last Night  As I have all along persisted in it that all the Vicious in general are in a State of Death so I think I may add to the NonExistence of Drunk∣ards that they died by their own Hands He is certainly as guilty of Suicide who perishes by a slow as he that is dispatched by an immediate Poison In my last Lucubration I proposed the general Use of Watergruel and hinted that it might not be amiss at this very Season But as there are some whose Cases in regard to their Families will not admit of Delay I have used my Interest in several Wards of the City that the wholesome Restorative abovementioned may be given in Tavern Kitchens to all the Mornings Draught Men within the Walls when they call for Wine before Noon For a further Restraint and Mark upon such Persons I have given Orders that in all the Offices where Policies are drawn upon Lives it shall be added to the Article which prohibits that the Nominee should cross the Sea the Words  Provided also That the abovemention∣ed  A B  shall not drink before Dinner during the Term mentioned in this Indenture  I am not without Hopes but by this Method I shall bring some unsizeable Friends of mine into  Shape and Breath as well as others who are languid and consumptive into Health and Vigour Most of the SelfMurderers whom I yet hinted at are such as preserve a certain Regularity in taking their Poison and make it mix pretty well with their Food But the most conspicuous of those who destroy themselves are such as in their Youth fall into this Sort of Debauchery and contract a certain Uneasiness of Spirit which is not to be diverted but by Tippling as often as they can fall into Company in the Day and conclude with downright Drunkenness at Night These Gen∣tlemen never know the Satisfaction of Youth but skip the Years of Manhood and are decrepid soon after they are of Age I was Godfather to one of these old Fellows He is now Three and Thirty which is the Grand Climacterick of a young Drunkard I went to visit the crazy Wretch this Morning with no other Purpose but to rally him under the Pain and Uneasiness of being sober  But as out Faults are double when they affect others besides our selves so this Vice is still more odious in a married than a single Man He that is the Husband of a Woman of Honour and comes Home overloaded with Wine is still more con∣temptible in Proportion to the Regard we have to the unhappy Consort of his Bestiality The Ima∣gination cannot shape to its self any Thing more monstrous and unnatural than the Familiarities between Drunkenness and Chastity The wretch∣ed  Astraea  who is the Perfection of Beauty and In∣nocence has long been thus condemned for Life The Romantick Tales of Virgins devoted to the Jaws of the Monsters have nothing in them so terrible as the Gift of  Astraea  to that Bacchanal  The Reflection of such a Match as spotless In∣nocence with abandoned Lewdness is what puts this Vice in the worst Figure it can bear with Re∣gard to others but when it is looked upon with Respect only to the Drunkard himself it has De∣formities  enough to make it disagreeable which may be summed up in a Word by allowing that he who resigns his Reason is actually guilty of all that he is liable to from the Want of Reason  P S  Among many other Enormities there are Two in the following Letters which I think should be suddenly amended but since they are Sins of Omission only I shall not make Remarks upon them till I find the Delinquents persist in their Errors and the inserting the Letters themselves shall be all their present Admonition  October  Mr  Bickerstaff  SEveral that frequent Divine Service at S  Paul  's as well as my self having with great Satis∣faction observed the good Effect which your Animadversion had on an Excess in Performance

will resemble an Audience at a Playhouse or rather a dumb Meeting of Qua∣kers Your censuring such Churchmutes in the Manner you think fit may make these Dis∣senters join with us out of Fear lest you should further animadvert upon their Non Conformity According as this succeeds you shall hear from  SIR  Your most humble Servant  B B  Mr  Bickerstaff  I Was the other Day in Company with a Gen∣tleman who in reciting his own Qualifica∣tions concluded every Period with these Words  The best of any Man in  England Thus for Exam∣ple He kept the best House of any Man in  Eng∣land  he understood this and that and t'other  the best of any Man in  England  How harsh and ungrateful soever this Expression might sound to one of my Nation yet the Gentleman was one whom it no Ways became me to inter∣rupt but perhaps a new Term put into his ByWords as they call a Sentence a Man particular∣ly affects may cure him I therefore took a Resolution to apply to you who I dare say can easily perswade this Gentleman whom I cannot believe an Enemy to the Union to mend his Phrase and be hereafter the wisest of any Man in  Great Britain  I am  SIR  Your most humble Servant  Scoto Britannus

Oct  to  Tursday Oct    From my own Apartment  October  IT was with very great Displeasure I heard this Day a Man say of a Companion of his with an Air of Approbation  You know  Tom  never fails of saying a spightful Thing  He has a great deal of Wit but Satyr is his particular Talent  Did you mind how he put the young Fellow out of Counte∣nance that pretended to talk to him  Such imper∣tinent Applauses which one meets with every Day put me upon considering what true Raillery and Satyr were in themselves and this me∣thought occurred to me from Reflection upon the great and excellent Persons that were admi∣red for Talents this Way When I had ran over several such in my Thoughts I concluded how∣ever unaccountable the Assertion might appear at first Sight that GoodNature was an essential Quality in a Satyrist and that all the Sentiments which are beautiful in this Way of Writing must proceed from that Quality in the Author GoodNature produces a Disdain of all Baseness Vice and Folly which prompts them to express them∣selves with Smartness against the Errors of Men without Bitterness towards their Persons This Quality keeps the Mind in Equanimity and ne∣ver lets an Offence unseasonably throw a Man out of his Character When  Virgil  said He that did not hate  Bavius  might love  Maevius  he  was in perfect good Humour and was not so much moved at their Absurdities as passionately to call them Sots or Blockheads in a direct In∣vective but laughed at them with a Delicacy of Scorn without any Mixture of Anger  The best good Man with the worstnatured Muse  was the Character among us of a Gentleman as famous for his Humanity as his Wit  The ordinary Subjects for Satyr are such as in∣cite the greatest Indignation in the best Tem∣pers and consequently Men of such a Make are the best qualified for speaking of the Offences in Humane Life These Men can behold Vice and Folly when they injure Persons to whom they are wholly unacquainted with the same Severity as others resent the Ills they do themselves A goodnatured Man cannot see an overbearing Fellow put a bashful Man of Merit out of Coun∣tenance or outstrip him in the Pursuit of any Advantage but he is on Fire to succour the Op∣pressed to produce the Merit of the one and confront the Impudence of the other  The Men of the greatest Character in this Kind were  Horace  and  Juvenal  There is not that I remember one illnatured Expression in all their Writings not one Sentence of Severity which does not apparently proceed from the contrary Disposition Whoever reads them will I be∣lieve be of this Mind and if they were read with this View it may possibly perswade our young Fellows that they may be very witty Men without speaking ill of any but those who deserve it But in the Perusal of these Writers it may not be unnecessary to consider that they lived in very different Times  Horace  was inti∣mate with a Prince of the greatest Goodness and Humanity imaginable and his Court was formed after his Example Therefore the Faults that Poet falls upon were little Inconsistencies in Behaviour false Pretences to Politeness or im∣pertinent  Affectations of what Men were not fit for Vices of a coarser Sort could not come un∣der his Consideration or enter the Palace of  Au∣gustus Juvenal  on the other Hand lived under  Domitian  in whose Reign every Thing that was great and noble was banished the Habitations of the Men in Power Therefore he attacks Vice as it passes by in Triumph not as it breaks into Conversation The Fall of Empire Contempt of Glory and a general Degeneracy of Manners are before his Eyes in all his Writings In the Days of  Augustus  to have talked like  Juvenal  had been Madness or in those of  Domitian  like  Horace  Morality and Virtue are every where re∣commended in  Horace  as became a Man in a po∣lite Court from the Beauty the Propriety the Convenience of pursuing them Vice and Corruption are attacked by  Juvenal  in a Style which denotes he fears he shall not be heard without he calls to them in their own Language with a barefaced Mention of the Villanies and Obscenities of his Contemporaries  This accidental Talk of these Two great Men runs me from my Design which was to tell some Coxcombs that run about this Town with the Name of Smart Satyrical Fellows that they are by no Means qualified for the Characters they pretend to of being severe upon other Men for they want GoodNature There is no Founda∣tion in them for arriving at what they aim at and they may as well pretend to flatter as rail agreeably without being GoodNatured  There is a certain Impartiality necessary to make what a Man says bear any Weight with those he speaks to This Quality with Respect to Men's Errors and Vices is never seen but in Goodnatured Men They have ever such a Frankness of Mind and Benevolence to all Men that they cannot receive Impressions of Unkind∣ness without mature Deliberation and writing  or speaking ill of a Man upon Personal Conside∣ratious is so irreparable and mean an Injury that no o  ssessed of this Quality is capable of do∣ing it But in all Ages there have been Interpre∣ters to A  rs when living of the same Genius with the Commentators into whose Hands they fall when dead I dare say it is impossible for any Man of  e Wit than one of these to take any of the F  and twenty Letters and form out of them a Name to describe the Character of a Vicious Man with greater Life but one of these would immediately cry Mr such a one is meant in that Place But the Truth of it is Sa∣tyrists describe the Age and Backbiters assign their Descriptions to private Men  In all Terms of Reproof when the Sentence appears to arise from Personal Hatred or Passion it is not then made the Cause of Mankind but a Misunderstanding between Two Persons For this Reason the Representations of a Goodna∣tured Man bear a Pleasantry in them which shows there is no Malignity at heart and by Consequence are attended to by his Hearers or Readers because they are unprejudiced This Deference is only what is due to him for no Man thoroughly nettled can say a Thing general enough to pass off with the Air of an Opinion declared and not a Passion gratified I remem∣ber a humorous Fellow at  Oxford  when he heard any one had spoken ill of him used to say  I won't take my Revenge on him till I have forgiven him  What he meant by this was that he would not enter upon this Subject till it was grown as indifferent to him as any other and I have by this Rule seen him more than once triumph over his Adversary with an inimitable Spirit and Humour for he came to the Assault against a Man full of sore Places and he himself invulnerable  There is no Possibility of succeeding in a Sa∣tyrical Way of Writing or Speaking except a Man throws himself quite out of the Question It is great Vanity to think any one will attend a Thing because it is your Quarrel You must make your Satyr the Concern of Society in ge∣neral if you would have it regarded When it is so the GoodNature of a Man of Wit will prompt him to many brisk and disdainful Senti∣ments and Replies to which all the Malice in the World will not be able to repartee  The TATLER N  o    Insert se Septus Nebulâ mirabile dictu  Permedios miscotqua Viris neque cernitur ulli  Virg  From  Thursd Octob  to  Saturd Octob    From my own Apartment  Octob  I Have somewhere made Mention of  Gyges  's Ring and intimated to my Reader that it was at present in my Possession though I have not since made any Use of it The Tradition con∣cerning this Ring is very Romantick and taken Notice of both by  Plato  and  Tully  who each of them make an admirable Use of it for the Ad∣vancement of Morality This  Gyges  was the Ma∣ster Shepherd to King  Candaules  As he was wandering over the Plains of  Lydia  he saw a great Chasm in the Earth and had the Curiosity to enter it After having descended pretty far into it he found the Statue of an Horse in Brass with Doors in the Sides of it Upon opening of them he found the Body of a dead Man big∣ger than ordinary with a Ring upon his Fin∣ger  which he took off and put it upon his own The Virtues of it were much greater than he at first imagined for upon his going into the As∣sembly of Shepherds he observed that he was invisible when he turned the Stone of the Ring within the Palm of his Hand and visible when he turned it towards his Company Had  Plato  and  Cicers  been as well versed in the Occult Sciences as I am they would have found a great deal of Mystick Learning in this Tradition but it is impossible for an Adept to be understood by one who is not an Adept  As for my self I have with much Study and Application arrived at this great Secret of ma∣king my self invisible and by that Means con∣veying my self where I pleased or to speak in Rosycrucian Lore I have entered into the Clefts of the Earth discovered the Brazen Horse and robbed the dead Giant of his Ring The Tradi∣tion says further of  Gyges  that by the Means of this Ring he gained Admission into the most re∣tired Parts of the Court and made such Use of those Opportunities that he at length became King of  Lydia  For my own Part I who have always rather endeavoured to improve my Mind than my Fortune have turned this Ring to no other Advantage than to get a thorough Insight into the Ways of Men and to make such Obser∣vations upon the Errors of others as may be use∣ful to the Publick whatever Effect they may have upon my self  About a Week ago not being able to sleep I got up and put on my magical Ring and with a Thought transported my self into a Chamber where I saw a Light I found it inhabited by a celebrated Beauty though she is of that Species of Women whith we call a Slattern Her Head∣dress and one of her Shoes lay upon a Chair her Petticoat in one Corner of the Room and her Girdle that had a Copy of Verses made upon  it but the Day before with her Thread Stock∣ings in the middle of the Floor I was so foo∣lishly officious that I could not forbear gather∣ing up her Cloaths together to lay them upon the Chair that stood by her Bedside when to my great Surprise after a little Muttering she cried out  What do you do Let my Petticoat alone  I was startled at first but soon found that she was in a Dream being one of those who to use  Shakespear  's Expression are  so loose of Thought  that they utter in their Sleep every Thing that passes in their Imagination I left the Apartment of this Female Rake and went into her Neigh∣bours where there lay a MaleCoquet He had a Bottle of Salts hanging over his Head and upon the Table by his Bedside  Suckling  's Poems with a little Heap of Black Patches on it His Snuff Box was within Reach on a Chair But while I was admiring the Disposition which he made of the several Parts of his Dress his Slumber seemed interrupted by a Pang that was accompanied by a sudden Oath as he turned himself over hastily in his Bed I did not care for seeing him in his nocturnal Pains and left the Room  I was no sooner got into another BedChamber but I heard very harsh Words uttered in a smooth uniform Tone I was amazed to hear so great a Volubility in Reproach and thought it too cohe∣rent to be spoken by one asleep but upon look∣ing nearer I saw the Head dress of the Person who spoke which shewed her to be a Female with a Man lying by her Side broad awake and as quiet as a Lamb I could not but admire his exemplary Patience and discovered by his whole Behaviour that he was then lying under the Dis∣cipline of a CurtainLecture  I was entertained in many other Places with this Kind of Nocturnal Eloquence but observed that most of those whom I found awake were  kept so either by Envy or by Love Some of these were sighing and others cursing in Soliloquy some hugged their Pillows and others gnashed their Teeth  The Covetous I likewise found to be a very wakeful People I happened to come into a Room where one of them lay sick His Phy∣sician and his Wife were in close Whisper near his Bedside I overheard the Doctor say to the poor Gentlewoman he cannot possibly live till Five in the Morning She received it like the Mistress of a Family prepared for all Events At the same Instant came in a Servant Maid who said  Madam The Undertaker is below according to your Order  The Words were scarce out of her Mouth when the sick Man cried out with a fee∣ble Voice Pray Doctor how went BankStock to Day at  'Change  This melancholy Object made me too serious for diverting my self fur∣ther this Way But as I was going Home I saw a Light in a Garret and entering into it heard a Voice crying  And Hand Stand Band Fann'd Tann'd  I concluded him by this and the Furni∣ture of his Room to be a Lunatick but upon li∣stening a little longer perceived it was a Poet writing an Heroick upon the ensuing Peace  It was now towards Morning an Hour when Spirits Witches and Conjurers are obliged to re∣tire to their own Apartments and feeling the In∣fluence of it I was hastening Home when I saw a Man had got half Way into a Neighbour's House I immediately called to him and turn∣ing my Ring appeared in my proper Person There is something Magisterial in the Aspect of the  Bickerstaffs  which made him run away in Confusion  As I took a Turn or Two in my own Lodging I was thinking that old as I was I need not go to Bed alone but that it was in my Power to marry the finest Lady in this Kingdom if I  would wed her with this Ring For what a Figure would she that should have it make a Visit with so perfect a Knowledge as this would give her of all the Scandal in the Town But instead of en∣deavouring to dispose of my self and it in Matri∣mony I resolved to lend it to my loving Friend the Author of the  Atalantis  to furnish a new  Secret History  of  Secret Memoirs  The TATLER N  o    Quid voveat dulci Nutricula majus Alumno  Quam sapere fari ut possit que sentiat  Hor  From  Saturd Octob  to  Tuesd Octob    Will's Coffeehouse  Octob  IT is no easy Matter when People are advancing in any Thing to prevent their going too fast for want of Patience This happens in nothing more frequently than in the Prosecution of Stu∣dies Hence it is that we meet Crowds who attempt to be eloquent before they can speak They affect the Flowers of Rhetorick before they understand the Parts of Speech In the or∣dinary Conversation of this Town there are so many who can as they call it talk well that there is not One in Twenty that talks to be un∣derstood This proceeds from an Ambition to excel or as the Term is to shine in Company The Matter is not to make themselves under∣stood but admired They come together with a certain Emulation rather than Benevolence When you fall among such Companions the safe Way is to give your self up and let the Orators declaim for your Esteem and trouble your self  no further It is said that a Poet must be born so but I think it may be much better said of an Orator especially when we talk of our TownPoets and Orators but the TownPoets are full of Rules and Laws the TownOrators go thro' thick and thin and are forsooth Persons of such eminent natural Parts and Knowledge of the World that they despise all Men as unex∣perienced Scholasticks who wait for an Occasion before they speak or who speak no more than is necessary They had half perswaded me to go to the Tavern the other Night but that a Gentle∣man whispered me Prithee  Isaac  go with us there is  Tom Varnish  will be there and he is a Fellow that talks as well as any Man in  Eng∣land  I must confess when a Man expresses himself well upon any Occasion and his falling into an Account of any Subject arises from a Desire to oblige the Company or from Fulness of the Cir∣cumstance it self so that his speaking of it at large is occasioned only by the Openness of a Companion I say in such a Case as this it is not only pardonable but agreeable when a Man takes the Discourse to himself but when you see a Fellow watch for Opportunities for being Copious it is excessively troublesome A Man that stammers if he has Understanding is to be attended with Patience and good Nature but he that speaks more than he need has no Right to such an Indulgence The Man who has a De∣fect in his Speech takes Pains to come to you while a Man of a weak Capacity with Fluency of Speech triumphs in outrunning you The Stammerer strives to be fit for your Company the loquacious Man endeavours to show you you are not fit for his  With Thoughts of this Kind do I always enter into that Man's Company who is recommended as a Person that talks well but if I were to  chuse the People with whom I would spend my Hours of Conversation they should be certain∣ly such as laboured no farther than to make themselves readily and clearly apprehended and would have Patience and Curiosity to understand me To have good Sense and Ability to express it are the most essential and necessary Qualities in Companions When Thoughts rise in us fit to utter among familiar Friends there needs but very little Care in cloathing them  Urbanus  is I take it a Man one might live with whole Years and enjoy all the Freedom and Improvement imaginable and yet be insen∣sible of a Contradiction to you in all the Mi∣stakes you can be guilty of His great good Will to his Friends has produced in him such a general Deference in his Discourse that if he differs from you in his Sense of any Thing he introduces his own Thoughts by some agreeable Circumlocution or he has often observed such and such a Circumstance that made him of ano∣ther Opinion Again where another would be apt to say This I am confident of I may pretend to judge of this Matter as well as any Body  Urbanus  says I am verily perswaded I believe one may conclude In a Word there is no Man more clear in his Thoughts and Expressions than he is or speaks with greater Diffidence You shall hardly find one Man of any Consideration but you shall observe one of less Consequence form himself after him This happens to  Urba∣nus  but the Man who steals from him almost every Sentiment he utters in a whole Week dis∣guises the Theft by carrying it with quite a dif∣ferent Air  Umbratilis  knows  Urbanus  's doubt∣ful Way of Speaking proceeds from GoodNature and GoodBreeding and not from Uncertainty in his Opinions  Umbratilis  therefore has no more to do but repeat the Thoughts of  Urbanus  in a positive Manner and appear to the Undiscern∣ing  a wiser Man than the Person from whom he borrows But those who know him can see the Servant in his Master's Habit and the more he struts the less do his Clothes appear his own  In Conversation the Medium is neither to af∣fect Silence or Eloquence not to value our Ap∣probation and to endeavour to excel us who are of your Company are equal Inquiries The great Enemies therefore to good Company and those who transgress most against the Laws of Equali∣ty which is the Life of it are the Clown the Wit and the Pedant A Clown when he has Sense is conscious of his Want of Education and with an aukward Bluntness hopes to keep himself in Countenance by overthrowing the Use of all polite Behaviour He takes Advantage of the Restraint good Breeding lays upon others not to offend him to trespass against them and is under the Man's own Shelter while he intrudes upon him The Fellows of this Class are very frequent in the Repetition of the Words Rough and Manly When these People happen to be by their Fortunes of the Rank of Gentlemen they defend their other Absurdities by an imper∣tinent Courage and to help out the Defect of their Behaviour add their being dangerous to their being disagreeable This Gentleman though he displeases professes to do so and knowing that dares still go on to do so is not so painful a Companion as he who will please you against your Will and resolves to be a Wit  This Man upon all Occasions and whoever he falls in Company with talks in the same Circle and in the same Round of Chat which he has learned at one of the Tables of this Coffeehouse As Poetry is in it self an Elevation above ordinary and common Sentiments so there is no Fop is so very near a Madman in indifferent Company as a Poetical one He is not apprehensive that the  Generality of the World are intent upon the Bu∣siness of their own Fortune and Profession and have as little Capacity as Curiosity to enter into Matters of Ornament or Speculation I remem∣ber at a full Table in the City one of these ubi∣quitary Wits was entertaining the Company with a Soliloquy for so I call it when a Man talks to those who do not understand him con∣cerning Wit and Humour An honest Gentle∣man who sate next to me and was worth Half a Plumb stared at him and observing there was some Sense as he thought mixed with his Impertinence whispered me  Take my Word for it this Fellow is more Knave than Fool  This was all my good Friend's Applause of the wittiest Man of Talk that I was ever present at which wanted nothing to make it excellent but that there was no Occasion for it  The Pedant is so obvious to Ridicule that it would be to be one to offer to explain him He is a Gentleman so well known that there is none but those of his own Class who do not laugh at and avoid him Pedantry proceeds from much Reading and little Understanding A Pe∣dant among Men of Learning and Sense is like an ignorant Servant giving an Account of a polite Conversation You may find he has brought with him more than could have en∣tered into his Head without being there but still that he is not a Bit wiser than if he had not been there at all  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesd Octob  to

nascitur optimus ille  Qui minimis urgetur  Hor  From  Thursday Nov  to  Saturday Nov    From my own Apartment  November  WHen one considers the Turn which Con∣versation takes in almost every Set of Ac∣quaintance Club or Assembly in this Town or Kingdom one cannot but observe that in spight of what I am every Day saying and all the Mo∣ral Writers since the Beginning of the World have said the Subject of Discourse is generally upon one another's Faults This in a great Measure proceeds from SelfConceit which were to be endured in one or other individual Person but the Folly has spread it self almost over all the Species and one cannot only say  Tom Jack  or  Will  but in general  That Man is a Coxcomb  From this Source it is that any Excellence is faintly received any Imperfection unmercifully exposed But if Things were put in a true Light and we would take Time to consider that Man in his very Nature is an imperfect Being our Sense of this Matter would be immediately altered and the Word  Imperfection  would not carry an unhinder Idea than the Word  Humanity  It is a pleasant Story that we forsooth who are the only imperfect Creatures in the Universe are the only Beings that will not allow of Imperfection Some Body has taken Notice that we stand in the Middle of Existencies and are by this one Circumstance the most unhappy of all others The Brutes are guided by Instinct and know no  Sorrow the Angels have Knowledge and they are happy but Men are govern'd by Opinion which is I know not what Mixture of Instinct and Knowledge and are neither indolent nor happy It is very observable that Criticks are a People between the Learned and the Ignorant and by that Situation enjoy the Tranquility of neither As Criticks stand among Men so do Men in ge∣neral between Brutes and Angels Thus every Man as he is a Critick and a Coxcomb till im∣proved by Reason and Speculation is ever for∣getting himself and laying open the Faults of others  At the same Time that I am talking of the Cruelty of urging People's Faults with Severity I cannot but bewail some which Men are guilty of for want of Admonition These are such as they can easily mend and no Body tells them of for which Reason I shall make Use of the PennyPost as I have with Success to several young Ladies about turning their Eyes and holding up their Heads to certain Gentlemen whom I remark ha∣bitually guilty of what they may reform in a Moment There is a fat Fellow whom I have long remarked wearing his Breast open in the Midst of Winter out of an Affectation of Youth I have therefore sent him just now the following Letter in my Physical Capacity  SIR  FRom the Twentieth Instant to the First of  May  next both Days inclusive I beg of you to button your Wastcoat from your Collar to your Wastband I am  Your most humbleServant  Isaac Bickerstaff  Philomath  There is a very handsome wellshaped Youth that frequents the Coffeehouses about  CharingCross  and ties a very pretty Riband with a Cross of Jewels at his Breast This being something new and a Thing in which the Gentleman may offend the  HeraldsOffice  I have addressed my self to him as I am Censor  Dear Countryman  WAS that Ensign of Honour which you wear given you by a Prince or a Lady that you have served If you bear it as an absent Lover please to hang it on a black Riband if as a rewarded Soldier you may have my Licence to continue the red  Your Faithful Servant  Bickerstaff  Censor  These little Intimations do great Service and are very useful not only to the Persons them∣selves but to inform others how to conduct them∣selves towards them  Instead of this honest private Method or a Friendly one Face to Face of acquainting People with Things in their Power to explain or amend the usual Way among People is to take no No∣tice of Things you can help and nevertheless exposs you for those you cannot  Plumbeus  and  Levis  are constantly in each others Company They would if they took pro∣per Methods be very agreeable Companions but they so extravagantly aim at what they are unfit for and each of them rallies the other so much in the wrong Place that instead of doing each other the Offices of Friends they do but in∣struct the rest of the World to laugh at them with more Knowledge and Skill  Plumbeus  is o  a saturnine and sullen Complexion  Levis  of a mercurial and airy Disposition Both these Gen∣tlemen have but very slow Parts but would mak  a very good Figure did they pursue what they ought If  Plumbeus  would take to Business h  would in a fews Years know the Forms of Orders so well as to direct and dictate with so much Ease as to be thought a solid able and at the same Time a sure Man of Dispatch  Levis  with a little Reading and coming more into Company would soon be able to write a Song or lead up a CountryDance Instead of these proper Pur∣suits in Obedience to their respective Genius's  Plumbeus  endeavours to be the Man of Pleasure and  Levis  the Man of Business This appears in their Speech and in their Dress  Plumbeus  is ever egregiously fine and talking something like Wit  Levis  is ever extremely grave and with a silly Face repeating Maxims These Two pardon each other for affecting what each is incapable of the one to be wise and the other gay but are ex∣tremely critical in their Judgments of each other in their Way towards what they pretend to  Plumbeus  acknowledges  Levis  a Man of a great Reach because it is what  Plumbeus  never cared for being thought himself and  Levis  allows  Plumbeus  to be an agreeable Rake for the same Reason Now were these dear Friends to be free with each other as they ought to be they would change Characters and be both as commendable instead of being as ridiculous as their Capacities will admit of  Were it not too grave all that I would urge on this Subject is that Men are bewildered when they consider themselves in any other View than that of Strangers who are in a Place where it is no great Matter whether they can or unreasona∣ble to expect they should have every Thing about them as well as at their own Home This Way of Thinking is perhaps the only one that can put this Being into a proper Posture for the Ease of Society It is certain this would reduce all Faults into those which proceed from Malice or Dishonesty It would quite change our Manner of beholding one another and nothing that was  not below a Man's Nature would be below his Character The Arts of this Life would be pro∣per Advances towards the next and a very good Man would be a very fine Gentleman As it now is Humane Life is inverted and we have not learned half the Knowledge of this World before we are dropping into another Thus instead of the Raptures and Contemplations which natural∣ly attend a wellspent Life from the Approach of Eternity even we old Fellows are afraid of the Ridicule of those who are born since us and ashamed not to understand as well as peevish to resign the Mode the Fashion the Ladies the Fiddles the Balls and what not  Dick Reptile  who does not want Humour is very pleasant at our Club when he sees an old Fellow touchy at being laughed at for any Thing that is not in the Mode and bawls in his Ear  Prithee don't mind him tell him thou art mortal  The TATLER N  o    By  Jenny Distaff  HalfSister to Mr  Bickerstaff  Aedepol uae nos aeque sumus omnes invisae  Viris Propter paucas quae omnes faciunt dignae ut videa∣mur male  Ter  From  Saturd Nov  to  Tuesd Nov    From my own Apartment  November  MY Brother having written the above Piece of  Latin  desired me to take Care of the rest of the ensuing Paper Towards this he bid me answer the following Letter and said No∣thing I could write properly on the Subject of it would be disagreeable to the Motto It is the Cause of my Sex and I therefore enter upon it  with great Alacrity The Epistle is literally thus  Edenbourgh  Oct  Mr  Bickerstaff  I Presume to lay before you an Affair of mine and begs you'le be very sinceir in giving me your Judgment and Advice in this Matter which is as followes  A very agreeable young Gentleman who is endowed with all the good Quallities that can make a Man compleat has this long Time maid Love to me in the most passionat Manner that was posable He has left nothing unsaid to make me belive his Affections real and in his Letters expressed himself so hansomly and so tenderly that I had all the Reason imaginable to belive him sinceir In short he positively has promised me he would marry me But I find all he said nothing for when the Question was put to him he wouldn't but still would con∣tinue my Humble Servant and would go on at the ould Rate repeating the Assurences of his Fidelity and at the same Time has none in him He now writs to me in the same endear∣ing Style he ust to do would have me spake to no Man but himself His Estate is in his oune Hand his Father being dead My Fortune at my oune Disposal mine being also dead and to the full answers his Estate Pray Sir be in∣geinous and tell me cordially if you don't think I shall do my self an Injurey if I keep Company or a Corospondance any longer with this Gentleman I hope you'le faver an honest  North Briton  as I am with your Advice in this Amoure for I am resolved just to folow your Directions Sir you'le do me a sensable Plea∣sure and very great Honour if you'le pleas to insirt this poor Scrole with your Answer to it in your  Tatler  Pray fail not to give  me your Answer for on it depends the Hap∣piness of  Disconsolat  Almeira  MADAM  I Have frequently read over your Letter and am of Opinion that as lamentable as it is it is the most common of any Evil that attends our Sex I am very much troubled for the Ten∣derness you express towards your Lover but rejoice at the same Time that you can so far surmount your Inclination for him as to resolve to dismiss him when you have my Brother's Opinion for it His Sense of the Matter he de∣sired me to communicate to you Oh  Almei∣ra  The common Failing of our Sex is to value the Merit of our Lovers rather from the Grace of their Address than the Sincerity of their Hearts  He has expressed himself so handsomely  Can you say that after you have Reason to doubt his Truth It is a very melancholy Thing that in this Circumstance of Love which is the most important of all others in Female Life we Women who are they say always weak are still weakest The true Way of va∣luing a Man is to consider his Reputation among the Men For Want of this necessary Rule towards her Conduct when it is too late we find our selves married to the Outcasts of that Sex and it is generally from being dis∣agreeable among Men that Fellows endeavour to make themselves pleasing to us The little Accomplishments of coming into a Room with a good Air and telling while they are with us what we cannot hear among our selves usually make up the whole of a Woman's Man's Merit But if we when we began to reflect upon our Lover in the first Place considered what Figures they make in the Camp at the Bar on the  'Change  in their Country or at Court we should  behold them in quite another View than at pre∣sent  Were we to behave our selves according to this Rule we should not have the just Imputa∣tion of favouring the silliest of Mortals to the great Scandal of the wisest who value our Fa∣vour as it advances their Pleasure not their Reputation In a Word Madam if you would judge aright in Love you must look upon it as in a Case of Friendship Were this Gentleman treating with you for any Thing but your self when you had consented to his Offer if he fell off you would call him a Cheat and an Impostor There is therefore nothing left for you to do but to despise him and your self for doing with Re∣gret  I am MADAM  c  I have heard it often argued in Conversation that this Evil Practice is owing to the perverted Tast of the Wits in the last Generation A Li∣bertine on the Throne could very easily make the Language and the Fashion turn his own Way Hence it is that Woman is treated as a Mistress and not a Wife It is from the Writings of those Times and the traditional Accounts of the De∣bauches of their Men of Pleasure that the Cox∣combs nowadays take upon them forsooth to be false Swains and perjured Lovers Methinks I feel all the Woman rise in me when I reflect upon the nauseous Rogues that pretend to deceive us Wretches that can never have it in their Power to overreach any Thing living but their Mistresses In the Name of Goodness if we are designed by Nature as suitable Companions to the other Sex Why are we not treated accordingly If we have Merit as some allow Why is it not as base in Men to injure us as one another If we are the Insignificants that others call us Where is  the Triumph in deceiving us But when I look at the Bottom of this Disaster and recollect the many of my Acquaintance whom I have known in the same Condition with the  Northern Lass  that occasions this Discourse I must own I have ever found the Perfidiousness of Men has been ge∣nerally owing to ourselves and we have contri∣buted to our own Deceit The Truth is we do not conduct our selves as we are courted but as we are inclined When we let our Imaginations take this unbridled Swing it is not he that acts best is most lovely but he that is most lovely acts best When our humble Servants make their Ad∣dresses we do not keep our selves enough disinga∣ged to be Judges of their Merit and we seldom give our Judgment of our Lover till we have lost our Judgment of him  While  Clarinda  was passionately attended and addressed to by  Strephon  who is a Man of Sense and Knowledge in the World and  Cassio  who has a plentiful Fortune and an excellent Understand∣ing she fell in Love with  Damon  at a Ball From that Moment she that was before the most rea∣sonable Creature of all my Acquaintance cannot hear  Strephon  speak but it is something so out  of the Way of Ladies Conversation  And  Cassio  has ne∣ver since opened his Mouth before us but she whispers me  How seldom do Riches and Sense go together  The Issue of all this is that for the Love of  Damon  who has neither Experience Understanding or Wealth she despises those Ad∣vantages in the other Two which she finds want∣ing in her Lover or else thinks he has them for no Reason but because he is her Lover This and many other Instances may be given in this Town but I hope thus much may suffice to prevent the Growth of such Evils at  Edinburgh  The TATLER N  o    By  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Media sese tulit obvia Silva  Virginis Os Habitumque gerens  Virg  From  Tuesday Nov  to  Thursday Nov    From my own Apartment  November  IT may perhaps appear ridiculous but I must confess this last Summer as I was riding in  Enfield Chase  I met a young Lady whom I could hardly get out of my Head and for ought I know my Heart ever since She was mounted on a Pad with a very wellfancied Furniture She sate her Horse with a very graceful Air and when I saluted her with my Hat she bowed to me so obligingly that whether it was her Civility or Beauty that touched me so much I know not but I am sure I shall never forget her She dwells in my Imagination in a Figure so much to her Advantage that if I were to draw a Picture of Youth Health Beauty or Modesty I should re∣present any or all of them in the Person of that young Woman  I do not find that there are any Descriptions in the ancient Poets so beautiful as those they draw of Nymphs in their Pastoral Dresses and Exercises  Virgil  gives  Venus  the Habit of a  Spartan  Hun∣tress when she is to put  Aeneas  in his Way and relieve his Cares with the most agreeable Object imaginable  Diana  and her Train are always described as Inhabitants of the Woods and Fol∣lowers of the Chase To be well diverted is the safest Guard to Innocence and methinks it  should be one of the first Things to be regarded among People of Condition to find out proper Amusements for young Ladies I cannot but think this of Riding might easily be revived a∣mong them when they consider how much it must contribute to their Beauty This would lay up the best Portion they could bring into a Fami∣ly a good Stock of Health to transmit to their Posterity Such a charming Bloom as this gives the Countenance is very much preferable to the real or affected Feebleness or Softness which ap∣pear in the Faces of our modern Beauties  The Comedy called  The Ladies Cure  repre∣sents the Affectation of wan Looks and languid Glances to a very entertaining Extravagance There is as the Lady in the Play complains something so robust in perfect Health that it is with her a Point of Breeding and Delicacy to ap∣pear in publick with a sickly Air But the natu∣ral Gaiety and Spirit which shine in the Com∣plexion of such as form to themselves a Sort of diverting Industry by chusing Recreations that are Exercises surpass all the false Ornaments and Graces that can be put on by applying the whole Dispensary of a Toilet An healthy Body and a chearful Mind give Charms as irresistible as ini∣mitable The Beauteous  Dictynna  who came to Town last Week has from the constant Prospect in a delicious Country and the moderate Exer∣cise and Journeys in the Visits she made round it contracted a certain Life in her Countenance which will in vain employ both the Painters and Poets to represent The becoming Negligence in her Dress the severe Sweetness of her Looks and a certain innocent Boldness in all her Behaviour are the Effect of the active Recreations I am talk∣ing of  But instead of such or any other as innocent and pleasing Method of passing away their Time with Alacrity we have many in Town who  spend their Hours in an indolent State of Body and Mind without either Recreations or Re∣flections I am apt to believe there are some Pa∣rents imagine their Daughters will be accomplish∣ed enough if nothing interrupts their Growth or their Shape According to this Method of Education I could name you Twenty Families where all the Girls hear of in this Life is That it is Time to rise and to come to Dinner as if they were so insignificant as to be wholly pro∣vided for when they are fed and cloathed  It is with great Indignation that I see such Crowds of the Female World lost to humane So∣ciety and condemned to a Laziness which makes Life pass away with less Relish than in the hard∣est Labour  Palestris  in her DrawingRoom is supported by Spirits to keep off the Returns of Spleen and Melancholy before she can get over half the Day for want of something to do while the Wench in the Kitchen sings and scowrs from Morning to Night  The next disagreeable Thing to a lazy Lady is a very busy one A Man of Business in good Company who gives an Account of his Abilities and Dispatches is hardly more insupportable than her they call a Notable Woman and a Ma∣nager Lady  Goodday  where I visited the other Day at a very polite Circle entertained a great Lady with a  Recipe  for a Poultice and gave us to understand that she had done extraordinary Cures since she was last in Town It seems a Countryman had wounded himself with his Sithe as he was Mowing and we were obliged to hear of her Charity her Medicine and her Humility in the harshest Tone and coursest Language ima∣ginable  What I would request in all this Prattle is that our Females would either let us have their Per∣sons or their Minds in such Perfection as Nature designed them  The Way to this is that those who are in the Quality of Gentlewomen should propose to them∣selves some suitable Method of passing away their Time This would furnish them with Reflections and Sentiments proper for the Companions of reasonable Men and prevent the unnatural Mar∣riages which happen every Day between the most accomplished Women and the veriest Oafs the worthiest Men and the most insignificant Females Were the general Turn of Womens Education of another Kind than it is at present we should want one another for more Reasons than we do as the World now goes The common Design of Pa∣rents is to get their Girls off as well as they can and make no Conscience of putting into our Hands a Bargain for our whole Life which will make our Hearts ake every Day of it  I shall therefore take this Matter into serious Consideration and will propose for the better Improvement of the Fair Sex a  Female Library  This Collection of Books shall consist of such Authors as do not corrupt while they divert but shall tend more immediately to improve them as they are Women They shall be such as shall not hurt a Feature by the Austerity of their Reflections nor cause one impertinent Glance by the Wanton∣ness of them They shall all tend to advance the Value of their Innocence as Virgins improve their Understanding as Wives and regulate their Ten∣derness as Parents It has been very often said in these Lucubrations that the Ideas which most frequently pass through our Imaginations leave Traces of themselves in our Countenances There shall be a strict Regard had to this in my Female Library which shall be furnished with nothing that shall give Supplies to Ostentation or Imper∣tinence but the whole shall be so digested for the Use of my Students that they shall not go out of Character in their Enquiries but their Knowledge appear only a cultivated Innocence  The TATLER N  o    Per varios Casus per tot Discrimina Rerum  Tendimus  Virg  From  Thursday Nov  to  Saturday Nov    From my own Apartment  November  I Was last Night visited by a Friend of mine who has an inexhaustible Fund of Discourse and never fails to entertain his Company with a Variety of Thoughts and Hints that are altogether new and uncommon Whether it were in Com∣plaisance to my Way of Living or his real Opi∣nion he advanced the following Paradox That it required much greater Talents to fill up and become a retired Life than a Life of Business Upon this Occasion he rallied very agreeably the busie Men of the Age who only valued them∣selves of being in Motion and passing through a Series of trifling and insignificant Actions In the Heat of his Discourse seeing a Piece of Money lying on my Table I defie says he any of these active Persons to produce half the Adventures that this TwelvepennyPiece has been engaged in were it possible for him to give us an Account of his Life  My Friend's Talk made so odd an Impression upon my Mind that soon after I was aBed I fell insensibly into a most unaccountable  Resverie  that had neither Moral nor Design in it and can∣not be so properly called a Dream as a Delirium  Methoughts the Shilling that lay upon the Ta∣ble reared it self upon its Edge and turning the Face towards me opened its Mouth and in a soft  Silver Sound gave me the following Account of his Life and Adventures  I was born says he on the Side of a Mountain near a little Village of  Peru  and made a Voyage to  England  in an Ingot under the Convoy of Sir  Francis Drake  I was soon after my Arri∣val taken out of my  Indian  Habit refined na∣turalized and put into the  British  Mode with the Face of Queen  Elizabeth  on one Side and the Arms of the Country on the other Being thus equipped I found in me a wonderful Inclination to ramble and visit all the Parts of the new World into which I was brought The People very much favoured my natural Disposition and shifted me so fast from Hand to Hand that before I was Five Years old I had travelled into almost every Corner of the Nation But in the Begin∣ning of my Sixth Year to my unspeakable Grief I fell into the Hands of a miserable old Fellow who clapped me into an Iron Chest where I found Five Hundred more of my own Quality who lay under the same Confinement The only Relief we had was to be taken out and counted over in the fresh Air every Morning and Evening After an Imprisonment of several Years we heard some Body knocking at our Chest and breaking it open with an Hammer This we found was the old Man's Heir who as his Father lay a dy∣ing was so good as to come to our Release He separated us that very Day What was the Fate of my Companions I know not As for my self I was sent to the Apothecary's Shop for a Pint of Sack The Apothecary gave me to an HerbWo∣man the HerbWoman to a Butcher the Butcher to a Brewer and the Brewer to his Wife who made a Present of me to a Nonconformist Prea∣cher After this Manner I made my Way merri∣ly through the World for as I told you before we Shillings love nothing so much as travelling I sometimes fetched in a Shoulder of Mutton  sometimes a PlayBook and often had the Satis∣faction to treat a Templer at a Twelvepenny Or∣dinary or carry him with Three Friends to  West∣minsterHall  In the Midst of this pleasant Progress which I made from Place to Place I was arrested by a su∣perstitious old Woman who shut me up in a greazy Purse in Pursuance of a foolish Saying That while she kept a Queen  Elizabeth  's Shilling about her she should never be without Money I continued here a close Prisoner for many Months till at last I was exchanged for Eight and Forty Farthings  I thus rambled from Pocket to Pocket till the Beginning of the Civil Wars when to my Shame be it spoken I was employed in raising Soldiers against the King For being of a very tempting Breadth a Serjeant made Use of me to inveigle Country Fellows and list them in the Service of the Parliament  As soon as he had made one Man sure his Way was to oblige him to take a Shilling of a more homely Figure and then practise the same Trick upon another Thus I continued doing great Mischief to the Crown till my Officer chancing one Morning to walk Abroad earlier than ordina∣ry sacrificed me to his Pleasures and made Use of me to seduce a MilkMaid This Wench bent me and gave me to her Sweetheart applying more properly than she intended the usual Form of  To my Love and from my Love  This unge∣nerous Gallant marrying her within few Days after pawned me for a Dram of Brandy and drinking me out next Day I was beaten flat with an Hammer and again set a running  After many Adventures which it would be te∣dious to relate I was sent to a young Spendthrift in Company with the Will of his deceased Fa∣ther The young Fellow who I found was very extravagant gave great Demonstrations of Joy at  the Receiving the Will but opening it he found himself disinherited and cut off from the Posses∣sion of a fair Estate by Vertue of my being made a Present to him This put him into such a Pas∣sion that after having taken me in his Hand and cursed me he squirred me away from him as far as he could fling me I chanced to light in an unfrequented Place under a dead Wall where I lay undiscovered and useless during the Usurpa∣tion of  Oliver Cromwell  About a Year after the King's Return a poor Cavalier that was walking there about Dinner∣time fortunately cast his Eye upon me and to the great Joy of us both carried me to a Cook'sShop where he dined upon me and drank the King's Health When I came again into the World I found that I had been happier in my Retirement than I thought having probably by that Means escaped wearing a monstrous Pair of Breeches  Being now of great Credit and Antiquity I was rather looked upon as a Medal than an ordi∣nary Coin for which Reason a Gamester laid hold of me and converted me into a Counter ha∣ving got together some Dozens of us for that Use We led a melancholy Life in his Possession being busy at those Hours wherein Current Coin is at rest and partaking the Fate of our Master being in a few Moments valued at a Crown a Pound or a Sixpence according to the Situation in which the Fortune of the Cards placed us I had at length the good Luck to see my Master break by which Means I was again sent Abroad under my primitive Denomination of a Shil∣ling  I shall pass over many other Accidents of less Moment and hasten to that fatal Catastrophe when I fell into the Hands of an Artist who con∣veyed me under Ground and with an unmerciful Pair of Sheers cut off my Titles clipped my  Brims retrenched my Shape rubbed me to my inmost Ring and in short so spoiled and pillaged me that he did not leave me worth a Groat You may think what a Confusion I was in to see my self thus curtailed and disfigured I should have been ashamed to have shown my Head had not all my old Acquaintance been reduced to the same shameful Figure excepting some few that were punched through the Belly In the midst of this general Calamity when every Body thought our Misfortune irretrievable and our Case desperate we were thrown into the Furnace together and as it often happens with Cities ri∣sing out of a Fire appeared with greater Beauty and Lustre than we could ever boast of before What has happened to me since this Change of Sex which you now see I shall take some other Opportunity to relate In the mean Time I shall only repeat Two Adventures as being very ex∣traordinary and neither of them having ever happened to me above once in my Life The First was my being in a Poet's Pocket who was so taken with the Brightness and Novelty of my Appearance that it gave Occasion to the finest Burlesque Poem in the  British  Language entitu∣ed from me  The Splendid Shilling  The Second Adventure which I must not omit happened to me in the Year when I was given away in Charity to a blind Man but indeed this was by  Mistake the Person who gave me having heed∣  esly thrown me into the Hat among a Penny∣  orth of Farthings  The TATLER N  o    Scis etenim Justum gemina suspendere Lance  Ancipitis Librae  Pers  From  Saturd Nov  to  Tuesd Nov    From my own Apartment  Nov  I Last Winter erected a Court of Justice for the correcting of several Enormities in Dress and Behaviour which are not cognizable in any other Courts of this Realm The Vintner's Case which I there tryed is still fresh in every Man's Memo∣ry That of the Petticoat gave also a general Satisfaction not to mention the more important Points of the Cane and Perspective in which if I did not give Judgments and Decrees according to the strictest Rules of Equity and Justice I can safely say I acted according to the best of my Understanding But as for the Proceedings of that Court I shall refer my Reader to an Ac∣count of them written by my Secretary which is now in the Press and will shortly be published under the Title of  Lillie  's  Reports  As I last Year presided over a Court of Justice it is my intention this Year to set my self at the Head of a Court of Honour There is no Court o  this Nature any where at present except in  France  where according to the best of my in∣telligence it consists of such only as are Marshals of that Kingdom I am likewise informed that there is not one of that honourable Board at pre∣sent who has not been driven out of the Field by the Duke of  Marlborough  But whether this be only an accidental or a necessary Qualification I must confess I am not able to determine  As for the Court of Honour of which I am here speaking I intend to sit my self in it as Pre∣sident with several Men of Honour on my Right Hand and Women of Virtue on my Left as my Assistants The First Place of the Bench I have given to an old  Tangereen  Captain with a Wooden Leg The Second is a Gentleman of a long twisted Periwig without a Curl in it a Muff with very little Hair upon it and a Threadbare Coat with new Buttons being a Person of great Worth and Second Brother to a Man of Quali∣ty The Third is a GentlemanUsher extreamly well read in Romances and Grandson to one of the greatest Wits in  Germany  who was some Time Master of the Ceremonies to the Duke of  Wolfembuttel  As for those who sit further on my Right Hand as it is usual in publick Courts they are such as will fill up the Number of Faces up∣on the Bench and serve rather for Ornament than Use  The chief upon my Left Hand are an old Mai∣den Lady that preserves some of the best Blood of  England  in her Veins  A  Welsh  Woman of a little Stature but high Spirit  An old Prude that has censured every Marriage for these Thirty Years and is lately wedded to a young Rake  Having thus furnished my Bench I shall esta∣blish Correspondencies with the HorseGuards and the Veterans of  Chelsea College  the former to furnish me with Twelve Men of Honour as often as I shall have Occasion for a Grand Jury and the latter with as many good Men and true for a Petty Jury  As for the Women of Virtue it will not be difficult for me to find them about Midnight at Crimp and Basset  Having given this publick Notice of my Court I must further add that I intend to open it on this Day Sevennight being  Monday  the Twen∣tieth Instant and do hereby invite all such as have suffered Injuries and Astronts that are not to be redressed by the common Laws of this Land whether they be short Bows cold Saluta∣tions supercilious Looks unreturned Smiles di∣stant Behaviour or forced Familiarity as also all such as have been aggrieved by any ambiguous Expression accidental Justle or unkind Repartee likewise all such as have been defrauded of their Right to the Wall tricked out of the upper End of the Table or have been suffered to place them∣selves in their own Wrong on the BackSeat of the Coach These and all of these I do as I above said invite to bring in their several Cases and Complaints in which they shall be relieved with all imaginable Expedition  I am very sensible that the Office I have now taken upon me will engage me in the Disquisi∣tion of many weighty Points that daily perplex the Youth of the  British  Nation and therefore I have already discussed several of them for my fu∣ture Use as How far a Man may brandish his Cane in the telling a Story without insulting his Hearer What Degree of Contradiction amounts to the Lye How a Man should resent another's staring and cocking a Hat in his Face If asking Pardon is an Attonement for treading upon ones Toes Whether a Man may put up a Box on the Ear received from a Stranger in the Dark Or Whether a Man of Honour may take a Blow of his Wife With several other Subtilties of the like Nature  For my Direction in the Duties of my Office I have furnished my self with a certain Astrologi∣cal Pair of Scales which I have contrived for this Purpose In one of them I lay the Injuries in the other the Reparations The first are repre∣sented  by little Weights made of a Metal resem∣bling Iron and the other in Gold These are not only lighter than the Weights made use of in Averdupois but also than such as are used in TroyWeight The heaviest of those that repre∣sent the Injuries amount but to a Scruple and decrease by so many Subdivisions that there are several imperceptible Weights which cannot be seen without the Help of a very fine Microscope I might acquaint my Reader that these Scales were made under the Influence of the Sun when he was in  Libra  and describe many Signatures on the Weights both of Injury and Reparation But as this would look rather to proceed from an Ostentation of my own Art than any Care for the Publick I shall pass it over in Silence  The Letter of the th Instant enquired for by another of the th came to Hand  The TATLER N  o    Quisnam igitur Liber Sapiens sibi qui Imperiosus  Quem neque Pauperies neque Mors neque Vincula terrent  Responsare Cupidinibus contemnere Honores  Fortis in seipso totus teres atque rotundus  Externi nequid valeat per laeve morari  In quem manca ruit semper Fortuna  Hor  From  Tuesd Nov  to  Thursd Nov    From my own Apartment  Nov  IT is necessary to an easy and happy Life to possess our Minds in such a Manner as to be always well satisfied with our own Reflections  The Way to this State is to measure our Actions by our own Opinion and not by that of the rest of the World The Sense of other Men ought to prevail over us in Things of less Consideration but not in Concerns where Truth and Honour are engaged When we look into the Bottom of Things what at first appears a Paradox is a plain Truth and those Professions which for Want of being duly weighed seem to proceed from a Sort of Romantick Philosophy and Ignorance of the World after a little Reflection are so reasonable that it is direct Madness to walk by any other Rules Thus to contradict our Desires and to conquer the Impulses of our Ambition if they do not fall in with what we in our inward Senti∣ments approve is so much our Interest and so absolutely necessary to our real Happiness that to contemn all the Wealth and Power in the World where they stand in Competition with a Man's Honour is rather good Sense than Greatness of Mind  Did we consider that the Mind of a Man is the Man himself we should think it the most unna∣tural Sort of SelfMurther to sacrifice the Senti∣ment of the Soul to gratify the Appetites of the Body Bless us Is it possible that when the Necessities of Life are supplied a Man would flatter to be rich or circumvent to be powerful When we meet a poor Wretch urged with Hun∣ger and Cold asking an Alms we are apt to think this a State we could rather starve than submit to But yet how much more despicable is his Condition who is above Necessity and yet shall resign his Reason and his Integrity to purchase Superfluities These are both abject and common Beggars but sure it is less despicable to beg a Supply to a Man's Hunger than his Vanity But Custom and general Prepossessions have so far prevailed over an unthinking World that those necessitous Creatures who cannot relish Life  without Applause Attendance and Equipage are so far from making a contemptible Figure that distressed Virtue is less esteemed than suc∣cessful Vice But if a Man's Appeal in Cases that regarded his Honour were made to his own Soul there would be a Bafis and standing Rule for our Conduct and we should always endeavour ra∣ther to be than appear honourable Mr  Collier  in his Essay on  Fortitude  has treated this Subject with great Wit and Magnanimity  What  says he  can be more honourable than to have Courage enough to execute the Commands of Reason and Con∣science to maintain the Dignity of our Nature and the Station assigned us To be Proof against Poverty Pain and Death it self I mean so far as not to do any Thing that's scandalous or sinful to avoid them To stand Adversity under all Shapes with Decency and Resolution To do this is to be great above Title and Fortune This argues the Soul of an Heavenly Extraction and is worthy the Offspring of the Deity  What a generous Ambition has this Man point∣ed to us When Men have settled in themselves a Conviction by such noble Precepts that there is nothing honourable that is not accompanied with Innocence nothing mean but what has Guilt in it I say when they have attained thus much though Poverty Pain and Death may still retain their Terrors yet Riches Pleasures and Honours will easily lose their Charms if they stand between us and our Integrity  What is here said with Allusion to Fortune and Fame may as justly be applied to Wit and Beau∣ty for these latter are as adventitious as the o∣ther and as little concern the Essence of the Soul They are all laudable in the Man who pos∣sesses them only for the just Application of them A bright Imagination while it is subservient to an honest and noble Soul is a Faculty which makes a Man justly admired by Mankind and  furnishes him with Reflections upon his own Actions which add Delicates to the Feast of a good Conscience But when Wit descends to wait upon sensual Pleasures or promote the base Purposes of Ambition it is then to be contemned in Proportion to its Excellence If a Man will not resolve to place the Foundation of his Happi∣ness in his own Mind Life is a bewildered and unhappy State incapable of Rest or Tranquillity For to such a one the general Applause of Valour Wit nay of Honesty it self can give him but a very feeble Comfort since it is capable of being interrupted by any one who wants either Under∣standing or Goodnature to see or acknowledge such Excellencies This Rule is so necessary that one may very safely say it is impossible to know any true Relish of our Being without it Look about you in common Life among the ordinary Race of Mankind and you will find Merit in every Kind is allowed only to those who are in particular Districts or Sets of Company But since Men can have little Pleasure in these Facul∣ties which denominate them Persons of Distin∣ction let them give up such an empty Pursuit and think nothing essential to Happiness but what is in their own Power the Capacity of reflecting with Pleasure on their own Actions however they are interpreted  It is so evident a Truth that it is only in our own Bosoms we are to search for any Thing to make us happy that it is methinks a Dis∣grace to our Nature to talk of the taking our Measures from thence only as a Matter of For∣titude When all is well there the Vicissitudes and Distinctions of Life are the meer Scenes of a Drama and he will never act his Part well who has his Thoughts more fixed upon the Applause of the Audience than the Design of his Part  The Life of a Man who acts with a steady Inte∣grity without valuing the Interpretation of his Actions has but one uniform regular Path to move in where he cannot meet Opposition or fear Am∣buscade On the other Side the least Deviation from the Rules of Honour introduces a Train of numberless Evils and involves him in inexplica∣ble Mazes He that has entred into Guilt has bid Adieu to Rest and every Criminal has his Share of the Misery expressed so emphatically in the Tra∣gedian  Mackbeth shall sleep no more  It was with Detestation of any other Grandeur but the calm Command of his own Passion that the excellent Mr  Cowley  cries out with so much Justice  If e're Ambition did my Fancy cheat  With any Thought so mean as to be great  Continue Heav'n still from me to remove  The humble Blessings of that Life I love  The TATLER N  o    Narratur prisci Catonis  Saepe Mero caluisse Virtus  Hor  From  Thursd Nov  to  Saturd Nov    From my own Apartment  Nov  THE following Letter and several others to the same Purpose accuse me of a Rigour of which I am far from being guilty to wit the disallowing the chearful Use of Wine  From my Countryhouse  Oct  Mr  Bickerstaff  YOur Discourse against Drinking in  Tuesday's Tatler  I like well enough in the main but in my humble Opinion you are become too ri∣gid where you say to this Effect Were there only this single Consideration that we are the less Masters of our selves if we drink the least Proportion beyond the Exigence of Thirst I hope no one drinks Wine to allay this Appetite This seems to be designed for a loftier Indulgence of Nature for it were hard to suppose that the Author of Nature who imposed upon her her Necessities and Pains does not allow her her Pleasures and we may reckon among the latter the moderate Use of the Grape And though I am as much against Excess or whatever ap∣proaches it as your self yet I conceive one may safely go farther than the Bounds you there pre∣scribe not only without forfeiting the Title of being one's own Master but also to possess it in a much greater Degree If a Man's expressing himself upon any Subject with more Life and Vivacity more Variety of Idea's more copious∣ly more fluently and more to the Purpose ar∣gues it he thinks clearer speaks more ready and with greater Choice of comprehensive and significant Terms I have the good Fortune now to be intimate with a Gentleman remark∣able for this Temper who has an inexhaustible Source of Wit to entertain the Curious the Grave the Humorous and the Frolick He can transform himself into different Shapes and a∣dapt himself to every Company yet in a Cof∣feehouse or in the ordinary Course of Affairs appears rather dull than sprightly You can seldom get him to the Tavern but when once he is is arrived to his Pint and begins to look a∣bout and like his Company you admire a Thou∣sand  Things in him which before lay buried Then you discover the Brightness of his Mind and the Strength of his Judgment accompanied with the most graceful Mirth In a Word by this enlivening Aid he is whatever is polite instructive and diverting What makes him still more agreeable is that he tells a Story serious or comical with as much Delicacy of Humour as  Cervantes  himself And for all this at other Times even after a long Knowledge of him you shall scarce discern in this incomparable Person a whit more than what might be ex∣pected from one of a common Capacity Doubt∣less there are Men of great Parts that are guilty of downright Bashfulness that by a strange He∣sitation and Reluctance to speak murder the fi∣nest and most elegant Thoughts and render the most lively Conceptions flat and heavy  In this Case a certain Quantity of my White or Red Cordial which you will is an easie but an infallible Remedy It awakens the Judgment quickens Memory ripens Understanding dis∣perses Melancholy chears the Heart in a Word restores the whole Man to himself and his Friends without the least Pain or Indisposi∣tion to the Patient To be taken only in the Evening in a reasonable Quantity before going to Bed  Note  My Bottles are sealed with Three FlowerdeLuces and a Bunch of Grapes Be∣ware of Counterfeits I am  Your most Humble Servant  c  Whatever has been said against the Use of Wine upon the Supposition that it enfeebles the Mind and renders it unfit for the Duties of Life bears forcibly to the Advantage of that delicious Juice in Cases where it only heightens Conversation and brings to Light agreeable Talents which otherwise would have lain concealed under the  Oppression of an unjust Modesty I must acknow∣ledge I have seen many of the Temper mentioned by this Correspondent and own Wine may very allowably be used in a Degree above the Supply of meer Necessity by such as labour under Melan∣choly or are Tonguety'd by Modesty It is cer∣tainly a very agreeable Change when we see a Glass raise a lifeless Conversation into all the Pleasures of Wit and good Humour But when  Caska  adds to his natural Impudence the Fluster of a Bottle that which Fools called Fire when he was sober all Men abhor as Outrage when he is drunk Thus he that in the Morning was only saucy is in the Evening tumultuous It makes one sick to hear one of these Fellows say They love a Friend and a Bottle Noisy Mirth has something too rustick in it to be considered with∣out Terror by Men of Politeness But while the Discourse improves in a well chosen Company from the Addition of Spirits which flow from moderate Cups it must be acknowledged that Leisure Time cannot be more agreeably or per∣haps more usefully employed than at such Meet∣ings But there is a certain Prudence in this and all other Circumstances which makes Right or Wrong in the Conduct of ordinary Life Sir  Jeof∣frey Wildacre  has nothing so much at Heart as that his Son should know the World betimes For this End he introduces him among the Sots of his own Age where the Boy learns to laugh at his Father from the Familiarity with which he sees him treated by his Equals This the old Fellow calls Living well with his Heir and teaching him to be too much his Friend to be impatient for his Estate But for the more exact Regulation of Society in this and other Matters I shall publish Tables of the Characters and Relations among Men and by them instruct the Town in making Sets and Companies for a Bottle This Humour  of Sir  Jeoffrey  shall be taken Notice of in the first Place for there is methinks a Sort of Incest in Drunkenness and Sons are not to behold Fathers stripped of all Reverence  It is shocking in Nature for the Young to see those whom they should have an Awe for in Cir∣cumstances of Contempt I shall therefore utter∣ly forbid that those in whom Nature should ad∣monish to avoid too gross Familiarities shall be received in Parties of Pleasure where there is the least Danger of Excess I should run through the whole Doctrine of Drinking but that my Thoughts are at present too much employed in the Model∣ling  my Court of Honour  and altering the Seats Benches Bar and Canopy from that of the Court wherein I last Winter sate upon Causes of less Mo∣ment By the Way I shall take an Opportunity to examine what Method is to be taken to make Joiners and other Artificers get out of a House they have once entered not forgetting to tie them under proper Regulations It is for Want of such Rules that I have a Day or two longer than I expected been tormented and deafened with Ham∣mers insomuch that I neither can pursue this Discourse or answer the following and many other Letters of the highest Importance  Mr  Bickerstaff  WE are Man and Wife and have a Boy and a Girl The Lad Seventeen the Maiden Sixteen We are quarrelling about some Parts of their Education I  Ralph  cannot bear that I must pay for the Girl's Learning on the Spin∣net when I know she has no Ear I  Bridget  have not Patience to have my Son whipped be∣cause he cannot make Verses when I know he is a Blockhead Pray Sir inform us Is it ab∣solutely necessary that all who wear Breeches must be taught to Rhime all in Petticoats to touch an Instrument Please to interpose in this  and the like Cases to end much solid Distress which arises from trifling Causes as it is com∣mon in Wedlock and you will very much oblige us and ours  Ralph  Bridget  Yokefellow  The TATLER N  o    Pietate gravem ac Meritis si forte Virum quem  Conspexere silent arrectis{que} Auribus astant  Virg  From  Saturd Nov  to  Tuesd Nov    From my own Apartment  Nov  Extract of the Journal of the  Court of Honour    Die Lunae vicesimo Novembris Hora nona Ante∣meridiana  THE Court being sat an Oath prepared by the Censor was administred to the Assistants on his Right Hand who were all sworn upon their Honour The Women on his Left Hand took the same Oath upon their Reputation Twelve Gentlemen of the HorseGuards were im∣pannelled having unanimously chosen Mr  Alexan∣der Truncheon  who is their RightHand Man in the Troop for their Foreman in the Jury Mr  Truncheon  immediately drew his Sword and holding it with the Point towards his own Body presented it to the Censor Mr  Bickerstaff  recei∣ved it and after having surveyed the Breadth of the Blade and Sharpness of the Point with more  than ordinary Attention returned it to the Fore∣man in a very graceful Manner The rest of the Jury upon the Delivery of the Sword to their Foreman drew all of them together as one Man and saluted the Bench with such an Air as signi∣fied the most resigned Submission to those who commanded them and the greatest Magnanimity to execute what they should command  Mr  Bickerstaff  after having received the Com∣pliments on his Right Hand cast his Eye upon the Left where the whole Female Jury paid their Respects by a low Courtesie and by laying their Hands upon their Mouths Their Forewoman was a professed  Platonist  that had spent much of her Time in exhorting the Sex to set a just Value upon their Persons and to make the Men know them∣selves  There followed a profound Silence when at length after some Recollection the Censor who continued hitherto uncovered put on his Hat with great Dignity and after having composed the Brims of it in a Manner suitable to the Gravi∣ty of his Character he gave the following Charge which was received with Silence and Attention that being the only Applause which he admits of or is ever given in his Presence  The Nature of my Office and the Solemnity of this Occasion requiring that I should open my First Session with a Speech I shall cast what I have to say under Two principal Heads  Under the First I shall endeavour to show the Necessity and Usefulness of this newerected Court and under the Second I shall give a Word of Advice and Instruction to every constituent Part of it  As for the First it is well observed by  Phaedrus  an Heathen Poet  Nisi utile est quod facimus frustra est Gloria  Which is the same Ladies as if I should say  It would be of no Reputation for me to be President of a Court which is of no Benefit to the Publick  Now the Advantages that may arise to the WealPublick from this Institution will more plainly appear if we consider what it suffers for the Want of it Are not our Streets daily filled with wild Pieces of Justice and random Penalties Are not Crimes undetermined and Reparations disproportioned How often have we seen the Lye punished by Death and the Lyar himself deciding his own Cause nay not only acting the Judge but the Excutioner Have we not known a Box on the Ear more se∣verely accounted for than Manslaughter In these Extrajudicial Proceedings of Mankind an unmannerly Jest is frequently as Capital as a premeditated Murder  But the most pernicious Circumstance in this Case is that the Man who suffers the Injury must put himself upon the same Foot of Danger with him that gave it before he can have his just Revenge so that the Punishment is altoge∣ther accidental and may fall as well upon the Innocent as the Guilty  I shall only mention a Case which happens frequently among the more polite Nations of the World and which I the rather mention be∣cause both Sexes are concerned in it and which therefore you Gentlemen and you Ladies of the Jury will the rather take Notice of I mean that great and known Case of Cuckoldom Supposing the Person who has suffered Insults in his dearer and betterHalf supposing I say this Person should resent the Injuries done to his tender Wife What is the Reparation he may expect Why to be used worse than his poor Lady run through the Body and left  Breathless upon the Bed of Honour What then will you on my Right Hand say must the Man do that is affronted Must our Sides be elbow∣ed our Shins broken Must the Wall or per∣haps our Mistress be taken from us May a Man knit his Forhead into a Frown toss up his Arm on pish at what we say and must the Villain live after it Is there no Redress for injured Honour Yes Gentlemen that is the Design of the Judicature we have here esta∣blished  A Court of Conscience we very well know was first instituted for the determining of se∣veral Points of Property that were too little and trivial for the Cognizance of higher Courts of Justice In the same Manner our Court of Ho∣nour is appointed for the Examination of seve∣ral Niceties and Punctilio's that do not pass for Wrongs in the Eye of our common Laws But notwithstanding no Legislators of any Nation have taken into Consideration these little Cir∣cumstances they are such as often lead to Crimes big enough for their Inspection though they come before them too late for their Re∣dress  Besides I appeal to you Ladies  Here Mr  Bick∣erstaff  turned to his Left Hand  if these are not the little Stings and Thorns in Life that make it more uneasy than its most substantial Evils Confess ingenuously Did you never lose a Morn∣ning's Devotions because you could not offer them up from the highest Place of the Pew Have you not been in Pain even at a Ball because ano∣ther has been taken out to dance before you Do you love any of your Friends so much as those that are below you Or have you any Favourites that walk on your Right Hand You have answered me in your Looks I ask no more  I come now to the Second Part of my Dis∣course which obliges me to address my self in particular to the respective Members of the Court in which I shall be very brief  As for you Gentlemen and Ladies my Assistants and Grand Juries I have made Choice of you on my Right Hand because I know you very jealous of your Honour and you on my Left because I know you very much concerned for the Reputation of others for which Rea∣son I expect great Exactness and Impartiality in your Verdicts and Judgments  I must in the next Place address my self to you Gentlemen of the Council You all know that I have not chosen you for your Knowledge in the litigious Parts of the Law but because you have all of you formerly fought Duels of which I have Reason to think you have repent∣ed as being now settled in the peaceable State of Benchers My Advice to you is only that in your Pleadings you are short and expressive To which End you are to banish out of your Dis∣courses all synonymous Terms and unnecessary Multiplications of Verbs and Nouns I do more∣over forbid you the Use of the Words  also  and  likewise  and must further declare That if I catch any one among you upon any Pretence whatsoever using the Particle  or  I shall inces∣santly order him to be stripped of his Gown and thrown over the Bar  This is a true Copy  Charles Lillie  N B  The Sequel of the Proceedings of this Day will be published on  Tuesday  next  The TATLER N  o    Splendidè Mendax  Hor  From  Tuesday Nov  to  Thursday Nov    From my own Apartment  Nov  THere are no Books which I more delight in than in Travels especially those that describe remote Countries and give the Writer an Oppor∣tunity of showing his Parts without incurring any Danger of being examined or contradicted Among all the Authors of this Kind our re∣nowned Countryman Sir  John Mandeville  has di∣stinguished himself by the Copiousness of his Invention and Greatness of his Genius The Second to Sir  John  I take to have been  Ferdinand Mendez Pinto  a Person of infinite Adventure and unbounded Imagination One reads the Voyages of these Two great Wits with as much Astonishment as the Travels of  Ulysses  in  Homer  or of the  Red Cross  Knight in  Spencer  All is En∣chanted Ground and Fairy Land  I have got into my Hands by great Chance se∣veral Manuscripts of these Two eminent Authors which are filled with greater Wonders than any of those they have communicated to the Publick and indeed were they not so well attested would appear altogether improbable I am apt to think the ingenious Authors did not publish them with the rest of their Works lest they should pass for Fictions and Fables A Caution not unnecessary when the Reputation of their Veracity was not yet established in the World But as this Reason has now no further Weight  I shall make the Publick a Present of these curious Pieces at such Times as I shall find my self un∣provided with other Subjects  The present Paper I intend to fill with an Ex∣tract of Sir  John  's Journal in which that learned and worthy Knight gives an Account of the Freezing and Thawing of several short Speeches which he made in the Territories of  Nova Zem∣bla  I need not inform my Reader that the Au∣thor of  Hudibras  alludes to this strange Quality in that cold Climate when speaking of abstra∣cted Notions cloathed in a visible Shape he adds that apt Simile  Like Words congeal'd in Northern Air  Not to keep my Reader any longer in Suspence the Relation put into modern Language is as fol∣lows  We were separated by a Storm in the Latitude of insomuch that only the Ship which I was in with a  Dutch  and a  French  Vessel got safe into a Creek of  Nova Zembla  We landed in order to resit our Vessels and store our selves with Provisions The Crew of each Vessel made themselves a Cabbin of Turf and Wood at some Distance from each other to fence themselves a∣gainst the Inclemencies of the Weather which was severe beyond Imagination We soon ob∣served that in talking to one another we lost se∣veral of our Words and could not hear one ano∣ther at above Two Yards Distance and that too when we sat very near the Fire After much Perplexity I found that our Words froze in the Air before they could reach the Ears of the Per∣son to whom they were spoken I was soon con∣firmed in this Conjecture when upon the Increase of the Cold the whole Company grew dumb or rather deaf for every Man was sensible as we afterwards found that he spoke as well as ever but the Sounds no sooner took Air than  they were condensed and lost It was now a miserable Spectacle to see us nodding and gaping at one another every Man talking and no Man heard One might observe a Seaman that could hail a Ship at a League distance beckoning with his Hands straining his Lungs and tearing his Throat but all in vain  Nec vox nec Verba sequuntur  We continued here Three Weeks in this dismal Plight At length upon a Turn of Wind the Air about us began to thaw Our Cabbin was immediately filled with a dry clattering Sound which I afterwards found to be the Crackling of Consonants that broke above our Heads and were often mixed with a gentle Hissing which I imputed to the Letter  S  that occurs so fre∣quently in the  English  Tongue I soon after felt a Breeze of Whispers rushing by my Ear for those being of a soft and gentle Substance im∣mediately liquefied in the warm Wind that blew across our Cabbin These were soon followed by Syllables and short Words and at length by entire Sentences that melted sooner or later as they were more or less congealed so that we now heard every Thing that had been  spoken  du∣ring the whole Three Weeks that we had been  silent  if I may use that Expression It was now very early in the Morning and yet to my Sur∣prize I heard some Body say  Sir  John  it is Mid∣night and Time for the Ship's Crew to go to Bed  This I knew to be the Pilot's Voice and upon re∣collecting my self I concluded that he had spo∣ken these Words to me some Days before though I could not hear them before the present Thaw My Reader will easily imagine how the whole Crew was amazed to hear every Man talking and see no Man opening his Mouth In the Midst of this great Surprize we were all in we heard a Volley of Oaths and Curses lasting for  a long while and uttered in a very hoarse Voice which I knew belonged to the Boatswain who was a very cholerick Fellow and had taken his Opportunity of Cursing and Swearing at me when he thought I could not hear him for I had several Times given him the Strappado on that Account as I did not fail to repeat it for these his pious Soliloquies when I got him on Ship∣board  I must not omit the Names of several Beauties in  Wapping  which were heard every now and then in the Midst of a long Sigh that accompa∣nied them as Dear  Kate  Pretty Mrs  Peggy  When shall I see my  Sue  again This betray'd several Amours which had been concealed till that Time and furnished us with a great deal of Mirth in our Return to  England  When this Confusion of Voices was pretty well over though I was afraid to offer at Speaking as fearing I should not be heard I proposed a Visit to the  Dutch  Cabbin which lay about a Mile further up into the Country My Crew were extreamly rejoiced to find they had again recovered their Hearing though every Man ut∣tered his Voice with the same Apprehensions that I had done  Et timide Verba intermissa retentat  At about half a Mile's Distance from our Cab∣bin we heard the Groanings of a Bear which at first startled us but upon Enquiry we were in∣formed by some of our Company that he was dead and now lay in Salt having been killed upon that very Spot about a Fortnight before in the Time of the Frost Not far from the same Place we were likewise entertained with some posthumous Snarls and Barkings of a Fox  We at length arrived at the little  Dutch  Settle∣ment and upon entering the Room found it filled  with Sighs that smelt of Brandy and several o∣ther unsavourly Sounds that were altogether in∣articulate My Valet who was an  Irishman  fell into so great a Rage at what he heard that he drew his Sword but not knowing where to lay the Blame he put it up again We were stun∣ned with these confused Noises but did not hear a single Word till about half an Hour after which I ascribed to the harsh and obdurate Sounds of that Language which wanted more Time than ours to melt and become audible  After having here met with a very hearty Wel∣come we went to the  French  Cabbin who to make Amends for their Three Weeks Silence were Talking and Disputing with greater Rapi∣dity and Confusion than ever I heard in an As∣sembly even of that Nation Their Language as I found upon the first Giving of the Weather sell asunder and dissolved I was here convinced of an Error into which I had before fallen for I fancied that for the Freezing of the Sound it was necessary for it to be wrapped up and as it were preserved in Breath but I found my Mi∣stake when I heard the Sound of a Kit playing a Minuet over our Heads I asked the Occasion of it upon which one of the Company told me that it would play there above a Week longer if the Thaw continued for says he finding our selves bereft of Speech we prevailed upon one of the Company who had this Musical Instru∣ment about him to play to us from Morning to Night all which Time we employed in Dan∣cing in order to dissipate our Chagrin  tuer le Temps  Here Sir  John  gives very good Philosophical Reasons why the Kit could be heard during the Frost but as they are something Prolix I pass them over in Silence and shall only observe that the honourable Author seems by his Quo∣tations to have been well versed in the ancient  Poets which perhaps raised his Fancy above th  ordinary Pitch of Historians and very muc  contributed to the Embellishment of his Wri¦ings  The TATLER N  o    Nec te tua plurima Pantheu  Labentem Pietas nec Apollinis Insula texit  Virg  From  Thursd Nov  to  Saturd Nov    From my own Apartment  Nov  To the Censor of  Great Britain  SIR  I AM at present under very great Difficulties which it is not in the Power of any one be∣sides your self to redress Whether or no you shall think it a proper Case to come before your  Court of Honour  I cannot tell but thus it is I am Chaplain to an honourable Family very regular at the Hours of Devotion and I hope of an unblameable Life but for not offer∣ing to rise at Second Course I found my Patron and his Lady very sullen and out of Humour though at first I did not know the Reason of it At length when I happened to help my self to a Jelly the Lady of the House other∣wise a devout Woman told me That it did not become a Man of my Cloth to delight in such frivolous Food But as I still continued to sit out the last Course I was Yesterday infor∣med by the Butler that his Lordship had no further Occasion for my Service All which  is humbly submitted to your Consideration by  SIR  Your most humble Servant  c  The Case of this Gentleman deserves Pity e∣specially if he loves Sweetmeats to which if I may guess by his Letter he is no Enemy In the mean Time I have often wondered at the Indecency of discarding the holiest Man from the Table as soon as the most delicious Parts of the Entertainment are served up and could never conceive a Reason for so absurd a Custom Is it because a liquorish Palate or a sweet Tooth as they call it is not consistent with the Sanctity of his Character This is but a trifling Pretence No Man of the most rigid Virtue gives Offence by any Excesses in PlumbPudding or PlumbPor∣ridge and that because they are the first Parts of the Dinner Is there any Thing that tends to Incitation in Sweetmeats more than in ordi∣nary Dishes Certainly not SugarPlumbs are a very innocent Diet and Conserves of a much colder Nature than your common Pickles I have sometimes thought that the Ceremony of the Chaplain's flying away from the Dessert was Typical and Figurative to mark out to the Com∣pany how they ought to retire from all the lus∣cious Baits of Temptation and deny their Appe∣tites the Gratifications that are most pleasing to them or at least to signify that we ought to stint our selves in our most lawful Satisfactions and not make our Pleasure but our Support the End of Eating But most certainly if such a Lesson of Temperance had been necessary at a Table our Clergy would have recommended it to all the LayMasters of Families and not have disturbed other Men's Tables with such unseason∣able Examples of Abstinence The Original  therefore of this barbarous Custom I take  have been meerly accidental The Chaplain  ¦tired out of pure Complaisance to make Roo  for the Removal of the Dishes or possibly f  the Ranging of the Dessert This by Degre  grew into a Duty till at length as the Fashio  improved the good Man found himself cut  from the third Part of the Entertainment an  if the Arrogance of the Patron goes on it is n  impossible but in the next Generation he m  see himself reduced to the Tythe or Tenth Di  of the Table a sufficient Caution not to pa  with any Privilege we are once possessed of  was usual for the Priest in old Times to feast  ¦on the Sacrifice nay the HoneyCake while th  hungry Laity looked upon him with great Devo¦tion or as the late Lord  Rochester  describes it i  a very lively Manner  And whiie the Priest did eat the People stared  At present the Custom is inverted the Lai  feast while the Priest stands by as an humbl  Spectator This necessarily puts the good Ma  upon making great Ravages on all the Dishe  that stand near him and distinguishing himsel  by Voraciousness of Appetite as knowing tha  his Time is short I would fain ask these stif  neck'd Patrons Whether they would not take  ill of a Chaplain that in his Grace after Meat should return Thanks for the whole Entertain∣ment with an Exception to the Dessert And ye  I cannot but think that in such a Proceeding  would but deal with them as they deserved  What would a Roman Catholick Priest think  who is always helped first and placed next th  Ladies should he see a Clergyman giving hi  Company the Slip at the first Appearance of th  Tarts or Sweetmeats Would not he believ  that he had the same Antipathy to a Candie  Orange or a Piece of PuffPast as some have  a  Cheshire  Cheese or a Breast of Mutton Yet to so ridiculous a Height is this foolish Custom grown that even the  Christmas  Pye which in its very Nature is a kind of consecrated Cate and a Badge of Distinction is often forbidden to the Druid of the Family Strange that a Sirloin of Beef whether boiled or roasted when entire is exposed to his utmost Depredations and Incisions but if minced into small Pieces and tossed up with Plumbs and Sugar changes its Property and forsooth is Meat for his Ma∣ster  In this Case I know not which to censure the Patron or the Chaplain the Insolence of Power or the Abjectness of Dependance For my own Part I have often blushed to see a Gentleman whom I knew to have much more Wit and Lear∣ning than my self and who was bred up with me at the University upon the same Foot of a liberal Education treated in such an ignominious Manner and sunk beneath those of his own Rank by reason of that Character which ought to bring him Honour This deters Men of ge∣nerous Minds from placing themselves in such a Station of Life and by that Means frequently excludes Persons of Quality from the improving and agreeable Conversation of a learned and ob∣sequious Friend  Mr  Oldham  lets us know That he was affright∣ed from the Thought of such an Employment by the scandalous Sort of Treatment which often accompanies it  Some think themselves exalted to the Sky  If they light in some Noble Family  Diet an Horse and Thirty Pounds a Year  Besides th' Advantage of his Lordship's Ear  The Credit of the Business and the State  Are Things that in a Youngster's Sense sound great  Little the unexperienc'd Wretch does know  What Slavery he oft must undergo  Who tho' in Silken Scarf and Cassock drest  Wears but a gayer Livery at best  When Dinner calls the Implement must wait  With holy Words to consecrate the Meat  But hold it for a Favour seldom known  If he be deign'd the Honour to sit down  Soon as the Tarts appear Sir  Crape  withdr  Those Dainties are not for a Spiritual Maw  Observe your Distance and be sure to stand  Hard by the Cistern with your Cap in Hand  There for Diversion you may pick your Teeth  Till the kind Voider comes for your Relief  Let others who such Meannesses can brook  Strike Countenance to ev'ry great Man's Look  I rate my Freedom higher  This Author's Raillery is the Raillery of a Friend and does not turn the Sacred Order into Ridicule but is a just Censure on such Person  as take Advantage from the Necessities of a M  of Merit to impose on him Hardships that a  by no Means suitable to the Dignity of his Pro∣fession  The TATLER N  o    Nostrum est tantas componere Lites  Virg  rom  Saturd Nov  to  Tuesday Nov    The Proceedings of the  Court of Honour  held in  SheerLane  on  Monday  the th of  Novem¦ber  before  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Censor of  Great Britain  PEter Plumb  of  London  Merchant was in∣dicted by the Honourable Mr  Thomas Gules  of  GuleHall  in the Country of  Salop  for that the said  Peter Plumb  did in  Lombardstreet London  between the Hours of Two and Three in the Afternoon meet the said Mr  Thomas Gules  and after a short Salutation put on his Hat Value FivePence while the Honourable Mr  Gules  stood bareheaded for the Space of Two Seconds It was further urged against the Criminal That during his Discourse with the Prosecutor he fe∣loniously stole the Wall of him having clapped his Back against it in such a Manner that it was impossible for Mr  Gules  to recover it again at his taking Leave of him The Prosecutor alledged That he was the Cadet of a very ancient Family and that according to the Principles of all the younger Brothers of the said Family he had ne∣ver sullied himself with Business but had chosen rather to starve like a Man of Honour than do any Thing beneath his Quality He produced several Witnesses that he had never employed himself beyond the Twisting of a Whip or the Making of a Pair of NutCrackers in which he  only worked for his Diversion in order to mae a Present now and then to his Friends The Pri∣soner being asked what he could say for himself cast several Reflections upon the Honourable Mr  Gules  as That he was not worth a Groat That no Body in the City would trust him for a Halspenny That he owed him Money which he had promised to pay him several Times but ne∣ver kept his Word And in short That he was an idle beggarly Fellow and of no Use to the Publick This Sort of Language was very se∣verely reprimanded by the Censor who told the Criminal That he spoke in Contempt of the Court and that he should be proceeded against for Contumacy if he did not change his Style The Prisoner therefore desired to be heard by his Council who urged in his Defence That he put on his Hat through Ignorance and took the Wall by Accident They likewise produced se∣veral Witnesses That he made several Motions with his Hat in his Hand which are generally understood as an Invitation to the Person we talk with to be covered and that the Gentleman not taking the Hint he was forced to put on his Hat as being troubled with a Cold There was likewise an  Irish  Man who deposed That he had heard him cough Three and twenty times that Morning And as for the Wall it was alledged That he had taken it inadvertently to save him∣self from a Shower of Rain which was then fal∣ling The Censor having consulted the Men of Honour who sat at his Right Hand on the Bench found they were all of Opinion That the De∣fence made by the Prisoner's Council did rather aggravate than extenuate his Crime That the Motions and Intimations of the Hat were a To∣ken of Superiority in Conversation and therefore not to be used by the Criminal to a Man of the Prosecutor's Quality who was likewise vested with a double Title to the Wall at the Time of  eir Conversation both as it was the upper  and and as it was a Shelter from the Weather The Evidence being very full and clear the  ry without going out of Court declared their Opinion unanimously by the Mouth of their Fore∣man That the Prosecutor was bound in Honour  o make the Sun shine through the Criminal or  s they afterwards explained themselves to whip  im through the Lungs  The Censor knitting his Brows into a Frown  nd looking very sternly upon the Jury after a  ittle Pause gave them to know That this Court was erected for the finding out of Penalties suita∣ble to Offences and to restrain the Outrages of private Justice and that he expected they should moderate their Verdict The Jury therefore re∣tired and being willing to comply with the Ad∣vices of the Censor after an Hour's Consulta∣tion declared their Opinion as follows  That in Consideration this was  Peter Plumb  's first Offence and that there did not appear any  Malice prepense  in it as also that he lived in good Reputation among his Neighbours and that his taking the Wall was only  se defendendo  the Pro∣secutor should let him escape with Life and content himself with the Slitting of his Nose and the Cutting off both his Ears Mr  Bicker∣staff  smiling upon the Court told them That he thought the Punishment even under its present Mitigation too severe and that such Penalties might be of ill Consequence in a Trading Na∣tion He therefore pronounced Sentence against the Criminal in the following Manner That his Hat which was the Instrument of Offence should be forfeited to the Court That the Criminal should go to the Warehouse from whence he came and thence as Occasion should require proceed to the  Exchange  or  Garraway  's Coffeehouse in what Manner he pleased but that neither he nor any of the Family of the  Plumbs  should hereafter appear in the Streets  London  out of their Coaches that so the Foo  Way might be left open and undisturbed for thei  Betters  Dathan  a Peddling  Jew  and  T R  Welshman  were indicted by the Keeper of  Alehouse in  Westminster  for breaking the Peac  and two Earthen Mugs in a Dispute about the Antiquity of their Families to the great Detri∣ment of the House and Disturbance of the whole Neighbourhood  Dathan  said for himself that he was provoked to it by the  Welshman  who pretended that the  Welsh  were an ancienter People than the  Jews  whereas says he I can shew by this Genealogy in my Hand that I am the Son of  Mesheck  that was the Son of  Naboth  that was the Son of  Shalem  that was the Son of The  Welshman  here interrupted him and told him That he could produce Shennalo∣gy as well as himself for that he was  John ap Rice ap Shenkin ap Shones  He then turned himself to the Censor and told him in the same broken Accent and with much Warmth That the  Jew  would needs uphold that King  Cadwalla∣der  was younger than  Issachar  Mr  Bickerstaff  seemed very much inclined to give Sentence a∣gainst  Dathan  as being a  Jew  but finding Rea∣sons by some Expressions which the  Welshman  let fall in asserting the Antiquity of his Family to suspect that the said  Welshman  was a  PraeAda∣mite  he suffered the Jury to go out without any previous Admonition After some Time they returned and gave their Verdict That it appearing the Persons at the Bar did neither of them wear a Sword and that consequently they had no Right to quarrel upon a Point of Ho∣nour to prevent such frivolous Appeals for the future they should both of them be tossed in the same Blanket and there adjust the Superio∣rity  as they could agree it between themselves The Censor confirmed the Verdict  Richard Newman  was indicted by Major  Punto  for having used the Words  Perhaps it may be so  in a Dispute with the said Major The Major urged That the Word  Perhaps  was questioning his Veracity and that it was an indirect Manner of giving him the Lye  Richard Newman  had nothing more to say for himself than that he in∣tended no such Thing and threw himself upon the Mercy of the Court The Jury brought in their Verdict Special  Mr  Bickerstaff  stood up and after having cast his Eyes over the whole Assembly hem'd thrice He then acquainted them That he had laid down a Rule to himself which he was resolved never to depart from and which as he conceived would very much conduce to the shortening the Business of the Court I mean says he never to allow of the Lye being given by Construction Implication or Induction but by the sole Use of the Word it self He then proceeded to show the great Mischiefs that had arisen to the  English  Nation from that pernicious Monosyllable That it had bred the most fatal Quarrels between the dearest Friends That it had frequently thin'd the Guards and made great Havock in the Ar∣my That it had sometimes weaken'd the City Trained Bands and in a Word had destroved many of the bravest Men in the Isle of  Great Britain  For the Prevention of which Evils for the future he instructed the Jury to  present  the Word it self as a Nusance in the  English  Tongue and further promised them That he would up∣on such their Presentment publish an Edict of the Court for the entire Banishment and Exclu∣sion of it out of the Discourses and Conversation of all civil Societies  This is a true Copy  Charles Lillie  Monday  next is set apart for the Tryal of several Female Causes  N B  The Case of the Hassock will

Thursday Nov    From my own Apartment  Nov  EVery Nation is distinguished by Productions that are peculiar to it  Great Britain  is par∣ticularly fruitful in Religions that shoot up and flourish in this Climate more than in any other We are so famous Abroad for our great Variety of Sects and Opinions that an ingenious Friend of mine who is lately returned from his Tra∣vels assures me there is a Show at this Time  carried  up and down in  Germany  which repre∣sents all the Religions of  Great Britain  in Wax∣work Notwithstanding that the Pliancy of the Matter in which the Images are wrought makes it capable of being moulded into all Shapes and Figures my Friend tells me that he did not think it possible for it to be twisted and tortured into so many skrew'd Faces and wry Features as appeared in several of the Figures that composed the Show I was indeed so pleased with the De∣sign of the  German  Artist that I begged my Friend to give me an Account of it in all its Par∣ticulars which he did after the following Man∣ner  I have often says he been present at a Show of Elephants Camels Dromedaries and other strange Creatures but I never saw so great an Assembly of Spectators as were met together at the Opening of this great Piece of Waxwork We were all placed in a large Hall according to the Price that we had paid for our Seats The Curtain that hung before the Show was made by a Master of Tapestry who had woven it in the Figure of a monstrous  Hydra  that had several Heads which brandished out their Tongues and seemed to hiss at each other Some of these Heads were large and entire and where any of them had been lopped away there sprouted up several in the Room of them insomuch that for one Head cut off a Man might see Ten Twen∣ty or an Hundred of a smaller Size creeping through the Wound In short the whole Picture was nothing but Confusion and Bloodshed On a sudden says my Friend I was startled with a Flourish of many Musical Instruments that I had never heard before which was followed by a short Tune if it might be so called wholly made up of Jars and Discords Among the rest there was an Organ a Bagpipe a GroaningBoard a StentorophonickTrumpet with several Wind Instruments of a most disagreeable Sound which I do not so much as know the Name of After a short Flourish the Curtain was drawn up and we were presented with the most extraordinary Assembly of Figures that ever entered into a Man's Imagination The Design of the Work∣man was so well expressed in the dumb Show before us that it was not hard for an  English∣man  to comprehend the Meaning of it  The principal Figures were placed in a Row consisting of Seven Persons The middle Figure which immediately attracted the Eyes of the whole Company and was much bigger than the rest was formed like a Matron dressed in the Habit  of an elderly Woman of Quality in Queen  Eli∣zabeth  's Days The most remarkable Parts of her Dress was the Beaver with the Steeple Crown the Scarf that was darker than Sable and the Lawn Apron that was whiter than Er∣min Her Gown was of the richest black Vel∣vet and just upon her Heart studded with large Diamonds of an inestimable Value disposed in the Form of a Cross She bore an inexpressible Chearfulness and Dignity in her Aspect and though she seemed in Years appeared with so much Spirit and Vivacity as gave her at the same Time an Air of old Age and Immortality I found my Heart touched with so much Love and Reverence at the Sight of her that the Tears ran down my Face as I looked upon her and still the more I looked upon her the more my Heart was melted with the Sentiments of Filial Tenderness and Duty I discovered every Mo∣ment something so charming in this Figure that I could scarce take my Eyes off it On its Right Hand there sat the Figure of a Woman so covered with Ornaments that her Face her Body and her Hands were almost entirely hid under them The little you could see of her Face was painted and what I thought very odd had something in it like artificial Wrinkles but I was the less surprised at it when I saw upon her Forehead an oldfashioned Tower of grey Hairs Her HeadDress rose very high by Three several Stories or Degrees her Garments had a Thousand Colours in them and were embroi∣dered with Crosses in Gold Silver and Silk She had nothing on so much as a Glove or a Slipper which was not marked with this Figure nay so superstitiously fond did she appear of it that she sat crosslegged I was quickly sick of this tawdry Composition of Ribands Silks and Jewels and therefore cast my Eye on a Dame which was just the Reverse of it I need not tell  my Reader that the Lady before described was  Popery  or that she I am now going to describe is  Presbytery  She sat on the Left Hand of the ve∣nerable Matron and so much resembled her in the Features of her Countenance that she seemed her Sister but at the same Time that one obser∣ved a Likness in her Beauty one could not but take Notice that there was something in it sickly and splenatick Her Face had enough to discover the Relation but it was drawn up into a peevish Figure sowred with Discontent and overcast with Melancholy She seemed offended at the Matron for the Shape of her Hat as too much resembling the triple Coronet of the Person who sat by her One might see likewise that she dissented from the white Apron and the Cross for which Reasons she had made her self a plain homely Dowdy and turned her Face towards the Sectaries that sat on her Left Hand as being a∣fraid of looking upon the Matron lest she should see the Harlot by her  On the Right Hand of  Popery  sat  Judaism  re∣presented by an old Man embroidered with Phy∣lacteries and distinguished by many Typical Fi∣gures which I had not Skill enough to unriddle He was placed among the Rubbish of a Temple but instead of weeping over it which I should have expected from him he was counting out a Bag of Money upon the Ruins of it  On his Right Hand was  Deism  or  Natural Re∣ligion  This was a Figure of an halfnaked auk∣ward Country Wench who with proper Orna∣ments and Education would have made an agree∣able and beautiful Appearance but for Want of those Advantages was such a Spectacle as a Man would blush to look upon  I have now continued my Friend given you an Account of those who were placed on the Right Hand of the Matron and who according to the Order in which they sat were  Deism Ju∣daism  and  Popery  On the Left Hand as I told you appeared  Presbytery  The next to her was a Figure which somewhat puzzled me It was that of a Man looking with Horror in his Eyes upon a Silver Bason filled with Water Observing something in his Countenance that looked like Lunacy I fancied at first that he was to express that kind of Distraction which the Physicians call the  HydroPhobia  but considering what the Intention of the Show was I immediately re∣collected my self and concluded it to be  Ana∣baptism  The next Figure was a Man that sat under a most profound Composure of Mind He wore an Hat whose Brims were exactly parallel with the Horizon His Garment had neither Sleeve nor Skirt nor so much as a superfluous Button What they called his Cravat was a little Piece of white Linen quilled with great Exactness and hanging below his Chin about two Inches See∣ing a Book in his Hand I asked our Artist what it was who told me it was the  Quakers  Religion upon which I desired a Sight of it Upon Peru∣sal I found it to be nothing but a newfashioned Grammar or an Art of abridging ordinary Dis∣course The Nouns were reduced to a very small Number as the  Light Friend Babylon  The principal of his Pronouns was  Thou  and as for You Ye and Yours I found they were not looked upon as Parts of Speech in this Grammar All the Verbs wanted the Second Person Plural the Participles ended all in  ing  or  ed  which were marked with a particular Accent There were no Adverbs besides  Yea  and  Nay  The same Thrift was observed in the Prepositions The Con∣junctions were only  Hem  and  Ha  and the In∣terjections brought under the Three Heads of Sighing Sobbing and Groaning  There was at the End of the Grammar a little Nomenclature call'd  The Christian Man's Voca∣bulary  which gave new Appellations or if you will Christian Names to almost every Thing in Life I replaced the Book in the Hand of the Fi∣gure not without admiring the Simplicity of its Garb Speech and Behaviour  Just opposite to this Row of Religions there was a Statue dressed in a Fool's Coat with a Cap of Bells upon his Head laughing and pointing at the Figures that stood before him This Ideot is supposed to say in his Heart what  David  's Fool did some Thousands of Years ago and was therefore designed as a proper Representative of those among us who are called Atheists and In∣fidels by others and FreeThinkers by them∣selves  There were many other Groupes of Figures which I did not know the Meaning of but see∣ing a Collection of both Sexes turning their Backs upon the Company and laying their Heads very close together I enquired after their Religion and found that they called themselves the  Philo∣delphians  or the Family of Love  In the opposite Corner there sat another little Congregation of strange Figures opening their Mouths as wide as they could gape and distin∣guished by the Title of the  Sweet Singers of Israel  I must not omit that in this Assembly of Wax there were several Pieces that moved by Clock∣work and gave great Satisfaction to the Specta∣tors Behind the Matron there stood one of these Figures and behind  Popery  another which as the Artist told us were each of them the Genius of the Person they attended That behind  Popery  represented  Persecution  and the other  Moderation  The first of these moved by secret Springs to∣wards a great Heap of dead Bodies that lay piled upon one another at a considerable Distance be∣hind the principal Figures There were written  on the Foreheads of these dead Men several ha  Words as  PraeAdamites Sabbatarians Cam  ¦nians Muggletonians Brownists Independants M  ¦sonites Camisars  and the like At the Approac  of  Persecution  it was so contrived that as sh  held up her Bloody Flag the whole Assembly of dead Men like those in the  Rehearsal  started up and drew their Swords This was followed by great Clashings and Noise when in the Midst of the Tumult the Figure of  Moderation  moved gently towards this new Army which upon her holding up a Paper in her Hand inscribed  Li∣berty of Conscience  immediately fell into a Heap of Carcasses remaining in the same quiet Posture that they lay at first  The TATLER N  o    Occidit miseros crambe repetita  Juv  From  Thursday Nov  to  Saturd Dec    From my own Apartment  December  WHen a Man keeps a constant Table he may

drop'd me a Courtesie as she went along I was surprized at all this Civility and knew not to what I might ascribe it except to my bright Beaver and shining Scarf that were new that Day But I was still

Journal of the  Court of Ho∣nour  held in  SheerLane  on  Monday  the th of  November  before  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Censor of  Great Britain  ELizabeth Makebate  of the Parish of St  Cathe∣rine  's Spinster was indicted for surrepti∣tiously taking away the Hassock from under the Lady  GraveAirs  between the Hours of Four and Five on  Sunday  the th of  November  The Pro∣secutor deposed That as she stood up to make a Courtesie to a Person of Quality in a neighbour∣ing Pew the Criminal conveyed away the Has∣sock by Stealth insomuch that the Prosecutor was obliged to fit all the while she was at Church or to say her Prayers in a Posture that did not become a Woman of her Quality The  Prisoner pleaded Inadvertency and the Jury were going to bring it in Chancemedley had not several Witnesses been produced against the said  Elizabeth Makebate  that she was an old Of∣fender and a Woman of a bad Reputation It appeared in particular That on the  Sunday  before she had detracted from a new Petticoat of Mrs  Ma∣ry Doelittle  having said in the Hearing of several credible Witnesses that the said Petticoat was scowred to the great Grief and Detriment of the said  Mary Doelittle  There were likewise many Evidences produced against the Criminal that though she never failed to come to Church on  Sunday  she was a most notorious SabbathBrea∣ker and that she spent her whole Time during Divine Service in disparaging other People's Clothes and whispering to those who sat next her Upon the whole she was found guilty of the Indictment and received Sentence to ask Pardon of the Prosecutor upon her bare Knees without either Cushion or Hassock under her in the Face of the Court  N B  As soon as the Sentence was executed on the Criminal which was done in open Court with the utmost Severity the first Lady of the Bench on Mr  Bickerstaff  's Right Hand stood up and made a Motion to the Court That whereas it was impossible for Women of Fashion to dress themselves before the Church was half done and whereas many Confusions and Inconveniencies did arise thereupon it might be lawful for them to send a Footman in order to keep their Places as was usual in other polite and well regulated Assemblies The Motion was ordered to be en∣tred in the Books and considered at a more con∣venient Time  Charles Cambrick  Linendraper in the City of  Westminster  was indicted for speaking obscenely to the Lady  Penolope Youthwood  It appeared That the Prosecutor and her Woman going in a  StageCoach from  London  to  Brentford  where they were to be met by the Lady's own Chariot the Criminal and another of his Acquaintance travelled with them in the same Coach at which Time the Prisoner talked Bawdy for the Space of Three Miles and a half The Prosecutor alledg∣ed That over against the  Old Fox  at  Knights∣bridge  he mentioned the Word Linen That at the further End of  Kensington  he made Use of the Term Smock and that before he came to  Ham∣mersmith  he talked almost a Quarter of an Hour upon WeddingShifts The Prosecutor's Woman confirmed what her Lady had said and added further That she had never seen her La∣dy in so great a Confusion and in such a Ta∣king as she was during the whole Discourse of the Criminal The Prisoner had little to say for himself but that he talked only in his own Trade and meant no Hurt by what he said The Jury however found him guilty and represented by their Forewoman That such Discourses were apt to sully the Imagination and that by a Concate∣nation of Idea's the Word Linen implied many Things that were not proper to be stirred up in the Mind of a Woman who was of the Prosecu∣tor's Quality and therefore gave it as their Ver∣dict That the Linendraper should lose his Tongue Mr  Bickerstaff  said he thought the Prosecutor's Ears were as much to blame as the Prisoner's Tongue and therefore gave Sentence as follows That they should both be placed overagainst one another in the Midst of the Court there to re∣main for the Space of one Quarter of an Hour during which Time the Linendraper was to be gagged and the Lady to hold her Hands close upon both her Ears which was executed accor∣dingly  Edward Callicoat  was indicted as an Accomplice to  Charles Cambrick  for that he the said  Edward Callicoat  did by his Silence and his Smiles seem  to approve and abet the said  Charles Cambrick  in every Thing he said It appeared That the Pri∣soner was Foreman of the Shop to the aforesaid  Charles Cambrick  and by his Post obliged to smile at every Thing that the other should be pleased to say Upon which he was acquitted  Josias Shallow  was indicted in the Name of Dame  Winifred  sole Relict of  Richard Dainty  Esq  for having said several Times in Company and in the Hearing of several Persons there present That he was extremely obliged to the Widow  Dainty  and that he should never be able suffi∣ciently to express his Gratitude The Prosecutor urged That this might blaft her Reputation and that it was in Effect a boasting of Favours which he had never received The Prisoner seemed to be much astonished at the Construction which was put upon his Words and said That he meant nothing by them but that the Widow had befriended him in a Lease and was very kind to his younger Sister The Jury finding him a little weak in his Understanding without going out of the Court brought in their Verdict  Igno∣ramus  Ursula Goodenough  was accused by the Lady  Betty Wou'dbe  for having said That she the Lady  Betty Wou'dbe  was painted The Prisoner brought several Persons of good Credit to witness to her Reputation and proved by undeniable Evidences that she was never at the Place where the Words were said to have been uttered The Censor ob∣serving the Behaviour of the Prosecutor found Reason to believe that she had indicted the Priso∣ner for no other Reason but to make her Com∣plexion be taken Notice of which indeed was very fresh and beautiful He therefore asked the Offender with a very stern Voice How she could presume to spread so groundless a Report And whether she saw any Colours in the Lady  Wou'd∣be  's Face that could procure Credit to such a  Falshood Do you see says he any Lillies or Roses in her Cheeks any Bloom any Probabili∣tyThe Prosecutor not able to bear such Language any longer told him That he talked like a blind old Fool and that she was asham'd to have entertain'd any Opinion of his Wisdom But she was soon put to Silence and sentenced to wear her Mask for Five Months and not to presume to show her Face till the Town should be empty  Benjamin Buzzard  Esq  was indicted for having told the Lady  Everbloom  at a publick Ball That she looked very well for a Woman of her Years The Prisoner not denying the Fact and persisting before the Court that he looked upon it as a Compliment the Jury brought him in  Non Com∣pos Mentis  The Court then adjourned to  Monday  the    th Instant  Copia Vera  Charles Lillie  The TATLER N  o    Non cuicunque datum est habere Nasum  Mart  From  Tuesday Dec  to  Thursday Dec    From my own Apartment  December  WE have a very learned and elaborate Dis∣sertation upon Thumbs in  Montaigne  's  Es∣says  and another upon Ears in the  Tale of a Tub  I am here going to write one upon Noses having chosen for my Text the following Verses out of  Hudibras  So learned  Talicotius  from  The brawny Part of Porter's Bum  Cut Supplemental Noses which  Lasted as long as Parent Breech  But when the Date of Nock was out  Off drop'd the Sympathetick Snout  Notwithstanding that there is nothing obscene in Natural Knowledge and that I intend to give as little Offence as may be to Readers of a well∣bred Imagination I must for my own Quiet de∣sire the Criticks who in all Times have been fa∣mous for good Noses to refrain from the Lecture of this curious Tract These Gentlemen were formerly marked out and distinguished by the little Rhinocerical Nose which was always look∣ed upon as an Instrument of Derision and which they were used to cock toss or draw up in a contemptuous Manner upon reading the Works of their ingenious Contemporaries It is not therefore for this Generation of Men that I write the present Transaction  Minus aptus acutis  Naribus horum Hominum  But for the Sake of some of my Philosophical Friends in the Royal Society who peruse Dis∣courses of this Nature with a becoming Gravity and a Desire of improving by them  Many are the Opinions of learned Men con∣cerning the Rise of that fatal Distemper which has always taken a particular Pleasure in venting its Spight upon the Nose I have seen a little Burlesque Poem in  Italian  that gives a very plea∣sant Account of this Matter The Fable of it  ns thus  Mars  the God of War having served during the Siege of  Naples  in the Shape of a  French  Colonel received a Visit one Night from  Venus  the Goddess of Love who had been al∣ways his professed Mistress and Admirer The  Poem says she came to him in the Disguise of a Suttling Wench with a Bottle of Brandy under her Arm Let that be as it will he managed Matters so well that she went away bigbellied and was at length brought to Bed of a little  Cu∣pid  This Boy whether it were by Reason of any bad Food that his Father had eaten during the Siege or of any particular Malignity in the Stars that reigned at his Nativity came into the World with a very sickly Look and crazy Constitution As soon as he was able to handle his Bow he made Discoveries of a most perverse Disposition He dipped all his Arrows in Poison that rotted every Thing they touched and what was more particular aimed all his Shafts at the Nose quite contrary to the Practice of his elder Brothers who had made a humane Heart their Burt in all Countries and Ages To break him of this Ro∣guish Trick his Parents put him to School to  Mercury  who did all he could to hinder him from demolishing the Noses of Mankind but in Spight of Education the Boy continued very unlucky and tho' his Malice was a little softened by good Instructions he would very frequently let fly an invenomed Arrow and wound his Votaries oft∣ner in the Nose than in the Heart Thus far the Fable  I need not tell my learned Reader that  Correg∣gio  has drawn a  Cupid  taking his Lesson from  Mercury  conformable to this Poem nor that the Poem it self was designed as a Burlesque upon  Fracastorius  It was a little after this fatal Siege of  Naples  that  Talicotius  begun to practise in a Town of  Germany  He was the first ClapDoctor that I meet with in History and a greater Man in his Age than our celebrated Dr  Wall  He saw his Species extremely mutilated and disfigured by this new Distemper that was crept into it and therefore in Pursuance of a very seasonable In∣ven∣tion  set up a Manufacture of Noses havin  first got a Patent that none should presume t  make Noses besides himself His first Patien  was a great Man of  Portugal  who had done goo  Services to his Country but in the Midst of the  unfortunately lost his Nose  Talicotius  grafted  new one on the remaining Part of the Gristle o  Cartilaginous Substance which would sneeze  smell take Snuff pronounce the Letters  M  or  N  and in short do all the Functions of a Genuine and Natural Nose There was however one Mis∣fortune in this Experiment The  Portuguese's  Complexion was a little upon the Subfusk with very black Eyes and dark Eyebrows and the Nose being taken from a Porter that had a white  German  Skin and cut out of those Parts that are not exposed to the Sun it was very visible that the Features of his Face were not Fellows In a Word the  Comdé  resembled one of those maimed antique Statues that has often a modern Nose of fresh Marble glewed to a Face of such a yellow Ivory Complexion as nothing can give but Age To remedy this Particular for the future the Doctor got together a great Collection of Porters Men of all Complexions black brown fair dark sallow pale and ruddy so that it was impossible for a Patient of the most outoftheway Colour not to find a Nose to match it  The Doctor's House was now very much en∣larged and become a Kind of College or rather Hospital for the fashionable Cripples of both Sexes that resorted to him from all Parts of  Eu∣rope  Over his Door was fastened a large Golden Snout not unlike that which is placed over the great Gates at  BrazenNose  College in  Oxford  and as it is usual for the Learned in Foreign Uni∣versities to distinguish their Houses by a  Latin  Sentence the Doctor writ underneath this great Golden Proboscis Two Verses out of  Ovid  Militat omnis Amans habet sua Castra Cupido  Pontice crede mihi militat omnis Amans  It is reported That  Talicotius  had at one Time in his House Twelve  German  Counts Nineteen  French  Marquisses and a Hundred  Spanish  Cava∣liers besides One solitary  English  Esquire of whom more hereafter Tho' the Doctor had the Monopoly of Noses in his own Hands he is said not to have been unreasonable Indeed if a Man had Occasion for a high  Roman  Nose he must go to the Price of it A Carbuncle Nose likewise bore an excessive Rate But for your ordinary short turnedup Noses of which there was the greatest Consumption they cost little or nothing at least the Purchasers thought so who would have been content to have paid much dearer for them rather than to have gone without them  The Sympathy betwixt the Nose and its Parent was very extraordinary  Hudibras  has told us that when the Porter died the Nose dropped of Course in which Case it was always usual to return the Nose in order to have it interred with its first Owner The Nose was likewise affected by the Pain as well as Death of the Original Proprietor An eminent Instance of this Nature happen'd to Three  Spaniards  whose Noses were all made out of the same Piece of Brawn They found them one Day shoot and swell extremely upon which they sent to know how the Porter did and heard upon Enquiry that the Parent of the Noses had been severely kicked the Day before and that the Porter kept his Bed on Account of the Bruises it had received This was highly resented by the  Spaniards  who found out the Person that had used the Porter so unmercifully and treated him in the same Manner as if the Indignity had been done to their own Noses In this and several o∣ther Cases it might be said That the Porters led the Gentlemen by the Nose  On the other Hand if any Thing went a  with the Nose the Porter felt the Effects of  insomuch that it was generally articled with  Patient that he should not only abstain from  his old Courses but should on no Pretence wh  ¦soever smell Pepper or eat Mustard on whi  Occasion the Part where the Incision had be  made was seized with unspeakable Twinges a  Prickings  The  Englishman  I before mentioned was so ve  irregular and relapsed so frequently into the D  ¦stemper which at first brought him to the lear  Talicotius  that in the Space of Two Years he wo  out Five Noses and by that Means so torment  the Porters that if he would have given  for a Nose there was not one of them that wo  accommodate him This young Gentleman w  born of honest Parents and passed his first Yea  in Foxhunting but accidentally quitting t  Woods and coming up to  London  he was  charmed with the Beauties of the Playhou  that he had not been in Town Two Days befo  he got the Misfortune which carried off this P  of his Face He used to be called in  Germa  The  Englishman  of Five Noses and The Gentl  ¦man that had thrice as many Noses as he h  Ears Such was the Raillery of those Times  I shall close this Paper with an Admonition  the young Men of this Town which I think t  more necessary because I see several new fre  coloured Faces that have made their first A  ¦pearance in it this Winter I must therefore a  ¦sure them that the Art of making Noses is e  ¦tirely lost and in the next Place beg them not  follow the Example of our ordinary Town Rake  who live as if there was a  Talicotius  to be met wit  at the Corner of every Street Whatever youn  Men may think the Nose is a very becoming P  of the Face and a Man makes but a very silly Figu  without it But it is the Nature of Youth n  to know the Value of any Thing till they have lost it The general Precept therefore I shall leave with them is to regard every TownWoman as a particular Kind of Siren that has a Design up∣on their Noses and that amidst her Flatteries and Allutements they will fancy she speaks to 'em in that humorous Phrase of old  Plautus  Ego tibi Faciem denasabo mordicus  ' Keep your Face out of my Way or I'll bite off your Nose  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd Dec  to  Saturd Dec    From my own Apartment  Dec  IT is the Duty of all who make Philosophy the Entertainment of their Lives to turn their Thoughts to practical Schemes for the Good of Society and not pass away their Time in fruit∣less Searches which tend rather to the Ostenta∣tion of Knowledge than the Service of Life For this Reason I cannot for bear reading even the com∣mon Bills that are daily put into People's Hands as they pass the Streets which give us Notice of the present Residence the past Travels and in∣fallible Medicines of Doctors useful in their Gene∣ration though much below the Character of the renowned  Talicotius  But upon a nice Calcula∣tion of the Successes of such Adepts I find their Labours tend mostly to the enriching only one Sort of Men that is to say the Society of Upholders From this Observation and many other which oc∣cur to me when I am numbering the good People of  Great Britain  I cannot but favour any Propo∣sal which tends to repairing the Losses we sustain  by  eminent Cures  The best I have met with i  this Kind has been offered to my Consideratio  and recommended by a Letter subscribed  Thoma  Clement  The Title to his printed Articles ru  thus  By the Profitable Society at the  WheatShea  overagainst  Tom  's  Coffeehouse  in  RusselStreet CoventGarden  new Proposals for promoting a Con∣tribution towards raising Two Hundred and Fifty Pounds to be made on the Baptizing of any Infant born in Wedlock  The Plan is laid with such pro∣per Regulations as serves to such as fall in with it for the Sake of their Posterity all the Uses without any of the Inconveniencies of Sentlements By this Means such whose Fortunes depend upon their own Industry or Personal Qualifications need not be deterred by Fear of Poverty from that State which Nature and Reason prescribe to us as the Fountain of the greatest Happiness in Hu∣mane Life The Censors of  Rome  had Power vested in them to lay Taxes on the unmarried and I think I cannot show my Impartiality better than in enquiring into the extravagant Privileges my Brother Batchelors enjoy and fine them accord∣ingly I shall not allow a single Life in one Set to be reproached and held in Esteem in the other It would not methinks be amiss if an old Bat∣chelor who lives in Contempt of Matrimony were obliged to give a Portion to an old Maid who is willing to enter into it At the same Time I must allow that those who can plead Court∣ship and were unjustly rejected shall not be lia∣ble to the Pains and Penalties of Celibacy But such as pretend an Aversion to the whole Sex be∣cause they were ill treated by a particular Female and cover their Sense of Disappointment in Wo∣men under a Contempt of their Favour shall be proceeded against as Batchelors Convict I am not without Hopes that from this slight Warning all the unmarried Men of Fortune Tast and Refine∣ment will without further Delay become Lo∣vers  and humble Servants to such of their Ac∣  uaintance as are most agreeable to them under  ain of my Censures And it is to be hoped the  est of the World who remain single for fear of the  ncumbrances of Wedlock will become Subscri∣  ers to Mr  Clement  's Proposal By these Means  e shall have a much more numerous Account of  irths in the Year than any ever before  nown in  Great Britain  where meerly

I received the following Letter which seems to be dictated by a like modest and publick Spirit that makes Use of me also in its Design of obliging Mankind  Mr  Bickerstaff  IN the Royal Lottery for a

abovementioned continue such Bounties upon Pain of being publickly praised But there is no Probability of his running into that Hazard for a strong Habit of Virtue can make Men suspend the receiving

Things done by private Men in my Time As a Specimen of my Manner of noting such Actions take the follow∣ing Fragment out of much more which is written in my YearBook on the remarkable Will of a

whom he had given no such Expectation in his Lifetime  He was a Person of a very enlarged Soul and thought the nearest Relation among Men to be the Resemblance of their Minds and Sentiments He  was not mistaken in the Worth of his Successor who received the News of this unexpected good Fortune with an Air that showed him less moved with the Benefit than the Loss of the Benefactor  ADVERTISEMENT

between the Hours of Eight and Nine in the Evening The Indict∣ment set forth That the said Mr  Treatall  upon the Serving up of the Supper desired the Ladies to take their Places according to their different Age and Seniority for that it was the Way always at his Table to pay Respect to Years The ind ct∣ment added That this produced an unspeakable  Confusion in the Company for that the Ladies who before had pressed together for a Placo at the upper End of the Table immediately crowded with the same Disorder towards the End that was quite opposite That Mrs  Frontly  had the Inso∣leuce to clap her self down at the very lowest Place of the Table That the Widow  Partlett  seated her self on the Right Hand of Mrs  Frontly  alledging for her Excuse that no Ceremony was to be used at a Round Table That Mrs  Fidges  and Mrs  Fescue  disputed above half an Hour for the same Chair and that the latter would not give up the Cause till it was decided by the Pa∣rish Register which happened to be kept hard by The Indictment further said That the rest of the Company who sat down did it with a Reserve to their Right which they were at Liberty to assert on another Occasion and that Mrs  Mary Pippe  an old Maid was placed by the unanimous Vote of the whole Company at the upper End of the Table from whence she had the Confusion to be∣hold several Mothers of Families among her In∣feriors The Criminal alledged in his Defence That what he had done was to raise Mirth and avoid Ceremony and that the Ladies did not complain of his Rudeness till the next Morning having eaten up what he had provided for them with great Readiness and Alacrity The Censor frowning upon him told him That he ought not to discover so much Levity in Matters of a serious Nature and upon the Jury's bringing him in guilty sentenced him to treat the whole Assem∣bly of Ladies over again and to take Care that he did it with the Decorum which was due to Persons of their Quality  Rebecoa Shapely  Spinster was indicted by Mrs  Sarah Smack  for speaking many Words re∣siecting upon her Reputation and the Heels of her Silk Slippers which the Prisoner had mali∣ciousiy suggested to be two Inches higher than  they really were The Prosecutor urged as an Aggravation of her Guilt That the Prisoner was her self guilty of the same Kind of Forgery which she had laid to the Prosecutor's Charge for that she the said  Rebecca Shapely  did always wear a Pair of Steel Bodice and a false Rump The Censor ordered the Slippers to be produced in open Court where the Heels were adjudged to be of the Statutable Size He then ordered the Grand Jury to search the Criminal who after some Time spent therein acquitted her of the Bodice but found her guilty of the Rump upon which she received Sentence as is usual in such Cases  William Trippit  Esquire of the  MiddleTemple  brought his Action against the Lady  Elizabeth Prudely  for having refused him her Hand as he offered to lead her to her Coach from the Opera The Plaintiff set forth That he had entred himself into the List of those Volunteers who officiate e∣very Night behind the Boxes as GentlemenUsh∣ers of the Playhouse That he had been at a con∣siderable Charge in white Gloves Periwigs and SnuffBoxes in order to qualify himself for that Employment and in Hopes of making his For∣tune by it The Council for the Defendant re∣ply'd That the Plaintiff had given out that he was within a Month of wedding their Client and that she had refused her Hand to him in Ceremony lest he should interpret it as a Promise that she would give it him in Marriage As soon as their Plead∣ings on both Sides were finished the Censor or∣dered the Plaintiff to be cashier'd from his Office of GentlemanUsher to the Playhouse since it was too plain that he had undertaken it with an ill Design and at the same Time ordered the Defendant either to marry the said Plaintiff or to pay him Half a Crown for the new Pair of Gloves and Coachhire that he was at the Expence of in her Service  The Lady  Townly  brought an Action of Debt a¦gainst Mrs  Flambeau  for that the said Mrs  Flam¦beau  had not been to see the said Lady  Townly  and wish her Joy since her Marriage with Sir  Ralph  notwithstanding she the said Lady  Townly  had paid Mrs  Flambeau  a Visit upon her first coming to Town It was urged in the Behalf of the De∣fendant That the Plaintiff had never given her any regular Notice of her being in Town That the Visit she alledged had been made on a  Monday  which she knew was a Day on which Mrs  Flam∣beau  was always abroad having set aside that only Day in the Week to mind the Affairs of her Fami∣ly That the Servant who enquired whether she was at Home did not give the VisitingKnock That it was not between the Hours of Five and Eight in the Evening That there was no Can∣dles lighted up That it was not on Mrs  Flam∣beau  's Day and in short That there was not one of the essential Points observed that constitute a Visit She further proved by her Porter's Book which was produced in Court that she had paid the Lady  Townly  a Visit on the Twenty fourth Day of  March  just before her leaving the Town in the Year for which she was still Cre∣ditor to the said Lady  Townly  To this the Plain∣tiff only replied That she was now under Co∣vert and not liable to any Debts contracted when she was a single Woman Mr  Bickerstaff  finding the Cause to be very intricate and that several Points of Honour were likely to arise in it he de∣ferred giving Judgment upon it till the next Session Day at which Time he ordered the Ladies on his Left Hand to present to the Court a Table of all the Laws relating to Visits  Winifred Lear  brought her Action against  Ri∣chard Sly  for having broken a Marriage Contract and wedded another Woman after he had enga∣ged himself to marry the said  Winifred Lear  She alledged That he had ogled her twice ar an Ope∣ra  thrice in St  James  's Church and once at  Powel  's PuppetShow at which Time he promi∣sed her Marriage by a SideGlance as her Friend could testify that sat by her Mr  Bickerstaff  find∣ing that the Defendant had made no further Over∣ture of Love or Marriage but by Looks and Ocu∣lar Engagement yet at the same Time consider∣ing how very apt such impudent Seducers are to lead the Ladies Hearts astray ordered the Crimi∣nal to stand upon the Stage in the  Haymarket  be∣tween each Act of the next Opera there to be exposed to publick View as a false  Ogler  Upon the Rising of the Court Mr  Bickerstaff  having taken one of these Counterfeits in the very Fact as he was ogling a Lady of the Grand Jury ordered him to be seized and prosecuted upon the Statute of Ogling He likewise directed the Clerk of the Court to draw up an Edict against these common Cheats that make Women believe they are distracted for them by staring them out of Countenance and often blast a Lady's Reputa∣tion whom they never spoke to by saucy Looks and distant Familiarities  The TATLER N  o    Minimâ contentos Nocte Britannos  Juv Sat  From  Tuesday Dec  to  Thursday Dec    From my own Apartment  Dec  AN old Friend of mine being lately come to Town I went to see him on  Tusday  last about Eight a Clock in the Evening with a Design to sit with him an Hour or two and talk over old Stories but upon enquiring after him his Servant told me he was just gone to Bed The next Morn∣ing as soon as I was up and dressed and had dis∣patched  a little Business I came again to my Friend's House about Eleven a Clock with a Design to renew my Visit but upon asking for him his Servant told me he was just sat down to Dinner In short I found that my old fashioned Friend religiously adhered to the Example of his Forefathers and observed the same Hours that had been kept in the Family ever since the Con∣quest  It is very plain that the Night was much longer formerly in this Island than it is at present By the Night I mean that Portion of Time which Nature has thrown into Darkness and which the Wisdom of Mankind had formerly dedicated to Rest and Silence This used to begin at Eight a Clock in the Evening and conclude at Six in the Morning The Corfeu or Eight a Clock Bell was the Signal throughout the Nation for putting out their Candles and going to Bed  Our Grandmothers tho' they were wont to sit up the last in the Family were all of them fast asleep at the same Hours that their Daughters are busy at Crimp and Basset Modern Statesmen are concerting Schemes and engaged in the Depth of Politicks at the Time when their Forefathers were laid down quietly to Rest and had nothing in their Heads but Dreams As we have thus thrown Business and Pleasure into the Hours of Rest and by that Means made the natural Night but half as long as it should be we are forced to piece it out with a great Part of the Morning so that near Two thirds of the Nation lie fast asleep for several Hours in broad Daylight This Irre∣gularity is grown so very fashionable at present that there is scarce a Lady of Quality in  Great Britain  that ever saw the Sun rise And if the Humour encreases in Proportion to what it has done of late Years it is not impossible but our Children may hear the BellMan going about the Streets at Nine a Clock in the Morning and the  Watch making their Rounds till Eleven This unaccountable Disposition in Mankind to continue awake in the Night and sleep in Sunshine has made me enquire Whether the same Change of Inclination has happened to any other Animals For this Reason I desired a Friend of mine in the Country to let me know Whether the Lark rises as early as he did formerly And whether the Cock begins to crow at his usual Hour My Friend has answered me That his Poultry are as regular as ever and that all the Birds and the Beasts of his Neighbourhood keep the same Hours that they have observed in the Memory of Man and the same which in all Probability they have kept for these Five Thousand Years  If you would see the Innovations that have been made among us in this Particular you may only look into the Hours of Colleges where they still dine at Eleven and sup at Six which were doubt∣less the Hours of the whole Nation at the Time when those Places were founded But at present the Courts of Justice are scarce opened in  West∣minsterHall  at the Time when  William Rufus  used to go to Dinner in it All Business is driven forward The Land Marks of our Fathers if I may so call them are removed and planted fur∣ther up into the Day insomuch that I am afraid our Clergy will be obliged if they expect full Congregations not to look any more upon Ten a Clock in the Morning as a Canonical Hour In my own Memory the Dinner has crept by Degrees from Twelve a Clock to Three and where it will fix no Body knows  I have sometimes thought to draw up a Memo∣rial in the Behalf of Supper against Dinner set∣ting forth That the said Dinner has made several Encroachments upon the said Supper and entered very far upon his Frontiers That he has banished him out of several Families and in all has driven him from his Head Quarters and forced him to  make his Retreat into the Hours of Midnig  and in short That he is now in Danger of be  entirely confounded and lost in a Breakfast Th  who have read  Lucian  and seen the Complai  of the Letter  T  against  S  upon Account of ma  Injuries and Usurpations of the same Nature  not I believe think such a Memorial forced a  unnatural If Dinner has been thus postpo  or if you please kept back from Time to Ti  you may be sure that it has been in Complia  with the other Business of the Day and that Su  ¦per has still observed a proportionable Distanc  There is a venerable Proverb which we have a  of us heard in our Infancy of  putting the Child  to Bed and laying the Goose to the Fire  This w  one of the Jocular Sayings of our Forefathers  may be properly used in the Literal Sense at p  ¦sent Who would not wonder at this perver  Relish of those who are reckoned the most po  Part of Mankind that prefer SeaCoals and Ca  ¦dles to the Sun and exchange so many chearf  Morning Hours for the Pleasures of Midnig  Revels and Debauches If a Man was only  consult his Health he would chuse to live h  whole Time if possible in Daylight and to  ¦tire out of the World into Silence and Slee  while the raw Damps and unwholesome Vapo  fly Abroad without a Sun to disperse modera  or controul them For my own Part I value  Hour in the Morning as much as common Libe  ¦tines do an Hour at Midnight When I find  self awakened into Being and perceive my Li  renewed within me and at the same Time f  the whole Face of Nature recovered out of th  dark uncomfortable State in which it lay for  ¦veral Hours my Heart overflows with such sec  Sentiments of Joy and Gratitude as are a Kind  implicit Praise to the great Author of Nature  The Mind in these early Seasons of the Day is  refreshed in all its Faculties and born up wi  such new Supplies of Animal Spirits that she finds her self in a State of Youth especially when she is entertained with the Breath of Flowers the Melody of Birds the Dews that hang upon the Plants and all those other Sweets of Nature that are peculiar to the Morning  It is impossible for a Man to have this Relish of Being this exquisite Tast of Life who does not come into the World before it is in all its Noise and Hurry who loses the Rising of the Sun the still Hours of the Day and immediately upon his first getting up plunges himself into the ordinary Cares or Follies of the World  I shall conclude this Paper with  Milton  's inimi∣table Description of  Adam  's awakening his  Eve  in Paradise which indeed would have been a Place as little delightful as a barren Heath or De∣sert to those who slept in it The Fondness of the Posture in which  Adam  is represented and the Softness of his Whisper are Passages in this Di∣vine Poem that are above all Commendation and rather to be admired than praised  Now Morn her Rosie Steps in th' Eastern Clime  Advancing sow'd the Earth with Orient Pearl  When  Adam  wak'd so custom'd for his Sleep  Was Airylight from pure Digestion bred  And temperate Vapours bland which th' only Sound  Of

glowing Cheek  As through unquiet Rest He on his Side  Leaning half rais'd with Looks of Cordial Love  Hung over her enamour'd and beheld  Beauty which whether making or asleep  Shot forth peculiar Graces Then with Voice  Mild as when  Zephyrus  on  Flora  breaths  Her Hand soft touching whisper'd thus Awake  My fairest my espous'd my latest found  Heav'n's last best Gift my ever new Delight  Awake the Morning shines and the fresh Field  Calls us we lose the Prime to mark how spri  Our tended Plants how blows the Citron Gre  What drops the Myrrh and what the Balmy Ree  Now Nature paints

indicts a Laconick Writer for speaking that in Three Words which he might have said in Two and sentences him for his Punishment to read over all the Works of  Guicciardin  This  Guicciardin  is so very prolix and circumstantial in his Writing that I remember our Countryman Dr  Don  speal∣ing of that Majestick and Concise Manner is which  Moses  has described the Creation of the World adds  "That if such an Author as  Guic∣ciardin  were to have written on such a Subject the World it self would not have been able to have contained the Books that gave the History of its Creation'  I look upon a tedious Talker or what is gene∣rally known by the Name of a StoryTeller to  e much more insufferable than even a prolix Wri∣  r An Author may be toss'd out of your Hand  d thrown aside when he grows dull and tire∣  me but such Liberties are so far from being al∣  ed towards your Orators in common Conver∣  tion that I have known a Challenge sent a Per∣  n for going out of the Room abruptly and lea∣  ng a Man of Honour in the Midst of a Disserta∣  on This Evil is at present so very Common and  pidemical that there's scarce a Coffeehouse in  own that has not some Speakers belonging to it  ho utter their Political Essays and draw Paral∣  ls out of  Baker  's  Chronicle  to almost every Part  f Her Majesty's Reign It was said of two an∣  ent Authors who had very different Beauties in  eir Style That if you took a Word from one of  em you only spoiled his Eloquence but if you  ok a Word from the other you spoiled his Sense  have often applied the first Part of this Criticism  several of these Coffeehouse Speakers whom I  ave at present in my Thoughts tho' the Cha∣  acter that is given to the last of those Authors is what I would recommend to the Imitation of my  oving Countrymen But it is not only publick Places of Resort but private Clubs and Conver∣  ations over a Bottle that are infested with this  oquacious Kind of Animal especially with that  pecies which I comprehend under the Name of  StoryTeller I would earnestly desire these Gentlemen to consider that no Point of Wit or Mirth at the End of a Story can attone for the HalfHour that has been lost before they come at  t I would likewise lay it home to their serious Consideration Whether they think that every Man in the Company has not a Right to speak as well as themselves And whether they do not  hink they are invading another Man's Property when they engross the Time which should be di∣  ided equally amongst the Company to their own  rivate Use  What makes this Evil the much greater in Con¦versation is that these Humdrum Companion  seldom endeavour to wind up their Narrations in¦to a Point of Mirth or Instruction which might make some Amends for the Tediousness of them but think they have a Right to tell any Thing that has happened within their Memory They look upon Matter of Fact to be a sufficient Foun∣dation for a Story and give us a long Account of Things not because they are entertaining or sur∣prizing but because they are true  My ingenious Kinsman Mr  Humphrey Wagstaff  uses to say The Life of Man is too short for a StoryTeller  Methusalem  might be half an Hour in telling what a Clock it was but as for us Postdiluvians we ought to do every Thing in Hast and in our Speeches as well as Actions remember that our Time is short A Man that talks for a Quarter of an Hour together in Company if I meet him frequently takes up a great Part of my Span A Quarter of an Hour may be reckoned the Eight and fortieth Part of a Day a Day the Three hun∣dred and sixtieth Part of a Year and a Year the Threescore and tenth Part of Life By this moral Arithmetick supposing a Man to be in the Talk∣ing World one third Part of the Day whoever gives another a Quarter of an Hour's Hearing makes him a Sacrifice of more than the Four hun∣dred thousandth Part of his Conversable Life  I would establish but one great general Rule to be observed in all Conversation which is this  That Men should not talk to please themselves but those that hear them  This would make them consider Whether what they speak be worth Hearing Whether there be either Wit or Sense in what they are about to say And Whether it be adapted to the Time when the Place where and the Person to whom it is spoken  For the utter Extirpation of these Orators and  ryTellers which I look upon as very great  ts of Society I have invented a Watch which  ides the Minute into Twelve Parts after the  e Manner that the ordinary Watches are di∣  ded into Hours and will endeavour to get a  tent which shall oblige every Club or Com∣  ny to provide themselves with one of these  atches that shall lie upon the Table as an  ourGlass is often placed near the Pulpit to  easure out the Length of a Discourse  I shall be willing to allow a Man one Round of  y Watch that is a whole Minute to speak in  t if he exceeds that Time it shall be lawful for  y of the Company to look upon the Watch or  call him down to Order  Provided however That if any one can make  appear he is turned of Threescore he may take  o or if he pleases three Rounds of the Watch  ithout giving Offence Provided also That this  ule be not construed to extend to the Fair Sex  ho shall still be at Liberty to talk by the ordi∣  ary Watch that is now in Use I would likewise  rnestly recommend this little Automaton which  ay be easily carried in the Pocket without any  cumbrance to all such as are troubled with this  firmity of Speech that upon pulling out their Watches they may have frequent Occasion to  onsider what they are doing and by that Means  t the Thread of their Story short and hurry to  Conclusion I shall only add That this Watch  ith a Paper of Directious how to use it is sold  Charles Lillie  's  I am afraid a  Tatler  will be thought a very im∣  oper Paper to censure this Humour of being  alkative but I would have my Readers know  at there is a great Difference between Tattle and  oquacity as I shall show at large in a following  ucubration it being my Design to throw away  a Candle upon that Subject in order to expla the whole Art of Tattling in all its Branches as Subdivisions  The TATLER N  o    Arbiter hic igitur factus de Lite Jocosâ  Ovid Me  From  Saturday Dec  to  Tuesday Dec    Continuation of the Journal of the  Court of Honour  c  AS soon as the Court was sat the Ladies of the Bench presented according to Order a Table of all the Laws now in Force relating to Visits and VisitingDays methodically digested under their respective Heads which the Censor ordered to be laid upon the Table and after∣wards proceeded upon the Business of the Day  Henry Heedless  Esq  was indicted by Colonel  Touchy  of Her Majesty's TrainedBands upon an Action of Assault and Battery for that he the said Mr  Heedless  having espied a Feather upon the Shoulder of the said Colonel struck it of gently with the End of a WalkingStaff Value Three Pence It appeared That the Prosecutor did not think himself injured till a few Days after the aforesaid Blow was given him but that having ruminated with himself for several Days and conferred upon it with other Officers of the Militia he concluded that he had in Ef∣fect been cudgelled by Mr  Heedless  and that he ought to resent it accordingly The Council for the Prosecutor alledged That the Shoulder was the tenderest Part in a Man of Honour That it  ad a natural Antipathy to a Stick and that  ery Touch of it with any Thing made in the  ashion of a Cane was to be interpreted as a  ound in that Part and a Violation of the Per∣  n's Honour who received it Mr  Heedless  re∣  lied That what he had done was out of Kind∣  ess to the Prosecutor as not thinking it proper  r him to appear at the Head of the Trained  ands with a Feather upon his Shoulder and  rther added That the Stick he had made use of  n this Occasion was so very small that the Pro∣  cutor could not have felt it had he broken it  his Shoulders The Censor hereupon directed  e Jury to examine into the Nature of the Staff  r that a great deal would depend upon that  rticular Upon which he explained to them  e different Degrees of Offence that might be  iven by the Touch of Crabtree from that of  ane and by the Touch of Cane from that of  plain Hazle Stick The Jury after a short Per∣  sal of the Staff declared their Opinion by the  outh of their Foreman That the Substance of the  aff was  British  Oak The Censor then obser∣  ing that there was some Dust on the Skirts of  e Criminal's Coat ordered the Prosecutor to  eat it off with his aforesaid Oaken Plant and  us said the Censor I shall decide this Cause  the Law of Retaliation If Mr  Heedless  did  e Colonel a good Office the Colonel will by  is Means return it in Kind but if Mr  Heedless  ould at any Time boast that he had cudgelled e Colonel or laid his Staff over his Shoulders  e Colonel might boast in his Turn that he has  ushed Mr  Heedless  's Jacket or to use the  rase of an ingenious Author that he has rub∣  d him down with an Oaken Towel  Benjamin Busy  of  London  Merchant was in∣  ted by  Jasper Tattle  Esq  for having pulled out  Watch and looked upon it thrice while the  d Esquire  Tattle  was giving him an Account  of the Funeral of the said Esquire  Tattle  's fir  Wife The Prisoner alledged in his Defence  Tha  he was going to buy Stocks at the Tim  when he met the Prosecutor and that during the Story of the Prosecutor the said Stocks roe above Two  per Cent  to the great Detriment of the Prisoner The Prisoner further brought se¦veral Witnesses That the said  Jasper Tattle  Esq  was a most notorious StoryTeller That before he met the Prisoner he had hindred one of the Prisoners Acquaintance from the Pursuit of his lawful Business with the Account of his Second Marriage and that he had detained ano∣ther by the Button of his Coat that very Morn∣ing till he had heard several witty Sayings and Contrivances of the Prosecutor's eldest Son who was a Boy of about Five Years of Age Upon the whole Matter Mr  Bickerstaff  dismissed the Accusation as frivolous and sentenced the Prose∣cutor to pay Damages to the Prisoner for what the Prisoner had lost by giving him so long and patient an Hearing He further reprimanded the Prosecutor very severely and told him That if he proceeded in his usual Manner to interrupt the Business of Mankind he would set a Fi  upon him for every Quarter of an Hour's Imper∣tinence and regulate the said Fine according  the Time of the Person so injured should appear to be more or less precious  Sir  Paul Swash  Kt was indicted by  Peter Double  Gent for not returning the Bow which he received of the said  Peter Double  on  Wednesday  the Instant at the Playhouse in the  HayMarket  The Prisoner denied the Receipt of any such Bow and alledged in his Defence That the Profecutor would often times look full in his Face but that when he bowed to the said Prosecutor he would take no notice of  or bow to some Body else that sat quite on the othe  Side of him He likewise alledged That severa  Ladies had complained of the Prosecutor wh  ter ogling them a Quarter of an Hour upon  eir making a Courtesy to him would not re∣  rn the Civility of a Bow The Censor ob∣  erving several Glances of the Prosecutor's Eye  nd perceiving that when he talked to the Court he looked upon the Jury found Reason  suspect that there was a wrong Cast in his  ight which upon Examination proved true The Censor therefore ordered the Prisoner that  e might not produce any more Confusions in  ublick Assemblies never to bow to any Body whom he did not at the same Time call to by his  ame  Oliver Bluff  and  Benjamin Browbeat  were in∣  icted for going to fight a Duel since the Erection  f the  Court of Honour  It appeared That they were both taken up in the Street as they passed  y the Court in their Way to the Fields behind  MountagueHouse  The Criminals would answer  othing for themselves but that they were go∣  ng to execute a Challenge which had been made  bove a Week before the  Court of Honour  was  rected The Censor finding some Reasons to  uspect by the Sturdiness of their Behaviour  hat they were not so very brave as they would  ave the Court believe them ordered them both  o be searched by the Grand Jury who found a  reastPlate upon the one and Two Quires of Pa∣  er upon the other The BreastPlate was immedi∣  tely order'd to be hung upon a Peg over Mr  Bick∣  rstaff  's Tribunal and the Paper to be laid upon  he Table for the Use of his Clerk He then or∣  ered the Criminals to button up their Bosoms  nd if

and Dying  if any one would write  the Art of Growing Old  and teach Men to resign their Pretensions to the Pleasures and Gallantries of Youth in Proportion to the Alteration they find in themselves by the Approach of Age and Infirmities The Infirmities of this Stage of Life would be much fewer if we did not affect those which attend the more vigorous and active Part of our Days but instead of studying to be wiser or being contented with our present Fol∣lies the Ambition of many of us is also to be the same Sort of Fools we formerly have been I have often argued as I am a professed Lover of Women that our Sex grows old with a much worse Grace than the other does and have ever been of Opinion that there are more wellplea∣sed old Women than old Men I thought it a good Reason for this that the Ambition of the Fair Sex being confined to advantagious Mar∣riages or shining in the Eyes of Men their Parts were over sooner and consequently the Errors in the Performance of them The Conversation of this Evening has not convinced me of the con∣trary for one or two Fop Women shall not make a Ballance for the Crowds of Coxcombs among our selves diversified according to the different Pursuits of Pleasure and Business  Returning Home this Evening a little before my usual Hour I scarce had seated my self in my Easy Chair stirred the Fire and stroaked my Cat but I heard some Body come rumbling up Stairs I saw my Door opened and a Humane Figure ad∣vancing towards me so fantastically put together 'twas some Minutes before I discovered it to be my old and intimate Friend  Sam

Evening visited Two Widows who are now in that State I have often heard you call an AfterLife I suppose you mean by it an Existence which grows out of past Enter∣tainments and is an untimely Delight in the Sa∣tisfactions which they once set their Hearts upon too much to be ever able to relinquish Have but Patience continued he till I give you a suc∣cinct Account of my Ladies and of this Night's Adventure They are much of an Age but very different in their Characters The one of them with all the Advances which Years have made upon her goes on in a certain Romantick Road of Love and Friendship which she fell into in her Teens the other has transferred the amo∣rous Passions of her first Years to the Love of Cronies Petts and Favourites with which she is always surrounded but the Genius of each of them will best appear by the Account of what happened to me at their Houses About Five this Afternoon being tired with Study the Weather inviting and Time lying a little upon my Hands I resolved at the Instigation of my Evil Genius to visit them their Husbands having been our  Contemporaries This I thought I could do withou  much Trouble for both live in the very nex  Street I went first to my Lady  Camomile  and the Butler who had lived long in the Family and seen me often in his Master's Time ushered me very civilly into the Parlour and told me Though my Lady had given strict Orders to be denied he was sure I might be admitted and bid the BlackBoy acquaint his Lady that I was to wait upon her In the Window lay Two Let∣ters one broke open the other fresh sealed with a Wafer The first directed to the Divine  Cos∣melia  the second to the Charming  Lucinda  but both by the indented Characters appeared to have been writ by very unsteady Hands Such uncommon Addresses increased my Curiosity and put me upon asking my old Friend the Butler If he knew who those Persons were Very well says he This is from Mrs  Furbish  to my Lady an old SchoolFellow and great Crony of her La∣dyship's and this the Answer I enquired in what Country she lived Oh dear says he but just by in the Neighbourhood Why she was here all this Morning and that Letter came and was answered within these Two Hours They have taken an odd Fancy you must know to call one another hard Names but for all that they love one another hugely By this Time the Boy returned with his Lady's humble Service to me desiring I would excuse her for she could not possibly see me nor any Body else for it was Opera Night  Methinks says I such innocent Folly as Two old Women's Courtship to each other should rather make you merry than put you out of Humour Peace good  Isaac  says he no Inter∣ruption I beseech you I got soon to Mrs  Fee∣ble  's she that was formerly  Betty Frisk  you must needs remember het  Tom

was industri∣ously endeavouring to enter upon Conversation a violent Fit of Coughing seized her This a∣wakened Shock and in a Trice the whole Room was in an Uproar for the Dog barked the Squirrel squealed the Monkey chattered the Parrat screamed and  Ursula  to appease them was more clamorous than all the rest You  Isaac  who know how any harsh Noise affects my Head may guess what I suffered from the hi∣deous Din of these discordant Sounds At length all was appeased and Quiet restored A Chair was drawn for me where I was no sooner seat∣ed but the Parrat fixed his Horny Beak as sharp as a Pair of Sheers in one of my Heels just above the Shoe I sprung from the Place with an unusual Agility and so being within the Monkey's Reach he snatches off my n  w Bob Wig and throws it upon Two Apples that were roasting by a sullen SeaCoal Fire I was  nimble enough to save it from any further Da∣mage than singeing the Foretop I put it on and composing my self as well as I could I drew my Chair towards the other Side of the Chim∣ney The good Lady as soon as she had reco∣vered Breath employed it in making a Thousand Apologies and with great Eloquence and a nu∣merous Train of Words lamented my Misfor∣tune In the middle of her Harangue I felt something scratching near my Knee and feeling what it should be found the Squirrel had got in∣to my CoatPocket As I endeavoured to re∣move him from his Burrow he made his Teeth meet through the Fleshy Part of my ForeFinger This gave me an unexpressible Pain The  Hun∣gary  Water was immediately brought to bath it and Goldbeaters Skin applied to stop the Blood The Lady renewed her Excuses but being now out of all Patience I abruptly took my Leave and hobbling down Stairs with heedless Hast I set my Foot full in a Pail of Water and down we came to the Bottom together Here my Friend concluded his Narrative and with a composed Countenance I began to make him Compliments of Condoleance but he started from his Chair and said  Isaac  you may spare your Speeches I expect no Reply When I told you this I knew you would laugh at me but the next Wo∣man that makes me ridiculous shall be a young one  The TATLER N  o    Qui Genus humanum Ingenio superavit omnes  Restinxit Stellas exortus uti Aerius Sol  Lucr  From  Thursd Dec  to  Saturd Dec    From my own Apartment  December  I Have heard that it is a Rule among the Con∣ventuals of several Orders in the  Romish  Church to shut themselves up at a certain Time of the Year not only from the World in general but from the Members of their own Fraternity and to pass away several Days by themselves in settling Accounts between their Maker and their own Souls in cancelling unrepented Crimes and renewing their Contracts of Obedience for the future Such stated Times for particular Acts of Devotion or the Exercise of certain religious Duties have been enjoined in all civil Govern∣ments whatever Deity they worshipped or whatever Religion they professed That which may be done at all Times is often totally neg∣lected and forgotten unless fixed and determin∣ed to some Time more than another and there∣fore though several Duties may be suitable to every Day of our Lives they are most likely to be performed if some Days are more particularly set apart for the Practice of them Our Church has accordingly instituted several Seasons of De∣votion when Time Custom Prescription and if I may so say the Fashion it self call upon a Man to be serious and attentive to the great End of his Being  I have hinted in some former Papers that the greatest and wisest of Men in all Ages and Coun∣tries particularly in  Rome  and  Greece  were re∣nowned for their Piety and Virtue It is now my Intention to show how those in our own Na∣tion that have been unquestionably the most eminent for Learning and Knowledge were likewise the most eminent for their Adherence to the Religion of their Country  I might produce very shining Examples from among the Clergy but because Priestcraft is the common Cry of every cavelling empty Scribbler I shall show that all the Laymen who have ex∣erted a more than ordinary Genius in their Wri∣tings and were the Glory of their Times were Men whose Hopes were filled with Immortality and the Prospect of future Rewards and Men who lived in a dutiful Submission to all the Do∣ctrines of Revealed Religion  I shall in this Paper only instance Sir  Francis Bacon  a Man who for the Greatness of Genius and Compass of Knowledge did Honour to his Age and Country I could almost say to Hu∣mane Nature it self He possessed at once all those extraordinary Talents which were divided amongst the greatest Authors of Antiquity He had the sound distinct comprehensive Know∣ledge of  Aristotle  with all the beautiful Lights Graces and Embellishments of  Cicero  One does not know which to admire most in his Writings the Strength of Reason Force of Style or Bright∣ness of Imagination  This Author has remarked in several Parts of his Works that a thorough Infight into Phi∣losophy makes a good Believer and that a Smat∣tering in it naturally produces such a Race of despicable Infidels as the little profligate Wri∣ters of the present Age whom I must confess I have always accused to my self not so much for their Want of Faith as their Want of Learn∣ing  I was infinitely pleased to find among the Works of this extraordinary Man a Prayer of his own composing which for the Elevation of Thought and Greatness of Expression seems ra∣ther the Devotion of an Angel than a Man His principal Fault seems to have been the Excess of that Virtue which covers a Multitude of Faults This betrayed him to so great an Indulgence to∣wards his Servants who made a corrupt Use of it that it strip'd him of all those Riches and Honours which a long Series of Merits had heaped upon him But in this Prayer at the same Time that we find him prostrating himself before the great MercySeat and humbled un∣der Afflictions which at that Time lay heavy up∣on him we see him supported by the Sense of his Integrity his Zeal his Devotion and his Love to Mankind which give him a much higher Figure in the Minds of Thinking Men than that Greatness had done from which he was fallen I shall beg Leave to write down the Prayer it self with the Title to it as it was found among his Lordship's Papers written in his own Hand not being able to furnish my Reader with an Entertainment more suitable to this solemn Time  A Prayer or Psalm made by my Lord  Bacon  Chancellor of  England  MOST gracious Lord God my merciful Father from my Youth up my Creator my Redeemer my Comforter Thou O Lord soundest and searchest the Depths and Secrets of all Hearts Thou acknowledgest the Up∣right of Heart Thou judgest the Hypocrite Thou ponderest Men's Thoughts and Doings as in a Ballance Thou measurest their Intentions as with a Line Vanity and crooked Ways cannot be hid from Thee  Remember O Lord how thy Servant hath walked before thee remember what I have first sought and what hath been principal in my Intentions I have loved thy Assemblies I have mourned for the Divisions of thy Church I have delighted in the Brightness of thy San∣ctuary This Vine which thy Right Hand hath planted in this Nation I have ever pray∣ed unto Thee that it might have the first and the latter Rain and that it might stretch her Branches to the Seas and to the Floods The State and Bread of the Poor and Oppressed have been precious in mine Eyes I have hated all Cruelty and Hardness of Heart I have though in a despised Weed procured the Good of all Men If any have been my Enemies I thought not of them neither hath the Sun almost set upon my Displeasure but I have been as a Dove free from Superfluity of Maliciousness Thy Creatures have been my Books but thy Scriptures much more I have sought Thee in the Courts Fields and Gardens but I have found Thee in thy Temples  Thousands have been my Sins and Ten Thou∣sands my Transgressions but thy Sanctifica∣tions have remained with me and my Heart through thy Grace hath been an unquenched Coal upon thine Altar  O Lord my Strength I have since my Youth met with Thee in all my Ways by thy Fatherly Compassions by thy comfortable Cha∣stisements and by thy most visible Providence As thy Favours have increased upon me so have thy Corrections so as Thou hast been al∣ways near me O Lord And ever as my Worldly Blessings were exalted so secret Darts from Thee have pierced me and when I have ascended before Men I have descended in Hu∣miliation before Thee And now when I thought most of Peace and Honour thy Hand  is heavy upon me and hath humbled me ac∣cording to thy former loving Kindness keep∣ing me still in thy Fatherly School not as a Ba∣stard but as a Child Just are thy Judgments upon me for my Sins which are more in Num∣ber than the Sands of the Sea but have no Pro∣portion to thy Mercies for what are the Sands of the Sea Earth Heavens and all these are nothing to thy Mercies Besides my innu∣merable Sins I confess before Thee that I am Debtor to Thee for the gracious Talent of thy Gifts and Graces which I have neither put into a Napkin nor put it as I ought to Ex∣changers where it might have made best Pro∣fit but mispent it in Things for which I was least fit So I may truly say my Soul hath been a Stranger in the Course of my Pilgri∣mage Be merciful unto me O Lord for my Saviour's Sake and receive me unto thy Bosom or guide me in thy Ways  The TATLER N  o    O te Bollane Cerebri  Felicem Aiebam tacitus cum quidlibet ille  Garriret  Hor  From  Saturd Dec  to  Tuesd Dec    From my own Apartment  AT my coming Home last Night I found upon my Table the following Petition or Project sent me from  Lloyd  's Coffeehouse in the City with a Present of  Port  Wine which  had been bought at a late Auction held in that Place  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Censor of  Great Britain  Lloyd's Coffeehouse Lombardstreet  Dec  WE the Customers of this Coffeehouse observing that you have taken into your Consideration the great Mischiefs daily done in this City by Coffeehouse Orators do humbly beg Leave to represent to you That this Coffeehouse being provided with a Pulpit for the Benefit of such Auctions that are fre∣quently made in this Place it is our Custom upon the first coming in of the News to order a Youth who officiates as the Kidney of the Coffeehouse to get into the Pulpit and read every Paper with a loud and distinct Voice while the whole Audience are sipping their respective Liquors We do therefore Sir hum∣bly propose that there be a Pulpit erected within every Coffeehouse of this City and the adjacent Parts That one of the Waiters of the Coffeehouse be nominated as Reader to the said Pulpit That after the News of the Day has been published by the said Lecturer some Politician of good Note do ascend into the said Pulpit and after having chosen for his Text any Article of the said News that he do establish the Authority of such Article clear the Doubts that may arise thereupon compare it with Parellel Texts in other Papers advance upon it wholesome Points of Doctrine and draw from it salutary Conclusions for the Be∣nefit and Edification of all that hear him We do likewise humbly propose That upon any such Politician's quitting the Pulpit he shall be succeeded by any other Orator that finds himself moved by the same publick Spirit who shall be at full Liberty either to enforce or  overthrow what the other has said before him and may in the same Manner be succeeded by any other Politician who shall with the same Liberty confirm or impugn his Reasons streng∣then or invalidate his Conjectures enlarge upon his Schemes or erect new ones of his own We do likewise further propose That if any Person of what Age or Rank soever do pre∣sume to cavil at any Paper that has been read or to hold forth upon it longer than the Space of one Minute that he be immediately ordered up into the Pulpit there to make good any Thing that he has suggested upon the Floor We do likewise further propose That if any one plays the Orator in the ordinary Coffeehouse Conversation whether it be upon Peace or War on Plays or Sermons Business or Poetry that he be forth with desired to take his Place in the Pulpit  This Sir we humbly presume may in a great Measure put a Stop to those superficial Statesmen who would not dare to stand up in this Manner before a whole Congregation of Politicians not∣withstanding the long and tedious Harangues and Dissertations which they daily utter in pri∣vate Circles to the breaking of many honest Tradesmen the seducing of several eminent Citizens the making of numberless Malecon∣tents and to the great Detriment and Disquiet of Her Majesty's Subjects  I do heartily concur with my ingenious Friends of the abovementioned Coffeehouse in these their Proposals and because I apprehend there may be Reasons to put an immediate Stop to the Grie∣vance complained of it is my Intention That till such Time as the aforesaid Pulpits can be e∣rected every Orator do place himself within the Bar and from thence dictate whatsoever he shall think necessary for the publick Good  And further because I am very desirous th  proper Ways and Means should be found out f  the suppressing of StoryTellers and fine Talke  in all ordinary Conversation whatsoever I do i  ¦sist That in every private Club Company  Meeting over a Bottle there be always an Elbo  Chair placed at the Table and that as soon a  any one begins a long Story or extends his Di  ¦course beyond the Space of one Minute he  forthwith thrust into the said Elbow Chair  less upon any of the Company's calling out t  the Chair he breaks off abruptly and holds hi  Tongue  There are Two Species of Men notwithstand¦ing any Thing that has been here said whom  would exempt from the Disgrace of the Elbo  Chair The First are those Buffoons that have  Talent of mimicking the Speech and Behaviou  of other Persons and turning all their Patron  Friends and Acquaintance into Ridicule I loo  upon your  Pantomime  as a Legion in a Man or at least to be like  Virgil  's Monster with an Hun∣dred Mouths and as many Tongues  Linguae centum sunt Oraque centum  And therefore would give him as much Time to talk in as would be allowed to the whole Body of Persons he represents were they actually in the Company which they divert by Proxy Pro∣vided however That the said  Pantomime  do not upon any Pretence whatsoever utter any Thing in his own particular Opinion Language or Cha∣racter  I would likewise in the Second Place grant an Exemption from the Elbow Chair to any Person who treats the Company and by that Means may be supposed to pay for his Audience A Guest cannot take it ill if he be not allowed to talk in his Turn by a Person who puts his Mouth to a better Employment and stops it with good Beef  and Mutton In this Case the Guest is very a∣greeably silenced and seems to hold his Tongue under that Kind of Bribery which the Ancients called  Bos in Lingua  If I can once extirpate the Race of solid and substantial Humdrums I hope by my whole∣some and repeated Advices quickly to reduce the insignificant Tittletattles and MatterofFactMen that abound in every Quarter of this great City  Epictetus  in his little System of Morality pre∣scribes the following Rule with that beautiful Simplicity which shines through all his Precepts  Beware that thou never tell thy Dreams in Compa∣ny for notwithstanding thou may'st take a Pleasure in Telling thy Dreams the Company will take no Pleasure in Hearing them  This Rule is conformable to a Maxim which I have laid down in a late Paper and must always inculcate into those of my Readers who find in themselves an Inclination to be very talkative and impertinent That they should not speak to please themselves but those that hear them  It has been often observed by witty EssayWri∣ters That the deepest Waters are always the most silent That empty Vessels make the greatest Sound and tinckling Cymbals the worst Musick The Marquess of  Hallifax  in his admirable Ad∣vice to a Daughter tells her That good Sense has always something sullen in it But as Sullen∣ness does not only imply Silence but an illnatured Silence I wish his Lordship had given a softer Name to it Since I am engaged unawares in Quotations I must not omit the Satyr which  Horace  has written against this impertinent talka∣tive Companion and which I think is fuller of Humour than any other Satyr he has written This great Author who had the nicest Tast of Conversation and was himself a most agreeable Companion had so strong an Antipathy to a great  Talker that he was afraid some Time or other  would be mortal to him as he has very humo  ¦rously described it in his Conversation with  impertinent Fellow who had like to have be  the Death of him  Interpellandi Locus hic erat Est tibi Mater  Cognati queis te salvo est Opus Haud mihi qui qu  Omnes composui Felices nunc ego resto  Confice nam{que} instat Fatum

Apartment  December  I Find my Correspondents are universally of∣fended at me for taking Notice so seldom of their Letters and fear People have taken the Ad∣vantage of my Silence to go on in their Errors for which Reason I shall hereafter be more care∣ful to answer all lawful Questions and just Com∣plaints as soon as they come to my Hands The Two following Epistles relate to very great Mis∣chiefs in the most important Articles of Life Love and Friendship  Dorsetshire  Decemb  Mr  Bickerstaff  'TIS my Misfortune to be enamoured of a Lady that is neither very beautiful very witty nor at all wellnatured but has the Va∣nity to think she excels in all these Qualifica∣tions and therefore is cruel insolent and scorn∣ful When I study to please her she treats me with the utmost Rudeness and ill Manners If I approach her Person she fights she scratches me If I offer a civil Salute she bites me inso∣much that very lately before a whole Assem∣bly of Ladies and Gentlemen she rip'd out a considerable Part of my Left Cheek This is no sooner done but she begs my Pardon in the most handsome and becoming Terms imagina∣ble gives her self worse Language than I could  find in my Heart to do lets me embrace her to pacify her while she is railing at her self pro∣tests she deserves the Esteem of no one living says I am too good to contradict her when she thus accuses her self This attones for all tempts me to renew my Addresses which are ever returned in the same obliging Manner Thus without some speedy Relief I am in Danger of losing my whole Face Notwith∣standing all this I doat upon her and am sa∣tisfied she loves me because she takes me for a Man of Sense which I have generally thought except in this one Instance Your Re∣flections upon this strange Amour would be very useful in these Parts where we are overrun with wild Beauties and Romps I earnestly beg your Assistance either to deliver me from the Power of this unaccountable Inchantment or by some proper Animadversions civilize the Be∣haviour of this agreeable Rustick I am  SIR  Your most humble Servant  Ebenezer  Mr  Bickerstaff  I Now take Leave to address you in your Cha∣racter of Censor and complain to you That among the various Errors in Conversation which you have corrected there is one which tho' it has not escap'd a general Reproof yet seems to deserve a more particular Severity 'Tis an Hu∣mour of jesting on disagreeable Subjects and in∣sisting on the Jest the more it creates Uneasi∣ness and this some Men think they have a Ti∣tle to do as Friends Is the Design of Jesting to provoke Or does Friendship give a Privilege to say Things with a Design to shock How can that be call'd a Jest which has nothing in it but Bitterness 'Tis generally allow'd necessary  for the Peace of Company that Men should a little study the Tempers of each others but cer∣tainly that must be in order to shun what's of∣fensive not to make it a constant Entertain∣ment The frequent Repetition of what appears harsh will unavoidably leave a Rancour that's fatal to Friendship and I doubt much whether it would be an Argument of a Man's good Hu∣mour if he should be rouzed by perpetual Tea∣zing to treat those that do it as his Enemies In a Word whereas 'tis a common Practice to let a Story die meerly because it does not touch I think such as mention one they find does are as troublesome to Society and as unfit for it as  Wags Men of Fire good Talkers  or any other Apes in Conversation and therefore for the publick Benefit I hope you'll cause them to be branded with such a Name as they deserve I am  SIR  Yours  Patient Friendly  The Case of  Ebenozer  is a very common one and is always cured by Neglect These fantastical Returns of Affection proceed from a certain Va∣nity in the other Sex supported by a perverted Tast in ours I must publish it as a Rule That no Faults which proceed from the Will either in a Mistress or a Friend are to be tolerated But we should be so complaisant to Ladies to let them displease when they aim at doing it Pluck up a Spirit  Ebenezer  recover the Use of your Judgment and her Faults will appear or her Beauties vanish  Her Faults begin to please me as well as my own  is a Sentence very prettily put into the Mouth of a Lover by the Comick Poet but he never designed it for a Maxim of Life but the Picture of an Imperfection If  Ebenezer  takes my  Advice the same Temper which made her inso¦lent to his Love will make her submissive to hi  Indifference  I cannot wholly ascribe the Faults mentioned i  the Second Letter to the same Vanity or Prid  in Companions who secretly triumph over thei  Friends in being sharp upon them in Thing  where they are most tender But when this for  of Behaviour does not proceed from that Source  it does from Barrenness of Invention and an In∣ability to support a Conversation in a Way less offensive It is the same Poverty which makes Men speak or write smuttily that forces them to talk vexingly As obscene Language is an Ad∣dress to the Lewd for Applause so are sharp Al∣lusions an Appeal to the Illnatured But mean and illiterate is that Conversation where one Man exercises his Wit to make another exercise his Patience  ADVERTISEMENT  Whereas  Plagius  has been told again and again Both in publick and private That he preaches excel∣lently well and still goes on to preach as well as ever and all this to a polite and learned Audience This is to desire That he would not hereafter be so elo∣quent except to a Country Congregation the Pro∣prietors of  Tillotson  's Works having consulted the

Holydays to be no improper Season to enter∣tain the Town with the Addresses of my Corres∣pondents In my Walks every Day there appear all round me very great Offenders in the Point of Dress An armed Taylor had the Impudence Yesterday in the  Park  to smile in my Face and pull off a Laced Hat to me as it were in Con∣tempt of my Authority and Censure However it is a very great Satisfaction that other People as well as my self are offended with these Impro∣prieties The following Notices from Persons of different Sexes and Qualities are a sufficient In∣stance how useful my Lucubrations are to the Publick  Jack's Coffeehouse near Guildhall  Dec  Cousin  Bickerstaff  IT has been the peculiar Blessing of our Family to be always above the Smiles or Frowns of Fortune and by a certain Greatness of Mind to restrain all irregular Fondnesses or Passions From hence it is that though a long Decay and a numerous Descent have obliged many of our House to fall into the Arts of Trade and Business no one Person of us has ever made an Appearance that betrayed our be∣ing unsatisfied with our own Station of Life  or has ever affected a Mien or Gesture unsuit∣able to it  You have up and down in your Writings very justly remarked That it is not this or the other Profession or Quality among Men that gives us Honour and Esteem but the well or ill beha∣ving our selves in those Characters It is there∣fore with no small Concern that I behold in Coffeehouses and publick Places my Brethren the Tradesmen of this City put off the smooth even and ancient Decorum of thriving Citi∣zens for a fantastical Dress and Figure im∣proper for their Persons and Characters to the utter Destruction of that Order and Di∣stinction which of Right ought to be between St  James  's and  Milkstreet  the Camp and  Cheap∣side  I have given my self some Time to find out how distinguishing the Frays in a Lot of Mus∣lins or drawing up a Regiment of Thread Laces or making a Panegyrick on Pieces of Sagathy or  Scotch  Plod should entitle a Man to a Laced Hat or Sword a Wig tied up with Ri∣bands or an embroidered Coat The College say this Enormity proceeds from a Sort of De∣lirium in the Brain which makes it break out first about the Head and for Want of timely Remedies fall upon the Left Thigh and from thence in little Mazes and Windings run over the whole Body as appears by pretty Orna∣ments on the Buttons Buttonholes Garter∣ings Sides of the Breeches and the like I beg the Favour of you to give us a Discourse wholly upon the Subject of Habits which will contribute to the better Government of Conver∣sation amongst us and in particular oblige  SIR  Your affectionate Cousin  Felix Tranquillus  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Censor of  Great Britain  The humble Petition of  Ralph Nab  Haberdasher of Hats and many other poor Sufferers of the same Trade  SHEWETH  THat for some Years last past the Use of Gold and Silver Galloon upon Hats has been almost universal being undistinguishably worn by Soldiers 'Squires Lords Footmen Beaus Sportsmen Traders Clerks Prigs Smarts Cullies Pretty Fellows and Sharpers  That the said Use and Custom has been Two Ways very prejudicial to your Petitioners  First  in that it has induced Men to the great Damage of your Petitioners to wear their Hats upon their Heads by which Means the said Hats last much longer whole than they would do if worn under their Arms  Secondly  in that very often a new Dressing and a new Lace supply the Place of a new Hat which Grievance we are chiefly sensible of in the Springtime when the Com∣pany is leaving the Town it so happening commonly that a Hat shall frequent all Winter the finest and best Assemblies without any Or∣naments at all and in  May  shall be tricked up with Gold or Silver to keep Company with Ru∣sticks and ride in the Rain  All which Premisses your Petitioners humbly pray you to take into your Consideration and either to appoint a Day in your  Court of Honour  when all Pretenders to the Galloon may enter their Claims and have them approved or re∣jected or to give us such other Relief as to your great Wisdom shall seem meet  And your Petitioners  c  Order my Friend near  TempleBar  the Author of the  HuntingCock  to assist the Court when this Petition is read of which Mr  Lillie  to give him Notice  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Censor of  Great Britain  The humble Petition of  Elizabeth Slender  Spinster  SHEWETH  THat on the th of this Instant  Decembe  her Friend  Rebecca Hive  and your Peti¦tioner walking in the  Strand  saw a Gentleman before us in a Gown whose Periwig was so long and so much powder'd that your Peti¦tioner took Notice of it and said She wonder'd that Lawyer would so spoil a new Gown with Powder To which it was answered That he was no Lawyer but a Clergyman Upon a Wager of a Pot of Coffee we overtook him and your Petitioner was soon convinced she had lost  Your Petitioner therefore desires your Wor∣ship to cite the Clergyman before you and to settle and adjust the Length of Canonical Peri∣wigs and the Quantity of Powder to be made use of in them and to give such other Di∣rections as you shall think fit  And your Petitioner  c  Q  Whether this Gentleman be not Chaplain to a Regiment and in such Case allow Powder accor∣dingly  After all that can be thought on these Subjects I must confess That the Men who dress with a certain Ambition to appear more than they are are much more excusable than those who betray in the ado  ing their Persons a secret Vanity and Inclination to shine in Things wherein if they did succeed it would rather lessen than advance their Character For this Reason I am more provoked at the Allegations relating to the Clergyman than any other hinted at in these Complaints I have indeed a long Time with much Concern observed abundance of  Pretty Fellows  in Sacred  Orders and shall in due Time let them know that I pretend to give  Ecclesiastical  as well as  Ci∣vil  Censures A Man well bred and well dressed in that Habit adds to the Sacredness of his Fun∣ction and Agreeableness not to be met with a∣mong the Laity I own I have spent some Even∣ings among the Men of Wit of that Profession with an inexpressible Delight Their habitual Care of their Character gives such a Chastise∣ment to their Fancy that all which they utter in Company is as much above what you meet with in other Conversations as the Charms of a mo∣dest are superior to those of a light Woman I therefore earnestly desire our young Missionaries from the Universities to consider where they are and not dress and look and move like young Officers It is no Disadvantage to have a very handsome white Hand but were I to preach Re∣pentance to a Gallery of Ladies I would me∣thinks keep my Gloves on I have an unfeign∣ed Affection to the Class of Mankind appointed to serve at the Altar therefore am in Danger of running out of my Way and growing too serious on this Occasion for which Reason I shall end with the following Epistle which by my Interest in  Tom Trot  the PennyPost I procured a Co∣py of  To the Rev Mr  Ralph Incense  Chaplain to the Countess Dowager of  Brumpton  SIR  I Heard and saw you preach last  Sunday  I am an ignorant young Woman and under∣stood not half you said But ah Your Manner when you held up both your Hands toward our Pew Did you design to win me to Heaven or your self  Your humble Servant  Penitence Gentle  ADVERTISEMENTS  Mr  Proctorstaff  of  ClareHall  in  Cambridge  received as a Kinsman according to his Reques  bearing Date the th Instant  The Distressed Son of Aesculapius  is desired to be more particular  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturday Dec  to  Tuesday Jan    THE Printer having informed me That there are as many of these Papers printed as will make Four Volumes I am now come to the End of my Ambition in this Matter and have no∣thing further to say to the World under the Cha∣racter of  Isaac Bickerstaff  This Work has indeed for some Time been disagreeable to me and the Purpose of it wholly lost by my being so long un∣derstood as the Author I never designed in it to give any Man any secret Wound by my Conceal∣ment but spoke in the Character of an old Man a Philosopher an Humorist an Astrologer and a Censor to allure my Reader with the Variety of my Subjects and insinuate if I could the Weight of Reason with the Agreeableness of Wit The general Purpose of the whole has been to recommend Truth Innocence Honour and Virtue as the chief Ornaments of Life but I considered that Severity of Manners was abso∣lutely necessary to him who would censure others and for that Reason and that only chose to talk in a Mask I shall not carry my Humility so far as to call my self a vicious Man but at the same Time must confess my Life is at best but pardonable And with no greater Character  than this a Man would make but an indifferent Progress in attacking prevailing and fashionable Vices which Mr  Bickerstaff  has done with a Free∣dom of Spirit that would have lost both its Beau∣ty and Efficacy had it been pretended to by Mr  Steele  As to the Work it self the Acceptance it has met with is the best Proof of its Value but I should err against that Candour which an honest Man should always carry about him if I did not own that the most approved Pieces in it were written by others and those which have been most excepted against by my self The Hand that has assisted me in those noble Discourses up∣on the Immortality of the Soul the glorious Pro∣spects of another Life and the most sublime Idea's of Religion and Virtue is a Person who is too fondly my Friend ever to own them but I should little deserve to be his if I usurped the Glory of them I must acknowledge at the same Time that I think the finest Strokes of Wit and Humour in all Mr  Bickerstaff  's Lucubra∣tions are those for which he is also beholden to him  As for the Satyrical Parts of these Writings those against the Gentlemen who profess Gaming are the most licentious but the main of them I take to come from losing Gamesters as Invectives against the Fortunate for in very many of them I was very little else but the Transcriber If any have been more particularly marked at such Persons may impute it to their own Behaviour before they were touched upon in publickly speaking their Resentment against the Author and professing they would support any Man who should insult him When I mention this Sub∣ject I hope MajorGeneral  Davenport  Brigadier  Bisset  and my Lord  Forbes  will accept of my Thanks for their frequent good Offices in pro∣fessing their Readiness to partake any Danger  that should befal me in so just an Undertaking as the Endeavour to banish Fraud and Couze∣nage from the Presence and Conversation of Gentlemen  But what I find is the least excusable Part of all this Work is That I have in some Places in it touched upon Matters which concern both the Church and State All I shall say for this is That the Points I alluded to are such as concern∣ed every Christian and Freeholder in  England  and I could not be cold enough to conceal my Opinion on Subjects which related to either of those Characters But Politicks apart I must confess it has been a most exquisite Pleasure to me to frame Characters of Domestick Life and put those Parts of it which are least observed in∣to an agreeable View to enquire into the Seeds of Vanity and Affectation to lay before my Rea∣ders the Emptiness of Ambition In a Word to trace Humane Life through all its Mazes and Recesses and show much shorter Methods than Men ordinarily practise to be happy agreeable and great  But to enquire into Men's Faults and Weak∣nesses has something in it so unwelcome that I have often seen People in Pain to act before me whose Modesty only make them think them∣selves liable to Censure This and a Thousand other nameless Things have made it an irksome Task to me to personate Mr  Bickerstaff  any lon∣ger and I believe it does not often happen that the Reader is delighted where the Author is dis∣pleased  All I can now do for the further Gratification of the Town is to give them a faithful Index and Explication of Passages and Allusions and sometimes of Persons intended in the several scattered Parts of the Work At the same Time the succeeding Volumes shall discover which of the whole have been written by me and which  by others and by whom as far as I am able or permitted  Thus I have voluntarily done what I think all Authors should do when call'd upon I have published my Name to my Writings and given my self up to the Mercy of the Town as
