 AN EPISTLE FROM Mr  POPE  TO Dr  ARBUTHNOT  Neque sermonibus  Vulgi  dederis te nec in  Praemiis  humanis spem posueris rerum tuarum suis te oportet illecebris  ipsa Virtus  trahat ad verum decus Quid de te alii loquantur ipsi videant sed loquentur tamen  TULLY  LONDON  Printed by  J Wright  for LAWTON GILLIVER at  Homer  's  Head  in  Fleetstreet    ADVERTISEMENT  THIS Paper is a Sort of Bill of Complaint begun many years since and drawn up by snatches as the several Occasions offer'd I had no thoughts of publishing it till it pleas'd some Persons of Rank and Fortune the Authors of  Verses to the Imitator of Horace  and of an  Epistle to a Doctor of Divinity from a Nobleman at Hampton Court  to attack in a very extraordinary manner not only my Writings of which being publick the Publick judge but my  Person Morals  and  Family  whereof to those who know me not a truer Information may be requisite Being divided between the Necessity to say something of  Myself  and my own Laziness to undertake so awkward a Task I thought it the shortest way to put the last hand to this Epistle If it have any thing pleasing it will be That by which I am most desirous to please the  Truth  and the  Sentiment  and if any thing offensive it will be only to those I am least sorry to offend the  Vicious  or  the Ungenerous  Many will know their own Pictures in it there being not a Circumstance but what is true but I have for  the most part spar'd their  Names  and they may escape being laugh'd at if they please  I would have some of them know it was owing to the Request of the learned and candid Friend to whom it is inscribed that I make not as free use of theirs as they have done of mine However I shall have this Advantage and Honour on my side that whereas by their proceeding any Abuse may be directed at any man no Injury can possibly be done by mine since a Nameless Character can never be found out but by its  Truth  and  Likeness  AN EPISTLE TO Dr  ARBUTHNOT  _SHUT shut the door good  John  fatigu'd I said  Tye up the knocker say I'm sick I'm dead  The Dogstar rages nay 'tis past a doubt  All  Bedlam  or  Parnassus  is let out  Fire in their eye and Papers in their hand  They rave recite and madden round the land  What Walls can guard me or what Shades can hide  They pierce my Thickets thro' my Grot they glide  By land by water they renew the charge  They stop the Chariot and they board the Barge  No place is sacred not the Church is free  Ev'n  Sunday  shines no  Sabbathday  to me  Then from the  Mint  walks forth the Man of Ryme  Happy to catch me just at Dinnertime  Is there a Parson much bemus'd in Beer  A maudlin Poetess a ryming Peer  A Clerk foredoom'd his Father's soul to cross  Who pens a Stanza when he should  engross  Is there who lock'd from Ink and Paper scrawls  With desp'rate Charcoal round his darken'd walls  All fly to  Twit'nam  and in humble strain  Apply to me to keep them mad or vain  Arthur  whose giddy Son neglects the Laws  Imputes to me and my damn'd works the cause  Poor  Cornus  sees his frantic Wife elope  And curses Wit and Poetry and  Pope  Friend to my Life which did not you prolong  The World had wanted many an idle Song  What  Drop  or  Nostrum  can this Plague remove  Or which must end me a Fool's Wrath or Love  A dire Dilemma either way I'm sped  If Foes they write if Friends they read me dead  Seiz'd and ty'd down to judge how wretched I  Who can't be silent and who will not lye  To laugh were want of Goodness and of Grace  And to be grave exceeds all Pow'r of Face  I sit with sad Civility I read  With honest anguish and an aking head  And drop at last but in unwilling ears  This saving counsel "Keep your Piece nine years"  Nine years cries he who high in  Drurylane  Lull'd by soft Zephyrs thro' the broken Pane  Rymes e're he wakes and prints before  Term  ends  Oblig'd by hunger and Request of friends  "The Piece you think is incorrect why take it  "I'm all submission what you'd have it make it"  Three things another's modest wishes bound  My Friendship and a Prologue and ten Pound  Pitholeon  sends to me "You know his Grace  "I want a Patron ask him for a Place"  Pitholeon

Secret to each Fool that he's an Ass  The truth once told and wherefore shou'd we lie  The Queen of  Midas  slept and so may I  You think this cruel take it for a rule  No creature smarts so little as a Fool  Let Peals of Laughter  Codrus  round thee break  Thou unconcern'd canst hear the mighty Crack  Pit Box and Gall'ry in convulsions hurl'd  Thou stand'st unshook amidst a bursting World  Who shames a Scribler break one cobweb thro'  He spins the slight selfpleasing thread anew  Destroy his Fib or Sophistry in vain  The Creature's at his dirty work again  Thron'd in the Centre of his thin designs  Proud of a vast Extent of flimzy lines  Whom have I hurt has Poet yet or Peer  Lost the arch'd eyebrow or  Parnassian  sneer  And has not  C  lly  still his Lord and Whore  His Butchers  H

angry is quite innocent  Trust me 'tis ten times worse when they  repent  One dedicates in high Heroic prose  And ridicules beyond a hundred foes  One from all  Grubstreet  will my fame defend  And more abusive calls himself my friend  This prints my Letters that expects a Bribe  And others roar aloud "Subscribe subscribe  There are who to my Person pay their court  I cough like  Horace  and

him entituled  Dryden's Satyr to his Muse  has been printed in the Name of the Lord  Somers  of which he was wholly ignorant    With open arms receiv'd one Poet more  Happy my Studies when by these approv'd  Happier their Author when by these belov'd  From these the world will judge of Men and Books  Not from the  Authors of secret and scandalous History  Burnets Oldmixons  and  Cooks  Soft were my Numbers who could take offence  While pure Description held the place of Sense  Like gentle  Damon  's was my flow'ry Theme  A painted Mistress or a purling Stream  Yet then did  Gildon  draw his venal quill  I wish'd the man a dinner and sate still  Yet then did  Dennis  rave in furious fret  I never answer'd I was not in debt  If want provok'd or madness made them print  I wag'd no war with  Bedlam  or the  Mint  Did some more sober Critics come abroad  If wrong I smil'd if right I kiss'd the rod  Pains reading study are their just pretence  And all they want is spirit taste and sense  Comma's and points they set exactly right  And 'twere a sin to rob them of their Mite  Yet ne'r one sprig of Laurel grac'd these ribalds  From slashing  B  ley  down to pidling  T  ds  The Wight who reads not and but scans and spells  The Wordcatcher that lives on syllables  Such piecemeal Critics some regard may claim  Preserv'd in  Milton  's or in  Shakespear  's name  Pretty in Amber to observe the forms  Of hairs or straws or dirt or grubs or worms  The things we know are neither rich nor rare  But wonder how the Devil they got there  Were others angry I excus'd them too  Well might they rage I gave them but their due  A man's true merit 'tis not hard to find  But each man's secret standard in his mind  That Castingweight Pride adds to Emptiness  This who can gratify for who can  guess  The Bard whom pilf'red Pastorals renown  Who turns a  Persian  Tale for half a crown  Just writes to make his barrenness appear  And strains from hardbound brains eight lines ayear  He who still wanting tho' he lives on theft  Steals much spends little yet has nothing left  And he who now to sense now nonsense leaning  Means not but blunders round about a meaning  And he whose Fustian's so sublimely bad  It is not Poetry but Prose run mad  All these my modest Satire bid  translate  And own'd that nine such Poets made a  Tate  How did they fume and stamp and roar and chafe  How did they swear not  Addison  was safe  Peace to all such but were there One whose fires  True Genius kindles and fair Fame inspires  Blest with each Talent and each Art to please  And born to write converse and live with ease  Shou'd such a man too fond to rule alone  Bear like the  Turk  no brother near the throne  View him with scornful yet with jealous eyes  And hate for Arts that caus'd himself to rise  Damn with faint praise assent with civil leer  And without sneering teach the rest to sneer  Willing to wound and yet afraid to strike  Just hint a fault and hesitate dislike  Alike reserv'd to blame or to commend  A tim'rous foe and a suspicious friend  Dreading ev'n fools by Flatterers besieg'd  And so obliging that he ne'er oblig'd  Like  Cato  give his little Senate laws  And sit attentive to his own applause  While Wits and Templers ev'ry sentence raise  And wonder with a foolish face of praise  Who but must laugh if such a man there be  Who would not weep if  Atticus  were he  What tho' my Name stood rubric on the walls  Or plaister'd posts with Claps in capitals  Or smoaking forth a hundred Hawkers load  On Wings of Winds came flying all abroad  I sought no homage from the Race that write  I kept like  Asian  Monarchs from their sight  Poems I heeded now berym'd so long  No more than Thou great GEORGE a Birthday Song  I ne'r with Wits and Witlings past my days  To spread about the Itch of Verse and Praise  Nor like a Puppy daggled thro' the Town  To fetch and carry Singsong up and down  Nor at Rehearsals sweat and mouth'd and cry'd  With Handkerchief and Orange at my side  But sick of Fops and Poetry and Prate  To  Bufo  left the whole  Castalian  State  Proud as  Apollo  on his forked hill  Sate fullblown  Bufo  puff'd by ev'ry quill  Fed with soft Dedication all day long  Horace  and he went hand in hand in song  His Library where Busts of Poets dead  And a true  Pindar  stood without a head  Receiv'd of Wits an undistinguish'd race  Who first his Judgment ask'd and then a Place  Much they extoll'd the Pictures much the Seat  And flatter'd ev'ry day and some days eat  Till grown more frugal in his riper days  He pay'd some Bards with Port and some with Praise  To some a dry Rehearsal was assign'd  And others harder still he pay'd in kind  May some choice Patron bless each gray goose quill  May ev'ry  Bavius  have his  Bufo  still  So when a Statesman wants a Day's defence  Or Envy holds a whole Week's war with Sense  Or simple Pride for Flatt'ry makes demands  May Dunce by Dunce be whistled off my hands  Blest be the  Great  for those they take away  And those they leave meFor they left me GAY  Left me to see neglected Genius bloom  Neglected die and tell it on his Tomb  Of all thy blameless Life the sole Return  My Verse and QUEENSB'RY weeping o'er thy Urn  Give me on  Thames  's Banks in honest Ease  To see what Friends or read what Books I please  There let me live my own and die so too  "To live and die is all I have to do"  Above a Patron tho' I condescend  Sometimes to call a Minister my Friend  I was not born for Courts or great Affairs  I pay my Debts believe and go to Pray'rs  Can sleep without a Poem in my head  Nor know if  Dennis  be alive or dead  Why am I ask'd what next shall see the light  Heav'ns was I born for nothing but to write  Has Life no Joys for me or to be grave  Have I no Friend to serve no Soul to save  "I found him close with  Swift  Indeed no doubt  Cries prating  Balbus  "something will come out"  'Tis all in vain deny it as I will  "No such a Genius never can lye still"  And then for mine obligingly mistakes  The first Lampoon Sir  Will  or  Bubo  makes  Poor guiltless I and can I chuse but smile  When ev'ry Coxcomb knows me by my  Style  Curst be the Verse how well soe'er it flow  That tends to make one worthy Man my foe  Give Virtue scandal Innocence a fear  Or from the softey'd Virgin steal a tear  But he who hurts a harmless neighbour's peace  Insults fal'n Worth or Beauty in distress  Who loves a Lye lame slander helps about  Who writes a Libel or who copies out  The Fop whose pride affects a Patron's name  Yet absent wounds an Author's honest fame  Who can your Merit selfishly approve  And show the Sense of it without the Love  Who has the Vanity to call you Friend  Yet wants the Honour injur'd to defend  Who tells whate'er you think whate'er you say  And if he lyes not must at least betray  Who to the  See the Epistle to the Earl of  Burlington  Dean  and  silver Bell  can swear  And sees at  Cannons  what was never there  Who reads but with a Lust to misapply  Make Satire a Lampoon and Fiction Lye  A Lash like mine no honest man shall dread  But all such babling blockheads in his stead  Let  Paris  tremble"What that Thing of silk  "  Paris  that mere white Curd of Ass's milk  "Satire or Shame alas can  Paris  feel  "Who breaks a Butterfly upon a Wheel"  Yet let me flap this Bug with gilded wings  This painted Child of Dirt that stinks and stings  Whose Buzz the Witty and the Fair annoys  Yet Wit ne'er tastes and Beauty ne'er enjoys  So wellbred Spaniels civilly delight  In mumbling of the Game they dare not bite  Eternal Smiles his Emptiness betray  As shallow streams run dimpling all the way  Whether in florid Impotence he speaks  And as the Prompter breathes the Puppet squeaks  Or at the Ear of  In the fourth Book of  Milton  the Devil is represented in this Posture It is but justice to own that the Hint of  Eve  and the  Serpent  was taken from the  Verses on the Imitator of  Horace  Eve  familiar Toad  Half Froth half Venom spits himself abroad  In Puns or Politicks or Tales or Lyes  Or Spite or Smut or Rymes or Blasphemies  Did ever Smockface act so vile a Part  A trifling Head and a corrupted Heart  Eve  's Tempter thus the Rabbins have exprest  A Cherub's face a Reptile all the rest  Beauty that shocks you Parts that none will trust  Wit that can creep and Pride that licks the dust  Not Fortune's Worshipper nor Fashion's Fool  Nor Lucre's Madman nor Ambition's Tool  Nor proud nor servile be one Poet's praise  That if he pleas'd he pleas'd by manly ways  That Flatt'ry ev'n to Kings he held a shame  And thought a Lye in Verse or Prose the same  In Fancy's Maze that wand'ring not too long  He stoop'd to Truth and moraliz'd his song  That not for Fame but Virtue's better end  He stood

The Tales of Vengeance Lyes so oft o'erthrown  Lies so oft o'erthrown  Such as those in relation to Mr  A  that Mr  P  writ his Character after his death c that he set his Name to Mr  Broom  's Verses that he receiv'd Subscriptions for  Shakespear  c which tho' publickly disprov'd by the  Testimonies  prefix'd to the  Dunciad  were nevertheless shamelesly repeated in the Libels and even in the

Ten Years  It was so long before the Author of the  Dunciad  published that Poem till when he never writ a word of the many Scurrilities and Falsehoods concerning him  did he once reply  Three thousand Suns went down on  Welsted  's Lye  Welsted  's  Lye  This Man had the Impudence to tell in print that Mr  P  had occasion'd a  Lady's death  and to  name  a person he never heard of He also publish'd that he had libell'd the Duke of  Chandos  with whom it was added that he had liv'd in familiarity and receiv'd from him a Present of  five hundred pounds  The Falsehood of which is known to his Grace whom Mr  P  never had the honour to see but  twice  and never receiv'd any Present farther than the Subscription for  Homer  from him or from Any Great Man whatsoever  Budgel  in a Weekly Pamphlet call'd the  Bee  bestow'd much abuse on him in the imagination that he writ some things about the  Last Will  of Dr  Tindal  in the  Grubstreet Journal  a  Paper  wherein he never had the  least Hand Direction  or  Supervisal  nor the  least knowledge of its Authors  He took no notice of so frantick an Abuse and expected that any man who knew himself Author of what he was slander'd for would have justify'd him on that Article  To please a  Mistress  One aspers'd his life  He lash'd him not but let her be his  Wife  Let  Budgel  charge low  Grubstreet  on his quill  And write

Father was said to be a Mechanic a Hatter a Farmer nay a Bankrupt But what is stranger a  Nobleman  if such a Reflection can be thought to come from a Nobleman has dropt an Allusion to this pitiful Untruth in his  Epistle to a Doctor of Divinity  And the following Line  Hard as thy Heart and as thy Birth Obscure  had fallen from a like Courtly pen in the  Verses to the Imitator of Horace  Mr  Pope  's Father was of a Gentleman's Family in  Oxfordshire  the Head of which was the Earl of  Downe  whose sole Heiress married the Earl of  Lindsey  His Mother was the Daughter of  William Turnor  Esq of  York  She had three Brothers one of whom was kill'd another died in the Service of King  Charles  the eldest following his Fortunes and becoming a General Officer in  Spain  left her what Estate remain'd after the Sequestrations and Forfeitures of her FamilyMr  Pope  died in aged She in aged a very few Weeks after this Poem was finished    Yet why that Father held it for a rule  It was a Sin to call our Neighbour Fool  That harmless Mother thought no Wife a Whore  Hear this and spare his Family  James M *  Unspotted Names and memorable long  If there be Force in Virtue or in Song  Of gentle Blood part shed in Honour's Cause  While yet in  Britain  Honour had Applause  Each Parent sprung"What Fortune prayTheir own  And better got than  Bestia  's from a Throne  Born to no Pride inheriting no Strife  Nor marrying Discord in a Noble Wife  Stranger to Civil and Religious Rage  The good Man walk'd innoxious thro' his Age  No Courts he saw no Suits would ever try  Nor dar'd an Oath nor hazarded a Lye  Unlearn'd he knew no Schoolman's subtle Art  No Language but the Language of the Heart  By Nature honest by Experience wise  Healthy by Temp'rance and by Exercise  His Life tho' long to sickness past unknown  His Death was instant and without a groan  Oh grant me thus to live and thus to die  Who sprung from Kings shall know less joy than I  O Friend may each Domestick Bliss be thine  Be no unpleasing Melancholy mine  Me let the tender Office long engage  To rock the Cradle of reposing Age  With lenient Arts extend a Mother's breath  Make Languor smile and smooth the Bed of Death  Explore the Thought explain the asking Eye  And keep a while one Parent from the Sky  On Cares like these if Length of days attend  May Heav'n to bless those days preserve my Friend  Preserve him social chearful and serene  And just as rich as when he serv'd a QUEEN  Whether that Blessing be deny'd or giv'n  Thus far was right the rest belongs to Heav'n
