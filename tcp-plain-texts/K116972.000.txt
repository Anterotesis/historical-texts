longer the country invites  To me all its pleasures are void  Adieu to the healthbreathing hill  Thou canst not my comfort restore  For ever adieu my dear Will  My Henry alass is no more  SONG  BOY  When 'tis night and the mid watch is come  And chilling mists hang o'er the darken'd main  Then sailors think of their fardistant home  And of those friends they ne'er may see again  But when the fight's begun  Each serving at his gun  Should any thought of them come o'er our mind  We think that should the day be won  How 'twill cheer  Their hearts to hear  That their old companion he was one  Or my lad if you a mistress kind  Have left on shore some pretty girl and true  Who many a night doth listen to the wind  And sighs to think how it may fare with you  O when the fight's begun  Each serving at his gun  Should any thought of her come o'er your mind  Think only should the day be won  How 'twill cheer  Her heart to hear  That her own true sailor he was one  SONG  SUSAN  Oh stay my love my William dear  Ah whither art thou flying  Nor think'st thou of my parents here  Nor heed'st thy Susan sighing  Thy country's cause and honour call  Are words that but deceive thee  Thou seest my tears how fast they fall  Thou must not William leave me  Who'll o'er them watch if thus we part  In sickness or in sorrow  In some cold shed with breaking heart  Where will thy comfort borrow  Neglected left no William nigh  To chear protect relieve them  I helpless thrown aside to die  Thou must not William leave them  Ah me and think a summers flown  Perhaps we part for ever  The fondest hearts that e'er were known  Unpitying death will sever  Then why e'er waste or throw away  'Twill pass too soon believe me  Our day of love our little day  Thou must not William leave me  SONG  SPLICEM  When in war on the occean we meet the proud foe  With ardour for conquest our bosoms do glow  Shou'd they see on our vessels Old England's flag wave  Tis worthy of Britons who conquer to save  Their tricolour'd ensigns we view from afar  With three cheers they're welcom'd by each British tar  Whilst the Genius of Britain still bids us advance  Our great guns in thunder hurls defiance to France  But mark our last broadside she sinks down she goes  Quickly man all your boats they no longer are foes  To snatch a brave fellow from a wat'ry grave  Is worthy a Briton who conquers to save  Happy land thou hast now in defence of thy rights  Brave HOWE who the man and the hero unites  The friend to the wretched the boast of the brave  He lives still to conquer and conquers to save  QUINTETTO  SPLICEM COUNTRYMEN MARY and SUSAN  Th' eventful hour is near at hand  That must my destiny command  Ah could I purchase fortune's smile  Whole years of fortune pain and toil  I'd yield to her capricious pow'r  And bribe her for that single hour  SONG  TOM OAKUM  O'er the vast surface of the deep  Britain shall still her empire keep  Her heav'ndescended charter long  The fav'rite theme of glory's song  Shall still proclaim the blest decree  That Britons ever shall be free  "Though hostile bands in fierce array  "Dare to dispute her sovereign sway  "Though savage fury nurs'd in gore  "Boast to despoil her silver shore  "Heav'n still supports her best decree  "That Britons ever will be free  "'Twas thus with HOWE illustrious name  "Still adding to a life of fame  "Through Gallia's proud Armada broke  "And Albion's wrath in thunder spoke  "While Vict'ry sanction'd the degree  "That Britons ever shall be free  Hail happy Britain favour'd isle  Where freedom arts and commerce shine  Long may thy George in glory prove  The transports of a nation's love  Long reign to guard the blest decree  That Britons ever shall be free  DUET  MARY and SUSAN  Our hearts with joy expanding  Your voice our fate commanding  Most grateful thanks demanding  Accept the tribute due  Whatever good befalling  We still shall think of you  Adieu  Whatever good befalling  Our gratitude recalling  We still shall think of you  ACT II  SONG  MARGARETTA  Never never when you 've won us  Can we trust in faithless man  For our constant love you shun us  And we're dup'd do all we can  Soon the passion you pretended  Like a magic charm is ended  While we're grieving sobbing crying  You're to others kneeling sighing  Wheedling vowing weeping dying  To betray where'er you can  Never never c  Silly maidens here take warning  Vows of love with prudence scorning  Never never c  DIALOGUE DUET MARGARETTA and SUSAN  Marg  Of lover's you'll have plenty  Be married ere you're twenty  The youth whom most you favour  Is gone hence a far  An honest farmer wooes you  A lawyer too pursues you  But ah your heart's enslaver  Is a British Tar  His country's cause espousing  The trump of glory rousing  His valour's best emotion  He'll a conq'ror prove  But ah the fatal story  The heart which pants for glory  Inconstant as the ocean  Susan  And is he false in love  Marg  This morning I espied you  By magic art descried you  The sailor's gift receiving  It was a purse of gold  Susan  I'll pay it where 'tis owing  A keepsake too bestowing  My kindred's wants relieving  Marg  Your gratitude thus raising  His noble bounty praising  Your heart so fond believing  Susan  Is to my William true  Marg  The traitor's love disdaining  That keepsake why retaining  Both  In trust this pledge receiving  Is Margaretta's due  SONG  BEN  Our line was form'd the French lay too  One sigh I gave to Poll on shore  Too cold I thought our last adieu  Our parting kisses seem'd too few  If we should meet no more  But love avast my heart is oak  Howe's daring signal floats on high  I see through roaring cannon's smoke  Their awful line subdued and broke  They strikethey sinkthey fly  CHORUS  Now danger past w'll drink and joke  Sing "Rule Britannia hearts of oak"  And toast before each martial tune  Howe and the Glorious first of June  Farewell to every sea delight  The cruize with eager watchful days  The skilfull chase by glimering night  The well work'd ship the gallant fight  The lov'd commander's praise  Yet Polly's love and constancy  With prattling babes more joy shall bring  Proud when my boys shall first at sea  Follow great Howe and victory  And serve our noble King  CHORUS  Then c  FINALE RULE BRITANNIA Verse and Chorus
