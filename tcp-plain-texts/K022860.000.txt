 AN ENQUIRY Into the DANGER AND CONSEQUENCES OF A WAR With the  DUTCH  LONDON  Printed for  J Baker  at the  BlackBoy  in  PaterNosterRow    An ENQUIRY into the DANGER  c  I CANNOT say that I am of the Number of those who wish that if we have a War with the  Dutch  they may beat Us because it has something in it so unnatural for an  Englishman  or a  Britain  to rejoyce in the Destruction of his own Country and in the Triumph of our Neighbours of any kind over Us that he cannot see it without Horror and Aversion yet I cannot but say I wish  those  who talk with so much Satisfaction of a War with the  Dutch  would look a little into the certain Consequences of such a War whether Victory or Disadvantage on Our Side shall attend it  I take a War with the  Hollanders  to have this very unhappy Circumstance in it That if we are beaten it may be  ruin immediately and if we conquer it may be our ruin hereafter so that in general get or lose in the Field we shall certainly lose in the War  The immediate Loss of our Ships of our Men of our Trade and the farther loading this Nation with a mighty and insupportable Expence are the common Topicks  of those who argue in the usual Methods against this War but though these are considerable and shall have something said to them in their Course yet these are the least of the Evils which if our Foresight is not clouded by the Power and Influence of Parties found may be by necessary and inevttable Consequences to follow the entring at this time upon a War with the  Dutch  The Situation of the  Dutch  their Strength at Sea their Possessions in the  East  and  WestIndies  and their reigning Influence in the  North  and  East  Seas are Reasons why we must expect uncommon Mischiefs should attend our Trade in the beginning of such a War this was always the Effect of a  Dutch  War and it was remarkable that in the last War with the  Dutch  we lost Sail of Ships great and small the first Year No part of our Commerce is free from them or out of their reach On the contrary some of the best Parts of our Trade are in great Danger of being entirely lost to them such as the  EastIndia African  and  East  Country Trades in particular it is apparent if a due Enquiry were made we should see small hope of continuing and preserving our Interest in them under a War with the  Dutch  their Collonies of superiour Strength lying so near ours in the two First and their Potent Alliances in the latter enabling them effectually to supplant Us  The Disturbance they always upon these Occasions gave us in our  Home Trade  and the impossibility of our carrying it on but with  manifest Disadvantage is a strong Argument to open our Eyes in the Case of a  Dutch  War there are other Parts which respect our Coal and Salt Trade our Corn Trade our  Hull  and  Lynn  Carriage our Trade to  Scotland  and our Fishing Trade In all which the Interruptions of Commerce by a  Dutch  War have been such as have been felt by all our People  The Gentlemen who are so fond of this War with the  Dutch  have perhaps not yet examin'd the Trading Consequences of it and as they are Landed Men and fancy they are no way dependent upon Trade they have forgotten what so often and by so many unanswerable Arguments has been proved to them  viz  That as Trade only was the Original Cause of the encreas'd Value of Lands and the high Rents which now the Gentlemen receive so the decay and ruin of Trade must of course sink the Value of Land lower the Rents and reduce the Tenant to an incapacity to support the Landlord by which means a War will of course affect the Landedman as well as the Merchant Wherefore the Landed Gentlemen are desired to give themselves the Trouble to enquire into the following Particulars as they are likely to be affected by a War with the  States General  First  Whether the Landed Men about  New Castle  upon  Tyne  will not be effected by the interruption of the Coal Trade Whether when Coals are at  l  a Chaldron at  London  and on the Coasts it will not considerably lessen the Consumption And whether in the last  Dutch  War the Quantity of Coals carry'd out were not lessen'd above Chaldron in a Year  Secondly  Whether the Landed Men bordeing upon all the Coasts from  Hull  in the  North  to the River  Thames  and on to the Coast of  Kent  and  Sussex  will not be affected by the Stop put to the vast Exportation of Corn to  Holland c  the want of which Sale must of necessity make the Price fall in  England  by which the Tenant not being able to get a Market for his Corn is disabled to pay his Rent or hold his Farm without an Abatement  Thirdly  Whether the Stop put to the vast Exportation of our Woolen Manufactures to  Holland  and which will be interrupted if not prohibited by a War will not ruin Multitudes of our Manufacturers in the Country leave the Poor without Employment and prevent or greatly lessen not the Consumption of Wool only but the General Consumption of Provisions by which the Landed Men's Estates must of course be reduced and their Rents remain unpaid  These Things if it was imagin'd any Man could object against them might be farther enlarg'd upon and the particular Trades which would suffer in such an Interruption  of Commerce might be examined where it would appear  That the great Trade of Broad Cloath Kersies  c  one of the greatest Branches of Trade in  England  particularly at  Leeds Huthersfield Wakefield Hallifax Bradford Rochdale  and the adjacent Parts and where it is by modest Computation supposed Four Hundred Thousand People are employ'd and maintained in the Woolen Manafacture that this great Trade is principally maintained and supported by the Exportation to  Holland  That the Stop to that Exportation must of necessity encourage the  Dutch  in the Making the same kind of Goods in their own Country particularly at  Leyden  where they have for some Years endeavour'd it and are Daily improving  That above Two Hundred Thousand Pound Value of the said Goods are Yearly exported to  Holland  That the NorthRiding of  Yorkshire  Bishoprick of  Durham  and great part of  Lancashire  and  Westmoreland  are supported by breeding and feeding Cattle for the Consuption of the  West Riding  and if the  Dutch  Trade receive such a Check or Interruption the Consequence is evident the poor People will want Employ which want of Employ is immediately felt in the Consumption of Provisions and that again in the Rent of our Lands And indeed it cannot be a little wonder'd at to see the Landed Men in this Nation value themselves  so much upon their running down our Trade as if the Lands had no Dependance upon Trade or that Lands cou'd hold up their Value if our Trade were decay'd This Article of the  Dutch  Trade will satisfy any reasonable Person that it cannot be I pray God we do not too fatally try the Experiment at this time nor is this the least Reason why I mention this Argument at this time that our LandedMen may learn to know what made them rich and what may again reduce them to what they were some Ages ago  It is true Trade has given us no Land  Britain  is no larger than it was before but it is not unworthy our Thoughts and may be proper to recommend it to these Gentlemen to consider That Trade has added a new Value to what we had before the Rents of Lands are risen in time to such a Degree that what was formerly worth  l per Ann  is now worth  l per Annum  and what has done this What but our Trade Our General Commerce which had it been more effectually covered encouraged and understood would have been able to have done much more  Come we next to speak to the  CornTrade  this is more sensibly understood by those Gentlemen whose Estates lye near the Sea more particularly upon the Coasts of  Lincolnshire Yorkshire  and the several Countries which border upon the  Humber  or on the Navigable Rivers emptying themselves into the  Humber  as also upon the Coasts of  Norfolk  such as  Yarmouth Cromer Clye Wells Burnham  and  Lynn  the Navigations of the River  Ouse  and the Towns of  Wisbich  and  Spalding  in the Isle of  Ely  again on the Coasts of  Sussex Essex  and  Kent  all which Counties find their Daily Advantages from the incredible Quantity of Corn every Year exported to  Holland  without which Exportation it would be impossible for the Tenants in those Countries to vend the Corn they owe and by Consequence the Lands in those Counties must either lye unmanur'o or at least be laid down and only employ'd in breeding of Cattle a poor Trade and which is now left to the  Northern  and  Western  Parts of  England  and to the  Highlands  of  Scotland  the Consequence of which would be the lessening the Value of Land sinking the Rents and reducing the Estates of the Landed Men  These would be some of the more immediate Consequences of a War with the  Dutch  and are mention'd here because as Mankind are more apt to be sensible of that Mischief most which touches them soonest it cannot but be very reasonable to expect That these People however at present unaffected with the Danger of a War with  Holland  may think fit to change their Minds when they examine more stricly into the thing and shall find that they will be immediately touch'd by it in the most sensible part  There are several other immediate Cases in which a War with  Holland  will affect us in Matters of Trade and which it having  been so long ago since we had such a War our People are a little too apt to forget But which if they please to recollect themselves they will find will more nearly touch them than perhaps they are aware of as especially the Price of Coals touch'd at before which will particularly affect the Inhabitants of this City and County's adjacent where Three Pounds and Four Pounds a Chaldron have been accounted but a moderate Price for Coals and which is occasion'd by the direct Situation of the  Hollanders  whose Ports immediately opening to the North Channel the  Colliers  Ships are in ten Fold more danger from them than they can be from the  French  Privateers in Case of a War with  France  It is needless to enlarge how many other Trades this will affect how much dearer it will make all such Goods as are wrought by Fire but especially how severely it will pinch the midling Families of our Tradesmen and the Poor who have no Relief in Case of Cold Weather about this City there being no Woods and Forrests as in the Country to supply them with Fewel and who are put to inexpressible Hardships in the Winter for want of Coal  The Rates of  Salt  another Necessary of Life is a Thing deserves our Consideration in Case of Trade the City of  London  and all this Part of  England  being supply'd with  Salt  from  New Castle  upon  Tyne  from whence the Danger being so great the Price of  Salt  was frequently in the late  Dutch  War although no Tax was then upon it at  d  per  Pound and may now possibly be double that Price  These are Matters of Trade and indeed are but a small part of what might be said upon that Subject but however may serve to shew That a War with  Holland  can never happen without plunging us into many great Difficulties such as will justify me in saying That we ought never to engage in such a War without such an absolute and unavoidable Necessity as will abundantly make the bearing all these Inconveniences easy and rational to Us  But alas these are but the smaller Considerations in this Case and are mentioned here in order to make good the first part of the Argument laid down in the beginning of this Work The more fatal Consequences of a War with the  Dutch  are such as respect the Politick Concerns of  Europe  and are of infinite Value to Us I shall examin them apart  I It must be a War in Defence of  Popery  II It must be ruinous to the  Protestant Interest  III It must be Dangerous to the  Hannover  Succession  IV It must be fatal many ways to us who are to be engag'd in it  V It must be a War against the general Inclination of the People  VI It must be a War in which the greatest Success will be a Loss to Us  VII It must be a War in which we are very likely to have the Disadvantage  VIII It must be a very bloody War that will be far from being carry'd on in Jest as the present War with  France  has been especially at Sea  I cannot promise to go thorow all these effectually in the short Compass of this Tract However I shall begin and speaking more largely to those which are most necessary I shall touch lightly the rest and perhaps speak more effectually to them hereafter  I It must be a War in Defence of Popery  I know it has been argued on many Occasions That this War was not begun on account of  Religion  it was the Argument the  Papists  and  French  Advocates strove to make use of all along subtilly to engage the Zealous People the more sincerely in their Quarrel and stir them up to Blood and Destruction We find many Instances of this in the Accounts of the last few Years especially in the King of  France  's Letter to the  Pope  relating to the Duke of  Savoy  who was then newly come over to the Confederates wherein he complains of his Royal Highness joining with  Hereticks  and the Enemies of God's Church meaning the  Prussian  and  SaxeGotha  Troops whom he calls Enemies to GOD and his Church and which he says they impiously brought into  Italy  But after all that has been said on that Head  tho' we are not now on the Foot of a Religious War yet if we fight with the  Dutch  we certainly fight against the Protestant Religion in Defence of Popery perhaps it may not be immediately concern'd but it is so in its visible Effects and no Man can be so blind as not to see it The Powers hereby protected are all Popish Popish even to Bigottry especially the  Spaniards  They have not only strengthened themselves against the Protestant Religion but by the Destruction of the Protestants themselves and that in the severest manner  Let any Man but take a View of them separately  in France  how has the  French  Governor expelled Protestants out of their Dominions suffering all the Damages which the loss of so many Subjects and their moveable Estates must of necessity be to a Nation rather than not to root out the Protestant Religion and indeed they have rooted it out of most part of the Nation and one Age of Persecution more will most effectually do it How have they since pursued the poor Remains of the Protestant Religion in the Mountains of the  Cevennes  and put all that have fallen into their Hands to Death by the cruellest Torments imaginable How have they lately done the same in the little Principallity of  Orange  tho' in all probability they were to restore that Country upon a Peace In  Spain  how have we found the Aversions of the People to our great Damage in the War there while our Troops have been Maletreated by the  Spaniards  and  Porteguese  even while we came there to assist them rejecting their own Deliverance  I speak of those well affected to King  Charles III only because the Assistance brought them was carry'd on by Heretick Forces and that the Protestants were so odious to them that they could not bear to be deliver'd by them These are the People we must fight for when ever we take up Arms against the  Hollanders  for these the Blood of  English  Men and  Britains  is to be spilt and the Wealth of a Protestant Nation exhausted and that not only for the People of these Nations but for their very Religion too could we distinguish between the Men and their Principles between the Interest of the Nations and the Interest of their Religion it were the better to be born with But our Case is extremly hard for it is not so much the National Interest as the Religious Interest that eventually will be the Concern of the War and we fight even for Popery it self The Propagation of the Bigottry and Superstition of those Nations being so twisted with their Power that the latter never goes without the former and they never did extend their Conquest and Dominions to any Place where they have not established their Idolatry and Superstition nay nor where they have not apply'd themselves to expunge and race out the very Name of the Protestant Religion and the least Remains of the Protestant Worship This confirms the Head I am upon that when ever  the unhappy Hour shall come that the Sword should be drawn in this Quarrel it is drawn by the Nature and Consequence of the Thing in Defence of POPERY What Protestant then can think of this without Horror How ruinous must this be to the Protestant Interest How destructive to the Safety of Religion to the Freedom of Conscience and to the Prosperity of the Churches abroad  Of which by it self  but particularly how dreadful a Work must this be for Protestants to do With what Face can any Man who is a Professor of the Protestant Religion draw his Sword in such a Quarrel And which is still worse how can any Protestant put his Hand to the contriving and bringing to pass such a War I have no Hand in or Eye towards who is or is not concern'd in the Measures that have a Tendency to this some say one side are guilty of it some the other and both seem to agree that it will be a Consequence of what is now doing but I am desirous faithfully to represent to both Sides what the meaning of a War with  Holland  is what it implies and what Effects will necessarily follow that both Parties may lay their Hands upon their Hearts and reflect with Seriousness what they are about when they draw their Swords against their Brethren  II It must be ruinous to the Protestant Interest  This is little more than the Reverse of the other as to the part of Religion because  the Defence of Popery must be the Ruin or at least the Damage of the Protestant Religion but I choose to call this the  Protestant Interest  because tho' the Religious Interest depends upon it and must follow the Fate of it upon all Occasions yet the Civil and Politick Interest of the Protestants is what I am now speaking of and how far the present Case will affect it will soon appear Nothing is more evident than that the Kingdoms of  Great Britain  and  Ireland  in Conjunction with the States General are the main Strength of the Protestant Interest in the World The Princes of  Germany  with the Kings of  Sweden  and  Denmark  are considerable it is true and not at all to be despised but alas how long would all these put together be able to support the Protestant Cause or to defend themselves against the Power of  French  and  German  Popery How soon would the Light of the Protestant Religion in the World be extinguished if the Popish Powers of  Europe  were combin'd against those few Northern Provinces But the Center of Protestant Strength lies in the joint Forces Power and Wealth of the Two Maritime Potentates  Great Britain  and  Holland  their Forces by Land have alone been able to match the Popish Powers of  Europe  and to look the King of  France  in the Face and their United Force at Sea is acknowledg'd to be superiour to all the known World tho' all their Naval Strength was put together  Upon this Strength the Protestant Interest speaking of second Causes entirely depends this makes the Protestants formidable to the World this alone has restrain'd the Popish Powers of the World from overrunning them many Ages ago Farther than this it may not be unnecessary to reflect what Blows the Protestant Interest has already received in these or Years past how much weaker it is by Consequence than it was before and thereby how unable to resist the Effects of new Enemies if join'd together much more how little need there is to have yet deeper Wounds made in their Interest than was before These things are evident in the following Particulars  The Extirpation of the Protestants of  France  The Succession of the Roman Catholick House of  Newburgh  to the  Palatinate  The going over of the Elector of  Saxony  to the Romish Church  The weakening and oppressing the King of  Sweden  and divesting the  Swedes  who are Guarrantees of the Treaty of  Westphalia  of their Dominions in the Empire  The Danger of a Popish Successor to the Crowns of  Great Britain  and  Ireland  In considering these Things what Reflections must needs follow to any one who  with an impartial Eye and a just Concern for the Protestant Interest can look on the approaching Danger of a bloody War between  Great Britain  and the  States General  what a mortal Wound this would be to the Protestant Interest What a Breach it would make in the Protestant Strength and how effectually it would expose the Protestant Cause to be overrun by the Arms and Interest of the Popish Princes who we have always found ready to devour them  Let those who want Examples to illustrate this look back upon the Year when this Nation gull'd by the Arts and Politicks of Popish Councils was drawn in to fight against the  Dutch  How did it open a way to all those terrible Conquests which the  French  King made upon the  Dutch  by which he was within a Trifle of dissolving their State and uniting them all to the Kingdom of  France  and by which we had like at that time to have overwhelm'd the Protestant Religion in the World And in a Word by which this Nation also was at last brought to such a Desperate Point that had not the Revolution fallen in to rescue us from the Danger we had fallen into the Ballance of Power on the Popish Side and had help'd to outweigh the Protestants to their universal Destruction This may serve to warn us all from falling into the like Blindness of Measures and nothing is more wonderful than to find our People so willing to run into it  What can our falling upon the  Dutch  at this time imply What can the Effect of it be Will it not be an immediate weakening of them in their Defence of the Protestant Religion and a direct strengthing their Enemies to destroy them And will it not be an effectual weakening of us also so as at last perhaps to render us both too weak to do that tho' join'd together which either of us are able to do now apart in Defence of what is the mutual Interest of both  Add to this how both Nations are already exhausted and emptied by the long and continu'd Burthen of this heavy and expensive War that as it has been these Years dreining us it will require twice that time at least to restore and recover us So that we are in a much worse Condition to waste one another farther since it will of course so entirely expend our Strength and Capacity for our mutual Defence that it must render both Sides an easie Prey to the Enemy as is happily express'd by the Fable of the two small Birds who having been long fighting together the Eagle came and snatch'd away both  Let every considering Protestant summon his Reason and in the most affectionate manner persuade the Nations if it be possible to avoid so dangerous a Step as this which has a direct Tendency to destroy the Protestant Interest in the World and which cuts off the Hands that should defend it let them consider how the Enemies of our Religion would rejoice how they would promise  themselves from these Divisions and Distractions among Protestants that one time or other they should break in and devour the whole Interest let them remember that the like Strife among Christians was the very thing that let  Mahomet  the Great into  Europe  and gave leisure and opportunity to the Barbarians to overthrow the Remains of the  Grecian  Empire take  Constantinople  and plant themselves and their  Pagan  Superstition on the Ruins of the flourishing Christian Churehes This was the time the famous City of  Constantinople  was taken and the Emperor  Constantine  slain in it after a long Siege by the  Turks  Not one of the Christian Princes of  Europe  sending the least Help or stirring one Foot to the Assistance of the Christian Emperor who lost his Life in the Storm of the City not that the Christian Powers of  Europe  were not able to have reliev'd the City and to have driven the  Turk  out of  Europe  but they were universally embroil'd in furious Wars against one another  France  was just rescuing its self out of the Hands of the  English  under the weak and divided Reign of  Henry  th and  Germany  was embroil'd in Wars between the Emperor  Fredrick  and the Pope by which Means every Hand was employ'd and that Power which should have protected the Christian Interest was weaken'd to that Degree that the Christians were in no Condition to oppose the victorious  Turks  but let them quietly overrun a great part of  Europe  I would have all those who are desirous of  engaging these two  Protestant Nations  in a War one with another read that melancholy Story and consider how exactly this would be the Case between  Papists  and  Protestants  Let them consider what Depredations the  Popish  Powers of  Europe  would make on the  Protestant  Princes during such a time Let them examin in what Posture we should be to protect the  Protestant  Interest in Case of any Excursion of its  Popish  Enemies how it would lessen the Figure the  Protestants  now make weaken their Hands render them Contemptible to their Enemies and lay them open to the Attempts of those who have been hitherto restrained only by fear from devouring them  Nor would Victory on either hand mend it for the Protestant Interest being coucerned but as one Body in the whole Quarrel would equally suffer which Side soever obtained the Victory and this leads me to the Third Head  viz  III It must be a War in which the greatest Success will be a Loss to Us  It will be to no purpose for any Side to boast of Victory in this War since their very Conquest is their Loss and they are just so much weaker in the  Protestant Cause  as by their Conquest they have weaken'd their Brethren since in their Common Interest they are but one Body and have but one  Strength one Interest and one Foundation upon which they stand it is very unhappy that these things cannot pierce a little into our Thoughts but that we are all intent at such a time as this either on pushing on a War or settling a particular Peace and leaving the Views and Prospects of establishing  Europe  we are turning our Eyes upon a Breach with our Protestant Allies I do not desire to concern the present Debates among Us about War and Peace in this Matter I have nothing to do with who  directly  or who  consequently  push on a War with the  Dutch  but directing my Speech to both Parties I would faithfully represent to them the Ruin and Distress that such a War would bring upon the  Protestant Interest  in general how which Side soever get the better  Popery  alone gains by the Victory every Battle fought weakens the very Conqueror as  Protestant  as much as it does those that are beaten This is what I would move them to do that they may if possible find out some happy Medium either on one Side or other I do not undertake here to say what but  I say  some happy Medium to prevent the giving up the  Protestant Cause  to be devoured by the  Popish Tyrants  of the World that  Protestants  may not whet their Swords against one another as they already do their Tongues in a Dreadful and Implacable manner That they would remember every Drop of Blood they shed in this Quarrel leaves them just so much the less to oppose against  Popish  Power when that Day  shall come  as undoubtedly it will  when the Fate of the whole  Protestant Interest  may be try'd by the Sword and the Forces of all  Europe  shall be divided in a  Religious War  I can compare this unhappy Case of a War between  Britain  and  Holland  to nothing so well as to the War between the Children of  Israel  against their Brethren of the Tribe of  Benjamin  This is remarkable for the fury of it as appears in the Tribes Swearing binding one another by an Oath or a great Oath as the Text hath it That every Man that came not up to the Lord at  Mizpeth  that is to fight against  Benjamin  should be put to Death and another Oath they had also made  viz  That they would not any of them give their Daughters to a  Benjamite  The Story is too well known to repeat the Particulars the War was carry'd on with great Fury and was very bloody as such Wars always are it was so bloody that they spared neither Age Sex or Condition no nor the very Cattle but burnt down all their Cities and all that came to hand  Judg  So that the Tribe of  Benjamin  was entirely cut off only Six Hundred Men being left alive of the whole Race And what Joy had  Israel  of this Victory they had no sooner done it but see the Title or Contents of the next Chapter  The People bewail the Desolation of Benjamin  vide Mr  Pool  's Annotations and Contents on  Judges  xxi  Next see the manner of their bewailing it  And the People came to the House of God and abode there till even before God and lift up their voices and wept sore And said O LORD God of Israel why is this come to pass in Israel that there shonld be to day one Tribe lacking in Israel And it came to pass on the morrow that the People rose early and built there an Altar and offered Burnt Offerings and Peace Offerings  And again  v    And the Children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their Brother and said There is one tribe cut off from Israel this Day  See here the mournful Satisfaction of Victory over our Friends what is the English of it but this  There is one Tribe cut off from Israel  That is should  we now  be invaded by the  Heathen  by the  Canaanites  the  Philistines  or the  Midianites  or any of the Barbarous Nations there is one Tribe less to help defend the Borders of  Israel  Our Brethren of  Benjamin  are cut off and we are left naked on that Side we are just so much the weaker by our Victory  How exactly does this answer to the Case before us Should either Side prevail should we beat should we conquer the  Dutch  should the Heathen  French  fall in upon them and overrun them entirely  as in    they had almost done by our infatuated Assistance  what would be our Joy in this Conquests Should we not reflect on our selves after it and  repent our selves for Benjamin  Should we not say  why is this come to pass among  Protestants  that a Tribe or Nation of  Protestants  is  now lacking in Israel  Should we not lament for  Benjamin  that a Tribe was cut off from the  Protestant  Strength  On the other Hand should this War fall heavy on Us and though Ruin is what we pretend not to fear yet might it not so weaken us as to expose us an easy Prey to the  Pretender  and his Party which would be the worst sort of Ruin would not the  Dutch  themselves and the whole Body of the Protestants of  Europe Bewail the Desolation of Benjamin  and repent them for having lost a Tribe from the  Protestant Israel  Let all those as well of one Side or other who are either hasty for or indifferent in the Case of a War with the  Dutch  look into these Things and consider seriously what they are doing consider the Consequence of a War in which whether conquering or conquered the Interest of the Protestant Religion suffers and the Strength of the Protestant Powers is weakned and we shall all have Cause to bewail the Desolation of our Brethren  IV This War will be dangerous to the Protestant Succession  By the Protestant Succession I suppose all Men will understand me to mean the Succession of the House of  Hannover  to the Crowns of  Great Britain  and  Ireland  after the Demise of Her Present Majesty QUEEN  ANNE  and I have good Reason from the Iniquity of the Times  wherein Jacobite Distinctions  are very subtle and many  to make this Explanation Now let any Man but seriously examine the Consequences of a War with the Guarrantees of that Succession and what will he infer but that however intentionally it may not be so yet effectually and eventually it will be a War against the  Succession  it self not that I enter here into the Case whether the Guarrantee of the  Dutch  were necessary as was thought by way of Treaty Let that be as it will this is certain That the  Dutch  as a Protestant State Ally'd in Interest to both  viz  to the House of  Hannover  and to the  British  Nation and their own Safety absolutely requiring that this Nation should never come into  Popish  Hands are an undoubted Natural Security to the Protestant Succession and unless their Power be broken by such a War as this must be supposed always to be ready by a natural Consequence to assist and support the said Succession and all the Friends of it with all their Might they can do no other if they are not like us infatuated and blind to their own Safety and Interest nor is this the least part of our Security against the  Pretender  and all the  Jacobite  Enemies of the said Protestant Succession especially those of them who are Abroad  Those then who propagate whether openly or clandestinely a Breach between the Two Nations are so far real Enemies to the  Hannover  Succession let their Views and Designs Measures or Pretences be what they will such while they cry out Zealously  for the Protestant Succession would do well to tell Us how shall the Elector of  Hannover  support his Right How shall he come over hither with Forces and Armies in case of a contending  Pretender  who may be privately convey'd hither before him How shall he recover the Possession or come to the Assistance of his Friends and their Interest who may be oppress'd by a  Jacobite  Faction if the  Dutch  are ruin'd and their Naval Strength broken by that very Natition they should come to save  A War with  Holland  would in many respects therefore be a War against the Protestant Succession as well as against the Protestant Religion nay some who have examin'd that Affair very nicely affirm with me That there is indeed  no other real Danger  of the  Hannover  Succession but the ruining the  Dutch  for that whatever the Artifice of Parties may bring to pass and however the  High flying  and  Jacobite  Party in League with  France  and other  Popish  Powers may form a Conjunction of Interest so as to erect the Pretender nay tho' they were to set him upon the Throne yet that there will always be such a Body of the best the wisest and the most considerable People of this Nation steady to the Interest of the House of  Hannover  and firm to the Solemn Abjuration they have made of the  Pretender  that on the first appearance of the Protestant Successor with any reasonable Force to support them they would show themselves able to overthrow all their Enemies and restore  the Nation to the Right Establish'd Successor in spight of all the Opposition that the Enemies of the Protestant Interest could make But if the  Dutch  before this should be oppressed by a War and their Naval Strength and Power broken by us in vain we may stretch out our Hands to the Successor for help who cannot without a Fleet yield us that Assistance or do himself that Justice which otherwise he is very well able to do so that fighting against the  Dutch  is cutting off the Righthand of the Succession On the other hand should the Forces of  Britain  be broken or weaken'd in this War against the  Dutch  still so much the less able we shall be to resist the Efforts of the  Pretender  whether he comes back't by a  French  or a  Spanish  Power or depending upon the Interest of his  Jacobite  Friends and Faction at Home a Nation exhausted impoverish'd and tyr'd out with War cannot be in so good a Condition to resist an Invader nor so warmly inclin'd to engage in a new War against Tyranny and Oppression as while we are whole and in Condition so that which way soever we take this War and which way soever the Success of a  Dutch  War shall fall it will be Dangerous if not Fatal to the Protestant Succession of the House of  Hannover  V It must be a War fatal many ways to Us who are engag'd in it  This besides what relates as before to the Protestant Interest and the  Hannover  Succession will be consider'd as it respects our Commerce our publick Credit our exhausted Circumstances and our general Civil Interest what relates to Commerce has been touch'd at already and I may only add this that as our Trade in general is already prodigiously sunk by the long Interruption of Years War the Damage of which will not in some Ages  if Ever  be wholly repair'd So a War with  Holland  at this time would give such a Blow to that Part which remains that in general our whole Trade would be overwhelmed in Difficulties and Confusions inextricable the Employment of the Poor by the Stop and Interruption of Commerce in the present Wars has in several Parts of  England  been quite stopt in others they are taken off of the Manufactures they were originally bred to So that whole Towns remain now Destitute of so much as the appearance of those Manufactures they were formerly wholly taken up with our Colonies Abroad by the stop of the Consumption and Exportation of their Produce occasion'd by the War are oblig'd to leave Planting as in  Virginia  in particular and apply themselves to Manufactures by which in a few Years the supply of Woollen Manufactures which usually was sent from hence will be effectually stopp'd All these and many more will be encreased by a War with the  Dutch  to whom including  Hamburgh  at this time we export  more of our Woolen Manufactures than to all Parts of the World besides tho' put together  What then shall be the Condition of our People when as before the Export of our Broad Cloth Kersies Serges and Stuffs of which the  Dutch  now receive such great Quantities shall be stop'd and when the poor People who now live upon those Employments shall be destitute of Work and be left to seek their Bread Let those People that think a War with  Holland  of no Consequence consider of some Equivalent for this and of opening some Trade for the vent of our Manufactures which shall sufficiently supply the Poor with Labour and raise Money effectually to pay them  If these Things were consider'd we should be more cautious as well of coveting to make a War with the  Dutch  as of pleasing our selves with the Hopes that the  Dutch  will force us to it  I shall not touch at the Consequences which some have already spoken to in case the  Dutch  and the  Emperor  pushing on the War without Us should reduce  France  and and recover  Spain  not only without any Assistance from Us but even against our Will the many ways this may be fatal to Us are better thought of in private than made publick and it is hoped the Prudence of our Allies may avoid pushing us to those Extremeties But I cannot omit mentioning again tho' spoken to before how evidently such a War would open a Door to  the Pretender  and  expose these Nations as a Prey to the  Jacobite  Interest as well at Home as Abroad for as some Men hope so I cannot but see that in case of a War with the  Dutch  the Attempts of the  Jacobite Party  will be inevitable nor can they be so blind to their own Interest as not to know it and this is the true Reason that you cannot converse at this Time with a  Jacobite  but you discover his most Passionate Desire of a War with the  Dutch  all their Emissaries are busie Exclaiming against the  Dutch  and Exasperating our People against the  Dutch  and if the  StatesGeneral  do stand out against the  British  Measures or take any Step that seems a little disobliging these Men far from doing Justice on either Hand set all their Emissaries at Work to aggravate it and make it appear worse than really it is On the other Hand the same Party in  Holland  act the very other Extreme and there they exclaim against the  British  Measures tell the  Dutch  they are Maltreated that the  British  Parliament has used them barbarously That the  British  Ministry impose upon them and cram the Peace down their Throats and the like The Reason is evident they seek nothing but a Breach because they see clearly that a War is the only Step that can make way for their Interest and open a Door to the Pretender  VI It must be a War against the General Inclination of the People  This seems to want no Proof even the Queen herself and the Ministry however it may seem are averse to it and the Measures taken with the  Dutch  however Calculated to carry on the Peace with the  French  have plainly discover'd that it is not the Inclination of the Ministry to break with the  Dutch  if they can avoid it they cannot but see that it will be  Ruinous to our Trade  and that the  Burthens  must be intollerable that must follow especially our present Impoverish'd Circumstances consider'd Nor can it be Reasonable that the Ministry who give the Exhausted Condition of the Nation as the best and first Reason for making a Peace with  France  should at the same Time be so regardless of that exhausted Condition of the Nation as to lead them into a War with  Holland  this would be to deny what they had alledg'd before and Contradict what was the main Argument given for Convincing us of the Necessity of former Measures  viz  That the Nation was Reduced Exhausted Impoverish'd and the like and that some Ages were requir'd to restore our Circumstances and this was acknowledg'd in many Cases to be true but the People will of course think themselves banter'd and jested with in all that if we think fit now to run into another War which may be every way as fatal and as chargeable as the other  As to the Inclination of the common People that has many Ways been try'd the Aversions that formerly were in our People  against a  Dutch  War were too well known to those who observ'd it  viz  with what Backwardness they Engag'd with what Reluctance they Listed how the poor Seamen were dragg'd into the Service like a Bear to the Stake It would be too long to enter upon the Reasons and Considerations which moved this Aversion the Thing speaks itself they have been long our Friends and Confederates have often Assisted Relieved Deliver'd Us in our Embroiled Circumstances and we cannot without Reluctance desire to fight against a People whom we have so often acted in Conjunction with We have look'd upon them as our Friends as our Brethren in the late War and it must be with Regret that our People should rejoyce in contrary Extremes and sheath their Swords in the Bowels of those who they shook Hands with before  Trade our mutual Converse in Business and the long Interwoven Interests of the two Nations cannot but Contribute to this Inclination and the Damage we shall feel and that immediately too will assist to form the Aversions which are in our Minds against the War and make our People abhorr the Thoughts of it but I need not insist upon this which every Man knows to be Fact and can trace the Original of I come now to consider the two last Articles  viz  VII That it will be a War in which we are very likely to have the Disadvantage  Not that I am of the Opinion that the  Dutch  will beat Us as some People talk and yet farther from pleasing myself with the Hopes of it as some pretend we do but if as before we shall be Losers even by the Success we may pretend to have in it what then must be the want of that Success if such a Case also should happen Let those who calmly Examin Things at all look back on the Stop of Trade Loss of Shipping Ruin of Merchants want of Employ for our People mention'd before in this Tract and judge for themselves as to the Advantages to Us but if we should have the worst of it at Sea also as no Man can Answer for the uncertain Events of War if our Navy should be Defeated our Ships which are our Strength receive any fatal Blow which we are not sure of the Disadvantages which will follow to us are such as I shall in hopes they will never happen conceal for the present  Lastly  No more shall I think to terrifie any from a War with the  Dutch  by telling them it will not be a War to be Trifled with that the  English  and  Dutch  when they used to meet at Sea do not use to make a Jest of it fighting with the  Dutch  has always had a difference in it from fighting with other Nations These fight at a distance and lie and pelt one another while they are a quarter of a Mile or half a Mile off or pour in their small  Shot upon one another to pick off their Men but when the  English  and  Dutch  formerly used to meet three Sea fights have been fought with near Sail of a side in one Summer the great Deck Ships of Guns each sink and burn by one another's Side and the Squadrons lie YardArm and YardArm pouring in their CrossBar Double Head and Round and tearing one another with that dreadful Fury that nothing on Earth can be spoken of to describe those Sea fights by let those who remember the last  Holland  Wars tell us whether the hottest Action we have had at Sea during this War can be compar'd to the Way of fighting between Us and the  Dutch  And there is no Question to be made but the like must follow again if a New War begin This seems evident that the Animosity between the Nations is like to be as great as ever and perhaps greater and the War if such a miserable Event should follow will be Prosecuted with the greatest Fury that any War ever was between Us  Having thus laid down the Consequences of such a War it cannot be thought that any one in these Nations who is a Friend to the Protestant Succession to the Protestant Religion to the general Interest of the Protestant Powers to Trade to the Poor or indeed to themselves can desire to have these two Protestant Nations engag'd with one another especially at such a Time as this It is an invidious Task to go about here to make Enquiry who are or are not desirous of this War Or who among us may  by pushing on their separate Schemes bring it to pass by the Consequence of these Schemes whether involuntarily or otherwise it is too evident where this lies to need an Enquiry but as I have made this Piece hitherto independent and look neither way as to Parties so it seems not at all needful The Advice is to both or all our Parties that they would consider very well what they are doing what Interest they are carrying on whose alone will be the Advantage to whom will be the Joy of such a War For if these are our Dangers and if all these Disadvantages threaten us by a War with the  Dutch  it cannot be but that a Proportion of Gain and Advantage will accrue to the Enemy for what is our Loss must on the other Hand be their Advantage  I know and easily foresee many Things will be objected here and it may be necessary to speak to them all in their Order tho' our Space at the end of this Work is too short to say all that might be spokenThe Objections are such as these  viz  Tho' it be true that the Consequences of a War with  Holland  are as you have said yet what must be done We are not to let the  Dutch  insult us because it is our Disadvantage so many ways to have War That if the  Dutch  reject the Measures proposed for their Advantage and Ours too and carry Things on to an extravagant Height THEY force the War and not WE That by doing what is incompatible with our  Interest they in Effect declare the War so that it is They make War with the QUEEN not the QUEEN with Them That the  Dutch  are acted by a Faction from hence who prompt and persuade them to stand out and put them in hopes that their doing so may bring Things to a new Turn here and put a new Face upon our Affairs and that all these Things push the present Ministry upon the necessity of taking the Measures they now pursue to preserve the present Government and if the  Dutch  join with a Party here who oppose Her Majesty's just Measures they bring the War upon themselves and that Party here are the Cause and ought to bear the Blame of the War and of all the Inconveniences and Damages that may follow  It is not my Work here to argue for or against the Parties as I said before I am rather for giving all the Latitude to the Objectors on either Hand and therefore I willingly for Argumentssake allow all the Objection but without entring into the Merit of the Case on the one Side or the Other the Consequences of the War not the Necessity of it is the present Argument before us  If there is a necessity for a War with the  Dutch  I am sorry for that unhappy Circumstance but without entring into a Dispute of the Fact my Draught of the Consequences lies as a Caution to all Parties to consider with the utmost Seriousness what that Necessity is and if possible to remove those  Causes which bring that Necessity on for if the Effects of a  Dutch  War are as before we ought to be very well satisfy'd that our Reasons for it are of sufficient Weight to ballance all the Evils that follow and if on a due Enquiry it should be found that these Necessities are of our own making and that we maliciously on both Sides push one another on to the Extremities which in their own nature procure this Mischief The Excuse of its being necessary will dwindle away into and plainly discover a wicked Plot to bring this War upon the Nation even for the sake of those very Mischiefs that so necessarily attend it  As to letting the  Dutch  insult us and putting the Cause of the War wholly upon them if this were true or should appear all that has been said will lye against the  Dutch  and not against Us and were I to write this in  Holland  I would perhaps be able to shew the  Dutch  how many ways a War with  Britain  may be fatal and dangerous to them as well as to us Us Many of the Arguments beforemention'd hold good on their Side as well as Ours The  Hannover  Succession is tho' something more remotely as much their Concern as Ours the Protestant Interest ought to lie as near their Hearts as ours The Interruptions of Commerce the Loss of Ships Trade and Goods These are Things they will bear their share of no Question with us If they gain by the War if they Beat us they will have as much Cause to mourn for  their Victory as We for our Loss and as the Author of the  Review  says very well  "The whole War is but the same thing as a Man cutting off his Left Hand with his Right"  The Advice is to them therefore  equally as to us  tho' not quite with the same Concern they ought to study all the Methods possible to avoid this Breach they ought to consider and duly weigh the General Protestant Interest and rather abate in some of their Demands for Peacesake and to avoid the threatning Danger In short both Nations and every Party or Faction in both Nations ought to consider well what they are doing and to what a desperate Condition the Protestant Interest will be reduced and nothing but such unavoidable necessity as will justify them before God and Man ought to be allow'd as a Reason for this War  I might descend here to other Particulars but as they seem to lead more directly into our present Party Disputes which in this Tract I purpose not to meddle with I omit them and choose to let this Animadversion respect every Side that if possible it may be useful to them all and may bring all Parties seriously to apply themselves if possible to heal this Breach now while it is young and before the Wound festers before it comes up to an Inflamation and Mortification when all the Endeavours will but encrease the Misery and be ineffectual to the Cure  It is our present Misfortune that our People on both Sides seem not to see into the Mischiefs of the present Case the Willingness on one Hand and the Unconcernedness at the Consequences on the other which unhappily appear among our People with respect to a War with  Holland  are very surprizing and it seems to me to signify that neither of the Parties have duly weigh'd the thing These Sheets are written that they may not want a Light to see by in this Case nor plead Ignorance of the Effects when they may have brought them upon us too late  As to those who profess it their Design to overthrow the present Settlement of this Nation I mean the Enemies of the  Revolution  the Friends of the  Pretender  the favourers of  Popery  and  Tyranny  these Sheets are not written for their Conviction I do not so much reproach them with desiring a War with the  Dutch  because it seems the only way to bring all their Desires to pass  But this may be drawn from thence as a most direct Consequence  viz  That the present Popular Cry against the  Dutch  is a sad Token of the Growth and Encrease of  Jacobitism  among Us and of the growing Interest of the  Pretender  FINIS  ERRATA  PAG    The General Heads  III and VI  being transposed The Reader is desired to take Notice thereof and read the one for the other
