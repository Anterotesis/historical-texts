 portrait  PIGS' MEAT OR LESSONS FOR THE  SWINISH MULTITUDE  PUBLISHED IN WEEKLY PENNY NUMBERS  Collected by the Poor Man's Advocate an old Veteran in the Cause of Freedom in the Course of his Reading for more than Twenty Years  INTENDED To promote among the Labouring Part of Mankind proper Ideas of their Situation of their Importance and of their Rights  AND TO CONVINCE THEM That their forlorn Condition has not been entirely overlooked and forgotten nor their just Cause un∣pleaded neither by their Maker nor by the best and most enlightened of Men in all Ages  For the Needy shall not alway be forgotten the Ex∣pectation of the Poor shall not perish for ever  PSALM ix ver  The Heaven even the Heavens are the Lords but the Earth hath he given to the Children of Men  PSALM cxv ver  VOLUME II  LONDON PRINTED FOR T SPENCE AT THE HIVE OF LIBER∣TY NO LITTLE TURNSTILE HIGH HOLBORN  Wherefore seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and let us run with patience the race that is set before us  HEB xii ver  ALTERATION  NO longer lost in shades of night  Where late in chains we lay  The sun arises and his light  Dispels our gloom away  No longer blind and prone to lye  In slavery profound  But for redress aloud we cry  And Tyrants hear the sound  The pomp of Courts  no more  engage  The  magic spell  is  broke  We hail the bright reforming age  And  cast away  the  yoke  Our  substance  and our  blood  no more  So tamely shall we yield  Nor quit like slaves our  native  shore  To  deck  the MONSTER'S field  The  rotten lumber  of the land  The  courtlypension'd train  Shall hear their sentence and disband  As we our Rights regain  The mitred villain as he rolls  In luxury and lust  He blinds and robs the silly souls  Committed to his trust  Amus'd no more with empty lies  Of bliss we  never  knew  The traitors lose the state disguise  And closely we pursue  THE RIGHT AND CAPACITY OF THE PEO∣PLE TO JUDGE OF GOVERNMENT  From  CATO'S LETTERS  HONESTY and plainness go together and the makers and multipliers of mysteries in the political way are shrewdly to be suspected of dark de∣signs  Cincinatus  was taken from the plough to save and defend the  Roman  State an office which he executed honestly and successfully without the grimace and gains of a statesman Nor did he afterwards continue obsti∣nately at the head of affairs to form a party raise a fortune and settle himself in power As he came into it with universal consent he resigned it with universal applause  It seems that government was not in those days become a trade at least a gainful tradehonest  Cin∣cinatus  was but a farmer and happy had it been for the  Romans  if when they were enslaved they could have taken the administration out of the hands of the emperors and their refined politicians and com∣mitted it to such farmers or any farmers It is certain that many of their imperial governors acted more ridiculously than a board of ploughmen would have done and more barbarously than a club of butchers could have done  But some have said  it is not the business of private men to meddle with government  A bold false and dishonest saying and whoever say it either knows not what he says or cares not or slavishly speaks the sense of others It is a cant now almost forgot in England and which never prevailed but when liberty and the constitution were attacked and never can prevail but upon the like occasion  It is a vexation to be obliged to answer nonsense and confute absurdities  but since it is and has been the great design of this paper to maintain and explain the  glorious principles of liberty and to expose the arts of those who would darken or destroy them I shall here particularly shew the wickedness and stupidity or the above saying which is fit to come from no m  ath but that of a tyrant or a slave and can never be h  d by any man of an honest and free soul with∣out ho  and indignation It is in short a saying which ought to  ender the man who utters it for ever incapable of place or credit in a free country as it shews the m  lignity of his heart and the baseness of his nature and as it is the pronouncing of a doom upon our constitutiona crime or rather a compli∣cation of crimes for which a lasting infamy ought to be but part of the punishment  But to the falshood of the thing Public truths ought never to be kept secrets and they who do it are guilty of a solecism and a contradiction Every man ought to know what it concerns all to know Now nothing upon earth is of a more universal na∣ture th  n government and every private man upon ea  ch has a concern in it because in it is concerned and nearly and immediately concerned his virtue his p  erty and the security of his person And where all these are best  eserved and advanced the government is best adm  istred and where they are not the government is impotent wicked or unfor∣tu    d where the government is so the people  there being always and every where a cer∣tain sympathy and analogy  etween the nature of the government and the nature of the pe  ple This holds true in every instance Public men  re the patterns of private and the virtues and vices of the governors become quickly the virtues and vices of the go∣verned  Nor is it example alone that does it Ill govern∣ments su  si  ting by vice and rapine are jealous of private virtue and enemies to private property Th  must be wicked and mischievous to be what they are not are they secure while any thing good  and valuable is secure Hence it is that to drain worry and debauch their subjects are the steady maxims of their politics their favourite arts of reigning In this wretched situation the people to be safe must be poor and lewd there will be but little industry where property is precarious small honesty where virtue is dangerous  Profuseness or frugality and the like virtues or vices which affect the public will be practised in the city if they be practised in the court and in the country if they be in the city Even  Nero  that royal monster in man's shape was adored by the common herd at  Rome  as much as he was flattered by the great and both the little and the great ad∣mired or pretended to admire his manners and many to imitate them  Tacitus  tells us that those sort of people long lamented him and rejoiced in the choice of a successor that resembled him even the profligate  Otho  Good government does on the contrary pro∣duce great virtue much happiness and many peo∣ple  Greece  and  Italy  while they continued free were each of them for the number of inhabitants like one continued city for virtue knowledge and great men they were the standards of the world and that age and country that could come nearest to them has ever since been reckoned the happiest Their government their free government was the root of all these advantages and of all this felicity and renown and in these great and fortunate states the people were the principals in the govern∣ment laws were made by their judgment and au∣thority and by their voice and commands were ma∣gistrates made and condemned The city of  Rome  could conquer the world nor could the great  Persian  Monarch the greatest then upon earth stand before the face of one  Greek  City  But what are  Greece  and  Italy  now  Rome  has in it a herd of pampered monks and a few starving lay  inhabitants the  Campania  of  Rome  the finest spot of earth in  Europe  is a desart And for the modern  Greeks  they are a few abject contemptible slaves kept under ignorance chains and vileness by the  Turkish  Monarch who keeps a great part of the globe intensely miserable that he may seem great without being so  Such is the difference between one government and another and of such important concernment is the nature and administration of government to a people And to say that private men have nothing to do with government is to say that private men have nothing to do with their own happiness and misery  One man or a few men have often pretended the public and meant themselves and consulted their own personal interest in instances essential to its wellbeing but the whole people by con∣sulting their own interest consult the public and act for the public by acting for themselves this is particularly the spirit of our constitution in which the whole nation is represented and our records afford instances where the house of commons have declined entering upon a question of importance till they had gone into the country and consulted their principles the people so far were they from think∣ing that private men had no right to meddle with government In truth our whole worldly happiness and misery abating for accidents and diseases are owing to the order and mismanagement of govern∣ment and he who says that private men have no concern with government does wisely and modestly tell us that men have no concern in that which con∣cerns them most it is saying that people ought not to concern themselves whether they be naked or clothed fed or starved deceived or instructed and whether they be protected or destroyed What non∣sense and servitude in a  free  and  wise  nation  For myself who have thought pretty much on these matters I am of opinion that a whole nation are like to be as much attached to themselves as one man or a few men are like to be who may be many means be detached from the interest of a nation It is certain that one man and several men may be bribed into an interest opposite to that of the public but it is as certain that a whole country can never find an equi∣valent for itself and consequently  a whole country can never be bribed  It is the eternal interest of every nation that their government should be good but they who direct it frequently reason a contrary way and find their own account in plunder and oppression and while the public voice is pretended to be de∣clared by one or a few for vile and private ends the public knows nothing what is done till they feel the terrible effects of it  By the Bill of Rights and the Act of Settlement at the  Revolution  a right is asserted to the people of applying to the King and to the parliament by peti∣tion and address for a redress of public grievances and mismanagements when such there are of which They are left to judge and the difference between free and enslaved countries lies principally here that in the former their magistrates must consult the voice and interest of the people but in the latter the private will interest and pleasure of the governors are the sole end and motives of their administration  Such is the difference between  England  and  Turky  which difference they who say that private men have no right to concern themselves with government would absolutely destroy they would convert ma∣gistrates into bashaws and introduce popery into politics The late revolution stands upon the  very opposite maxim and that any man dares to contra∣dict it since the  Revolution  would be amazing did we not know that there are in every country hire∣lings who would betray it for a sop  A DREAM REQUIRING NO INTERPRETER  Were I who to my cost already am  One of those strange prodigious creatures man  A spirit free to chuse for my own share  What case of flesh and blood I'd please to wear  I'd be a dog a monkey or a bear  Or any thing but that vain animal  Who is so proud of being rational  ROCH  To the  PRINTER  of the  SHEFFIELD REGISTER  SIR  HOW disgusting is a state of society when we observe men either tearing one another in pieces by violence or taking every unjust means to undermine each other by cunning and treachery each acts as if his  only  aim were the total extirpation of his species how shocking the idea that of all the animals scattered over this vast globe man is the most ferocious  Seldom or never do we see the most savage ani∣mals wage war with those of the same kind that is a refinement in cruelty of which man only is ca∣pable What a misfortune that the social state to which man is from nature prone and which in its own nature is adapted to give us the compleatest happiness this life is capable of should be so uncom∣fortable and fail so often of its designed effects But what else is to be expected while people are so unwise in their choice of those who are to be the protectors of society expecting happiness from the management of those incapable of giving ithow oft do we see those inmuman  monsters  no sooner in power than merely to satisfy their ambition madly  hurry mankind into all the horrors of desolating war seeming eager to destroy that society they but a few months before nay perhaps but a few days sword to be the guardian ofThese serious reflections having a few nights ago taken possession of my mind before going to sleep raised in my imagination the following dream  Methought I was transported to a large plain green flowery and watered with innumerable rivulets whose gentle murmurs formed an agreeable concert with the sweet notes of songsters which flut∣tered upon their verdant banksThe inhabitants of this delightful place were divided into a number of different societies each governed by its own par∣ticular monarchAs I was walking among them observing their manners and customs which I found were quite different notwithstanding their near con∣nection between some only a slight barrier others had even but small rivulets to fix their boundaries I was much surprised to see them constantly wrang∣ling and engaged in quarrels sometimes for the least trifle such as the  ducks  of one district swim∣ming in a  pool  belonging to another or perhaps to satisfy the foolish caprice of some of the  great men  for in each society was a great number who were called  Satellites  of their respective crowns who as other secondary planets derive their lustre from some primary planet so they received their authority from the crown and dispensed it to the people without the least diminution I was equally surprised at the  an∣dacity  of the one and the  passive  obedience of the other But my wonder somewhat abated when I saw their different manner of handling a controversy the multitude wholly unacquainted with the wiles of logic had nothing to support their cause but a parcel of phrases and words now entirely obsolete such as  reason humanity  and  justice  with a long list of anti∣quated etceteras whereas on the other side the  mo∣narchs  and their  jack  lls  had a notable way of arguing  namely by  torture whips racks gibbets gallies dun∣g  and many other syllogisms of the same kind This manner of  persuasion  or rather  compulsion  may pro∣perly be called the  logic of tyrants  Pain they main∣tained was much better for clearing the understand∣ing than reason the latter actuating but slowly whilst the other was almost instantaneous Having walked a little further I gained a small spot entirely surrounded by water here thought I  Peace  must have her residence no longer shall my ears be grated with the horrid din of war my eyes shall not here behold the tears of the widow with her children clung round her bewailing the loss of a fond husband and tender father torn by force from their arms But guess my astonishment at finding them the most litigious and quarrelsome party I had yet met with and though they boasted of being free were so  only  in idea I wondered much how they were so easily duped seeing no force used not so much as a threat they were even said to have the reins of Government in their own hands and allowed to drive at pleasure But their Monarch took a safer way of arguing them out of their liberties though not less sure than that practised in the other societies through which I pas∣sedI mean convincing by ready money or as some call it  bribing a man to an opinion  Experience has proved this to be the most effectual method  Argu∣ments from the mint  will persuade much sooner than those drawn from  reason  and  philosophy  Gold is a wonderful clearer of the understanding It satisfies every doubt in an instant silences the clamorous stops the mouth of the orator brings over the most inflexible statesman and in short is capable of argu∣ing men out of all their liberties  Wishing to see one of these  supernatural beings  called  monarchs  I advanced towards a palace which stood at a little distance At the gate was placed a number of guards cloathed with all the tawdry pomp of power in order to strike with awe the  beholders They permitted me to pass into a large hall the walls thereof were gilded all for show At the upper end of the hall was a throne supported by magical contrivance upon a few  gothic pillars  On one pillar I observed the word  superstition  on another  divine right  These two were in many places nearly mouldered to pieces so that the throne actu∣ally tottered and must have fallen had it not been supported by a third pillar of that fascinating metal called  gold  whose lustre dazzled the eyes of most of the beholders to such a degree that they were un∣able to observe either the inscriptions or defects of the other two The throne was covered with a canopy which glittered with all the riches which pomp could invent Under it sat DESPOTISM arrayed in all the gorgeous trappings of  arrogance  and  power Folly  ho∣vered around his crown ambition sat like a spread eagle on the top of his scepter and vanity supported the skirt of his train At the foot of the throne sat  Flattery  giving her colours and complexions to every thing around beside her sat  Error  deluding the multitude and striving to conceal whatever defects might appear Many other  phantoms  stalked round the hall amongst whom was  Honour  with nothing on but an old  coat  the atchievment of some of his ancestors there was also  Ostentation  holding up his head and strutting about on tiptoe Near the prince's right hand stood  Selfconceit  frowning on those who did not bow before him  After gratifying my curiosity and turning to leave the place I perceived a bustle at the door and was not a ittle startled at seeing  Broken Credit Shame Poverty Ruin Scorn  and many others of their ac∣quaintance force their way into the hall notwith∣standing the resistance of the guards Wondering what would be the consequence I saw one who was an entire stranger here a grave decent old man called PLAIN DEALING get up and harangue the multitude in the following terms  "Citizens  "We are oppressed because we have no share in our government Let us cease to petition for our rights let us blush to bend the knee and supplicate like beggars for what nature bequeathed to us at our birth Let us speak in a tone that virtuous go∣vernors will hear and tyrannical ones tremble at They tell us we have liberty yes two or three hundred citizens have the liberty of lording it over all the others of making and repealing laws at pleasure of engrossing dignities ranks and honours of investing themselves with the principal employ∣ments of the state and disposing of the public re∣venue  "Can liberty be applied to a people who have no part in the government of themselves or their repre∣sentatives We are no farther free than as we have a share in the administration and are a branch of the national council How intolerable to have insult added to slavery to be even challenged to prove our wrongs alas a task but too easy Are not many of our fellowcitizens shamefully excluded from all political trusts by acts which reward falsehood and punish honesty which usurp the dominion of that God whom they pretend to revere Are we not loaded with  taxes  which wring from the poor peasant great part of his hardearned pittance to support foolish and profligate wars entered into with all the madness of political  quixotsm  and which threaten our posterity with calamities unparalelled in any ageIs there not an increasing corruption in the administration of government is not the repre∣sentative house of the people become a chamber only for registering ministerial edicts has there not been every attempt made to silence that guardian of our libertythe press without which governors and their minions might with impunity trample on for∣malities the pretended bulwark of our freedom is not the equipoise in our legislature the mere cant  of visionary theorists In short is it not a govern∣ment of conspiracya conspiracy only to be removed by the force of popular opinion Are these imagi∣nary ills Do they seem chimerical on account of that security into which people seem to be lulled some by interest others by sear  "They pretend we have a constitution but nobody knows the mechanism of it The laws resemble a chaos jumbled into as many large volumes as would take a man during his life to read Except a few capital crimes as murder and theft we are not sensi∣ble when we trespass until the lawyers those  blood∣suckers  of society apprize us of it by process our sentence follows hard on the commission of it so that we are often punished for pretended crimes without ever knowing we were doing the least wrong There is no criterion whereby we can distinguish  laws  from  dictates that criterion being an expression of the general will  IS WANTING I would admonish our governors to reform before that fatal moment arri  es which is fast approaching when they shall be obliged to supplicate  that  people whom they  now  oppress and despise I shudder at the thought of that dreadful period when virtue and necessity shall compell us to insist upon that freedom we now design to sue for  Despotic government  has now lived its time The  Sun of Liberty  is arisen already the clouds that have long held the moral and political world in darkness begin to disperse and Reason like a flood of light begins to burst upon mankind"  The multitude at these words gave three huzzas which awoke me out of my reverie  I am c  EXAMPLES OF SAFE PRINTING  TO prevent

Powers  entered into an alliance offensive and defensive and were to live very soci∣ally together in the forest  not meaning in Europe  One day having made a sort of an excursion  not mean∣ing in

Esq  WHEN a Magistrate fancies he is not made for the people but the people for him that he does not govern for them but for himself that the people live only to encrease his glory or to furnish matter for his pleasure he does not enquire what he may  do for  them but what he may  draw from  them by this means he sets up an interest of profit pleasure or pomp in himself repugnant to the good of the public for which he is made to be what he is These contrary ends certainly divide the nation into parties and while every one endeavours to advance that to which he is addicted occasions of hatred for injuries every day do  e or thought to be  re∣ceived must necessarily arise This creaces a most s  er  e and irreconcilable enmity because the occasions are frequent important and universal and the causes thought to be most just The people think it to be the greatest of all crimes to convert that power to their h  t which was instituted for their good and that the injustice is aggravated by perjury and in∣gratitude which comprehend all manner of ill and the Magistrate gives the name of sedition and rebel∣lion to whatsoever they do for the preservation of themselves and their rights When men's spirits are thus prepared a small matter sets them on fire but if no acc  nt happens to bl  them into a flame the course of justice is certainly interrupted the public  its are neglected and when any occasion whether foreign or domestic arises in which the Magistrate stands in need of the people's assistance they whose affections are alienated not only shew an  to serve him with their persons and estates but fear that by delivering him from his distress they strong then their enemy and enable him  to oppress them and he fancying his will to be un∣justly opposed or his due more unjustly denied is filled with a dislike of what he sees and a fear of worse for the future Whilst he endeavours to ease himself of the one and to provide against the other he usually encreases the evils of both and jealousies are on both sides multiplied Every man knows that the governed are in a great measure under the power of the governor but as no man or number of men is willingly subject to those that seek their ruin such as fall into so great a misfortune continue no longer under it than force fear or necessity may be able to oblige them But such a necessity can hardly be longer upon a great people than till the evil be fully discovered and comprehended and their virtue strength and power be united to expell it The ill Magistrate looks upon all things that may conduce to that end as so many preparatives to his ruin and by the help of those who are of his party will endeavour to prevent that union and diminish that strength virtue power and courage which he knows to be bent against him And as truth faithful dealing and integrity of manners are bands of union and helps to good he will always by tricks artifices cavils and all means possible en∣deavour to establish falshood and dishonesty whilst other emissaries and instruments of iniquity by cor∣rupting the youth and such as can be brought to le  dness and debauchery bring the people to such a pass that they may neither care nor dare to vindi∣cate their rights and that those who would do it may so far suspect each other as not to confer upon much less to join in any action tending to the public deliverance  This distinguishes the good from the bad Magi∣strate the faithful from the unfaithful and those that adhere to either living in the same principle must wa  in the same ways They who uphold the rightful power of a just Magistracy encourage virtue  and justice and teach men what they ought to do suffer or expect from others they fix them upon principles of honesty and generally advance every thing that tend  to the encrease of the valour strength greatness and happiness of the nation creating a good anion among them and bringing every man to an enact understanding of his own and the public rights On the other side he that would introduce an ill Magistrate make one evil who was good or preserve him in the administration of injustice when he is corrupted must always open the way for him by vitiating the people corrupting their manners destroying the validity of oaths teaching such eva∣sions equivocations and fraud as are inconsistant with the thoughts that become men of virtue and courage and overthrowing the confidence they ought to have in each other make it impossible for them to unite amongst themselves The like arts must be used with the Magistrate He cannot be for their turns till he is persuaded to believe he has no dependence upon and owes no duty to the people that he is of himself and not by their institution that no man ought to enquire into nor be judge of his actions that all obedience is due to him whe∣ther he be good or bad wise or foolish a father or an enemy to his country This being calculated for his personal interest he must pursue the same designs or his kingdom is divided within itself and cannot subsist By this means those who flatter his hu∣m  ur court to be accounted his friends and the only men that are thought worthy of great trusts while such as are of another mind are exposed to all p  r  e  tion These are always such as excell in virtue wisdom and greatness of spirit They have eyes and they will always see the way they go and h  a  ing fools no be guided by implicit faith will distinguish between good and evil and chase that which is best they will judge of men by their actions and by them discovering whose servant every  man is know whether he is to be obeyed or nor Those who are ignorant of all good careless or enemies to it take a more compendious way their slavish vicious and base natures inclining them to seek only private and present advantage they easily slide into a blind dependence upon one who has wealth and power and desiring only to know his will care not what injustice they do if they may be rewarded They worship what they find in the temple though it be the vilest of idols and always like that best which is worst because it agrees with their inclinations and principles When a party comes to be erected upon such a foundation de∣bauchery lewdness and dishonesty are the true badges of it such as wear them are cherished but the principal marks of favour are reserved for them who are the most industrious in mischief either by seducing the people with the allurements of sensual pleasures or corrupting their understandings with false and slavish doctrines  On the  INJUSTICE  of a  NATION  conceiting itself the only  avourite People of Heaven  From a Pamphlet entitled  The Sins of the Nation  Being a  FASTDAY SERMON  THERE is a notion which has a direct tendency to make as unjust because it tends to make us think God is so I mean the idea which most nations have entertained that they are the peculiar favourites of Heaven  e nourish our pride by fondly fancy∣ing that we are the only nation for whom the pro∣vidence of God exerts itself th  only nation whose form of worship is agreeable to him the only nation whom he has endowed with a competent share of  wisdom to frame wise laws and rational governments Each nation is to itself the fleece of Gideon and drinks exclusively the dew of science but as God is no respecter of persons so neither is he of nations he has not like earthly monarchs his favouritesThere is a great deal even in our thanksgivings which is exceptionable on this account  God we thank thee that we are not like other nations  yet we surely load ourselves with every degree of guilt but then we like to consider  ourselves  as a child that is chidden and others as outcasts  When the workings of these bad passions are swel∣led to their height by mutual animosity and opposi∣tion  war  ensues War is a state in which all our feelings and our duties suffer a total and strange in∣version a state in which  "Lise dies Death lives and Nature breeds  Perverse all monstrous all prodigious things"  A state in which it becomes our business to hurt and annoy our neighbour by every possible means instead of cultivating to destroy instead of building to pull down instead of peopling to depopulate a state in which we drink the tears and feed upon the misery of our fellowcreatures such a state therefore re∣quires the extremest necessity to justify it it ought not to be the common and usual state of society As both parties cannot be in the right there is always an equal chance at least to either of them of being in the wrong but as both parties may be to blame and most commonly are the chance is very great indeed against its being entered into from any adequate cause yet war may be said to be with regard to nations  the sin which most easily besets them  We my friends in common with other nations have much guilt to repent of from this cause and it ought to make a large part of our humiliation on this day When we carry our eyes back through the long re∣cords of our history we see wars of plunder wars  of conquest wars of religion wars of pride wars of succession wars of idle speculation wars of un∣just interference and hardly among them a war of necessary defence in any of our essential or very im∣portant interests Of late years indeed we have known none of the calamities of war in our own country but the wasteful expence of it and sitting aloof from those circumstances of personal provo∣cation which in some measure might excuse its fury we have calmly voted slaughter and merchandized destructionso much blood and tears for so many rupees or dollars or ingots Our wars have been wars of cool calculating interest as free from hatred as love of mankind the passions which stir the blood have had no share in them We devote a certain number of men to perish on land and sea and h  rest of us sleep sound and protected in our usual occupations talk of the events of war as what diver∣sifies the slat uniformity of life  In this guilty business there is a circumstance which greatly aggravates its guilt and that is the impiety of calling upon the Divine Being to assist us in it Almost all nations have been in the habit of mixing with their bad passions a shew of religion and of pre∣facing these their murders with prayers and the solemnities of worship When they send out their armies to desolate a country and destroy the fair face of nature they have the presumption to hope that the sovereign of the universe will condescend to be their auxiliary and to enter into their petry and despicable contest Their prayer if put into plain language would run thus  God of love Father of all the families of the earth we are going to tear in places our brethren of mankind but our strength is not equal to our fury we beseech thee to assist us in the work of slaughter Go out we pray thee with our fleets and armies we call them Christians and we have interwoven in our banners and the decorations of our arms the symbols of a suffering religion that we may  fight under the Cross upon which our Saviour died Whatever mischief we do we shall do it in thy name we  therefore thou will protect us in it Thou who  st  of  n  led all the dwellers upon the earth we trust thou with view us alone with partial favour and  at to bring misery upon every other g  a  ter of the globe  Now if we really expect such prayers to be a  s  ered we are the weakes  if not we a  e the most hypo  ti  of beings  THE POOR WE  P UNHEEDED  From  the Citizen of the World  by Dr Goldsmith  WHO are those who make the streets their couch and find a short repose from wretched∣ness at the doors of the opulent These are strang∣ers wanderers and orphans whose circumstances are too humble to expect redress and whose distresses are too great even for pity Their wretchedness ex∣cites rather horror than pity Some are without the covering even of rags and others emaciated with disease the world has disclaimed them society turns its back upon their distress and has given them up to nakedness and hunger These poor shivering females have once seen happier days and been flat∣tered into beauty They have been prostituted to THE GAY LUXURIOUS VILLAIN and are now turned out to meet the severity of winter Perhaps now lying at the doors of their betrayers they sue to wretches whose hearts are insensible or debau∣chee who may curse but will not relieve them  Why why was I born a man and yet see the sufferings of wretches I cannot relieve Poor house∣less creatures the world will give you reproaches but will not give you relief The slightest misfor∣tunes of the great the most imaginary uneasiness of  the rich are aggravated with all the power of elo∣quence and held up to engage our attention and sympathetic sorrow The poor weep unheeded per∣secuted by every subordinate species of tyranny and  every law which gives others security becomes an enemy to them  ON THE FOLLY OF KINGS  From  FastDay Sermons  by the Rev J Murray Author of  Sermons to Asses  Printed in    Woe to thee O Land when thy King is a child and thy Princes eat in the morning  ECCLE X ver  IT is a vulgar proverb that some people are twice children this is sometimes the lot of kings and was the case of the son of Solomon the son of David This Prince was forty and one years old when he came to the kingdom and was a child of a pretty competent age but notwithstanding his number of years his folly shewed him to be but a child It will be necessary to illustrate this Prince's childhood in a few particulars  First He obstinately refused to redress the griev∣ances of his people and threatened to encrease them Though money was plenty in the days of Solomon the people were poor gold and silver were plenty in Jerusalem and near the king's court but it does not seem to have circulated as far as Shechem and the extremities of Palastine The real wealth of nations does not consist in a large quantity of specie but in a proper balance of the value of mo∣ney with the price of useful commodities Solomon was rich but his subjects were poor and oppressed The misfortune of Solomon's government for all the  wisdom that he had was that he brought more luxu∣ries into the nation than commodities profitable for the service of the people He was also very extrava∣gant in his houshold expences and the charges of his government  "His provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour and threescore measures of meal ten fat oxen and twenty oxen out of the pasture and an hundred sheep besides harts and roebucks and fallow deer and fatted fowls He had also forty thousand stalls for horses for chariots and twelve thousand horsemen"  This was a monstrous peace establishment What a dreadful expence must this have been to the nation  Under all this shew of wealth and splendor in the king the people were poor and greatly oppressed They therefore came to the new king to ask a re∣dress of their grievances and to have their burdens made lighter But he answered them roughly and would not listen to their humble petition  They spake unto him saying Thy father made our yoke grievous now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy fa∣ther and his heavy yoke which he put upon us lighter and we will serve thee  There was nothing unrea∣sonable in all this it was a very modest request and none except a  child  or a  fool  would have refused it Solomon seems to have had some suspicion of his son before he died for he says  he hated all his labour because he was to leave it to the man that should come after him and he knew not whether he would be a wise man or a fool  What his father was afraid of he now shewed publicly in refusing the request of his people who promised willingly to serve him pro∣vided he would enable them to do it when it was in his power Could any thing be more childish than to continue an expensive government and an enor∣mous civil list when all ranks of persons were groan∣ing under burdens and complaining of oppression The complaints of the people are not to be trifled with for if princes will not relieve them they will  themselves and the Almighty will help them to do it It was a most childish action in that weak Prince to refuse such a reasonable petition which was alto∣gether for his own interest to grant for the people promised to serve him if he would ease them a little so he might have saved all by a little condescension which he lost through wilfulness and obstinacy What can princes imagine the people are made of when they treat them so ridiculously they must surely think that they are not creatures of like pas∣sions with themselves otherwise they would soon conclude that they would not suffer the treatment which they often give them  Secondly This Prince refused the advice of his father's aged and wise counsellors  They spake unto him saying if thou wilt be a servant to this people and will serve them then they will be thy servants for ever  They deserved every one a pension for this advice but such words of wisdom seldom meet with acceptance or preferment from childish princes Those old sages knew the office and duty of a king It is only that of a  public servant  to the community by fulfilling of which they secure the love and obedience of their subjects for ever which is the best security This wise counsel did not suit the humour of this  foolish  and  childish  Prince The word  servant  sounded harsh in his despotic earsA king to be a servant how uncourtly the thought how unroyal the idea those counsellors could not expect to continue long in his Majesty's service they were far too honest and free in their advice to suit the cabinet of a  childish  and  obstinate  sovereign They however discharged their duty and gave the best proofs of their regard and love to their Prince and their Country Those old men knew the state of the nation and were well persuaded that the people would not long suffer the oppressions they were groaning under they understood that many things had been now warped into government that were  contrary to the constitution of the Kingdom The law said  that the King should not multiply horses nor make the people return to Egypt for that purpose neither was he to multiply to himself silver and gola  Solomon had transgressed in all these respects and more than all he had been guilty of idolatry and had not walked in the statutes of God like David his Father These were all flagrant breaches of the constitution which the old men knew were unwarrantable and that the Lord would not suffer to pass unpunished if they were persisted in They also knew that the people's claims were just and reasonable and ought to have been complied with and for these reasons gave him wholesome counsel which a wise prince would have received with thankfulness and re∣warded with honor But this childish Prince was fonder of the gewgaws of majesty and state than the dignity of real government and chose rather to imitate the  sins  and  follies  of his Father's reign than covet his wisdom wherein he was worthy of imitation  Nothing could be more foolish and weak than to violate the fundamental laws of government It was a fundamental law of the land that the king should not have his heart lifted up above his brethren for if this should happen he nor his children were to prolong their days in the kingdom Yet this he regarded no∣thing but for the sake of unjust dominion lost the ten parts out of twelve of his whole dominions  Thirdly It was childish to turn away men of age and experience and to chuse young counsellors who knew but little and were on that account more ready to be rash and headstrong He however ad∣vised with the young men that had grown up with himself who gave him counsel according to his own inclination Perhaps some of them had been his  tutors  and had taught him those principles of go∣vernment which they wished to see put in practice now when he was come to the throne Their prin∣ciples are manifest from the advice which they gave  their sovereign  And they said unto him thus shalt thou speak unto this people that speak unto thee saying thy Father made our yoke heavy but make thou it lighter unto us thus shalt thou say unto them my little finger shall be heavier than my Father's loins and now whereas my Father did lade you with a beavy yoke I will add is your yoke my Father did chastize you with whips but I will chastize you with scorpions  This speech like many other speeches that are made for king's this childish Prince was so foolish as to deliver to the people which made them change their petition into a remonstrance which he did not soon forget  The people answered the King and said what portion have we in David Neither have we  h  ritance in the son of Jesse to your tents O Is∣rael n  w see to thine own house David  It is the greatest folly in the world for kings to drive their subjects to despair there is none can tell what a peo∣ple with do when once they are awakened All fami∣lies are alike to them when their own natural rights and privileges are come in competition  Whatever reasons Rehoboam might give for pre∣ferring these rash counsellors instead of the old sages who gave salutary advice they certainly had their foundation in weakness and childishness He might probably alledge that he had a right to chuse his own servants and prefer his particular friends this is a common argument with sovereigns when they are challenged on this head But they ought to consider that the government of a nation is very different from the government of a houshold or the manage∣ment of domestic affairs Though a king has a right to chuse his own servants yet those servants have no right to ruin a whole nation to please one man A prince may appoint whom he pleases to manage the affairs of his own house without con∣sulting the nation concerning his conduct but what relates to the public is quite different the sovereign and all his servants are accountable to the community  for the management of public affairs for there can be no authority with uncontrollable power to ruin mankind lodged in any department of society  THE ANT IN OFFICE  By GAY  to a Friend  YOU tell me that you apprehend  My verse may touchy folks offend  In prudence too you think my rhymes  Should never squint at courtiers' crimes  For though nor this nor that is meant  Can we another's thoughts prevent  You ask me if I ever knew  Court chaplains thus the lawn pursue  I meddle not with gown or lawn  Poets I grant to rise must fawn  They know great ears are overnice  And never shock their patron's vice  But I this hackney path despise  'Tis my ambition not to rise  If I must prostitute the muse  The base conditions I refuse  I neither flatter nor defame  Yet own I won'd bring guilt to shame  If I corruption's hand expose  I make corrupted men my foes  What then I hate the paultry tribe  Be virtue minebe their's the bribe  I no man's property invade  Corruption's yet no lawful trade  Nor would it mighty ills produce  Could I shame brib'ry out of use  I know 'twould cramp most politicians  Were they ty'd down to these conditions  'Twould stint their pow'r their riches bound  And make their parts seem less profound  Were they deny'd their proper tools  How could they lead their knaves and fools  Were this the case let's take a view  What dreadful mischiefs would ensue  Though it might aggrandize the state  Could private luxury dine on plate  Kings might indeed their friends reward  But ministers find less regard  Informers sycophants and spies  Would not augment the year's supplies  Perhaps too take away this prop  An annual job or two might drop  Besides if pensions were deny'd  Could avarice support its pride  It might even ministers confound  And yet the state be safe and sound  I care not though 'tis understood  I only mean my country's good  And let who will my freedom blame  I wish all courtiers did the same  Nay though some folks the less might get  I wish the nation out of debt  I put no private man's ambition  With public good in competition  Rather than have our law defac'd  I'd vote a minister disgrac'd  I strike at vice be't where it will  And what if great folks take it ill  I hope corruption bribery pension  One may with detestation mention  Think you the law let who will take it  Can  scandalum magnatum  make it  I vent no slander owe no grudge  Nor of another's conscience judge  At him or him I take no aim  Yet dare against all vice declaim  Shall I not censure breach of trust  Because knaves know themselves unjust  That steward whose account is clear  Demands his honour may appear  His actions never shun

at Neweastle by  T SPENCE  in the Year    WHETHER it would not be very pleasant to see one horse claiming all the pasture as his and ordering all the rest to depart the same unless they fulfilled certain conditions which he chused to impose and whether to see those poor beasts gather∣ing the herbage with unceasing anxiety and diligence eating only the worst but sacredly refraining from the hest and bringing it in large bundles with all humi∣lity and dissidence to the  gentlehorse  who receives it with the highest air of superiority and unthank∣fulness  and who though they bring him more than he can destroy yet is so far from mitigating their tasks that he takes frequent occasions to encrease them I say whether to see all this would not be to see too favourable a picture of landlord and te∣nant  Whether if every pasture of the earth were thus claimed and monopolized by some or other  gentle∣horse  as they are by some or other  gentle  man it would not be a most miserable thing to be a  landless  horse  Whether if one of those unfortunate  landless  horses should offer to convince his fellowsufferers that it was the most despicable silliness to drudge thus con∣tinually for permission to live on the earth which they had as good a right to as their oppressors and should advise them to throw off such ignominious servitude and that if their assuming lords would not give up all thoughts of superiority and tyranny over their fellowcreatures that they should have their brains kicked out I fay whether this poor beast could be blamed for so doing or justly branded with improper selfishness levelling turbulency sedition or other hard names  Whether there would not be more reason for sus∣pecting such as took part with the  gentle  horses of selfishness as none certainly would but from hopes of sharing in the plunder or of becoming  gentry  sometime or other themselves and exempted from the labour of cutting their own grass whereas the poor levelling horse could expect nothing from his impartial scheme but his bare natural due which it is the highest honour to claim and prevent all en∣croachments upon  Whether those brutes who would not join sin∣cerely with this honest horse for the recovery of their rights for themselves and posterity from any cause but especially from being bribed or hired by their oppressors ought not to be deemed unworthy of every privilege of nature and spurned from the face of the earth  Whether one man has a natural right to rule over or demand rent of another man more than one horse has a right to rule over or demand rent of another horse  Whether man is not rightful lord of the whole world namely of lands animals plants minerals c  Whether to attempt to deprive any man of this his birthright is not attempting to make him less than man  Whether fathers have a right to waste or alienate that which their posterity can not be men without and whether if they did their sons have not a right to claim and reposses themselves of the  ame  Whether buying and felling land is not as illegal and unjust according to the law of nature as buying and selling stolen goods  Whether in Spensonia where the land is entirely public property a person with much money would have more reason to complain that he could not pur∣chase land with his money than one that has little  Whether if a person grows rich in money which he has a right to do by his industry trading or other lawful means he ought therefore to complain that he cannot reduce his fellowcreatures to a state of dependence upon him by purchasing their land  Whether the public and the hirer of a poor la∣bouring man are not said to be clear with him upon paying him his wages and whether the public ought not to be accounted as clear with a rich man upon paying him his due in money though they suffer him not to purchase their land  Whether it is not enough that he be allowed to trade lend spend or lay up give away or do what he will with his riches buying land or men's persons excepted  Whether if trafficking in land be pleaded as a great and laudable incitement to industry trafficking in the persons of men may not as justly be pleaded for the same reason  Whether those who live by their rents may not be said to live on the parish more properly than most of the poor people who are said to do so because those locusts get what they get from the public for nothing whereas the most of the poor have by their for  er labour laid up an ample stock in the hands of the public to subsist on in their old age and under in∣firmities  Whether the poor ought not to be allowed one person or book to plead their interest when the rich have so many of both to plead theirs  Whether if the right honourable the gentlemen will not accept of our lands and labours without our reason too they do not deserve to want all  Whether if they thought it for their interest that we should not fee we ought therefore to put out our eyes to oblige them  Whether the  landed  men do not take upon them∣selves the sole lordship of this world even to the power of killing a hare and treat the rest of men as a species of the brute creation made for their service and convenience and whether when these creatures are not spoiled by thinking on things too high and as they say out of their sphere they are not the most tractable and useful animals to their masters that can be  Whether truth ought to be discouraged or hid through fear of danger and if so whether the most important truths have not enemies who to have them smothered would pronounce them dan∣gerous  Whether we would not laugh at any profession trade or interest that should call those principles dangerous by which it could be proved that they defrauded and robbed the public of millions annually and were combined together for that purpose and whether we have not as good reason to laugh at the profession of gentlemen when they call levelling principles dangerous  Whether though the members of the body for their own benefit must maintain the belly they may not lawfully destroy all the worms therein  HISTORY AND ORIGIN OF REPUBLICS  From  The P  d  n Letters  By Lord Lyttleton  ONE of the thing which must exercised my cu∣riosity after my arrival in Europe was the History and Origin of Republics Thou knowest that generally the  Asiatics  have not so much as the least idea of this sort of government and that their imagination never extended so far as to comprehend there could possibly be any other sort than the des∣potic throughout the world  The first governments were monarchical it was only by chance and length of time that republics were formed  Greece  having been swallowed up by a deluge new inhabitants came to people it she had almost all her Colonies from Egypt and the nearest  Asiatic  countries and those countries being governed by  ngs the people that came out of them were governed in the like mannerr But the tyranny of those princes growing too heavy the people shook osl the yoke and from the broken remains of so many kingdoms arose those republics which made  Greece  so very flourishing the only polite country amidst Barba∣rians  The love of liberty and aversion to kings pre∣served  Greece  a long time in a state of independence and very far extended the republican government The cities of Greece found allies in  Asia Minor  they sent thither colonies as free as themselves which were so many ramparts against the attempts of the kings of  P    This was not all  Greece  peopled  Italy Italy Spain  and perhaps  Gaul  It is noto∣rious that the great  H  peria  so famous among the antients was at the beginning  Greece  which was looked upon by its neighbours as the seat of felicity the  Greeks  not finding at home that happy country  went and looked for it in  Italy  those of  Italy  in  Spain  those of  Spain  in  Boetica  or  Portugal  so that all these regions went by this name among the ancients These  Greek  Colonies carried along with them a spirit of liberty which they had assumed from that kindly climate And accordingly we seldom or never in those remote times meet with monarchies in  Italy Spain  or either of the  Gauls  We shall see by and by that the people of the  North  and of  Germany  were no less free than the others and if there are appearances of any thing like royalty among them it is because their leaders of armies or heads of republics were mis∣taken for kings  All this happened in  Europe  as for  Asia  and  Africa  they were ever oppressed with despotism excepting some towns of  Asia Minor  already taken notice of and the republic of Carthage in Africa  The world was divided between two powerful republics  Rome  and  Carthage  nothing is so well known as the beginning of the Roman republic and nothing so little known as the origin of that of  Carthage  we are utterly ignorant of the succes∣sion of the  African  Princes after  Dido  nor do we know by what means they came to lose their pow∣er The prodigious increase of the  Roman  repub∣lic would have been a great blessing to mankind had there not been that unreasonable difference between the citizens of  Rome  and the conquered nations had they given to the governors of pro∣vinces a more limited authority had they paid due regard to those divine laws made to restrain their tyranny and had they not in order to si∣lence those laws employed the very treasures which their rapine and injustice had accumulated together  Liberty seems to be calculated to the genius of the nations of  Europe  and slavery adapted to tha of the  Asiatics  In vain did the  Romans  offer tht  invaluable treasure to the  Cappadocians  that worth∣less nation refused it and courted servitude with the same ardour as other nations pursued liberty  Ca  sar  crushed the  Roman  republic and brought it under arbitrary power  Europe  groaned a long time beneath the military and violent government and the  Roman  mildness was changed into a hardhearted oppression  Mean while infinite numbers of unknown na∣tions swarmed from out the  North  spread them∣selves like torrents through all the  Roman  provin∣ces and finding it as easy a thing to make conquests as to increase their piracies they dismembered those provinces and made kingdoms of them These people were free and they so confined the authority of their kings that they were properly speaking no more than chieftains or generals Thus those kingdoms though founded in force felt not the yoke of a conqueror When the na∣tions of  Asia  namely the  Turks  and the  Tartars  made any conquests they being accustomed to the will and pleasure of one single person thought of nothing more than bringing him new subjects and by the force of arms establish his violent authority but the  Nothern  nations being free in their own country when they had seized the  Roman  pro∣vinces took care not to bestow on their chief too large a power Nay some of them the  Vandals  for instance in  Africa  the Goths in Spain depos∣ed their kings whenever they were dissatisfied with them and the others too abridged the authority of the prince a thousand ways a great number of lords took share of it with him a war was never entered into without their consent the plunder was divided between the general and the soldiers no taxation in favour of the prince the laws were made in assemblies of the whole nation such was the fundamental principle of all those states that were formed out of the wrecks of the  Roman  em∣pire  EDMUND BURKE's  Address to the  Swinish Multitude  "Here is the

perfect in the world And if the sa∣tisfaction and happiness of the people the equal distribution of justice and the preservation of de∣cency and good order in the community are proofs of its excellence they have great reason to be fond of their constitution The privileges it confers on the lower orders of the people must for ever secure their allegiance and attachment to it for the meanest citizen is eligible and has an equal chance with the greatest and most opulent to ob∣  in a seat in the sovereign councils of the republic  Indeed their method of chufing the members of their legislature is not in speculation very favour∣able to the promotion of good government for the members are not chosen for their virtues their talents their influence or their birth the ap∣pointment of them is left wholly to the caprice of fortune who fills offices and makes counsellors of state in the republic of Basil in the same manner and with as little respect to persons as she distri∣  es prizes in the English Lottery This fanciful  thod of conducting elections and bestowing of∣  may sometimes have a ludicrous or inconve∣ment effect but as such accidental events neither  the dignity of their legislature impede the  tion or weaken the efficacy of the laws the  vention of them is not worth a thought It eight not perhaps be without its benefits if the  ne practice was introduced into some countries where matters of this sort stand in great need of  lation for it is beyond dispute a most effec∣  al remedy against that corruption which de∣fects the noblest efforts of patriotism and reduces the best modelled constitutions to a level with the worst  On the  ational  Sin  of Involving succeeding generations in Debt  From a pamphlet entitled "Sins of the Nation"  EXTRAVAGANCE is a sin to which the nati∣ons as well as private persons are  y prone and the consequences to both are exactly similar If a private man lives beyond his income the con∣sequence will be lo  s of independence disgrace∣  l perplexity and in the end certoir ruin The  tastrophies of states are flower m  ipening but  like causes must in the end produce like effects If you are acquainted with any individual who from inattention to his affairs misplaced confidence foolish lawsuits anticipation of his rents and pro∣fession in his family expences has involved him∣self in debts that eat away his income what would you say to such a one Would you not tell him contract your expences look yourself into your affairs insist upon exact accounts from your stew∣ard and bailiffs keep no servants for mere show and parade mind only your own affairs and keep at peace with your neighbours set religiously apart an annual sum for discharging the mortgages on your estate If this be good advice for one man it is good advise for  ninemillion  of men If this individual should persist in his course of unthrifty prosussion saying to himself the ruin will not come in my time the misery will not fall upon me let posterity take care of itself would you not pro∣nounce him at once very weak and very selfesh my friends a  nation  that should pursue the same conduct would be equally reprehensible  TRIBUTE

thought they would at least have this advantage to give their owners cheerful hearts and countenances they would often s  ir them up to express their thankfulness to God and discover their satisfaction to the world But in fact the contrary to all this is true For where are there more cloudy brows more melancholy hearts or more ingratitude to their great benefactor than among those who abound in wealth And indeed it is natural that it should be so because those men who covet things that are hard to be got must be hard to please whereas a small thing maketh a poor man happy and great losses cannot befal him  It is likewise worth considering how few among the rich have procured their wealth by just mea∣sures how many owe their fortunes to the sins of their parents how many more to their own If men's titles were to be tried before a true court of conscience where false swearing and a thou∣sand vile artifices that are well known and can  hardly be avoided in human courts of justice would avail nothing how many would be ejected with infamy and disgrace how many grow con∣siderable by breach of trust by bribery and corrup∣tion How many have sold their religion with the rights and liberties of themselves and others for power and employments  And it is a mistake to think that the most hard∣ened sinner who oweth his possession or titles to any such wicked arts of thieving can have true peace of mind under the reproaches of a guilty conscience and amidst the cries of ruined widows and orphans  I know not one real advantage that the rich have over the poor except the power of doing good to others But this is an advantage which God hath not given wicked men the grace to make use of The wealth acquired by evil means was ne∣ver employed to good ends for that would be to divide the kingdom of  Satan  against itself What∣ever hath been gained by fraud avarice oppres∣sion and the like must be preserved and increased by the same methods  I shall add but one thing more upon this head which I hope will convince you that God whose thoughts are not as our thoughts never intended riches or power to be necessary for the happiness of mankind in this life because it is certain that there is not one single good quality of the mind ab∣solutely necessary to obtain them where men are resolved to be rich at any rate neither honour justice temperance wisdom religion truth or learning for a slight acquaintance of the world will inform us that there have been many instan∣ces of men in all ages who have arrived at great possessions and great dignities by cunning fraud or flattery without any of these or any other vir∣rues that can be named Now if riches and great∣ness were such blessings that good men without  them could have their share of happiness in this life how cometh it to pass that God should suf∣fer them to be often dealt to the worst and most profligate of mankind that they should be gene∣rally procured by the most abominable means and applied to the basest and most wicked uses This ought not to be conceived of a just a mercisul a wise and almighty being We must therefore con∣clude that wealth and power are in their own nature at best but things indifferent and that a good man may be equally happy without them provided that he hath a sufficiency of the common blessings of human life to answer all the reasonable and virtuous demands of nature which his indus∣try will provide and sobriety will prevent his wanting Agur's prayer with the reasons of his wish are full to this purpose  Give me neither poverty nor riches feed me with food conveni∣ent for me lest I be full and deny thee and say who is the Lord Or lest I be poor and steal and take the name of my God in vain  ON SACRILEGE  From Cato's Letters  SACRILEGE we are told by some signifies the robbing or stealing from God any thing which is peculiarly his Now nothing can be stolen from God nor can any thing be conceal∣ed from him Every thing being his it is as much his in the hands of one man as in the hands of ano∣ther for let who will have the use of it the pro∣perty cannot be altered God who has all things can never be put out of possession of any thing and as nothing can be taken from him so neither can anything be given to him because all the world and every thing in it is aheady his and it is ab∣surd  to imagine that any form of words or change of place or position can enlarge or lessen his pro∣perty in any thing All that we have we have from him and to return him his own gifts back again which we want and he does not is no com∣pliment nor any part of religion or reason It is shewing ourselves wiser than he in setting apart for his use those things which he has graciously created and set apart for ours Can we feed him or can we cloath adorn or enrich him Can we build him a city to dwell in or furnish him with guards for the security of his person  Sacrilege therefore is either the robbing of men or no robbery at all And this crime is greater or less according to the measure or mischief done To rob a poor man of his loaf is a greater crime in  foro conscientiae  than to rob a rich man of an Ox To rob a man of a small part of a thing that is necessary to him is a greater crime than the rob∣bing him of a great superfluity and if I rob a man of a thing that will do him hurt I hope I do him less an injury than if I robbed him of a thing which does him good But if I take a thing which no man has a right to I myself have a right to it by possessing it  To apply all this to the business of Sacrilege if a man take away any of the books vestments or utensils made use of in devotion he only robs the congregation who must buy more and many be∣ing more able than one to bear the loss the offence as to its effects is less than if he robbed but one man But if he take away from a Heathen Tem∣ple plate or hidden treasure laid up there but not used he indeed does an action that he has no right to do but an action that however does good to the world by turning into use that which was of none or of bad use  Dead treasure first drawn from the people in su∣perstitious offerings and then laid up in a Hea∣then  Temple and kept and used for impious and idolatrous ends but never to return again into the world for the necessary purposes of life and com∣merce is the plunder of mankind and the worst of all plunders because it never circulates and people are greatly the worse for it in respect both of soul and body but never can be the better it is first taking from them and afterwards denying them the great and chief means of life and convenience He therefore whoever he be that takes it from thence let him take it in what manner he will does a better and more public thing than he who keeps it there  No man can be robbed of a thing in which he has no property Of this sort was Apollo's wealth and nobody was robbed in taking it away So that whoever takes away golden images or other dead wealth the means and objects of false adoration is guilty of no other crime than that of disturbing erroneous consciences Nor need such consciences be much disturbed since the crime being commit∣ted without their consent they have no share in it And therefore if such idolatrous images and such superstitious useless and pe  nic ous riches be taken away by a lawful authority or in a lawful war it is no crime at all So that in every sense  Byennus  committed a greater crime in plundering one village than he could have committed had he plundered as he intended the Temple of  Delphos  THE PROGRESS OF TAXATION  From the Morning Chronicle  WHEN the common people of any state can supply the exorbitant demands of their Prince no longer the estates of the Nobility will be the next resource and like the mastiff dog in the beehive when he has sucked up all the honey  he will swallow the comb and then the greater part of Europe will be in the condition of Turkey most of its Princes will be sole proprietors of the land as they now make themselves of its produce which is very near the same thing When the te∣nants exhausted by taxes are unable to pay rent the land yielding no profit is as bad as none and in some instances worse than none as we are par∣ticularly told by the noble author of the account of Denmark where some landlords have begged of the King upon their knees to ease them of their land by taking it from them for good and all for it was taxed more than it was worth  A LETTER AGAINST BRIBERY AND AR∣BITRARY GOVERNMENT  From Algernon Sidney to his Friends in answer to theirs persuading his return to England  SIR  I AM sorry I cannot in all things conform myself to the advices of my friends if theirs had any joint concernment with mine I would willingly submit my interest to theirs but when I alone am interested and they only advise to come over as soon as the act of indemnity is passed because they think it is best for me I cannot wholly lay aside my own judgment and choice I confess we are natu∣rally inclined to delight in our own country and I have a particular love to mine I hope I have given some testimony of it I think that being exiled from it is a great evil and would redeem myself from it with the loss of a great deal of my blood but when that country of mine which used to be esteemed a paradise is now like to be made a stage of injury the liberty which we hoped to establish  oppressed all manner of profaneness looseness luxury and lewdness set up in its height instead of the piety virtue sobriety and modesty which we hoped God by our hands would have intro∣duced the best of our nation made a prey to the worst the parliament court and army corrupted the people enslaved and all things vendible and no man safe but by such evil and infamous means as flattery and bribery what joy can I have in my own country in this condition Is it a pleasure to see all that I love in the world sold and destroyed Shall I renounce all my old principles learn the vile court arts and make my peace by bribing some of them Shall their corruption and vice be my safety Ah no better is a life among stran∣gers than in my country upon such conditions Whilst I live I will endeavour to preserve my li∣berty or at least not consent to the destroying of it I hope I shall die in the same principle in which I have lived and will live no longer than they can preserve me I have in my life been guilty of many follies but as I think of no meanness I will not blot and de file that which is past by endeavouring to provide for the future I have ever had in my mind that when God should cast me into such a condition as that I cannot save my life but by doing an indecent thing he shews me the time is come wherein I should resign it And when I can∣not live in my own country but by such moans as are worse than dying in it I think he shews me I ought to keep myself out of it Let them please themselves with making the king glorious who think a  whole  people may justly be sacrificed for the interest and pleasure of  one  man and a  few  of his follow∣ers let them rejoice in their subtility who by betray∣ing the former powers have gained the favour of this not only preserved but advanced themselves in these dangerous changes Nevertheless perhaps they may find the king's glory is their shame his plenty  the people's misery and that the gaining of an of∣fice or a little money is a  poor  reward for destroy∣ing a nation which if it were preserved in liberty and virtue would truly be the most glorious in the world and that others may find they have with much pains purchased their own shame and misery a dear price paid for that which is not worth keep∣ing nor the life that is accompanied with it the honour of English Parliaments have ever been in making the nation glorious and happy not in selling and destroying the interest of it to satisfy the lusts of one man  Miserable Nation  that from so great a height of glory is fallen into the most despicable condition in the world of having all its good depending upon the breath and will of the vilest persons in it  cheated  and  fold  by them they trust  infamous traffick  equal almost in guilt to that of Judas In all preceding ages Parliaments have been the pillars of our liberty the sure defend∣ers of the oppressed They who formerly could bridle kings and keep the balance equal between them and the people are now become the instru∣ments of all our oppressions and a sword in his hand to destroy us They themselves led by a few interested persons who are willing to buy offices for themselves by the misery of the whole nation and the blood of the most worthy and eminent per∣sons in it Detestable bribes worse than the oaths now in fashion in his mercenary court I mean to owe neither my life nor liberty to any such means when the innocence of my actions will not protect me I will stay away till the storm be overpassed In short where  Vane Lambert  and  Haslerigg  cannot live in safety I cannot live at all If I had been in England I should have expected a lodging with them or though they may be the first as being more eminent than I I must expect to follow their example in suffering as I have been their compa∣nion in acting I am most in a maze at the mistaken  informations that were sent to me by my friends full of expectations of favours and employments Who can think that they who imprison them would employ me or suffer me to live when they are put to death If I might live and be employed can it be expected that I should serve a government that seeks such detestable ways of establishing itsolf Ah no I have not learned to make my own peace by  persecuting  and  betraying  my brethren more innocent and more worthy than myself I must live by  just means  and serve to  just ends  or  not at all  after such a manifestation of the ways by which it is intended the king shall govern I should have renounced any place of favour into which the kindness and industry of my friends might have ad∣vanced me when I found those that were better than I were only fit to be destroyed I had for∣merly some jealousies the fraudulent proclamation for indemnity encreased the imprisoning of those three men and turning out of all the officers of the army contrary to promise confirmed me in my re∣solutions not to return  To conclude the tide is not to be diverted nor the oppressed delivered but God in his time will have mercy on his People he will save and defend them and avenge the blood of those who shall now perish upon the heads of those who in their pride think nothing is able to oppose them Hap∣py are those whom God shall make instruments of his justice in so blessed a work If I can live to see that day I shall be ripe for the grave and able to say with joy Lord now lettest thou thy ser∣vant depart in peace c So Sir Arthur Haslerigg on Oliver's death Farewel my thoughts as to king and state depending upon their actions No man shall be a more faithful servant to him than I  if he make the good and prosperity of his people his glory none more his enemy if he doth the con∣trary To my particular friends I shall be constant on all occasions and to you  A most affectionate Servant  A SIDNEY  AN OLD BRITISH SONG WHEN THE ROMANS RULED THE LAND  LONG may great Caesar live  To him your treasure give  Gen'rous and free  His feelings are so tough  You ne'er can give enough  Why keep ye back the stuff  Rebels ye be  See on the gold so fair  His graceful picture there  Which as you view  Worshipand let it be  Sent to his Treasury  Send it to him that he  May worship too  You have a house and bed  And you are clothed and fed  Temp'rate and bare  Still let it be your aim  Pride and excess to tame  For your kind masters claim  All

a hopeful race  Now all alive  O how it swells the song  Princes so young so strong  Might draw a dray along  Ready to drive  Long live our NOBLE King  To him your treasure bring  Gen'rous and free  Let it our hearts elate  Still to support the great  Proud of our low estate  Still let us be  A  VINDICATION OF  BRUTUS  For having killed  CAESAR  From CATO'S Letters  CAESAR had usurped the  Roman  world and was cantoning it out to his creatures as be∣came a tyrant and paying his personal favourites with the public bounty As the worst tyrants must have some friend and as the best men do them the most credit and bring them the most sup∣port  if such can be got  Caesar  had sense enough to know that he could never buy  Brutus  too dear and so paid him great court But  Brutus  saw the tyrant's design and his own shame and every ci∣vility was a fresh provocation It was as if a thief  breaking into a house to rob a lady of her jewels spoke thus to her son  Sir pray permit me or assist me to cut your mother's throat and seize her treasure and I will generously reward you with your life and lend you one or two of her diamonds to sparkle in as long as I think fit  Could such a villainous civility as this engage the son especially a virtuous son to any thing but revenge And would not the only way that he could take it be the best way  Caesar  took from  Brutus  his liberty and his legal title to his life and his estate and gave him in lieu of it a precarious one during his own arbitrary will and pleasure Upon the same terms he gave him some mercenary employments as hire for that great man's assistance to support his tyranny Could the great and free soul of  Brutus  brook this Could  Brutus  be the instrument or confederate of lawless just  Brutus  receive wages from an oppressor That great virtuous and popular  Brutus  who if the common wealth had subsisted might from his repu∣tation birth abilities and his excellent worth have challenged the most honourable and advan∣tageous offices in it without owing thanks to  Caesar  So that the injuries done by  Caesar  to  Brutus  were great heinous and many and the favours none All the mercy shewn by  Caesar  was art and affecta∣tion and pure selflove He had found in the  Roman  people so universal a detestation of the bloody measures of  Marius Cinna  and  Sylla  He saw the whole empire so reduced and enervated by repeated proscriptions and massacres that he thought  t his interest to establish his newerected domi∣nion by different measures and to reconcile by a false and hypocritical shew of clemency the minds of men yet bleeding with the late and former wounds to his usurpation that  Caesar  the usurp∣ing and destructive  Caesar  who had slaughtered millions and wantonly made havock of human race had any other sort of mercy than the mercy  of policy and deceit will not be pretended by any man that knows his and the  Roman  story  Brutus  therefore being the most reverenced and popular man in  Rome  it became the crast of the tyrant to make  Brutus  his friend it was adding a sort of sanctity to a wicked cause Whereas the death of  Brutus  by  Caesar  would have made  Caesar  odious and dreadful even amongst his own follow∣ers  But it is said that  Brutus  submitted to  Caesar  and was bound by his own act Here the allegation is true but the consequence false Did not  Brutus  submit to  Caesar  as innocent men are often forced to submit to the gallies the wheel and the gibbet He submitted as a man robbed and bound submits to a housebreaker who with a pistol at his heart forces from him a discovery of his trea∣sure and a promise not to prosecute him Such engagements are not only void in themselves but aggravate the injuries by the law of nature and rea∣son as well as by the positive institutions of every country all promises bonds or oaths extorted by duress that is by unlawful imprisonments or menaces are not obligatory It is on the contrary a crime to fulfil them because an acquiescence in the impositions of lawless villains is abetting law∣less villains  Besides it was not in the power of  Brutus  to alter his allegiance which he had already engaged to the Commonwealth which had done nothing to forfeit the same For how lawful soever it be for subjects to transfer their obedience to a con∣queror in foreign war when the former civil pow∣er can no longer protect them or to a new magis∣trate made by consent when the old had forfeited or resigned It is ridiculous to suppose that they can transfer it to a domestic traitor and robbet who is under the same ties and allegiance with themselves and by all acts of violence treason  and usurpation extorts a submission from his op∣pressed masters and fellow subjects At least such allegiance can never be reengaged whilst any means  nature are left to rid the world of such a mon∣  ter  It is a poor charge against  Brutus  that  Caesar  in∣  ended him for his heir and successor  Brutus  scorn∣  d to succeed a tyrant And what more glorious for  Brutus  than thus to own that the dangerous and bewitching prospect of the greatest power that ever mortal man possessed could not shake the firm and virtuous heart of  Brutus  nor corrupt his integrity To own that no personal considerations not even the highest upon earth could reconcile him to a tyrant and that he preferred the liberty of the world to the empire of the world  The above charges therefore against  Brutus  can hardly come from any but those who like the profane and slavish  Esau  would sell their birth∣right for a mess of pottage would sacrifice their duty to their interest and unconcerned what be∣comes of the rest of mankind would promote ty∣ranny if they might but shine in its trappings But an honest mind a mind great and virtuous scorns and hates all ambition but that of doing good to men and to  all  men it despises momen∣tary riches and illgotten power it enjoys no vi∣cious and  hardhearted  pleasures arising from the miseries of others But it wishes and endeavours to procure impartial diffusive and universal hap∣piness to the  whole  earth  This is the character of a great and good mind and this was the great and sublime soul of the im∣mortal  Brutus  EXCELLENT BRUTUS OF ALL HUMAN RACE  The best  Cowley  A memorable Letter from Brutus to Cicero  I HAVE seen by the favour of  Atticus  that part which concerns me in your letter to  Octavius  The affection which you there express for my per∣son and the pains which you take for my safety are great but they give me no new joy Your kind offices are become as habitual for me to re∣ceive as for you to bestow and by your daily dis∣course and actions in my behalf I have daily in∣stances of your generous regard for myself and my reputation  However all this hinders not but that the above∣mentioned article of your letters to  Octavius  pierc∣ed me with as sensible a grief as my soul is capable of feeling In thanking him for his services to the republic you have chosen a stile which shews such lowness and submission as do but too clearly de∣clare that you have still a master and that the old tyranny which we thought destroyed is revived in a new tyrant What shall I say to you upon this sad head I am covered with confusion for your shameful condition but you have brought it upon yourself and I cannot help shewing you to yourself in this wretched circumstance  You have petitioned  Octavius  to have mercy upon me and to save my lifeIn this you intend my good but sought my misery and a lot worse than death by saving me from it since there is no kind of death but is more eligible to me than a life so sa∣ved Be so good to recollect a little the terms of your letter and having weighed them as you ought can you deny that they are conceived in the low stile of an humble petition from a slave to his haugh∣ty lord from a subject to a king You tell  Octavius  that you have a request to make him and hope that he will please to grant it namely to save those  citizens who are esteemed by men of condition and beloved by the people of Rome This is your honourable request but what if he should not grant it but refuse to save us Can we be saved by no other expedient Certainly destruction it∣self is preferable to life by his favour  I am not however so desponding as to imagine that heaven is so offended with the  Roman  people or so bent upon their ruin that you should thus chuse in your prayers to apply rather to  Octavius  than to the immortal Gods for the preservation I do not say of the deliverers of the whole earth but even for the preservation of the meanest  Roman  citizen This is a high tone to talk in but I have pleasure in it It becomes me to shew that  I scorn to pray to those whom I scorn to fear  Has then  Octavius  power to save us and while you thus own him to be a tyrant can you yet own yourself his friend And while you are mine can you desire to see me in  Rome  and at the mercy of an usurper And yet that this would be my case you avow by imploring from a giddy boy my permission to return you have been rendering him a world of thanks and making him many compli∣ments pray how came they to be due to him if he yet want to be petitioned for our lives and if our liberties depend upon his sufferance Are we bound to think it a condescension in  Octavius  that he chuses that these our petitions should rather be made to him than to  Anthony  And are not such low supplications the proper addresses to a tyrant And yet shall we who boldly destroyed one be ever brought basely to supplicate another And can we who are the deliverers of the Common∣wealth descend to ask what no man ought to have it in his power to give  Consider the mournful effects of that dread and despondency of yours in our public struggle in which however you have too many to keep you  in countenance  The Commonwealth has been los  because it was given for lost  Hence Caesar was first inspired with the lust of dominion hence  Mark Anthony  not terrified by the doom of the tyrant pants and hurries on to succeed him in his tyranny and hence this  Octavius  this green usurper is start∣ed into such a pitch of power that the chiefs of the commonwealth and the saviours of their country must depend for their breath upon his pleasure Yes we must owe our lives to the mercy of a mi∣nor softened by the prayers of aged senators  Alas we are no longer  Romans  If we were the virtuous spirit of liberty would have been an ealy overmatch for the traiterous attempts of the worst of all men grasping after tyranny nor would even  Mark Anthony  the rash and enterprising  Mark Antho∣ny  have been so fond of  Caesar  's power as frighten∣ed by  Caesar  's sate  Remember the important character which you sustain the great post which you have filled You me a  e  or of  Rome  you have been consul of  Rome  you have defeated conspiraces you have destroved conspirators Is not  Rome  still as dear to you as she was Or▪ is your courage and vigilance less And is not the occasion greater Or could you suppress great traitors and yet tolerate great∣er Recollect what you ought to do by what you have done Whence proceeded your enmity to  Anthony  Was it not that he had an enmity to li∣berty had seized violently on the public assumed the disposal of life and death into his own hands and set up for the sole sovereign of all men Were not these the reasons of your enmity and of your advice to combat violence by violence to kill him rather than sub  t to him All this was well but why must resistance be dropped when there is a fresh call for resistance Has your courage sailed you or was it not permitted to  Anthony  to en∣slave us but another may As if the nature of ser∣vitude  were changed by changing names and persons No we do not dispute about the qualifications of a master we will have  no  master  It is certain that we might under  Anthony  have had large shares with him in the administra∣tion of despotic power we might have divided its dignities and shone in its trappings He would have received us graciously and met us half way  He knew that either our concurrence or acquies∣cence would have confirmed him monarch of  Rome  and at what price would he not have purchased either But all his arts all his temptations all his offers were rejected liberty was our purpose vir∣tue our rule Our views were honest and univer¦sal our country and the cause of mankind  With  Octavius  himself there is still a way open for an accommodation if we chose it As eager as the name of  Caesar  has made that raw stickler for empire to destroy those who destroyed  Caesar  yet doubtless he would give us good articles to gain our consent to that power to which he aspires and to which I fear he will atrive alas what is there to hinder him While we only attend to the love of life and the impulses of ambition while we can purchase posts and dignities with the price of liberty and think danger more dreadful than slavery what remains to save us  What was the end of our killing the tyrant but to be free from tyrannyA ridiculous motive and an empty exploit if our slavery survive him Oh who is it that makes liberty his care Liberty which ought to be the care of all men as it is the benefit and blessing of all For myself rather than give it up I will stand single in its defence I can∣not lose but with my life my resolution to main∣tain in freedom my country which I have set free I have destroyed a veteran tyrant and shall I suf∣fer in a raw youth his heir a power to controul the senate supersede the laws and put chains  on  Rome  A power which no personal favours nor even the ties of blood could ever sanctify to me a power which I could not bear in  Caesar  nor if my father had usurped it could I have borne him  Your petition to  Octavius  is a confession that we cannot enjoy the liberty of Rome without his leave and can you dream that other citizens are free where we could not live free Besides having made your request how is it to be fulfilled You beg him to give us our lives and what if he do Are we therefore safe because we live Is there any safety without liberty or rather can we poor∣ly live having lost it and with it our honour and glory is there any security in living at  Rome  when  Rome  is no longer free That city great as it is having no security of her own can give me noneNo I will owe mine to my resolution and my sword I cannot enjoy life at the mercy of another  Caesar  's death alone ascertained my liberty to me which before was precarious I smote him to be safe This is a Ro∣man spirit and whithersoever I carry it every place will be  Rome  to me who am  Roman  enough to prefer every evil to chains and infamy which to a Roman are the highest of all evils I thought that we had been released from these mighty evils by the death of him who brought them upon us but it seems that we are not else why a servile petition to a youth big with the name and the am∣bition of  Caesar  for mercy to those patriots who generously revenged their country upon that ty∣rant and cleared the world of his tyranny It was not thus in the Commonwealths of  Greece  where the children of tyrants suffered equally with their fathers the punishment of tyranny  Can I then have any appetite to see  Rome  or can  Rome  be said to be  Rome  We have slain our tyrant we have restored our ancient liberty But  they are favours thrown away she is made free in spite of herself and though she has seen a great and terrible tyrant bereft of his grandeur and his life by a few of her citizens yet basely despond∣ing of her own strength she impotently dreads the name of a dead tyrant revived in the person of a stripling  No more of your petitions to your young  Caesar  on my behalf nor if you are wise on your own You have not many years to live do not be shew∣ing that you overrate the short remains of an ho∣nourable life by making preposterous and disho∣nourable court to a boy Take care that by this conduct you do not eclipse the lustre of all your glorious actions against  Mark Anthony  Do not turn your glory into reproach by giving the ma∣licious a handle to say that selflove was the sole motive of your bitterness to him and that had you not dreaded him you would not have opposed him And yet will they not say this if they see that having declared war against  Anthony  you notwithstanding have life and liberty at the mercy of  Octavius  and tolerate in him all the power which the other claimed They will say that you are not against having a master only you would not have Anthony for a master  I will approve of your praises given to  Octavius  for his behaviour thus far it is indeed praise wor∣thy provided his only intention has been to pull down the tyranny of  Anthony  without establishing a tyranny of his own But if you are of opinion that  Octavius  is in such a situation of power that it is necessary to approach him with humble sup∣plications to save our lives and that it is conveni∣ent he should be trusted with this power I can only say that you lift the reward of his merits far above his merits I thought that all his services were services done to the republic but you have conferred upon him that absolute and imperial pow∣er which he pretended to recover to the republic  If in your judgment  Octavius  has earned such laurels and recompences for making war again  An∣thony  's tyranny which was only the effects and remains of  Caesar  's tyranny to what distinctions to what rewards would you entitle those who ex∣terminated with  Caesar  the tyranny of  Caesar  for which they felt the blessings and bounty of the  Roman  people Has this never entered into your thoughts Behold here how effectually the terror of evils to come extinguishes in the minds all impressions of benefits received  Caesar  is dead and will never return to shackle or frighten the City of  Rome  so he is no more thought of nor are they who delivered that City from him But  Anthony  is still alive and still in arms and still terrifies and so  Octavius  is adored who beat  Anthony  Hence it is that  Octavius  is become of such potent consequence that from his mouth the  Roman  people must expect our doom the doom of their deliverers And hence it is too that we those deliverers are of such humble consequence that he must be sup∣plicated to give us our lives  I as said have a soul and I have a sword and am an enemy to such abject supplications so great an enemy that I detest those that use them and am an avowed foe to him that expects them I shall at least be far away from the odious company of slaves and wherever I find liberty there I will find  Rome  And for you that stay behind who not satiated with many years and many honours can behold liberty extinct and virtue with us in exile and yet are not sick of a wretched and precarious life I heartily pity you For myself whose soul has never ebbed from its constant prin∣ciples I shall ever be happy in the consciousness of my virtue owing nothing to my country to∣wards which I have faithfully discharged my duty I shall possess my mind in peace and find the re∣ward of welldoing in the satisfaction of having  done it What greater pleasure does the world afford than to despise the slippery uncertainties of life and to value that only which is valua∣ble private virtue and public liberty that li∣berty which is the blessing and ought to be the birthright of all mankind  But still I will never sink with those who are already falling I will never yield with those who have a mind to submit I am resolved to be always firm and independent I will try all expedients I will exert my utmost prowess to banish servitude and set my country entirely free If fortune fa∣vours me as she ought the blessing and joy will be every man's but if she fail me and my best endea∣vours be thrown away yet still I will rejoice single and so far be too hard for fortune What in short can my life be better laid out in than in continual schemes and repeated efforts for the common liberty of my country  As to your part in this crisis my dear  Cicero  it is my strongest advice and request to you not to desert yourself do not distrust your ability and your ability will not disappoint you believe you can remedy our heavy evils and you will remedy them Our miseries want no increase prevent there∣fore by your vigilance any new accession Formerly in quality of consul you defeated with great bold∣ness and warmth for liberty a formidable conspira∣cy against  Rome  and saved the commonwealth and what you did then against  Cataline  you do still against  Anthony  These actions of yours have raised your reputation high and spread it far but it will be all tarnished or lost if you do not continue to shew an equal firmness upon as great an occasion let this render all the parts of your life equal and secure immortality to that glory of yours which ought to be immortal  From those who like you have performed great actions as great or greater are expected  by shewing that they can serve the public they make themselves its debtors and it is apt to exact strict payment and to use them severely if they do not pay But from those who have performed no such actions we expect none This is the di∣fference betwixt the lot of unknown talents and of those which have been tried and the condition of the latter is no doubt the harder Hence it is that though in making head against  Anthony  you have merited and received great and just praises yet you have gained no new admiration By so doing you only continued like a worthy consular the known character of a great and able consul But if now at last you begin to truckle to one as bad as he if you abate ever so little in that vigour of mind and that steady courage by which you expelled him from the senate and drove him out of  Rome  you will never reap another harvest of glory whatever you may deserve and even your past laurels will wither and your past renown be forgot  There is nothing great or noble in events which are the fruit of passion or chance True fame refults only from the steady perseverance of reason in the paths and pursuits of virtue The care therefore of the commonwealth and the defence of her liberties belong to you above all men because you have done more than all men for liberty and the commonwealth Your great abi∣lities your known zeal your famous actions with the united call and expectation of all men are your motives in this great affair would you have greater  You are not therefore to supplicate  Octavius  for our safety do a braver thing owe it to your own magnanimity Rouse the  Roman  genius within you

what they scarce dare to think  CHURCHILL  THE MARINE REPUBLIC  A Certain man having many sons all bred to a seafaring life was desirous that they should live together in a just brotherly and social man∣ner and that though he wished to encourage in∣dividual industry and improvement in abilities by providing that every one should reap the fruits of the same yet was he determined to form their plan of union in such a manner that none not even their children should be so depressed as to be excluded from the common benefits of their birthright and of an equal token of the impartial regard of their common parent Wherefore one day having called his sons together he addressed them to this effect  My dear boys my beha∣viour and conduct towards you has always been such as to convince you I was strictly just and impartial You were all equally my delight and care in your infancy you have been equally provided with the means of education and with every comfort and convenience I have  shewn no partiality to any as being older or younger I have been in all respects your common parent and I wish you and your children to live together as my common children for ever for I extend my parental regard to your offspring through every generationBehold then this gallant ship equipt and provided with every thing necessary for sea her rigging and tackle all of the best materials and admirably adapted to the ocean you have to occupy amply provid∣ed with stores and provisions for a long voyage and waiting only for intelligent and skilful agents to conduct her whithersoever they will You my dear boys are such agents sufficiently qualified for the adventurous task  Accept then my sons of this my precious gift but remember I do not give it to one or two or a select few but to you all and as many of your posterity as shall sail therein as a  COMMON PROPERTY  You shall be all  EQUAL OWNERS  and shall share the profits of every voyage equally among you  You shall chuse from among yourselves one fit to be captain another to be mate another carpenter cThese officers shall continue in office while you please and and when you please you shall change them for others that your affairs may be conducted in the best manner possible At the end of the voy∣age or at other stated times agreed upon you shall settle your accounts and after paying the captain the mate and every other officer and man his wages according to station and agree∣ment and all bills for upholding wear and tear provisions c then the remainder which is the neat profit of the voyage and which would been mine had I retained the property of the ship in my own hands is now  your  common property and must be shared equally among you all without respect to any office any any one may have held For as I make you all  equal owners so shall you be equal sharers in the profits of each voyage You are all equal to me and you shall be all equal in this respect to each other Let not the captain who re∣ceives the wages of a captain or any other offi∣cer who receives the wages of his station mur∣mer that his brethren before the mast and who receive only the wages of common men should receive share and share alike with himself of the profits No my dear children let no such un∣just and unbrotherly grudging ever he found among you  Again my sons as I have been just and im∣partial to you be ye the same to  your  children And when they shall multiply so that you can∣not all sail together in the same vessel provide another ship out of your common profits for such of yourselves and your sons as shall chuse to sail together which shall be their common property in the same manner as this ship is yours This do and live like men and brethren through all generations And as a swarm of bees when grown too numerous for one hive send off colonies to people new ones so when the  e  s of your ships become too numerous let new ships be built and manned on the same equitable plan that I have done and my blessing go with you  These injunctions were received by the young men with inexpressible joy And having wrote them they were called the constitution of their MARINE REPUBLIC and swore to maintain them inviolate to the end of time They then chose a captain and other officers and proceeded on a trading voyage and being prosperous they shared very considerable dividends both at the end of this and many future voyages  In process of time however it so happened that these marine republicans were dissatisfied with  the government of the country in which they resided Wherefore taking all their families and all their effects on board they set sail for America where they expected to see government administer∣ed more agreeably to their notions of equality and equity But a violent storm arising they were driven far out of their course and at last arrived at an uninhabited island of a luxurious soil and an agreeable climate Here they gladly landed after much danger and their ship being so damaged as to be no more fit for sea they determined to settle on the island The ship was now broke up and houses built with the materials and preparations were made to cultivate the soil as they must now think of living by gardening and agriculture But they foresaw that if they did not apply the Marine Constitution given them by their father to their landed property they would soon experience in∣expressible inconveniences They therefore de∣clared the property of the island to be the proper∣ty of them all collectively in the same manner as the ship had been and that they ought to share the profits thereof in the same way The island they named Spensonia after the name of the ship which their father had given them They next chose officers to mark out such portions of land as every person or family desired to occupy for which they were to receive for the use of the public a certain rent according to its value This rent was applied to public uses or divided among themselves as they thought proper But in order to keep up the remembrance of their rights they decreed that they should never fail to share at renttime an equal dividend though ever so small and though public demands should be ever so urgent  They now spread considerably over the country and houses and workshops were built at the public expence The space inhabited became too exten∣sive for one district wherefore they divided it into  many and called them parishes As they had de∣termined when seamen that every succeeding ship they should build and man should according to their father's maxim be the property of the crew so in conformity therewith they decreed that every district or parish which they should people should be the property of the inhabitants and the rents and police of the same at their disposal Thus they live in union and equality on land as their father intended they should do on sea and frame and people new parishes at the public ex∣pence as he designed they should build new ships A national assembly or congress consisting of dele∣gates from all the parishes takes care of their na∣tional concerns and defrays the expences of state and matters of common utility by a pound rate from each parish without any other tax  A LESSON FOR LEGISLATORS AND PEOPLE  From the Querist by the Bishop of Cloyne  WHETHER frugal fashions in the upper rank and comfortable living in the lower be not the means to multiply the inhabitants  Provided the wheels move whether it is not the same thing as to the effect of the machine be this done by the force of wind or water or animals  Whether a single hint be sufficient to overcome a prejudice and whether even obvious truths will not sometimes bear repeating  Whether a country inhabited by a people well fed clothed and lodged would not become every day more populous and whether a numerous stock of people in such circumstances would not constitute a fluorishing nation and how far the  product of our own country may suffice for the compassing this end  Whether a people who had provided themselves with the necessaries of life in good plenty  would not soon extend their industry to new arts and new branches of commerce  Whether it be not a sure sign or effect of a country's thriving to see it well cultivated and full of inhabitants  Whether large farms under few hands or small ones under many are likely to be made most of  Whether a woman of fashion ought not to be de∣clared a public enemy  When the root vieldeth insufficient nourishment whether men do not top the tree to make the lower branches thrive  Whether the vanity and luxury of a few ought to stand in competition with the interest of a nation  Whether hungry cattle will not leap over bounds  Whether every enemy to learning is not a Goth and whether every such Goth among us be not an enemy to the country  Whether therefore it would not be an omen of ill presage a dreadful phenomenon in the land if our great men should take it into their heads to deride learning and education  Whether we may  with better grace sit down and complain when we have done all in our power to help ourselves  Whether it be not delightful to complain and whether there be not many who had rather utter their complaints than re  ress their evils  Whether as seed equally scattered produceth a good harvest even so an equal distribution of wealth does not cause a nation to flourish  Whether it would be a great hardship if every parish were obliged to find work for the poor  Whether there can be a worse sign than that people should quit their country for a livelihood though men often leave their country for health or pleasure or riches yet to leave it merely for a livelihood Whether this be not exceeding bad and sheweth some peculiar mismanagement  MANKIND WILL BE MORE KNOWING THAN THEIR GOVERNORS WISH THEM  From a Fast  Day Sermon by the Rev J Murray of Newcastle Author of  Sermons to Asses  Printed in  Woe to thee O Land when thy King is a Child and thy Princes eat in the Morning  Ecc e x ver  WHEN rulers are intoxicated with ideas of power and have their passions inflamed with dissipation they are ready to imagine that the whole community are as foolish a themselves and for that reason endeavour to persuade the peo∣ple that it is faction to oppose their measures and treason to maintain their own rights  Because they will not minister to the gratifi∣cation of the lusts and appetites of those who want to enslave them they are called factious and rebel∣lious It is impossible that reason can demand that government which was instituted for the good of society should be made the greatest evil and the heaviest curse It could never be the intent of the appointment of government that rulers should have a right to dispose of more than belonged to the right administration thereof With regard to ostentations splendor it adds nothing to the dig∣nity of government as a moral institution for  there is more true dignity in a magistrate executing just laws in the homespun manufacture of his own country than in one supporting unrighteous de∣crees and arbitrary authority dressed in ermine o  trimmed in gold  Mankind are not in general so ignorant as to suppose that pageantry and superstuity add dig∣nity to government and they can perceive either the fool or the villain through all the garnishing and trappings of office Neither the star nor the garter are so able to dazzle their eyes as to hinder them from perceiving the black spots that are underneath them or of discerning the wolf in sheep's cloathing Rulers fondly imagine that the people are not qualified to discern the injustice of refusing their reasonable requests and for that rea∣son sport themselves with their petitions and re∣monstrances but in this they display more their own want of judgment than the people do want of sense and understanding  It is somewhat strange that princes have not learned from experience and observation that all unnecessary expence and splendour in government are only prognostications of the downfall of states and forerunners of their ruin The History of the sour great Monarchies may serve to instruct all future generations of the folly of pageantry and the unnecessary expence in the government of na∣tions Luxury and dissipation has generally pro∣duced a define of dominion and made princes neglect paying a just regard to the complaints and grievances of their subjects for they have been for the most part fondest of dominion when they were least fit to govern and near to their downfall  It is undoubtedly a woeful thing to a nation to be obliged to supply the extravagances of men who instead of ruling it with wisdom and justice spend the substance thereof in all the vile arts of  corruption and licentiousness And what adds to this woe is that they charge the people with being licentious after they have taken all the pains in their power to make them so  Yet bad as the people in general may be they would shudder at the thoughts of many acts of w  kedness that are committed by their superiors The cha  ge of licentiousness comes with an ill grace from those who are living constantly in the  of both divine and human laws and lave nothing to save them from punishment ex∣  ept the partiality of government and the indul∣g  ce of divine mercy  With regard to the charge of faction and rebel∣l  on which arbitrary rulers bring against the peo∣ple it may be returned upon themselves where these crimes are oftener to be found than among the people It must proceed from their not know∣ing what is the nature of rebellion that they do not take the charge home to themselves  The prophet Isaiah will help them to understand what is properly rebellion  Thy princes are rebel∣lious and the companions of thieves every one loveth gifts and followeth after rewards they judge not the fatherless neither does the cause of the widow come be∣fore them  A NEW SONG IN PRAISE OF Our Noble King and Happy Constitution  Tune"Malbrouk"  By

Grace the DUKE of RICHMOND to the Chairman of a Meeting of the County of Sussex convened at Lewes Janu∣ary for the purpose of presenting a petition to the House of Commons to take into consideration the unequal state of Representation in Parliament  Whitehall  January  SIR  YOU may casily believe that being one of those who joined in requesting you to call a county meeting nothing but illness can pre∣vent me attending it and it is with infinite regret I submit to the decision of my physicians who pronounce that it is not safe for me to leave Lon∣don  I trust that my sentiments on the subject of  Parliamentary Reform  are in general sufficiently known and that without further assurances I might be  depended upon for giving it every support in my power  but some circumst  nces make me wish to state them as briefly as possible to the county of Sussex They are formed on the  experience of twentysix years  which whether in or out of government has equally convinced me that the  Restoration of a genuine House of Commons  by a  renovation  of the  Rights of the People  is the  only essential remedy  against that  system of corruption  which has brought the na∣tion to disgrace and poverty and threatens it with the  loss of liberty  I take the grievance of the present state of election to be its  gross inequality  All the electors in Great Britain do not amount to  onesixth  part of the whole people and a still greater inequality subsists in elections made by that sixth part for  oneseventh part of them  elect a majority so that  onefortysecond  part of the nation dispose of the  pro∣perty  of the whole  and have their  lives and liberties at conv  ad  And this fortysecond part far from consisting of the most opulent part of the kingdom is composed of the small boroughs most of which are become either the private property of indivi∣duals or are notoriously sold to the best bidder so that counties and great cities are in fact as well as the great mass of the people swallowed up by this  system of corruption  My ideas of reform undoubtedly go to one that shall be  complete and general throughout the king∣dom  I see such fatal consequences arise from the present partial and accidental state of election that I cannot take upon me to propose any new mode that partakes of the same defects If we do not differ from the  abettors of corruption  upon the broad principle of equality in election and the  universal right of the people to be represented  and are contend∣ing only for a degree of partiality more or less I fear our ground is not found if we mean only to substitute partiality for partiality and are strug∣gli  g but for its extent one man's whim may be as good as another's conceit and we have nothing certain to direct us and if inequality is still to subsist the advocates of the present system will have the sanction of time and the risk of changes to oppose to us which will have their weight when it is but for a change of partiality that we contend  I have thought that a  Parliamentary Reform  has much more simple and unerring guides to lead us to our end I mean the  true principles of the Consti∣tution  and the  Rights of the People  If these exist I do not consider myself at liberty to speculate upon system I have no choice but to give to every man his own  How far it is wise for those who entirely agree in principle upon the  Rights of Men  to endeavour to persuade them that the  recovery of their birthrights  and most essential interests  "are not reducible to practice nor attainable by any regular or constitu∣tional efforts of theirs" is what I must leave others to determine But the truth of this assertion is what I can never subscribe to I cannot but think that this nation ever has it in its own power by  ful and constitutional efforts to do i  s If justice  and that nothing can rende attemp  s for this purpose impracticable but either a  general ind  lence  an  i  ∣di  erence to all that requires exertion  though for the  est purposes  or prejudice to favourite systems as shall divide the people  To guard again  such an imputation falling on me I most readily agree to an address in the most general terms not pointing to any specific mode of reform in the petition or by instructions to our members or by resolutions but submitting the re∣medy as in my opinion it ought to be  in the first instance to Parliament itself which I con∣ceive to be as equal to such a consideration as any Provincial Committee  Should Mr WYVIL'S first or second plan be proposed in Parliament or any thing like it al∣though I shall lament that we s  r a moment quit our advantageous ground of the  Constitution  and the  Rights of Men  yet I shall certainly give every support in my power to this or any other amend∣ment and it certainly will be a considerable im∣provement that instead of a fortysecond it should be a thirtysixth or thi  t  eth part that shall decide the concerns of the whole people It will be some∣thing material they will have gained and may be∣come a step to the more easy attainment of their privileges  I must sincerely hope that that plan may be found attainable but I never can consent to tell the people and I hope to God they never will be∣lieve that the recovery of any right which Nature and the Constitution have given them is impracti∣cable  On the contrary convinced myself I wish them ever to believe that whenever they please to claim they  will  and  m  st  have the  full extent of their rights  I have thought e  ess  y to say thus much on  impression I cannot think indifferent the pub∣lic should entertain  The measure for which you are assembled meets with my hearty concurrence and I shall be happy if these my sentiments which I beg you would communicate to the meeting of the county of Sussex  should meet with their approbation  It is with the highest esteem and regard that I have the honour to be SIR  Your most obedient and humble servant RICHMOND c  To  W  m Franckland  Esq "High Sheriff of the county of Sussex"  The time is now come for men to be provided with prin∣ciples of practical utility  From a Pamphlet entitled Sins of the Nation  THE course of events in this country has now for a number of generations for a long reach as it were of the stream of time run smooth and our political duties have been proportionably easy but it may not always be so A sudden bend may change the direction of the current and open scenes less calm It becomes every man therefore to examine his principles whether they are of that firmness and texture as suits the occasion he may have for them If we want a light gondola to float upon a summer lake we look at the form and gilding but if a vessel to steer through storms  we examine the strength of the timbers and the soundness of the bottom We want principles not to figure in a Book of Ethies or to delight us with "grand and swelling sentiments" but principles by which we may act▪ and by which we may suffer Principles of ben volence to dispose us to real sacrifices political principles of practi∣cal utility principles of religion to comfort and support us under all the trying vicissitudes we see around us and which we have no security that we shall be long exempt from How many are there now suffering under such overwhelming dis∣tresses as a short time ago we should have thought it was hardly within the verge of possibility that they should experience Above all let us keep our hearts pure and our hand clean Whatever part we take in public affairs much will undoubt∣edly happen which we could by no means foresee and much which we shall not be able to justify the only way therefore by which we can avoid deep remorse is to act with simplicity and single∣ness of intention and not to suffer ourselves to be warped though by ever so little from the path which honour and conscience approve  OF THE HERIDITARY NOBILITY  By the Author of a Plea for a Commonwealth  THE third and last sort of men that seem by their interest prompted to an enmity to and opposition of an equal Commonwealth is the he∣riditary Nobility whose apprehensions being swell∣ed and elated with the greatness of their titles and cherishing a fond opinion of the gallantry of their blood think it below them to stand on an equal level with the rest of their breth  en I confess were there on the face of the earth according to the fictions of the poets a race of heroes that were of the kindred of  Jupiter  and could deduce their  pedigrees from the Gods whose natures had es∣caped the general po  tion or been less tainted with human infirmities than other mortals whose bodies had been framed by  Titan  of better clay and a more refined mould than the rest of the rude moss of mankind▪ and whose parts and intellects as its said of  a  were higher by the head and shoulders than the rest of the people whereby it might be envidenced nature had designed them unto rule and empire there were then some plea some ground for that distinction the tyranny of custom hath introduced among the children of men  But if these pyramids of greatness were at first erected by the hands of monarchy only for the better support and on ament of the thrones of princes and are if well understood no other than golden trophies made of the spoils and ruins of the people's liberties that not only in fair cha∣racters preserve the memories of their oppressors but also upb  d them with their former if not present se  vi  de and slavery I cannot but think it might  con  uce to the security of the peace and  ty of the nation▪ to have them removed out of the people's eves that they may neither longer continue the objects of their envy who hate them or by d  z  ling with their gawdy splendor the weak eves of food a  rers▪ revive and awaken the memories and desires of what they sometime were the appurtenances and appendix or if they are  s by some pretended the very pillars and buttresses of  the ba  warks and citadels of pri  and ty  ny▪ and  t notwithstanding the s  rd of r  al po  er be taken down  This F  k  in the time of the Commonwealth  the pence and  o  rty of the  tion seems not suffici∣ently  or to  e  ine  a full and per∣fect conq  oppres  n while any of the for  es  which it hath formerly been ingarri∣son  o  not  is  antled it were bet∣ter that these should  b  te something of their  height and grandeur that seems to overtop and threaten ruin to the public liberty than that the nation should be put in danger of relapsing into slavery or to have their controversy so lately de∣cided by the umpire of heaven again disputed in fields of blood  Or if these swelling tumours and unhandsome wens of greatness do ill become the face of a com∣monwealth and spoil the symmetry and beauty of its proportions were it not better they should be pared off than our state rendered of a monstrous and prodigious shape If after all our expence of blood and treasure for purchase of our liberty our title and pretensions to a free state may justly be called in question so long as we remain pupils and under wardship to our hereditary lords and antient guardians is it not time we were emancipated or if that may not in truth be admitted for an equal commonwealth in which there is any other path known to the temple of honour than what passes through that of virtue Is it not prudence to hedge up all those byeways of birth and fortunes Were it not better the system of our polity and govern∣ment should be plainly penned without the flou∣rishes and ornaments of such capitals which being admitted may either seem superfluous or through misconstruction endanger marring the sense or rendering the nature of our constitution dubious and ambiguous than by a contrary practice minister occasion of entangling men's judgments with such scruples knots and difficulties that the best state critics being unable to untie nothing but the sharpest sword can out ins  nder I would not wil∣lingly be understood to plead against all distinction of ranks and degrees amongst men in which con∣sists the harmony grace and beauty of the world and which cannot be proscribed or abolished with∣out confounding the oeconomy and order of all so∣cieties without unlinking the chain of nature  without cancelling and reversing the law of the universe and unrolling the world into its first chaos of confusion nor should I speak a syllable against honours being hereditary could the valour religion and prudence of ancestors be as easily entailed on a line or family as their honours and riches could but their gallantry be made hereditary as well as their fortunes Could they transmit their virtues as well as names unto their posterity I should willingly become the advocate of such a nobility and suffer my ears to be bored to the posts of their doors and rather acknowledge them our perpetual masters and dictators than hazard the choice of worse upon the doubtful election of the people with whom the best men are not always in greatest reputation  But since no choice can be more perilous and unsafe than the casual lot of nature I had rather stand to any election than mere chance by rea∣son we have oftener known fools the sons of wise men by nature than of the peoples choice or adop∣tion Honour is the crown and reward of virtue is it not then unseemly they should wear the badge and livery that were never admitted within the utmost court of her temple that are the very slaves and vassals of vice and wickedness I cannot but pay a greater tribute of respect and honour in my thoughts to the worth of such as have raised themselves to a high degree and pitch of emi∣nence by the wings of their own merits than to such as are only borne up by those the credit and reputation of their ancestors hath bequeathed unto them wherefore that honour may be a spur to valour and the reward of virtue let it not be prostrated to every rich and sordid miser who by abandoning all virtue hospitality and humanity hath with much oppression and grinding the face of the poor scraped much wealth together but rather on such as by their valour and prudence  have brought most credit and reputation to the commonwealth wherefore if the parliament please out of such to create knights or make the chiefest ministers of state lords by office or during life I should account it no solecism in a commonwealth but an ornament thereto  Now the reason I look upon the divine the lawyer and hereditary nobility as such irrecon∣cileable antagonists to a free state is not grounded singly on the real prejudice they either have or are like to receive therefrom but rather on what their fears and jealousies are apt to suggest upon their apprehensions being conscious that their pri∣vate interests stand in opposition to that of the pub∣lic which could they be content to let go and wave the advantages an injurious prescription hath given them over their brethren their concerns would be equally interwoven and wound up with others in that of a commonwealth and might find it alike propitious to themselves with any other of like parts and ingenuity but such is the evil na∣ture of man that to have done an injury is a suf∣ficient ground for future enmity and rather to pro∣secute than any way compensate those that are in∣debted for a former discourtesy therefore the best and the soonest way to be reconciled to such is quickly to requite their injury for measuring others thirst of revenge by the standard of their own malice they can never believe any one is friends with them so long as he is in arrears to them for an ill turn so that their fear of revenge breeds distance and that encreases alienation and disaffection which brings forth farther hostility with encrease of injuries In analogy to which doctrine the best way to give the antagonists of the commonwealth ease and its self security is by causing their fears to fall upon them and thereby deliver them from further pain and the public from its jealousies and future danger for it can  never be expected they should espouse the interest of the public before they have buried that of their private that they should embark themselves in the same bottom with that of the commonwealth so long as they have so many of their own to look after till these are shipwrecked they will not be much concerned in the safety and prosperity of the commonwealth  We shall never be so well united in our affec∣tions and designs for public good as when we are become all of one piece and to have but one com∣mon interest for it is nothing but the diversity of interests that breaks us in pieces and crumbles us into so many different factions and designs which as it was good policy in our monarchs so but bad prudence in a commonwealth the interest of a prince being to break the strength of his people that one faction being balanced by another he may with more ease and facility render himself master of all according to the advice of the old maxim  Divide and Rule  But the strength and glory of a commonwealth is its union And indeed it had otherwise been impossible that ever princes should have been able to have tied up the hands of na∣tions and bound the strength of  Sampson  in cords and bands of withies had not their policy like that of the  Philistines  first shorn their locks and de∣prived them of their strength had they not first according to the fable of the faggot loosed their bond of union by starting many interests and kindling divers animosities among them they had never fastened the cords of slavery and bondage on them The  Philistines  had never sported them∣selves with  Sampson  or  Ulisses  with  Polyphemas  had they not first put out their eyes Nor had  Princes  ever put a hook into the nostrils of the Leviathan or played with the mighty Whale had they not made use of a like stratagem  Men complain much and seem to have a great sense of the many factions and divisions in religion as they are pleased to term them but how incon∣siderable are these to the grand national or civil factions I confess those of religion may sometime be made use of to palliate but there are other fac∣tions that are the bitter root of all our breaches and divisions were there not one interest of the no∣bility another of the commonalty one of the cler∣gy another of the laity one of the lawyer another of the countryman one of the soldier another of the citizen one of the elder another of the younger brethren we might soon see an end of the other  These are the interests that clash so much one against another and make such tumults in the world and were these once cancelled and for∣gotten the other of Presbyterian and independent Quaker and Anabaptist c would soon vanish or at least make little noise or disturbance in the world How happy might all men be did it please God they might recover the sight of their common interest and their strength which consists in union How easily might all the nations of the earth shake off the iron yokes the tyranny of princes hath put upon them by this means and with how great facility might this be done with how little pre∣judice and det  ent to any man's particular might all be made happy if laying aside all animosities and jealousies men would but lend an ear to rea∣son rather than passion But to proceed since it hath pleased God once more to put a price into our hands and cause another opportunity of recover∣ing our native rights and liberties to dawn upon us I desire we may not be as fools not knowing how to use it but that all ways that are safe and honourable may be taken for the securing and im∣provement of it and therefore that the builders of our state may be furnished with a spirit of wis∣dom  from above that they may become  the repairers of our breaches  and  the restorers of paths to dwell in  that they may not deceive themselves or the na∣tion by thinking to patch up a sorry halfpotched commonwealth upon the old crazy and rotten foundations of monarchy as heretofore having had experience that it will not it cannot stand They that are best read in politics and have been most conversant in the histories of antiquity know that as a commonwealth is the best and most abso∣late form of government so it is a nice and tick∣  sh thing and hath been difficult to fix in nations under less disadvantage than we who have been so long used to a contrary way of government which I speak not to discourage but rather awaken the endeavours and resolutions of our senators to watch and secure our liberties The ancient com∣monwealths have been necessitated to make use sometimes of violent physic to purge and evacuate the rank humours of the body politic and such as I would not have prescribed a christian state sup∣posing there may be found out such as are more  e and gentle It was the unhappiness of the Grecian and Roman republic to be often guilty of the gre  test ingratitude towards them that best de∣served of them and not unoften to stain their hands with their bloods whose former merits seemed to challenge a crown rather than a cross from them How often hath  Greece  for the secu∣rity of her liberty sacrificed that life by which she hath formerly been preserved from ruin and destruction Who hath not heard of the unhappy tragedy of that valiant captain that more than once preserved the capitol and snatched  Rome  as a prey out of the very tecth of the  Gauls  its barba∣rous and at last fatal enemies And how often hath  Greece  rewarded her captains victories with banishment instead of triumphs and that upon the single account of some small suggestion of jea∣lousy  or weak argument of too great magnificence or popularity so jealous were those republics of their liberty that the general of an army durst not make use of a little plate in his house lest it should cause envy or render him suspected of too much grandeur and ambition and that he endeavoured to supplant the commonwealth and render himself their lord and master Others have been constrained to level their palaces with the ground lest the sumptuousness and magnificence of their structure should become the object of the people's envy and hatred When these things come into my mind I cannot but wonder any should think it so easy and facile a thing to erect a commonwealth as that it may be done with a wet finger and requires no more then inserting  the keepers of the liberties  in∣stead of the name  king  and that then the work is finished without any farther trouble or alteration as may seem to be of opinion I confess had we not at so dear a rate bought experience to inform us of the contrary this mistake might have past for venial but that makes it an unpardonable error  A NEW SONG  Tune  "God

Jars  FRENCHMEN are FREE  A few Queries to the Methodists in general  ESPECIALLY TO THE TEACHERS AMONGST THAT PEOPLE  As well as to every other consciencious Member of the Church of England  By THOMAS BENTLY  QUERY I  WERE not the Kings of Judea under the Mo∣saic dispensation intitled to as much re∣spect and reverence as any line of Kings that ever reigned in this or any other country that we have an account of and yet did not all the preachers or prophets from Samuel even to Jeremiah use the most plain severe condemning and reprobating language to such of them as acted contrary to truth and righteousness according to the degree of their deviation from the law of God  QUERY II  Were not the Priests in Christ's time allowed by the Romans to exercise authority in things be∣longing to the Temple and the worship of God as descendants of the ancient Levitical priesthood so that they were in fact the chief  Jewish  Magistrates then remaining and yet did not Christ himself  use as severe and threatening language to them as Isarah Jeremiah and Ezekiel c had done to the former Kings and Priests and surely it is no more a sin at this time to call a King a Robber or a Fox or a devouring Lion than it was in the days of Jeremiah or Jesus Christ or the apostle Paul  QUERY III  Does not the Scriptures both of the Old and New Testament teach us that there is but one way of salvation for all men that is the way of truth righteousness holiness selfdenialin other words regenerationthe loving God with all our hearts and our neighbour as ourselvesor doing in all things as we would be done unto and do they not further assure us that God is no respec∣tor of persons but will as surely destroy a wicked  King  as a wicked  Beggar  QUERY IV  Are not pride covetuousness oppression and pleasure sins which separate from God as well as lying stealing drunkenness or whoredom and will you say that people who don't like the poor to come near them either in the church the house or the street but chuse to wear jewels and laces and embroidered cloaths or to use grand and cost∣ly furniture and equipages c  are not proud  or will you say that "laying up gold and sil∣ver like dust" or buying one House and Farm af∣ter another while thousands of poor are perishing for want of education instruction and the neces∣saries of life  is not oppression and covetousness  or may a person frequent plays operas balls masque∣rades cardtables horseraces huntingmatches and such like vanities without deserving the cha∣racter of a  liver in pleasure  In Solomon's time the prisons were not crowded with debtors and criminals and the streets with beggars and per∣sons  destitute of employment as is now the case in this kingdom  QUERY V  If the present Royal Family of England are either proud or covetous or oppressors or followers of pleasure are not all who pray for them under the character of religious or gracious guilty of their blood as well as mockers of God and if a person flatter a wicked Governor is he not also an enemy to his country by encouraging that Ruler to go on in his wickedness oppression and bad example Jer c  QUERY VI  Will not a Man's telling a wilful lie to gain £ as surely condemn him as if he told one to gain £ and is it not surely a lie which a church of England Minister tells when he declares all the children which he baptizes to be then born again or regenerated by the holy Spirit of God as when a minister of the church of Rome declares that a piece of bread is changed into the very body of Jesus Christ and is it not as shameful a deception in a protestant parson to bury a wicked man in sure and certain hope of eternal life as it is in a popish priest to grant him indulgence or absolution while he is yet living or has a British reprobate any more right to the communion table than a  Romish  one  QUERY VII  Does not both reason and revelation teach us that in order to lay the axe to the  root  of the tree of wickedness we must begin with kings and princes and bishops and priests so long as an Eli is priest or an Ahaz king wickedness and destruction covers the land but let a Samuel take the place of Eli or Hezekiah of Ahaz and then righteous∣ness and peace runs down like a riverwhy is  it then that you seem blind to the sins of the great  does not the gospel afford them a possibility of eternal life  or can  even they  be saved in any other path than that of JUSTICE MERCY and HUMI∣LITY  QUERY VIII  Does not reason and revelation teach us that though a degree of affliction or chastisement is sometimes good for us yet an  excessive  weight of it is apt to drive us to despair and desperate courses "My feet says David had nearly slipt" We know also how hardly Job was put to it to stand Augur says "give me not poverty want of necessaries lest I steal" Also Solomon "oppression maketh even a wise man mad" And another "the rod of the wicked shall not  rest  upon the lot of the righteous lest even the righteous put forth his hand unto iniquity" With other passages of the same importNor I wou'd ask if pride and plea∣sure and covetuousness does not naturally occasion an advance of rents and taxes and consequently of all the necessaries of life and does not that ad∣vance first and most heavily fall upon the poor and are not many poor children thereby deprived of education and many young men and women prevented from marrying and many fathers and mothers hindered from attending upon religious meetings and conversations and driven for bread into bye paths and crooked ways which they are ashamed of and would not willingly have trod in and does not grandeur and luxury and oppres∣sion and pleasure rise higher and higher in one part of the community whilst robbery and whore∣dom and drunkenness and insolvency increase in the same proportion in the other and yet you continue to say "our gracious King"  THE RIGHTS OF SWINE AN ADDRESS TO THE POOR  Be careful to withold  Your talons from the wretched and the bold  Tempt not the  brave  and  needy  to despair  For though your violence should leave them bare  Of gold and silver  swords  and  darts  remain  And will revenge the wrongs which they sustain  The plundered  still  have arms  STEP JUV  HARD indeed must be the heart which is un∣affected with the present distress experienced by the Poor in general in this commercial nation Thousands of honest and industrious people in Great Britain are literally starving for want of bread and the cause invariably assigned is a stag∣nant commerce My opinion on this subject will perhaps appear to some a strange phenomenait is that a stagnant commerce is not the real cause of the want of the necessaries of life among the labo∣rious poor And I am confident that while the "Earth yields her increase" there is a method founded on JUSTICE and REASON to prevent the poor from wanting bread be the state of trade whatever it may  In the first place then I will ask What are the principle sources of human subsistence Certain∣ly Corn and Grass Corn is moulded into many shapes for the use of man but chiefly into bread which is the staff of life and from grass we de∣rive our flesh milk butter cheese c besides wool and leather which I think with the addi∣tion of coal and a few other minerals nearly make up the real necessaries of life  I ask again then who is so infatuated as to say  that the growing of corn or grass is dependant on or connected with the prosperity or adversity of trade Certainly thank Heaven they are not affected by the devouring sword or ruined com∣merce except at the seat of warCorn grows not in the loom nor Grass upon the anvil Why is it then that while there is plenty of bread the poor are starving Is there not as much grain and grass in the land as when the trade flourished Suppose trade were to rise immediately to an amazing de∣gree would it make one grain of corn or blade of grass more Certainly not Why then I ask again are the poor who are the peculiar care of HIM who delights to do his needy creatures good not satisfied with the good of the land  The following reasons are at least satisfactory to myselfBecause in the time of national pros∣perity house and land rent consequently provi∣sions are always raised by the wealthy and volup∣tuous till they are at least at par with high wa∣ges but when WAR or any other cause has ruin∣ed or impeded commerce and reduced wages  rents  and  provisions  remain unabated The poor calico weavers in the vicinity of Manchester notoriously illustrate this argument as they are now they who can get any working for fifty and sixty per cent less wages than at this time two years back and the necessaries of life are rather agumented in their prices than diminished  Hearken O ye poor of the Land While great men have an unbounded power to raise  their  rents and  your  provisionsand at the same time an un∣controuled power to make  War  and consequently to dry up or diminish the scources of your income your subsistance will at the best be precarious and your very existence often miserableThe present want of Bread and Butcher's Meat amongst the Poor is not owing to the want of Grain of Grass in the world nor I presume in this Land  but owing to the price of it being excessively above the price of labour When therefore the price of labour cannot be brought up to the rate of pro∣visions provisions should be reduced to the rate of labour Till this is practicable the poor are mi∣serable  During the last twenty years mechanical wages have been varied according to circumstances seve∣ral times and not unusually in some branches twenty thirty forty and even fifty per cent I mean on the lowering as well as the rising side of the medium But with regard to  landrent  its variations have always been progressive and to find a single instance to the contrary would be al∣most if not altogether impossible  It requires but little sagacity to see that the game laws riot act laws against vagrants and felons c c are made chiefly for the security of the  rich  against the depredations of the  poor  But what security have the  poor  against the op∣pression and extortion of the  rich  Certainly none at all As every comfort of life is derived from land and as the rich are the proprietors thereof it may in some sense be said that they hold the issues of life and death and whilst they can uninter∣ruptedly raise their rents without limitation or re∣straint they have an alarming and unbounded power over not only the happiness but even the  lives  of the great mass of the peoplethe  poor  If then statesmen have a right to advance their lands in times of prosperity the  poor  ought to have a parliament of their  own chusing  invested with power to reduce them in days of adversity This balance of power between the  rich  and the  poor  would be productive of a thousand times more con∣solation to this nation than the chimerical non∣sense of courtjugglers  "the balance of power in Eu∣rope"  Nor can I imagine that any judicious per∣son would call such a power in parliament unjust  or irrational which when exercised could rum none but bless millions if it would be cruel to make a statesman of twenty thousand pounds per annum live a year or two upon ten thousand pounds how much more remorseless is it to make the Spi∣talfield and Norwich weavers as well as some hun∣dred thousands more live upon nothingor what is little better upon  charity  Besides it is a cu∣rious truth that the very superfluities which ruin hundreds of the voluptuous great would render happy the innumerable unhappy part of mankind  GREAT GOD What spectacle so affecting to a reflecting mind as Great Britain in her present stateOn the one hand we see the impudent nobles advertising their  "grand dinners"  AN AMERICAN ANECDOTE  An Indian who lately came to one of the American settlements to barter away his furs had beads and other small trinkets deli∣vered to him wrapt up in pieces of English newspapers Curious to know what was going on in this country he asked a trader WHO COULD READ to explain the contents The first para∣graph was"Yesterday his majesty aceompanied by Lord C and Lord W and several other noblemen and gentlemen took the diversion of hunting" The next "The Windsor hunt was last week most numerously attended"this was followed by "The Dutchess of Gordon's SUPERB dinner attended by all the cabinet ministers except three who had unfortunately SPLEN∣DID dinners at their own houses the same evening but for these gentlemen her grace has declared her intention of having a mag∣nificient feast next week" The next paragraph was dated from Yorkshire and gave a long account of Colonel Thornton's hounds having run a fox more than miles The reader was going on with the relation of several other dinners for LORDS and COMMONS when the Indian interrupting him cried out "Stop let me hear no moreI see that in what you call a civilized country and boast so much about the whole business of life is the same as with usHUNTING and FEASTING"  in the very face of the hungry poor whom they have ruined On the other hand widows orphans and others are weeping and often dying for want of bread What can be more odious in the sight of Heaven than feast and famine in the same na∣tion  Yet this is literally the case in this kingdom at this moment and not only in the nation but in every town in every street yea often under the same roof  Open your eyes O ye poor of the land in vain are your hands and your mouths openDo you not see how you are cajoled and degraded by the paltry subscriptions made for you at different times and in various parts of the nation which serve only to make your slavery more servile and base and your misery of longer duration I revere generous subscribers and collectors but I scorn the means Ye poor take a farther look into your rights and you will see that upon the principles of reason and justice every peaceable and useful person has a right yea a  "divine right"  to be satisfied with the good of the land † Besides is it not monstrous∣ly provoking to be robbed by wholesale and re∣lieved by retail Look again and you will see that public collections subscriptions and charities are nothing more than the appendages of corruption extortion and oppression If the benevolent fa∣ther of the universe did not send amongst mankind provisions enough and more than enough and run∣ning over such is the waste of the great and the gluttonous that many of you poor would get none at all Say not therefore ye oppressed  "there is a famine or scarcety of provisions in this land"  It would be false The land contains plenty and  f provisions were as they ought to be reduced to your wages you would enjoy your unquestion∣able right a comfortable sufficiency  But besides the destruction of your trade and the means of subsistence you have the mortifica∣tion to see your bread eaten by dragoon and hunting horses spaniels c and your parental affectionate loving provident and tender guar∣dians can give you a good reason whyit is their own  Hearken O ye poor of the land Do you fret and whine at oppression"yes""Then as ye do so did your fathers before you"and if you  do no more  your children may whine after you Awake Arise arm yourselveswith truth jus∣tice and reasonlay siege to corruption and your unity and invincibility shall teach your oppressors terrible thingsPurge the representation of your countryclaim as your inalienable right univer∣sal suffrage and annual parliaments And when∣ever you have the gratification to chuse a repre∣sentative let him be from among the lower order of men and he will know how to sympathize with you and represent yon in characterThen and not till then shall you experience universal peace and incessant plenty  A FRIEND TO THE POOR  THE RIGHTS OF MAN FIRST PUBLISHED IN THD YEAR  By T SPENCE  Tune  "ChevyChase"  ALL you who wonder at the times  That they so hard do grow  Come hither listen unto me  And you the cause shall know  O Muses your assistance lend  While such things I rehearse  As neither goose nor eagle's wing  F'er wrote in prose or verse  Man nothing less than lord was made  For nothing less was meant  That all things else he should subdue  He to the world was sent  But not content with this large sway  Their brethren  Men  subdue  And all the godlike race is made  Subservient to a few  O earth and heaven and all therein  Your wonder high express  That rational beings like  dumb brutes  Ought earthly should depress  Yet so it is that worse than they  Nought nat'ral they can claim  Nor hip nor haw nor nut nor sloe  Nor ought that you can name  If grass or nettles they could eat  The same would be deny'd  For my lord's land and herbage reach  Close to the highway side  'A  Hare  or  partridge  they may dress  They're nature's common gift'  My Lords ground fed them why should he  Of his RIGHTS be bereft  'To fish then you will them allow  The river's not my Lord's'  Do not mistake  the water's his  And all that it affords  To fish or hunt they have no right  Since they no land c  n claim  Whatever lives  e't great or small  The land su  ports the same  So they must work to other men  Whether they will o  no  Fo  dle up and down the world  No  mile  men must go  For why in truth they cannot live  On air or the highway  Trespass they must then on the grass  If suffer'd thus to stray  And yet no laws are made that so  The rich them work may give  But when they've serv'd their turn on them  They care not how they live  So worse than horse or oxen thus  Is their unhappy lot  For horse and oxen they maintain  Whether they work or not  Their wages too by law they stint  As men their labour too  Should have no right as best they can  To sell to that  vile crew  But not so with their ill got lands  Do they themselves confine  As much as they can get's the rule  By which they let the same  Like tygers

happy state  Each parish deals so fair  That every housholder therein  Does get an EQUAL SHARE  Though the inhabitants in every country have an undonbtod  ight to divide the WHOLE of the rents equally among themselves and suffer the state and all public affairs to be supported by taxes as usual yet from the numerous evils and restraints attending revenue laws and the number of collectors informers c appendant on the same it is supposed they would rather prefer That after the whole amount of the rents are collected in a parish from every per∣son according to the full value of the premises which they occupy so much per pound according to act of parliament should be set apart for support of the state instead of all taxes that another sum should next be deducted for support of the parish

their own the government is either monarchy or aris∣tocracy where a people can live upon their own the government may be democracy  A man that could live upon his own may yet to spare his own and live upon another be a ser∣vant but a people that can live upon their own cannot spare their own and live upon another but except they be no servants that is except they come to a democracy they must waste their own by maintaining their masters or by having others to live upon them  Where a people that can live upon their own imagine that they can be governed by others and not lived upon by such governors it is not the genius of the people it is the mistake of the people  Where a people that can live upon their own will not be governed by others lest they be lived upon by others it is not the mistake of the peo∣ple it is the genius of the people  If a man has some estate he may have some ser∣vants or a family and consequently some govern∣ment or something to govern if he has no estate he can have no government  Where the eldest of many brothers has all or so much that the rest of their livelihood stand in need of him that brother is as it were prince in that family  Where of many brothers the eldest has but an equal share or not so inequal as to make the rest to stand in need of him for their livelihood that family is as it were a commonwealth  The parts of form in government are as the offices in a house and the orders of a form of go∣vernment are as the orders of a house or family  Good orders make evil men good and bad orders make good men evil  The interest of arbitrary monarchy is the abso∣luteness of the monarch the interest of regulated monarchy is the greatness of the nobility the in∣terest of democracy is the felicity of the people for in democracy the government is for the use of the people and in monarchy the people are for the use of the government that is of one lord or more  A sole legislator proceeding according to art or knowledge produces government in the whole piece at once and in perfection But a council proceeding not according to art or what in a new case is necessary or fit for them but according to that which they call the genius of the people still  hankering after the things they have been used to or their old customs how plain soever it may be made in reason that they can no longer fit them make patching work and are ages about that which is very seldom or never brought by them to any perfection but commonly comes by the way to ruin leaving the noblest attempt under reproach and the authors of them exposed to the greatest miseries while they live if not their me∣mories when they are dead and gone to the greatest infamy  A parliament of physicians would never have found out the circulation of the blood nor could a parliament of poets have written VLRGIL's  Aeneas  of this kind therefore in the formation of government is the proceeding of a sole legislator But if the people without a legislator set upon such a work by a certain instinct that is in them they never go further than to chuse a council not con∣sidering that the formation of government is as well a work of invention as of judgment and that a council though in matters laid before them they may excel in judgment yet invention is as contrary to the nature of a council as it is to musi∣cians in consort who can play and judge of any air that is laid before them though to invent a part of music they can never well agree  PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS MAY PLAN MO∣DELS OF GOVERNMENT  From Harrington's Oceana  ONE that has written considerations upon OCEANA speaks the prologue in this man∣ner I beseech you gentlemen are not we the writers of politics somewhat a ridiculous sort of people Is it not a fine piece of folly for private  men sitting in their cabinets to rack their braine about models of government Certainly our la∣bours make a very pleasant recreation for those great personages who sitting at the helm of af∣fairs have by their large experience not only ac∣quired the art of ruling but have attained also to the comprehension of the nature and foundation of government" In which egregious compliment the considerer has lost his considering cap  It was in the time of  Alexander  the greatest prince and commander of his age that  Aristotle  with scarce inferior applause and equal same being a private man wrote that excellent piece of prudence in his cabinet which is called his  poli∣tics  going upon far other principles than those of  Alexander's  government which it has long out∣lived The like did  Titus Livius  in the time of  Augustus Sir Thomas More  in the time of  Henry the Eighth  and  Machiavel  when Italy was under princes that afforded him not the ear These works nevertheless are all of the most esteemed and applauded in this kind nor have I found any  an whose like endeavours have been persecuted hace  Plato  by  Dionysius  I study not without great examples nor out of my calling either arms or this art being the proper trade of a gentleman A man may be entrusted with a ship and a good pilot too yet not understand how to make sea∣charts To say that a man may not write of go∣vernment except he be a magistrate is as absurd as to say that a man may not make a seachart unless he be a pilot It is known that  Christopher Columbus  made a chart in his cabinet that found out the  Indies  The magistrate that was good at his steer∣age never took it ill of him that brought him a chan seeing whether he would use it or no was at his own choice and if flatterers being the worst sort of crows did not pick out the eyes of the living the ship of government at this day  throughout christendom had not struck so often as she has done To treat of affairs says  Machiavel  which as to the conduct of them appertain to others may be thought a great boldness but if I commit errors in writing these may be known without danger whereas if they commit errors in acting such come not otherwise to be known than in the ruin of the commonwealth  THE CAUSES OF ENGLISH MISERY  From the Critic Philosopher  ENGLAND produces every article necessary for the support of mankind and might by proper cultivation extended produce treble the quantity The lower class of the people reap very little benefit from profusion because every device is made use of to enhance the value of the commo∣dities requisite for their subsistence Methinks one half of the inhabitants of this kingdom are dying of hunger and concomitant misery while the other half from wallowing in abundance are dying of indigestion The spirit of gaming has so diffused itself through every rank that the no∣bleman risks his thousands on the out of a card or the turn of a die the tradesman ventures his hun∣dreds on the rise and fall of stocks whilst the me∣chanic and servant lose their guineas on the draw∣ing of a lottery ticket Hence the pensioned peer the bankrupt tradesman and the crowded prisons  Our trading justices our pettifoggers and our affidavit men are the locusts which consume our property and destroy our peace We have been kingridden and priestridden but what is much worse than either we are at this enlightened age as is termed lawridden by a set of as honest fel∣lows  as ever graced civil society They serve us with nevertheless notwithstanding howbeit said and aforesaid those and that demised set and let plaintiff and appellant defendant and respondent and such other jargon by way of break fast next come by way of dinner a writ of error judg∣ment by default a nonprocess a latitat a habeas a bail bond a subpoena a cognovit and such other comfortable dishes and to conclude the day an elegant supper is prepared of verdicts nonsuits bills of costs the hallowed touch of a bumbailiff a  spunginghouse or prison and such is the boasted liberty of England the land of freedom  But to be more serious let me ask the first law∣yer in this kingdom whether he can truly say he perfectly understands our laws nay whether he has read them for I am sure it would require the space of a whole century added to an extraordinary memory and sound understanding to read and pro∣perly comprehend one half of the lawbooks which our peers commons c have caused to be ushered into the world If the laws are made for the good and observance of the subject why are they not brought within the compass of common under∣standing and given to him to guide his moral conduct For how can a man injustice be held amenable to laws fabricated by men with whom he has no intercourse and from whom he conse∣quently cannot receive any information And why ought he to be punished for the violation of a law with which he was never made previously acquainted 'Tis true there are certain plain rules laid down for man's conduct in his walks through life and these he may learn by reading his catechism we will there find that the deca∣logue comprises the duty we owe to God and our∣selves and I will venture to affirm that a few comments  if necessary  on each command would be quite sufficient for the regulation of the reci∣procal  duties we are bound to observe in our in∣tercourse with each other The study of law can∣not be deemed a science as it really should be no more than  equity founded on reason  and when it deviates from that it becomes  quibbling chicanery  All the laws necessary for the regulation of so∣ciety may be comprized in a volume of less size than the Critic Philosopher and this I intend clearly to prove at a future period But I suppose as we have too much  law  and very little  gospel  because the generality of us love that which is most like ourselves both clergy and lawyers will unite in reprobating any writer who may  diminish  the emoluments of the  one  or  invade  the province of the  other  IN WHAT CASES WAR IS JUSTIFIABLE C  From the Persian Letters  THE magistrate ought to do justice between citizen and citizen every nation ought to do the same between themselves and another na∣tion This second distribution of justice requires no maxim but what are used in the first  Between nation and nation there is seldom any want of a third to be umpire because the grounds of dispute are almost always clear and easy to be determined The interests of two nations are ge∣nerally so far separated that it requires nothing but to be a true lover of justice to find it out  It is not the same with regard to the differences that arise between private persons As they live in society their interests are so mingled and con∣founded and there are so many different sorts of them that it is necessary for a third person to un∣tangle what the covetousness of the parties strives to tie knots in  There are but two sorts of justifiable wars that which we enter into for the repelling an enemy that attacks us and that which we undertake in defence of an ally that is attacked  There would be no equity in making war upon a prince's private quarrel unless the case were of that heinous nature as to deserve the death of the prince or people that committed it Thus a prince should not make war for being denied some honour which was  r  ght or for any disrespect to his ambassa  or th  like trif  es no more than a private  ough  to kill one that refuses him the wal  the reason is that as a declaration of was i  an act of justice wherein the punishment  always bear proportion to the fault we  hould con  ider whether the person we declare war against is worthy of death For to make war upon any one is to seek to punish him with death  The most severe act of justice in the law of na∣tions is war its end being the destruction of society  Reprisals are of the second degree To pro∣portion the penalty to the crime is a method which no tribunal could ever help observing  A third act of justice is to deprive a prince of the advantages he reaps from our commerce still measuring the punishment by the offence  The fourth act of justice which ought to be the most frequent is a renunciation of the al∣liance of the people against whom we have cause of complaint This penalty is answerable to that of banishment in common tribunals which cuts off the criminal from society So a prince whose alliance we renounce is thereby cut off from our society and is no longer one of our members  There can be no greater affront done to a prince than to renounce his alliance and no greater honour than to court it There is nothing among  men more glorious nor more useful than to have others concerned as watchful for their preser∣vation  But in order to make an alliance binding it must be just so that an alliance made between two na∣tions to oppress a third is not lawful and may honourably and innocently be broke  Neither does it become the dignity and reputa∣tion of a prince to enter into an alliance with a tyrant  We read that a certain Egyptian monarch sent to reprehend the king of  Samos  for his cruelty and tyranny calling upon him to amend and upon his not doing it he gave him to know that he renounced his friendship and alliance  The right of conquest is no right at all A so∣ciety can never be founded upon any thing but the free consent of all the members if it is destroyed by conquest the people are thereby freed from their old engagements it does not make a new society and if the conqueror goes about to do it he acts the tyrant  As to treaties of peace they are never lawful when they ordain a cession or reparation more considerable than the damage done this is mere violence and may at any time be lawfully set aside unless in order to recover what we have lost we are obliged to have recourse to such vio∣lent methods as will create mischiefs greater than the advantage sought after  This my dear  Rhedi  is what I call the law of nations which may be called more properly the law of reason  ON PERVERSION OF TERMS  From the Independent Whig  IT is a shameful insult upon our understandings that of sanctifying the most wicked purposes  and most cruel actions with the most honest and innocent names and yet nothing is more fre∣quently practised Thus the worthy name of RULER shall be prostituted and pronounced aloud to palliate and even to justify the barbarities of a TYRANT and that peaceable word  obedience  shall be forced to signify an unmanly and unnatural pa∣tience of  servitude  LAWS which were intended to protect and encourage good men and to re∣strain and punish ill ones are often perverted into deadly instruments in the hands of robbers and usurpers against the virtuous and the harmless and the means of preservation are turned into en∣gines of destruction The  Lord's anointed  a phrase which at first signified only a man approved and chosen by God himself to be the ruler of his peo∣ple has been since wrested to mean an overgrown plunderer who  chose himself  to be a destroyer of God's people  EUROPEAN MONARCHIES DESCRIBED AS MONAR∣CHIES OUGHT TO BE  From the Persian Letters  MOST of the governments in  Europe  are mo∣narchic or rather called so for I know not whether there were ever any such in reality at least it is impossible they should subsist long it is a state of violence and always fall into a despo∣tical government or into a republic the power can never be equally divided between the prince and the people the equilibrium is too difficult to preserve the power must diminish on one side while it encreases on the other but the advantage generally happens on the side of the prince who is at the head of the armies  And accordingly the power of the  European  kings is very great and one may venture to say  as great as they please to make it but they do not stretch it so far as our sultans first because they would not shock the manners and religion of their subjects Secondly because it is not their interest to carry it so far  Nothing brings down a prince so near to the condition of his subjects as exercising an extra∣vagant power over them nothing exposes them so much to the turns and caprices of fortune  The custom they use of causing all that offend them to be put to death upon the least signal over∣throws the proportion which ought to be kept be∣tween the faults and the punishments which is in a manner the soul of a state and the harmony of an empire and this proportion being scrupulously observed by the christian princes gives them an infinite advantage above our sultans  A Persian who either by imprudence or misfor∣tune has drawn upon himself the displeasure of his prince is sure of death the least fault or the least caprice brings him into this case But if he had attempted the life of his sovereign if he had gone about to betray his strong towns to the ene∣my he could still but lose his life therefore he runs no greater risk in this last case than in the first  So that upon the least displeasure finding death unavoidable and having nothing worse to fear he is naturally inclined to disturb the peace of the state and to conspire against his sovereign this being the only refuge he has left  It is not so with the great men in Europe who lose nothing by being disgraced but the goodwill and favour of their prince they retire from court and think of nothing but enjoying a quiet life and the advantages of their birth As they seldom for∣feit their lives but for high treason they are fear∣ful of being drawn into it considering how much they have to lose and how little to gain which  is the reason that here we seldom see rebellions or kings destroyed by violent deaths  If in the unlimited authority our princes pos∣sess they did not use so many precautions to guard their lives they would none of them live a day and if they did not keep in pay an infinite number of troops to tyrannize over the rest of their sub∣jects their empire would not subsist a month  Description of a PARISIAN PARLIAMENT in the year such as Parliaments ought to be  From the Persian Letters  THE parliament of  Paris  is just now banished to a little town called  Pontoise  The council have sent to them to register or approve a decla∣ration which dishonours them and they have registered it in such a manner as dishonours the council  Some other parliaments of the kingdom are threatened with the like treatment  Parliaments are always odious they never ap∣proach kings but to tell them disagreeable truths and whilst a crowd of courtiers are continually representing to them a people happy under their government these come and contradict the flat∣tery and throw at the foot of the throne the groans and tears committed to their charge  ERSKINE's DEFENCE OF PAINE    Continued from page    vol I    SUCH were the words of that great good man lost with those of many others of his time and his fame as far as power could hurt it put in the shade along with them The consequences we  have all seen and felt America from an obedient affectionate colony became an independent na∣tion and two millions of people nursed in the very lap of our monarchy became the willing subjects of a republican constitution  Gentlemen in that great and calamitous con∣flict Mr Burke and Mr Paine fought in the same field of reason together but with very different successes Mr Burke spoke to a parliament in England such as Sir George Saville describes it that had no ears but for sounds that flattered its corruptions Mr Paine on the other hand spoke TO A PEOPLE reasoned with them that they were bound by no subjection to any sovereignty further than their own benefits connected them and by these powerful arguments prepared the minds of the American people for that GLORIOUS JUST and HAPPY revolution  Gentlemen I have a right to distinguish it by that appellation because I aver that at this mo∣ment there is as sacred a regard to property as inviolable a security to all the rights of individu∣als lower taxes fewer grievances less to de∣plore and more to admire in the constitution of America than that of any other country under heaven I wish indeed to except our own but I cannot even do that till it shall be purged of those abuses which though they obscure and deform the surface have not as yet  thank God  destroyed the vital parts  Why then is Mr Paine to be calumniated and reviled because out of a people consisting of near three millions he alone did not remain attached in opinion to a monarchy Remember that all the blood which was shed in America and to which he was for years a melancholy and indig∣nant witness was shed by the authority of the crown of Great Britain under the influence of its parliament such as Sir George Saville has  described it and such as Mr Burke himself will be called upon by and by in more glowing colours to paint it How then can it be wondered at that Mr Paine should return to this country in his heart a republican Was he not equally repub∣lican when he wrote common sense yet that vo∣lume has been sold without restraint or prosecu∣tion in every shop in England ever since and which nevertheless  I appeal to the book which I have in court and which is in every body's hands  contains every one principle of government and every abuse in the British constitution which is to be sound in the Rights of Man Yet Mr Burke himself saw no reason to be alarmed at its publica∣tion nor to cry down its contents even when America which was swayed by it was in arms against the crown of Great Britain You shall hear his opinion of it in his letter to the sheriffs of Bristol page and  The Court Gazettee accomplished what the abettors of independence had attempted in vain When that di  ingenuous compilation and strange medley of railing and flattery was adduced as a proof of the united sentiments of the people of Great Britain there was a great change throughout all America The tide of popular affection which had still set to wards the parent country began immediately to turn and to slow with great rapidity in a contrary course Far from concealing these wild declarations of enmity  the author of the celebrated pamphlet which prepared the minds of the people for independence  insists largely on the multitude and the spirit of these addresses and draws an argument from them which if the fact were as he supposes must be irresistible For I never knew a writer on the theory of government so partial to au∣thority as not to allow that the hostile mind of the rulers to their people did fully justify  a change of government nor can any reason whatever be given why one people should vo∣luntarily yield any degree of preeminence to another but on a supposition of great affection and benevolence towards them Unfortunately for rulers trusting to other things took no no∣tice of this great principle of connexion  But there is a time it seems for all things  Gentlemen the consequences of this mighty re∣volution are too notorious to require illustration No audience would sit to hear what every body has seen and felt the independence of America notoriously produced not by remote and circuitous effect but directly and palpably the revolutions that now agitate Europe and which portend such new changes over the face of the earth Let governors take warning The revolution in France was the consequence of her incurably corrupt and profligate government God forbid that I should be thought to lean by this declaration upon her unfortunate monarch bending perhaps at this moment under affliction which my heart sinks within me to think of but when I speak with detestation of the former politics of the French court I fasten as little of them upon that fallen and unhappy prince as I impute to our gracious sovereign the corruptions of our own government I desire indeed in the most disinterested manner to be understood that I mean to speak of his majesty not only with that obedience and duty which I owe to him as a subject but with that justice which I think is due to him from all men who examine his conduct either in public or private life  Gentlemen Mr Paine happened to be in Eng∣land when the French revolution took place and notwithstanding what he may be supposed and allowed from his history to have felt upon such a subject he continued wholly silent and inactive The people of this country too appeared to be in∣different  spectators of the animating scene They saw without visible emotion despotism destroyed and the king of France by his own consent be∣come the first magistrate of a free people Cer∣tainly at least it produced none of those effects which are so deprecated by government at pre∣sent nor most probably ever would if it had not occurred to the celebrated person whose name I must so often mention voluntarily to provoke the subject a subject which if dangerous to be discussed he should not have led to the discussion for surely it is not to be endured that any pri∣vate man is to publish a creed for a whole nation to tell us that we are not to think for ourselves to impose his own fetters upon the human mind to dogmatize at discretionand that no man shall sit down to answer him without being guilty of a libel I assert that if it be a libel to mistake our constitutionto support it by means that tend to destroy itand to choose the most dangerous season for the interference Mr Burke is that libeller but not therefore the object of a criminal prosecu∣tion for whilst I am defending the motives of one man I have neither right nor disposition to criminate the motives of another All I contend for is a fact that cannot be controverted viz that this officious interference was the origin of Mr Paine's book I put my cause upon its being the origin of itthe avowed originas will abundantly appear from the introduction and preface to both parts and throughout the whole body of the work nay from the very work of Mr Burke himself to which both of them are answers  Gentlemen for the history of that celebrated work I appeal to itself  When the French revolution had arrived at some of its early stages a few and but a few per∣sons not to be named when compared with the nation took a visible interest in these mighty  events and interest well becoming Englishmen They saw a pernicious system of government which had led to cruel desolating wars and had been for ages the scourge of Great Britain giving way to a system which seemed to promise harmony and peace amongst the nations They saw this with virtuous and peaceable satisfaction And a reve∣rend divine Dr Price eminent for his eloquence recollecting that the issues of life are in the hands of God saw no profaneness in mixing the subject with public thanksgiving reminding the people of this country of their own glorious deliverance in former ages It happened also that a society of gentlemen France being then a neutral nation and her own monarch  swearing almost daily upon her altars to maintain the new constitution  thought they infringed no law by sending a general congratula∣tion Their numbers indeed were very incon∣siderable so much so that Mr Burke with more truth than wisdom begins his volume with a sar∣casm upon their insignificance  Until very lately he had never heard of such a club It certainly never occupied a moment of his thoughts nor he believed those of any person out of their own set  Why then make these proceedings the subject of alarm throughout EnglandThere had been no prosecution against them nor any charge founded upon suspicion of disaffection against any of their body But Mr Burke thought it was reserved for his eloquence to whip these curs of faction to their kennel How he has succeeded I appeal to all that has happened since the introduction of his schism in the British empire by giving to the king whose title was questioned by no man a title which it is his majesty's most solemn interest to disclaim  After having in his first work lashed Dr Price in a strain of eloquent irony for considering the  monarchy to be elective which he could not but know Dr Price in the literal sense of election neither did or could possibly consider it Mr Burke published a second treatise in which after reprinting many passages from Mr Paine's former work he ridicules and denies the supposed right of the people to change their government in the following words  "The French revolution  say they  " speaking of the English societies  was the act of the ma∣jority of the people and if the majority of any other people  the people of England for instance  wish to make the same change they have the same right just the same undoubtedly that is none at all  And then after speaking of the subserviency of will to duty in which I agree with him he in a substantive sentence maintains the same doc∣trine thus  The constitution of a country being once set∣tled upon some compact tacit or expressed there is no power existing of force to alter it without the breach of the covenant or the consent of all the parties Such is the nature of a contract  So that if reason or even Revelation itself were now to demonstrate to us that our constitution was mischievous in its effects that to use Mr AttorneyGeneral's expression we had been in∣sanes for the many centuries we have supported it yet that still if the king had not forfeited his title to the crown nor the lords their privileges the universal voice of the whole people of England could not build up a new government upon a legi∣timate basis  Gentlemen not to argue for the present against such a proposition and supposing it could beyond all controversy be maintained for heaven's sake let wisdom never utter it If you seek the stability of the English government rather put the book  of Mr Paine which calls it bad into every hand in the kingdom than doctrines which bid human nature rebel even against that which is the best Say to the people of England look at your consti∣tution there it lies before youthe work of your pious fathers handed down as a sacred deposit from generation to generation the result of wis∣dom and virtue and its parts cemented together with kindred blood There are indeed a few spots upon its surface but the same principle which reared the structure will brush them all away you may keep it or you may destroy itTo such an address what would be the answer A chorus of the nation  Yes we will preserve it  But say to the same nation even of the very same constitution it is yours such as it is for better or for worse it is strapped upon your backs to carry it as beasts of burthen and you have no jurisdiction to cast it off Let this be your position and you instantly raise up I appeal to every man's consciousness of his own nature a spirit of uneasiness and discon∣tent Yet it is the controversy alone which this useless and mischievous proposition stirred up that has pointed most of the passages arraigned before you which it will be presently my duty to explain  But let the prudence of the argument be what it may the argument itself is untenable  To be continued  AN ELEGY WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD  BY GRAY  THE ARGUMENT

mutual correspondence of political societies foreign and domestic is no slight argument of their utility It amounts to proof that this means of communi∣cating knowledge to the public is likely to be at∣tended with beneficial effects to the best interests of mankind or it would not be an object of so much alarm to the pensioned advocates of aristo∣cracy The people now see the great importance of political enquiries and extensive influence of the maxims of government which operate directly or indirectly on every moment of our existence and every action of our lives They perceive much to learn and much to unlearn on the question of civil government they expect as their right a free access to all peaceable means of information and exclaim with reason  we will be kept in the trammels of implicit belief no longer  However plain and simple the true principles of government may be when divested of that garb of complication and mystery in which statecraft has enveloped them it is certain that they are not yet fully settled among those who profess to write and reason on the subject The best political writers of the present day among the English and French are not agreed on points of considerable moment and Mr Burke himself has taken no small pains to magnify the difficulties attending a branch of knowledge of which he dreads while he promotes the public discussion Difficulties there are such as ignorance and artifice have created but if they exist of whatever kind they may be why throw obstacles in the way of enquiry and deny the means of removing them At any rate Mr Burke whose time for two years past has been  chiefly occupied in publishing discourses of poli∣tical mysticisin ought to be the last to cry out against any source of information on a subject which he has laboured so indefatigably to obscure Equally aware that public ignorance is the in∣terests of courts and public information the in∣terest of the people the patriotic societies of France and England profess the same general principles of equal liberty and have precisely the same  general  object in view viz the improvement and propagation of political knowledge In France as is natural they discuss the temporary occurrences of their own country we those of ours but the same science and the same principles are equally applicable to both These societies in each kingdom entertaining therefore the same general design of extending the bounds of know∣ledge on the most important of all subjects of en∣quiry can it be deemed improper or unbecoming that they should mutually communicate for a com∣mon purpose Is there any impropriety in the  philosephical  societies of London Paris or Stock∣holm corresponding for the improvement of che∣mistry or experimental philosophy On the con∣trary do they not all court correspondencies as the most effectual means of diffusing information Why then should societies instituted for the pro∣motion of  political  knowledge be debarred from the common means of improvement If it be a crime to enlighten the people upon the subject of politics why do not our adversaries say so at once and take that ground of accusation if it be no crime why deny the common methods of com∣munication permitted and adopted in every other branch of human science  But after all why this anxiety among the go∣vernments of Europe our own among the rest to stop the progress of knowledge and cut off the sources of political information Why this dread  lest the people the  swinish multitude  as their friend Mr Burke calls them should think too much and reason too much on their own rights and their own interests lest the deep veil of mystery which statecraft has thrown over the science of government should perchance be with∣drawn and the transactions of courtpolities be exposed to public observation If the foundations of these gaudy superstructures be unsound this conduct is easily explained but if governments do actually mean well if their principles and actions will bear examination why this general dread of investigation Why give room to suspect that "Men love darkness rather than lightbe∣cause their deeds are evil"  An edifying Lesson for the poor SWINISH MUL∣TITUDE    From the Morning Post of January    I tell thee  Mufti  if the world were wise  They would not wag one finger in your quarrels  Your heaven you promise but our earth you covet  Ye  phaetons  of mankind who sire that world  Which you were sent by preaching but to warm  DRYDEN  The author of a pamphlet called "Peace and Reform" charges our divines with recom∣mending a conduct equally sanguinary with the French and infers there from that French prin∣ciples of liberty are no more to be condemned on account of the excesses committed by a part of that nation than the British constitution is to be condemned on account of the excesses recom∣mended from the pulpit The following is the passage we allude to  THE fastday instead of being passed in con∣formity with its professed purpose in hu∣miliation  before God in prayers for the conver∣sion of unbelievers the reformation of ourselves and the general peace and happiness of mankind instead of a day on which every priest made an ex∣traordinary exertion of his powers in imploring the benevolence of the Almighty to enlighten the minds to soften the hearts and to spare the blood of his people it was chiefly celebrated by the most dreadful maledictions The Supreme Being who true religion tells us enjoins brotherly love for∣giveness humanity and virtue was addressed by our Divines as if he had been more merciless and bloodthirsty than any divinity that ever disgraced Paganism and the temples of the God of Peace were made to resound with imprecations from which even our ancestors would have recoiled when engaged in the worship of their serocious Odin whom they revered as  the terrible and severe God the active roaring Deity the fa∣ther of slaughter the God that carrieth deso∣lation and fire and nameth those that are to be flain  See the Edda  The solemnity of the scene was well calculated for rousing and misleading the passions and every artifice was employed to excite hatred towards the French and provoke us to fury The priesthood as well as the princes felt themselves interested in the cause and their zeal shook the pulpit with exhortations to vengeance The bishop of Glou∣cester before the house of lords thus spoke of that nation  Infatuated and remorseless peo∣ple The measure of your iniquities seems a  length to be full the hour of retribution is coming fast upon you Drunk with the blood of your fellowcitizens you have dared to spread your ravages abroad rousing the surrounding nations in justice to themselves and the common  cause of humanity to confederate against you in order to execute the wrath of God on your de∣voted heads  His lordship however might have been restrained from such rash denunciations of divine judgment by the awful admonitions of the founder of that religion which he pretended to preach  And Jesus answering said suppose ye these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans because they suffered such things I tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish  And those eighteen on whom the Tower of Siloam fell and slew them think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jeru∣salem I tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish  St Luke xiii  The other Fast Day Sermons were in unison with that of the bishop of Gloucester with a very few exceptions The Rev J Gardener at Taun∣ton said  Shall we not labour to bring such per∣sons as the French and reformers in general to a proper sense of their duty  or exterminate them and their opinions  and the Rev Mr Bromley at Fitzroy Chapel hopes  that the reck∣oning which God will make will not be long de∣layed against a nation France which is cer∣tainly behind no other whose measure of iniqui∣ties has in any records of time  called forth his ven∣geance to erase it from the earth  These passages are taken from the sermons published under the names of those divines  These are the sentiments of our HIGH church pastors such is the religion the benevolence the humanity they teach To exterminate for opinion What more did Marat ever desire To be the instrument of God in executing his vengeance Mahomet used  the same plea for all his murders and rapine To erase a whole nation from the earth Neither Mahomet Marat nor Roberspierre have equalled this How limited and insignificant have been their proscriptions compared with those of our own pious pastors who would  seal on the forehead as the servants of God  Vide Revelations c vii v  all those who make war against France who would  send myriads of locusts with crowns like gold upon their heads and faces like men invested with scor∣pion power to torment the unsealed  enthu∣siasts of that distracted nation and  let loose the angels of the Euphrates to slaughter a third part of mankind  Vide Revelations c ix  Similar passages from the sermons preached on that christian day would fill a volume Most of them tend to inflame the people to a war of exter∣mination and insinuate the destruction of those who desire a parliamentary reform Surely our di∣vines cannot be so much mistaken as to imagine these harangues gratifying to the head of the church Their affection towards the crown in∣deed is natural The bishop of Durham's promo∣tion has taught them the road to preferment and my lord of Gloucester has been long looking for a translation but not such as Elijah's His present ambition looks no higher than Canterbury  Nor were the sermons publicly preached more inflammatory than the writings anonymously pub∣lished by our high church men one of which in Birmingham under the fictitious name of Job Nott thus speaks of those whom it calls  Newfashioned restless dissenters  and the members of a society instituted on the principles of Mr Pitt and the duke of Richmond for procuring a reform of parliament  Do be off only think of the New Drop you may be recorded in the Newgate  Calender transportation may reform you you deserve to be highly exalted did you ever see the New Drop  and concludes with wish∣ing that these dissenters and reformers whom it deems factious "tied in their garters may swing" Yet the author of this elegant book calls himself a friend to conciliation and unanimity a moderate man a man of peace He may be so for a Birming∣ham man but if such are the friends to peace and moderation in that town can we wonder at the atrocities which have taken place there and still may be repeated while Job Nott and such publi∣cations are publicly sold with a bookseller's name to them and are even boasted of by their authors  ON THE COMMON PEOPLE  From Rosseau's Emilius  IT is the populace which compose the bulk of mankind those which are not in this class are so few in number that they are hardly worth no∣tice Man is the same creature in every state therefore that which is the most numerous ought to be most respected To a man capable of reflec∣tion all civil distinctions are nothing he observes the same passions the same feelings in the clown and the man of quality the principal differ∣ence between them consists in the language they speak in a little refinement of expression but if there be any real distinction it is certainly to the disadvantage of the least sincere The common people appear as they really are and they are not amiable if those in highlife were equally undis∣guised their appearance would make us shudder with horror  There is say our philosophers an equal allot∣ment of happiness and misery to every rank of men a maxim as dangerous as it is absurd If all man∣kind  are equally happy it would be ridiculous to give ourselves any trouble to promote their felici∣ty Let each remain in his situation let the slave endure the lash the lame his infirmity and let the beggar perish since they would gain nothing by a change of situation The same philosophers enu∣merate the pangs of the rich and expatiate on the v  mity of their pleasures was there ever so palpa∣ble a sophism the pangs of a rich man are not es∣sential to riches but to the abuse of them If he were even more wretched than the poor he would deserve no compassion because he is the creator of his own misery and happiness was in his power But the sufferings of the indigent are the natural consequences of his state he feels the weight of his hard lot no length of time no habit can ever render him insensible of fatigue and hunger nei∣ther wisdom nor good humour can annihilate the evils which are inseparable from his situationWhat avails it an Epictetus to forsee that his mas∣ter is going to break his leg Doth that prevent the evil on the contrary his fore knowledge adds greatly to his misfortune If the populace were really as wise as we suppose them stupid how could they act otherwise than they do Study thi  order of men and you will find that in another language they will utter as much wit and more good sense than yourself Learn therefore to respect your species Remember that the common people compose the most considerable part of mankind and that if all the kings and philosophers were to be taken away the chasm would be imperceptible and things would go on just as well without them  ON KINGS  From Godwin's Enquiry concerning Political Justice    Continued from page    Vol    IF kings were exhibited simply as they are in themselves to the inspection of mankind the salutary prejudice as it has been called which teaches us to venerate them would speedily be ex∣tinct it has therefore been found necessary to sur∣round them with luxury and expence Thus are luxury and expence made the standard of honour and of consequence the topics of anxiety and envy However fatal this sentiment may be to the mo∣rality and happiness of mankind it is one of those illusions which monarchical government is eager to cherish In reality the first principle of virtu∣ous feeling as has been elsewhere said is the love of independence He that would be just must before all things estimate the objects about him at their true value But the principle in regal states has been to think your father the wisest of men because he is your father and your king the foremost of his species because he is a king The standard of in∣tellectual merit is no longer the man but his title To be drawn in a coach of state by eight milkwhite horses is the highest of all human claims to our ve∣neration The same principle inevitably runs through every order of the state and men desire wealth under a monarchical government for the same reason that under other circumstances they would have desired virtue  Let us suppose an individual who by severe la∣bour earns a scanty subsistence to become by ac∣cident or curiosity a spectator of the pomp of a royal progress Is it possible that he should not mentally apostrophise this elevated mortal and ask "What  has made thee to differ from me" If no such sen∣timent pass through his mind it is a proof that the corrupt institutions of society have already divest∣ed him of all sense of justice The more simple and direct is his character the more certainly will these sentiments occur What answer shall we re∣turn to his enquiry That the well being of socie∣ty requires men to be treated otherwise than accord∣ing to their intrinsic merit Whether he be satis∣fied with this answer or no will he not aspire to possess that which in this instance is wealth to which the policy of mankind has annexed such high distinction Is it not indispensible that before he believes in the rectitude of this institution his original feelings of right and wrong should be whol∣ly reversed If it be indispensible then let the ad∣vocate of the monarchical system ingenously declare that according to that system the interest of so∣ciety in the first instance requires the total subver∣sion of moral truth and justice  With this view let us again recollect the maxim adopted in monarchical countries "that the king never dies" Thus with true oriental extravagance we salute this imbecil mortal "O king live for ever" Why do we this Because upon his exist∣ence the existence of the state depends In his name the courts of law are opened If his political capacity be suspended for a moment the centre to which all public business is linked is destroyed In such countries every thing is uniform the ce∣remony is all and the substance nothing In the riots in the year the mace of the house of lords was proposed to be sent into the passages by the terror of its appearance to quiet the confusion but it was observed that if the mace should be  doly detained by the rioters the whole would be thrown into anarchy Business would be at a stand their insignia and with their insignia their legisla∣tive and deliberative functions be gone Who can  expect firmness and energy in a country where every thing is made to depend not upon justice public interest and reason but upon a piece of gilded wood What conscious dignity and virtue can there be among a people who if deprived of the imaginary guidance of one vulgar mortal are taught to believe that their faculties are benumbed and all their joints unstrung  The evils that arise out of avarice an inordinate admiration of wealth and an intemperate pursuit of it are so obvious that they have constituted a perpetual topic of lamentation and complaint The object in this place is to consider how far they are extended and aggravated by a monarchical govern∣ment that is by a constitution the very essence of which is to accumulate enormous wealth upon a single head and to render the ostentation of splen∣dor the chosen instrument for securing honour and veneration The object is to consider in what de∣gree the luxury of courts the effeminate softness of favourites the system never to be separated from the monarchical form of putting men's ap∣probation and good word at a price of individuals buying the favour of government and government buying the favour of individuals is injurious to the moral improvement of mankind As long as the unvarying practice of courts is cabal and as long as the unvarying tendency of cabal is to bear down talents and discourage virtue to recommend cunning in the room of sincerity a servile and supple disposition in preference to firmness and in∣flexibility a convenient morality as better than a strict one and the study of the red book of pro∣motion rather than the study of general welfare so long will monarchy be the bitterest and most po∣tent of all the adversaries of the true interests of mankind  To be continued  COMMONWEALTHS capable of raising the greatest Armies in Proportion to Territory  From Harrington's Oceana  WHERE the arms in bulk are proper and consisting of citizens they have other trades and therefore are no soldiers of fortune and yet because the commonwealth has arms for her trades in regard she is  a magistrate given for the good of mankind and bears not her sword in vain  they are all educated as well in military as civil disci∣pline taking their turns in service of either na∣ture according to the occasion and the orders of the commonwealth as in  Israel Athens Lacedemon  and  Rome  which had if their territories permit∣ted and sometimes as I may say whether their ter∣ritories permitted or no as in  Israel  the vastest the highest tempered and the best disciplined mi∣litia that is to be found in the whole compass of story Some armies of  Israel  have consisted of three or four hundred thousand men  Rome  upon the ru∣mour of a  Gallic  tumult armed in  Italy  only with∣out foreign aid seventy thousand horse and seven hundred thousand foot things in our days when the Turk can hardly arm half so many not to be credited  Hence that a commonwealth which had not first broken herself or been broken by some other com∣monwealth should not be found to have been conquered by the arms of any monarch is not miraculous but a natural effect of an apparent cause  PALEMON OR THE PRESSGANG  'FULL many an hour with tardy flight  Has wa  dered o'er my head  And many a day hath set in night  And many a month has fled  'Since Britain's lov'd lamented land  Evanish'd from my view  Since last I prest my Chloe's hand  And bade the soft adieu  'But now upon my raptur'd eye  Extends the long lost isle  And Chloe's lovely form is nigh  With fond affection's smile  'Ah me what woes were mine to prove  When far from genial skies  When absent from the voice of love  I saw the tempest rise  'Yet then amid the awful shade  That veil'd the gloomy sky  What time the dreadful whirl wind play'd  My Chloe's form was nigh  ''Twas thine in that tremendous hour  To soothe my fears to rest  'Twas thine the voice of hope to pour  Upon my weary breast  'What time the lightning's lurid blaze  Illum'd

 And bade her visions throng  I heav'd my passion to the wind  In many a pensive song  'Oft then thy tender form was seen  In fancy's anxious sight  To smile upon the wave serene  And chase the gloom of night  'Thy accents seem'd my ear to meet  And gently die away  In notes with melody replete  And soft as Cynthia's ray  'Thus have I past the lingering hours  While absent from thy smile  While absent from Britannia's bow'rs  Upon the deeps to toil  'But now upon my raptur'd sight  Britannia's hills are seen  And gentle Chloe with delight  Inspires the future scene'  Thus pour'd Palemon his soft strain  As near the rock they steer'd  Nor ever dreamt of future pain  Nor future sorrow fear'd  When sudden to the wand'ring eye  Along the heaving main  The cutter spread her sails on high  And march'd the wat'ry plain  They saw the savage gang appear  And trembled at the view  The pensive scene of grief was near  And pleasure bade adieu  Confin'd within the tender drear  He mourn'd the hours along  And pour'd of frantic woe the tear  The weeping waves among  No more he dreams of scenes of joy  Of prospects now decay'd  The pleasures that of late were nigh  In stern affliction fade  'Adieu' he said 'to Chloe's smile  For Chloe's smile no more  Shall tedious hours or days beguile  On Britain's long lost shore  'And can you thus ye sons of wrong  The innocent betray  But ah my griefs will not be long  For life declines away  'Ah must the gentle peaceful soul  Be torn from tranquil plains  To where the warring thunders roll  Where desolation reigns  'Let those who love the scenes of death  In scenes of battle fall  Nor bear away the peaceful breath  That wishes well to all'  He saidand o'er his youthful form  A sickly paleness play'd  And deaththat hover'd in the storm  Now spreads his gloomy shade  'Adieu ye scenes' he mournful cry'd  Where once unknown to care  With gentle Chloe at my side  I pass  d the moments fair  'And thou for whom I live and breathe  Adieu my Chloe dear  Oh twine for me the willow wreathe  And shed for me the tear  'Oft wander to my grave alone  When Cynthia spreads her ray  And breathe the tender pensive moan  And sigh the hours away

BISHOP PORTEUS  And let all the people say AMEN  ON WAR  From Voltaire's Philosophical Dictionary  FAMINE the plague and war are the three most famous ingredients in this lower world Under famine may be classed all the noxious foods which want obliges us to have recourse to thus shortening our life whilst we hope to support it  In the plague are included all contagious distem∣pers and these are not less than two or three thou∣sand These two gifts we hold from providence but war in which all those gifts are concentered we owe to the fancy of three or four hundred per∣sons scattered over the surface of the globe under the name of princes and ministers and on this ac∣count it may be that in several dedications they are called the living images of the Deity  The most hardened flatterer will allow that war is ever attended with plague and famine especially if he has seen the military hospitals in Germany or passed through any villages where some notable feat of arms has been performed  It is unquestionably a very noble art to ravage countries destroy dwellings and  communibus annis  out of a hundred thousand men to cut off forty thousand This invention was originally cultivated by nations assembled for their common good for instance the diet of the Greeks sent word to the diet of Phrygia and its neigbours that they were putting to sea in a thousand fishingboats in order to do their best to cut them off root and branch  The Roman people in a general assembly re∣solved that it was their interest to go and fight the Vejentes or the Volscians before harvest and some years after all the Romans being angry with all the Carthaginians fought a long time both by sea and land It is otherwise in our time  A genealogist sets forth to a prince that he is descended in a direct line from a count whose kindred three or four hundred years ago had made a family compact with a house the very me∣mory of which is extinguished That house had some distant claim to a province the last proprietor of which died of an apoplexy The prince and his council instantly resolve that this province belongs to him by divine right The province which is some hundred leagues from him protests that it does not so much as know him that it is not disposed to be governed by him that before prescribing laws to them their consent at least was necessary these allegations do not so much as reach the prince's ears it is insisted on that his right is incontestable He instantly picks up a multitude of men who have nothing to do nor nothing to lose cloaths them with coarse blue cloth one sou to the ell puts them on hats bound with coarse white worsted makes them turn to the right and left and thus marches away with them to glory  Other princes on this armament take part in it to the best of their ability and soon cover a small extent of country with more hireling murderers than GengisKan Tamerlane and Bajazet had at their heels  People at no small distance on hearing that fighting is going forward and that if they would make one there are five or fix sous a day for them immediately divide into two bands like reapers and go and sell their services to the first bidder  These multitudes furiously butcher one another not only without having any concern in the quar∣r  l but without so much as knowing what it is about  Sometimes five or fix powers are engaged three against three two against four sometimes even one  against five all equally detesting one another and friends and foes by turns agreeing only in one thing to do all the mischief possible  An odd circumstance in this infernal enterprize is that every chief of these ruffians has his colours consecrated and solemnly prays to God before he goes to destroy his neighbour If the slain in a battle do not exceed two or three thousand the for∣tunate commander does not think it worth thank∣ing God for but if besides killing ten or twelve thousand men he has been so far favoured by hea∣ven as totally to destroy some remarkable place then a verbose hymn is sung in four parts com∣posed in a language unknown to all the combatants and besides stuffed with barbarisms  Te Deum  The same song does for marriages and births as for massa∣cres which is scarce pardonable especially in a nation of all others the most noted for new songs  All countries pay a certain number of orators to celebrate these sanguinary actions some in a long black coat and over it a short docked cloak others in a gown with a kind of shirt over it some again over their shirts have two pieces of a mot∣leycoloured stuff hanging down They are all very longwinded in their harangues and to il∣lustrate a battle fought in Weteravia bring up what passed thousands of years ago in Palestine  At other times these gentry declaim against vice they prove by syllogisms and antitheses that ladies for slightly heightening the hue of their cheeks with a little carmine will assuredly be the eternal ob∣jects of eternal vengeance that Polyeucte and Athalia  Two French tragedies  are the devil's works that he whose table on a day of abstinence is loaded with fish to the amount of two hundred crowns is infalli∣bly saved and that a poor man for eating two  pennyworth of mutton goes to the devil for ever and ever  Among five or six thousand such declamations there may be and that is the most three or four written by a Gaul named Massillon which a gen∣tleman may bear to read but in not one of all those discourses has the orator the spirit to animad∣vert on war that scourge and crime which in∣cludes all others These groveling speakers are continually prating against love mankind's only solace and the only way of repairing it not a word do they say of the detestable endeavours of the mighty for its destruction  Bourdaloue  A celebrated preacher  a very bad sermon have you made against impurity but not one either bad or good on those various kinds of murders on those rob∣beries on those violences that universally rage by which the world is laid waste Put together all the vices of all ages and places and never will they come up to the mischiefs and enormities of only one campaign  Ye bungling soulphysicians to bellow for an hour and more against a few fleabites and not say a word about that horrid distemper which tears us to pieces Burn your books ye mora∣lizing philosophers Whilst the humour of a few shall make it an act of loyalty to butcher thousands of our fellowcreatures the part of mankind deci∣cated to heroism will be the most execrable and destructive monsters in all nature Of what avail is humanity benevolence modesty temperance mildness discretion and piety when half a pound of lead discharged at the distance of six hundred paces shatters my body when I expire at the age of twenty under pains unspeakable and amidst thousands in the same miserable condition when my eyes at their last opening see my native town  all in a blaze and the last sounds I hear are the shrieks and groans of women and children expiring among the ruins and all for the pretended interest of a man who is a stranger to us  THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS  A SONGTune  "Rule Britannia"  WHEN Britain first at heaven's command  Arose from out the asure main  This was the charter of the land  And guardian angels sung this strain  Ye Britons hark if bless'd you'd be  See that your guardian press be free  Though tyrants oft the scepter sway'd  In Britain's Isle a people free  In spite of placemen still assay'd  To keep their thoughts and printing free  Then Britons join'd their press to free  Their press secur'd their liberty  Its dating voice ravish'd each ear  To distant lands its fame was known  Reason and truth advancing near  Soon hurl'd a tyrant  James II  from his throne  Then Britons join'd their press to free  Their press secur'd their liberty  Though Burke and Reeves each sinew strain  Their base false doctrines to support  'Gainst falsehood we'll truth's cause maintain  Vict'ry awaits the grand effort  Then zealous be your press to free  And you'll secure your liberty  Let's then unite with heart and hand  Falshood already shrinks with fear  With truth attack the hireling band  When reason shines they'll disappear  Then Britons join your press to free  And you'll preserve your liberty  ERSKINE'S Defence of PAINE and of the LIBERTY of the PRESS    Continued from page    vol II    HIS majesty undoubtedly was not elected to the throne No man can be supposed in the teeth of fact to have contended it but did not the people of England elect King William and break the hereditary succession and does not his majesty's title grow out of that election It is one of the charges against the defendant his having denied the parliament which called the Prince of Orange to the throne to have been a legal conven∣tion of the whole people and is not the very foundation of that charge that it was such a legal convention and that it was intended to be so and if it was so did not the people then confer the crown upon King William without any regard to hereditary right Did they not cut off the Prince of Wales who stood directly in the line of suc∣cession and who had incurred no personal for∣feiture Did they not give their deliverer an estate in the crown totally new and unprecedented in the law or history of the country And lastly might they not by the same authority have given the royal inheritance to the family of a stranger Mr Justice Blackstone in his Commentaries in terms asserts that they might and ascribes their choice of King William and the subsequent limi∣tations of the crown not to the want of jurisdic∣tion but to their true origin to prudence and  discretion in not disturbing a valuable institution further than public safety and necessity dictated  The English government stands thenon this pub∣lic consent the true root of all governments And I agree with Mr Burke that while it is well ad∣ministered it is not in the power of factions or libels to disturb it though when ministers are in fault they are sure to set down all disturbances to these causes This is most justly and eloquently exemplified in the thoughts on the cause of the present discontents page and  Ministers contend that no adequate provoca∣tion has been given for so spreading a discon∣tent our affairs having been conducted through∣out with remarkable temper and consummate wisdom The wicked industry of some libel∣lers joined to the intrigues of a sew disappointed politicians have in their opinion been able to produce this unnatural ferment in the nation  Nothing indeed can be more unnatural than the present convulsions of this country if the above account be a true one I confess I shall assent to it with great reluctance and only on the compulsion of the clearest and firmest proofs because their account resolves itself into this short but discouraging proposition 'That we have a very good ministry but that we are a very bad people' that we set ourselves to bite the hand that feed us and with a malignant insanity oppose the measures and ungratefully vilify the persons of those whose sole object is our own peace and prosperity If a few puny libellers acting under a knot of factious politicians with∣out virtue parts or character for such they are constantly represented by these gentlemen are sufficient to excite this disturbance very per∣verse must be the disposition of that people amongst whom such a disturbance can be excited by such means  He says true never were serious disturbances excited by such means  But to return to the argumentLet us now see how the rights of the people stand upon authority and whether this great source of government is not maintained by persons on whom my friend will find it hard to fasten the character of libellers  I shall begin with the most modern author on the subject of governmenta gentleman whose work lies spread out before me as it often does for my delight and instruction in my leisure hours I have also by the favour of a friend who sits near me in court the honour of his personal acquaintance He is a man perhaps more than any other devoted to the real constitution of the country as will be found throughout his valuable work and he is a person besides of great learning which enable  him to infuse much useful knowledge into my learned friend who introduced me to him Mr Law king's counsel I speak of Mr Paley arch∣deacon of Carlisle and of his work entitled The Principles of Political and Moral Philosophy in which he investigates the first principles of all go∣vernments a discussion not thought dangerous till lately and I hope we shall soon get rid of this ridiculous panic  Mr Paley professes to think of government what the christian religion was thought of by its first teachers 'If it be of God it will stand' and he puts the duties of obedience to them upon free will and moral duty After dissenting from Mr Locke as to the origin of governments in compact he says  Wherefore rejecting the intervention of a compact as unfounded in its principle and dan∣gerous in the application we assign for the only ground of the subjects obligation THE WILL OF GOD AS COLLECTED FROM EXPEDIENCY  The steps by which the argument proceeds are few and direct 'It is the will of God that the happiness of human life be promoted' this is the first step and the foundation not only of this but of every moral conclusion 'Civil society conduces to that end' this is the second proposition 'civil societies cannot be upheld unless in each the interest of the whole society be binding upon every part and member of it' this is the third step and conducts us to the conclusion namely 'That so long as the inte∣rest of the whole society requires it that is so long as the established government cannot be re∣sisted or changed without public inconveniency it is the will of God which will universally determines our duty that the established govern∣ment be obeyed'  and no longer  But who shall judge of this We answer  Every man for himself'  In contentions between the sovereign and the subject the parties ac∣knowledge no common arbitrator and it would be absurd to commit the decision to those whose conduct has provoked the question and whose own interest authority and fate are immedi∣ately concerned in it The danger of error and ahuse is no objection to the rule of expediency because every other rule is liable to the same or greater and every rule that can be propounded upon the subject like all rules which appeal to or bind the conscience must in the application depend upon private judgment It may be ob∣served however that it ought equally to be ac∣counted the exercise of a man's private judg∣ment whether he determines by reasonings and conclusions of his own or submits to be di∣rected by the advice of others provided he be free to choose his guide  He then proceeds in a manner rather inconsistent  with the principles entertained by my learned friend in his opening to you  No usage law or authority whatever is so binding that it need or ought to be continued when it may be changed with advantage to the community The family of the princethe or∣der of successionthe prerogative of the crown the form and parts of the legislaturetogether with the respective powers office duration and mutual dependency of the several parts are all only so many laws mutable like other laws whenever expediency requires either by the ordinary act of the legislature or if the occa∣sion deserve it BY THE INTERPOSITION OF THE PEOPLE  No man can say that Mr Paley intended to dif∣fuse discontent by this declaration He must there∣fore be taken to think with me that freedom and affection and the sense of advantages are the best and the only supports of government On the same principle he then goes on to say  These points are wont to be approached with a kind of awe they are represented to the mind as prin∣ciples of the constitution settled by our an∣cestors and being settled to be no more com∣mitted to innovation or debate as foundations never to be stirred as the terms and conditions of the social compact to which every citizen of the state has engaged his fidelity by virtue of a promise which he cannot now recall Such rea∣sons have no place in our system  Such are the sentiments of this excellent author and there is no part of Mr Paine's work from the one end of it to the other that advances any other proposition  But the attorneygeneral will say these are the grave speculative opinions of a friend to the Eng∣lish government whereas Mr Paine is its professed enemy what then the principle is that every  man while he obeys the laws is to think for him∣self and to conduct himself as he thinks The very ends of society exact this licence and the po∣licy of the law in its provisions for its security has tacitly sanctioned it The real fact is that writings against a free and wellproportioned go∣vernment need not be guarded against by laws They cannot often exist and never with effect The just and awful principles of society are rarely brought forward but when they are insulted or denied or abused in practice Mr Locke's Essay on Government we owe to Sir Robert Filmer as we owe Mr Paine's to Mr Burke and indeed between the arguments of Filmer and Burke I see no essential difference since it is not worth dis∣puting whether a king exists by  divine  right or indissoluble  human  compact if he exists whether we will or no if his existence be without our consent and to continue without our benefit it matters not a farthing whether his title be from God or from man  To be continued  A MELANCHOLY LESSON FOR ENGLISHMEN  A Letter from the Author of L'Esprit des Loix to M Le Chevalier de Bruant  From Voltaire's Letters  I WAS not at *** when your letter came you embarrass me greatly I shall only answer you for the pleasure of entertaining myself with a man who is much better able to resolve the doubts which he proposed than the person to whom he sent them  I am not of your opinion with regard to despo∣tism and despotic princes It appears to me horri∣ble and absurd to the last degree that a whole peo∣ple  should blindly subject themselves to the caprice of one even if he were an angel For my own part I would not live under him a single day This angel may become in a moment a monster thirsting after blood Despotism is to me the most abominable and disgustful of all bad governments man is perpetually crushed debased and degraded by it Look into history ancient and modern if ever there was one upon earth that was not an in∣sult on mankind and the disgrace of human na∣ture Monarchy would doubtless be the best of governments if it was possible to find such kings as Henry IV the only one who ever deserved the homage and veneration of his subjects Kings should always be brought up in the school of afflic∣tion as this great man was such alone are truly great and the lovers of mankind Before we can feel for the misfortunes of others we must our∣selves have been unfortunate But on the other hand the hearts of princes corrupted by prospe∣rity and the slaves of pride and folly are inac∣cessible to pity and insensible to true glory  I am not at all surprized that in monarchies and especially in our own there should be so few princes worthy of esteem Incircled by corrupters knaves and hypocrites they accustom themselves to look upon their fellowcreatures with disdain and set no value on any but the sycophants who caress their vices and live in perpetual idleness and inactivity Such is generally the condition of a monarch great men are always scarce and great kings still more so Add to this that the splendor of a monarchy is short and transitory France is al∣ready sunk into misery and disgrace an age more will annihilate her or she will fall a prey to the first intrepid conqueror  The English government has nothing to support it but a delusive outside extremely flattering to the people who fancy themselves the sole go∣vernors  I do not know any country where it is more easy to create such open dissentions as may overthrow the state A man of sense and gene∣rosity may in ten years time erect himself into a despotic prince with more safety at London than at Moscow Remember Crom well Money alone is sufficient to corrupt the whole parliament  The great ever fond of riches and power and prostrate at the feet of fortune who always attend the throne will promote the views of their master and the great once gained over this phantom of liberty which appears at intervals in the convul∣sive motions of the commons which awakens sha  es itself and soon vanishes will be totally an∣nihilated at the first signal given by the Supreme Ruler  I know indeed of no monarchy that is fixed constant and perfect the wisest kings oppress their subjects to arrive at despotism Adieu my friend live in freedom and obscurity Solitude will procure you the best and truest pleasure selfcontent The foolish and the wicked seen far off will only excite your compassion to look nearly upon them would raise your contempt and indig∣nation  I write this in haste we will treat this matter more fully in the free intercourse of guiltless friendship  ANOTHER LESSON NOT MORE AGREEABLE  The Speech of LelopAw  Walpole  the Minister of the deceased Emperor Regoge  George I  to to his Successor  From Swift's Account of Japan  SIR hear not those who would most falsely impiously and maliciously insinuate that  your government can be carried on without that wholesome necessary expedient of  sharing the pub∣lic revenue  with your  faithful deserving senators  This I know my enemies are pleased to call  bribery  and  corruption  Be it so but I insist that without this bribery and corruption the wheels of govern∣ment will not turn or at least will be apt to take s  e  punc like other wheels unless they be greased at proper times If an angel from heaven should descend to govern  this  empire upon any other scheme than what our enemies call corruption he m  st return from whence he came and leave the work undone  Sir it is well known we are a trading nation and consequently cannot thrive in a bargain where nothing is to be gained The poor electors who run from their shops or the plough for the ser∣vice of their country are they not to be considered for their labour and their loyalty The candidates who with the hazard of their persons the loss of their characters and the ruin of their fortunes are preferred to the senate in a country where they are strangers before the very lords of the soil are they not to be rewarded for their zeal to your ma∣jesty's service and qualified to live in your metro∣polis as becomes the lustre of their stations  Sir if I have given great numbers of the most profitable employments among my own relations and nearest allies it was not out of any partiality but because I know them best and can best depend upon them I have been at the pains to mould and cultivate their opinions Abler heads might pro∣bably have been found but they would not be equally under my direction A huntsman who hath the absolute command of his dogs will hunt more effectually than with a better pack to whose manner and cry he is a stranger  Sir upon the whole I will appeal to all those who best knew your royal father whether that  blessed monarch had ever one axious thought for the public or disappointment or uneasiness or want of money for all his occasions during the time of my administration And how happy the people confessed themselves to be under such a king I leave to their own numerous addresses which all politicians will allow to be the most infallible proof how any nation stands affected to their sovereign  This will be the Manner of the King that shall reign over you  Sam  Observations on the Fatherly Conduct of PHARAOH to his People in their unparalleled Distress and the exemplary faithfulness of JOSEPH to the in∣terest of his King and Master  GEN ver Let Pharaoh  says Joseph  look out a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of Egypt  Let Pharaoh do this and let him appoint officers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years  And let them gather all the food of those good years that come  which Joseph no doubt ad∣vised Pharaoh to pay for  and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh and let them keep food in the cities  And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of Egypt that the land perish not through the famine  And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants  Whatever it might be for his servants it was a lucky famine for Pharaoh as we shall presently see  And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls  And he  Joseph  gathered up all the food o  the seven years which were in the land of Egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food of the field which was round about every city laid he up in the same  And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea very much until he left numbering for it was without number  This was all very good sup∣posing that the people were paid for their corn  And the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of Egypt were ended  And the seven years of dearth began to come according as Joseph had said and the dearth was in all lands but in all the land of Egypt there was bread  And when all the land of Egypt was fa∣m  shed the people cried to Pharaoh for bread and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians Go unto Joseph what he faith to you do  And the famine was over all the face of the earth and Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold unto the Egyptians  this he had an un∣questionable right to do at a reasonable rate if he bought it  and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt  And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn because that the famine was sore in all lands  The profits of so productive a foreign trade as this might have amply satisfied the avarice of Pharaoh and Joseph without entirely ruining and en∣sta  ng the unfortunate Egyptians but kings and mi∣nisters set no bounds to their rapine they will take both fl  ece and carcase if the silly sheep their subjects will salm    Chap ver And Joseph nourished his father and his brethren and all his father's houshold with bread according to their families  This was well it was only charity beginning at home as it ought What minister would not do so  And there was no bread in all the land  ex∣cept in Pharaoh's granaries  for the famine was very sore so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine  God help them their succour was now in cruel hands  And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt  for the good of his master like a good minister  and in the land of Ca∣naan  for the good of his country like a good politi∣cian  for the corn which they bought and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house  like a faithful servant  And when money failed in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan all the Egyp∣tians came unto Joseph and said Give us bread for why should we die in thy presence for the money faileth  Poor goodnatured people what a sin it was to use you so cruelly All the money that they had received from Pharaoh for the corn in the years of plenty if we can suppose such tyrants would give any to so tame a people was now extorted again from them together with all that they had beside  And Joseph said Give your cattle and I will give you for your cattle if money fail  Detestable extortioning wretch Sure this was taking more than a reasonable profit  And they brought their cattle unto Joseph and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses and for the flocks and for the cattle of the herds and for the asses and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year  Poor oppressed people your miseries and your patience have been overlooked for ages The slight afflictions of the favourits family of Israel have attracted and engrossed all the sympathy from your unspeakable sufferings and not a sigh for you is left  When that year was ended they came unto him the second year and said unto him We will not hide it from my Lord how that our money is  spent my Lord hath also our herds of cattle there is not ought left in the sight of my Lord but our bodies and our lands  If men make themselves sheep they will be devoured by the wolves  Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes both we and our land  Foolish people why reason so with him why endeavour to excite his compassion you were not his brethren  buy us and our land for bread  Now he will listen to you yes he will buy you but as cheap as possible  and we and our land will be ser∣vants to Pharaoh  then your troubles will be ended  and give us seed that we may live and not die that the land be not desolate  Because Pharaoh will now take care of you as he does of your cattle  And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh  Ye modern ministers who among you with all your buying and selling can compare to Joseph  for the Egyptians sold every man his field  Poor fellows  because the famine prevailed every where so the land became Pharaoh's  And as for the people he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof  Lest the sight of the fields and vineyards which once they possessed should create a seditious wish to be reinstated  Only the land of the priests bought he not  Joseph knew better than touch this nest of hornets there buzzings if roused might have awaked the lion He was too wise a man to neglect at such a sheering time to take the church into partnership with the state  for the priests had a portion  as hushmoney  assigned them of Pharaoh and did eat their portion  there is no fear of that  which Pharoah gave them wherefore they sold not their land  for they had no occasion  Hold up your heads now O ye landholders such are the equitable beginnings of your dominion over your depressed fellowcreatures Are you not in a  con  tries beholden to some timetaking Pharoah some hunting Nimrod or conquering  Norman for the share that ye hold of the spoils of mankind  As to Pharaoh had he been a father to his peo∣ple he had not taken such cruel advantage of their unequalled distress but content with a reasonable profit would as in duty bound have preserved them in independence  With respect to Joseph honest man like mi∣nisters in our days he was bound in conscience to provide for his own relations in the first place and if he took for himself and his master both the cat and the skin that is to say ALL he did not ex∣ceed what our modern Josephs would do if they had Egyptians to deal with However Joseph like many of his kidney outwitted himself for when another king arose who knew not Joseph his father's house and his own posterity were all used like the enslaved Egyptians and much worse and heavily felt the weight of that enormous power which he had set up Even so may it befall the houses of all oppressors and from their bondage may no Moses ever bless them with deliverance  Reasons which the Poor have to wish for a Reform in Parliament  From Cooper's Reply to Burke  BY an EFFECTUAL Reform however I do not mean the paltry manoeuvre of disfranchis∣ing the Boroughs and adding to the County Mem∣bers nor the equally objectionable measure of ad∣mitting only taxable householders to vote altho' formerly I had doubts upon this subject But it cannot be denied that by this means the larger part of the community the most important part of the community the most oppressed the most industrious part of the community those who  having the most reason to complain complain the least the cottager the mechani  and the day labourer or as that inveterate enemy of human kind Mr B  e would call them  the Swiniss Mu  i  ude  are placed in perpetual subjection to a corporationan aristocracy of property mor  less extended I do not mean this It is im  ∣ble to defend the system of disfranchising a f  y citizen because he is not so rich as his more fa∣voured neighbour Under any state of society pro∣perty always has had and will have full as much influence as it ought and it is gross ignorance in politics to and so many artificial to the natural inequalities among men Neither am I prepared to believe that public spirit and independence is exclusively confined to the rich so far as my ex∣perience goes the direct contrary is the fact and I almost suspect that  it is as easy for a cable to go thro' the eye of a needle  as for a man of large property to be a thorough patriot I am not pre∣pared to believe that public spirit is not among the poor man's virtues I know and confess the temp∣tations he is sometimes under to sacrifice his po∣litical opinions for his daily bread but so far as I have been able to judge it is not from want of principle that the poor give way but from want of knowledge kept as they are in the most de∣plorable ignorance of their political rightsen∣couraged to work hard and to drink hard but to think little and to read nothing no wonder they should barter their birth right for a mess of pot∣tage when they know too well the value of the one and know nothing about the other Suppos∣ing however that the want of independence may be a crime attached to poverty is it not evident that the way to create it if it does not exist and to confirm it if it does is to take for granted its existence Alas among other robberies committed upon the poor they are robbed of their good fame  and their honest character by proud and privileg∣ed law givers "depart it is in fact said by the  hall part of a nation to the larger" depart ye wretches ye Swinish Multitude ye RifRaf ye Scum of the earth ye are guilty of that epi∣tome of all the crimes of the decalogue ye are convicted of POVERTY What rights can ye pre∣tend to who have not a penny in your pockets Away to your dismal habitations and your scanty fair go work and be contented" How  posite are the sentiments of scripture and mo∣  ern politicians The Bible in the text above  uoted declares that riches are an obstacle in the  ay to the kingdom of heaven while among Eu∣opean legislators poverty and virtue are deemed  ncompatible Degrade a man in his own opinion  igmatize him by legal suspicion take for granted  hat he has no character to lose and you go the are way to work to make him in reality what you elieve him to be We have done so by the Jews  the contrary let him know that you place con∣  dence in his integrity that he  has  a character to  se by improper behaviour and that you expect  a matter of course that he will act as he ought  e chances are that he will feel his own dignity  nd justify the expectations you entertain of his  ood conduct Laws make manners It is a crime  e and a foul crime against human nature syste∣matically to debase in the eye of the public and their own opinion so large a portion of mankind  THE POOR unhappily form  Morcover those who have little deserve to have  at little the more carefully protected the less a  an possesses the less he can spare from his nar∣  ow store and at any rate even the poorest are  ossessors of the most invalu  hle species of pro∣perty life liberty and labour To infringe upon  ese directly or indirectly without the consent of  e owner is neither more nor less than tyranny  in the law that enacts it and slavery in the object who is compelled to submit to it  Neither can it be truly said that the poor ma  pays no taxes for he expends the produce of his labour in the most productive articles of modern taxation the necessaries of life The fire with which he warms his frozen limbs and dresses his scanty morselthe candle that enables his family to toil at the spinningwheel or the loom during those hours which the middling classes devote  relaxation from business and the great to the zenith of their pleasurable careerthe smallbeer tha  washes down his homely repastevery morsel o  his food every article of his apparel and eve  the scanty furniture of his cottage are all affected by the extravagance and mismanagement of tho  who govern The more taxes are required t  more hours he must labour to supply his wants and the more distant his prospect of obtaining the com∣forts and conveniences of existence  How little the interests of the poor are taken ca  of and how necessary it is that the voice of th  poor man should be heard with attention and re  ∣pect in the house of commons the numerous incl  sure bills are pregnant instances where as in t  fable of Nathan the prophet the poor man's lan  is seized to encrease the numerous herds of  richer and more powerful neighbours Whereas instead of dividing the commons and wastes amo  the rich natural justice and good policy wou  teach us to distribute them among the poor  There is a very important Book too little noticed an Essay the Right to Property in Land by Dr Ogilvie vo  B  we take good care to fulfil with the most scrupu∣lous orthodoxy that text of scripture  Ur  every one that hath shall be given and he sh  See Spence also on the same subject  have abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath  A still more flagrant instance of cruelty and in∣justice toward the poor is the practice of  impressing  The labour of the poor man constitutes the whole of his wealth and his domestic connections almost the whole of his happiness But on a sudden un∣der the dubious authority of a presswarrant he is cut off from his peaceful habitation and domestic society and forcibly dragged on board the floating prison of a tender he is compelled to labour in the dreadful service of murdering his fellowcreatures at the command of his superiors and paid such scanty wages not as he can earn or deserves but as the niggardly system of government finance thinks fit to allow His family mean while who look up to him for comfort and subsistence igno∣rant of his misfortune are anxiously expecting his wonted return perhaps their homely repast for the night depended on his earnings for the day but his usual hour of return to his family is gone by each passing footstep each noise of distant similarity is eagerly listened to in vain Hope still draws out the lengthened evening till a sleepless night of lamentation and despair succeeds the dreary melancholy hours of successive disappointment and fruitless expectation The next or succeeding day brings the mournful tidings of his destiny and leaves the widowed wife perhaps the pregnant mother to eke out a comfortless existence unde the accumulated pressure of want and labour an sorrow and disease  Innumerable are the cases of this nature that must of necessity attend the practice of impressing for soldiers and mariners But the miseries of the lower classes of society are borne in torpid silence and patient resignation The feeble voice of suf∣fering poverty can seldom extend beyond the hum∣ble  limits of her own habitation still less can it pe∣netrate the joyous mansions of the great or intrude on the pompous occupations of the statesmanotherwise it might truly suggest that even if WARS  be  necessary this tyrannical system of violence and robbery is not so It is the offspring of statepar∣simony alone Why not add a fourth▪ or a half to the common wages to induce volunteers Why not double the payWhy notBecause the overgrown fortunes of the rich landholders the monopolizers of wastes and commons would ex∣perience an almost imperceptible diminution While by the good old fashion of dragging away the poor by means of a pressgang no taxes are laid upon the wealthy and a due portion of the Swinish multitude the scum of the earth are pe∣riodically swept away as food for powder  Such are some among the numerous hardships of which the British poor have too much reason to complain Indigence one would think is of it∣self a sufficient evil to an inhabitant of society without being held out as a reproach or converted into a crime Why then should slavery be added to poverty and the rights of man be emerged in the misfortunes of the citizen A citizen indeed is an improper appellation the poor man is not a citizen for being denied  even by the spirit of the constitution  the privilege of representation he is subjected to the will of those who make and the power of those who execute the laws and he is at best but an inhabitant of his native land for the benefit of his richer neighbour  Hence I cannot help regarding any scheme of reform as insignificant to say no worse of it which shall not include in the scheme itself without trust∣ing to distant promises and fair professions some effectual means of raising and meliorating the con∣dition of what are called the lower classes of the people  Patriots  as Dr Johnson very shrewdly  and sarcastically remarked  are fond of levelling down to themselves but they seldom propose to level up to them∣selves  It is fit that this reproach should be done away from the advocates of a good cause It is the people the lower classes of society that constitute the bulk of mankind that form the great mass of capability and present to the politician the most important object of national improvement For my own part I care little in comparison for a re∣form that shall serve merely to diminish the taxes paid by the rich or gratify the wishes of senatorial orators or wouldbe statesmen whether in or out of parliament Away with such halfmeasured re∣formersmen of rank and respectability as they sometimes call themselves who desire no farther reform than to extend the aristocratic monopoly of power to that circle in which themselves are in∣cluded who make the people the stalkinghorse to their designs and the stepladder to the official situations which they aspire to obtain who have temperance and moderation in their mouths and pride and ambition in their hearts and who raise the hue and cry of violence innovation and re∣publicanism against every man who looks beyond the petty interests of a party or includes in his notions of patriotism a desire to promote not the privileges of a corporation but the rights of man  Hence also it is to me no matter of surprize that the people the multitude feel no interest in the repeated outcries for parliamentary reform when the evils they feel are hardly touched upon and advantages held out which they have no am∣bition to enjoy Who has yet talked of dividing the wastes and the commonsof abolishing tythesof rewarding populationof comfortably pro∣viding for the old age of the labourer the manus facturer the artificerof exonerating the poor from the indirect taxes which they pay without  knowing it as well as from the direct imposition which ministers secretly lay onand above all of providing ample means of PUBLIC INSTRUCTION that the poor man may know what his rights are and what is the object of government and what are the duties of the servants of the people That he may become if he chuses a human creature and not a machine and having the capacity of mental improvement given to him by his Maker that he may me as he ought the talent thus committed to his care Why should the truth be concealed There is among us too much inequality of ranktoo much inequality of richestoo much inequa∣lity of labour The poor work too much and know too little incessant labour stupifies the mental fa∣culties and produces an inclination to satisfy the cravings of nature beyond the necessities of nature Hence the amusements of the poor are gross their hours of relaxation intemperate and habits of drunkenness and expence are insensibly formed till the whole man is degraded and ignorance and poverty linked with him as companions for life I wish it were not true that these habits are rather encouraged than suppressed that nine tenths of the nation may be mere machines to execute the la∣bour of which the other tenth enjoys the profit  My notions then of an effectual reform in the representation of the people would take in the whole of that aristocratical apostate the Duke of Richmond's idea in his Letter to Colonel Sharman I would have the man whose stake in the commu∣nity consists of life and liberty and labour with a penny in his pocket to have an equal voice in the choice of legislators by whose laws that stake is to be protected with another man who has life and liberty and labour with a hundred thousand pounds in his pocket In comparison with the three first articles of the catalogue which are cotm∣mon to all men and which are the means to ihe  acquisition of the rest the last is of trifling mo∣ment it is the small dust of the balance an acci∣dent of existence of artificial and not of natural importance which when weighed against the solid gifts of nature to her common offspring will kick the beam  ON EQUALITY  From Cato's Letters  AS liberty can never subsist without equality nor equality be long preserved without an  Agrarian  law or something like it so when men's riches are become immeasurably or surprizingly great a people who regard their own security ought to make a strict enquiry how they came by them and oblige them to take down their own size for fear of terrifying the community or mastering it In every country and under every government particular men may be too rich  If the  Romans  had well observed the  Agrarian  law by which the extent of every citizen's estate was ascertained some citizens could never have risen so high as they did above others and con∣sequently one man could never have been set above all the rest and have established as  Caesar  did at last a tyranny in that great and glorious state I have always thought that an enquiry into men's fortunes especially monstrous fortunes raised out of the public like  Milton  's infernal palace as it were in an instant was of more importance to a nation than some other enquiries which I have heard of  But will some say is it a crime to be rich Yes certainly at the public expence or to the danger of the public A man may be too rich for a subject even the revenues of kings may be too  large It is one of the effects of arbitrary power that the prince has too much and the people too little and such inequality may be the cause too of arbitrary power It is as astonishing as it is melancholy to travel through a whole country as one may through many in  Europe  gasping under endless imposts groaning under dragoons and po∣verty and all to make a wanton and luxurious court filled for the most with the worst and vilest of all men Good God What hardheartedness and barbarity to starve perhaps half a province to make a gay garden And yet sometimes even this gross wickedness is called public spirit be∣cause forsooth a few workmen and labourers are maintained out of the bread and the blood of half a million  In those countries were the judgment of the people consulted things would go better but they are despised and esteemed by their governors  happy enough if they do not eat grass  and having no re∣presentatives or share in the government they have no remedy Such indeed is their misery that their case would be greatly mended if they could change conditions with the beasts of the field for then being destined to be eaten they would be bet∣ter fed such a misfortune is it to them that their governors are not  cannibals  Oh HAPPY Britain may'st thou continue ever so  For a conclusion As the preservation of pro∣perty is the source of national happiness whoever violates property or lessens or endangers it com∣mon sense says that he is an enemy to his country and public spirit says that he should feel its ven∣geance As yet in  England  we can speak such BOLD truths and we never dread to see the day when it will be safer for one man to be a traytor than for another man or for a whole people to call him so  Wherever public spirit is found dangerous she will soon be found dead  POPULAR LICENTIOUSNESS OR ANARCHY BUT OF SHORT DURATION  From Dr Price on Civil Liberty  GOVERNMENT is an institution for the be∣nefit of the people governed which they have power to model as they please and to say that they can have too much of this power is to say that there ought to be a power in the state su∣perior to that which gives it Being and from which all jurisdiction in it is derived Licentious∣ness which has been commonly mentioned as an extreme of liberty is indeed its opposite It is government by the will of rapacious individuals in opposition to the will of the community made known and declared in the laws A free state at the same time that it is free itself makes all its members free by excluding licentiousness and guarding their persons and property and good name against insult It is the end of all just govern∣ment at the same time that it secures the liberty of the public against  foreign  injury to secure the liberty of the individual against  private  injury I do not therefore think it strictly just to say that it belongs to the nature of government to entrench on private liberty It ought never to do this ex∣cept as far as the exercise of private liberty en∣croaches on the liberties of others That is it is licentiousness it restrains and liberty itself only when used to destroy liberty  It appears from hence that licentiousness and despotism are more nearly allied than is commonly imagined They are both alike inconsistent with liberty and the true end of government nor is there any other difference between them than that the one is the licentiousness of  great  men and the other the licentiousness of  little  men or that by the one the persons and property of a people are  subject to outrage and invasion from a king or a lawless body of  grandees  and that by the other they are subject to the like outrage from a  lawless mob  In avoiding one of these evils mankind have often run into the other But all well con∣stituted governments guard equally against both Indeed of the two the last is on several accounts the least to be dreaded and has done the least mis∣chief It may be truly said that if licentiousness has destroyed its thousands despotism has de∣stroyed its millions The former having little power and no system to support it necessarily finds its own remedy and  a people soon get out of the tumult and anarchy attending it  But a despotism wearing the form of government and being armed with its force is an evil not to be conquered with∣out dreadful struggles It goes on from age to age debasing the human faculties levelling all distinc∣tions and preying on the rights and blessings of societyIt deserves to be added that in a state disturbed by licentiousness there is an animation which is favourable to the human mind and which puts it upon exerting its powers But in  state habituated to a despotism all is still and tor∣pid A dark and savage tyranny stifles every ef∣fort of genius and the mind loses all its spirit and dignity  THE TRIUMPH OF TRUTH AND LIBERTY BY RICHARD LEE Author of a Volume of Poems lately Published  ROUSE indolent mortals why will ye remain  Thus neuter in LIBRTY's cause  With one noble effort unrivet the chain  That binds you to tyranny's laws  In vain you petition and urge your complaints  And mournfully seek for redress  The heart of oppression  disdains  to relent  Quite callous to all your distress  The FATHER OF MERCIES has given to MAN  This earth with the light and the air  Ten thousand kind blessings his liberal hand  Invites ALL his creatures to share  But tyrants would gladly monopolize all  Or SELL US what freely was given  Then will ye submit to this basest of thrall  And  purchase  the free gifts of Heaven  Let  tyrants  not think the CREATOR looks down  With total indifference on them  HE soon will assert the just rights of his throne  And the glory that's due to his name  The skies seem to redden with terrible wrath  And the grave is preparing their beds  The storm now impending is pregnant with death  And ready to burst on their heads  In vain they confederate with Hell and with Rome  To keep us in ignorance bound  OMNIPOTENT TRUTH shall their malice o'ercome  And spread the wide universe round  Sweet LIBERTY civil and sacred shall fly  On the wings of the GOSPEL OF PEACE  Before the bright blaze superstition shall die  And War and oppression shall cease  Thou Earth and ye Heavens exultingly sing  For MAN shall be fetter'd no more  No more be the jest of the  courtier  and  king  The  slave  and the  scorn  of their pow'r  All nature look gay and creation rejoice  For MAN is now doom'd to be free  And PROVIDENCE speaks with determined voice  To confirm the immortal decree  ERSKINE's DEFENCE OF PAINE AND THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS    Conninued from Page  vol  THAT his i e the kings title is from man and from every generation of man without regard to the determination of former ones hear from Mr Locke  "All men"  say they i e Filmer and his adherents  are born under government and therefore they cannot be at liberty to begin a new one Every one is born a subject to his father or his prince and is therefore under the perpetual tie of subjection and allegiance"  But it is plain mankind never owned nor considered any such natural  subjection that they were born in  to one or to the other that tied them without their own con∣sents to a subjection to them and their heirs  It is true that whatever engagements or pro∣mises any one has made for himself he is under the obligation of them but cannot by any com∣pact whatsoever bind his children or posterity for his son when a man being altogether as free as his father  any act of the father can no more give away the liberty of the son than it can of any body else  So much for Mr Locke's opinion of the Rights of Mankind Let us now examine his ideas of the supposed danger of trusting them with them  Perhaps it will be said that the people being ignorant and always discontented to lay the foundation of government in the unsteady opi∣nion and uncertain humour of the people is to expose it to certain ruin and no government will be able long to subsist if the people may set up a new legislature whenever they take offence at the old one To this I answer quite the contrary People are not so easily got out of their old forms as some are apt to suggest they  are hardly to be prevailed with to amend the ac∣knowledged faults in the frame they have been accustomed to and if there be any original de∣fects or adventitious ones introduced by time or corruption it is not an easy thing to be changed even when all the world sees there is an oppor∣tunity for it This slowness and aversion in the people to quit their old Constitutions has in the many revolutions which have been seen in this kingdom in this and former ages still kept us to or after some interval of fruitless attempts still brought us back again to our old legislative of kings lords and commons and whatever provocations have made the crown be taken from some of our princes heads they never carried the people so far as to place it in another line  Gentlemen I wish I had strength to go on with all that is material but I have read enough not only to maintain the true principles of government but to put to shame the narrow system of distrust∣ing the people  It may be said that Mr Locke went great lengths in his positions to beat down the contrary doctrine of divine right which was then endan∣gering the new establishment But that cannot be objected to Mr David Hume who maintains the same doctrine speaking of the Magna Charta in his history vol Page he says  It must be confessed that the former articles of the great Charter contain such mitigations and explana∣tions of the feudal law as are reasonable and equitable and that the latter involve all the chief outlines of a legal government and pro∣vide for the equal distribution of justice and free enjoyment of property the great object for which political society was founded by men  which the people have a perpetual and unalienable right to recall  and which no time nor precedent nor statute nor positive institution ought to  deter from keeping ever uppermost in their thoughts and attention  These authorities are sufficient to rest on yet I cannot omit Mr Burke himself who is if possible still more distinct on the subject speaking not of the ancient people of England but of colonies planted almost within our memories he says  If there he one fact in the world perfectly clear it is this that the disposition of the people of America is wholly averse to any other than a free government and this is indication enough to any honest statesman how he ought to adapt whatever power he finds in his hands to their case If any ask me what a free government is I answer THAT IT IS WHAT THE PEOPLE THINK SO AND THAT THEY AND NOT I ARE THE NATURAL LAWFUL AND COMPE∣TENT JUDGES OF THIS MATTER If they prac∣tically allow me a greater degree of authority over them than is consistent with any correct ideas of perfect freedom I ought to thank them for so great a trust and not to endeavour to prove from thence that they have reasoned amiss and that having gone so far by analogy they must hereafter have no enjoyment but by my plea∣sure  Gentlemen I am sorry to feel my time consider∣ably consumed before I am arrived at what I con∣ceive to be the material subject of your considera∣tion For all that I have been stating now is only to shew that there is not that novelty in the opinions of the defendant that should lead you to think that he does not  bona side  entertain them much less when connected with the history of his life which I therefore brought in review before youBut still the great question remains unargued Had he a right to promulgate these opinions Gentlemen if he entertained them I shall argue that he hadAnd although my arguments upon  the Liberty of the Press may not to day be honour∣ed with your or the court's approbation I shall retire not at all disheartened consoling myself with the reflection that a season may arrive for their receptionThe most essential freedoms of man∣kind have been but slowly and gradually received and so very late indeed do some of them come to maturity that not withstanding the attorneygene∣ral tells you that the very question I am now agi∣tating is most peculiarly for  your  consideration AS A JURY under our ANCIENT constitution yet I must remind both you and him that your juris∣diction to consider and deal with it at all in judg∣ment is but A YEAR OLDWhen before that late period I ventured to maintain this very RIGHT OF A JURY over the question of libel under the same  ancient  constitution I do not mean before my lord for the matter was gone to rest in the courts at least long before he came to sit where he does But when before a noble and reverend ma∣gistrate of the most exalted understanding and of the most uncorrupted integrity to give effect to it I had occasion to maintain it he treated me not with disregard indeed for of that his nature was incapable but he put me aside with indul∣gence as you do a child while it is lisping its prat∣tle out of season and if this had been tried then instead of now the defendant must have been in∣stantly convicted on the proof of the publication whatever  you  might have thought of his caseYet I have lived to see it resolved by an almost una∣nimous vote of the whole Parliament of England that I had all along been in the right If this be not an awful lesson of caution concerning opini∣ons where are such lessons to be read  Gentlemen I have insisted at great length upon the origin of government being in the consent of the people and detailed the authorities which you have heard upon the subject because I consider it to be not only a support but indeed the only foundation of the liberty of the press If Mr  Burke be right in HIS principles of government I admit that the press in my sence of its Freedom ought not to be free  nor free in any sense at all  and that all addresses to the people upon the sub∣ject of government and all speculations of amend∣ment of what kind or nature soever are illegal and criminalFor if the people have without possible recall delegated all their authorities they have no jurisdiction to act and therefore none to think upon such subjects and it is a libel to arraign government or any of its acts before those that have no jurisdiction to correct them But on the other hand as it is a settled rule in the law of England that the subject may always address a competent juris∣diction on every matter within it no legal argument can shake the freedom of the press in any sense of it if I am supporaed in my doctrines concerning the great unalienable rights of the people to change or reform their government  Gentlemen it is because the Liberty of the Press resolves itself into this great issue that it has been in every time and country the last liberty which subjects have been able to wrest from power Other liberties are held under governments but the liberty of opinion keeps governments them∣selves in due subjection to their duties This has produced the martyrdom of truth in every age and  the world has only purged itself from ignorance with the innocent blood of those who have enlightened it  Gentlemen my strength and time are wasted and I can only make this melancholy history pass like a shadow before you  I shall begin with the grand type and example  To be continued  POPULAR LICENTIOUSNESS OR ANARCHY BUT OF SHORT DURATION  From Dr Price on Civil Liberty  GOVERNMENT is an institution for the be∣nefit of the people governed which they  have power to model as they please and to say that they can have too much of this power is to say that there ought to be a power in the state su∣perior to that which gives it being and from which all jurisdiction in it is derivedLicentious∣ness which has been commonly mentioned as an extreme of liberty is indeed its opposite It is government by the will of rapacious individuals in opposition to the will of the community made known and declared in the laws A free state at the same time that it is free itself makes all its members free by excluding licentiousness and guarding their persons and property and good name against insult It is the end of all just government at the same time that it secures the liberty of the public against  foreign  injury to secure the liberty of the individual against  private  injury I do not therefore think it strictly just to say that it be∣longs to the nature of government to entrench on private liberty It ought never to do this except as far as the exercise of private liberty encroaches on the liberties of others That is it is licentious∣ness it restrains and liberty itself only when used to destroy liberty  It appears from hence that licentiousness and despotism are more nearly allied than is common∣ly imagined They are both alike inconsistent with liberty and the true end of government nor is there any other difference between them than that the one is the Licentiousness of  great  men and the other the Licentiousness of  little  men or that by the one the persons and property of a people are subject to outrage and invasion from a king or a lawless body of  grandees  and that by the other they are subject to the like outrage from a  lawless mob  In avoiding one of these evils mankind have often run into the other But all well constituted go∣vernments guard equally against both Indeed of the two the last is on several accounts the least  to be dreaded and has done the least mischief It may be truly said that if licentiousness has destroy∣ed its thousands despotism has destroyed its mil∣lions The former having little power and no system to support it necessarily finds its own re∣medy and  a people soon get out of the tumult and anar∣chy attending it  But a despotism wearing the form of government and being armed with its force is an evil not to be conquered without dreadful strug∣gles It goes on from age to age debasing the human faculties levelling all distinctions and preying on the rights and blessings of SocietyIt deserves to be added that in a state disturbed by licentiousness there is an animation which is fa∣vourable to the human mind and which puts it upon exerting its powers But in a state habit∣uated to a despotism all is still and torpid a dark and savage tyranny stifles every effort of ge∣nius and the mind loses all its spirit and dignity  The probable Influence of the French Revolution on the Liberties of Europe  From a Letter to  Mr Pitt  on his Apostacy from the cause of Parliamentary Reform  NOTHING indeed can be more evident than that a mighty change in the direction of the public sentiments of Europe is likely to arise from that revolution whether it be successful or un∣successful If it be successful the spirit of extreme democracy is likely to spread over all Europe and to swallow up in a volcanic eruption every rem∣nant of monarchy and of nobility in the civilized world The probability of such effects is so strong∣ly believed by the enemies of that revolution that it is the ground of their alarm the subject of their invective and the pretext of their hostilities It  was to prevent such consequences that Mr Burke so benevolently counselled the princes of Europe to undertake that  crusade  in which they are now so piously engaged  If on the other hand the efforts of France be unsuccessful if her liberties be destroyed there can be little doubt that such a shock will most pow∣erfully impel the current of opinion to the side of monarchy a direction in which it will be likely for several ages to continue The example of the destruction of the great French Republic would diffuse dismay and submission among a multi∣tude who only judge by events and the bloody scenes which must attend such a destruction would indeed be sufficient to appal the sternest and most ardent champions of liberty The spirit of Eu∣rope would crouch under the dark shade of des∣potism in dead repose and fearful obedience The royal confederacy which had effected this subver∣sion would doubtless continue its concert and its efforts The principle of maintaining the inter∣nal independence of nations being destroyed by the example of France no barrier would any long∣er be opposed to the arbitrary will of kings The internal laws of all the European states would be d  ctated by a council of despots and thus the in∣fluence of moral causes on public opinion coope∣rating with the combined strength and policy of princes "every faint vestage and loose remnant" of free government will be swept from the face of the earth  FAMILY DISTRESS  On a second Morning's contest for Freedom

vol OF LIMITED MONARCHY  I PROCEED to consider monarchy not as it exists in countries where it is unlimited and despotic but as in certain instances it has appear∣ed a branch merely of the general constitution  Here it is only necessary to recollect the objec∣tions which applied to it in its unqualified state in order to perceive that they bear upon it with the same explicitness if not with great force un∣der every possible modification Still the go∣vernment is founded in falsehood affirming that a certain individual is eminently qualified for an important situation whose qualifications are per∣haps scarcely superior to those of the meanest member of the community Still the government is founded in injustice because it raises one man for a permanent duration over the heads of the  est  of the community not for any moral recommenda∣tion he possesses but arbitrarily and by accident Still it reads a constant and powerful lesson of immorality to the people at large or exhibiting pomp and splendour and magnificence instead of virtue as the index to general veneration and esteem The individual is not less than in the most absolute monarchy unfited by his education to become either respectable or useful He is un∣justly and cruelly placed in a situation that engen∣ders ignorance weakness and presumption after having been stripped in his infancy of all the ener∣gies that should defend him against the inro  ds of these adversaries Finally his existence implies that of a train of courtiers and a series of intrigue of servility secret influence capricious partialities and pecuniary corruption So true is the observa∣tion of Montesquieu that "we must not expect under a monarchy to find the people virtuous"  But if we consider the question more narrowly we shall perhaps find that unlimited monarchy has other absurdities and vices which are peculiarly its own In an absolute sovereignty the king may if he psease be his own minister but in a limited one a ministry and a cabinet are essential parts of the constitution In an absolute sovereignty princes are acknowledged to be responsible only to God but in a limited one there is a responsibility of a very different nature In a limited monarchy there are checks one branch of the government coun∣teracting the excesses of another and a check without responsibility is the most flagrant of all contradictions  It was a confused feeling of these truths that in∣trodueed into limited monarchies the principle "that the king can do no wrong  This it must be confessed is a maxim of the English law but whatever meaning it may have the examples of Edward II Richard II Charles I and James II sufficiently prove that the kings of England are neither incapable of doing wrong nor exempt from being punished for it Note added by one of the Swinish Mul∣titude  " Observe  the peculiar consistency of this proceeding Con∣sider what a specimen it affords us of plain dealing frankness and unalterable sincerity An indivi∣dual is first appointed and endowed with the most momentous prerogatives and then it is pretend∣ed that not he but other men are answerable for the abuse of these prerogatives This pretence may appear tolerable to men bred among the ficti∣ons of law but justice truth and virtue revolt from it with indignation  Having first invented this fiction it becomes the business of such constitutions as nearly as pos∣sible to realise it A ministry must be regularly formed they must concert together and the measures they execute must originate in their own discretion The king must be reduced as nearly as possible to a cypher So far as he fails to be completely so the constitution must be imperfect  What sort of a figure is it that this miserable wretch exhibits in the face of the world Every thing is with great parade transacted in his name He assumes all the inflated and oriental style which has been already described and which indeed was upon that occasion transcribed from the practice of a limited monarchy We find him like Pharaoh's frogs "in our houses and upon our beds in our ovens and our kneading troughs"  Now observe the man himself to whom all this importance is annexed To be idle is the abstract of all his duties He is paid an immense revenue only to dance and to eat to wear a scarlet robe and a crown He may not choose any one of his measures He must listen with docility to the consultations of his ministers and sanction with a ready assent whatever they determine He must not hear any other advisers for they are his known and constitutional counsellors He must not ex∣press to any man his opinion for that would be a sinister and unconstitutional interference  To be absolutely perfect he must have no opinion but be the vacant and colouriess mirror by which theirs is reflected He speaks for they have taught him what he should say he affixes his signature for they inform him that it is necessary and proper  A limited monarchy in the articles I have de∣scribed might be executed with great facility and applause if a king were what such a constitution endeavours to render him a mere puppet regu∣lated by pullies and wires  Such a monarch has been projected and as the scheme may possibly please the pigs is will follow this extract  But it is perhaps the most egregious and palpable of all political mistakes to imagine that we can reduce a human being to this state of neutrality and torpor He will not exert any useful and true activity but he will be far from passive The more he is excluded from that energy that characterises wisdom and virtue the more depraved and unreasonable will he be in this caprices Is any promotion vacant and do we expect that he will never think of bestowing it on a favourite or of proving by an occasional election of his own that he really exists This promotion may happen to be of the utmost importance to the public welfare or if not every promotion un∣meritedly given is pernicious to national virtue and an upright minister will refuse to assent to it A king does not fail to hear his power and prero∣gatives extolled and he will no doubt at some time wish to essay their reality in an unprovoked war against a foreign nation or against his own citizens  Such then is the genuine and uncontrovertible scene of a mixed monarchy An individual placed at the summit of the edifice the centre and the fountain of honour and who is neutral or must seem neutral in the current transactions of his go∣vernment This is the first lesson of honour vir∣tue and truth which mixed monarchy reads to its subjects Next to the king come his admini∣stration  and the tribe of courtiers men driven by a fatal necessity to be corrupt intriguing and venal sciected for their trust by the most ignorant and illinformed of their countrymen made solely accountable for measures of which they cannot solely be the authors threatened if dishonest with the vengeance of an injured people and if honest with the surer vengeance of their sove∣reign  s displeasure The rest of the nation the subjects at large  Was ever a name so fraught with degradation and meanness as this of subjects I am it seem by the very place of my birth become a subject Of what or whom Can an honest man consider himself as the subject of any thing but the laws of justice Can he acknowledge a superior or hold himself bound to submit his judgment to the will of another not less liable than himself to prejudice and error Such is the idol that monarchy wor∣ships in lieu of the divinity of truth and the sacred obligation of public good It is of little conse∣quence whether we vow fidelity to the king and the nation or to the nation and the king so long as the king intrudes himself to tarnish and under∣mine the true simplicity the altar of virtue  Are mere names beneath our notice and will they produce no sinister influence upon the mind May we bend the knee before the shrine of vanity and folly without injury Far otherwise Mind had its beginning in sensation and it depends upon words and symbols for the progress of its associa∣tions The true good man must not only have a heart  esolved but a front erect We cannot practise objection hypocrisy and meanness without be∣coming degraded in other men's eyes and in our own We cannot "bow the head in the temple of Rimmon" without in some degree apostatising from the divinity of truth He that calls a king a man will perpetually hear from his own mouth the  lesson that he is unfit for the trust reposed in him he that calls him by any sublimer appellation is hastening fast into the most palpable and dangerous errors  But perhaps "mankind are so weak and imbe∣cile that it is in vain to expect from the change of their institutions the improvement of their charac∣ter" Who made them weak and imbecile Pre∣viously to human institutions they had certainly none of this defect Man considered in himself is merely a being capable of impression a recipient of perceptions What is there in this abstract cha∣racter that precludes him from advancement We have a faint discovery in individuals at present of what our nature is capable why should individuals be fit for so much and the species for nothing Is there any thing in the structure of the globe that forbids us to be virtuous If not if nearly all our impressions of right and wrong flow from our intercourse with each other why may not that in∣tercourse be susceptible of modification and amend∣ment It is the most cowardly of all systems that would represent the discovery of truth as useless and teach us that when discovered it is our wis∣dom to leave the mass of our species in error  There is not in reality the smallest room for scepticism respecting the omnipotence of truth Truth is the pebble in the lake and however slowly in the present case the circles succeed each other they will infallibly go on till they over∣spread the surface No order of mankind will for ever remain ignorant of the principles of justice equality and public good No sooner will they un∣derstand them than they will perceive the coinci∣dence of virtue and public good with private in∣terest nor will any erroneous establishment beable effectually to support itself against general opinion In this contest sophistry will vanish and mischie∣rous institutions sink quietly into neglect Truth  will bring down all her forces mankind will be her army and oppression injustice monarchy and vice will tumble into a common ruin  Let us beware by an unjustifiable perversion of terms of confounding the common understanding of mankind A king is the well known and stand∣ing appellation for an office which if there be any truth in the arguments of the preceding chap∣ters has been the bane and the grave of human virtue Why endeavour to purify and exorcise what is entitled only to execration why not suf∣fer the term to be as well understood and as cordi∣ally detested as the once honourable appellation of tyrant afterwards was among the Greeks Why not suffer it to rest a perpetual monument of the folly the cowardice and misery of our species  A RECEIPT TO MAKE A KING  From  Common sense or the Englishman's journal  for  May  Supposed to be written by the late Henry Fielding Esq  IF I were a Corsican I should certainly be a re∣bel that is I should hazard my life and estate to recover my liberty but if after all I must sub∣mit to be a slave I would be a slave to Baron Nieuhoff  Theodore Baron Nieuhoff elected King of Corfica  or even to a Russian Bojar rather than to my old task masters of Genoa  The Corfican chiefs if they would be advised by me should form the plan of their future govern∣ment even while their affairs are low and the event uncertain lest hereafter they suffer great∣er evils than ever yet they have felt by intestine divisions and are prompted by a spirit of jealousy or ambition to destroy one another when they have no other enemies to conquer Were I to  preside in their council and the direction of this important affair were to be left to my judgment I would not make choice of any form of government which is now administered in the world neither would I borrow my system from Plato's republic or Sir Thomas More's Utopia which sound well in theory but can never be reduced to practice In short I would preserve the rank and dignity of my country by restoring the ancient form of go∣vernment which was  kingly  or  monarchial  A king I would have and a king with a crown on his head and a scepter in his hand to whom should be given the title of royal or imperial ma∣jesty But my king should not be a tyrant He should be even incapable of committing any acts of violence or oppression He should be entirely free from pride avarice and ambition He should neither injure himself or his subjects through the heat and intemperance of youth or the folly and dotage of old age Love which has made one king a fool and another mad should never per∣plex his head or hurt his constitution His man∣ners should be without blemish and his greatest enemies if undeservedly he must have enemies should not be able to impute to him any impurity of mind any unfriendly disposition or unevenness of temper In a word I would have such a king as Jupiter first gave to the frogs  See the fable of the frogs who petitioned Jupiter for a king  who by the way possessed his empire by divine right and therefore his subjects were justly punished by his successor for the insults which they offered to his person and character However I would not have a plain unfashionable Log My prince should be made of the heart of oak and wrought into the shape and figure of a man by the most skilful artists in Eu∣rope  To speak intelligibly I would have an image or statue as big as the life well shaped and finely  painted with a diadem on his head a royal mantle on his shoulders and a scepter in his right hand He should be placed under a rich canopy and seated on a magnificent throne A guard of an hundred halberdeers should be ap∣pointed to attend him not so much for the secu∣rity of his person as to serve for pomp and shew at the audience of ambassadors This guard should be the only standing army in Corsica For as there could be no use for soldiers but to defend the country in case of an invasion so in that case every man should be a soldier There should be an established militia in which all the male inha∣bitants from eighteen to fifty years of age capa∣ble of bearing arms should be inrolled as is prac∣tised at this day among the SwissCantons This militia should be provided with good arms and regularly exercised The generals colonels and regularly exercised The generals colonels and all inferior officers should be named by the senate as well as all other officers military and civil among the rest I include all the great officers of the crown  c  But then it should not be lawful for any officer to excercise the employment confer∣red on him till his nomination had been con∣firmed by the king who should always be allowed a negative voice  In like manner new laws should be of no force till they had received his majesty's approbation which should always be signified by his silence But whenever he refused his assent he must be obliged to pronounce the word VETO three times with an audible voice so that it might be distinct∣ly heard by all the people  Having thus secured the liberties of the subject I think it in the next place incumbent on me as a Corsican legislator to maintain the dignity of the crown I would not indeed ordain it as an article of faith that the king held the reins of his govern∣ment by a divine indefeasible right but yet I would  have his person sacred and inviolable His sub∣jects of all degrees and orders should approach him with the greatest reverence Those who were it i  troduced to him for a confirmation of their pri∣vileges and employments should be obliged to pros∣trate themselves and kiss the hem of his garment No person should presume to sit or spit or cough or be covered in his presence unless it might here∣after be thought proper as a reward for great merit and services to create a class of  grandees  A Spanish grandee keeps his hat on in the king's presence He increated by the words be covered without further ceremony  Foreign ministers who are sent to compliment the king on his accession must observe the cere∣monial established at the court of Turin when the King of Sardinia was acknowledged in that quality All proper laws should be devised for his security And therefore if any one should be so audacious as to steal away his majesty or to maim or disfigure his person or to rob him of his crown or sceptre or any part of his robes the of∣fender should be guilty of treason and be punish∣ed with death  If any person should propose in writing or con∣versation to abolish the present form of govern∣ment by deposing his wooden majesty and sub∣stituting in his stead a monarch of flesh and blood whether man woman or beast the offender should likewise be guilty of hightreason Provided always that the words be express and sufficiently proved and that no free Corsican be vexed or punished by  innuendos  and forced constructions or for any figurative allegorical or ambiguous speeches Provided likewise that this law shall not extend to restrain the freedom of debate in the senate and council  But now I desire it may be understood that in this new scheme of government which I have in∣vented for the good people of Corsica I only re∣quire  the substance of the king's person to be of oak I do not absolutely insist that he must al∣ways retain a human form Let it be varied accord∣ing to the exigencies of the state or the humours of the people  For the matter I prefer the oak to all other tim∣ber on account of its duration and because that tree considered only as a simple vegetable bears some analogy to a crown'd head it having been held sacred in all countries and ages of the world The ancient Druids paid a greater veneration to the oak than to the most illustrious of the sons of Adam And even among us Englishmen in a very inquisitive and polite age I mean about the mid∣dle of the last century this tree obtained the title of  royal  The Greeks and Romans had so great a reverence for this tree as to imagine that every oak was the habitation of a divinity and there was an oaken grove within one of the gates of Rome where all the trees were worshipped as so many nymphs and goddesses  But the most renowned of all their species were the Epirotick oaks the illustrious natives of Dodo∣na who were not only endued with human speech but were prophets and poets the most exalted characters of mankind and by which two of the greatest princes in the world have been so eminent∣ly distinguished  If the compass of my paper would allow it I would add much more in honour of the oak But what I have said may suffice to prevent the ridi∣cule of political writers and the objections and indignities which they might otherwise offer to my wooden king  I am fully persuaded there is not a monarch now living upon the earth who would not think himself very happy and blessed above all his bre∣thren to be heart of oak especially if he be turned of fifty And the blessing would be dou∣bled  if by this change he might be allowed to de∣rive his pedigree from the house of Dodona In truth an oak of this family is capable of governing the greatest kingdoms even the vast empire of China and Japan How would the people of those countries admire his eminent qualities and the faculties of his mind And I am sure they would not presume to find fault with his person and fa∣mily who was descended from as ancient a stock and formed of as good stuff as their gods How∣ever I ingenuously confess that the oaks of this race are not for my purpose and must therefore be excluded from my scheme of government Prophets of all complections nations and religi∣ons whether great or small whether false or true when they are once made kings will claim an ab∣solute independent sovereignty The history of all ages and the actions of all the royal prophets from King David down to King Mahomet sufficiently verify my assertion For that reason I recommend the oaks of Dodona to the government of the east where every king and every viceking is a tyrant  As for the monarchs of Corsica according to my establishment they must not have the use of speech and then they will have no use for power Wherefore I advise those islanders to content them∣selves with kings that are the growth of their own woods if they have any woods left If not they may import a good stout king of any size well shaped and polished and fashionably dressed from any great city on the continent  The principal manufactories of this sort are thought to be the Hague in Holland and a little insignificant place in some part of Germany the name of which I cannot immediately recollect but believe it begins with an H  I must submit to the consideration of the senate whether they will be at the charge of a queen For as she can contribute nothing to the succession the expence of the sculpture her royal vestments servants and  officers will be an unnecessary incumbrance on the civil list besides I can prove from ancient history that a wooden queen hath sometimes done as much mischief as a wooden horse and overturned mighty kingdoms  I would certainly provide by the strongest laws that no priest should have a vote in the senate or council nor any employment about the person of his Corsican majesty I should be under dreadful apprehensions lest those teeming heads exalt my king into a god and then tax the people to fur∣nish provisions for his table  Seest thou not how he eateth and drinketh and thinkest thou not that he is a god  In which case the theocracy of the wood∣en god would prove the worst kind of tyranny For this little island would soon be devoured to manifest the power of the governor and support the luxury of his ministers who are better crafts∣men than to be discovered like those idiot priests of Bel by a trap door and a sack of ashes strewed upon the pavement  Whilst I am writing this I am informed by the Holland mail that King Theodore has abdicated the crown of Corsica and is now imprisoned for debt at Amsterdam  He was long confined on the same account in the King's Bench prison and died soon after his discharge under the insol∣vent debtors act having given up his kingdom for the benefit of his creditors  Though I am as truly con∣cerned for the misfortune of this enterprising mo∣narch as any of his loving subjects yet I must own it lessens my grief to consider that this sud∣den revolution will make way for my proposal and facilitate the accession of my wooden king For which reason I will direct these short hints to be translated into Italian for the use of the Cor∣sican chiefs and the people now in arms under their command  How shall I rejoice to be the instrument of giv∣ing  them a king who to speak without a figure can do no wrong a succession of such princes would not be less glorious for themselves than be∣neficial to their country They would be univer∣sally esteemed during their reigns and their me∣mories sweet and precious Happy had it been for the world if the long catalogue of Roman emperors three or four only excepted had been of the wooden species  Reason which is the distinguishing excellence of human nature can only prove a blessing to those whether princes or private persons who are men of honour and virtue  ON KINGS From a Lampoon entitled the Restoration  BY WILMOT EARL OF ROCHESTER  For the printing of which he was banished  If of all christian blood the guilt  Cries loud of vengeance unto

HATE of  monarchs  but the BLISS of MEN  EQUAL GOVERNMENTS WILL TEND TO MAKE MEN BETTER  From Barlow's Advice to the privileged Orders  AS an apology for the existing despotisms it is said That all men are by nature tyrants and will exercise their tyrannies whenever they find opportunity Allowing this assertion to be true it is surely cited by the wrong party It is an apology for equal and not for unequal govern¦ments and the weapon belongs to those who contend for the republican principle If govern¦ment be founded on the vices of mankind it  business is to restrain those vices in all rathe  than to foster them in a few The disposition to tyrannize is effectually restrained under the exer∣cise of the Equality of Rights while it is not only rewarded in the few but invigorated in the many under all other forms of the social connexion But it is almost impossible to decide among moral propensities which of them belong to Nature and which are the offspring of Habit how many of our vices are chargeable on the permanent quali∣ties of man and how many result from the mutable energies of state  If it be in the power of a bad government to render men worse than nature has made them why should we say it is not in the power of a good one to render them better And if the latter be capa∣ble of producing this effect in any perceivable de∣gree where shall we limit the progress of human

longs to act the tyrant in his turn  Nor longs alone but hopes  before he dies  To have his rents and live on tears and sighs  A FURTHER ACCOUNT OF SPENSONIA  Continued from page Vol II  THE continent not being far distant from the Island of Spensonia produced several inter∣views between the respective inhabitants and of  course frequent traffickings and dealings which on the part of the Spensonians were conducted with the utmost simplicity and good faith This uprightness gained much on the affections of the Indians and naturally produced a yet nearer com∣munication Contrary to expectation they here saw a people much superior in the comforts of life as independent as themselves and though Christians without those  odious tyrants  to mankind LAND∣LORDS "How" said an Indian to a Spensonian "How is it that you have no Landlords We ne∣ver heard that men could be civilized or be Chris∣tians without giving up their common right to the earth and its natural produce to tyrants called Landlords Among such people according to uni∣versal report the land is claimed by a few indivi∣duals who dispose of it at pleasure and parcel it out to others for tribute or rent Many colonies of Christians have established themselves in various parts of America and carry on here as in their original country the iniquitous traffick in the soil They expel or exterminate us the natives because we will not work or pay rent to them for living in our own country neither have these Europeans the common honesty to share equally among them∣selves their unrighteous plunder but levy rents of each other here as they do at home Yes their religion it seems will not allow of equality of rights Their God they tell us has ordained that there shall be many  sorts and conditions of men  and that some few shall have the lordship and disposal of the earth whilst the far greater part must be re∣duced to supplicate to become their tributaries and vassals This has always made us hate your God and your religion Justice being impartiality par∣tiality must be injustice and that God who is so partial cannot be just and not being just cannot be loved We cannot love injustice nor the pro∣moters of injustice Neither can we freeborn Indians submit to pay homage or rent to any man  for leave to dwell on the earth though he should say that God would have it so But you say  you  are Christians and that you  nevertheless  have  no  Landlords but have an equitable way of enjoying the common benefits of this island which you in∣habit and yet preserve to each man his independ∣ence This is very amazing to me"  The curiosity of this Indian was satisfied he was made to comprehend the brotherly system and that the God of the Christians was belied by design∣ing priests colleagued with overbearing knaves and that he did not approve but condemned and punished injustice usurpation and oppression  The enraptured Indian sighed for the domestic happiness of civilized life combined with his na∣tive independence He was adopted a citizen and was happy Other Indians heard saw and fol∣lowed the example The island now became very populous and highly cultivated and many villages encreased to large towns adorned with public edi∣fices and other marks of opulence and refinement Trade flourished ships were built and commerce extended to distant shores its reciprocal blessings  In this state of prosperity says the author of this account did I find this rising colony when by accident some years ago our ship was driven upon this happy island  I like the aforesaid Indian was astonished when I understood their system of government and man∣ner of holding landed property For instead of anarchy idleness poverty and meanness the na∣tural consequences as I narrowly thought of a ridiculous levelling scheme I saw nothing but or∣der industry wealth and magnificence So being anxious to know the utmost of this newfashioned commonwealth I took occasion to have my doubts resolved by a communicative Spensonian as follows  Author  And so none notwithstanding the splendid appearance the country makes and the extensive manner  in which trade is carried on have estates nor can pur∣c  ase any  Spensonian  No nor is it likely ever will nor does the happiness of human life or business re∣quire any such refarious traffick  Auth  Would it not tend to make the people more in∣dustrious if they could lay out their riches in possessions  Spen  If they were more industrious in order to buy land other people being reduced to be their tenants would through poverty and oppression be dep  ived of the means of industry and by de∣spair of the incitement to it Being possessed of landed property men would cease to be otherwise industrious than in watching their tenants in or∣der to raise their rents and infringe their liberties Their posterity also would become equally useless except in the same laudable business of oppression The same pretence as to objects of industry might extend to religion and the persons of men Why should traffic be denied to monied men in any thing capable of being an object of commerce But why despair of industry You see no want of it among us No nor yet among the Jews though neither they nor we can buy land but on the contrary you see a general industry not one idle Riches unsupported by an estate would soon take wings if dot prevented by industry But in your coun∣try Europe for I know your customs we came originally from England what great incitement pray can it be to industry to give the cream of one's endeavours unthanked to the Landlord For what Landlord was ever yet thankful for his rents They think the tenants rather owe thanks to them for permission to live on theit earth forsooth  Wi' glooman brow the Laird seeks in his rent  It's not to gie  His honour maunna want he poinds your gear  Syne driven frae house and hald where will ye steer  ALLAN RAMSAY  Curse them I never can think of them but with detestation I can compare them and their castles to nothing but the giants and their castles in ro∣mances Those giants were said to be a terror and dest  uction to all the people around so in reality are the dukes lords and barons of the present day Therefore the stories of enormous and tyrannical giants dwelling in strong castles which have been thought fabulous may reasonably be looked upon as disgaised truths and to have been invented as just satires upon great lords For if those fabu∣lous monsters were said to eat the people and their children your real monsters of Landlords really eat their meat and the savour out of every enjoy∣ment reducing them to such misery that eating their bodies as the giants did would be much more beneficent They toil them to death in their endless drudgery harass and butcher them in their villainous wars and drag them from every social connection These are the monsters or giants that the world want to be rid of The extirpation of these should employ the philanthropic giantkil∣lers the deliverers of mankind  Auth  But notwithstanding all your heat against those Landlords those monsters as you call them I should like to know why you think they will never get crept in among you as they have in all other civilized nations  Spen  Why you must know the interest of every individual is so intimately and palpably con∣nected with our present system that the least in∣novation would immediately be felt and of course opposed People are generally very much attached to their landed propenty and societies in particu∣lar are very tenacious of such especially when they as we do find daily the benefit thereof Then can we suppose any would be so hardy as attempt to touch a whole nation in so sensible a part  Auth  But bribery my friend bribery that is the invincible Leviathan that overturns the rights of man∣kind  That may get among you and numbers may be hired to sell the interests of the public both present and future for a little present gain and be ready either to vote or fight against them  Spen  Well I will let you see that though you were to bribe the whole nation you could do no∣thing by voting and that you must have a very large majority before you can have any chance by fighting You must understand we never vote but by ballot or in a secret manner either in parochial or parliamentary business Now suppose you would bribe the whole of the voters in any affair and I were one of them I would reason thus with my∣self If I vote as I am brihed to do I must do wrong to the public whose interest includes also my own and perhaps the interest likewise of pos∣terity If there be but one vote against my briber he may say it is mine and if I deny it so may he that gave this vote and has as good a chance to be believed there being no witnesses whereby I will have the mortification to have wronged my coun∣try and conscience without being able to clear myself in your sight So in consequence of this reasoning I would vote against you and so would every one else from the same consideration Let us see how this case will stand then Why you would chide me privately for you durst not do it public∣ly for not voting for you though hired I would say how do you know that Because say you I have not one vote  for remember if you had but one vote I would lay claim to it  and therefore not yours What not one vote I would exclaim No not one say you Well then I would an∣swer I have the comfort to think I am no worse than others This will teach you to come hither again to buy votes Besides if I had voted for you others might have claimed with you the merit of the d  ed while I would have had the whole of the guilt and at best an equal share of  the suspicion So there is an end to your hurting us by voting  Auth  I am now convinced that so long as you vote by ballot or secretly there does not appear a possibility of hurting you in that quarter But is it not beneath  reemen to vote thus clandestin  ly as if afraid to act honestly in the face of the world Moreover you lose all the praise of your good deeds which is a general incite∣ment to worthy actions  Spen  In your country they vote in the open manner you commend What is the consequence Why the Ministry tells you it is necessary to have a majority on their side for the dispatch of busi∣ness which amounts to the same thing as pleading for no parliament at all A majority therefore is procured in a very honourable way no doubt she minority not being bought for a majority is suffi∣cient take every opportunity to shew their impor∣tance by opposing all business indiscriminately whether right or wrong Indeed they have often but too much reason to oppose yet let their ha∣rangues be ever so violent they can never make the majority understand in any other way than the Minister would have them for they are too fast asleep in the lap of corruption to regard either their arguments or the praises of their country Thus you see the weak influence of fame which you build so much on even among senators what strength must it then have among the poor free∣holders and burghers after so glorious an ex∣ample  This general corruption and conflict of interests furnish endless materials for newspapers pamph∣lets and state coblers Thousan  of abo  tive schemes are daily proposed for redressing grievan∣ces and mending the constit  tion whereas the shoes were so i  lmade at first are so worn rotten and patched already that they are not worth fur∣ther trouble or expence but ought to be thrown to  the dunghill and a new pair should be made neat tight and easy as for the soot of one that loves free∣dom and lease Then would your controversies about this and the other way of cobling that continu∣ally agitate you be done away and you would walk along the rugged and dirty path of life easy and dryshod  And now you shall witness with your own eyes that force is likely to succeed as ill against us as secret corruption Therefore you must go with me tomoorow a few miles off it being a ge∣neral review day when the inhabitants of several parishes together are to go through their military exercise under the eye of a general provided by the state Every parish or ward of a parish exer∣cise themselves at their own convenience but two or three times a year several parishes are affembled together as I said to accustom themselves to act in large bodies as you will see tomorrow  Accordingly next morning we were roused early by the drums all over the country beating to arms No man lagged behind that was able to march but my friend luckily for me happened to be lame yet not so as to prevent his hobbling there to be a spectator I was a stranger and therefore had no∣thing to do with them and so went with my friend also to look on The morning was exceeding fine the military ground was spacious and kept always in pasturage for that purpose The parishes in different liveries came marching in from every di∣rection with artillery banners and music Those who had good horses were horsemen and formed into troops according to the colour of their horses The very boys too were furn  shed with small arms and classed according to their sizes It was de∣lightful to behold so many thousand citizen soldiers in arms only of defence an army of  men who their duties know and know their rights and knowing dare maintain  In short they made  a gallant appearance and every one was adorned with what little ornament his rank and uniform admitted of as medals received for improvements public services c Every eye sparkled with de∣light and every countenance was expressive of happiness for this is their most agreeable sport Emulative obedience to command and dexterity of action was every where conspicuous What contributed much to this was that nothing but eminent merit can advance any to be officers who must pass through every station to the highest if their merit can carry them so far They went through their several manceuvres like veterans but the boys in particular made a pleasing sight No play whatever gives them such delight as this military exercise which they apply to with such diligence that before they leave school or are fit for other employments they are as complete there∣in as the oldest For this purpose all due encou∣ragement is given them a particular instance of which appeared at this time They made a mock fight with the men and drove them off the ground which close the review Every party then with colours flying as they came marched to their re∣spective homes to spend the remainder of the day in festivity and joy  The merry bells now sounded from every steeple The glad females after feasting their manly spouses and paramours prepared for the dance and thro' the evening revelled in pleasures known to love and innocence alone Among other sports there were shooting matches and cudgel playing which are favourite diversons and encouraged on such days as this by medals from the parishes The victors are very proud of these medals and as observed before wear them on extraordinary oc∣casions and field days  I can never enought admire the beauty of the country It has more the air of a garden or ra∣ther  a paradise than a gencral country scene and indeed it is only a continuation of gardens and orchards For besides the infinite number of real gardens the very fields meadows and pastures are plentifully strewed with fruit trees and the corn is cuitivated in rows and as carefully as garden herbs The houses and every thing about them are so amiably neat and so indicative of domestic happiness so far distant from the inslated pomp and ghastly solemnity of the palaces of the great and the confined miserable depression of the ho∣vels of the wretched that they seem the habita∣tions of rational be  ngs of beings worthy the ap∣probation of the Deity because though as he de∣signed them they be lords of all his works  they pre∣sume not be Lords of each other  On expressing my surprize at so much private felicity and public convenience my friend an∣swered "The parishes build and repair houses make roads plant hedges and trees and in a word do all the business of a Landlord And you have seen what sort of Landlords they are I suppose you do not meet with much to repair or improve And it is no wonder for a parish has many heads to contrive what ought to be done Instead of de∣bating about mending the state as with you for ours needs no mending we employ our ingenuity nearer home and the result of our debates are in every parish how we shall work such a mine make such a river navigable drain such a fen or improve such a waste These things we are all immediately interested in and have each a vote in executing and thus we are not mere spectators in the world but as all men ought to be actors and that only for our own benefit"  The next day following we commenced again our political conversation as follows  Spen  Now our whole country is trained and peopled as you have seen I therefore suppose you  have dropt all hopes of fighting us out of our Li∣berties and if there were a possibility of voting them away we would not nevertheless part with them Nay we will not suffer any law in the least impolitic to give us uneasiness long for we are too knowing and too powerful to be imposed upon or browbeat which makes our Parliament very careful how they make laws  Auth  I must indeed own that you have no great reason to be afraid of any encroachment on your consti∣tution whilst you continue your two guardian angels I mean  VOTING BY BALLOT  and  THE UNIVERSAL U  E OF ARMS  But I beg the same liberty to make ob∣juctions that my countryment will be apt to take when I inform them of your uncommon customs that I may be the more enabled to answer them Do not people repine that the place they occupy is not their own that they must pay rent that they cannot do with it what they please and that they cannot enfeoss their posterity with the improv  ments they may make  Spen  So you think that the unreasoning desires of wayward individuals should be complied with to the detriment of a whole people Private pro∣perty in land is either just according to the law of nature or it is not That it is not is evident from the unnatural and oppressive consequences flowing from it If all tyranny and abuses in government flow only from that monopolizing system it must of course be the fountain head of tyranny search history and see that the govern∣ment of every country ever was and is in the proprietors of land If then the people wish to have the government in their own hands they must begin first by taking the land into their own hands  Who is the Lord Paramount of the universe Is he not God He then and he alone or those whom he deputes must have the rents Now the  ipture says that the has given the earth to the  children of men given it to mankind in common Then mankind in their respective districts are his substitutes and representatives and have a right to receive and dispose of the revenues arising from the Domains which he in his providence permits them severally to possess Some will say that though God gave the earth to the chidren of men in com∣mon they may have private possessions I answer yes if they live far I mean  very far  asunder But in no populous country since the beginning of the world was private property in land enjoyed but to the detriment of multitudes of the same community Suppose a populous country were divided equally among the inhabitants as was the land of Canaan among the Israelites how long would their shares continue equal In a few years some men's fami∣lies would increase and others decrease which would scon produce inequality of estates even though neither the right of primogeniture nor alienation of property were allowed Those who became heirs to those decreased families would become richer and those who had but a small share among many brethren of their paternal inheritance would become poorer and even a periodical jubi∣lee would not prevent injustice and inequality But by sharing the rents man's equal rights and dignity is preserved in every generation and in every state of population If God be just he must approve of so just and impartial a system We presume that he is so and that he is not displeased at his revenues being disposed of so much to the happiness of mankind  We then admit but of ONE LORD as we do of ONE GOD and in his name our rents are collected and disposed of as we believe according to his will and pleasure We do not murmer as you suppose at paying rent How should we when we consider for whose use it is Does not the ren  paid here serve instead of taxes and rates of ever  description and is it not wholly at our own d  s∣posal And when the public establishments are provided for is not the remainder divided equally among us If when premises become vacant by death or otherwise they be let to the best bidder is not that the fairest way It shews no parti∣ality and prevents collusion to the prejudice of the public  And do you think that the people while a man lives and pays his rent will be so ungene∣rous as turn him out of his house or farm NoTo prevent families indeed from looking on their tenements as hereditary the public may think it prudent at the decease of a man or his widow to take again their property into their own hands and dispose of it again to the best bidder And what just reasons will the sons have to complain Are they not part of that public whose interest every man ought to promote and be jealous of for his own sake But to prevent all colour of injustice on account of improvements medals and premi∣ums are always bestowed on those while they live who remarkably improve the public property Your European landlords give no such rewards nor shew such favour on account of improve∣ments that you need to surmise so many idle grie∣vances under a system of purity sufficient for the heavens  I could not in my heart teaze my friend any further with my frivolous objections for I was fully convinced that if ever there be a millen∣nium or heaven upon earth it can only exist under the  benign  SYSTEM of SPENSONIA  The wise and beneficient regulations and lawse∣minating from this system of simplicity are beyond conception beautiful and conducive of public happiness Many instances might be given which other societies not built on the public good can  never adopt For example If any man possess an invention or secret in medicine or other science or art of importance to mankind the state does not first tax the possessor by selling him a patent and then load his manufactures with stamps and duties thereby counteracting as much as pos∣sible the kind intentions of the deity in blessing his creatures with such an invention No the parliament is  obleged  to purchase the secret and publish it Remember I say  obliged  for as it is only for purposes evidently useful that their go∣vernment dare dispose of the public money at all so neither dare they be sparing when public uti∣lity demands it Thus no quacks or imposters under pretence of secrets are suffered to impose on mankind to ruin their healths or pick their pockets Neither does any complain that his in∣ventions or his labours have been unrewarded through all the  happy regions of  SPENSONIA  YE SHEEPISH MULTITUDE TAKE CARE OF

circulating libraries bookclubs reading societies and clubs for peri∣odical publications  To remedy this evil several proposals have been made to the government by patriotic men  Picha  ly the members

Analytical Review for March  COURTEOUS reader we announce to thee the publication of the Second part of the Rights of Man Wert thou pleased with the first part Thou wilt be delighted with the second Didst thou say of the former such a work deserves no other consutation than that of criminal justice Thou wilt say of this the only way to answer it is to hang the author  For our parts we wish neither to kindle thy hopes nor to provoke thy horrors Lo we in∣troduce thee to the author and leave thoe and him to settle the proper mode of confutation Only keep your tempers We will sit by and as re∣viewers of the controversy will occasionally break silence We will also take the liberty of dropping at the close a few remarks to qualify your tem∣pers if you should chance to disagree  Thou wilt perceive reader at the outset that Mr P so far from thinking he has received any defeat from the replies made to his former publica∣tion conceives himself to stand on an eminence asserts a victory and claims a triumph p vii  'Several other reasons contributed to produce this determination of deferring the remainder of his work I wished to know the manner in which a work written in a style of thinking and expression different to what had been customary in England would be received before I proceeded farther A great field was opening to the view of mankind by means of the French Revolution Mr Burke's outrageous opposition thereto brought the controversy into England He attacked prin∣ciples which he knew from information I would contest with him because they are principles I believe to be good and which I have contributed  to establish and conceive myself bound to defend Had he not urged the controversy I had most probably been a silent man  'Another reason was that Mr Burke promised in his first publication to renew the subject at ano∣ther opportunity and to make a comparison of what he called the English and French Constitu∣tions I therefore held myself in reserve for him He has published two works since without doing this which he certainly would not have omitted had the comparison been in his favour  'In his last work  "His appeal from the new to the old Whigs"  he has quoted about ten pages from the  Rights of Man  and having given himself the trouble of doing this says  he shall not attempt in the smallest degree to refute them  meaning the principles therein contained I am enough ac∣quainted with Mr Burke to know that he would if he could But instead of contesting them he immediately after consoles himself with saying that "he has done his part"He has not done his part He has not performed his promise of a comparison of constitutions He started the con∣troversy he gave the challenge and has fled from it and he is now a  case in point  with his own opi∣nion that  "the age of chivalry is gone"  'The title as well as the substance of his l  st work his  "Appeal"  is his condemnation Prin∣ciples must stand on their own merits and if they are good they certainly will To put them un∣der the shelter of other men's authority as Mr Burke has done serves to bring them into suspi∣cion Mr Burke is not very fond of dividing  s honours but in this case he is artfully dividing the disgrace  'But who are those to whom Mr Burke has made his appeal A set of childish thi  kers and halfway politicians born in the last century men who went no farther with any principle than as it  suited their purpose as a party the nation was al∣ways lest out of the question and this has been the character of every party from that day to this The nation sees nothing in such works or such politics worthy its attention A little matter will move a party but it must be something great that moves a nation  'Though I see nothing in Mr Burke's Appeal worth taking notice of there is however one expression upon which I shall offer a few remarks After quoting largely from the  Rights of Man  and declining to contest the principles contained in that work he says  this will most probably be done  if such writings shall be thought to deserve any other refutation than that of criminal justice  by others who may think with Mr Burke and with the same zeal  'In the first place it has not yet been done by any body Not less I believe than eight or ten pamphlets intended as answers to the former part of the "Rights of Man" have been published by different persons and not one of them to my knowledge has extended to a second edition nor are even the titles of them so much as generally remembered As I am averse to unnecessarily mul∣tiplying publications I have answered none of them And as I believe that a man may write himself out of reputation when nobody else can do it I am careful to avoid that rock  'But as I would decline unnecessary publicati∣ons on the one hand so would I avoid every thing that might appear like sullen pride on the other If Mr Burke or any other person on his side the question will produce an answer to the "Rights of Man" that shall extend to an half or even to a fourth part of the number of copies to which the Rights of Man extended I will reply to his work But untill this be done I shall so far take the sense of the public for my guide and the world knows  I am not a flatterer that what they do not think worth while to read is not worth mine to answer I suppose the number of copies to which the first part of the  Rights of Man  extended taking En∣gland Scotland and fieland is not less than be∣tween forty and fifty thousand  Mr P taking the common notion of the excel∣lency of the English constitution Mr P will ex∣cuse our using that expression to be fallacious and aiming to prepare his readers for remarks on its imperfections proceeds as follows P XIV  'As to the prejudices which men have from education and habit in favour of any particular form or system of government those prejudices have yet to stand the test of reason and reflection In fact such prejudices are nothing No man is prejudiced in favour of a thing knowing it to be wrong He is attached to it on the belief of its being right and when he sees it is not so the prejudice will be gone We have but a defective idea of what prejudice is It might be said that until men think for themselves the whole is pre∣judice and  not opinion  for that only is opinion which is the result of reason and reflection I offer this remark that Mr Burke may not conside too much in what has been the customary preju∣dices of the country  'I do not believe that the people of England have ever been fairly and candidly dealt by They have been imposed upon by parties and by men assuming the character of leaders It is time that the nation should rise above those trifles It is time to dismiss that inattention which has so long been the encouraging cause of stretching taxation to excess It is time to dismiss all those songs and toasts which are calculated to enslave and ope∣rate to suffocate reflection On all such subjects men have but to think and they will neither act wrong nor be misled To say that any people are  not fit for freedom is to make poverty their choice and to say they had rather be loaded with taxes than not If such a case could be proved it would equally prove that those who govern are not fit to govern them for the  are a part of the same national mass  'But admissing government  o be changed all over Europe it certainly  be done without convulsion or revenge It is not worth making changes or revolations unless it be for so ne great national benefit and when this shall appear to a nation the danger will be as in America and France to those who oppose'  Speaking of the expectations to be formed from the prevailing bias towards revolutions in different nations our author of serves P  'As revolutions have begun and as the proba∣bility is always greater against a thing beginning than of proceeding after it has begun it is natural to expect that other revolutions will follow The amazing and still encreasing expences with which old governments are conducted the numerous wars they engage in or provoke the embarrassments they throw in the way of universal civilization and commerce and the oppression and usurpation they act at home have wearied out the patience and exhausted the property of the world In such a situation and with the examples already exist∣ing revolutions are to be looked for They are become subjects of universal conversation and may be considered as the  Order of the day  'If systems of government can be introduced less expensive and more productive of general happiness than those which have existed all at∣tempts to oppose their progress will in the end be fruitless Reason like time will make its own way and prejudice will fall in a combat with in∣terest If universal peace civilization and com∣merce are ever to be the happy lot of man it  cannot be accomplished but by a revolution in the system of governments All the monarchical go∣vernments are military War is their trade plun∣der and revenue their objects While such go∣vernments continue peace has not the absolute security of a day What is the history of all mo∣narchical governments but a disgustful picture of human wretchedness and the accidental respite of a few years repose Wearied with war and tired with human butchery they sat down to rest and called it peace This certainly is not the con∣dition that Heaven intended for man and if  this be monarchy  well might monarchy be reckoned among the sins of the Jews  'The revolutions which formerly took place in the world had nothing in them that interested the bulk of mankind They extended only to a change of persons and measures but not of principles and rose or sell among the common transactions of the moment What we now behold may not impro∣perly be called a  "counter revolution"  Conquest and tyranny at some early period dispossessed man of his rights and he is now recovering them And as the tide of all human affairs has its ebb and flow in directions contrary to each other so also is it in this Government sounded on a  moral theory on a system of universal peace on the indefea∣sible hereditary Rights of Man  is now revolving from west to east by a stronger impulse than the government of the sword revolved from east to west It interests not particular individuals but nations in its progress and promises a new aera to the human race'  This work is divided into five chapters present∣ing remarks on society and civilizationon the origin of the present old Governments among the old governments comes poor old Englandon the old and new systems of governmentson constitu∣tions  ways and means of improving the condition of Europe  With respect to the chapter on civilization we cannot help expressing our admiration of many re∣marks which betray great political capacity and much originality of thought Mr Paine supposes from the interest men have in society that the in∣stances in which a formal government has any real benefit are few and that the more perfect civili∣zation is the sess occasion there is for government Our author observes P  'If we look back to the riots and tumults which at various times have happened in England we shall find that they did not proceed from the want of a government but that government was itself the generating cause instead of consolidating so∣ciety it divided it it deprived it of its natural cohesion aud engendered discontents and disorders which otherwise would not have existed In those associations which men promiscuously form for the purpose of trade or of any concern in which government is totally out of the question and in which they act merely on the principles of society we see how naturally the various parties unite and this shews by comparison that go∣vernments so far from being always the cause or means of order are often the destruction of it The riots of had no other source than the re∣mains of those prejudices which the government itself had encouraged But with respect to En∣gland there are also other causes  'Excess and inequality of taxation however disguised in the means never fail to appear in their effects As a great mass of the community are thrown hereby into poverty and discontent they are constantly on the brink of commotion and deprived as they unfortunately are of the means of information are easily heated to outrage What∣ever the apparent cause of any riots may be the  real one is always want of happiness It shews that something is wrong in the system of govern∣men that injures the felicity by which society is to be preserved  In speaking of the origin of the old governments Mr P traces monarchy to a banditti of Ruffians Do but hear him p  'It is impossible that such governments as have hitherto existed in the world could have com∣menced by any other means than a total violation of every principle sacred and moral The obscu∣rity in which the origin of all the present old go∣vernments is buried implies the iniquity and dis∣grace with which they began The origin of the present government of America and France will ever be remembered because it is honourable to record it but with respect to the rest even flat∣tery has consigned them to the tomb of time with∣out an inspiration  'It could have been no difficult thing in the early and solitary ages of the world while the chief employment of men was that of attending flocks and herds for a banditti of ruffians to over∣run a country and lay it under contributions Their power being thus established the chief of the band contrived to lose the name of robber in that of monarch and hence the origin of monar∣chy and kings  'The origin of the government of England so far as relates to what is called its line of monarchy being one of the latest is perhaps the best record∣ed The hatred which the Norman invasion and tyranny begat must have been deeply rooted in the nation to have outlived the contrivance to obliterate it Though not a courtier will talk of the curfeu bell not a village in England has for∣gotten it'  These remarks however though they will ap∣ply  to most of the monarchies which have been established will certainly not apply to all  When treating on the origin of the old and new systems of government our author makes the fol∣lowing severe reflections on hereditary govern∣ment p  'Government ought to be a thing always in full maturity It ought to be so constructed as to be superior to all the accidents to which individual man is subject and therefore hereditary successi∣on by being  subject to them all  is the most irregu∣lar and imperfect of all the systems of government  'We have heard the  Rights of Man  called a  le∣telling  system but the only system to which the word  levelling  is truly applicable is the hereditary monarchical system It is a system of  mental level∣ling  It indiscriminately admits every species of character to the same authority Vice and virtue ignorance and wisdom in short every quality good or bad is put on the same level Kings succeed each other not as ra  ionals but as ani∣mals It signifies not what their mental or moral characters are Can we then be surprited at the abject state of the human mind in monarchial countries when the government itself is formed on such an abject levelling systemIt has no fixed character To day it is one thing tomorrow it is something else It changes with the temper of every succeeding individual and is s  bject to all the varieties of eaeh It is government through the medium of passions and accident It appears under all the various characters of childhood de∣crepitude dotage a thing at nurse in leadingstrings or in crutches It reverses the wholesome order of nature It occasionally puts children over men and the conceits of nonage over wis∣dom and experience In short we cannot con∣ceive a more ridiculous figure of government than hereditary succession in all its cases presents  'Could it be made a degree in nature or an  adict registered in heaven and man could know in that virtue and wisdom should invariably appertain to hereditary succession the objections to it would be removed but when we see that nature acts as if she disowned and sported with the hereditary system that the mental characters of successors in all countries are below the average of human understanding that one is a tyrant another an ideot a third insane and some all three together it is impossible to attach confidence to it when reason in man has power to act'  In speaking on the tendency of elective govern∣ments many political writers have spoken of them as the cause of civil wars Mr Paine on the other hand contends that civil wars which have origi∣nated from contested hereditary claims are more numerous and have been more dreadful and of longer continuance than those which have been occasioned by elective governments Mr Paine's views here correspond to the reflections made on the same subject by the illustrious sufferer Algernon Sidney  One hardly can help smiling at the following remark p  'Whether I have too little sense to see or too much to be imposed upon whether I have too much or too little pride or of any thing else I leave out of the question but certain it is that what is called monarchy always appears to me a filly contemptible thing I compare it to some∣thing kept behind a curtain about which there is a great deal of bustle and fuss and a wonderful air of seeming solemnity but when by any accident the curtain happens to be opened and the com∣pany see what it is they burst into laughter'  Whether the remark be true or false we do not determine  fed risum teneatis amici  If those which follow be all true however dis∣posed  as we were to smile we could not avoid being grave p  'That monarchy is all a bubble a mere court artifice to procure money is evident at least to me in every character in which it can be viewed It would be impossible on the rational system of representative government to make out a bill of expences to such an enormous amount as this de∣ception admits Government is not of itself a very chargeable institution The whole expence of the federal government of America founded as I have already said on the system of represen∣tation and extending over a country ten times as large as England is but six hundred thousand dol∣lars or one hundred and thirtyfive thousand pounds sterling  'I presume that no man in his sober senses will compare the character of any of the kings of Eu∣rope with that of General Washington Yet in France and also in England the expence of the civil list only for the support of one man is eight times greater than the whole expence of the federal government in America To assign a rea∣son for this appears almost impossible The ge∣nerality of people in America especially the poor are more able to pay taxes than the generality of people either in France or England  'But the case is that the representative system diffuses such a body of knowledge throughout a nation on the subject of government as to explode ignorance and preclude imposition The craft of courts cannot be acted on that ground There is no place for mystery no where for it to begin Those who are not in the representation know as much of the nature of business as those who are An affectation of mysterious importance would there be scouted Nations can have no secrets and the secrets of courts like those of individuals are always their defects'  'Our author after stating the manner in which America proceeded in forming her constitution still insists on what he had formerly advanced viz that England has no constitution Whether truly or no we leave others to decide We will just quote a word or two on this subject  'In England p it is not difficult to perceive that every thing has a constitution except the nation Every society and association that is established first agreed upon a number of original articles digested into form which are its consti∣tution It then appointed its officers whose pow∣ers and authorities are deseribed in that constituti∣on and the government of that society then com∣menced Those officers by whatever name they are called have no authority to add to alter or abridge the original articles It is only to the con∣stituting power that this right belongs  'From the want of understanding the difference between a constitution and a government Dr Johnson and all writers of his description have always bewildered themselves They could not but perceive that there must necessarily be a  con∣trouling  power existing somewhere and they placed this power in the discretion of the persons exer∣cising the government instead of placing it in a constitution formed by the nation When it is in a constitution it has the nation for its support and the natural and the political countrouling powers are together The laws which are enacted by go∣vernments countroul men only as individuals but the nation through its constitution countrouls the whole government and has a natural ability so to do The final controuling power therefore and the original constituting power are one and the same power'  Having as he thinks demolished the doctrine of an 'English constitution' he then drops a word or two on precedents c  'In numerous instances he says P the precedent ought to operate as a warning and not as an example and requires to be shunned instead of imitated but instead of this precedents are ta∣ken in the lump and put at once for constitution and for law  'Either the doctrine of precedents is policy to keep a man in a state of ignorance or is it a prac∣tical confession that wisdom degenerates in govern∣ments as governments increase in age and can only hobble along by the stilts and crutches of precedents How is it that the same persons who would proudly be thought wiser than their prede∣cessors appear at the same time only as the ghosts of departed wisdom How strangely is antiquity treated To answer some purposes it is spoken of as the times of darkness and ignorance and to an∣swer others it is put for the light of the world  'If the doctrine of precedents is to be followed the expences of government need not continue the same Why pay men extravagantly who have but little to do If every thing that can happen is already in precedent legislation is at an end and precedent like a dictionary determines every case Either therefore government has arrived at its dotage and requires to be renovated or all the occasions for exercising its wisdom have oc∣curred'  In speaking on the expences of government our author is sometimes very affecting and sometimes very indignant  P 'It is inhuman to talk of a million ster∣ling a year paid out of the public taxes of any country for the support of any individual whilst thousands who are forced to contribute thereto  pining with want and struggling with misery Government does not consist in a contrast between  ons and palaces between poverty and pomp it is not instituted to rob the needy of his mite  and increase the wretchedness of the wretched But of this part of the subject I shall speak hereaf∣ter and confine myself at present to political ob∣servations  'When extraordinary power and extraordinary pay are allotted to any individnal in a government he becomes the center round which every kind of corruption generates and forms Give to any man a million a year and add thereto the power of creating and disposing of places at the expence of a country and the liberties of that country are no longer secure What is called the splendor of a throne is no other than the corruption of the state It is made up of a band òf parasites living in luxurious indolence out of the public taxes  'When once such a vicious system is establish∣ed it becomes the guard and protection of all in∣ferior abuses The man who is in the receipt of a million a year is the last person to promote a spirit of reform lest in the event it should reach to himself It is always his interest to defend in∣ferior abuses as so many outworks to protect the citadel and in this species of political fortification all the parts have such a common dependence that it is never to be expected they will attack each other  'It is scarcely possible to touch on any subject that will not suggest an allusion to some corruption in governments The simile of "fortifications" unfortunately involves with it a circumstance which is directly in point with the matter above alluded to  'Among the numerous instances of abuse which have been acted or protected by governments ancient or modern there is not a greater than that of quartering a man and his heirs upon the public to be maintained at its expence  'Humanity dictates a provision for the poor but by what right moral or political does any government assume to say that the person called the Duke of Richmond shall he maintained by the public Yet if common report is true not a beggar in London can purchase his wretched pittance of coal without paying towards the civil list of the Duke of Richmond Were the whole produce of this imposition but a shilling a year the iniquitous principle would be still the same but when it amounts as it is said to do to not less than twenty thousand pounds per ann the enormity is too serious to be permitted to remainThis is one of the effects of monarchy and aristocracy  'In stating this case I am led by no personal dislike Though I think it mean in any man to live upon the public the vice ori∣ginates in the government and so general is it become that whe∣ther the parties are in the ministry or in the opposition it makes no difference they are sure of the guarantee of each other'  'Monarchy would not have continued so many ages in the world had it not been for the abuses it protects It is the masterfraud which shelters all others By admitting a participation of the spoil it makes itself friends and when it ceases to do this it will cease to be the idol of courtiers'  Every hereditary claim Mr Paine not only treats as a great absurdity but as a severe cruelty as proceeding from a system which while it ag∣grandizes one branch of a family impoverishes all the rest making them either beggars or pension∣ers The younger branches of families thus made needy and dependent too untaught to pursue a line of industry and too highspirited to submit to poverty throw themselves on the mercy of go∣vernment and become either tools or knaves  Whatever sentiments particular readers may form on some part of this work there are we appre∣hend in the last chapter remarks entitled to the serious consideration of all parties respecting the expences of government the baneful tendency of charters and corporationsthe oppressive nature of our taxes on the poor arising from the very formation of our government and our boasted sys∣tem of representation which many writers as well as Mr Paine ridicule as fallacious and theoretical or despise as necessarily corruptible and oppres∣sive the progress of taxation in Englandthe necessary expences of governmentand the means of disposing of the surplus taxes  In remarking on what Mr Burke said relative to the House of Peers the following fact is produ∣ced which Mr Paine calls a fact not to be paral∣leled in the history of taxation  P 'Notwithstanding taxes have encreased and multiplied upon every article of common consump∣tion the land tax which more particularly affects this 'pillar' has diminished In the amount of the landtax was  l  which is half a million less than it produced almost an hundred years ago  'See Sir John Sinclair's History of the Revenue' The land tax in was l  notwithstanding the rentals are in many instances doubled since that period  'Before the coming of the Hanoverians the taxes were divided in nearly èqual proportions between the land and articles of consumption the land bearing rather the largest share but since that aera nearly thirteen millions annually of new taxes have been thrown upon consumption The con∣sequence of which has been a constant encrease in the number and wretchedness of the poor and in the amount of the poorrates Yet here again the burthens does not fall in equal proportions on the aristocracy with the rest of the community Their residences whether in town or country are not mixed with the habitations of the poor They live apart from distress and the expence of reliev∣ing it It is in manufacturing towns and labouring villages that those burthens press the heaviest in many of which it is one class of poor support∣ing another  'Several of the most heavy and productive taxes are so contrived as to give an exemption to this pillar thus standing in its own defence The tax upon beer brewed for sale does not affect the aristocracy who brew their own beer free of this duty It falls only on those who have not conveni∣ency or ability to brew and who must purchase it in  small quantities But what will mankind think of the justice of taxation when they know that this tax alone from which the aristocracy are from circum∣stances exempt is nearly equal to the whole of the landtax being in the year and it is not less now than  l  and with its proportion of the taxes on malt and hops it exceeds itThat a single article thus partially consumed and that chiefly by the working part should be subject to a tax equal to that on the whole rental of a nation is perhaps a fact not to be parelleled in the histories of re∣venues'  'The taxes levied by William the Conqueror beginning in the year were  l  In the year they had decreased to Five hundred years after the conquest the annual amount of taxes was  l  Annual amount of taxes in  l  exclusive of the expence of collection and the drawbacks which are nearly  l  more' The difference be∣tween the first years and the last three con∣tinues Mr P is so astonishing as to warrant an opinion that the national character of the English has changed About  l  of this sum is ap∣propriated to pay the interest of the national debt  Mr Paine supposes from a variety of circum∣stances taken together that the annual expenditure might be fixed at  l  The surplus of more than  l  out of the present current expen∣ces he supposes might be disposed of as follows The poor rates might be abolished and in lieu of them a remission of taxes might be made to the poor of double the amount of those rates out of the surplus taxes By which means the poor would be benefited  l  and the housekeepers  l  This remission he supposes to be applied to the edu∣cation of poor children and the support of old people past their labour to the education of chil∣dren of a class of people who though not strictly  poor are incapable of giving their children educa∣tion to the relief of workmen making the demand on the birth of a child and of every new married couple claiming in like manner and  l  to defray the funeral expences of persons who travelling for work die at a distance from their friends  l  to what he calls 'a world of little cases' arising particularly in London To make up the deficiency necessary to supply the demand of these cases he proposes to add  l  the tax laid on coals in London 'so iniquitously and wantonly applied to the support of the Duke of Richmond The sum of  l  of the current expences Mr Paine wonld apply as fol∣lows  l  to the relief of disbanded soldiers additional pay to the remaining soldiers  l  To the officers of the disbanded corps  l  to the disbanded navy the same sum amounting to  l  the total  l  he also proposes that as any part of this half million falls in part of the taxes may be taken off There now remain at least one million and an half of surplus taxes he therefore proposes that the tax on houses and win∣dows may be taken off amounting to  l    s    d  ¼ and the surplus of  l  of sur∣plus taxes to be kept in reserve for incidental mat∣ters  In this plan of reform Mr Paine proposes that the commutation tax may be taken off and that there be substituted in its room a tax on estates so regulated as to destroy the unnatural law of primo∣geniture so fruitful of corruptions at elections  Our author also proposes that the laws regulat∣ing workmens wages should be abolished and the yet remaining sum of surplus taxes  l  he proposes to be applied to increase the salary of the inferior revenue officers and of the inferior clergy  Though we have already exceeded the bounds of our review we cannot avoid transcribing the following passages  p 'When a nation changes its opinion and habits of thinking it is no longer to be go∣verned as before but it would not only be wrong but bad policy to attempt by force what ought to be accomplished by reason Rebellion consists in forcibly opposing the general will of a nation whether by a party or by a government The  e ought therefore to be in every nation a method of occasionally ascertaining the state of public opi∣nion with respect to government On this point the old government of France was superior to the present government of England because on extra∣ordinary occasions recourse could be had to what was then called the States General But in Eng∣land there are no such occasional bodies and as to those who are now called Representatives a great part of them are mere machines of the court placemen and dependants  'I presume that though all the people of Eng∣land pay taxes not an hundreth part of them are electors and the members of one of the houses of parliament represent nobody but themselves There is therefore no power but the voluntary will of the people that has a right to act in any matter respecting a general reform and by the same right that two persons can confer on such a subject a thousand may The object in all such prelimi∣nary proceedings is to find out what the general sense of a nation is and to be governed by it If it prefer a bad or defective government to a reform or chuse to pay ten times more taxes than there is occasion for it has a right so to do and so long as the majority do not impose conditions on the minority different from what they impose on themselves though there may be much error there is no injustice Neither will the error continue  long Reason and discussion will soon bring things to rights however wrong they may begin By such a progress no tumult is to be apprehended The poor in all countries are naturally both peaceable and grateful in all reforms in which their interest and happiness is included It is only by neglecting and rejecting them that they become tumultuous'  Mr P seldom touches upon religion His rea∣son he assigns as follows  p 'I have carefully avoided to enlarge upon the subject because I am inclined to believe that what is called the present ministry wish to see contentions about religion kept up to prevent the nation turning its attention to subjects of go∣vernment It is as if they were to say  'Look that way or any way but this'  ERSKINE's DEFENCE OF PAINE  AND THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS  Continued from Page  Vol II  THE universal God of naturethe Saviour of mankindthe fountain of all light who came to pluck the world from eternal darkness expired upon a cross the scoff of infidel scorn and his blessed apostles followed him in the train of Martyrs When he came in the flesh he might have come like the Mahometan prophet as a pow∣erful sovereign and propagated that religion with an unconquerable sword which even now after the lapse of ages is but slowly moving under the influence of reason over the face of the earth But such a process would have been inconsistent with his mission which was to confound the pride and to establish the universal rights of men he came therefore in that lowly state which is repre∣sented  in the gospel and preached his consolations to the poor  When the foundation of this religion was dis∣covered to be invulnerable and immortal we had political power taking the church into partnership thus began the corruptions both of religion and civil power and hand in hand together what havock have they not made in the world ruling by ignorance and the persecution of truth but this very persecution only hastened the revival of letters and liberty which was to destroy the one and to raise up the other Nay you will find that in the exact proportion that knowledge and learning have been beat down and fettered they have destroyed the governments that bound them The court of Starchamber the first restriction of the press in England was erected previous to all the great changes in the constitution From that moment no man could legally write without an imprimatur from the state but truth and freedom found their way with greater force through secret channels and the unhappy Charles unwarned by a free press was brought to an ignominious death  When men can freely communicate their thoughts and their sufferings real or imaginary their pas∣sions spend themselves in air like gunpowder scat∣tered upon the surface but pent up by terrors they work unfeen like subterraneous fire burst forth in earthquake and destroy every thing in their course Let reason be opposed to reason and argument to argument and every good go∣vernment will be safe  The usurper Cromwell pursued the same sys∣tem of restraint in support of his government and the end of it speedily followed  At the restoration of Charles the Second the Starchamber ordinance of was worked up into an act of Parliament and was followed up during that reign and the short one that followed  it by the most sanguinary prosecutions but what fact in history is more notorious than that this blind and contemptible policy prepared and has∣tened on the revolution At that great aera these cobwebs were all brushed away The freedom of the press was regenerated and the country ruled by its affections has since enjoyed a century of tranquility and gloryThus I have maintained by English history that in proportion as the press has been free English government has been se∣cure  Gentlemen I will now support the same im∣portant truth by very great authorities Upon a subject of this kind resort cannot be had to lawcases The ancient law of England know nothing of such libels they began and should have end∣ed with the Starchamber What writings are slanderous of individuals must be looked for where these prosecutions are recorded but upon general subjects we must go to general writers If indeed I were to refer to obscure authors I might be an∣swered that my very authorities were libels in∣stead of justifications or examples but this cannot be said with effect of great men whose works are classics in our language taught in our schools and printed under the eye of government  Gentlemen I shall begin with the poet Milton a great authority in all learningIt may be said indeed he was a republican but that would only prove that REPUBLICANISM IS NOT INCOMPATI∣BLE WITH VIRTUE it may be said too that the work which I cite was written against previous licencing which is not contended for today But in my opinion if every work is to be adjudged a libel which is adverse to the wishes of govern∣ment or to the opinions of those who may try it the revival of a licencer would be a security to the public For if I present my book to a magis∣trate appointed by law if he rejects it I have  only to forbear from the publication and in the forbearance I am safe and he too is answerable for the abuse of his authority But upon the argument of today a man must print at his peril without any guide to the principles of judgment upon which his work may be afterwards prose∣cuted and condemned Milton's argument there∣fore applies and was meant to apply to every interruption to writing which while they op∣press the individual endanger the state  "We have them not" says Milton  that can be heard of from any ancient state or polity or church nor by any statute left us by our ances∣tors elder or later nor from the modern custom of any reformed city abroad but from the most antichristian council and the most tyran∣nous inquisition that ever existed Till then books were ever as freely admitted into the world as any other birth  the issue of the brain was no more stifled than the issue of the womb  To the pure all things are pure not only meats and drinks but all kind of knowledge whether good or evil the knowledge cannot defile nor consequently the books if the will and conscience be not defiled  Bad books serve in many respects to discover to confuse to forewarn and to illustrate Where∣of what better witness can we expect I should produce than one of your own now sitting in Parliament the chief of learned men reputed in this land  Mr Selden  whose volume of natural and national laws proves not only by great au∣thorities brought together but by exquisite reasons and theorems almost mathematically demonstrative that all opinions yea errors known read and collated are of main service and assistance toward the speedy attainment of what is truest  Opinions and understanding are not such  wares as to be monopolized and traded in by tickets and statutes and standards We must not think to make a staple commodity of all the knowledge in the land to mark and licence it like our broadcloth and our woolpacks  Nor is it to the common people less than a reproach for if we be so jealous over them that we cannot trust them with an English pamphlet what do we but censure them for a giddy vicious and ungrounded people in such a sick and weak estate of faith and discretion as to be able to take nothing down but through the pipe of a licencer That this is care or love of them we cannot pretend  Those corruptions which it seeks to prevent break in faster at doors which cannot be shut  To prevent men thinking and acting for themselves by restraints on the press is like to the exploits of the gallant man who thought to pound up the crows by shutting his park gate  This obstructing violence meets for the most part with an event utterly opposite to the end which it drives at instead of suppressing books it raises them and invests them with a reputati∣on the punishment of wits enhances their au∣thority saith the viscount St Albans and a forbidden writing is thought to be a certain spark of truth that flies up in the face of them who seek to tread it out  He then adverts to his visit to the famous Gali∣leo whom he found and visited in the inquisition  for not thinking in astronomy with the Francis∣can and Dominican monks  And what event ought more deeply to interest and affect us The very laws of nature were to bend under the rod of a licencer this illustrious astronomer ended his life within the bars of a prison because in seeing the phases of Venus through his newly invented  telescope he pronounced that she shone with borrowed light and from the sun as the center that sun which now inhabits it upon the foundati∣on of mathematical truth which enables us to travel the pathless ocean and to carry our line and rule amongst other worlds which but for Galileo we had never known perhaps even to the reces∣ses of an infinite and immortal God  Milton then in the most eloquent address to the parliament puts the Liberty of the Press on its true and most honourable foundation  Believe it Lords and Commons they who counsel ye to such a suppressing of books do as good as bid you suppress yourselves and I will soon shew how  If it be desired to know the immediate cause of all this free writing and free speaking there cannot be assigned a truer than your own mild and free and humane government it is the liberty lords and commons which your own valourous and happy counsels have purchased us liberty which is the nurse of all great wits this is that which hath rarified and enlightened our spirits like the influence of Heaven this is that which hath enfranchised enlarged and lifted up our apprehensions de∣grees above themselves Ye cannot make us now less able less knowing less eagerly pursu∣ing the truth unless ye first make yourselves that made us so less the lovers less the founders of our true liberty We can grow ignorant again brutish formal and slavish as ye found us but ye then must become that which ye cannot be oppressive arbitrary and tyrannous as they were from whom ye freed us That our hearts are now more capacious our thoughts now more erected to the search and expectation of greatest and exactest things is the issue of your own virtue propagated in us Give me  the liberty to know to utter and to argue freely according to conscience above all liber∣ties  Gentlemen I will now refer you to another au∣thor whose opinion you may think more in point as having lived in our own times and as holding the highest monarchical principles of government I speak of Mr Hume who nevertheless con∣siders that this liberty of the press extends not only to abstract speculation but to keep the public on their guard against all the acts of their govern∣ment  After shewing the advantages of a monarchy to public freedom provided it is duly controlled and watched by the popular part of the constitution lie says  These principles account for the great liberty of the press in these kingdoms beyond what is indulged in any other government It is apprehended that arbitrary power would steal in upon us were we not careful to prevent its progress and were there not an easy method of conveying the alarm from one end of the kingdom to the other  The spirit of the people must frequently be roused in order to curb the ambi∣tion of the court  and the dread of rousing this spirit must be employed to prevent that ambition Nothing is so effectual to this purpose as the liberty of the press by which all the learning wit and genius of the nation may be employed on the side of freedom and every one be ani∣mated to its defence  As long therefore as the republican part of our government can maintain itself against the monarchical it will naturally be careful to keep the press open as of importance to its own preservation  There is another authority cotemporary with the last a splendid speaker in the upper House of Parliament and who held during most of his time high offices under the king I speak of the Earl  of Chesterfield who thus expressed himself in the House of Lords  One of the greatest blessings my lords we enjoy is liberty but every good in this life has its alloy of evillicentiousness is the alloy of liberty it is    Lord Kenyon  Doctor Johnson claims to pluck that feather from Lord Chesterfield's wing he speaks I believe of the eye of the political body  Mr Erskine  Gentlemen I have heard it said that Lord Chesterfield borrowed that which I was just about to state and which his lordship has an∣ticipated  Lord Kenyon  That every speech which did Lord Chesterfield so much honour is supposed to have been written by Doctor Johnson  Mr Erskine  Gentlemen I believe it was so and I am much obliged to his lordship for giving me a far higher authority for my doctrine For though Lord Chesterfield was a man of great ingenuity and wit he was undoubtedly far inferior in learn∣ing and in monarchical opinion to the celebrated writer to whom my lord has now delivered the work by his authority Doctor Johnson then says  One of the greatest blessings we enjoy one of the greatest blessings a people my lords can enjoy is liberty but every good in this life has its alloy of evil Licentiousness is the alloy of liberty it is an ebullition and excrescence it is a speck upon the eye of the political body which I can never touch but with a gentle with trembling hand left I destroy the body lest I injure the eye upon which it is apt to appear  There is such a connection between licen∣tiousness and liberty that it is not easy to cor∣rect the one without dangerously wounding the other it is extremely hard to distinguish the true limit between them like a changeable silk we can easily see there are two different colours but we cannot easily discover where  the one ends or where the other begins  I confess I cannot help agreeing with this learn∣ed author The da  ger of touching the press is the difficulty of marking its limits My learned friend who has just gone out of court has drawn no line and unfolded no principle He has not told us if this book is condemned what book may be written If I may not write against the existence of monarchy and recommend a repub∣lic may I write against any part of the govern∣ment May I say that we should be better without a House of Lords or a House of Commons or a Court of Chancery or any other given part of our establishment Or if as has been hinted a work may become libellous for stating even regal mat∣ter with sarcastic phrase the difficulty becomes the greater and the liberty of the press more im∣possible to define  The same author pursuing the subject and speaking of the fall of Roman liberty says  But this sort of liberty came soon after to be called licentiousness for we are told that Augustus after having established his empire restored or∣der in Rome by restraining licentiousness God forbid we should in this country have order re∣stored or licentiousness restrained at so dear a rate as the people of Rome paid for it to Au∣gustus  Let us consider my lords that arbitrary pow∣er has seldom or never been introduced into any country at once It must be introduced by slow degrees and s is were step by step lest the people should see its approach The bar∣riers and fences of the people's liberty must be plucked one by one and some plausible preten∣ces must be found for removing or hoodwink∣ing one after another those centries who are posted by the constitution of a free country for warning the people of their danger When  these preparatory steps are once made the peo∣ple may then indeed with regret see slavery and arbitrary power making long strides over their land but it will be too late to think of preventing or avoiding the impending ruin  The stage my lords and the press are two of our outsentries if we remove them if we hoodwink them if we throw them in fetters the enemy may surprize us  Gentlemen this subject was still more lately put in the justest and most forcible light by a noble person high in the magistracy and whose mind is not at all turned to the introduction of disorder by improper popular excesses I mean Lord Lough∣borough chief justice of the court of common pleas I believe I can answer for the correctness of my note which I shall follow up with the opinion of another member of the Lord's House of Parlia∣ment the present Earl of Stanhope or rather I shall take Lord Stanhope first as his lordship in∣troduces the subject by adverting to this argument of Lord Loughborough's "If" says his lordship  our boasted liberty of the press were to consist only in the liberty to write in praise of the constitution this is a liberty enjoyed under many arbitrary governments I suppose it would not be deemed quite an unpardonable offence even by the Empress of Russia if any man were to take into his head to write a panegvric upon the Russian form of government Such a liber∣ty as that might therefore properly be termed  the Russian liberty of the press  But  the English li∣berty of the press  is of a very different descripti∣on for by the law of England it is not pro∣hibited to publish speculative works upon the constitution  whether they contain praise or censure  Lord Stanhope's defence of the libel bill  You see therefore as far as the general princi∣ple goes I am supported by the opinion of Lord  Stanhope for otherwise the noble lord has written a libel himself by exciting other people to write  whatever they may think  be it good or evil of the constitution of the country As to the other high authority Lord Loughborough I will read what applies to this subject'Every man' said Lord Loughbourough  may publish at his discretion his opinions concerning forms and systems of go∣vernment  If they be wise and enlightening the world will gain by them if they be weak and absurd they will be laughed at and forgotten and if they be  bona side  they cannot be criminal how∣ever erroneous On the other hand the pur∣pose and the direction may give a different turn to writings whose common construction is harm∣less or even meritorious Suppose men as∣sembled in disturbance of the peace to pull down mills or turnpikes or to do any other mischief and that a mischievous person should disperse among them an excitation to the planned mischief known to be both writer and reader  To your tents O Israel  that publication would be criminal But how criminal not as a libel not as an abstract writing but as an act and the act being the crime  it must be stated as af act ex∣trinfic on the record  for otherwise a court of error could have no jurisdiction but over the natural construction of the writing nor would the defendant have any notice of such matter at the trial without a charge on the record To give the jury cognizance of any matter beyond the construction of the writing the averrment should be in the case as I have instanced that certain persons were as I have described as∣sembled and that the publisher intending to execute these persons so assembled wrote  so and so  Here the crime is complete and consists in an overtact of wickedness evidenced by a writ∣ing  In answer to all these authorities the attorney general may say that if Mr Paine had written his observations with the views of those high per∣sons and under their circumstances he would be protected and acquitted to which I can only an∣swer that no facts or circumstances attending his work are either charged or proved that you have no jurisdiction whatever but over the natural con∣struction of the work before you and that I am therefore brought without a flaw in the deduction to the passages which are the particular subject of complaint  Gentlemen I am come now to observe on the passages selected by the information and with re∣gard to the first I shall dispose of it in a moment  All  hereditary  government is in its nature ty∣ranny An hereditable crown or an heredita∣ble throne or by what other fanciful name such things may be called have no other significant explination than that mankind are heredita∣ble  property  To inherit a government is to  inherit the people  as if they were flocks and herds  And is it to be endured says the attorney gene∣ral that the people of this country are to be told that they are driven like oxen or sheep Certainly not I am of opinion that a more dangerous doctrine cannot be instilled into the people of England But who instills such a doctrine I deny it is instilled by Paine For when he main∣tains that hereditary monarchy inherits a people like flocks and herds it is clear from the context  which is kept out of view  that he is combating the proposition in Mr Burke's book which asserts that the hereditary monarchy of England is fast∣ened upon the people of England by indissoluble compact Mr Paine on the contrary asserts the King of England te be the  magistrate of the people  existing by their consent which is utterly incom∣patable  with their being driven like herds His argument therefore is this and it retorts on his adversary he says such a king as you represent the King of England to be inheriting the people by virtue of conquest or of some compact which having once existed cannot be disolved while the original terms of it are kept  is an inheritance like flocks and herds  But I deny that to be the King of England's title he is  the magistrate of the people  and that title I respect It is to your own imagi∣nary King of England therefore and not to his majesty that your unsounded innuendos apply It is the monarchs of Russia and Prussia and all go∣vernments fastened upon unwilling subjects by hereditary indefeasible titles that are stigmatised by Paine as inheriting the people like flocks The sentence therefore must either be taken in the pure abstract and then it is not only merely spe∣culative but the application of it to our own go∣vernment fails altogether or it must be taken con∣nected with the matter which constitutes the ap∣plication and then it is Mr Burke's King of England and not his majesty whose title is denied  I pass therefore to the next passage which ap∣pears to be an extraordinary selection It is taken at a leap from page to page and breaks in at the words "This convention" The sentence selected stands thus  This convention met at phi∣ladelphia in May of which General Wash∣ington was elected president He was not at that time connected with any of the state govern∣ments or with congress He delivered up his commission when the war ended and since then had lived a private citizen  The convention went deeply into all the sub∣jects and having after a variety of debate and investigation agreed among themselves upon the several parts of a federal constitution the next question was the manner of giving it au∣thority and practice  For this purpose they did not like a cabal of courtiers send for a Dutch stadtholder or a German elector but they referred the whole matter to the sense and interest of the country  The sentence standing thus by itself may ap∣pear to be a mere sarcasm on King William upon those who effected the revolution and upon the revolution itself without any reasoning or de∣duction But when the context and sequel are looked at and compared it will appear to be a se∣rious historical comparison between the revoluti∣on effected in England in and the late one in America when she established her independ¦ence and no man can doubt that his judgment on that comparison was sincere But where is the libel on the constitution For whether King Wil∣liam was brought over here by the sincerest and justest motives of the whole people of England each man acting for himself or through the motives and agencies imputed by the defendant it signi∣fies not one farthing at this time of day to the establishment itself Blackstone warns us not to fix our obedience or affection to the government on the motives of our ancestors or the rectitude of their reasonings but to be satisfied that it is estab∣lished This is safe reasoning and for my own part I shall not be differently affected to the con∣stitution of my country which my own under∣standing approved whether angels or demons had given it birth  Do any of you love the reformation the less be∣cause Henry the Eighth was the author of it Or because lust and poverty and not religion were his motives He had squandered the treasures of his father and he preferred Anne Bullen to his queen these were the causes which produced it What then does that affect the purify of our re∣formed religion undermine its establishment or shake the king's title as prince of the country to  the exclusion of those who held by the religion it had abolished Will the attorney general affirm that I could be convicted of a libel for a whole volume of asperity against Henry the Eighth  rely because he effected the reformation and if not why against King William who effected the revolution Where is the line to be drawn Is one two or three centuries to be statute of limi∣tation But do not our own historians detail this very cabal of courtiers from the records of our own country If you will turn to Hume's histo∣ry volume the eighth page  c c you will find that he states at great length the whole detail of intrigues which paved the way for the revolution and the interested coalition of parties which gave it effect  But what of all this concerning the motives of parties which is recorded by Hume The ques∣tion is  what is the thing brought aboutNot  HOW it was brought about If it stand as Blackstone argues it upon the consent of our ancestors fol∣lowed up by our own no individual can with∣draw his obedience If he dislikes the establish∣ment let him seek elsewhere for another I am not contending for uncontroled  conduct  but for freedom of  opinion  With regard to what has been stated of the  Edwards  and  Henries  and the other princes under which the author can only discover  restrictions on power but nothing of a constitution  sure∣ly my friend is not in earnest when he selects that as a libel  Paine insists that there was no constitution under those princes and that English liberty was ob∣tained from usurped power by the struggles of the people SO SAY I And I think it for the ho∣nour and advantage of the country that it should be known Was there any freedom after the ori∣ginal establishment of the Normans by conquest  Was not the MAGNA CHARTA  rested from John by open force of arms at Runnymead Was it not again reenacted whilst menacing arms were in the hands of the people Were not its stipula∣tions broken through and two and forty times re∣enacted by parliament upon the firm demand of the people in the following reigns I protest it fills me with astonishment to hear these truths brought in question  I was formerly called upon under the discipline of a college to maintain them and was rewarded for being thought to have successfully maintained that our present constitution was by no means a remnant of Saxon liberty nor any other institution of liberty but the pure consequence of the op∣pression of the Norman tenures which spreading the spirit of freedom from one end of the kingdom to the other enabled our brave fathers inch by inch not to reconquer  but for the first time to obtain  those privileges which are the unalienable inheri∣tance of all mankind  But why do we speak of the Edwards and Hen∣ries when Hume himself expressly says notwith∣standing all we have heard today of the antiquity of our constitution that our monarchy was near∣ly absolute till the middle of last century I have his book in court and will read it to you It is his essay on the liberty of the press Vol page  All absolute governments and such in great measure was England till the middle of the last century  notwithstanding the numerous panegyrics on  ANCIENT  English liberty  must very much depend on the administration  This is Hume's opinion the conclusion of a grave historian from all that he finds recorded as the materials for history and shall it be said that Mr Paine is to be punished for writing today what was before written by another who is now a distinguished classic in the language All the  verdicts in the world will not make that palateable to an impartial public or to posterity  The next passage arrained is this P  The attention of the government of England for I rather chuse to call it by this name than the English government appears since its political connection with Germany to have been so com∣pletely engrossed and absorbed by foreign affairs and the means of raising taxes that it seems to exist for no other purposes Domestic concerns are neglected and with respect to regular law there is no such a thing  That the government of this country is in con∣sequence of its connection with the continent and the continental wars which it has occasioned been continually loaded with grievous taxes no man can dispute and I appeal to your justice whether this subject has not been for years toge∣ther the constant topic of unreproved declamati∣on and grumbling  As to what he says with regard to there hardly being such a thing as regular law he speaks in the abstract of the complexity of our system but does not arraign the administration of justice  in its practice  But with regard to criticisms and stric∣tures on the general system▪ it has been echoed over and over again by various authors and even from the pulpits of our country that the law of the land is mainly defective devoid of regularity and precision and overloaded with a variety of expensive and unnecessary forms I have a sermon in court written during the American war by a person of great eloquence and piety part of which I will read to you on this subject in which he looks forward to an exemption from the into∣lerable grievances of our old legal system in the infant establishment of the new world  It may be in the purposes of providence on you western shores to raise the bulwark of a  purer reformation than ever Britain patronized to found a less burthen some more auspicious sta∣ble and incorruptible government than ever Bri∣tain has enjoyed and to establish there a system of law more just and simple in its principles less intricate dubious and dilatory in its pro∣ceedings more mild and equitable in its sancti∣ons more easy and more certain in its execution wherein no man can err through ignorance of what concerns him or want justice through poverty or weakness or escape it by legal arti∣fice or civil privileges or interposing power wherein the rule of conduct shall not be hidden or disguised in the language of principles and customs that died with the barbarism which gave them birth wherein hasty formulas shall not dissipate the reverence that is due to the tribunals and transactions of justice wherein obsolete prescripts shall not pervert nor entan∣gle nor impede the administration of it nor in any instance expose it to derision or to disregard wherein misrepresentation shall have no share in desiding upon right and truth and under which no man shall grow great by the wages of chicanery or thrive by the quarrels that are ruinous to his employers  This is ten times stronger than Mr Paine but who ever thought of prosecuting Mr Cappe  In various other instances you will find defects in our jurisprudence pointed out and lamented and not seldom by persons called upon by their situations to deliver the law in the seat of magis∣tracy therefore the authors  general  observation does not appear to be that species of attack upon the magistracy of the country as to fall within the description of a libel  With respect to the two houses of parliament I believe I shall be able to shew you that the very person who introduced this controversy and who  certainly is considered by those who now admi∣nister the government as a man usefully devoted to maintain the constitution of the country in the present crisis has himself made remarks upon these assemblies that upon comparison you will think more severe than those which are the subject of the attorney general's animadversion The pas∣sage in Mr Paine runs thus  With respect to the  two houses  of which the English Parliament is composed they appear to be effectually influenced into one and as a le∣gislature to have no temper of its own The minister who ever he at any time may be touches it as with an opium wand and it sleeps obedi∣dence  But if we look at the distinct abilities of the two houses the difference will appear so great as to shew the inconsistency of placing power where there can be no certainty of the judgment to use it Wretched as the state of representation is in England it is manhood compared with what is called the House of Lords and so little is this nicknamed house regarded that the peo∣ple scarcely enquire at any time what it is doing It appears also to be most under influence and the furthest removed from the general interest of the nation  The conclusion of the sentence and which was meant by Paine as the evidence of the previous as∣sertion the attorney general has omitted in the information and in his speech it is this  In the debate on engaging in the Russian and Turkish war the majority in the House of Peers in favour of it was upwards of ninety when in the other house which is more than double its numbers the majority was sixty three  The terms however in which Mr Burke speaks of the House of Lords are still more expressive  It is something more than a century ago since  we voted the House of Lords useless They have now voted themselves so and the whole hope of reformation    speaking of the House of Com∣mons  "is cast upon us" This sentiment Mr Burke not only expressed in his place in parlia∣ment where no man can call him to an account but it has been since repeatedly printed amongst his other valuable works And his opinion of BOTH THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT which I am about to read to you was originally published as a pamphlet and applied to the settled abuses of these high assemblies Remember I do not use them as  argumenta ad hominem  or  ad invidiam  against the author for if I did it could be no defence of Mr Paine But I use them as high authority the work  Mr Burke's thoughts on the cause of the present discontent published in  having been the just foundation of substantial and lasting reputation Would to God that any part of it were capable of being denied or doubted  Against the being of parliament I am satisfied no designs have ever been entertained since the revolution Every one must perceive that it is strongly the interest of the court to have some second cause interposed between the ministers and the people The gentlemen of the House of Commons have an interest equally strong in sustaining the part of that intermediate cause However they may hire out the  usufruct  of their voices they never will part with the  fee  and  in∣heritance  Accordingly those who have been of the most known devotion to the will and plea∣sure of a court have at the same time been most forward in asserting an high authority in the House of Commons  When they knew who were to use that authority and how it was to be employed they thought it never could be carried to far  It must be always the wish of an unconstitutional states∣man that an House of Commons  who are entirely  dependant upon him should have every right of the people dependant on their pleasure  FOR IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE FORMS OF A FREE AND THE ENDS OF AN ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT WERE THINGS NOT ALTOGETHER INCOMPA∣TABLE  The power of the crown almost dead and rot∣ten as prerogative has grown up a new with much more strength and far less odium under the name of  influence  An influence which ope∣rates without noise and violence which con∣verts the very antagonist into the instrument of power which contains in itself a perpetual principle of growth and renovation and which the distresses and the pro  perity of the country equally tend to augment w  an admirable sub∣stitute for a prerogative that being only the off∣spring of antiquated prejudices had moulded in its original stamina irresistable principles of de∣cay and dissolution The ignorance of the peo∣ple is a bottom but for a temporary system but the interest of active men in the state is a founda∣tion perpetual and infallible  Mr Burke therefore in page speaking of the same court party says  Parliament was indeed the great object of all these politics the end at which they aimed as well as the INSTRUMENT by which they were to operate  And pursuing the subject in page proceeds as follows  They who will not confirm their conduct to the public good and cannot support it by the prerogative of the crown have adopted a new plan They have totally abandoned the shatter∣ed and oldfashioned fortress of prerogative and made a lodgment in the strong hold of parlia∣ment itself If they have any evil design to which there is no ordinary legal power commen∣surate  they bring it into parliament  There the whole is executed from the beginning to the end And the power of obtaining their object absolute and the safety in the proceeding perfect no rules to confine nor after reckonings to terrify  For parliament can∣not with any propriety punish others for things in which they themselves have been ACCOM∣PLICES  Thus its controul upon the executory power is lost because it is made to partake in every considerable act of government  and imp  achment that great guardian of the purity of the constitution is in danger of being lost even to the idea of it  Until this time the opinion of the people through the power of an assembly still in some sort popular led to the greatest honours and emoluments in the gift of the crown Now the principle is reversed and the favour of the court is the only sure way of obtaining and holding those honours which ought to be IN THE DIS∣POSAL OF THE PEOPLE  Mr Burke in page observes with great truth that the mischiefs he complained of did not at all arise from the monarchy but from the parliament and that it was the duty of the peo∣ple to look to it He says  The distempers of monarchy were the great subjects of apprehen∣sion and redress in the  last century in this  the distempers of parliament  Not the distempers of parliament in this year or the last but in  this century  i e its settled habitual distemper  It is not in parliament alone that the remedy for parliamentary disorders can be completed and hardly indeed can it begin there Until a confidence in government is reestablish∣ed the people ought to be  excited  to a more strict and detailed attention to the conduct of their re∣presentatives Standards for judging more sys∣tematically upon their conduct ought to be set∣tled  in the meetings of counties and corporations and frequent and correct lists of the voters in all important questions ought to be procured  By such means something may be done since it may appear who those are that by an indis∣criminate support of all administrations have to∣tally banished all integrity and confidence out of public proceedings have confounded the best men with the worst and weakened and dis∣solved instead of strengthening and compacting the general frame of government  I wish it was possible to read the whole of this most important volumebut the consequences of these truths contained in it were all eloquently summed up by the author in his speech upon the reform of the household  But what I confess was uppermost with me what I bent the whole course of my mind to was the reduction of that  corrupt influence  which is itself the perennial spring of all prodigality and disorder which load us more than millions of debt which takes away vigour from our arms wisdom from our councils and every shadow of authority and credit from the most venerable parts of our constitution  The same important truths were held out to the whole public upon a still later occasion by the person now at the head of his majesty's councils and so high as it appears in the confidence of the nation  He  not in the abstract like the author be∣fore you but upon the spur of the occasion and in the teeth of what had been just declared in the House of Commons came to and acted upon re∣solutions which are contained in this book  Mr Erskine took up a book  Resolutions pointed to the purification of a parliament dangerously corrupt∣ed into the very state described by Mr Paine Re∣member here too that I impute no censure to Mr Pitt It was the most brilliant passage in his  life and I should have thought his life a better one if he had continued uniform in the support of opinions which it is said he has not changed and which certainly have had nothing to change them But at all events I have a right to make use of the authority of his splended talents and situation not merely to protect the defendant but the public and to resist the precedent that one man may do in England with approbation and glory what shall conduct another man to a pillory or a prison  It was the abuses pointed out by the man before you that led that right honourable gentleman to associate with many others of high rank under the banners of the Duke of Richmond whose name stands at the head of the list and to pass various public resolutions concerning the absolute neces∣sity of purifying the House of Commons and we collect the plan from a preamble entered in the book  Whereas the life liberty and property of every man is or may be affected by the law of the land in which he lives and every man is bound to pay obedience to the same  And whereas by the constitution of this king∣dom the right of making laws is vested in three estates of king lords and commons in parlia∣ment assembled and the consent of all the three said estates comprehending the whole commu∣nity is necessary to make laws to bind the whole community And whereas the House of Com∣mons represents all the commons of the realm and the consent of the House of Commons binds the consent of all the commons of the realm and in all cases on which the legislature is competent to decide  And whereas no man is or can be actually represented who hath not a vote in the election of his representative  And whereas it is the right of every commone  of this realm infants persons of insane mind and criminals incapacitated by law only except∣ed to have a vote in the election of the repre∣sentative who is to give his consent to the mak∣ing of laws by which he is to be bound  And whereas the number of persons who are sufl  red to vote for electing the members of the House of Commons do not at this time a∣mount to one  x  h part of the whole commons of this real  whereby far the greater part of the said commons are  eprived of their right to elect their representatives and the consent of the ma∣jority of the whole community to the passing of laws is given by persons whom they have not delegated for such purposes and the majority of the said community and to which the said ma∣jority have not in fact consented by themselves or by their representatives  And whereas the state of election of members of the House of Commons hath in process of time so grossly deviated from its simple and na∣tural principle of representation and equality and that in several places the members are re∣turned by the property of one man that the smallest boroughs send as many members as the largest counties and that a majority of the re∣presentatives of the whole nation are chosen by a number of votes not exceeding twelve thous∣and  These with many others were published not as abstract speculative writings but within a few days after the House of Commons had declared that no such rights existed and that no alteration was necessary in the representation It was then that they met at the thatchedhouse and publish∣ed their opinions and resolutions to the country at largeWere any of them prosecuted for these proceedings Certainly not for they were legal proceedings But I desire you as men of honour  and truth to compare all this with Mr Paine's ex∣pression of minister's touching parliament with his opiate wand and let equal justice be donethat is all I askLET ALL BE PUNISHED OR NONEdo not let Mr Paine be held out to the contempt of the public upon the score of his observations on parliament while others are enjoying all the sweets which attend a supposed attachment to their country who have said the same things and re∣duced their opinions to practice  But now every man is to be cried down for such opinions I observed that my learned friend sig∣nificantly raised his voice in naming Mr Horne Tooke as if to connect him with Paine or Paine with him This is exactly the same course of jus∣tice for after all he said nothing of Mr Tooke What could he have said but that he was a sub∣scriber with the great names I have read in these proceedings which they have thought fit to desert  Gentlemen let others hold their opinions and change them at their pleasure I shall ever main∣tain it to be the dearest privilege of the people of Great Britain to watch over every thing that af∣fects their good government either in the system or in the practice and that for this purpose the press must be free It has always been so and much evil has been corrected by itIf govern∣ment finds itself annoyed by it let it examine its own conduct and it will find the causelet it amend it and it will find the remedy  Gentlemen I am no friend to sarcasms in the discussion of grave subjects but you must take writers according to the view of the mind at the moment Mr Burke as often as any body indulges ithear his reason in his speech on reform for not taking away the salaries from lords who attend upon the British court "You would" said he  have the court deserted by all the nobility of the kingdom  Sir the most serious mischiefs would follow from such a desertion Kings are naturally lovers of low company they are so elevated above all the rest of mankind that they must look upon all the irsubjects as on a level tbey are rather apt to hate than to love their nobility on account of the occasional resistance to their will which will be made by their virtue their petu∣lance or their pride It must indeed be admit∣ed that many of the nobility are as perfectly willing to act the part of flatterers talebearers parasites pimps and buffoons as any of the lowest and vilest of mankind can possibly be But they are not properly qualified for this ob∣ject of their ambition The want of a regular education and early habits with some lurking remains of their dignity will never permit them to become a match for an Italian eunuch a mountebank a fidler a player or any regular practitioner of that tribe The Roman Empe∣rors almost from the beginning threw them∣selves into such hands and the mischief in∣creased every day till its decline and its final ruin It is therefore of very great importance provided the thing is not overdone to con∣trive such an establishent as must almost whe∣ther a prince will or not bring into daily and hourly offices about his person a great number of his first nobility and it is rather an useful pre∣judice that gives them a pride in such a servi∣tude though they are not much the better for a court a court will be much the better for them I have therefore not attempted to reform any of the offices of honour about the king's person  What is this but saying that a king is an ani∣mal so incurably addicted to low company as ge∣nerally to bring on by it the ruin of nations but nevertheless he is to be kept as a necessary evil and his propensities bridled by surrounding him  with a parcel of miscreants still worse if possible but better than those he would choose for himself This therefore if taken by itself would be a most abominable and libellous sarcasm on kings and no∣bility but look at the whole speech and you ob∣serve a great system of regulation and no man I believe ever doubted Mr Burke's attachment to monarchy To judge therefore of any part of a writing the whole must be read  With the same view I mean to read to you the beginning of Harrington's Oceana but it is im∣possible to name this well known author without exposing to just contempt and ridicule the igno∣rant or profligate misrepresentations which are vomited forth upon the public to bear down eve∣ry man as desperately wicked who in any age or country has countenanced a republic for the mean purpose of prejudging this trial  Is this the way to support the English constitu∣tion Are these the means by which Englishmen are to be taught to cherish it I say if the man upon trial were stained with blood instead of ink if he were covered over with crimes which hu∣man nature would start at the naming of the means employed against him would not be the less dis∣graceful  For this notable purpose then Harrington not above a week ago was handed out to us as a low obscure wretch involved in the murder of the monarch and the destruction of the monarchy and as addressing his despicable works at the shrine of an usurper Yet this very Harrington this low blackguard was descended you may see his pedi∣gree at the Herald'soffice for sixpence from eight dukes three marquisses seventy earls twen∣tyseven viscounts and thirtysix barons sixteen of whom were knights of the garter a descent which I think would save a man from disgrace in any of the circles of Germany But what was he  besidesA BLOODSTAINED RUFFIAN Oh brutal ignorance of the history of the country He was the most affectionate servant of Charles the First from whom he never concealed his opi∣nions for it is observed by Wood that the king greatly aflected his company but when they hap∣pened to talk of a commonwealth he would scarce endure it'I know not' says Toland  which most to commend the king for trusting an ho∣nest man though a republican or Harrington for owning his principles while he served a king  But did his opinions affect his conduct Let his∣tory again answerHe preserved his fidelity to his unhappy prince to the very last after all his fawning courtiers had left him to his enraged subjects He staid with him while a prisoner in the Isle of Wight came up by stealth to follow the fortunes of his monarch and master even hid him∣self in the boot of the coach when he was convey∣ed to Windsor and ending as he began fell into his arms and fainted on the scaffold  After Charles's death the Oceana was written and as if it were written from justice and aff  ction to his memory for it breathes the same noble and spirited regard and asserts that it was not Charles that brought on the destruction of the monarchy but the feeble and illconstituted nature of monar∣chy itself  But the book was a flattery to CromwellOnce more and finally let history decide  It was seized by the usurper as a libel and the way it was recovered was remarkable I men∣tion it to shew that Cromwell was a wise man in himself and knew on what government must stand for their  rt  Harrington waited on his daughter to beg for his book  nd on entering her apartment snatched up her child and r  n awayOn her following him with surprize an terror he turned to her and said  I know what you feel as a mother feel then for me your father has got my child  mean∣ing the oceana The Oceana was afterwards re∣stored on her petition Cromwell answering with the sagacity of a sound politician  Let him have his book if my government is made to stand it has nothing to fear from PAPER SHOT  He said trueNo good government will ever be battered with paper shot Montesquieu says that In a free nation it matters not whe∣ther individuals reason well or ill it is suf∣ficient that they do reason Truth arises from the collision and from hence springs liberty which is a security from the effect of reasoning  The attorney general read extracts from Mr Adams's Answer to this book Let others do like Mr Adams I am not insisiting upon the infalli∣bility of Mr Paine's doctrines if they are errone∣ous let them be answered and truth will spring from the collision  A disposition in a nation to this species of contro∣versy is no proof of sedition or degeneracy but quite the reverse as is mentioned by Milion I omitted to cite the passage with the others who in speaking of this subject rises into that inex∣pressible sublime stile of writing wholly peculiar to himself He was indeed no plagiary from any thing human he looked up for light and expres∣sion as he himself wonderfully describes it by de∣vout prayer to that great being who is the source of all utterance and knowledge and who sendeth out his seraphim with the hallowed fire of his al∣tars to touch and purify the lips of whom he pleases 'When the chearfulness of the people' says this mighty poet  is so sprightly up as that is has not only wherewith to guard well its own freedom and safety but to spare and to bestow upon the solidest and sublimest points of controversy and new inventions it betokens us not degenerated  nor drooping to a fatal decay but casting off the old and wrinkled skin of corruption to outlive these pangs and wax young again entering the glorious ways of truth and prosperous virtue des∣tined to become great and honourable in these latter ages Methinks I see in my mind a noble and puisant nation rousing herself like a strong man after sleep and shaking her invincible locks methinks I see her as an eagle muing her migh∣ty youth and kindling her undazzled eyes at the full midday beam purging and unsealing her long abused sight at the fountain itself of heavenly radiance while the whole noise of timorous and flocking birds with those also that love the twilight flutter about amazed at what she means and in their envious gabble would prognosticate a year of sects and schisms  Gentlemen what Milton only saw in his mighty imagination I see in fact what he expected but what never came to pass I see now fulfilling methinks I see this noble and puissant nation not degenerated and drooping to a fatal decay but casting off the wrinkled skin of corruption to put on again the vigour of her youth  And it is because others as well as myself see this that we have ALL THIS UPROARFrance and its constitution are the mere pretences It is because Britons begin to recollect the inheritance of their own constitution left them by their an∣cestors It is because they are awakened to the corruptions which have fallen upon its most valua∣ble parts that forsooth THE NATION IS IN DAN∣GER OF BEING DESTROYED BY A SINGLE PAMPHLET  Gentlemen I have marked the course of this alarm It began with the renovation of those exer∣tions for the public which the authors of the alarm had themselves originated and deserted and they became louder and louder when they saw these  principles avowed and supported by my admirable and excellent friend Mr Fox the most eminent∣ly honest and enlightened statesman that history brings us acquainted with a man whom to name is to honour but whom in attempting adequately to describe I must fly to Mr Burke my constant refuge when eloquence is necessary a man who to relieve the sufferings of the most distant nation  put to the hazard his ease his security his in∣terest his power even his darling popularity for the benefit of a people whom he had never seen  How much more than for the inhabit∣ants of his native country yet this is the man who has been censured and disavowed in the manner we have lately seen  Gentlemen I have but a few more words to trouble you with I take my leave of you with declaring that all this freedom which I have been endeavouring to assert is no more than the free∣dom which belongs to our inbred constitution I have not asked to acquit Mr Paine upon any new lights or upon any principle but the law which you are sworn to administer My great object has been to inculcate that wisdom and policy which are the parents of the law of Great Britain forbid this jealous eye over her subjects and that on the contrary they cry aloud in the language of the poet employed by Lord Chatham on the memo∣rable subject of America unfortunately without effect  "Be to their faults a little blind  "Be to their virtues very kind  "Let all their thoughts be unconfin'd  "And clap your padlock on their mind"  Engage them by their affections convince their reason and they will be loyal from the only prin∣ciple that can make loyalty sincere vigorous or rational a conviction that it is their truest interest  and that their form of government is for their com∣mon good Constraint is the natural parent of resistance and a pregnant proof that reason is not on the side of those who use it You must all re∣member gentlemen Lucian's pleasant story Ju∣piter and a countryman were walking together conversing with great freedom and familiarity upon the subjects of Heaven and earth The country∣man listened with attention and acquiescence while Jove strove only to convince him but hap∣pening to hint a doubt Jupiter turned hastily round and threatened him with his thunder "Ah ha" says the countryman  now Jupiter I know that you are wrong you are always wrong when when you seek to convince by your thunder  This is the case with meI can reason with the people of England but I cannot fight against the thunder of authority  Gentlemen this is my defence for free opinions  Mr Attorney General arose immediately to re∣ply to Mr Erskine when Mr Campbell the fore∣man of the jury saidMy lord I am authoriz∣ed by the jury here to inform the attorney general that a reply is not necessary for them unless the at∣torney general wishes to make it or your lordship Mr Attorney General sat down and the jury gave in their verdict  GUILTY  A LESSON FOR TYRANTS  Our emperor is a tyrant fear'd and hated  I scarce remember in his reign one day  Pass guiltless o'er his execrable head  He thinks the sun is lost that sees not blood  When none is shed we count it holyday  We who are most in favour cannot call  This hour our own  Dryden  ORIGIN OF THE SWISS REPUBLIC  THE present inhabitants of Swisserland are descended from the ancient Helvetii who were subdued by Julius Caesar They continued long under little better than the nominal dominion of the Houses of Burgundy and Austria till the be∣ginning of the th century when the severity with which they were treated by the Austrian go∣vernors excited a general insurrection and gave rise to what is now called from the ancient name of the country the Helvetic confederacy  This memorable event  thus related Albert Emperor of Germany having in vain attempted to compel all the Switzers to submit to the yoke of the  ouse of Austria these people were so cruelly treated that they entered into a confede∣racy in order to support their ancient rights and privileges Grisler the governor of Uri in or∣der to discover the authors of the conspiracy or∣dered that his hat should be fixed on the top of a pole in the market place of Altof the capital of that province and all those who passed by it were obliged on pain of death to pay obeisance to it as if to the governor himself  William Tell a man of influence in his coun∣try disdaining the mark of vissalage and slavery refused to obey the tyrant's order upon which the latter caused him to be arrested and condemn∣ed him to shoot an apple from the head of his only son who was about five years old Tell answer∣ed that he would rather suffer death himself than risque the safety of his son The tyrant declared that he would hang them both if he did not in∣stantly  obey Thus compelled Tell reluctantly took his bow and from the head of his son who was tied to a tree he shot away the apple to thr admiration of all the spectators The governo perceiving that he had a second arrow demanded what he intended to do with it assuring him at the same time of his full pardon if he would dis∣close the truth'To pierce thy heart' replied Tell 'If I had been so unfortunate as to kill my son'  Grisler basely violating his promise loaded him with chains and made him embark with him on board a vessel that was to cross Lake Uri in or∣der to confine him in a dungeon in one of his cas∣tles but a dreadful tempest arising the governor found that Tell's assistance was necessary to save himself and his crew He therefore ordered his fetters to be taken off and Tell having steered the vessel with safety towards a landing place with which he was well acquainted threw him∣self into the water with his bow and fled to the mountain He there waited in a place that Grisler was obliged to pass and shot him in the heart with his remaining arrow The brave Switzer then hastened to announce the death of the tyrant and their consequent deliverance to the confederates and putting himself at the head of a multitude of his gallant countrymen he took all the fortresses and made the governors prisoners  Such is the celebrated history of the commence∣ment of Swiss liberty which some of the greatest painters have selected as a favourite subject It must not be concealed however that some histo∣rians affect to call in question the circumstance of the apple while others on the contrary have im∣plicitly received it  But not to investigate this subject further all historians are agreed that William Tell was one of the most distinguished authors of this glorious  revolution Grisler was unquestionably killed by him with an arrow He entered into an associati∣on with Werner Stouffacher Walter Furst and Arnold de Melctal whose father had been depri∣ved of his sight by the inhuman monster The plan of this revolution was formed on the th of November The Emperor Albert who would have treated these illustrious men as rebels was prevented by his death The Archduke Leop∣old marched into their country with an army of men  With a force not exceeding the brave Switzers waited for the main body of the Austrian army in the defiles of Morgate More fortunate than Leonidas and his Lacedemonians they put the invaders to flight by rolling down great stones from the tops of the mountains Other bodies of the Austrian army were defeated at the same time by a number of Switzers equally small This vic∣tory having been gained in the Canton of Schweitz the other two Cantons gave this name to the con∣federacy into which by degrees other Cantons en∣tered  Berne which is to Switzerland what Amsterdam is to Holland did not accede to this alliance till the year and it was not till that the small district of Appenzel united to the other can∣tons and completed the number of thirteen No people ever fought longer nor better for their li∣berty They gained more than combats against the Austrians and it is believed will long pre∣serve their independence A country which is not too extensive nor too opulent and where the laws breathe a spirit of mildness must necessarily be free  This revolution in the government produced another in the aspect of the country A barren soil neglected under the dominion of tyrants be∣came at length the scene of cultivation Vine∣yards  were planted on rocky mountains and sa∣vage tracts cleared and tilled by the hands of free∣men became the fertile abode of peace and plenty  The Thirteen Cantons as they now stand in point of precedency are  Zurick  Berne  Lucerne  Ury  Schweitz  Underwalden  Zug  Glacis  Basil  Fribourg  Soleure  Schassnausen and  Appenzel  The contest between the Helvetic states and the House of Austria lasted for no less a period than three hundred and fifty years It ended in the ac∣knowledged independence of the former  The people not turbulent unless seduced or oppressed Slow to resist oppressors Sometimes mild even in their just vengeance Brave in defence of their liber∣ties  From Gordon's discourse on Tacitus  'TIS owing to the arts and industry of Sedu∣cers that the people are sometimes uneasy and discontent under a good government for un∣der such a government they are naturally inclined to be quiet and submissive and it must be very ill usage that will tempt them to throw it off when they are not first notoriously misled There were insurrections against Gustavus Ericson so there were against Queen Elizabeth all animated by the same spirit superstition managed and inflamed by priests But when a just administration is once settled and become familiar to the people and where no violent innovations are attempted they  will not be apt so disturb it nor to wish ill to it They are in truth very slow to resist and often bear a thousand hardships before they return one The Romans long suffered the encroachments insults and tyranny of the last tarquin before they drove him out nor would they have done it so soon but for the rape and tragical fate of Lucretia The Dutch endured the tyranny of Spain till that ty∣ranny grew intolerable When King Philip had wantonly violated his solemn oath destroyed their ancient liberties and laws shed their blood acted like an implacable enemy and used them like dogs it was high time to convince him that they were men and would continue free men in spite of his wicked attempts to enslave them They did so to some purpose to their own immortal glory and establishment in perfect independency to his in∣finite loss and lasting shame  The people of Swisserland groaned long under the heavy yoke of Austria sustained a course of sufferings and indignities too many and too great for human patience So insolent and barbarous were their governors so tame and submissive the governed At last they roused themselves or rather their oppressive governors roused them so as not to be quelled Yet they carried their vengeance no farther than was barely necessary for their fu∣ture security They spilt little or none of the blood of their tyrants and taskmasters the rulers from Austria who had so freely spilled theirs They only conducted these lawless spoilers to the bor∣ders of the country and there dismissed them in safety under an oath never more to return into their territories What could be more slow to re∣sist what more meek in their resistance than that brave and abused people They were indeed so brave and had been so abused as to resolve never more to submit to the imperial power Thence forth they asserted their native freedom and as∣serted  it with amazing valour With handfuls of men they overthrew mighty hosts and could ne∣ver be conquered by all the neighbouring powers Their exploits against the imperial armies against those of Lewis the Eleventh then Dauphin against Charles the bold Duke of Burgundy are scarce credible Three hundred and fifty Swiss routed at one time eight thousand Austrians some say sixteen thousand An hundred and thirteen van∣quished the archduke Leopald's army of twenty thousand and killed a great number an hundred and sixteen beat another army of near twenty thou∣sand and slew him  It was no small provocation no casual mistakes or random sallies of passion in their rulers that drove the Dutch and Swiss to expel theirs No the oppression the acts of violence were general constant deliberate and encreasing For such is the nature of men in power that they will rather commit two errors than retract one as Lord Cla∣rendon justly observes Sometimes they will com∣mit a second to shew that they are not ashamed of the first but resolved to defy resentment to de∣clare their contempt of the people and how much they are above fear and amendment Some of them have delighted to heighten cruelty by mirth and derision like him in Swisserland who having long insulted and abused the poor people and still thinking their servitude imperfect set up his cap in the market place and obliged all that passed by to pay it reverence nay to punish one for failing in duty to that cap he caused him to place an ap∣ple upon his son's head and at such a distance to cleave it with an arrow Was there not cause was it not high time to exterminate such instruments of cruelty  An Epistle from a Swiss Officer to his Friend at Rome  From Dodsley's Poems  FROM horrid mountains ever hid in snow  And barren lands and dreary plains below  To you dear sir my best regards I send  The weakest reasoner as the truest friend  Your arguments that vainly strive to please  Your arts your country and your palaces  What signs of Roman grandeur yet remain  Much you have said and much have said in vain  Fine pageants these for slaves to please the eye  And put the neatest dress on misery  Bred up to slav'ry and dissembled pain  Unhappy man you trifle with your chain  But should your friend with your desires comply  And sell himself to Rome and slavery  He could not wear his trammels with that art  Or hide the noble anquish of his heart  You'd soon repent the liv'ry that you gave  For trust me I should make an awkward slave  Falsely you blame our barren rocks and plains  Happy in freedom and laborious swains  Our Peasants chearful to the field repair  And can enjoy the labours of the year  Whilst yours beneath some tree with mournful eyes  Sees for his haughty lord his harvest rise  Then silent sighs but stops his slavish breath  He silent sighs for should he speak 'tis death  Hence from our field the lazy grain we call  Too much for want for luxury too small  Whilst all compania's rich inviting soil  Scarce knows the plowshare or the reaper's toil  In arms we breed our youth To dart from far  And aim aright the thunder of the war  To whirl the faulchion and direct the blow  To ward the stroke or bear upon the foe  Early in hardships thro' the woods they fly  Nor feel the piercing frost or wintry sky  Some prowling wolf or foamy boar to meet  And stretch the panting savage at their feet  Inur'd by this they seek a nobler war  And shew an honest pride in ev'ry scar  With joy the danger and the blood partake  Whilst ev'ry wound is for their country's sake  But you soft warriers forc'd into the field  Dr faintly strike or impotently yield  For well this universal truth you know  Who fights for tyrants is his country's foe  I envy not your arts the Roman schools  Improv'd perhaps but to enslave your souls  May you to stone or nerves or beauty give  And teach the soft'ning marble how to live  May you the passions in your colours trace  And work up ev'ry piece with ev'ry grace  In airs and attitudes be wond'rous wise  And know the arts to please or to surprize  In music's softest sounds consume the day  Sounds that would melt the warrior's soul away  Vain efforts these an honest fame to raise  Your painters and your eunuchs be your praise  Grant us more real goods you heav'nly powers  Virtue and arms and liberty be ours  Weak are your offers to the free and brave  No bribe can purchase me to be your slave  Hear me ye rocks ye mountains and ye plains  The happy bounds of brave Helvetian swains  In thee my country will I fix my seat  Nor envy the poor wretch that would be great  My life and arms I dedicate to thee  For know it is my int'rest to be free  BEWARE OF ORATORS  From Littleton  WHEN once it becomes a fashion to advance men to dignity and power not for the good  councils that they give but for an agreeable manner of recommending bad ones it is impossible that a government so administered can long subsist Is any thing complained of as amissinstead of re∣dress they give you an oration Have you com∣posed a good needful lawin exchange for that you receive an oration Has your natural reason determined you upon any pointup gets an ora∣tor and so  confounds  you that you are no longer able to reason at all Is any measure to be  obstructed  or wrong one to be advancedthere is an orator always ready and it is most  charmingly  performed to the delight of all the hearers  THE AMERICANS HAPPY WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF  Royal Proclamations  A new Song  By  W D Grant  TUNE  "Beneath a Cyphress Grove"  AMERICA behold O happy happy cl  me  Her triumphs will be told until the end of time  There liberty is law  And joy o'erspreads each cheek  No more 'tis  "vive le roi"  But "  vive la  REPUBLIQUE  Beneath fair freedom's tree her sons obtain repose  Blest fruits of liberty which  despots  WOULD oppose  Hereditary fools  Let  fools  and  rogues  obey  For none o'er freemen rules  But LOVE and LIBERTY  No  titled insolence  of virtue makes a prey  No  royal impotence  usurps the  nation's  sway  There liberty is law  And joy o'erspreads each cheek  No more 'tis  "vive le roi"  But "  vive la  REPUBLIQUE"  SONNET TO FREEDOM  BY RICHARD LEE  Author of the Poems entitled  "Flowers from Sharon"  CELESTIAL FREEDOM hail whose liberal hand  The great CREATOR with his bounty fills  To scatter plenty thro' the favour'd land  That knows thy worth and courts thy lovely smiles  Where thou art absent haggard mis'ry dwells  And pining want hangs down her wither'd head  Industry faints slow indolence prevails  And commerce folds her languid hands half dead  Come then dear FREEDOM come reside with me  And I shall sing tho' in a lowly cot  P  oud  sceptr'd tyrants  will unenvied be  Whilst I am blest with this superior lot  Content and cheerful I will pass my days  And grateful give the GOD OF
