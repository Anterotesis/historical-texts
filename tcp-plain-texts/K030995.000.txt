dele  not  AN APPENDIX TO THE REPRESENTATION c  SINCE the Publication of my Book on  the Injustice and dangerous Ten∣dency of Tolerating Slavery in England  several unforeseen circumstances ha  e obli∣ged me to consider that subject more strictly in order to obviate the insinuations of some interested Persons who still en∣deavour to inculcate and maintain even in this Island the ungenerous West Indian Notions concerning property in Slaves  Upon these dangerous princip  several violent Outrages have lately been commit∣ted  for the recovery of such pretended property and several Negroes have been knocked down and kidnapped by Ruffians hired for that purpose and have been hur∣ried on Ship Board in order to be transpor∣ted to the West Indies in open Contempt of the English Laws and of the Habeas Corpus Act in particular which denounces heavy Penalties against those who attempt to transport  any Person whatever  from this Kingdom against their Will for I have shewn in my former Treatise in Pages to that Negroes and all other Aliens are the  King's Subjects  when resiant in this Kingdom and that they are entitled to the Protection of the English Laws in ge∣neral and of the Habeas Corpus Act in particular The same Arguments are fur∣ther inforced in Pages to  In Pages to of the same Book will be found a full Answer to such Argu∣ments as had then been offered concerning  any right which the Master may have ac∣quired to the perpetual service of a Man  and in Pages and it is I hope demonstrated that the Service of  a Slave  cannot justly be compared to the Service of  an Apprentice  and that  a Contract  cannot be  implied  in such a Case as some learned Men have insinuated  In the fourth and last Part of the said Tract the Doctrines of  Villenage  are shewn to be  obsolete  so that the least Claim of  perpetual Service  cannot be justified thereby  These References to my former Work are inserted here partly to avoid a recapi∣tulation of these necessary points and partly that those who have any concern at present in such matters may thereby be enabled to consider and examine these several Heads without the trouble of reading the whole Book which is not so compendious as the Author could wish it having been wrote at several different Periods as occasion offer∣ed and new Arguments were opposed during the time that an Action which was shamefully prolonged depended against the Author and one of his Brothers for having  accidentally not officiously assisted a poor Negro Servant who was kidnapped and con∣fined in the Poultry Compter without a Warrant and there sold to a WestIndia Planter to be transported to Jamaica  It has already been proved in the places before referred to that  no right whatever  can be acquired to  the perpetual Service of a Man  without a  Contract  and that such a  Contract  cannot be  implied  unless the free Consent of both Parties is  implied  likewise and clearly proved Nevertheless as some sordid and tenacious Contenders for this kind of imaginary Property are still so in∣considerate as to risque all the Penalties of a  Premunire  besides heavy Fines by ven∣turing to seize and carry away by force their quondam Slaves I am willing for the pre∣sent to admit their  Plea of Private Property  merely that I may examine the Weight of it and balance it with the Negroes  Pro∣perty in his own Person  which in a Land of Justice doth equally demand some share of our Consideration  The Authors and Abettors of the scan∣dalous and Inhuman Outrages of which I complain cannot possibly ground their De∣fence on any other Point whatsoever than this single Plea  of private Property  and the necessary obligation of the Courts of Justice to  secure to every Man his own  Now if a Negro Man or any other human Being whatever is considered as  property  in this Country he falls under the Head of  Chat∣tels  and must necessarily so far I mean as the Master's right ought to be considered be ranked under that denomination  Now A CHATTEL is  "res estimabilis"  a thing to be valued a thing merely of a  pecuniary  consideration and the Slaveholder accordingly rates his supposed Property in  a Man  at  a base price  not more upon an average than the value of  a good Horse  viz  l    l  or  l to the disgrace of hu∣man nature  whereas on the other hand the Negro though considered as  a Chattel  with respect to the Master's claim yet be∣ing himself also  a Man  has certainly a  superior right and title to  his own Person  a claim  of natural Property  in himself which is  inestimable  far above all  pecuniary  consi∣deration for with respect to  his side of the question  THE HUMAN BODY IS ABOVE ALL PRICE  Corpus humanum non recipit aesti∣mationem  Principia Legis Aequitati' p  Surely  his Liberty  to him is  inestimable  at least the  English  Law presumes that it is so  LIBERTAS EST RES INEST∣IMABILIS  Jenk Cent  Now let the idea of the CHATTEL even at the highest price it will bear be weighed and compared with the subject of the last men∣tioned maxim and  let Justice hold the scale  Shall we doubt whether the  Estimable  claim or  the Inestimable  claim is to be pre∣ferred  The Law regards  the Person  above his  Possessions    Life  and  Liberty most    Freehold  and  Inheritance above Chattels  c  Ibid p  so that  Chattels  we find are but of a very inferior consideration being  ranked only in the third degree  Law favoureth Life Liberty  and  Dower  and cannot therefore give the preference to the Master's mere  mercenary  claim of  property  without a manifest con∣tradiction to itself  And the Law abhors Falshood Variance Contrariety  c    Lex Angliae non patitur  ABSURDUM  Cook      Lex rejicit  PUGNANTIA incongrua  Jenk Cent    It is true indeed that the Law in this case may seem to suffer or permit a wrong by the Master's losing his supposed right and property but if we consider that the admitting  such a Property  would be a want of  Mercy  in the Law nay even an act  of Cruelty  which the Law abhors to∣wards those persons who have  a superior  because  a natural interest  in the determina∣tion of this question it must appear to de∣monstration that the Law  doth no wrong  when it rejects the  lesser  claim of  estimable  property in favour of that  natural interest  which is  inestimable  And therefore how∣soever the imaginary proprietor may think  himself aggrieved yet the law is vindi∣cated herein when we consider that every claim  of Property  is absolutely  unjust in itself  and must necessarily be set aside through  the mercy  of the Law if it interferes or is in∣consistent with that  natural  and  equitable  claim to  personal security  which the law of this kingdom hath  always favoured  for  "the Law of England is a Law of Mercy"  LEX ANGLIAE EST LEX MISERICORDIAE  Inst    so that each Slaveholder must still be obliged to allow  that the Law  even in this unavoidable decision against himself  doth injury to no man    Lex nemini operatur iniquum    nemini facit injuriam  Let the Slaveholder remember also that his being thus deprived of his imaginary Property cannot be considered otherwise let him make the most of it than merely as  a private loss  whereas if such an  unna∣tural right  be admitted without due consi∣deration of the superior  Personal Right  of the Negro a worse Vassalage than the An∣cient  Villenage  The Antient Villenage was long since extinguished through the virtue and continual opposition of the King's Courts in favour of the  Common Law  which I have elsewhere shewn so that such another  unjust Ty∣ranny  cannot possibly be admitted without an apparent violation of the  Common Law  would in time be introduced into this free Christian Country by which  the Publick  would  be materially injured  as well  in Honour  as  in Morals  and  National Safety  therefore  the Law will rather endure  a particular mischief  as the loss of private  property than a general incon∣venience  Lex citius tollerare vult  PRI∣VATUM DAMNUM  quam  PUBLICUM MALUM Co  Lit    Thus stands the Common Law with re∣spect to the point in question and it is not I apprehend in the least altered by Sta∣tute Law so that unless the Advocates for Slavery can prove that it is altered we may safely conclude with the following maxim that  whatever was at Common Law ana is not taken away by Statute remaineth still  Co Lit  I flatter myself that no Gentleman of the Law will attempt to contradict or set aside the established Maxims which are here quoted because such a behaviour would necessarily draw upon them that just censure and contempt which the learned Author  Christopher Seyniarmayne or St German who died in  of the  Doctor and Student  expres∣ses in his VIIIth  See the English Translation printed in page  Chapter against all Lawyers  without exception to dignity  that presume to contradict approved maxims  The Fourth Ground of the Law of  Eng∣land  says he standeth in divers princi∣ples that be called  in the Law Maxims  the which have been always taken for Law SEMPER HABITA ET TENTA SUNT PRO LEGE in this Realm  so that it is not lawful for any that is learned to deny them  for every one of those  Max∣ims  is sufficient authority to himself  Thus far the Translator but we may ga∣ther from the words of the excellent Au∣thor  himself  See the Latin Edition in mo printed in page  that Men who deny these Maxims  are no longer worthy to be talked with  for he adds  in tanto quod cum ne∣gantibus ea  viz Maxima  non est ulterius arguendum  Quartum fundamentum Legis Angliae stat in di∣versis principiis quae a peritis Legis Angliae MAXIMA vocantur quae SEMPER HABITA ET TENTA SUNT PRO LEGE in hoc Regno Angliae quibus NON EST LICITUM ALICUI LEGIS PERITO CONTRADICERE quia  unumquodque maximorum illorum  est sibi ipsi fides in tanto quod CUM NEGANTIBUS EA NON EST UL∣TERIUS ARGUENDUM    A more modern but not less respectable Author has furnished us with a Maxim nearly to the same effect  viz  Those that forego or set aside the Law of the Land deservedly incur from thence a perpetual stain of Infamy    Legem terrae amittentes perpetuam infamiae notam inde merito incurrunt  Sir Ed Cook IIId Inst  Thus the  Plea of private property in the Persons of Men  must necessarily fall to the  Ground when it is measured by the Maxims of the Common Law  I have not designedly done any injustice to this Plea and tho' I may perhaps have treated my subject injudiciously and not according to Method yet I defy the most interested advocate for Slavery to give more real weight or value to such kind of pro∣perty than what I have already stated if at the same time the Learned Judge Black∣stone's arguments concerning the three Origins of Slavery be duly considered  I have quoted these Arguments at length in my former Tract from page to but shall nevertheless repeat them here and pledge them as unanswerable by the most able Casuist or even by the Learned Author himself were he to undertake it But this I speak only comparatively refer∣ring to his great  abilities  not his  will  for though I have been obliged to guard against some doubtful expressions in other part of his Works See my former Tract pages to yet I have too good an opinion of  that worthy Gentleman to conceive that he will ever entertain any real inclination for so ungenerous a task  The three origins of the right of Sla∣very says he assigned by Justinian are all of them built upon false foundations As first Slavery is held to arise  "jure gentium"  from a state of captivity in war whence Slaves are called  mancipia quasi manu capti  The conqueror say the Civilians had a right to the life of his captive and having spared that has a right to deal with him as he pleases But it is untrue position when taken generally that by the law of nature or nations a man may kill his ene∣my he has only a right to kill him in particular cases in cases of absolute necessity for selfdefence and it is plain this absolute necessity did not subsist since the victor did not actually kill him but made him prisoner War is itself justifiable only on principles  of selfpreservation and therefore it gives no other right over prisoners but merely to disable them from doing harm to us by confining their persons much less can it give a right to kill torture abuse plunder or even to enslave an enemy when the war is over Since there∣fore the right of  making  Slaves by capti∣vity depends on a supposed right of slaughter that foundation failing the consequence drawn from it must fail like∣wise But secondly it is said that Sla∣very may begin  "jure civili"  when one man sells himself to another This if only meant of contracts to serve or work for another is very just but when ap∣plied to strict Slavery in the sense of the laws of old Rome or modern Barbary is also impossible Every sale implies a price a  quid pro quo  an equivalent given to the seller in lieu of what he transfers to the buyer but what equivalent can be given for life and liberty both of which in absolute Slavery are held to  be in the master's disposalHis pro∣perty also the very price he seems to receive devolves  ipso facto  to his master the instant he becomes his Slave In this case therefore the buyer gives nothing and the seller receives nothing of what validity then can a sale be which destroys the very principles upon which all sales are foundedLastly we are told that besides these two ways by which Slaves  "fiunt"  or are acquired they may also be hereditary  servi naj∣cunter"  the children of acquired Slaves are  jure naturae  by a negative kind of birthright Slaves also But this being built on the two former rights must fall together with them If nei∣ther captivity nor the sale of one's self can by THE LAW OF NATURE AND REASON reduce the parent to Slavery much less can they reduce the offspring  Upon these principles  THE LAW OF ENG∣LAND  abhors and will not endure the exist∣ence of Slavery within this nation  so that  when an attempt was made to introduce it▪  by statute Edward VI c which ordained that all idle vagabonds should be made Slaves and fed upon bread water or small drink and refuse meat should wear a ring of iron round their necks arms or legs and should be compelled by beating chaining or otherwise to perform the work assigned them were it never so vile  the spirit of the nation could not brook this condition▪  even in the most abandoned rogues and therefore this statute was repealed in two years afterwards  Coms Vol p    Thus it is clear that there can be no claim of right to  the perpetual Service of a man  which is not ORIGINALLY FOUNDED EITHER IN RAPINE THEFT OR NOTORI∣OUS INJUSTICE  For it must be obvious to every person who is not blinded by the desire of gain  says the author of a Short Account of the Slave Trade c which I caused to be reprinted in p  that the Right by which these  men hold the Negroes in Bondage is no other than what is derived from those who stole them who having no other Title but that which Robbers have over their Prey could not convey any better to the purchaser and that therefore to continue to hold them in Bondage for wordly Advantage by no other right than that which those guilty men give them is consenting to and partaking of their Guilt  Therefore when a Notorious Outrage and Breach of the Peace is committed under the pretence of any such  groundless claim of service  the Magistrate who neglects to  re∣lieve  the person oppress'd and  to punish  the Offenders is certainly a partaker of their Guilt and no upright and conscientious Judge who does not set up his  own will above the laws of the Land  can possibly entertain any  doubt in his mind  about the punishment of such Offenders for when the Laws of the Land and especially the Habeas Corpus Act are expressly and  clearly  on one Side of the Question  without the least exception whatever concerning any difference or distinction of Persons and when the  only plea  on the  other side of the Question  is absolutely without Foundation either in Natural Equity or the established Law and Customs of this Country what room can there be for  doubt  and how would a Judge be able to justify an Arrest of Judgment in such a case  Every Judge is or ought to be sworn that  he will minister Justice indifferently  or without respect of Persons  to all Men    Se justitiam ministraturum indifferenter omnibus hominibus  Fortescue de Laudibus Leg Angliae Chap And therefore if the Laws and Established Cus∣toms of the land with respect to the pre∣sent Question make  no distinction of Persons  whether Bond or Free White or Black neither can a Judge without risquing  the guilt of Perjury  I have proved in Page of my for∣mer Tract  that the Laws of England  in the late Reign were esteemed obnox∣ious to any involuntary Bondage without a just cause and to all  private jurisdictions whatsoever  so that  an extension of  THE INFLUENCE  See the Act of Geo II intituled an Act for taking away and abolishing the heretable jurisdictions in that part of Great Britain called Scotland c  BENEFIT AND PROTEC∣TION  of these laws  was considered as a relief to our Fellow Subjects in Scotland from all  private  oppression I mean the late pernicious  Vassalage  of Scotland the extinction of which has happily produced the present flourishing State of Arts Trade and Manufactories amongst our Brethren in that part of the Island  But as the claim of  private property in the persons of men  is the very root and foundation of the worst kind of  Vassalage  I must observe that if any Judge should hereafter venture to suspend the execution of the English Laws in consideration of  any such kind of pre∣tensions whatever  he might be said to stab the constitutional freedom of two Great and  ancient Kingdoms at one blow For how should our fellow subjects at the other end of the Island be able to trust in the parlia∣mentary Promise of the  Influence Benefit and Protection of the King's Laws  to be  extended  as far as Scotland if the said Laws were really liable to be rendered  ineffectual  even in England by a mere  groundless doubt  of one single Judge  A  Doubt  is certainly a very insuffi∣cient excuse for an  arrest of Judgment  in any case whatever unless  "strong and probable Grounds"  are alledged to justify it but a  groundless doubt  upon the present question would be more parti∣cularly criminal because it would pro∣bably tend to the introduction of the  diabolical  See a Note in my former Tract page where this hard Epithet is proved  Tyranny and Injustice of our West Indian Colonies whereby  human Nature is vilifyed and degraded to the Rank and level of brute Beasts  for not only the grossest op∣pression of our  fellow man  but even  murder  Ibid page and  is there tolerated and  Marriage  exclu∣ded  Ibid page  as I have shewn in the notes to my former work  Ibid page to The last of these pages is now earnestly recommended by the Author to the se∣rious perusal of all persons who have any influence in Government if they sincerely wish prosperity to England  Whatever tends to the same point viz the  degradation of human nature  and the in∣troduction of that consummate wickedness which must of course prevail  wherever Slavery is tolerated  does certainly promote the Work and Service of the  Grand Enemy of Mankind  and consequently ought to be estemed highly offensive to Almighty God  Some Persons may perhaps alledge in vindication of the  supposed doubt  above men∣tioned that the Legislature has at diffe∣rent times given encouragement to the  African Slave Trade  however detestable and  pernicious to mankind  it may be esteemed and that the same ought to be accounted  an acknowledgment that  Property in Slaves  is in some degree  lawful  Such Arguments and Insinuations I have frequently heard but let the Advocates for Sla∣very make the most of them they can yet shall they not be able to avail themselves of any such strained consequential Doctrines for suppose that the Legislature should un∣warily happen to  do wrong  in any parti∣cular point whatsoever and that any one of their Subjects in a judicial character should instead of giving them warning of  the evil  be ready to go before them in it and should even shew himself prone to carry the  mis∣chief  to a much higher pitch than the  Le∣gislature  ever conceived or intended by en∣deavouring to render ineffectually one of their most solemn acts relating in some re∣spect to the same point which we will suppose to have remained  unrepealed  and  in full force  and which might therefore have been used as a just and honest expedient to save  the honour  of the  Legislature  and cor∣rect the inadvertent  evil  Such a neglect  and contempt of a  positive and established statute  added to a disregard of  natural as well as national Justice  ought to be esteemed as a sufficient reason for condemning such a man as  a most undutiful subject and dangerous Politician  But to carry the Argument still further let us suppose what I trust will never come to pass that even the  Legislature itself  should become so miserably degenerate as to repeal or annul the Habeas Corpus Act and adopt instead of it the most horrid and diaboli∣cal of the West Indian Laws yet even in this case the natural  unlawfulness  and wickedness of such principles as those laws contain would  still remain  for  No Legis∣lature on Earth which is the supreme power in every Civil Society can alter the Nature of things or make that to be lawful which is contrary to the Law of God the supreme Legislator and Go∣vernor of the World Mischief may be framed and established by a Law but  if it be it is mischief still as much so as it was before it was established tho' its being so may make Men insensible of their Guilt or bold and fearless in the Perpetration of it for too many among Christians are contrary to  Christ  's Ex∣hortation more influenced by the Fear of Man than by the Fear of GodIt is really a serious Subject and I own it raises a serious concern in my Mind that such Barbarity should be suffered in Christian Nations It is enough to make a Man's Heart ach unless he has not lost all Love and Regard to his Kind to think that so many Thousands of the Hu∣man Race should be sacrificed every year to that greedy voracious God  Mammon  Short Account of the Slave Trade p    The Number of Negro Slaves bought  in one Year only  viz on the Coast of Africa from Cape Blanco to Rio Longo amounted to Persons according to a particular state of that Trade inserted in the Gazetteer of the th of July  These miserable creatures it is said  were bought by Barter for European and Indian Goods chiefly at    l Sterling each  Now it is dreadful to consider  what multitudes of men  must have been  killed  merely in the attempt to take so many wret∣ched Captives for sale and again  what multitudes  out of so large a number would  die  as usual in their passage to the West Indies and America either of Grief and despair or by being inhumanly stifled in the Holds of Ships besides the large proportion nearly one half that would  die  of the seasoning as it is called after their arrival in the plantations and lastly that all the remainder of  this vast multitude of    miserable human beings  will probably be  worn out  by hard service and oppression in the space of about years or less ac∣cording to the average rate of some calcula∣tions that have been published These consi∣derations I say must needs inspire us with indignation and horror even though the evil at present is at a considerable distance from  us But if the advocates for  the unnatural and unlawful claims  against which I contend should receive such encouragement as to  confirm their pretensions  the same must inevitably introduce by degrees a Tolera∣tion of the West India Slavery with all its  direful consequences  into this Kingdom which added to the manifold corruptions and deprav  ties into which this Kingdom has already unhappily fallen will certainly cause our measure of Iniquity to over∣flow and in all probability draw down upon us some dreadful and speedy  national  calamity  The Irish at the first Council of Armagh in the Reign of K Henry the II were persuaded and they had but too much cause for it that the miseries with which their Island was then afflicted were the  effect of God's Wrath  for their having tolerated Slavery amongst them See Rapin Vol p  besides that severe
