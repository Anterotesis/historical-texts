 MEMOIRS OF Mr Charles Churchill  Price Half a Crown Bound  GENUINE MEMOIRS OF Mr Charles Churchill WITH AN Account of and Observations on HIS WRITINGS TOGETHER WITH Some ORIGINAL LETTERS that passed between him and the Author  Nothing extenuate  Nor set down aught in malice  * * * * * * * * * *  He was a man take him for all in all  I ne'er shall look upon his like again  SHAKESPEAR  LONDON Printed for J PRIDDEN in FleetStreet MDCCLXV  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL TEMPLE  MY LORD  TO dedicate a treatise on tactics to a bishop or a discourse on religion to a general would be a great impropriety but I can by no means think it one to inscribe the Memoirs of Mr Churchill to the earl Temple  Indeed my lord I know not to whom I could with greater propriety  address the following sheets than to your lordship Your lordship or I greatly mistake had a great respect for Mr Churchill admired his abilities and loved his integrity  I shall not pretend in this Dedication to draw the character of lord Temple however prevalent the practice is with dedicators with respect to their patrons I shall not entreat lord Temple to patronise my work it must patronise itself If it be well written it will be well received if a mere unsuccessful effort to draw a just portrait of my friend even my lord Temple's patronage great as it is will be insufficient to screen it from its deserved censure  Yet my lord though I decline the arduous pleasing work of drawing your lordship's character give me leave to admire that unshaken spirit of independence that glorious greatness of soul which shines through every action of your lordship's life adds a lustre to your high rank and ennobles your virtues Not to mention one's sensibility of it would be criminal not to own it would be ingratitude  England owes much to your lordship The cause the great and glorious cause of liberty has in your lordship found a powerful patron and an able advocate  It is a fortunate circumstance when a statesman has a strength of genius and a high reach of thought but it is still more so when that reach of thought and strength of genius is accompanied with invincible integrity and a Temple's virtues  Patriotism like wit is much talked of claimed by many possessed by few To form a patriot great abilities alone will not succeed There must be also a true  amor patriae  a generous disregard of private interest if set in competition with the public good and a Temple's and a Pitt's unconquered freedom of soul incorruptible probity of mind  Your lordship's known zeal for the honour of religion must not pass unnoticed The weakening of moral obligations is of the utmost danger to a state While religion maintains its influence the interests of society are upheld when that great cement of society is weakened anarchy and confusion soon succeed  A friend to religion is a friend to his country It is a singular happiness that in these degenerate days when infidelity passes for judgment and obscenity for wit genuine and true piety the fair child of religion points out a Temple as her advocate and as her friend  As a lover of liberty in the real sense of the word your lordship stands eminently distinguishedThe enormous faith of many made for one has been long and justly exploded yet notwithstanding the glaring absurdity of such a soulenslaving tenet fools and knaves have not been wanting in these times to preach up this doctrine and recommend this absurdity the greatest affront sure that ever was offered to the commonsense of mankind  A constitutional defender of the laws has always appeared in the person of the earl Temple The prerogatives of the sovereign and the freedom of the subjects are not so incompatible as some dreamers imagine The greatest strength a  prince can possess the most homefelt blessing he can possibly know is the love of his people This doctrine the earl Temple has ever been ready to inculcate has always been strenuous to defend  Of all the virtues that do honour to mankind I know of none more amiable or more beneficial than a generous disinterested friendship built on the firm basis of honour and judgment None but the good can possess this virtue A titled wretch or wealthy miscreant is a stranger to those delicate sensations that spring from so pure a source That my lord Temple may be pointed out as an eminent example of generous and disinterested friendship  every one knows and every one confesses  Example is always more powerful than precept To look up therefore to my lord Temple as a statesman a patriot and a friend will have greater effect than the description of many statesmen patriots and friends in the writings of the learned world  But whilst your lordship stands so eminently conspicuous for your abilities and integrity in public life your amiable deportment in private life must not be forgot Easy of access your lordship is enabled to form a true estimate of things Chearful free and affable your  lordship gives pleasure wherever you come and when you retire from social converse with your friends they meet a loss not easily to be repaired but by your lordship  My lord I address not the statesman I address not the nobleman I address not the man of fortune I address the man  If as Mr Pope says an honest man is the noblest work of the Almighty your lordship has abundant reason to bless the Father of all good gifts for his enduing you with such amiable qualities as render you the delight of mankind and an ornament to your country Your gardens at Stow and the sculptures of your temple shall  perish when your virtues shall be read and admired by future ages in the productions of the historian or the efforts of the muse  Yet my lord I speak it with English sincerity and English liberty you are a man and as such have faults but I believe it would puzzle the most discerning to point them out Indeed it is no small proof of your lordship's wisdom that while every one admires your virtues you have so effectually concealed your foibles which surely as a man you must have that we cannot so much as guess at them for eagleeyed scandal itself has never thrown the least innuendo or smallest insinuation against your character  For me my lord I am thrown at too great a distance from your lordship to pretend to draw your portrait with a masterly hand But however deficient I may be in point of drapery the resemblance is striking for I appeal to your lordship's enemies if enemies you have whether I have drawn one feature your lordship does not possess or attributed one excellence your lordship is not endued with  My lord I seek no applause and claim no honour from the following sheets My intention has been to give a faithful history as nearly as I could of our late patriot bard to rescue his character from the censures of the malevolent and still more cruel fate from the indiscriminate  and indiscreet applauses of his friends  That your lordship may long remain with us as the firm friend of liberty and your country and when called from this terrestrial world that you may enjoy a conspicuous place in the mansions of eternal bliss is the sincere wish and fervent prayer of  MY LORD  Your Lordship's most obedient and very humble servant THE AUTHOR  London  Jan  MEMOIRS OF THE LIFE OF THE LATE Mr Charles Churchill  CHAP I  A Sketch of Mr Churchill's character  THOSE sons of genius and judgment who have made themselves remarkable by the exertion of their abilities when departed from this sublunary world  seem to claim the remembrance of their survivors as a debt and gratitude suggests to us it would be inhuman as well as impolitic to consign their memories to oblivion at the same time that we commit their clay to the grave  Anecdotes concerning the good and great throw a light on many passages in their writings which without them would be obscure Nay we cannot taste the works of a fine genius so thoroughly as when acquainted with his life's history If we are informed of his family his education connections and conduct in private life we have a kind of comment on his writings by us which elucidates his sentiments and explains ambiguities  On these accounts mankind peruse with a peculiar pleasure any little informations concerning the lives and manners of those who have soared above the common herd of mortals by the display of any extraordinary acquisitions they have been possessed of  While some consider the character of a philosopher or a bard in some measure approaching to that of a demigod others look on it in the most contemptible light imaginable The former are chiefly composed of low illiterate people or pretended scholars the latter of substantial or ignorant tradesmen whose whole abilities consist in a plodding dull household understanding capable of the common  rules of arithmetic and calculated for the meridian of a grocer's or an oilman's shop  To both these mistaken kind of beings the following work will afford little entertainment Mr Churchill in his private conduct was not unlike any other gentleman and therefore those who expect marvellous adventures and uncommon scenes to be here related or the dirty and pitiful tricks of a poor wit to gain a precarious livelihood will be equally disappointed  Mr Churchill was a mana compounded being of flesh and spiritneither a deity nor a devil as hi  friends and foes seem to insinuateâ–ª  He had many virtues and some vices Many excellent faculties and extraordinary accomplishments and some defects Some singularities but an amazing number of winning methods the fair fruits the pure offspring of a good heart of conciliating the esteem of all his friends and acquaintances  Distress never sued to him in vain A philanthropy that knew no bounds taught him to sympathize at others woes and melt at others sorrows His purse was ever open to the poor and indigent his advice ever ready to the ignorant and dubious  Pride and revenge were strangers to him His goodsense preserved  him from the first and a thorough conviction of the truth and excellency of the christian religion and a fortitude of soul which no dangers could daunt secured him from the last  If injured by an inveterate foe his resentment was ever proportioned to the offence but if time with stealing pace crept on it erased all remembrance of it from his memory and the least concession made by the offender made Churchill his firm friend  Brave and openhearted no malice could ever lurk in his soulOf exquisite sensations the smallest injury was felt but felt to be either pardoned or despised except  when prudential caution made it necessary to resent it then due chastisement was inflicted and the offender himself forced on the return of reason to own the justice of the hand that smote him  A tiny witlingthe most contemptible of all contemptible writersthe puttertogether of dull essays for a dull newspaperon his publication of his Rosciad thought proper to asperse his character and depreciate his workChurchill was shewn the paper and told the name of its author  "You ought to resent this unprovoked attack and this false piece of criticism"  cries the friend  "Not at all" answers the bard "that is the very reason it is beneath  neath my notice I look on this wretch as the generous horse surveys the yelping cur at his heels with cold disdain and silent contempt"  Another time  those veterans that know an author by his stile  undertook to prove he was a fellow of no mark or livelihood as Shakespear expresses it and that his works were unworthy the public notice Churchill being shewn the elaborate production of these directors of the public taste and requested to answer it observed  "that if flies buzz about one it were ridiculous to regard them but if they attempted to sting it were fit they should be crushed"  Superior to corruption repeated offers that would have staggered the patriotism and sapped the very foundations of mnstrl integrity were rejected with disdain He scorned to prostitute his pen for a place or pension and had rather eat a beefsteak and drink a tankard of porter with an honest artizan than feast on ortolans or venison and drink claret and burgundy with an ignoble nobleman When his name was at the highest and he was dressed like an ambassador he would shake hands with and assist a friend in distress with a threadbare coat and despise from his very soul the star and gartered villain flaunting in embroidery  He was so thoroughly attached to the interest of OldEngland that he could not without the utmost indignation see her constitution broke by rank empirics her very vitals decayed and her whole frame brought to such a consumptive hectic state as threatened a speedy dissolution  What could be done by a private man to prevent so calamitous so fatal a catastrophe was done by him His pen was employed in the cause of honour in the cause of freedom in the cause of Britain His muse of true celestial descent engaged in the generous cause She exhorted Britons to act for the interest of Britain to spurn the venal see to disdain the galling chain  though cased with gold to deliver down the generous plan of power our ancestors had transmitted to us at the expence of their blood and treasure inviolate to posterity and to take all constitutional methods to prevent iniquitous ruinous and destructive  Scottified  measures from taking place  For this he was blamed by the fool and aspersed by the knave traduced by sycophants and whispered against by cowards but so that his country could be in the least benefited by his patriotic endeavours he regarded his foes like so many serpents who would hiss at the traveller but skulk away at the instant he was preparing to chastize them  His sincerity was ever conspicuous unquestioned and exemplary Averse to flattery he disdained receiving it himself or to bestow it on others He justly considered the use of speech is to deliver our sentiments and he thought that the man who is mean enough to speak what he does not think must be both a coward and a slave  In consequence of this opinion he was as free as cheerful and as easy in the society of a lord as a tradesman and was equally communicative of his sentiments to the learned as to the illiterate For as he was wholly exempt from selfconceit and abhorred adulation so was he conscious of speaking the dictates of his heart and justly  considered that every individual that composes a company has an undoubted right of delivering his sentiments freely to that company and though he might sometimes be unsuccessful in his endeavours to instruct he was never so in his attempt to please and entertain  A pitiful ambition of displaying superior knowledge in particular arts and sciences that have been canvassed in company is very common and is very ridiculous This fault Churchill was never guilty of and tho' his erudition and knowledge were superior to most people's and might have justified him in enforcing his sentiments with a proper warmth and to take up a longer time than persons of inferior  abilities could arrogate he ever delivered his opinion in a decent manner and was as patient an auditor as he was a skilful orator  Chearfulness is one of the most amiable accomplishments in a companion and if we may believe Mr Addison one of the peculiar characteristics of a good Christian This accomplishment Churchill possessed in a very eminent degree for being of a brave and intrepid disposition an honest man and a good Christian disappointments lost their force and could not rob him of his wonted vigour and serenity of mind  There is a wide difference between intemperate mirth and a  chearful temper The former our bard ever avoided the latter he always possessed A despondency of mind seldom indeed attends a wellcultivated judgment and a noble soul and perhaps no person was ever more free from it than Mr Churchill  He was also a firm friend and never made any professions of esteem he did not really bear a person Far from considering such professions as mere words of course he religiously observed the promises he made and punctually adhered to the friendships and connections he formed with various persons  But a perfect character as a great wit has observed is a faultless monster  a creature of the brain only that never existed in humannature Churchill is an eminent proof of the justness of this observation He had his faults but they were such as were nearly allied to and grew out of his excess of virtues As every virtue is nearly connected with some vice so every vice borders on and is not far remote from its opposite virtue Churchill's excess of generosity and contempt of sordid lucre led him to the opposite extreme and bordered on extravagance His regard for his friends induced him to disregard the narrow limits of regularity and temperance to indulge too frequently in riot and keeping ill hours and his violent and true love for his country and hatred of villainy  however dignified or distinguished hurried him to some excesses and carried him to some lengths in his writings that are not perhaps strictly justifiable by the laws of his country or consistent with the rules of decorum or goodbreeding  To sum up his character therefore concisely and candidly we deliver it as our opinion that his virtues compared with his faults are as mountains compared with molehills As a man of genius and a poet he stands one of the first in rank as a patriot his integrity remains unimpeached as a valuable member of society he is deservedly esteemed and as a firm friend and a chearful companion the tears that are shed over his urn are ample  proofs Posterity therefore shall revere and embalm our poet's memory when the malignant censures of envious snarlers who now attempt to pluck the wellearned wreath of merit from his laurelled brows and defame his character with all the rage of petulant malice shall be forgotten and when themselves shall be turned to clay and no traces of their having existed remain  CHAP II  Concise account of our design in the following workOur hero's birth education c and some account of his familyRemarkable instance of his courage and generosity in his juvenile yearsThe portrait of an illiterate insensible schoolmaster drawnAn instance of heroism and friendship between two quondam foesA cruel unfeeling pedagogue justly punished  AS it is our intention to keep as close as possible to our subject we shall avoid saying any thing of any person that is not materially interested in our history  digressions being usually very tedious and often trifling and anecdotes of persons we have nothing to do with at once insignificant and improper tending only to swell a work for the printer's and bookseller's benefit and for the reader's drowsiness and fatigue  Besides as we write the life but of one person we have no right to give the histories of several or we fulfil not properly our engagement in the titlepage and withall take an unwarrantable liberty we apprehend we have no claim to  What therefore the reader has to expect in this performance is  The Life of Mr Churchill  only and an account of and observations  on the writings he has published and it is not doubted but if we perform this work properly it will be thought we shall have matter sufficient for one volume without interspersing it with particulars of people and remarks on books foreign to our purpose  Thus much by way of proemium proceed we now to our history  Mr Charles Churchill was born near WestminsterAbbey in the house where Mrs Churchill our poet's mother now lives His father was the reverend Mr Charles Churchill curate and lecturer of St John's in Westminster a man deservedly esteemed for the integrity  of his heart and the qualifications he was endued with  Mr Churchill had but little fortune of his own and but few expectations from his relations tho' descended from an antient and honourable family  At the accustomary age Mr Charles Churchill our poet was sent to a readingschool where he behaved in much the same manner as other children of his years generally do displaying no characteristical marks of genius superior to his fellows or acting different in any respect from them  At the age of six however when some little dawnings of reason begin  to appear and the natural disposition of a boy reveals itself the temper of young Churchill might be seen It was plainly apparent that his sensibility was very quick his fortitude of mind very great his generosity conspicuous and his candor quite amiable  A striking instance of the truth of this assertion I beg leave to relate from the authority of his father who among other little anecdotes concerning his son told me the following  One of his schoolfellows an arch unlucky boy somewhat older than our hero in diverting himself with throwing of stones in conjunction with young Churchill had  the misfortune to break a pane of glass of a neighbour's window  Alarmed at the rattling of the glass and still more so with the fear of punishment the young rogue fled from the scene of action with all the precipitation his heels could furnish and his companion followed him  An enquiry was however soon made into the affair and the offender threatened with severe chastisement unless he confessed the truth Churchill's companion stiffly denied his being the aggressor and charged it on him He was accordingly called to an account informed that his playfellow had positively declared he had broken  the pane of glass and required to make an ample confession  Our young hero was so surprised at his friend's baseness and falshood that instead of vindicating his innocence and recriminating on his accuser he burst into tears The tears were construed by his schoolmaster as a sign of guilt and he was severely whipped After which notice was sent to Mr Churchill who immediately paid for the damage sustained by the breaking of the pane  This transaction happened in the schoolyard and our hero's companion hugged himself at the success of his ingenuity in escaping the punishment he feared and gloried in the betraying of his friend  After the schoolhours were over as the children were returning to their respective homes young Churchill in a firm voice charged his companion with being a liar to assert so manifest a falsity as to accuse him of breaking the glass and a coward for not daring to brave the punishment due for his crime and withall told him that since he had acted so unworthily he would beat him and never associate with him afterwards  The other confiding in his superior strength being a sturdy boy and at least a year older than our hero disregarded his threats and offered to fight him The proposal Churchill accepted with joy and they both stripped In three  minutes our hero had entirely vanquished his antagonist had made his nose bleed given him two black eyes and throwing him against a flintstone he was so much stunned that he lay quite senseless  Our hero having now taken satisfaction for the treachery shewn him his honour being satisfied clemency succeeded He raised up his friend who soon coming to himself and declaring he would fight no more Churchill told him he now forgave him  "But notwithstanding that" continued he "I will never be intimate with such a false friend again unless you ask my pardon and confess the truth that you broke the window"  The little fellow did both Our hero was applauded by every one for his courage and generosity his friend receiving so effectual a check for his perfidiousness in such early years altered his conduct and Churchill and he were good friends ever after  Another time fearing that his antagonist would receive punishment for some fault he had committed he advised him to hide the schoolmaster's birchen rod He accordingly did so the rod was missed and to effect a discovery of the offender all the boys were examined and all denied their knowing any thing of the matter The schoolmaster vowed that they should all be whipped one after  another till the offender confessed his guilt and instantly ordered that our young hero's late antagonist should be the first Churchill seeing him already horsed and ready to receive the lashes told the master if he would not whip Billy N he would inform him which boy had hid the rod The master promised he would not Billy was set down and in a stern voice the master asked our hero who the offender was and at the same time threatened he would severely chastise him or in his own words whip him within an inch of his life  All the boys now stood aghast and dreaded the menaced punishment Even conscious innocence  could not secure them from fear and their little limbs seemed robbed of their wonted functions and trembled while the pallid hue that overspread their several faces declared that each was fearful lest himself should be charged with the offence  Our hero only was unmoved Surveying his master with an attentive but respectful look "Sir" said he with a firm voice  "I only am guilty I only deserve to sufferAll my schoolfellows are entirely innocent and therefore undeserving your resentment On me inflict your scourge I deserve it and am prepared to suffer"  The unrelenting the unfeeling brute insensible to the courage and candor of the youthful hero ordered him to be horsed pulled down his breeches and the uplifted rod threatened his poor posteriors when a voice cried out  "Churchill is not guilty but I am"  This was fresh matter of surprise to the astonished pedagogue He had no sort of conception that any boy should voluntarily offer to suffer for his friend and determined on whipping both to discover the real truth  He now examined both the parties between whom this generous contest subsisted and neither could be induced from the fear of any  punishment to retract from their resolution of suffering for each otherIn short the illiterate wretch unable to feel the beauty and heroism of their conduct whipped both in the severest manner  The consequence was old Mr Churchill hearing of the affair examined into the true state of it and learnt the real truth He admired his son for his goodnature in concealing the fault of his friend and for his intrepidity in bearing the punishment due to him alone and he esteemed young Billy N his son's late antagonist in persisting to own that he only hid the rod A week after both of them were  taken from that school and sent to another where a more skilful schoolmaster and worthier man presided and the example of the parents of these young friends was followed by many others soon after  CHAP III  Our hero is taken from the readingschool and sent to that of WestminsterMakes at first but a very slow progressAn anecdote greatly to his honour and declarative of his disposition and turn of mindHe alters his conduct and applies to his learning with the greatest assiduitySome remarks on the absurdity generally practised by schoolmasters in their tuition of youthTheir excuse in their favour answeredChurchill and his father set out for Oxford that the former might be placed thereHe is examined and rejectedThey return to London  IT was not many years after this transaction that young Churchill was sent to Westminster school to  be educated in the higher branches of learning  For the first two or three years he continued here he did not display any extraordinary capacity or shew any marks of that genius he afterwards exhibited Nay he was not unfrequently incapable of making his exercise and remanded back to render it more perfect  His capacity however was infinitely superior to his assiduity He was idle fond of play averse to study and testified the utmost reluctance in conforming to the trammels of a school education  This evidently appears from his being able to go through all his exercises  whenever he thought proper to apply to them with half the attention that the generality of boys do and the following true anecdote of him is a farther proof of the truth of this assertion  Having through idleness or inattention neglected one day to make his exercise his master thought proper to chastise him very severely and at the same time reproached him for his stupidity telling him he was the most idle and ignorant boy in the school that did he still persist in his neglecting to furnish his mind with classic learning he would never be able to make a figure in life but be looked upon as a dull and illiterate blockhead a character he said the most odious that could  be imagined and which would subject him to the contempt of the wise and learned and render him fit company only for people like himself  The remonstrance had its due effect Churchill ruminated in his mind on what his master had said and he found he had spoke the truth He determined therefore he should no longer have cause to complain of him for he would be as assiduous and industrious as he had before been indolent and lazy  From this time his improvement in literature was rapid was astonishing He learnt with ease what cost others the greatest pains and he apprehended as by intuition the  true meaning of some passages that occurred to him which his companions had not the least idea of  Thus we see that what the fear of stripes could not effect the fear of shame soon produced and from henceforwards he brought his exercises finished in such a manner that he received the public thanks of all his masters and was pointed out as an example that the other boys ought to copy  These encomiums were not given in vain They filled our hero with the most agreeable sensations and excited in him greater desires of approaching still nearer to perfection  Suffer me here to make a remark a remark growing out of and connected with my subject and as such not to be looked on as a digression  Our hero's master acted extremely jndicious in his conduct He well knew Churchill dreaded not chastisement he knew he dreaded shame However that his admonition might have greater effect it was preceded by somestripes and then in the presence of all the scholars he pointed him out as the most indolent stupid boy in the whole school  It is not a little strange that we so seldom see the conduct of this master imitated Our schoolmasters  in general consult not the different dispositions of different lads they consult not the wide difference there is in point of genius between one boy and another they take the same methods of instruction with they teach the same branches of learning to all  Is not such a conduct manifestly wrong is it not incongruous to common reason and irreconcileable to the common nature of things do people of any professions men of any trades act so absurdly in this respect as schoolmaster's who should one would imagine be possessed of goodsense and discernment somewhat superior to the bulk of mankind  Does an ignorant farmer act so ignorantly as a learned schoolmaster does he sow his seeds on lands not fit for them or does he not rather consult the difference of soils and sow his seeds on those lands that are most peculiarly adapted to each  So ought a schoolmaster to do the farmer's conduct ought he to copy It is with the human mind as it is with land Some minds require little cultivation to what others do they spontaneously bring forth much good fruit while others produce little but weeds and taresYet are these last to be neglected because they want instruction most no they are rather to be mended by a different kind of manure than  what the others require With different soils different methods are taken to purge and cultivate them and so must it be with the human mind  I know but of one reason that can be assigned for the absurdity of our schoolmasters I have above pointed out Indeed it is a forcible one in their favour but it is no extenuation of the absurdity of parent's conductThe reason I mean is that so poor a pittance is given for the education of youth that it lays the master under a necessity of taking more scholars than he can possibly instruct to do all of them justice However though to gain a comfortable subsistence he is obliged to have a multitude of  pupils one quarter of which would take up his whole time to instruct properly yet did he but attend to the different capacities of his boys ever so little and had penetration and learning sufficient for the arduous profession he had assumed he might discern the various dispositions and talents of various boys and did he discharge properly the trust reposed in him he would in consequence of his observations lay his opinion before the youths parents and if after being informed of the turn and bent of their sons genius they should nevertheless persist in having them taught branches of literature their genius's were not turned for and adapted to those parents only would be in fault  Our hero having continued at school a sufficient number of years and being thoroughly conversant in scholastic education his father resolved on sending him to the university of Oxford where he himself had been educated to finish his studies  Hiring a postchaise and his son and himself getting in it they set out for the university and arrived there in about nine hours  The literate or intelligent reader need not be told that an examination is always made of the person who offers himself to be admitted with respect to his abilities in classical learning This examination our hero was now to go through  and conscious of his own abilities he dreaded it not  His father indeed had for some time before in order to render him still more assiduous at his exercises at Westminster school sought to impress an high idea of the great talents necessary for the student to be possessed of to be admitted into the university and of the profound erudition the examiner himself was master of which indeed he said was sufficiently apparent from the difficult questions he proposed to the examinant  When Churchill after vast solemnity and an awful preparation designed to intimidate him and lower his sense of his own qualifications  was led up to the examiner whose solemn visage rendered important by a bushy wig bespoke credit from a superficial observer for vast wisdom he began to think his father's description of the examiner was a just one and prepared to answer the extremely difficult questions he imagined would be proposed to him  But instead of these difficulties how amazed was he on the opening of the examiner's mouth to find the charm dissolved instead of being required to answer questions of depth and solidity he had none proposed to him but what were so superficial so frivolous and trifling that a boy of the third  class might with ease have solved them  Our hero was so astonished and so irritated at their thus treating him like an ideot as he imagined it that he could not but resent it He accordingly satirised the person whose office it was to examine him to question his abilities who was appointed to fathom his own and to ask some questions which the examiner whether from ignorance or disdain I know not did not think proper to answer  The consequence was that our hero was rejected and probably this circumstance might have given occasion to the frequent invectives  we find in his works against that most respectable university  Upon his returning from Oxford he again applied to his studies at Westminsterschool and made such a progress as was really surprising which afforded great satisfaction to his father and his friends  CHAP IV  Our hero falls in love with a very agreeable young ladyHe pays his addresses to and marries herHis father speaks to him concerning his taking on him the sacred functionHe is examined and ordained by the bishop of LondonIs promoted to a curacy in NorthWales of almost thirty pounds a yearMrs Churchill and he set out for and arrive at their destined place of residence  WHILE our hero was thus laudably employed in the cultivation of his mind his heart was most sensibly affected at the sight of Miss and he  longed for an opportunity of declaring his excess of love  He was then but seventeen was robust comely and wellproportioned exercise had thrown crimson on his cheeks and given a vigour to his limbs which effeminate beaux and slaves of indolence are entire strangers to While falsly luxurious the delicate and the debauched were impairing their constitutions and enervating their minds by dissipation and luxury young Churchill was assiduously employed during schoolhours to lay in a large stock of classic lore and afterwards in engaging in manly robust exercises which while they contributed to open his chest to brace his nerves and enure him to  brave the inclemencies of the weather or change of seasons in this varying clime not a little assisted in fortifying his mind as it is well known that the stronger and more robust a body is the more likely is it to lodge a brave and noble soul  Miss the young lady our hero had set his affections on was neither a complete beauty or a wit but she was endued with some accomplishments superior to both accomplishments that rendered her the envy of her own sex and the admiration of ours  She was judicious discreet sincere and affable possessed of virtue without austerity gaiety without levity wit without illnature  and prudence without conceit Her personal accomplishments were also sufficient to attract the attention of the most indifferent and excite the warmest desires in the coldest breast being wellshaped agreeable and displaying a certain  je ne scais quoi  in her whole appearance that invites more powerfully than haughty beauty commands  To this lady our hero contrived to get himself introduced and paid his addresses to her with all the warmth that youthful ardor could inspire  The more he knew of the lady the better he loved her If on  slight and transient view he found  his breast was touched a thorough acquaintance and a more close intimacy affected his very soul Reason approved what passion admired To fix one's esteem on a truly deserving object is at once a proof of a good head and a good heart  This proof our poet gave He perfectly idolized his charmer and every opportunity he had of being with her alone he sought to evince the greatness of his passion by pouring out the dictates of his soul in the most expressive and undissembled terms love could suggest  The artless sincere passion our hero felt the forcible the winning expressions he used in breathing  out the soft sentiments of his soul soon excited a reciprocal love in his charmer She confessed his merit she saw his accomplishments and she gave him her heart  Where a violent and a mutual flame warms two bosoms and the parties are both agreed it is not long before the aid of Hymen is required to tie the connubial knot So was it soon by our hero and his charmer and they were united in those bands which nothing but death or divorce could loose  They both now thought themselves supremely happy Possessed of each other they imagined themselves possessed of every thing that could contribute to their felicity  They were truly happy for they thought themselves so  In this comfortable state they continued for two years when our poet's father who had ever bred him up with an eye to the sacred function examined him very strictly with respect to his inclinations for he determined if he found him in the least averse to enter into the ministry that he would by no means persuade him to do it it being in his opinion extremely wrong to lay any force on the natural disposition of a person or to endeavour by any authority to prevail with him to labour in the vineyard of the Lord if his reason and inclination did not of themselves approve such a profession  On such examination he found to his great joy his son had no sort of objection to that course of life Now though he had not been educated at Oxford or taken any degree yet so thoroughly convinced was he of his son's abilities that he made no doubt of his getting him ordained and convincing the bishop that the church would obtain no small acquisition by obtaining such a member whose abilities at that time began to blaze forth with great lustre and to promise to shine in a few more years with a radiance that would astonish mankind  He was not deceived in his expectations and hopes The late worthy prelate Dr Thomas Sherlock bishop of London examined  our hero and testified no small surprize that so young a person for he was not above three and twenty should be so learned and intelligent Not content with a superficial examination as is the case on some occasions the deepest and most abstruse questions were proposed to Churchill both by the bishop himself and his chaplains to all which such pertinent and solid answers were given as perfectly astonished the examiners and made the good bishop who was acquainted with our hero's having been rejected at Oxford exclaim  "Good GOD what sort of an examiner must this gentleman have been before when he was pronounced to be deficient in scholastic education"  Being ordained by the bishop he sought to gain some preferment in the church and resolved that should he be so fortunate he would discharge the duties of his sacred function conscientiously and properly  It is well known that without interest had a man all the genius and all the wisdom and all the learning in the world he would stand but little chance of rising in the churchBut is this astonishing No It would be so indeed were it otherwise  Did genius wisdom and learning meet with that encouragement they merited we should not see pliant knaves and artful villains at  the head of affairs We should not see preferments and offices in the disposal of worthless wretches whose sole merit consists in being allied to some whe having pimped for some great vlln or been ever ready to prostitute their consciences and willing to be led as their drivers shall think proper nor should we see real genius and sound learning groaning beneath countless wrongs and holding the stirrups of those horses which baseborn scoundrels and slavish sycophants bestride  The observation is not peculiarly adapted to the church it holds good with the army law and state In each we see men that were we to ask for which of their good qualities  they were so nobly provided for we might answer we could not tell but at beholding their having thus ascended the summit of Fortune's hill we cannot help acting as we do in viewing droll uncouth figures in pieces of amber and wondering how the devil they came there  Interest in short like fancy is the queen of the world She performs every thing and fools and knaves are generally her's and fortune's favourites  If however the post of honour be a private station Churchill's was a truly honourable one With abilities that would reflect an honour on the country that gave him birth  with an ardent zeal for the spiritual and temporal welfare of mankind after living for some time privately with his wife at a little house he rented in Westminster he was  promoted  His genius his learning his piety had been visible ever since his entering into holyorders and had procured him the friendship and esteem of many judicious and pious persons but whether they were not of rank sufficient to recommend him to a living whether they wanted inclination or which is more probable whether they had poor relations enough of their own to put into rich benefices I know not but certain it is that our hero was left unprovided for and his finances  were not in the most prosperous situation till a certain clergyman seeing his abilities and his necessity promoted him to a curacy in the north of Wales that brought him in the full sum of twentyseven pounds a year which is more than can be said of a full half of the livings in that part of the world  It is no small proof of Mr Churchill's goodsense and good disposition that rather than be burthensome to his friends he accepted such a pitiful income and conformed to his situation with all the resolution of a philosopher with all the resignation of a Christian  In short his wife and he after taking leave of their father mother brothers and friends set out for Wales and arrived at the place they were to reside at in good health and spirits  CHAP V  Mr Churchill is respected by all his parishioners and followed as a very popular preacherCauses of the popularity of some preachers pointed outObservations on the nature of the subjects and style necessary for a country clergyman to treat on and make use ofHow our poet spent his time in WalesHe turns cydermanHis commodities are universally liked and his cydercellar is always fullOur poet's generosity leads him into distressesHis speech to his wife on the occasionThey resolve on returning to LondonArrive there to the great joy of all their friends  NO man ever discharged the duties of his station with greater chearfulness and assiduity  than Mr Churchill did no man was ever more loved and esteemed by his parishioners than he was They considered him in the most respectable light imaginable paid due attention to his precepts and honoured him for his worth and genius  He had not lived long in Wales before he became a very popular preacher and was followed there as much as Romaine is here  A preacher's popularity generally arises from three causes only Either from his inculcating some strange and paradoxical opinions from his working on the passions of his auditors by a vehement or persuasive oratory or from his delivering  wholsome and sound discourses written in a perspicuous easy elegant style  Our poet's popularity arose from the last assigned cause His sermons were full of the sublimest and most important truths conveyed in a plain but expressive language which though intelligible to the peasant was not unworthy the attention of a peer  By sublime and important truths I mean not disquisitions on mere speculative points or pretended explanations of mysteries but truths that come home to every one's breast that influence the moral conduct of mankind and that therefore are of the utmost conse+quence  to every person's peace of mind here and to his eternal happiness hereafter  Such only were the subjects Mr Churchill expatiated on such subjects only ought every country clergyman to treat on or it is impossible for him to discharge the duties of his function properly or edify his flock  A diction is not less to be regarded than a subject If the plainest theme be treated on in a majestic swelling style replete with tropes metaphors and allegories a congregation may go home just as wise as they came They may indeed stare at the preacher and cry him up for a profound scholar but their  admiration will be found to proceed from the same cause as that of Don Lewis's did in the play of The Fop's Fortune who honoured his nephew Carlos for his highsounding Greek though he did not understand a single syllable of it  Churchill differed so widely from preachers of this stamp that he sought to convince their reason by appealing to their reason only in a plain easy Addisonian style if I may so express myself  His good conduct in this respect cannot be sufficiently commended It is no uncommon thing for a person of low ideas little learning and less genius to write and talk in such a manner as is perfectly  adapted to the capacities of the vulgar But for a great poet whose imagination teems with lofty images and swelling figures to accommodate himself to the conceptions of the million is at once singular and amazing  In consequence of our poet's demeaning himself so prudently he was universally esteemed and tho' that part of Wales he lived in was  one of the most agreeable especially in the winter season when the raw bleak winds came whistling o'er the mountain tops piercing  he reddened cheek yet he was  ontent with his situation and employed himself in going through  he offices of his function with  leasure and when leisure permitted  climbing the mountains in search of game hunting coursing shooting angling or walking taking a chearful glass with his friends or perusing those books his own library or those of the neighbouring gentry afforded  But though he lived in a country where there was plenty of provisions which of course rendered them cheap and though he received sometimes presents from his parishioners yet how can a man maintain himself and wife on the poor pittance of twentyseven pounds a year in the manner they had been used to liveIt is impossible Churchill found it so and therefore to enlarge his scanty finances after the money he ha  brought with him from England was exhausted he resolved to enter into a branch of trade which he hoped would enable him to live in the same manner he had hitherto done  The reader will not easily conjecture what trade it was our poet pitched upon and he will not be a little surprised when told it was that of a cyderdealer He had a large cellar belonging to his house which he fitted up as genteelly as the place would admit of laid in a good stock of cyder furnished himself with mugs and glasses pipes and tobacco and hey presto my lads behold all at once the parson and poet turned publican  Indeed reader be not surprised such metamorphoses are not uncommon in Wales Parsons are there horsejockeys shopkeepers bakers barbers butchers alesellers and pigdealers  You have read Joseph Andrews I suppose if you have not I would not give a farthing for you You may there be acquainted with parson Trulliber of pigselling memory I knew the man well He was a round fat short squab fellow that understood the nature of a pig as well as any man in Wales He was educated at JesusCollege at Oxford entered into holy orders there and sold pigs and preached the Gospel at Llanridwhyd in Wales  Our poet being thus turned cydermerchant business flowed in apace  "Parson bring me a mug of the right sort"  cries one  "This is excellent stuff i'faith"  cries another  "I pray you now Mr John Jones I peseech you and intrete you now to tell me look you if you do not think this cyder is better than Lewis Morgan ap Thomas's"  asked another In short they all agreed the parson's cyder was excellent and they swore By Cot there faz not such another coot liquor in Wales look you  Churchill in the mean time pined in secret at being obliged to descend so low as to sell cyder But what could he do His pride prevented  him from begging and a generosity that knew no bounds opened his pursestrings whenever distress sued to him  He had now more supplicants than before and his doors were continually crowded with distressed wretches entreating a meal's sustenance to satiate their hunger or a drop of cyder to allay their thirst  He was a man though resolute and bold as the most bold and resolute yet cast in pity's softest mould He has given his liquor and victuals to the hungry and thirsty though he had none for a second meal for his own family and the tear of sorrow hath started from his eye at the affliction of those whom his liberal hand was unable to relieve  His money in the mean time wasted away his creditors gr  w clamorous and a goal the continual terror of indigent genius threatened him  In this exigency he was forsaken by every thing but his resolution and presence of mind He consulted with his wife on the steps proper for him to take to retrieve his affairs and she advised an application to his creditors through the mediation of some friend He approved of her counsel put it in execution but had the mortification to find they would come into no terms but insisted on an immediate payment of their several demands  In this dilemma he came to a resolution of quitting the country and returning to London  "Why should I" said he to his wife one day "by continuing here brave the horrors of a goal and run the hazard of starving It is true I could easily support the utmost misfortunes my ill fortune could inflict on me but the thought of what you must feel quite unmans me and melts me into tendernessHowever my dear don't be afflicted it is a peculiar mark of a great mind to tower above adversity Distress indeed of any kind is the test of fortitude and the touchstone of wisdom Throw off then that grief which now hangs on you and let us prepare to return to our  friends and acquaintance in London who will be extremely glad to see us and where our fate may have better things in store for us than we can reasonably expect here"  These and other expostulations tended to dry her tears and restore her to her wonted serenity of mind They afterwards prepared to settle their affairs with all the expedition consistent with personal safety and having transacted them set off for London where they arrived in seven days to the great joy of all their friends  CHAP VI  Our hero's expectations of rising in the church frustrated and the cause thereof assignedHis father diesOur hero succeeds him as curate and lecturer of St John'sHe is deservedly esteemed by all his friends and acquaintanceAssumes the office of usher to Mrs Dennis's boardingschoolA defect in the modern system of education pointed outOur hero frequents the playhouses and resolves on writing his RosciadHis wife and he have frequent disputes and wish for a separationHe publishes his Rosciad  OUR poet was not a little delighted to revisit his native country after so long and tedious  an absence and to see his relations and friends especially his brother John who is now an apothecary and druggist in Churchstreet Westminster and for whom our poet had ever a warmer affection than for any other of his brothers  It afforded no small joy to our hero's father and mother to see so cordial an affection subsisting between their sons and the old gentleman being extremely desirous of having Charles well settled did his utmost endeavours to procure him some preferment in the church but for want of interest was disappointed in his intention to his very great regret  Our poet was most sensibly mortified to find he was so neglected Independent of the reason he had to expect some good living from his acknowledged merit and abilities he had a still stronger expectation of it from the promises he had received from some pretended friends who had weight and influence enough to have served him had they been so inclinable  The truth is they found Mr Churchill was possessed of abilities superior to most that he was endued in particular with such a satyrical vein that they dreaded should he be put into any good benefice he would lash the indolence and ignorance of many of the superior clergy so roughly that they  would so smart with the anguish as to be incapable of returning the favour On this account they determined to keep him as low as possible well knowing that an irritated independent wit is a most dangerous enemy for the unworthy part of the clergy to cope with  Hed merit and genius any claim to preferment there is no doubt but our bard had been exalted to the highest But since there were such ungenerous methods taken to prevent his rising in the church it is no wonder that his highest preferment was his succeeding his father as lecturer and curate of St John's on the death of the latter which happened but a short time after our poet's return from Wales  In this situation he continued for some time doing his duty conscientiously and properly and being regarded in the most amiable light by all those that had the pleasure of his acquaintance  But even now his finances were but scanty and he had been accustomed to live well Rather than content himself with subsisting on his salary which amounted to a bare hundred a year and live an inactive kind of life he chose to labour harder and take more pains to enable himself to live more genteelly  The office he took on him wa that of usher to Mrs Dennis' boardingschool teaching the youn  ladies to write the English tongue gra mmatically correctly and elegantly a branch of learning which tho' generally neglected is of more importance than the world in general imagine  Is it not strange that such vast pains are taken to fashion the bodies of the youth of either sex to teach them all kind of ornamental accomplishments and yet neglect the cultivation of their minds and omit the useful qualifications as things of no moment  Very few young ladies very few young gentlemen are prevented from having the utmost pains taken with them at great expence of time and money to learn them to  dance to sing to play on different instruments of music and to understand French all of which branches of education though confessedly of use they have no occasion to shew themselves mistresses and masters of perhaps ten times in a year but to speak read and write their native tongue correctly and elegantly which they have occasion to make use of every day of their lives little pains are taken little expence bestowed to make them proficients inThis important tho' neglected branch of education to Mrs Dennis's honour be it spoken is taught at her school  It is no wonder that in this situation in life our poet gave great  satisfaction Master as he was of an elegance of composition and thoroughly conversant in the diversities of style he saw in a moment when the various pieces the young ladies had written were shewn to him their different excellencies and their different errors He pointed out both to them made them sensible wherein consisted the beauty of the former and taught them how to remedy the defects of the latter  But a mind like our poet's was not to be bounded within the limits of a lectureship or the pale of a school The dull tedious insipid work of continually repeating over the same form of words though confessedly the most noble in the world the most perfect the  wit or ingenuity of man can put together or to undergo the continued drudgery of instructing youth was not calculated for one  " Whose eye in a fine frenzy rolling  " Did roll from heaven to earth from earth to heaven  " And as imagination bodied forth  " The form of things unknown his skilful pen  " Turn'd them to shape and gave to airy nothing  " A local habitation and a name"  SHAKES  After being therefore at Mrs Dennis's about seventeen months he began to be tired as well a ashamed of his servile employ+ment and to recreate his mind  after being quite jaded with the fatigues of his ushership he sauntered away to the playhouse where he knew his dulness would be chased away and his melancholy expelled  So discerning a person as our poet could not frequent the theatre long before he was thoroughly acquainted with the merits and defects of the actors He thought that a work pointing them out would be of public utility as it would entertain the town and induce the sons of the drama who live on the public favour to strain every nerve to exert all their abilities to excel in their profession and render themselves still more worthy of the countenance  and encouragement of the public  This work he determined attempting He had indeed hitherto written but few pieces and those were chiefly songs and epigrams which were never published and only handed about among his most particular and intimate friends However he doubted not but he had abilities sufficient to do justice to his subject he having in one material respect the advantage of most of the writers that had preceded him which was no sort of connection or intimacy with any player whatever so that being entirely unbiassed by personal friendship or resentment his muse might  censure with candour and praise without adulation  Our poet however could not enter upon this work so soon as he willingly would on account of some private distresses he laboured under His income arising from his lectureship and ushership was but narrow and his spirit was great His living by far exceeded his revenues which obliged him to contract debts he was incapable of discharging and gave him no small uneasiness his house being continually blocked up by his creditors and surrounded by bailiffs  But this was not all the vexation he laboured under About this time some domestic disputes still  more afflicting happened Mrs Churchill and he had frequent quarrels and a separation was talked of and desired by both as advantageous to both  It is by no means incumbent on me as a biographer or a man to enter into circumstances of this nature and relate the origin and progress of such an unhappy dissention Private family affairs are unfit for the public eye They are of too tender and too delicate a nature to be divulged Suffice it that our poet and his lady DID NOT AGREE To say more would be to injure one of the parties at the expence of the other  His debts were however soon discharged or his creditors satisfied  by the benevolence of Mr Lloyd and our hero then determined he would retard his work no longer but proceed on it instantly  About the time of his forming this resolution his late ingenious friend Mr Robert Lloyd the son of the beforementioned gentleman published a poetical epistle called The Actor which was addressed to Mr Bonnel Thornton and was looked on as a piece of infinite merit and its author ranked among the most eminent writers of the age  Fired by his friend's example animated with a laudable emulation our poet sat down and composed his Rosciad A work which enters into  a close and minute discussion of the various excellencies and faults of the several actors and actresses of both theatres ascribing due praises to those who were eminent in their different walks to use a theatrical phrase and satirising those who buoyed up on the bladders of selfconceit imagined themselves great actors when to use a wellknown though somewhat coarse simile they might be compared to pieces of horsedung which swimming down a river with some goldenpippins proudly cried out  "See how we apples swim"  Having finished his piece he published it but without setting his name to it as its author The town were divided in their sentiments  concerning its writer but allowed it vast merit Unwilling to ascribe so much fame to one alone it was said it was the offspring of a combination of wits The authors of the Critical Review in particular pronounced pointblank it was written by Lloyd They valued themselves they said on knowing any author by his style and however the common herd of critics might be imposed on by a false judgment they affirmed it was impossible to deceive them the skilful veterans of the age Others declared it was the jointproduction of Lloyd Thornton and Colman and the reason they gave for their opinion was somewhat singular because they said no one man was capable of producing so finished a piece  These sagacious veteran critics and others were however shewn their error in judgment on the publication of the second edition which came out with the name of its author Our poet was now regarded as a firstrate genius his acquaintance was cultivated by every man of taste and his fame was every day more and more extended  CHAP VII  Our hero gets acquainted with Mr Garrick who entertains a great regard for himHe publishes his Apology addressed to the Critical ReviewersThose critics are at a loss how to demean themselves and almost resolve to leave off businessOur hero throws off his gown and gets rid of his wifeHis letter to me on that occasionHe frequents public places in search of food for satireHis conduct in that respect vindicatedIn what respects the republic of authors are obliged to himSome remarkable instances of the gratitude and wisdom of booksellers  AMONG the many honourable friends and acquaintances our hero gained by the publication  of his Rosciad may be reckoned Mr Garrick who gave him the freedom of his house and entered into the strictest intimacy with him  Shortly after the Critical Reviewers had thought proper to attack his piece by giving a lame and injudicious account of it and according to their usual custom selecting some of the worst lines they could find in it and giving them as specimens of the work our poet thought proper to publish his Apology addressed to them in which he severely lashes those pseudocritics those selfappointed censors who have forced themselves into the chair of Aristarchus with a view to direct the public taste and who  filch away the reputations of the good and great with as little remorse as hardened high waymen steal purses  They were extremely nettled with the just satire they had drawn on themselves and would have recanted would have begged our poet's pardon would have fallen down on their marrowbones and like naughty schoolboys when convicted of a fault would have promised never to do so again but our poet despised them too much to heed their suppliant posture or their pitiful promises He was equally unconcerned at their insidious malice and their avowed repentance  The town was extremely diverted at the poor devils expence They  had never been so thoroughly scourged before They had brought an enemy on them they knew not how to get rid of and such an enemy as neither their numbers could daunt or their bribes corrupt  These assassinators of mens characters began now to sear Conscious guilt hallood in their ears the infamy of their proceedings the infamy in depreciating the works of the learned and ingenious and injuring the property of the purchasers of those works They would gladly have lest off their assassination trade but alas if they did they must not cat for every meal of victuals they procure is purchased at the expence of the bleeding  reputation of some man of worth  Our hero's fame being greatly extended by these productions and his pockets filled the first two editions of the Rosciad only bringing him in three hundred pounds he came to a resolution of depending entirely on his muse for subsistence and he made no doubt of meeting the public favour as long as he should continue to merit it  But to do this he considered his gown as an insuperable obstacle While he wore it he could not with propriety frequent many places which as an author who must see life in all its variegated scenes if he would paint them it  was absolutely necessary for him to do All therefore for him to consider was whether he would be a lecturer and curate with a bare hundred a year or a layauthor with a goodly prospect of gaining fifteen hundred  He chose the latter He threw aside his gown and commenced layman and though he was blamed for it by some and ridiculed by others yet I cannot but think for my own part that he acted perfectly right and I doubt not but the unprejudiced and intelligent will be of the same opinion after they have perused the following letter he sent to me by the pennypost on that occasion  To *** ***  DEAR ***  I HAVE in both respects acted as I told you I would the last time I was at your house I have got rid of both my causes of complaint the *** I was tired of and the gown I was displeased with  You have often heard me say I had no sort of chance of enjoying any ecclesiastical preferment and that I heartily despised being a pitiful curate Why then should I breathe in wretchedness and a rusty gown when my muse can furnish me with felicity and a laced coat  Besides why should I play the hypocrite Why should I seem contented with my lowly situation when I am ambitious to aspire at and wish for a much higher Why should I be called to an account by a dull phlegmatic *** for wearing white thread stockings when I desire to wear white silk ones and a sword In short *** I have looked into myself I have examined myself attentively and I have found I am better qualified to be a gentleman than a poor curate It has been therefore from principle I have shook off the old rusty gown the pissburnt bob and the brown beaver which set so uneasy on me I find no pricks of conscience for  what I have done but am much easier in my mind I feel myself in the situation of a man that has carried a dd heavy load for a long way and then sets it downSo much for my *** and gown  I shall be at the Shakespear tomorrow night and shall be glad to see you there And believe me to be dear *** what I really am and always shall continue  Your c C CHURCHILL  Our poet having thus thrown aside his gown behaved as any other gentleman with similar inclinations would do He frequented taverns  and coffeehouses places of public diversion got acquainted with bucks and bloods and people of all sorts of characters and in order to see low as well as high life did not disdain sometimes to go into obscure publichouses the better to observe the different scenes which different places would afford  These actions have been imputed as a disgrace to him as reflecting on his moral character and tending to lessen him in the eyes of the public With submission we are of a different opinion We think he acted extremely right and that an author like him who would render himself capable of exhibiting portraits of the different stations of life and humours of different men  could not do better than to be an eyewitness of those different stations and humours An author who thinks to paint scenes he never saw must make a very poor hand of it His descriptions must resemble nothing in the heavens above the earth beneath or waters under the earth but an author possessed of tolerable abilities if spectator of those scenes he describes must by far excel one with the highest who never saw those things he attempts to give his readers an idea of  Thus much we thought proper to observe in justification of our poet and we beg leave farther to observe in justification of our own remark and as a proof of its solidity that had not Mr Churchill  acted as he did in frequenting so many public places and seeing so many characters of different kinds the world would not have such highlyfinished descriptions of persons and things from his pen as it now can boast of  He is also to be commended in other respects in setting an example to writers to print their works correctly and elegantly with a good type and on good paper to fix a gentleman's price on them not a mere Grubstreet author's to receive the profits themselves not suffer them to be pocketed by mercenary booksellers who if they give but five guineas copymoney for a work and make five hundred of it will not present the author  with a single shilling moreFew Andrew Millars are to be foundand lastly by exhibiting a noble example to every bard and author how they should behave to those who live by THEIR labours and without which they would be in as wretched a state as they would have them  Suffer me here to relate five true stories I could relate five score but five are enough  Paradise Lost by John Milton was sold for fifteen pounds The bookseller gained five hundred by the publication The author being in distress wanted to borrow of the bookseller five guineas  The bookseller's gratitude refused him  Joseph Andrews was sold for three hundred guineas It had a rapid sale The bookseller Mr Andrew Millar cleared money by it and sent Mr Fielding the author unasked a present of one hundred guineas  Tristram Shandy was offered to divers Booksellers for fifty pounds and they offered seven The author printed the first edition on his own account and cleared upwards of two hundred pounds by the sale Mr Dodsley then purchased the copy and has gained much money by it  Little Derrick the great author sold a novel for three guineas The bookseller gained fifty pounds by the publication  "Lend me a guinea" said Derrick "if you have any gratitude at all"  "I have it not" answered the bookseller  Churchill's Rosciad was offered to three different booksellers for twenty pounds They all said the copymoney was too high but they would give two guineas He published it himself and gained by all the editions of it seven hundred pounds  So much for booksellersAnd now let me ask any impartial  author Whether as an author he is not obliged to our bard for seting him an example how he ought to actReturn we now to our hero  CHAP VIII  Our hero assists an intimate and a valued friend in distressAdvice to malicious detracting authors not to rake up the sacred ashes of the deadMr Churchill publishes his Night addressed to his friend LloydThe ill tendency of that piece pointed out and shewn to be the most exceptionable of his performancesHe publishes his GhostMr Johnson shewn to be undeserving our hero's lashThe Prophecy of Famine published  MR CHURCHILL gaining money now apace had it in his power to display the native temper of his mind which was an unrestrained benevolence that was  ever exerted in relieving the distressed  His most intimate friend and brother bard was at this time arrested for some debts he was incapable of discharging and thrown in the Fleet Every one lamented the fate of so great a genius and were sorry at his misfortunes but no one except Churchill offered to give him any thing butpity a poor gift and a scanty diet for a man to subsist on  Our hero who could not see his friend's distresses with apathy visited him almost daily and with a generosity unparalleled in these days gave Kearsly the bookseller orders to send him a guinea every  week and charge it to his account which was accordingly done  Is not this a striking proof of his goodness his greatness of mind Is not such a generous action sufficient to atone for many faults Can an equal instance of humanity and true friendship be produced by any person if the circumstances of the donor be compared with our bard's Let then ye snarling envious poetasters ye tiny witlings ye mongrel authors who feast on an inharmonious line with as much greediness as a hound will devour carrion regardless of the nervous sentiment and incapable of feeling the beauty of a friendly a humane a moral a Christian action let then the sacred ashes of our poet  rest in peace With more than savage brutishness call not up his errors from the grave Cull not with a villainous industry some few foibles which as a man he possessed which as a poet his whirl of imagination might lead him into to serve them up as a feast for knaves and villains Imitate his virtues and if possible acquire his abilities but let his faults be buried with his dust Let the green turf lie lightly on his breast and tear not away with sacrilegious hands the lawrelled wreath that binds his honoured brows  The next work our poet published was Night addressed to Mr Robert Lloyd a piece which tho'  written with great spirit and replete with true poetry is the most exceptionable of any of his performances it being grounded upon false principles The chief design of it seems to be to prove that whatever follies we possess we should not undertake to conceal them  That this doctrine is essentially false and is absolutely baneful to society is evident if we only consider that example is ever more prevalent than precept If the abandoned and the wicked were to take no pains to conceal their several crimes especially were they in high stations other people would think themselves justifiable in imitating them perhaps laudable  since the commonalty look on it as extremely praiseworthy to ape their betters not only in fashions and follies but vices and the gentry seem to be of the same opinion by their imitating as near as possible the nobility  After the publication of this piece he wrote his Ghost a work of vast merit in which he displays great knowledge of the world rea  genius and sheer wit The only fault I can find with this performance is his indulging a vein of satire rather too severe particularly his attacking some respectable characters with too much wanton cruelty  Of these Mr Johnson stands foremost A gentleman of great reputation  as a scholar and a wit a man with such a comprehensive mind as to understand most subjects so thoroughly as would lead one to suspect he had made the study of each the sole business of his life This gentleman is there characterized under the name of Pomposo and lashed with a severity he had by no means deserved of our poet But indeed the edge of the satire is entirely taken off when it is considered that every one that reads the character knows Mr Johnson is the author of The Rambler a work which has enlarged the circle of moral enquiry and fixed more precise landmarks to guide philosophy in her investigation of truth  The Prophecy of Famine succeeded the Ghost It had a rapid  and a prodigious sale was universally approved except by those who felt the keenness of its scourge  But why should I give an account of his poems he published HERE That I shall do perhaps at some future time only I thought it necessary to say something of his first publications in order the better to account for that degree of fame and popularity he experienced  CHAP IX  Our poet forms connections with many patriots and men of rankReason for not giving an account of our bard's affair with a certain young ladyHe takes her with him to ParisHe writes to me from thenceHis letter on the remarkable contrast between the behaviour of the primitive and modern clergy  NOTHING very material happened to our hero for some time unless his intimate acquaintance with Mr Wilkes Mr Lloyd  Mr Robert Lloyd died in the Fleet Prison on Saturday the th of December grief at the death of his friend Churchill not a little hastening his own as generally imagined  Mr Woty Mr Lewis  c and forming many other connections with men as eminent for their love of their country and regard for genius as for their rank and fortune may be termed such  An event however soon happened that I wish I could pass over in silence But as I have declared that in writing the life of this great poet I will  " Nothing extenuate  " Nor set down ought in malice"  It may be expected I should relate the affair that happened between him and a certain young lady Miss Cr with whom he went to France and lived with for some timeIt may I say be expected  from me but when I declare to my readers that I know not the whole of that affair I hope they will excuse me from publishing any part of it as I know but of little frivolous circumstances relating to it especially if they consider that it is the business of a biographer either to give a true and faithful narrative of transactions or entirely to omit themInstead then of soiling some pages with the relation of an affair I profess myself ignorant of unless superficially I shall act a much better part by giving the reader a letter I received from Mr Churchill at Paris at that very time and which cannot be deemed a digression as every little piece our hero was the author of may with the utmost propriety be  published in a work that contains memoirs of his life  To ***** *****  My dear ****  I was quite overjoyed to receive your letter and to find you are well Many thanks for the commission you have executedI doubt not but the books will come safeI am on another piece which I doubt not will take as well as my Prophecy did and will finish it as soon as I canThe times I know are ticklish and when * * * * * * * * * * * But I don't despair The native courage and good sense of Englishmen are known to every  one and when the former perceives how egregiously they are duped by a * * * * * * * * But why do you ask me to draw a parallel between the conduct of the antient and modern clergy You mean a contrast I suppose I will however having a little leisure give you a few broken hints  The antient clergy lived very different from our modern and acted very different The time hath been too when rich benefices and fat livings were bestowed on the pious and the learnedAre they so now No They are not They are frequently given to ignorance and  impiety and always to the person that has interestI defy any one to assign a rational cause for so irrational a conduct  Why a worthy and a learned man who discharges all the duties of his function with a conscientious exactness whose life is a written comment on his doctrine and who has a numerous family to provide for should be punished for his piety and learning in being forced to live on a poor stipend a journeyman taylor or a cobler would scorn to accept is to the eye of impartial reason amazing But is it less so to find a man who preaches not three times a year who never performs the duties of his function  whose life is mean and scandalous and who has neither capacity nor integrity to act the man or the divine rewarded with thousands a year  How did the primitive clergy liveDid they order the earth air and sea to be ransacked for their respective dainties Were they like our modern superior clergy driven about lolling in superb vehicles and drawn by fiery steeds to places of diversion and false gaiety No they were not nor did they in any respect live as our modern blackgown'd gentry do  Survey for a moment my dear * * * * the infinite contrast  between antient and modern religionThe religion of Jesus was plain simple pure and holy Its priests were of blameless life of upright manners clad in mean apparel dignified with no titles but Servants of the Lord Their food was mean and often scanty their journeys tedious and frequent their accommodations mean and wretched their persons exposed to perils and their deaths painful and ignominious  But good God what a contrastPomp and splendor are the characteristics of our church Our priests are wanton lascivious and depraved Their apparel superb and singular calculated  to catch the eye and excite reverence They proudly vaunt themselves ambassadors of the Almighty They live on turtle and ortolans and drink claret and champagne and burgundy I could not while a clergyman drink claret and champagne and burgundy Their journeys are I must confess as frequent as those of the Apostles and primitive clergy but they are tothe Playhouse to Vauxhall or Ranelagh  Now what remains Why after this superb scene is drawn a scene embellished with every decoration that art can invent with every magnificence luxury can suggest their clay is inclosed  in a highwrought splendid receptacle put in the solemn sable herse whose top is all over decorated with nodding plumes and drawn by six noble steeds cloathed in Genoa velvet and then attended with multitudes of grand coaches the pampered highfed clay now the more sumptuous feast for worms is conveyed to the church and then amidst the blaze of waxtapers and assembled spectators is set down and after a noble form of words is frittered away by some perriwigpated fop is deposited in a sumptuous vault and not suffered to mingle with meaner dust A monument is afterwards erected of Parian marble chisseled into elegance  by the hands of a Rysbrack or a Wilton and lest the dull haughty prelate's learning and humility should be forgot the genius of some venal author is prostituted to describe virtues he never possessed and accomplishments he was an absolute stranger to  How do you like my picture Is it not a just one Heavens do you think I could with any conscience continue in a profession where such r***lly practices prevail * * *  Your assured friend C CHURCHILL  CHAP X  He returns to LondonIs considered not only as a great poet but an able politicianSentiments of our poet respecting the state of affairs in He is threatened with terrible punishments and promised great preferments if he will turn his coatModest proposal made to him by two agentsHis opinion of Mr Johnson and Mr GuthrieWhat success the agents met with from our bardThey are within an Ame'sace of having their a's kickedDepart in a greater hurry than they came  MR CHURCHILL continued at Paris about three months and then returned to London  On account of some political pieces he published his fame was now in its meridian He was regarded as a skilful politician as well as a great poet He was indeed looked on as one of the most formidable champions in the cause of Liberty and Britain against domestic treachery and Scottified measures  He thought the interest of his country was sacrificed at the shrine of perfidy that great villains robbed the public with impunity that vice prevailed and impious men bore sway while skill and integrity were driven from the helm of state and discarded with disgrace  He was not singular in these notions Every honest unplaced unpensioned independent Englishman thought the same But more cautious or rather more timid than our patriotic bard they dared not whisper in such perilous times when prosecutions and pillories and fines and general warrants and imprisonments and expensive journeys were become so frequent and when browbeating aygls held the scourge of law over the heads of those who were bold enough to own themselves friends and lovers of their countryâ–ª they did not I say dare to whispe  those sentiments our poet openly avowed and gloried in  He was frequently threatened o  account of his generous attachme  to the cause of liberty Several very menacing letters were sent to him in private and frequent denunciations appeared against him in the public papers with a view to shake his integrity and blast his future fame to bring him over to the other party and to induce him to espouse by his discourse and writings those principles and vindicate those measures he had before abhorred and pronounced baneful to his country and prejudicial to its true interest  But this was not all Promises were also made and assurances given of high rewards and preferments if he would join the my cry up the glorious and honourable peace and write against those faithful  servants of the crown who had served their country with skill and fidelity and raised her reputation to the highest degree of splendor from the lowest and most abject situation conceivable when she had been insulted and pd on by almost every state in Europe  He was also to call in his writings an avaricious cowardly wealthy de who took a beating at a public horserace a generous brave and honest manAn ignorant and pusillanimous pemkr a learned and upright ministerA cricketplayer debauchee and informer a very pious chaste and worthy gentleman In short he was to nickname every thing to prostitute his conscience and his  pen to depreciate and vilify his country and countrymen and to lavish the most boundless panegyric upon Scotland and Scotsmen  These shallow secondsighted Scottified statesmen could not have applied to a more improper person than our bard He was equally unmoved at their threats and promises He despised the men and measures too heartily to vindicate them he loved his country and her patriots too sincerely to betray them  Finding our poet proof against their artifices or force and that he stood like a rock against which the furious winds bellow and waves beat in vain two of the m's agents proposed to him that since  he could not be brought to concur in and espouse their cause openly and by his writings that if he would only promise on his honour not to write against them he should be paid three hundred a year for his silence  To this proposal the bard gave this answer  "I am amazed you should think I would accept so infamous an offer To be silent when viewing treachery and villainy and not to expose them is to be a partaker and pensioners Jn and Ge are not less infs for consenting to drop their pens than if they had wrote for the present admn"  Fain would the two agents have prevailed on the poet to change his  resolution fain would they have persuaded him to have sapped the foundations of liberty to have vindicated arbitrary and illegal measures and to have proved a bastardson of his country But they might as well have attempted to have torn up the rooted oak to have called in question the wisdom and integrity of a Temple to have shaken down the mighty battlements or like another Sampson pull down the strong pillars of Gaza  They laboured extremely hard to effect their purpose which our poet considering as a direct implication and suspicion of his integrity his anger rose to so high a pitch that he swore if they did not leave his house that moment he would kick them out of doors  Not choosing to give him this trouble they decamped with precipitation fearing our poet would be as good as his word but not before he had assured them that if they ever dared to come to his house again on such errands he would cut off their ears  Our bard's behaviour on this occasion has induced his enemies to represent him as a turbulent man They may call him indeed a man of spirit and a man of integrity but sure I am every true lover of his country  "with courage to have made his love known"  would have acted as he did  CHAP XI  Our poet's manner of life at his house on ActoncommonHis quarrel with Hogarth truly statedThe painter's print occasions the poet's epistleThe effects the latter had on HogarthOur bard's dispute with D****n L***h slightly touched on and why  OUR poet now lived very comfortably and very happily He wanted not for money nor for friends He had taken a very genteel wellbuilt house on Actoncommon which he furnished extremely elegant kept his postchaise saddlehorses and his pointers fished fowled hunted coursed  and took all the diversions of the season he approved at those hours he retired from study and lived in an independent easy manner every man of genius ought to do but which every man of genius cannot afford  His writings in favour of that administration that brought glory and honour to GreatBritain and strengthened its interest among others had given offence to Hogarth the ingenious and truly comic painter whose works will immortalise his name who having a place at court as serjeantpainter espoused the cause of that administration that brought infy and dishr to Britain and that MADE THE PEACE OF  The bard and painter having notice that the other would attend a late remarkable trial at Westminsterhall came there with a view to exercise their different functions the bard to satirise his antagonist for abusing Mr Pitt and other great statesmen and the painter to catch a ridiculous likeness of the poet so as to represent him in caricature  They saw each other and after the trial was over departed  Presently comes out a print of a bear hugging a full pot of porter in his paws underneath a pugdog pissing on Mr Churchill's works with some other circumstances the reader need not be told  It would puzzle the most penetrating person had he the eyes of Lynceus to see the wit of all this but lest it should be lost at the bottom is wrote  "The reverend Mr Churchill in the character of a Russian bear"  Alas Alas It is but a too melancholy truth of the frailty of human nature and a too visible proof of the decline of genius that Hogarth a painter in his peculiar walk rivalled by none superior to all should to indulge a personal resentment publish a foolish trifling insignificant print to provewhatwhy that he hated Mr Churchill and that his own abilities were quite decayed  Glad should I have been had our poet disdained taking notice of it though the world would thereby have been deprived of a fine nervous manly piece of writing that breathes a spirit of poetry and humanity equally honourable to the bard and to the man  Hogarth was my friend and my companion I honoured him and loved him and I could not without the most poignant grief behold the extreme indignation he testified in reading the former part of our poet's epistle his Russian Bear had occasioned and the compunction of soul he felt in reading the conclusion where the generous bard pays him greater compliments and lavishes higher encomiums on him  as a painter and with more justice than the united compliments and encomiums that had been given him by all former authors and poets  It has been said the severity of our poet's satire the justness of his remarks and the warmth of his panegyric broke the painter's heart Though I cannot absolutely believe this yet I believe it contributed not a little towards it especially if we consider that for some months after the publication of the print and epistle poor Hogarth was lashed most unmercifully in all the public papers his defenders were illiterate and without genius rather betraying his cause than serving it and as is too frequently the case hurting him by their injudicious praises  Our poet had also some disputes with D****n L***h his quondam printer but as that affair is so recent in every one's memory and so generally known I shall not give an account of it here I must however beg leave to observe that however faultless our poet might be in his quarrel with the painter I can scarcely think he was entirely so in that with the printer as Mr L***h is a very honest deserving man and a very intelligent and good artist  CHAP XII  Our poet's great regard for Mr Wilkes and Mr LloydHe sets out for France to see the formerTheir meeting at BoulogneOur poet is taken ill of a malignant feverHis letter to me on that occasionHe dies  THE friendship of Pylades and Orestes was not greater or more sincere than the friendship of Churchill Wilkes and Lloyd This triumvirate had a real esteem for each other and would have gone to the utmost limits of the earth or performed any arduous task within their power to have served their friend  There are fewer friends on earth than kings is an antient saying and is a true one Whenever therefore we meet with such a phoenix as faithful friends we ought to look on them in the most amiable light and regard them as we regard comets or eclipses especially if those friends like the three above named are endued with great and extraordinary abilities and possessed of an integrity of soul and fortitude of mind which adverse fortune cannot daunt or the most prosperous circumstances enervate  Our poet longed so exceedingly to see his friend Wilkes who had been exiled his country by the rigorous hands of power for writinghis sentiments and who had  taken refuge in France that he set out in his postchaise for Dover from whence he crossed over to Calais and immediately proceeded to Boulogne where Mr Wilkes was  Their meeting was joyful and affectionate They thought themselves extremely happy after so long an absence to enjoy each other's society and they plumed themselves on the satisfaction they should receive in a reciprocal communication of sentiments and plans they had formed for their future conduct  But alas how transitory are all sublunary things how fleeting and uncertainThe present moment only is ours the next we are not assured ofLike the baseless fabric  of a dream we see our goodly prospects in life vanish away when we awake to immortality from this bed of death  Shall I pursue the subject No There is no occasionShall I relate the sequel of poor Churchill's lifeFain would I dispense with itWould it were not in my power  In short our bard a few days after his arrival at Boulogne was seized with a malignant fever and was sensible his time was come  To express the anguish of soul Wilkes felt requires a pen like his own to describe or rather it is undescribable He felt all the pangs and tortures human nature can feel  when robbed of all the soul of man holds dear  Two days before his death my friend my companion my loved Churchill wrote me the following letterHeavens what were my emotions in reading itWhat did I not feel at that juncture  To *** ***  MY DEAR ***  THE curtain is almost drawn and the farce is overI hope I trust a better world will receive me My last told you the expectations I had which are now turned to assurances May you live long and happyMay all my friends live so tooand may all of you die the death  of the righteousOh my poor bleeding country Even in death I must think of thee distracted by intestine feuds and Scotsmen preying on thy very vitalsMay Heaven preserve OldEngland and her true friend PittMay the glorious band of patriots now assembled rescue her from her chains and may the 's eyes be openedOh *** I know not what more to say but that I have left every thing to * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Till the last gasp will I breathe this prayer Oh GOD shower down thy choicest favours on England and Englishmen and infuse into them a spirit to defend their rights and liberties their religion and propertyFarewell  and in death believe me to be  Dear ***  Your friend C CHURCHILL  The second day after writing this letter my friend expired He died calm and composed sensible and resigned In his last moments he recommended the publication of some papers interesting to his country's welfareIn the agonies of death he sought he prayed for his country's goodThen with a serene smile on his countenance invoking the GOD of mercy for forgiveness he resigned his soul into the hands of him that gave it
