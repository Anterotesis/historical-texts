 THE LEGAL MEANS OF POLITICAL REFORMATION Proposed in two small Tracts  viz  THE FIRST On  "Equitable Representation"  and the  legal  Means of obtaining it  THE SECOND On "  Annual Parliaments  the  ancient  and  most salutary  "RIGHT of the People"  THE THIRD EDITION  THE LEGAL MEANS OF POLITICAL REFORMATION  NEVER were the baneful effects of  undue influence  more sensibly felt or more generally acknowledged than at present  The  legal  means of curbing this dan∣gerous evil are proposed in two little tracts presented with this paper The one points out a  legal  mode of obtaining a  more equal representation of the Commons  The other demonstrates the ancient po∣pular right of holding  newelected  Parlia∣ments  every year once and more often if need be  And the sum of both jointly considered may be included in the fol∣lowing short proposition that  a more equal representation of the Commons in an∣nual Parliaments i e  ELECTED  eve∣ry year once and more often if need  be    is not only an  ANCIENT  but even an  INDISPENSABLE  right of the people  That this ancient constitution is  indispen∣sable  the many fatal effects of deviating from it have rendered sufficiently obvi∣ous and therefore no  remedy  can be more efficacious and constitutionally natural than a  revival  of that  primitive and fundamental right  according to the rule of Law that  as often as any

elected and retorned together  An Hen V  REMARKS  c  THE circumstances of those antient times are so totally different in many respects from the present times that it is difficult to determine whether any such  joint  elections of knights citizens  and burgesses by the united equal suf∣frages of all the electors together of e∣very degree in each county can now be made and of course it is doubtful whether such a measure is even advise∣able Many laws have since been en∣acted respecting elections all of which must first be well weighed and consi∣dered for if any thing therein is in∣compatible with the necessary alterati∣ons it must be repealed by the same authority which ordained it because  non est recedendum a forma per statu∣tum prescripta  and again  nil temere novandum est  Yet as the injustice and fatal conse∣quences of the present enormous  ine∣quality of representation  in favour of pet∣ty venal boroughs to the disadvantage of the counties and great cities is noto∣rious and undeniable some prudent re∣medy is surely become necessary and ought to be most earnestly sought after  by all lovers of peace and good govern∣ment  The ruinous effects of a long conti∣nued  parliamentary corruption  and of its baneful companion  national repro∣bacy  which is the sure harbinger of  pub∣lic misfortune  and  approaching slavery  have made such hasty advances of late that many people begin to be alarmed and to talk seriously concerning the ne∣cessity of endeavouring to obtain  a more equal representation of the com∣mons in annual parliaments  as the true legal means of restoring public credit and of saving the state  Such a disposition towards parliamentary re∣formation I have perceived in several places amongst people who have not the least connexion with each other so that it seems to be the most natural and ob∣vious conclusion of common sense upon the present alarming state of public af∣fairs and will probably if matters  should grow worse become more and more general till the measure be irre∣sistibly demanded by the voice of the people in which case all those persons who have been most concerned in the management of the public treasury must expect to undergo a severe scrutiny Or if any sudden invasion of our natu∣ral enemies should be really intended which there is but too much reason to suspect the people it is to be feared as soon as they are informed of the pub∣lic danger will be so transported with sudden indignation against particular per∣sons whose measures may seem to have contributed to the national weakness that they will not easily be restrained from violent and inconsiderate acts of personal resentment And it is not at all probable that the people will be tho∣roughly or sufficiently united to act a∣gainst the common enemy until they have taken such steps as they may think  effectual to insure a reformation of go∣vernment in case their endeavours a∣gainst the common enemy should prove successful and to prevent the like cala∣mities in future  Those stateministers therefore who shall have sufficient courage to give up in time all reliance on  undue parlia∣mentary influence  and shall prove that their regard for good and  legal govern∣ment  is sincere by promoting some le∣gal means of restoring to the electors of  counties  and  great cities  their due pro∣portion of  representation  and  consequence in the great national assembly  those mi∣nisters I say howsoever their former measures may have been disliked will by such a proof of their  sincerity  in re∣formation  insure to themselves  the pub∣lic esteem and confidence for there is a general disposition in Englishmen to overlook all differences of opinion in po∣litics and to forget all party animosities  against those persons who by a change of conduct give proofs of a future re∣gard for popular and constitutional rights And the almost certain advantages to the crown by adopting and promoting such a measure will be  the recovery of a great and extensive empire  Memorandum These Remarks were written in March The author had previously informed a nobleman in administration that the Americans were inclined to a  reunion  even  under the crown  on consti∣tutional principles provided his majesty's ministers could give a  proof of their sincerity  in treating by adopting some  legal  means of  political reformation  at home and that the proper constitutional terms con∣sistent with the natural rights of British subjects would certainly be  accepted  if tendered within two or three months but that no terms short of  independency  would or could be accepted after the expiration of six months from that time The desire of pointing out such a  plan of reformation  as might be suitable to the proposed  re∣union  occasioned these remarks  for no ground of accommodation will be so effectual and certain as such  "a proof of sincerity"  in the sovereign that he desires to rule his subjects  at home  according to the strictest rule of  legal  and  constitutional princi∣ples  and is willing to drop all measures  or designs which cannot obtain the  un∣influenced assent  of his great national council and the king's ministers are never answerable for measures howsoe∣ver unsuccessful after the same have ob∣tained the sanction of  a free  and  unin∣fluenced  parliament By such  righte∣ousness  as this  the throne shall be establish∣ed  whereas an obstinate perseverance and continuance in the contrary mode of administration will of course occasion what is vainly called a  statenecessity  for advancing still farther in violent and un∣popular measures which like the case of Richard II  But the king was not satisfied with these re∣peated declarations he thought his power and dig∣nity very precarious while it depended on the  au∣thority of parliament  He dreaded the popular party and the effects of opposition and resistance which he had so lately experienced and could not bear the restraint which these apprehensions laid him under His whole views therefore were from this time directed to one end  to set himself above all opposition and resistance  first by making peace and gaining firm alliance abroad and then  by establishing an un∣controllable power at home  In consequence of this design he entered with more earnestness upon a treaty of peace with France  c  See the learned bishop Lowth's Life of William of Wykeham p King Richard's obstinate perseverance in such erroneous and dangerous notions produced those very evils of which he was most afraid  viz  the loss of  his crown  his liberty and his life for the Machiavelian policy of his ministers in promoting  parliamentary corruption  and in maintaining a  standing army  of Chesh∣ire timeservers served only to precipitate the mo∣narch's destruction and to hasten the revolution  must inevitably end in destruction No reformation howe∣ver can be safely made respecting  a  more equal representation of the com∣mons  until the mode of doing it hath been first adopted and approved by  the majority of the  ELECTORS  themselves in each county  but when their consent is once obtained the ostensible propo∣sers and promoters of the measure will be amply secured from all blame in case the alteration should not prove effectual and on the other hand they will cer∣tainly enjoy the principal credit of the a∣mendment in case the measure should be found to answer the desirable purpose  The king might safely signify in a speech to his parliament or by procla∣mation his earnest desire to be more accurately informed of the sentiments of his people and that he therefore wishes to promote by legal and consti∣tutional means a  more equal represen∣tation  of all persons who are at present entitled to vote for  knights citizens  and  burgesses  in parliament that elections may be made in an  equitable and just pro∣portion to the  NUMBERS of those who vote for each denomination without les∣sening the total number of representa∣tives sent up at present from each coun∣ty and he might refer the consideration of the most just and unexceptionable means of doing this to the very persons whose rights are concerned by autho∣rising his sheriffs to summon grandjuries in their respective counties to consider and propose the most equitable mode of sending the present number of knights  citizens and burgesses for each coun∣ty in  an equal proportion to the whole number of electors  and afterwards to submit the result of their consultation to a generalcourt or assembly of all the electors in each county for their assent or amendment or to a chosen  committee  appointed by a majority of all the said electors that shall think fit to attend the assembly agreeably to the first example in the indenture for the county of Kent wherein the twelve persons named in the indenture are said to have chosen  eli∣gerunt  the  two knights  for the county and  four citizens  for Canterbury and Ro∣chester for it is manifest that the twelve persons named acted only in trust as a  com∣mittee  for the electors of the whole coun∣ty because the election is expressly decla∣red to have been made  ASSENSU TOTIUS COMITATUS ILLIUS  "By the assent of the whole county"  And in the  other example for the county of Wilts wherein only  twentysix persons  named in the indenture are said to have chosen  six∣teen representatives  viztwo knights two citizens and twelve burgesses  in one joint election  yet we must not consider the said twentysix persons as the only electors but rather as an  acting commit∣tee  empowered by the whole body of electors in that county for though the words  "assensu totius comitatus illius"  are omitted yet the beginning of the in∣denture expressly informs us that it was made "  in pleno com Wiltes tento  "In plain shire"  or  full county  meaning  a full countycourt "of Wilts holden"  c  " c And likewise it is not improbable that the said twentysix electors who are ex∣pressly named in the indenture with the sheriff but  "exaltera parte"  were con∣sidered as the  manucaptors  or  sureties  for the appearance of the  elected  which will account for their making the indenture  with the sheriff for no  manucaptors  are mentioned  as such  in these inden∣tures though the appointment and ex∣press mention of  manucaptors  were gene∣rally esteemed a necessary precaution in those ancient times of which more shall be said hereafter  The most obvious means of reforma∣tion are either to divide each county into so many equal districts as may most con∣veniently be represented by or de∣puties so as to include the whole number now sent from each county or else to  choose the whole number of knights citizens and burgesses by the joint suffrages of all the electors together at the countycourt  agreeably to the ancient examples already cited By these regulations indeed the boroughvoters might complain that they would be injured by losing a large propor∣tion of their borough Representation that is they would certainly lose that  unreason∣able proportion  of representation which is  injurious to the rights and freedom of their neighbours but they would be so far from losing any  just and equitable right  really due to themselves that they would actually gain thereby  a right  of voting for all the  knights  and  citizens  as well as for all the  other  deputed  burgesses  of their respective counties to which at present as mere burgesses of one borough they have no pretence The experience also of late years has shewn that it is become necessary to enforce the ancient laws which ordain that  both the electors and the elected  shall be  in eodem comitatu commorantes et residentes  "  In the same county dwelling and resident  "  That the knights of the Shires within our kingdom of England to be chosen to come to the parliaments from henceforth to be hol∣den should be chosen in every county by men  dwelling and residing in the same County c  And that they who are to be chosen be likewise

that they should appear at the day and place appointed in the writ some few of them now and then refused to find  manucaptors  whereupon  their goods and cattle  were  destreined to cause them to appear in parliament  at the time and place prescribed by the writs  c  Prynne's  Brevia parliamentaria rediviva  p So that men of known abilities and integrity howsoever fond of their own ease and private amusements might then be  compelled  to serve their country in parliament though their electors were also  compelled  to pay them wages and perhaps the renewal of both these antient usages would contribute much to the national welfare that useful talents of private gentlemen might neither be  unemployed  nor  unrewarded  in order to prevent such  shameful and unmeaning  secessions  from public business as have lately been made  by the gentlemen in opposition to mi∣nistry as well as by many who profess to be the ministers friends A parliament so far reformed viz by having  an equal representation of all the electors in each county  might be well qualified to con∣sider of some farther regulations to ren∣der the representation of the counties themselves  more equal  and  proportionate with respect to each other  according to the number of inhabitants For in an∣cient times ALL MEN in each county that were free howsoever poor enjoyed a share in the legislature which may be clearly proved by the very act of parlia∣ment  Henry VI cap vii Whereby the right of voting was limited  to those who have  land or te∣nement to the value of fourty shillings by the year at the least c  The preamble of this act however sufficiently proves the fact that all the common peo∣ple thought themselves entitled to vote at elections for knights of shires  Whereas the elections of knights of shires to come to the parliaments of our lord the king in many counties of the realm of England have now of late been made by ve∣ry great  outrageous  It is very easy to give hard epithets without proofs of their pro∣priety and truth  and excessive number of people dwelling within the same counties  c  of the which most part was of people of small substance and of  no value  The  value  of our Christian brethren before God both in church and state is inestimable For all Christians that are not convicted of crimes ought surely to be equally esteemed the adopted brethren of Christ and members of that everlasting building the church of God whereby they are entitled to  judge  not only of things in the present world but also in that which is to come For if they shall hereafter have authority even to "JUDGE ANGELS"  how much more things that pertain to this life  Cor vi For herein con∣sists that NATURAL EQUALITY OF ALL CHRISTIANS which some political writers aff  ct to deny  whereof every of them pretended a  voice equivalent as to such elections  to be made with the  most worthy knights and esquires dwelling within the same counties  whereby manslaughter riots batteries and divisions among the gentlemen and other people of the same counties  shall very likely rise and be  unless convenient and due  remedy  be  provided c  But the inconveniences here alledged for which the iniquitous  remedy  of depriving the common people of their right of voting at county elections was provided deserve to be no otherwise esteemed than as so many mere imaginary pretences to excuse the  injustice  of the act for if any such  man∣slaughter riots batteries  c had ever been really oc∣casioned by the former popular elections the framers of this act would not have failed to cite the examples for they could not say that any such mischiefs had ever happened before that time but only that they  shall very likely rise and be  unless convenient and due remedy be provided  whereas since their iniqui∣tous  remedy  hath taken place all  these baneful circum∣stances  do notoriously attend it though the framers of the act could not cite  a single example  of such mischief  before  that unhappy alteration It is therefore high time to repeal that act  which unjustly deprived them of that right  The nation has severely felt the bad effects of that unjust innovation wit∣ness the present iniquitous practices at  contested elections and the helpless and endless manner of adjusting them be∣sides the ruinous expence of influencing a majority when chosen which at pre∣sent is considered as a measure of  state necessity  and compare these modern corruptions with the happy manner of conducting elections in general for near two hundred years before that period as related by Prynne in his Brev Parl Rediv p  Sundry persons of eminency quality parts and wise∣dom  says he  in most counties  were elected  knights of the shire  by the unanimous consent of the gentry freeholders AND PEOPLE not only twice or thrice but times or more after another to serve in parliaments without any e∣mulation polling feasting or can∣vassing for voyces or future com∣plaints contests about their elections polls undue or double retorns which of late times have disturbed the coun∣ties peace and interrupted the par∣liaments proceedings there being not above two or three cases of elections questioned or complained of from Hen III till Edw IV for ought that appears by the retornes or par∣liament rolls and  not so much as one double retorn or indenture wherewith all the  LATE  bundles  Prynne wrote in the reign of king Charles II and the corruption hath notoriously increased since that time  of writs are stored and  the House of Commons and late Commit∣tees of privileges pestered perplexed  to the great retarding of the more weighty publick affairs of the king and king∣dom  Let it also be remembered that by the beforementioned unhappy deprivation of the common people's rights the king has lost the advantage of the proper legal balance against the dan∣gerous power of rich and ambitious men and overgrown landholders the fatal want of which has lately been most no∣toriously demonstrated in the unhappy ruined kingdom of Poland for as the authority of a king is amply sufficient to defend the common people from the op∣pression of the rich and great by a due exertion of the laws provided the com∣mon people be allowed  a due share in the legislature  so the latter in return and for their own sakes will always be ready to exert their  legislative authority  as well as their strength and power in  a  free militia  Memorandum A  militia  cannot be  free  if the individuals of it are compelled under the terrors of martial law to be withdrawn from their families their ordinary callings and even from their counties for six months or more without return for by these means they are  withdrawn  also from their  civil capa∣city in the state  and are apt to become  mere soldiers  or  mercenaries  for when a man loses his trade or ordi∣nary occupation together with his family and local connexions on which his maintenance depends he may justly be said to lose his  civil capacity  because he is thereby rendered dependent on his  military sold  or pay like the common  soldiers  of all standing armies and therefore whenever the public defence requires the  national militia  to form an army in the field the service ought to be supplied by a regular military  roster  or  rotation  circulating monthly in due and equal proportions throughout all the counties by which means no man would be so long withdrawn from his home as to be injured either in his family or occupa∣tion and yet the most distant parts of the kingdom would be defended by the returning disciplined troops and military vigour would be circulated by the  roster  like the blood of life throughout the whole body of the nation which would give it under God such in∣ternal strength as must render all attempts of foreign invaders fatal only to themselves  to maintain the king and the laws which by their union with the crown they will always be able to do whenever the aristocratical power re∣quires any just limitation  THE END  ANNUAL PARLIAMENTS The ANCIENT and MOST SALUTARY RIGHT Of the COMMONS of GREATBRITAIN  Being an Extract from SHARP'S  Declaration of the

 which at present is al∣most universally acknowledged to  be  necessary  as well for the security of the people as the dignity and safety of the crown The unhap∣py effects of modern deviations from

indeed chosen by a small part of the people of England yet the legal  Repre∣sentation  even of that small part was  out of date  and void from the length of time that the said Representation had continued  without Reelection  which was about ten years whereas it is well known that the due effect or  virtue  of popular  Representation  was formerly supposed to be incapable like some  an∣nual

of a Parliament in these words  For the maintenance of the said articles and statutes and redress of divers mis∣chiefs and grievances which daily hap∣pen  A PARLIAMENT SHALL BE HOL∣DEN EVERY YEAR as another time was ordained by a statute  Which Statute here referred to was made in the th year of the same reign cap  Item it is accorded that a Parliament shall be holden EVERY YEAR ONCE  and more often if need be  But Sir William Blackstone supposes that the King never was  obliged by these Statutes to call a  new  Parliament  eve∣ry year  but only to permit a Parlia∣ment to sit annually for the redress of grievances and dispatch of business  if need be  Com c p  It is too true indeed that our Kings in general did not think themselves "  obliged  by these Statutes" as they ought in conscience to have been for the safety of their souls  to call a  new  Parliament every year  nay it is certain that many of them would never have called a Parliament at all had they not been  "obliged"  by necessity and the circumstances of the times But by what authority could a representative in one Parliament take his seat in the  next an∣nual Parliament  without  reelection  before any laws were made for lengthen∣ing the duration of Parliaments And besides if the King did  only permit  a Parliament to sit annually  c  by what authority could the Parliament be convened at all under such a circum∣stance seeing that a  mere permission to sit  excludes the idea of a prorogation from year to year However the learned commentator himself very justly observes in a preceding page concerning "the manner and time of assembling" that the  Parliament is regularly to be summoned by the King's  Writ  or Letter issued out of Chancery  And  it is well known that these Writs are not addressed to the knights citizens and burgesses elected for any  former  Parlia∣ment but to  the Sheriffs alone  to cause  Knights Citizens c to be elected  for when the said Acts were made such an absurdity in politics had never been con∣ceived in England as that of trusting the  Representation  of the people for  a term of years  as at present to the persons elected On the contrary when the business of each Session was finished the Parliament of course was at an end and therefore Lord Coke did not speak in vain when he mentioned  "the excellent Law"    viz  the Act for  annual  Parliaments  being applied to the said Writs of Parliament  c before recited  A man of so much good sense learn∣ing and judgement as Sir William Blackstone is master of must be well a∣ware of the pernicious effects of investing  the Representatives of the people with a legislative power beyond the constituti∣onal term of A SINGLE SESSION without  Reelection  and therefore I cannot but be surprized at the unguarded manner in which he has expressed himself in his Comment on the two  excellent Statutes  of Edward III for  annual  Parliaments  viz  that the King is not  or ever was o∣bliged by these Statutes to call  a new  Parliament every year  c  He has caused the word  new  to be printed in  Ita∣lics  as if he meant thereby to insinuate that the Legislatures of those early times were not unacquainted with our modern idea of conferring on the popular Repre∣sentation a kind of  continued senatorial dignity  without  Reelection  for several years together whereas he certainly must have known that this corrupt  modern  practice has produced a  new order  of men amongst us a most dangerous increase of aristocratical power which was entirely  unknown to our Ancestors in the glorious reign of Edward III If he could shew that there  ever  was a Parliament in those times that was  not a  NEW  Parlia∣ment  his Comment might be justified But it is notorious that Writs were issued to the Sheriffs for  new  Elections almost  every year  during that whole reign The Writs for the most part are still preser∣ved with the Returns upon them In the catalogue of ElectionWrits which Prynne has given in his  Brevia Parlia∣mentaria Rediviva  p to there is an account of Writs issued for  new  Elections in every year of that King's reign be∣tween his th when the last Act for annual Parliaments was made and his th year except  viz  the th st and th years in which years the Records of Summons to the Prelates and Lords of Parliament are also wanting as appears by Sir William Dugdale's  per∣fect  Copy of Summons to Parliament of the Nobility  c  And yet this affords no absolute proof that Parliaments were not holden  in those very years  for which the Writs are want∣ing because the bundles of Writs for the said years may have been lost or mislaid The only wonder is that more have not been lost when we consider the very little care that had been taken of them for Prynne found many of these Writs dispersed among a vast miscellane∣ous heap of other records on various sub∣jects as he himself relates in his EpistleDedicatory to King Charles II of his  Brevia Parliamentaria Rediviva  cal∣ling the said heap a  confused Chaos  under corrding putrifying cobwebs dust and filth in the darkest corner of Caesar's Chapel in the White Tow∣er as  mere useless Reliques not worthy to be calendred  c  And in page of that same work he speaks of  Bundles of Writs whereof had only been then  lately  discovered filed and bundled by himself  But many of these Bundles  says he  are  not compleat  above half or three parts of the Writs being either rotted con∣sumed maymed torn or  utterly lost  through carelessness wet cankers or other casualties and some of them have not above two three or four Writs and one or two but one Writ and Retorn remaining  But that there were really Writs for Parliaments even in those  three  years which appear to be wanting at least in  two  of them is very certain because it was in the th year of this reign as Sir Edward Coke informs us Inst p that the Pope demanded homage for the kingdoms of England and Ireland and the arrears of revenue granted by King John to Pope Innocent III  whereupon the King in the  same  year calleth his Court of Parliament  In this Parliament it was unanimously agreed by the Prelates Dukes Counts Barons and  Commons  "et  la Commun  " and again  "et Communes"    that the said King John nor no other could put himself nor his Realm nor his People in such Subjection without their  Assent  'sans assent de eux' and if it was done it was done without their Assent  that is without the Assent of the  Common  for the Assent of the Barons was expressed in the Charter  and con∣trary to his Oath at his Coronation  p Where∣upon Lord Coke remarks in the margin that  no King can put himself nor his Realm nor his Peo∣ple in such Subjection without Assent of the  Lords and Commons in Parliament  c  c as Sir Edward Coke proves from the ParliamentRolls of that year N  o  remarking at the same time that the Act then made was "never yet printed" See the margin th Inst p  And it appears that a Parliament was held also in the th year of this reign because supplies were in that year granted to the King by Parliament as related by Sir Richard Baker in his Chronicle p  viz  in his eight and fortieth year  IN A PARLIAMENT is granted  him a th of the Clergy and a th of the Laity  So that there is but  one  year out of so many in which we cannot trace the meeting of the annual Parliaments And  annual  Writs for  new  Elections were regularly issued for the first years of the following reign as appears by Prynne's  d part of a brief Register and Survey of the several kinds and forms of parliamentary Writs  pages and till Rich∣ard II that wretched perjured monarch had rendered himself  absolute  His arbitrary proceedings very soon afterwards oc∣casioned his own Loss of Power and total Fjectment from the Throne so that notwithstanding his boasted  Firmness  in executing his favourite measures he was at last reduced to the most abject acknowledgements of his own unworthiness to reign  After considering these unquestionable evidences of the issuing Writs  annualy  for  new  Elections it will be difficult to comprehend the meaning of Sir William Blackstone's Comment on the said two  Acts for  annual  Parliaments  Not that he the King is or ever was obliged by these Statutes to call a  new  Parlia∣ment every year but only to permit a Parliament to sit annually for the re∣dress of grievances and dispatch of bu∣siness  if need be  These last words  says he  are so  loose and vague  that such of our monarchs as were incli∣ned to govern without Parliaments neglected the convoking them some∣times for a considerable period under pretence that there  was no need of them  c  But  "these last words"  are not  so loose and vague  as either to justify his own explanation of the said Statues  viz  not  to call a  new  Parliament every year but only to  permit  a Parliament to sit  c  or to excuse in the least degree the criminal neglects of those de∣praved monarchs who were inclined to govern without them for the words  "if need be"  cannot according to the most obvious sense of the Act wherein they are found be applied to the main purpose of the Act the holding  annual Parliaments  but merely to the remain∣ing part of the sentence  viz  and more often  that is  and more often if need be  The Order  that a Par∣liament shall be holden  EVERY YEAR ONCE  is absolute and the discretio∣nary power expressed in the words  if need be  relates apparently to the cal∣ling Parliaments  "more often"  for if the said discretionary words  "if need be"  could with any propriety be applied to the whole sentence the Act itself would have been nugatory which could never be the  intention  of the Legislature but the true meaning and sense of the Legisla∣ture is very clearly proved by the histories of those times for it is manifest not only that  new  Representatives were elected  e∣very year  with only one exception for a  considerable number of years after the last of the said Acts was made which confirms the main purpose of the Acts  viz  the holding  annual Parliaments  but it is also manifest that Parliaments were frequently holden  "more often"  than once a year  Writs were issued for electing  new  Parliaments in the th year of Edw III in his th year in his th year and even in his th year and there appear to have been  new  Parliaments in the th of Rich II See  Prynne's Brevia Parliamentaria Rediviva  p  which amply confirms al∣so what I have before said concerning the meaning of the discretionary power expressed in the said Act by the words  "if need be"  These very frequent Elections some∣times two three and four times IN ONE YEAR sufficiently prove that the power delegated by the people to their Representatives continued no longer in force than during the Session of the par∣ticular Parliament to which they were  summoned which being  once determi∣ned  says Prynne ist part of Brief Register  c  of Parl Writs p  they presently ceased to be Knights Citi∣zens Burgesses Barons in any succeed∣ing Parliaments or Councils unless newly elected and retorned to serve in them by the King's  NEW  Writs as our LawBooks  referring to Ed IV  f  Brook Officer Hen VIII c  "and experience resolve"  c And therefore Judge Blackstone's insi∣nuation against the calling of a  new  Par∣liament has no real foundation for if it was the intention of the Legislature in the two Acts abovementioned that the King should ever summon  any Parlia∣ment at all  they must necessarily be un∣derstood to mean a  new  Parliament on all occasions  i e  not only that the regu∣lar Parliaments which they ordained  to be  holden every  year once  should be  new  Parliaments but also those that  should be summoned upon any extraordi∣nary unforeseen occasions which is suf∣ficiently expressed in the st of the said Acts by the words  and more often if need be  The meaning of the Act is  unquestionably  proved by the actual issuing of writs to the Sheriffs for electing Knights Citizens  c  for  two three  and sometimes  four new  Parliaments  in one year  as mentioned above And if any person should object that such  very fre∣quent Elections  must be attended with in∣superable difficulties and inconveniences we may quote the experience of all an∣cient times as affording ample and suffi∣cient proofs to the contrary  there be∣ing not above two or three cases of e∣lections questioned or complained of from Hen III till Edw IV  that is more than years  for ought that appears by the Retornes or ParliamentRolls and NOT SO MUCH  AS ONE DOUBLE RETORNE or IN∣DENTURE wherewith all the  late  Bun∣dles or Writs are stored and the House of Commons and  late  Com∣mittees of Privileges pestered perplex∣ed to the  great retarding  of the more weighty public affairs of the King and Kingdom  Prynne Brevia Parl Re∣div p This enormous evil the retardment of business by undue Re∣turns will not I may venture without the spirit of prophecy to assert be reme∣died by the  new Regulation  for that pur∣pose The Commons were never in ancient times of Freedom esteemed the proper Judges of their own Elec∣tions but the  King  alone that is in his  limited  judicial capacity by his Justices and his sworn Juries in the Courts of CommonLaw If my countrymen will seriously consider all these points they must be convinced that the only sure method of healing the alarming distem∣pers  of our political Constitution  Viz  the enormous national Debt the numerous Pensions the secret parliamentary Insluence a stand∣ing Army of near Battalions of Foot besides Ca∣valry in time of Peace this was first printed in  c c c  which must render the  Estates  and  Property  of individuals precarious and insecure or finally EAT THEM UP with  growing burthens  if these fatal symp∣toms of the most dangerous  political consumption  are not speedily checked and thrown off by the wholesome pre∣scriptions of a  free and equal Representation of  THE PEO∣PLE  annually elected  is to restore to the people their ancient and just Right to elect a  new  Parliament  every year once  and  more often if need be  No Parliament could have any right to deprive the people of this inestimable Law unless the Representatives had ex∣pressly consulted their respective consti∣tuents upon it as the alteration was of too much moment to be intrusted to the discretion of any  Representatives  or  Depu∣ties  whatsoever being infinitely more important than  any new device  moved on the King's behalf in Parliament  for his aid or the like  for the most  essential and fundamental Right of the  whole body of the Commons  I mean the  Principals  not the  Deputies  or  Agents  was materially injured by the fatal change and the people's power of controul for the general good of the kingdom was thereby apparently diminished so that if it is the duty of Representatives even in  "any new device"  of mere  aid or the like  to consult their Constituents how much more upon the proposal of so material an alteration in the Constitu∣tion ought they to have answered that  in this new device they  DARE NOT AGREE WITHOUT CONFE∣RENCE WITH THEIR COUN∣TRIES  These are the words of Lord Coke who mentions them as the proper answer  See also the answer of the Commons in Edw III as reported in Sir Robert Cotton's Abridgement of the Records c p almost in the same words  when any new device is moved  c and he adds  whereby it appeareth  says he  that SUCH  CONFERENCE  is warrantable by th law and custome of Parliament  th Inst p so that no  Representative  can be justified according to  the Law and Custome of Parliament  who re∣fuses to receive the Instructions of his Constituents notwithstanding that seve∣ral very sensible worthy and I believe sincerely patriotic gentlemen have lately declared themselves to be of a  contrary opinion  but when they peruse the seve∣ral authorities which I have cited con∣cerning the absolute necessity of a  very frequent appeal  to the sense of  the whole body of the people  I trust in their can∣dour and love of truth that they will alter their sentiments  THE END
