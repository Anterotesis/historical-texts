THE RIGHT HONOURABLE The Earl of  Lincoln  My LORD  T  HE Fair Authress of the following Sheets being Dead and the Publication of them falling into my Hands I could not think of any PATRON under whose Protection they  might with that Advantage I de∣sir'd venture into the Publick so properly as your Lordship's For where better could HEROIC LOVE and all the PATRIOT VIRTUES find a surer and more auspicious Refuge than under that  Nobleman  's Protection whose distinguish'd Honour and good Sense has render'd him so emi∣nently capable of the  former  and whose  stedfast Zeal  for his Coun∣try's Service in the most dubious and difficult of Times has been so conspicuous to all that know any thing of our publick Affairs as that of your Lordship Yes my Lord that Heroic Firmness and Re∣solution you discover'd then in your Conduct has made you the pecu∣liar Darling of all true BRITONS of all Lovers of the best of Kings and Constitutions  Resolution  and  Uncorruptible Faith  are not  the common Growth of this Age which makes every Consideration yield to the poor an mean Pro∣spects of immediate and Personal Advantages either in Wealth or in Power and Dignities and few very few have been found whom neither the Malice and ungenerous Persecution of Potent and disap∣pointed Enemies could break nor all the gilded Baits of Power Riches Flattery Pleasure and the other cunning Arts of insinu∣ating into the Minds of the young and uncautious in which vile Arts those were no small Profi∣cients who had then the Publick Management of Affairs could corrupt or give the least shock to on whose Wiles tho' many were deceived by them your Lordship supported by a perfect Integrity and just Understand∣ing look'd down and despis'd  IT is such a Publick Spirit such an Understanding that qua∣lifies a Nobleman to be worthy of the Addresses of the MUSES For whoever loves his Country must be pleas'd to see ARTS Flourish which add to its Glory and its Felicity since that Coun∣try can only be estem'd truly Hap∣py and Great where ARTS as well as Arms find publick Encou∣ragement And of all ARTS POETRY is perhaps the chief which deserves the peculiar Care of the  Great  and the  Polite  IF we may decide this by what we find in History it is plain that whereever Heroic Fortitude and Martial Glory have found a di∣stinguishing Success there POE∣TRY has met with the greatest Indulgence  ATHENS  which polish'd Mankind by her POETS was able by her single Valour un∣der the Conduct of MILTIADES with Ten Thousand Men to de∣feat some Hundreds of Thousands of  Persians  ROME in her great∣est Glory and most establish'd Fortune became a Rival of GREECE in that  Noble Art  while VIRGIL HORACE VA∣RIUS TUCCA and many more found themselves the peculiar Fa∣vourites of the ablest Statesman and most illustrious Emperor that Nation ever knew  IT would be no difficult Mat∣ter my Lord to carry on the Proof of this in a less eminent degree through the several King∣doms that arose out of the Ruins of the  Roman Empire  even from  Italy  to  Hungary  but that would be a Work of too large an Extent for the narrow Compass of an Epistle By hinting his here I only aim at stirring up if possi∣ble a generous Ambition in our Great Men of distinguishing themselves in a manner so wor∣thy of Power and Dignity  I have known a Nobleman who I know not by what means got a popularity for his Genero∣sity who yet could only just∣ly pretend to an injudicious Profusion for he has given a Pi∣per Three Hundred Guineas when a MAN of LEARNING found but a very mean Gra∣tuity for a most valuable Per∣formance But several have in∣deed been bountiful to Fidlers and the  thrilling Throng  while we have found very few SIDNEYS  and SACKVILES since we have pretended to Politeness and yet the many Excellent Products of Poetry with little or no Encou∣ragement are a Proof that it is the natural Growth of the Clime and with a tolerable Cultivation might arrive at the greatest Per∣fection  THE following Sheets my Lord are of this Kind that is they are allow'd by the Learned to be a useful sort of POETRY tho' without the advantageous Har∣mony of Verse For as all POE∣TRY is an IMITATION as ARI∣STOTLE justly observes it is plain that all  Fables  are IMITATIONS of  Actions  which is the essence of both the DRAMATIC and EPIC POESIE  BUT this  Prosaic Poetry  is of as ancient a Date as the  Mile∣sian  Tales  which so charm'd An∣tiquity it self The Moderns since the Time of HELIODORUS have often vary'd their Form some Years ago they swell'd them into large Volumes but of late the general Tast runs for such as are compriz'd in a much nar∣rower Compass from whence we derive so many Books of TALES which have not yet fail'd of Suc∣cess These that follow in my Opinion fall not in the least short of the most excellent that have yet appear'd there being a Pa∣thetic Tenderness that runs quite through them supported by a Noble and Heroic Fortitude  THE Preface will shew your Lordship that their Foundation is laid on true History and the La∣dy has so artfully Grafted the Fiction upon it that the whole  bears the pleasing Appearance of Truth and Reality  If they contribute to the Di∣version of any Hour of your Lordship's more elegant Leisure I have my Aim My Ambition to give this publick Testimony of my Esteem and Value for your Lordship's singular Virtues would not suffer me to lose the first Op∣portunity of doing it unable to delay my Zeal 'till I had some∣thing more solid to offer though perhaps in Justice it is not the most unmeritorious Endeavour to con∣tribute to our Diversion and I hope it will be thus favourably re∣ceiv'd by your Lordship from  My LORD  Your Lordship's most Humble and most Obedient Servant  CHARLES GILDON  THE PREFACE  I  HERE present the Reader with some few of those many Transactions which made up the Lives of two of the most Potent Monarchs of the  Milesian  Race in that Ancient Kingdom of  Ireland  And although I have cloath'd it with the Dress and Title of a Novel yet so far I dare speak in my own behalf that I have err'd as little from the Truth of the History as any per∣haps  who have undertaken any thing of this Nature  What I have added is only the Love and Amorous Discourses of  Murchoe  and  Dooneflaith  whose Name I have presum'd upon since in the Chronicles and Writings of all those which I have read who have Treated on that Subject make no mention of the Name of  Maolseachelvin  's Daughter tho' none af them hardly but take no∣tice of the Story And finding in Dr  Ketrius  's  Manuscript  that of  Dooneflaith  to be in use at that time and if I mistake not to be the Name of her Mother I therefore was the more willing to imagin I should not err so much from Truth as if I had given her a feign'd one to give that to her Daughter  Some upon what Grounds I know not would needs have their manner and way of making Love  which I have brought as near as I could to our modern Phrase to be too Passionate and Elegant for the  Irish  and contrary to the Humours they alledge of so Rude and Illite∣rate a People when all the while they do not consider that altho' they may seem so now in the Cir∣cumstances they lie under having born the heavy Yoke of Bondage for so many Years and have been Cow'd down in their Spirits yet that once  Ireland  was esteem'd one of the Principal Nations in  Eu∣rope  for Piety and Learning ha∣ving formerly been so Holy that it was term'd  The Island of Saints  and for Learning so Eminent as all their Chronicles make out and some others who were not of that Nation as  Bede  in his  Hist Anglic  lib cap lib cap  Bede  and  Camden Brittan  p Edit Lond  in fol  anno  Cam∣den  do avouch for them  It was so Famous for Breeding that many from the adjacent Islands and most parts of the Continent of  Europe  came thither for it  Insomuch as  P Walsh  says in his Prospect of  Ireland  that when any were wanting from their own Country it came to be a Proverb  He is gone to  Ireland  to be bred  And another in the Life of  Sul∣genus  has this Distich  Exemplo patrum commotus amori legendi  Ivit ad Hibernos Sophia mirabile daros  And we find in their Chroni∣cles that there were Four Great Universities in  Ireland  viz  Ard∣magh Cashell DundaLeath∣ghlass  and  Lismore  besides many other Colleges of less Note else∣where and as  Keting  in his  Ma∣nuscript  has it in the Reign of  Couchuvair MacDonochoe  that there were no less that    Scholars at one time in one of those Universities  viz Ardmagh  and that they were the  Irish  in those Days who gave a beginning Abroad as some Writers say to the Schools of  Oxford  But it is most certain they did to those of  Paris  and  Pavia  and many other great Colleges of Learning in Fo∣regn Parts  And both  Camden  and  Ed∣mund Spenser  in his  View of Ireland  page    do acknow∣ledge  That our Ancestors in  Great Britain  learned the very form and manner of framing their Chara∣cter for Writing from  Ireland  From what has been said tho' not a Tenth part of what might be on this very account I hop'd I might have liberty to dress their words in as becoming a Phrase as  my weak Capacity could frame or the time that I did it in would allow  As for the other part of the Story it is all Historical and treads only the Path of the true Chronicle if we may give Credit to my Authors who are  Bede Camden Heylin Spenser Han∣mor Campion  Dr  Keting  Sir  James Ware Flahertus  and  P Walsh  I have I must confess omitted several Remarkable Pas∣sages and Twenty four of the Twenty five Battles which  Bryan Boraimh  Fought in his Reign and won but yet I have not foisted in any thing that might be injurious to the Truth in their Places and have only made a Compendium of Things as tho' done in four or five Years time which perhaps were Transacting half so many score  I have constrain'd my self con∣trary to the Custom of most who write these sort of Essays to make my Lovers die unmarried since I could find no Authority to the contrary And I should indeed have been very willing to have embrac'd the Opportunity could I have found any colour for it of making them after so many Mis∣fortunes to have ended their Trou∣ble in the Married Bed  Lastly since my Design in the beginning was to shew the strange means by which  Ireland  was once deliver'd from the Tyranny of  Turgesius  and the  Danes  by the Beauty of a Virgin I thought it might not be impertinent to the Story to make the same Maid tho' in a more vertuous way be the Instrument of saving it a se∣cond time by infusing of Courage into her Lover who we'll sup∣pose for her sake did things that  Day which almost surpass all be∣lief tho' at the same time she had little or no part it may be in the Victory This License I presum'd might lawfully be granted in a Novel  Irish TALES  L  ASTING and Ter∣rible were the bloody Wars which the An∣cient  Irish  sustain'd a∣gainst the powerful  Danes  who by their vast Num∣bers and continual supplies of fresh Men who Recruited them daily and were weekly landing at one Port or other came to their aid they being then Masters of the Sea so harass'd and tir'd the long defending Islanders that at last they were forc'd to submit and their Provincial Kings become  for some small space of Time Tributaries to the  Dane  Turgesius  the  Danish  Captain General being a Soldier of in∣vincible Courage and no less Ambitious made himself be stil'd Monarch of  Ireland  and with a Splendid and Magnificent Train of hardy and resolute War∣riors whom Peace and Idleness the Seeds of Wickedness and the Mildew of Vertue had ru∣sted into Courtiers kept his Court in the center of the Coun∣try at  LoughRibh  near that place where now stands the Town of  Athlone  He was a Man so skill'd and train'd up in Arms and Martial Fatigues that had he only fol∣low'd the Business he profess'd his Conquests and Victories might have been an everlasting Theme for Ages to come and had not his Lust like a Canker eaten away  the Inscriptions his Sword had en∣graven his Victorious Memory might to this day have been the enduring Song of Fame  Turgesius  having subdu'd the best part of the People of this Na∣tion nay indeed we may say all but a few who knew not how to bow their Necks in subjection to any but a lawful Prince or stoop to any thing beneath their free Liberties and Obedience to their own Kings had betaken themselves to Boggs Woods Mountains Rocks and inaccessible Places whose Wisdom and Con∣duct being back'd with an inimi∣table Valour in a few Weeks wrought out their own Infran∣chizements and broke the servile Bonds in which their fellow  Irish  were enslav'd notwithstanding the mighty Care and Circumspe∣ction  Turgesius  us'd to the contra∣ry for there was not a Hole or  a Corner much less a Town or a City in the whole Realm that was capable of it in which he had not planted a Garrison made as he thought secure by impreg∣nable Fortifications  All things being order'd in this manner he began to partake of the Pleasures of Peace which his long Toil and indefatigable La∣bours had newly establish'd Those cruel Wars which had o∣pen'd the veins of this distemper'd sick Kingdom had not yet drain'd one drop of his ill Blood which corrupting for want of usual Ex∣ercise made him degenerate from the noble Science of War to pra∣ctise that of Love and giving way to his unruly Passion be∣came in a short time wholly Conquer'd by the fair Eyes of  Dooneflaith  the Daughter of  Maolseachelvin  King of  Meath  This Lady was one on whom Nature had lavishly bestow'd all the Graces and Ornaments which could be to make Humanity ado∣rable she was so nobly endow'd and so incomparably Beautiful that to see her and not ad∣mire her was impossible yet was she capable of all the soft sentiments Love could imprint and had already devoted her Heart to a Man to whom without blame she might warrantably do being Prince  Murchoe  Eldest Son to  Bryan Boriamh  who was after∣wards Elected King of all  Ire∣land  This Prince matchless in his gallant Exploits was not less to be paralell'd in his Love it is enough to tell you he saw the beautiful  Dooneflaith  and conse∣quently lost his Heart in the sight but so much awe did her Vertue create in him that for some time  he languish'd in the Torments of his Flame without daring to ut∣ter one word of his Love and all the while the charming  Doone∣flaith  was subject to the same Malady  Thus for a Time did these two secret Lovers live in Hopes that Fortune would at some time or other be propitious to their Amours and altho' they were so enamour'd of each other yet dar'd not either of them shew the least sign of their Passion For now  Turgesius  made it his business to win the Heart of this Lady and  Maolseachelvin  himself was not the last who discern'd it nor could he any way forbid his Ad∣dress knowing how dangerous a thing it might prove to stand in competition with so mighty and powerful a King  Murchoe  was not insensible of it and to his inexpressible Grief was forc'd in  silence to bewail his Misfortunes and see all the Joy of his Soul Caress'd and Ador'd by another What Lamentations and Moans would he make when alone And what Grief would possess him when he fear'd that his charming  Dooneflaith  might in time consent to the Love of the Tyrant He became so Melancholy and Trou∣bled that the whole Court cou'd not but take notice of it and notwithstanding he us'd all endea∣vours to stifle his Flame yet he could not so closely conceal it but  Turgesius  for no Eyes are sharper than those of the Jealous perceiv'd it and under pretence that he suspected him to be Ill inclin'd to his Government Banish'd him the Province which was a far greater Punish∣ment to the young Prince than had he instantly doom'd him to Die  Dooneflaith  was soon made ac∣quainted with the Misfortune of  Murchoe  in which she took such part that she had much ado to refrain falling in a swoon before the King and was forc'd to feign an Excuse to get from his sight she went slenderly accompa∣nied having but two Maids who kept at a distance into a Garden at the farther end of which was a Grove whose melancholy shades seem'd fittest for her Condition and in which obscurity she might have free Liberty thinking no body by to vent her Complaints while her Women who seeing her sit down on a Bank retir'd to an Arbour hard by  It was not without much trou∣ble and many endeavours that she could find utterance for her words her sighs and sobs still hindring her Speech but at length having by large streams of Tears  which ran down her Cheeks al∣most drain'd the Channels of her Eyes she began to give ease to her Heart which without vent must have certainly burst  Oh unfortunate and mise∣rable  Dooneflaith  saith she whither wilt thou fly for ease since  Murchoe  the peace of thy Soul is banish'd thy sight and whose presence was the only stay of my Life what avails Life or Eyes to me now that dear Object's gone Surely this Tyrant who usurps our Throne has found I love the Prince and his Jealous Fears have drove him from the Court that he might also usurp a place in my Heart Oh  Murchoe Murchoe  cou'dst thou but know my Soul Oh that my sighs could reach thy distant Ears and make thee sensible of what I suffer for thee  While she was thus complain∣ing to her self e're she was aware  Turgesius  approach'd her and found her in tears just at the same time as  Murchoe  who be∣hind an adjoyning Hedge had overheard all she had said was going to throw himself at her feet but seeing  Turgesius  arrive he lay still as much pleas'd with what he had learnt from  Doone∣flaith  's own mouth as troubled and afflicted at the coming of so Potent a Rival who hinder'd him from making known to his Mistriss the sense that he had of her Goodness and the absolute Power she had gain'd over his Heart  Dooneflaith  was greatly sur∣priz'd to see one so near her whom she so much fear'd and had cause to hate she would have risen and left the Place to the King but was prevented  by his taking her by the Hand and throwing himself down by her she not yet well awaken'd from the lulling Cogitations of her dear  Murchoe  her beautiful Face all cover'd with blushes was forc'd to sit down by  Turgesius  who casting a look which signi∣fy'd how much he was concern'd for her Trouble desir'd her to tell him the cause of it ad∣ding if it lay in his power to give her Redress she had no more to do but command him  Dooneflaith  at the present was at a loss what Answer to make him 'till after several De∣mands she spoke in this man∣ner  My Lord said she you urge me to do that which I fear when perform'd will displease you 'Tis not but that I know the Honour you are pleas'd to confer on our Family in vouch∣safeing  to cast your Affections on me who so little deserve them nor is it but that I have confi∣dence enough in your Kingly Word that makes me thus scrupulous but so it is unless with an Oath you confirm that you will grant my Request I shall still keep the cause of my Grief to my self  Turgesius  was strangely per∣plex'd in his Mind to see one whom he thought he might have commanded make Capitulations with him and so much to distrust the Word of a Monarch that no less than an Oath would serve to confirm her He told her  That had she not gotten an absolute sway over his Heart he wou'd never have condescended to a thing the most powerful Prince shou'd never have gained from him in short he swore to her By Heaven and all his Pagan  Gods that whatever she de∣manded if it lay in his power should be granted upon Condi∣tion that she would allow him to love her and give him leave to hope that in time his Passi∣on might be rewarded  My Lord reply'd she you pretend to grant my request and tell me my Power is ab∣solute and yet you confine me to that which perhaps of all things in the World is opposite to my quiet as for your loving me it lies not in my power to hinder and as for your hopes that your Passion may be re∣warded is a thing I can wil∣lingly suffer so that you will not by your Power and Autho∣rity urge me to Marry you a∣gainst my consent and withall that you would recall the unhappy  Murchoe  whom I  know you have banish'd only for my sake  Turgesius  after a small pause answer'd her  Madam said he altho' your Father should command you to marry me nay tho' my Life and my fu∣ture Eternal happiness only de∣pended upon it yet will I al∣low you your own liberty nor ever Wed you unless you freely consent to it But as for  Murchoe  's repeal it wou'd indeed shew in me too much love but too little discretion for I know well Madam says he going on the  Prince  's Thoughts are too aspiring and that so long as he lives in the Province I must expect nei∣ther Peace in my Throne nor my Love for I have more suf∣ficient Proofs than bare report that he Rivals me both in your Heart and my Crown How  much cause have I therefore to to hate him especially now since you are so much interest∣ed for him I shall but take in∣to my Bosom a Snake that when warm'd again with my Favour will sting me to the Heart and with his Venom ran∣kle all my Peace and Tranqui∣lity however to shew you that I pretend not to your Love by that power the Heavens have put into my Hands I freely consent that he stay still at home nay even here in our Court and I shall admit him to use all his Art and make his Addresses to you so that I likewise may be heard in my turn  Turgesius  remained some time silent in expectation of her An∣swer but the blessing his Words had pour'd on her Heart was too mighty for her Tongue nor knew she how to return him the  Thanks which were due for so no∣ble an Offer without betraying too much of her Love but at last overcoming the conflict in her Soul she utter'd these Words  Most renowned Conqueror your Generosity and Goodness have so far wrought on my Heart that I fear there is no∣thing in honour you can demand that I shall have the ability to deny you And since it hath pleas'd you to leave all to my choice I make a farther refe∣rence of it to Heaven who I humbly implore to direct all my Actions and since so free∣ly you have told me your mind I will be as liberal of mine and here solemnly protest that  Mur∣choe  has never so much as o∣pen'd his Mouth or made known to me by any means whatsoever the things which you lay to his Charge  Turgesius  was pleas'd at these Words and took his leave of her with a promise immediately to re∣call  Murchoe  whom he told her he believ'd was not departed from Court it being yet within the li∣mits of the time appointed for his Banishment  Dooneflaith  return'd him such an answer as the Noble∣ness of the Deed did require she told him he had now took the right course to succeed in his Love but no sooner was he parted from her but she began to accuse her own Heart for what she had done and altho' it was only what her love for  Murchoe  had urg'd her to yet she could not but lightly condemn the way that she had ta∣ken to gain his Repeal she was too sensible there was no room in her Breast for any but  Murchoe  and that  Turgesius  with all his endeavours could never supplant the esteem she had for him and  withal vow'd in her heart that if once  Murchoe  shou'd mention his Love to give him such an an∣swer as should not displease him  Turgesius  had no sooner left her but at a small distance he espies  Dooneflaith  's two Women who at present he knew not and his curiosity pressing him to see who they were that were most melo∣diously singing to an Harp which they had brought with them into the Garden Musick being the chief thing that did of late allay the melancholly humour of their Lady he therefore retir'd under the covert of an Hedge that was by and had but just laid himself down to give attention to the Song but he espied  Murchoe  with his Sword in his hand  Turgesius  call'd to his Guards thinking he had some design on his Person but  Murchoe  dissipated those fears by throw∣ing Himself and his Sword at the  Conquerors Feet without so much as speaking one Word  Turgesius  who was now in a greater surprize to see his most mortal Enemy as he thought him in so suppliant a posture and not doubting but that  Murchoe  had had some private Conference with his Mistress was inflam'd with such Jealousy that with a fierce and angry tone he pronounc'd a∣loud these Words which  Doone∣flaith  plainly could hear  Ha Villain says he to  Mur∣choe  what rash and inconside∣rate Thing art thou whom Hea∣ven has so far deserted that thou sett'st thy Life at no higher a rate than thus to presume to approach one whom so justly thou hast made thy Enemy and thus darest to infringe those fa∣tal Orders I have given and thus by intrenching on the liber∣ty I have allowed thee for thy  two days stay to make prepara∣tion for thy Banishment and ta∣kest the privilege to interrupt the solitude of her whom my heart adores and thereby pull down thy sudden Undoing  Murchoe  heard these Threats with a Soul all inflam'd with Re∣venge but fearing the prejudice of his Mistress who now he began to hope held not his Life indiffe∣rent stifled at present his resent∣ment and tho' at any other time he had a mortal detestation of Flat∣tery yet now he thought it most expedient for the working his in∣terest with the divine  Dooneflaith  answer'd him thus  Most puissant yet haughty  Turgesius  that Title of Vil∣lain you gave me I renounce and had you been ten times my Conqueror would retort it back to thy Face had I not by accident and not willingly heard  how generously you intend to proceed it is not this misera∣ble Life I fear to lose nor is it that Heaven has so far deserted me that makes me Bow at your Feet nor is this posture I am now in so Suppliant as it is Thankful I bow thus low to  Turgesius  not that I fear the worst he can do but to return him my thanks for the freedom he gives me in once more seeing  Dooneflaith  and for the liberty he has granted to permit me to make my humble Addresses to her Now witness for me all ye Pow'rs above my Life my Honour nay what's more my very Soul I set at nought when She e'er stands in Competition I must confess and 'tis the first time I ever taught my Tongue to say it I Love I Love the fair the charming virtuous and all divine  Dooneflaith  but to  my everlasting Torment I love without expectance of return no were my hopes as great and high as Sinners new absolv'd I should despair since I have you for my Rival What Power have I dejected banish'd I when such a resistless Conqueror puts in his claim A Crown a Crown  Turgesius  I fear will dazzle her fair Eyes so glittering will the mighty Glory shine that she will look on no less light  Enough  Murchoe  says  Tur∣gesius  and as I conquer'd thee in Arms I'll Conquer in my Love henceforward I'll lay by my Crown that shall be no title to gain her nay more thus far I promise thee that I will ne'er demand her for my Wife nor seek her for my Bed on such a Price Love only shall be currant Coin and that I'll lavish to acquire my Ends take  then your Sword take my For∣giveness thy own Liberty and if thou canst take  Dooneflaith  I'll condescend so low to call thee Rival now and since un∣urg'd thou ownest thou lovest her thou wilt have punishment enough for all thy Crimes to see her circled by her own con∣sent within these Arms  By this time the Guards were come up and  Turgesius  in the sight of them and  Dooneflaith  who also was come up when he call'd to his Guards took  Murchoe  from the Ground and in the presence of them all pronounced his Par∣don and the freedom he allow'd him to make his Addresses to  Dooneflaith  Dooneflaith  was so taken with his generous Proceeding that she cou'd not withhold from giving him a thousand Praises which made him imagine he had no small  Interest in her Heart already and were as so many stabs in the Breast of  Murchoe  who now began to think that her pleading for his re∣peal was only out of fear that in his absence he might raise new Forces and so once more bring  Turgesius  's Life into hazard Af∣ter a walk or two in the Garden  Turgesius  making  Murchoe  take one of  Dooneflaith  's fair hands while he held the other they went in all together and now the whole Court was talking of nothing but the aspiring Love of  Murchoe  and the noble Condescention of  Tur∣gesius  Moalseachelvin  was at that instant with  Brian Boraimh Murchoe  's Father in consultation how they should shake off the tyrannous Yoak of this Usurper when this last adventure came to their Ears  Mo∣alseachelvin  from thence gather'd some hopes of accomplishing his  ends but  Brian  inwardly accused his Son of disloyalty to his Coun∣try who when he had the Tyrant alone at his Mercy prefer'd the love of  Maolseachelvin  's Daughter before that of his Honour and his enthrall'd Kingdom wherefore they both parted at that time without coming to any result  The next day  Turgesius  made his addresses to  Dooneflaith  but found his reception colder than he imagin'd wherefore sending for her Father he discover'd his Mind to him and contrary to his Pro∣mise and Oath to  Dooneflaith  com∣manded him to use his utmost en∣deavours to reduce his Daughter to accept his Love  Murchoe  taking the advantage of  Turgesius  's Permission went al∣so to  Dooneflaith  where he free∣ly open'd his Mind and discover'd to her all that he had heard from her the day before in the Garden  she saw it was now no time any longer to hide her affections and to the unspeakable joy of  Murchoe  confess'd that he had won so much on her heart that would their Pa∣rents consent she was willing to accept him for her  Husband  this was not so privately done but a Spy whom  Turgesius  had secretly plac'd there to that purpose made him acquainted with all that had pass'd which rais'd such confusi∣on in his Soul that he knew not how to be reveng'd on  Murchoe  nor what punishment to inflict on  Dooneflaith  but after many tor∣menting  Cogitations  was resolv'd himself to be a private Spectator and if that he found what he fear'd and was told him to be true to end  Murchoe  's Life with his own hand  Wherefore in a day or two af∣ter seeing  Dooneflaith  was inex∣orable to all his Intreaties he  seem'd to give over his Suit and now  Murchoe  had the greater li∣berty of prosecuting his Amours He had endur'd all the reproaches that an incens'd Father cou'd make him and had in vain solicited for his consent and altho' he found his Mistress and also her Father no ways averse but rather desir∣ing the Match yet to his afflicti∣on and sorrow he could see no pro∣bability of his happiness since his own Father stood so much against it No Prayers nor Intreaties cou'd move him and he had char∣ged him no more to visit  Doone∣flaith  upon that account  Murchoe  who had yet never known what Disobedience to his Father was and had never broke the least of his Commands now saw himself in a miserable condi∣tion either he must loose the love of his Father or that of his Mi∣stress both equally destructive to  him he resolves at last to follow his Duty in hopes that in time his Love thereby would prove more happy he fail'd not however to pay her his visits tho' with a Countenance less assur'd than be∣fore and she could not but ob∣serve the great alteration that was wrought in his Heart his Words bore not those soft and sweet ac∣cents they were wont nor did he put that joy on his Face as for∣merly he had She could not see so mighty a change but ask'd to be inform'd of the cause which with disjointed Words and heavy Sighs he at length told her  O Madam says he  with his Eyes flowing over with Tears  how unhappy is the wretched  Murchoe  since even the Heavens conspire to his Misery and but that I have reason to hope that I am not altogether indifferent to you I should not thus pine  and waste to my Grave but boldly at once leap o'er the bat∣tlements of Life and seek for a Death the nearest way  Dooneflaith  hearing him talk of Death took him by the hand and with a thousand soft charms in her Eyes tho' half drown'd in Tears said to him  O my Lord can any thing make your Life so burdensome that you would quit it so long as I love you can you thing of wound∣ing a Heart wherein I have an interest For so nearly ally'd are all your Sufferings to my self that not one drop falls from your Eyes but my Heart an∣swers with the like of Blood Say then my  Murchoe  what has befallen Has  Turgesius  gi∣ven you cause of Jealousy or do you think because I allow of his Visits which Heaven knows is not in my pow'r to prevent  or I would that I ever can con∣sent to his Love No no  Mur∣choe  not all the Diadems in the World not all the Monarchs on Earth shall put you from my Heart there you and none but you shall Reign but play not the Tyrant there and by  Turgesius  's Example take delight to spoil and ransack what I so freely give  Here her Sighs broke off her Speech and rais'd our Lover from the Exta∣sies her tender Words had cast him into  Dry up oh my Souls dear Treasure says he these preci∣ous Drops the moyety of which would largely expiate the Sins of all Mankind I know thou lov'st me and am prouder in that Title than were I Mo∣narch of the Universe but my Dearest Charming  Dooneflaith  thy Love alone but makes me  miserable since I must only see there is an Heaven but never be admitted to it My Oh  Dooneflaith  my Cruel Father has commanded me to Love no more no more to talk and spend my happy Hours in thy blest Company no more to sit and gaze on that dear Face no more to change soft Looks and Prattle with our Eyes the Se∣crets of our Hearts no more now must I wish for Night that in my Dreams my  Doone∣flaith  may delight me nor wa∣king in the Morning rise to make me blessed in my Visits to you  Turgesius  is all merci∣ful and good his Heart more soft and pliant than my Fa∣ther's or were it not with this Sword I'd  Here  Turgesius  came from the Place in which he had overhear'd all and was so transported with  his Rage that had not  Doone∣flaith  interpos'd  Murchoe  e'er he could have turned in his own Defence had been laid as a Sacri∣fice to his Anger dead at his feet nor had he the patience so much was he blinded with Pas∣sion to stay till he had call'd his Guards but enter'd alone un∣armed all but his Sword  Murchoe  was so lost in his Sor∣row that till he heard  Doone∣flaith  shriek out he saw him not enter and was ready to save  Tur∣gesius  the pains and have dy'd of himself when he saw his Mistress hold his Rival in her Arms then falling on her Knees still hold∣ing by his Robe and profusely showring down floods of Tears to save her Lovers Life  O  Tur∣gesius  my Lord my King and Conqueror spare O mighty Monarch spare my  Murchoe  's Life and in exchange I'll give  you this of mine kill not a Man the Gods themselves wou'd mourn to lose one whom their utmost Skill can never paral∣lell  Turgesius  by this time repented him of his entring alone know∣ing by that rashness that he haz∣zarded a Life his Love and a Crown against a Man most stout and much beneath him where∣fore going to retreat he was pre∣vented by  Murchoe  who by this time had got between him and the Door and stood ready with his Sword in his Hand to hinder his passage  Is this says he to him according to your King∣ly Word Do you esteem your Vows and Oaths so little Then Heaven refuse me when I beg its Mercy if I let slip this op∣portunity No Faithless Ty∣rant now I meet thee single come from thy Buckler there  and meet me fairly now show thy Valour and preserve thy Life by taking mine for all the Powers above have joyn'd consent that one of us must fall  Turgesius  could no longer listen to his threats but disengaging himself from  Dooneflaith  he cry'd out  Good Gods if Inso∣lence like this to me who am thy King shall 'scape without its just Reward and go away unpunish'd let every School∣boy whip me with a Rod and may the Women brand me with the hated Name of Cow∣ard  Die Traytor goes he on making a stroak at him  since one of us must fall take a Death too glorious for so base a Villain from thy Monarch's Hands  Here they both engag'd in Fight but  Dooneflaith  fearing  the loss of her lov'd  Murchoe  catches hold of  Turgesius  's Arms by which means she gave  Mur∣choe  opportunity to get within him and disarm him  Now Sir says  Murchoe  but that I scorn so poor and base Revenge and would not use the advan∣tage given me by a Woman I'd ease the Kingdom of its Thraldome and free my self from a perfidious Rival 'Tis she alone that vertuous lovely Lady whose presence charms my Hand from giving thee that Death which thou deservest O Madam says he turning to  Dooneflaith  how inglorious have you made my Name that had you given me leave might have resounded through the World and born the Title of its Countrys Saver  Ireland  should then have had its native Liberty again and I perhaps  been chose their King proud only in that Glory to lay my Crown beneath your Feet  Turgesius  with a dauntless Front told him how much he was indebted to  Dooneflaith  who had not only Repeal'd his Banish∣ment but had now given him the advantage over him He told him withal how base and mean insulting was and bid him since he was in his power to use him as he pleas'd but charg'd him still to be mindful how he got the Victory so much he boasted of  Murchoe  cou'd no longer endure the thoughts of making use of the Advantage given him against a single Man threw  Turgesius  his Sword and bid him use it once more But  Dooneflaith  ran to him and with Tears in her Eyes besought him to desist but nothing could prevail and had not some of the Courtiers and  Guards who by this time were come to the place hearing the clashing of Swords prevented by disarming the valiant  Mur∣choe Turgesius  had a second time fall'n under his Mercy for just as they had seiz'd on him  Turge∣sius  's Sword broke short to his Hand  It was not without many com∣mands that  Turgesius  himself cou'd hinder the enrag'd Soldiers from taking  Murchoe  's Life and cut∣ting him to pieces even before his Mistresses Eyes who now pleaded in his behalf so persua∣sively that she obtain'd of the Monarch his Liberty of Life with Condition that he forthwith left the Kingdom  Murchoe  after what he had done was glad at present on any Conditions to get from the malice of the enraged  Danes  wherefore without so much as taking his Leave of  Doo∣neflaith  he fled from the Court but not being willing to leave his Native Soil by which he knew he should utterly be depriv'd of all means of serving his Mistress whose absence now ran more in his Mind than all his other Mis∣fortunes his Life became in two or three Days so cumbersom to him that he was resolv'd either to lose it or free it together with all  Ireland  of the Tyran∣nous Burthen it bore To which end he posts to  Armagh  where∣of  Turgesius  was quickly inform'd and at four several times in one Month caused Fire to be set to that City to drive him from thence Nor did he spare either Monastery or Church that stood in his way lest he should take Sanctuary in them He likewise put to Death all their Priests and plac'd Heathen LayAbbots in every Cloister Nor did his fury  spare either Sex or Age whom he thought favour'd his Conceal∣ment  The poor afflicted  Dooneflaith  spent all her Nights and Days in most cruel condolement for the loss of her  Murchoe  nor could all the fair Promises or large Of∣fers  Turgesius  could make win her to bestow on him even to his own Face any other than the Title of Tyrant in hopes that thereby she might raise his Cru∣elty to that pitch as to give her a Death which next to the Love of her dear  Murchoe  would now be most welcome unto her  Turgesius  's Love now became so fierce and unruly in his Breast that nothing but the Enjoyment of  Dooneflaith  could allay it or give him one moment of ease he resolv'd in himself nothing should  impede  his Desires where∣fore he once more sends to her Fa∣ther  Maolseachelvin  to use his Au∣thority with his Daughter and make her more pliant to his Love or that all who belong'd to her should feel the weight of his An∣ger and know how fatal the Consequence should be in case she refus'd and did not come willingly into his Arms he had left off his Addresses to her after having found her impregnable and waita while for an Answer from  Ma∣olseachelvin  Some days pass'd and the un∣fortunate  Dooneflaith  began to entertain hopes that the Tyrant had quitted his Suit and that her ill usage of him had banish'd his Love she had now time enough to bewail her Misfortunes and miss'd not a Day in which she went not to the Grove in the Garden to ease her sorrowful Heart by Complaints One Day among the rest she was got into  an Arbour where having wea∣ried her self with her Grief soft slumbers seal'd up her Eyes and laid her to Sleep and in her Dreams she imagin'd she saw  Murchoe  all bloody come into her Room and give her a thousand Reproaches of being unfaithful then pulling a Sword from under his Robe he would have pierc'd his own Breast at the sight whereof  Dooneflaith  started out of her Sleep in such an Agony that she was not her self in an hour or two after But having well consider'd 'twas only a Dream and the Fancy of her Distemper'd Brain she fell to complaining again  Oh merciless Powers said she how long will you make me the Mark of your Anger why O relentless Heav'ns are you so Cruel Oh ease me of my Misery or Life For what un∣known  Offence do you afflict me thus Thus Rack and Tor∣ture one who always to the utmost of her Power has been Obedient to your holy Wills which even now amidst this Mass of Woe I willingly sub∣mit unto All I request is but one farewell sight of him I love next to your selves let him but once more bless my Eyes and I shall die contented  No sooner had she utter'd these words but she saw at the entrance of the Arbour one in a Womans Dress who at first view she knew not but recollecting her self she perceiv'd to be  Murchoe  Thanks bounteous Heaven said she now my Prayers are heard this Charitable Act has cancell'd all your former Cruelty wellcome my Love  says she running to take him in her Arms but how was she surpriz'd to see him shun  her soft Embraces and stood ga∣zing on her as tho' he had never seen her before  Ah  Murchoe  says the charming Maid is it thus you requite all my Suffer∣ings Can my Embraces be thought troublesome or sure I do mistake and this is not my Love but some illusion that does wear his Face and come to mock my Miseries  Murchoe  was so astonish'd at his suddain Happiness that he could scarcely believe what he heard or saw and  Dooneflaith  was so much alter'd with her continual Pineing and Grief that he scarce knew her But his Sen∣ses assuming their former strength he ran to her and fell at her feet where he vented such a flood of Tears and so many Sighs that he was not able for some time to utter one word while the passi∣onate  Dooneflaith  fearing he was  grown unkind or jealous fell down by him in a Trance  Murchoe  not minding where he was and what hazard he ran of discovering himself and con∣sequently of losing his Life call'd out for Help naming himself a thousand times over to have been the unfortunate fatal Cause  Oh  Murchoe Murchoe  said he what hast thou done Oh I cou'd stab my Heart tear all my Limbs and gnaw my very Flesh for being thus rash Cursed be my Life and blasted be my Hopes which thus have made me take on this Disguise O  Dooneflaith  my lovely Dear my charming Saint look up look up thy  Murchoe  calls more miserable now than are the wretched Damn'd Oh ye Inhabitants above look down and lend your aid recall the  parting Life of her whose Loss will make this Kingdom Poor  Dooneflaith  by this time co∣ming to her self again gave him a Sign that she liv'd by a Groan  O blessed sound said he what Musick dost thou make in my Heart such a sad accent co∣ming from my Love at any other time wou'd rend my ve∣ry Soul but now since 'tis the Messenger of Life 'tis more Melodious than the Songs of Angels are repeat it once a∣gain and bless my EarsHa says  Dooneflaith  where am I What superOfficious Hand hath brought me back to Life What more than savage Beast could be so cruel to awake me from my long Eternal Sleep  But opening her Eyes and seeing  Murchoe  she alter'd her Note and gave Heav'n a thousand thanks for their Kindness and ask'd  him forgiveness for what she had said  He had yet no power to An∣swer nor wou'd his Kisses per∣mit her to finish what e'er she began and to their mutual Con∣tent and Satisfaction they spent some time in the silent Oratory of their Eyes where each so feeling∣ly did tell such Stories as Words cou'd ne'er express  Murchoe  was the first who broke silence and return'd her a million of Thanks for the interest she had taken in all that he suffer'd they made a thousand new Protestations of Lo∣ving till Death and gave each other firm assurances of future Fi∣delity They were parting with Promises to see each other as often as they could when  Maolseachel∣vin  her Father enters taking  Murchoe  not minding his Face which he took care to conceal for one of his Daughters Women let  him pass by without the least sus∣picion  Maolseachelvin  told  Doonefla∣ith  that she must prepare for in three Days he had promis'd  Tur∣gesius  to send her unto him ac∣company'd with fifteen other Virgins as a Victim to allay the Fury that her Obstinacy and  Murchoe  's Treachery had rais'd in his Breast He stay'd not to receive any Answer but went forwards to perfect the Walk he intended and to think of the Pro∣ject that was working in his Brain  No sooner was he out of sight but the afflicted  Dooneflaith  be∣took her to the Arbour again and throwing her self on a Bank she vented her Sorrow in this man∣ner  Oh Cruel Barbarous Fa∣ther said she and have you at length consented to a separation  'twixt me and my  Murchoe  to become the Wife of  Turgesius  But that I can easily hinder Besides he has Sworn he will never Request it but by my permission which I will sooner grant to Furies to hurry me to Hell No inhuman Parent tho' you and all the World wou'd grant me His yet if none else will Death shall for∣bid the Banes But if forget∣ful of his Oaths he forces me to Wed him ev'n in the Ty∣rant's sight I'll Pierce my Heart and spurt the reaking stream full in his hated Face  Murchoe  having seen  Maolse∣achelvin  quit his Daughter and observing her to retire back into the Arbour follow'd after her to enquire what her Father had said But in what a Consternation was he when as he entred he beheld her tearing her lovely Hair and  imprinting the marks of her Rage on her beautiful Face and giving such stroaks on her tender Breast as were enough to force Life from its seat  Murchoe  ran to her and put a stop to her Hands which surely else had ruin'd so much Beauty as none but she could ever boast of  Oh unkind  Doone∣flaith  said he to her what new afflicton has befall'n my Love that thus she seeks to spoil the fairest Temple Beauty ever fram'd  Oh  Murchoe  replies the despairing  Dooneflaith  leave me to my self my Griefs are catching and with its black Contagion will infect thy Soul Heaven has not yet left pouring down its Wrath and what a∣lone was meant for me may fall on you the Gods above have mark'd me out a Subject for their utmost Cruelties My FatherOh I blush to call  him so forgetting me forget∣ting Honour and himself has giv'n me o'er into the Tyrant's Hands but Three Days time I have allow'd to mourn the loss of thee my Love and everlasting Happiness  How short says  Murchoe  and fading are poor Lover's Joys For but some Moments since I thought my self in Heaven and whilst infolded in my  Dooneflaith  's Arms I thought no Misery cou'd e'er approach me Then what a Fall is here flung down at once from that stupendous height and dash'd in pieces in the lowest Hell Oh  Maolseach∣elvin  whither is all thy Glory fled How canst thou conde∣scend to give this Gem to one who knows not half the value of it  While they were thus condo∣ling their hard fortune and say∣ing all the soft things Love could inspire them with  Moalseachelvin  returns and hearing his Daugh∣ter's Voice in the Arbour enter'd and found our Lovers Arm in Arm in which posture they had resolv'd to end their Lives toge∣ther and never part but go Hand in Hand to Death Which had not her Father entred and snatch'd the Dagger out of  Mur∣choe  's Hands had been effected  Murchoe  seeing  Maolseachelvin  could not forbear discovering him∣self to him and giving him a thousand Reproaches for yielding to the Tyrant's will  Maolseach∣elvin  was amaz'd to find him in Company with his Daughter and in such a Dress but having re∣solv'd with himself what to do he thought it but Wisdom to con∣ceal it till some fitter Season  Wherefore not minding what  Mur∣choe  said to him he ask'd his Daughter if she had consider'd well of what he had told her  Most Honour'd Sir reply'd the weeping  Dooneflaith  can I admit such Thoughts as those your self nay Heav'n must Curse me if I do What Wed a Tyrant one whose wicked Hands have ransack'd all our Holy Temples demolish'd all our Altars burnt all our Chur∣ches and raz'd our Monaste∣ries Ravish'd our Nuns slain our Pious Priests and thrown the very Sacred Host it self to the Dogs whose Tyranny has Murder'd our Nobles and fir'd our Towns and Cities Can such an one be thought a Match for her whom you with Pious Care have taught to hate Oh rather Sir upon my Knees I beg it take back this wret∣ched  Life you once bestow'd me  No Daughter answers  Ma∣olseachelvin  'tis not to be his Wife for that's a Name which blasts the Lover's Joys he'd have you only for his Concu∣bine use you a while and then return you back you have ta∣ken Care he ne'er shall be your Husband by the Oaths you've made him swear and in Re∣venge he is resolv'd to have youhis Mistress reply'd  Doone∣flaith  hastily "Oh Heavens my Father sure is Mad his Reverend Heart o'erladen with its Fears has banish'd Sense from thence What be the Tyrant's Mistress You can∣not sure have such a thought as that you say but this to try my Resolution O have some pity on your wretched Daugh∣ter add not more misery unto  my troubled Breast already overburden'd with my Woes  Maolseachelvin  could hardly re∣frain from Tears to see the sad Condition his Daughter was in however he goes on and laid be∣fore her the Power of  Turgesius  and that if she did not willingly consent he would have her by force  Think says he to her how you cou'd endure to see a loving Father Murder'd before your Face for that and more he swears to do if you consent not to his Love he vows when he has had his Will which all the Powers above he is re∣solv'd shall not hinder he'll give your Body to the vilest  Danes  and let the meanest Soldiers use you as they please Then think again how happy thou may'st live how High and Glorious sit on  Ireland  's Throne if by  your Love you sooth this Migh∣ty Monarch  Murchoe  who all this while stood Thunderstruck to hear these im∣pious urgings of her Father cou'd no longer forbear uttering his Mind with Eyes sparkling with Anger he stept up to him  And can  Maolseachelvin  says he then become so base Can he whom  Ireland  's Hopes are fix'd upon degenerate from his Vertuous Noble Ancestors and from a Prince become a Bawd unheard of Wickedness a Pan∣der to his Child 'Twill can∣cel all my former thoughts of Vertue and make me think thou never didst beget her for surely such a pure untainted stream cou'd never rise from so impure a Spring Or were you ten times over her Fa∣ther if it were possible she shou'd not now obey I with  these Hands wou'd sooner give her Death my self  No Ambitious Vainglorious Boy answers  Maolseachelvin  it is not in thy Power to give her Death or save thy Life  So calling to two young Gentle∣men who waited without and whom he had won to his Pur∣pose and had promis'd in all things to follow his Directions he commanded them to lay hold on  Murchoe  and then went on  Now see rash Youth says he how Fatal 'tis to play with Thunder whose Bolt has fal∣len and crush'd thee to the Earth I'll send thee bound in Chains along with her which Act will doubly gain  Turgesius  's Heart  Dooneflaith  seeing them seize on  Murchoe  ran to him and ta∣king hold of his Arms would have stop'd him but her Father  loosing her hold she fell upon her Knees and with a Torrent of Tears besought him to save the Life of  Murchoe  Do with me says she what you please give my unspotted Honour to the Tyrant's Lust Brand me with Infamy but save this Noble Youth  Yes Mistress answers her Father your Honour is un∣spotted when in your Arms I found the lusty Lover for thy sake only tis he now shall die O Good Gods cries out  Doo∣neflaith  where shall the Inno∣cent fly for Refuge if you neg∣lect protecting them Am I the wretched Cause that he must bleed Oh Heavens I thought it was not in your Power to add to what I felt before but now my misery is doubled on me Oh dearest Father have you quite  forgot all pity abandon'd all remorse Can you suspect me guilty of so foul a Crime and let me breath I that till now you always counted good Wit∣ness ye allknowing Powers how guiltless I am of this blasting Calumny by all that's Holy Just and Sacred  No Lustful Heat e'er warm'd my Virgin Breast  Bate but that Thought and I'll forgive the rest  Then look upon his Youth his hopeful Noble Youth and pity his Misfortunes he knows no Sin unless vertuous Love be such O dearest Father I con∣jure you save his Life by all the Charms which Honour can inspire by my dear Mothers Soul by all your hopes of  Ire∣land  's Future Happiness and  by the Glory you shall win by this good Deed release him strait let not me beg in vain you was not us'd to see me thus in Tears upon my Knees and yet refuse to grant me my Re∣quest  Murchoe  seeing  Maolseachelvin  so obdurate to all her Intreaties fell likewise on his Knees  Be∣hold said he with Tears the humble  Murchoe  suppliant at thy Feet who begs not to pre∣serve his Life but your dear Daughter's Honour send her away and lay the blame on me I'll own 'twas I who bore her from hisArms then to ap∣pease his Wrath let me be sent unto him I'll willingly endure his utmost rage and count my Life well spent to save her Vir∣tue  Oh no dear honour'd Sir says  Dooneflaith  first send me  to his Arms where you will only lose a Woman's Life my Ver∣tue cannot suffer so long as there are means to stop my breath or when the Letcher comes all fir'd with Lust I'll cool his Veins by letting forth his blood or at the worst I'll drown him in my own  Maolseachelvin  could no longer hold out but running first to his Daughter then doing the like to  Murchoe  he took them both into his Arms and wept a flood upon their Necks  Right virtuous Pair said he whom Heaven has sent to make me happy in my latter days my loving Chil∣dren both forgive the Tryal I have made Now witness for me all ye bless'd above I hold ye equally as dear as Life as Ho∣nour or my precious Soul and since I find so well you Love each other curs'd be that Man  who would untie this Knot Now wipe your Tears away as I do mine tho' sprung from different Causes yours from your Sorrows mine from migh∣ty Joy stifle your Grief as I conceal my Vengeance Make thee his MistressNow Heaven forgive me if I would not sooner damn than harbour such a thought I for my dear lov'd Daughter's honour would set at nought my sweet immortal Soul No  Dooneflaith  no Genereus  Murchoe  I have so contriv'd it she shall be sent to him and as he writes to me here shewing them the Letter wil∣lingly has also commanded me to send him Fifteen young Virgins of our Noblest Blood to slake the burning lust of his Chief Officers I'll send them too But since so well thy Wo∣mans Dress becomes thee thou  shalt be one and Fourteen Youths as Bold and Valiant as thy self shall go all clad and dress'd like thee with each a Sword beneath their Gowns I have sent to those who have taken shelter in the Woods Mountains and Boggs to be in readiness and have a Thou∣sand Men who at the Signal given shall fall upon his Guards Letters already I have dispatch'd to every City in our Country to bid them Rise on such a Night  When you are entred and they all deep in Wine frolick and gay their Bloods all boyl∣ing hot secure each one his Of∣ficer by Death I'll trust my Daughter with the Tyrant's Fate strike home my Girl and dip thy Dagger to the Hilt then let him take his fill of Love Caress and Court thee  then But now we must dis∣perse and you  Murchoe  till after to Morrow which is the appointed Day shall lie con∣ceal'd in my House these Gen∣tlemen who are my trusty Countrymen and well approved Friends shall forthwith to the scatter'd  Irish  and get 'em to an Head then lead them like a Torrent on our Foes  They all swore Secrecy and departed only  Dooneflaith  and  Murchoe  were not separated till it was late but went together into her Chamber where to their in∣expressible satisfaction and mutu∣al joy they Supp'd together and passed away the hours till Bed∣time then  Murchoe  was Con∣ducted into an Apartment by him∣self where he spent that Night on the thoughts of the past Days Adventures and the important  Affairs they were to perform in a short time after  The next Morning  Maolseach∣elvin  sent a Messenger to  Turge∣sius  promising according to his Commands that he had won on his Daughter to obey him and that as he hop'd for his Kingly Favour hereafter he would not fail upon the Morrow Night to send her accompany'd with Fif∣teen Virgins more who were al∣so willing to run the same Fate and participate of the Joys their Mistress should receive in so splen∣did an Entertainment  Turgesius  was almost ravish'd with this News for certainly no Man ever lov'd or rather lusted to the degree he did he was re∣solv'd to have lost the whole King∣dom but he would enjoy her his eager Joy sat heavy on his Heart for Love is most impatient on Crown'd Heads But finding her  come thus easily he spar'd not for any thing that might make her Reception Magnificent He sent for Fifteen of his Chiefest Commanders and told them what a Treatment he had for them In short the whole Court was almost new model'd the Rooms adorn'd with Rich Beds and the most Costly Hangings  Never was Palace so galantly set out with Gold Jewels and Tapestry as this not any thing below the Dignity of Silver and that curiously wrought and Mas∣sive was us'd in any of the Chambers Cloth of Tissue was the meanest Furniture they had the Candlesticks were Gold so that all the Wealth those Sacrilegious  Danish  Heathens had despoil'd the Churches and Monasteries of with all the Plunder they had ta∣ken at Sacking of Towns and King's Courts were all now  brought to this Palace so that it might be said That one Spot of Ground held more Wealth than all  Ireland  besides  Nor were the Wines but of the Richest and all the variety of Viands which could be procur'd were sent for to this Place and every one was employ'd in some Office or other and the King with his Commanders almost Mad for the arrival of the happy Night their longing impatience thought that almost an Age which was only but twenty four Hours  The Hour at length arriv'd and  Dooneflaith  set out with a Noble Train of suppos'd young Virgins whereof Fifteen of them were of the most Handsome and yet most Stout and Resolute Youths of  Ireland  as well and gloriously Dress'd as Hands Jew∣els and Art could effect it each having one or two others to attend  him as his Servant or WaitingWoman in the same Female Ap∣parel and each a short Sword un∣der his Gown  Turgesius  went about a Mile out of his Court to meet them as soon as he had news of their approach accompanied with Fif∣teen of his Choicest Comman∣ders some whereof he had sent for out of strong Cities wherein they Commanded who also had with them an equal Train of Atten∣dants  The first interview of the two Parties was such a Sight as might have equal'd if not exceeded that of  Alexander  when he met  Thalestris  and her  Amazons  up∣on the Banks of the  Euphrates  It seem'd as tho'  Mars  himself had led the Van of all the other Gods to meet with  Venus  and the Female Deities  Turgesius  and all who follow'd him quite forgetting their Gran∣deur and Martial Habitude de∣scended from their shining Gild∣ed Chariots and went to those of the Ladies Nor had  Maolseach∣elvin  spar'd Cost to make his Daughters Equipage more Mag∣nificent and Glorious than any that  Ireland  had seen before especially that of the Charming  Dooneflaith  which was so Richly Furnish'd that at a distance in the glittering Sunbeams it was too Glorious to be lookt upon and struck a sort of Blindness in the Spectator's Eyes who beheld it She was drawn by six milk white Horses Caparison'd with Trappings of Gold an the Chariot wherein she rode was open having Rich Embroider'd Curtains held up by young  Cupids  who seem'd well pleas'd and smiling at the Deity  that they attended nor were the others much less sumptuous  In short who e're had been to see the first Greeting could not but have been astonish'd at so No∣ble a Sight  Turgesius  as tho' he had long practis'd the Art of Love so behav'd himself that even  Dooneflaith  was mov'd with Compassion at the great Action she was to perform However she seem'd as eager to reveive his Caresses as if she had met with the Man whom her Soul a∣dor'd After some few Compli∣ments had pass'd on either side the Women having by this time alighted to meet the Men they all mounted again the Monarch taking  Dooneflaith  into his own Chariot and the other Com∣manders following his Example did the like with those who came with her  And now being Pair'd they set forward for the Court all the way that they rode they were diverted by Trumpets and WindMusick which in their turns made a Seraphick Harmony But that which most of all Charm'd the Ears of the Warriours were the soft and melting Expressions the counterfeit Ladies did use which were so ravishing and ten∣der that not one of  Turgesius  's Train but could willingly have wish'd to have pass'd by the Ceremony of Supping and have gone immedi∣ately to their Chambers even  Turgesius  himself thought the time tho' spent in his Mistresses Com∣pany but irksom and long so eager was he to have the sweet Charmer in his Embraces  But Supper being ended the description whereof would but delay the recital of things more  material they prepar'd for their Beds and  Dooneflaith  was led up by the suppos'd Maidens who came with her to the Chamber that was assign'd for the Mo∣narch He being impatient for the dear happiness his Soul so much long'd for thought them too tedious in undressing her and putting her to Bed being no longer able to defer the happy moment disarm'd himself below as all the rest of the Comman∣ers did laying their Arms on a Table in the great Hall went each to his Chamber expecting the coming of Her he had chose But  Turgesius  no sooner entred his Room for he came alone than he was seiz'd on and immedi∣ately gagg'd that no outcry might be made they had certain∣ly kill'd him had not  Murchoe  interceeded who told him he now paid him back a Debt that  he ow'd him ever since he was so generous to save his Life formerly from the outrage of his Soldiers and Guards who were ready to have cut him in pieces when he fought with him in  Dooneflaith  's Apartment in retaliation of which he wou'd now save his Life from the threatning Swords of those who justly thirsted for his Blood  Turgesius  was not a little sur∣priz'd at the unlook'd for Adven∣ture but above all at the gallant Generosity of his Noble Enemy and incens'd Rival he would have made him such an Answer as suited the greatness of the Act had he had the liberty of speak∣ing But now his Heart was so troubled at the loss of  Doone∣flaith  and all his ravishing hopes were so blasted that Life to him was but an unnecessary thing he began tho' too late to think  how dearly he must pay for his Lust and how pompous the So∣lemnity had been made for the bringing on his utter Destru∣ction  The thoughts of the loss of a Crown came crowding upon him and he could not but be sensible what a lasting Infamy this Action must lay on his blind and inconsiderate Credulity How would he in his Mind Curse the time that he first saw that Char∣ming Seducer and now beheld her with more Detestation and Horror than heretofore he had done with Love and Pleasure  But we must leave him to him∣self and return to the rest who after the seizing  Turgesius  had no better success than their King unless ending a miserable Life might be accounted some mitiga∣tion of their Misfortunes The Signal was presently given out of  the Court Windows to the small Army that  Maolseachelvin  had brought to the Gates and all those Attendants and Servants who came with his Daughter were in a readiness to give the Onset to those in the Palace  Turgesius  and his Train no sooner rose from the Table but the inferior Commanders and Of∣ficers were set down to it each with one of those under Women who came with  Dooneflaith  the Bowls of Wine were going mer∣rily about and the  Danes  who are potent in  Bacchus  's Bat∣tles were too busie and the Mu∣sick too loud to let them hear  Maolseachelvin  when with his Arm'd Men he forc'd his way in∣to the Palace and they were greatly surpriz'd when they saw a whole Band of stout  Irishmen  well Arm'd enter the Hall It was now no time to demand  what they meant for e'er they could scarce turn about to see who they were they met with their Fate  A greater Confusion was never seen the Tables were all over∣thrown and the Blood of the  Danes  with that of the Grape promiscuously mingled made a purple Deluge on the Floor nor was there a  Dane  that Night in the Court who found not his Death except  Turgesius  the Ty∣rant who was reserv'd for a more ignominious and miserable End  Nor had this Great Underta∣king any worse success in the o∣ther parts of  Ireland  for those Towns and Cities whose Gover∣nours were slain at the Feast more bloody than that of the  Centaurs  hearing of the loss of their Commanders and their King lost with them their Courage and  yielded an easie Victory to the brave  Irish  who in a short time after releas'd the whole Kingdom from the slavish Tyranny of the  Danes  to their Lawful Subjection under a Monarch of their own which was by the consent of the Nobles plac'd on  Maolseachelvin  for the gallant Exploit he had done for then their Monarchs were Elective and with good reason the Choice fell on him  Now the  Irish  had thrown off the  Danish  Yoak and were again at Liberty each enjoying the be∣nefit of Peace which was intro∣duc'd by a most bloody and furi∣ous War Nor was there a  Dane  left in the whole Country but such who they us'd as their Slaves and put to mean Offices and those who were before so busie in demolishing and burning of Churches and Monasteries were now employ'd either as Smiths  Carpenters or Masons in their Rebuilding and the ChurchLands were all restor'd to their proper uses The LayAbbots whom the  Danes  had plac'd there were cast out of the Cloisters and slain and the whole Kingdom be∣gan once more to Flourish in Christianty and was establish'd in the true Worship of God  It is necessary e'er we proceed any farther to give a step back and see what became of our Lo∣vers and the depos'd Usurper who some time after his Defeat was led about the Streets thro' which so often he had rode in Splen∣dor and Triumph now Manacled and loaden with Chains and be∣came a scoff and derision to those o'er whom so lately he Triumph'd and in this Condition with a shouting throng of the Vulgar was he conducted to the River  LaughAinme  into which he was  cast and finish'd a burthensom Life by being their drowned  Our two Lovers had now as they thought no other Obstacle but the consent of  Bryan Boriam∣he  Father to  Murchoe  who they hop'd would agree to their Marriage The Valiant  Murchoe  in that Night's great Action ha∣ving shifted his Womans Apparel put on the more becoming one of Arms and flew like Lightning to assist his Countrymen leaving the care and safeguard of  Doone∣flaith  to her Father and it was some days e'er he return'd but to his great misery for now  Maolseachelvin  having the pros∣pect of a Crown in his sight and having stomach'd  Bryan  's denial of their Marriage before was firmly resolv'd that interest should not bring him to consent to it now Wherefore going to his Daughter and taking her into  his Closet he Commanded her on her Duty no longer to think of her Lover but when  Murchoe  return'd to use him as one who was most indifferent to her  Oh dearest Sir says  Doone∣flaith  can what you say be true Can he who sav'd my Honour and redeem'd his mourning Country be thus hard∣ly us'd by me He save thy Honour and redeem his Coun∣try replies her Father in an an∣gry tone did you your self did I and all the rest of the brave Princes of this Land do no∣thing Hear what I say and for your life obey me for what I have design'd no Prayers or Charms tho' drest in the best Garb of Eloquence adorn'd with all the Tears and taking Looks thy Beauty can put on tho' on thy Knees thou follow'st me a∣bout thou shalt not shake or  move my fixt resolve If when  Murchoe  shall return with ea∣ger Joys to run into thine Arms with frowns and scorns avoid his soft Embraces give him no Answer but disdainful Looks or here I swear I'll stab him be∣fore thy Face  Oh Reverend Sir says  Doo∣neflaith  recal that cruel Oath how can you think this Heart that is all Love all soft and tender to the noble  Murchoe  can teach my Face to put on such disguise Cou'd I consent to shew my Filial Duty and obey my Eyes would soon be∣tray my Heart and tho' my words were cold and all unkind yet they would shoot such fiery Darts as would declare they were but counterfeit my very Eyes spight of my best efforts would talk and tell the tenders of my Soul each interrupting  sigh I give will bear no consort with my Tongue  By Heaven says her Father do as I command shew but one amorous glance one heave one pant or sigh and I will blind those telltale Eyes of thine and give thee truly cause to sigh by giving him his Death Sure Sir replies the weeping  Doone∣flaith  you cannot mean the thing you speak You say it but to try my Love a second time which by the Gods is still the same it was when in the Gar∣den you made the former Test No Minion says  Maolseach∣elvin  I do it not to try thy Love which I'm too sensible is true I do it to revenge his Fa∣ther's Scorn who would not give consent that he should Wed thee when I was a private Man nor shall he now I'm  King therefore once more ob∣serve what I command  And must the innocent  Mur∣choe  says she who always dear∣ly lov'd me and sought not Heaven with more earnest Pray∣ers than he sought me be pu∣nish'd thus for his unkind Fa∣ther's Fault Oh Sir reverse your cruel Doom if not for his sake yet for mine nay for your own for if I share an interest in your Heart 'twill grieve you sure to see your only Daughter die when with one word you may preserve her Life What quit my Love now after this Misery and Trouble we have pass'd through for it now grow unkind when he most merits Love and after all those Sacred Oaths and Vows those thou∣sand Protestations which even in your hearing I have made to  Love him ever now to recall that sacred Breath and hurl damnation on my perjur'd Soul  I ask you not says he to break your Vows but meet him as I now command you that his proud Father may be humbled and fall a low Petitioner for the Love he once rejected  A thousand Blessings sit upon your Head says she and make your Crown more glorious than all your Predecessors were those healing words have cur'd my bleeding heart now I will call you dear and loving Father kneel and adore the very ground you go on use what severity you please against his Father but let my  Murchoe  not be put in pain let me not see him ra∣ther till his suppliant Father begs your pardon for certainly to see him as you bid me will  prove so fatal that twill break his Heart  Trifle no more replies  Maol∣seachelvin  but punctually obey my will I see them yonder en∣tring the Court and once more swear if that you fail in any Point I have enjoyn'd you you ne'er shall meet him more but in the Grave  After this he left her and went to his own Chamber no sooner was he parted but  Dooneflaith  looking out at the Window be∣held her dear  Murchoe  with his Father just entring the Palace and not being able to think on the severe Injunctions her Fa∣ther had laid on her without a torrent of Tears and a thousand imprecations on her unkind Stars  O barbarous Father said she to her self more Tyrannous and Cruel to thy Child than Sa∣vage Monsters are to those they  hate not see my Love but with disdainful looks not give him one kind glance for all his Love not one kind word of thanks for all his pains this Cruelty exceeds all precedent my unkind Speech or Eyes will do the fatal Work and leave no business for my Father's Sword O that some Angel would in∣struct my Love and tell him that my Eyes and Tongue are Lyars that my poor Heart bears no consent to what they say tell him I am all over Love and that my  Murchoe  is more precious to my Soul than all the World besides  Murchoe  and his Father with several of his Friends were now come into the outward Court of the Palace and casting his Eyes up to the Window he beheld his adorable Mistress who no sooner saw him but withdrew from the  Place which  Murchoe  thought was done to haste to him  Oh Father says he almost Exta∣sied look how the Treasure of my Soul does fly to meet my longing Arms now all the Blood I've lost in  Ireland  's Wars will largely be Re∣warded  Bryan  took such part in his Sons Transports that he could hardly forbear shedding Tears of Joy But  Murchoe  lest he should be outdone in kindness made what hast he cou'd into the House and at the end of the Hall beheld his fair  Dooneflaith  whom he ran unto with all the speed his Love could make  Oh thou charming soft and lovely Maid said the transported  Murchoe  let me upon thy tender Breast breath the soft languishments of my o'er flowing Joy  But how did he start and look amaz'd  when he not only saw she met him not half way but shun'd his Arms and after a small pause with gazing Eyes he thus went on  What my  Dooneflaith  says he are my Embraces loathsom grown What dost thou turn away the warming Sunshine of thine Eyes not one kind look to crown thy  Murchoe  's Victo∣ry not one soft word to bid him wellcome home  Doone∣flaith  could no longer turn away her Head yet was afraid of her Father who through a secret place look'd into the Hall and beheld her with frowns and fear∣ing she should not perform what he bid her her Love and she must part for ever cast so dis∣dainful and scornful a look upon  Murchoe  that he clapping his Hand to his Heart cry'd out  O Gods those cruel piercing  Eyes have stab'd my Soul and given me a death my boldest Enemies could never do  Then after a little stop he went up to her and would have taken her by the Hand but she refus'd it him  telling him the unkindness of her Father had destroy'd their Loves and that now he had fallen from his Promise and had com∣manded her no more to look on him with Amorous Eyes in pursuance to whose will she did from thence forward forbid him to visit her  Murchoe  during her talk stood like one without Motion nor had he the power to utter one word till he saw her departing the Hall but then running 'twixt her and the Door he fell on his Knees and beg'd her for her former Love to hear his latest words but she overcome with the pitiful sight being no longer able to look on  one in that woful Condition and one whom contrary to her will she her self had made so return'd him no Answer but snatching her Hand out of his which e'er she was aware he had seiz'd without so much as looking back she went out of the Hall and left the Disconsolate  Murchoe  on his Knees  He continu'd in that posture till she was gone out of sight then rising on his Legs again he drew forth his Sword and had ended his Life on its Point had not his Father and Friends who expected no less stept in and prevented him  Oh Cru∣el Father say he to  Bryan  this last unkindness outdoes all you you have done to me before why would you have me live when Life's so great a burden Were it not better I at once gave up my breath than live in  lingring pain and deal it out by sighs O Faithless Woman says he a little after thou ab∣stract of Inconstancy where's now that charming Voice which with kind Protestations swore  Murchoe  should ever be her Souls delight farewell a long and last farewell for with your cold disdain you've blasted all my Hopes and now no remedy is left but Death  With much ado at last they got him home to his Chamber but twas not in their power to get him to Eat or take the least refreshment and it was a long time before his Father could get him to promise to use no violence on himself to which he would never have consented had not  Bryan  told him he would use all his Endeavour to alter  Maolseach∣elvin  's Resolutions  No sooner was his Father gone out of the Room but he com∣manded all who were with him to do the like and after two or three hasty turns in the Chamber he flung himself on his Bed where he pour'd out such Tears such Sighs and Complaints that he drew moisture from the Eyes of all who look'd in at the Key∣hole of the Door to see what he did But now let us return again to our History  Soon after all things were set∣tled in Peace the Victorious  Ma∣olseachelvin  was as is said before by the Election of the Princes and Nobility of  Ireland  deservedly made King of  Meath  and then Monarch of the whole Country when there arriv'd three Brothers out of  Norway  viz  Amelanus Cytaracus  and  Ivorus  with their Families and great Trains who in a most Amicable and Peace∣able  manner pretending to be Merchants obtain'd leave for the better carrying on their Traffick and Trade to build three Cities near the Sea side which was per∣mitted them upon Condition that they paid Tribute for them Articles of Agreement being con∣sented too on both sides they fell to Work and erected the three Cities now call'd  Dublin Wa∣terford  and  Limrick  which they had no sooner finished and had made almost impregnable by strong Fortifications but the  Irish  began to see their Error and now it was that they felt the Power of an Enemy no less prejudicial in all appearance than that they had lately subdu'd  These Seaport Towns giving entrance to fresh and numerous Fleets of  Norwegians Danes  and  Oostmans  insomuch that the  Irish  were forc'd once more to  have recourse to their Arms And here it was that  Maolseachelvin  's Heart became mollified and once more gave consent when the Kingdom should be freed of its Foes that  Murchoe  should Marry his Daughter  The two Lovers had now ad∣mittance to see each other and with a bleeding Heart the Charming  Dooneflaith  made known to her dear  Murchoe  the reason why she us'd that severity to him at his return from the former Battle  Murchoe  lov'd too well to think any of the fault was on her side and was now the most happy Man in the World Her Father the King made him his General but the Occasion was urgent and he was hasted away having scarce time to take his Leave  However he had with a thou∣sand soft and passionate Speeches already parted with  Dooneflaith  and was now come to  Maolseach∣elvin  who receiv'd him with all the expressions of tenderness that could be  Go Valiant Youth says the King to him go and return Crown'd with Laurels of Victory revenge the hard Usage you have suffer'd on those barbarous Infidels for∣give my Rashness and believe I now set no difference betwixt thee and my own Child No my dear Son for so henceforth I will call thee and tho' your Father shun all my Advance∣ments I thus will embrace his Son Go then Victorious  Murchoe  Head our Men my chearful Soldiers long to see their Chief they think the time you lose in my embraces an Age in their impatience  Now mighty Monarch says  Murchoe  to him you show'r such Blessings on my Head  give me such Courage and such Hopes that if I Conquer not let me hereafter bear the Cow∣ard brand the Power you give me united with the thoughts of my  Dooneflaith  shall make me Conqueror where e'er I go and sweep your numerous Ene∣mies from off the Earth  After many endearing Discour∣ses  Murchoe  took Horse and went to the Army who wellcom'd him with loud shouts of Joy and where he found such Stout and Resolute  Irishmen  that whereever he came he carried Victory on his Sword's Point while his Father  Bryan  no less fearing the loss of the Kingdom again in the Southern parts of the Country did such things as would almost seem incredible and in a short time was Crown'd King of  Mun∣ster  still Conquering where e'er he went and soon after subdu'd  one half of the Nation Nor did he put a stop to his irresistable Force till he was publickly E∣lected and made Monarch of all  Ireland  the Nobility and Princes deposing  Maolseachelvin  to make way for  Bryan  giving him leave to live which is the greatest mi∣sery that can befall a Monarch af∣ter the loss of a Diadem  Bryan  now being King of all  Ireland  thought himself suffici∣ently reveng'd for the slights which  Maolseachelvin  had put on his Son and commanded  Mur∣choe  to come home to his Palace which then he kept at  Tomond  to the unspeakable trouble and af∣fliction of the two Lovers who now were taking as they fear'd their last leaves of each other  Oh my adorable Saint says the afflicted  Murchoe  to  Doone∣flaith  how unfortunate have all my Undertakings been How  Cruel is my Fate that now when I thought my Happiness beyond the reach of any Mis∣fortune I find it dash'd by that which I hop'd would have been its chief stay Now my  Dooneflaith  my miseries come rolling upon me and soon will overwhelm me Oh insupport∣able Cruelty I must leave my Love leave her good Heavens defend I fear for ever But witness Gods and all you Saints above though absent from my sight I'll ne'er forget thee Hopes once to bless me with thy sight again shall buoy me up through all my Sea of Sorrows if my dear Love but promise to be constant  Dooneflaith  could not hear him make such a scruple without shewing how much it touch'd her Heart  Oh cruel  Murchoe  said she do you take part a∣gainst me And if I will be constant Barbarous doubt have you thus long beheld me stand the shock of all Misfortunes even when Ambition and a Monarch's Crown would have shook the most firm and con∣stant of our Sex and can you make that scruple now If I'll be constant Oh Heaven that If will stab me to the Soul you've found the only means next to your hating me that could undo my peace you al∣most tear my Heart up by the roots what doubt an Heart like mine that is made up of nothing else but Love and Con∣stancy But I forgive Thee  Mur∣choe  I know 'twas but the overflowings of thy tender fear and the excess of a too power∣ful Passion and to confirm my  dearest  Murchoe  's Mind bear Witness for me now Oh all ye Gods and show'r upon me all your dreadful Vengeance if what I say be not sincere and true when in your absence I forgot my Faith either in thought or deed either for Threats or all the Proffers in the World if from this Heart  Murchoe  be ever absent then let the Furies tear me Limb by Limb and Dogs and Wolves devour my scatter'd Carcass  No more says  Murchoe  I believe my Saint and ever shall retain these precious words in the chief Records of my memo∣ry  They were forc'd soon af∣ter this to part but with such languishing and dying looks as if they ne'er should meet again how many times did  Murchoe  go to the Door and then return  again loath to depart printing his soft Lips on her fair Hand and she as often wish'd they might dwell there for ever they sighed and wept then wiped their watry Cheeks making ex∣change of Hearts at eithers Eyes at last as though both their words had been prompted by one Soul they together cry'd the Gods preserve and ever be your Com∣fort  Murchoe  having taken his leave went directly but most heavily towards his Fathers Palace in  Tomond  call'd  CeanChoradh  where he was welcom'd by  Bry∣an  and the whole Court but what were all the welcomes in the World to him since his  Doo∣neflaith  's Voice was wanting in the Consort the Musick was not sweet or charming he wholly bent his Thoughts on her and  Day or Night she was the sub∣ject of his Mind tho' he was ever accounted Devout yet now the welfare and happiness of his afflicted Mistress threw him on his Knees almost each hour  His Father and the whole Court could not but greatly wonder at this mighty Change he grew Pale neglected Meat and Sleep walk'd all the Day in melancholy places seeking recesses where the hunted Beasts scarce dar'd to enter they were so dark and dis∣mal where with his folded Arms across his troubled Breast he'd vent the Griefs which rankled at his Heart  Into one of these Places was it that his Father one day follow'd him and having privately listned to his usual Complaints when the poor Prince had thrown him∣self down extended on a rugged  Rock his Eyes like Rivers which had broke their Banks pour'd forth a flood of Tears with Groans and Sighs which almost rent the Vault  How Happy said he to him∣self had  Murchoe  been had Heaven been pleas'd he should have perish'd in his Countries Ser∣vice his loss perhaps would then have touch'd his Fathers hardned Heart he would have then perhaps shed one Tear and with a sigh have pitty'd his untimely End But now he thinks I breath he thinks I live when as alas these signs I give of Life are but the To∣kens of uneasie Death for I am Dead to all the World insen∣sible of every thing but Love and tho' I move and sometimes walk about 'tis but my more substantial Ghost  He was going on when  Bryan  interrupted him  What  Mur∣choe  said he is the Cause that thus thou spendest thy Youthful time in Cells Thus pine and like a Woman drown thy self in Tears Thus leave the migh∣ty Business of the World and bend thy Thoughts on a fanta∣stick Trifle Thus shun thy Friends and seek these solitary Shades Rouze up for shame awake thee from these Idle Dreams thy Father bids thee and a King Commands thy bleeding Country wants thy aid Ambition should methinks inflame thy Heart and banish Love from that too noble Seat Make thy self worthy to be my Successor what can the spright∣ly  Murchoe  lie dissolving in Tears when all the Land is al∣most drown'd in Blood Think  on a Crown think of a Mo∣narch's Power and see how poorly Love will shew to these or were those out of reach and that thy Hopes stood not so fair as now they do think on thy Honour and thy future Fame  O sacred Sir replies the Prince can you behold these ruines of your Son Look on and see him sink in sorrow and not extend a Parent's Hand to help him O Sir remember you your self was young Lov'd and Ador'd and knew no hap∣piness but in my Mothers sight I do but tread your steps walk in that Path which all the World goes once say but  Dooneflaith  shall be mine and you will raise me unto Life again without Her Honour Titles Pow∣er nay even a Crown it self  have nothing Charming in them  Bryan  could no longer hear him sue in vain but told him if he would take Arms and shew himself once more in the Field and according to his wonted Cu∣stom come home laden with Vi∣ctory he would so much indulge his Love that if after this he still continued in that Humour he'd use his utmost Power to make him Happy  The Prince overjoy'd with this Promise went home with his Fa∣ther and in a few days after Headed a brave Army against his Country's Enemies Victory still follow'd wheresoe'er he fought and his Courage and Conduct were not a small cause of the Re∣nown and Glory that accru'd to his Father For 'tis Remarkable that  Bryan Boraimh  defeated the  Danes  and their Confederates in Twenty five bloody pitch'd Bat∣tles he was accounted one of the most Puissant and Noble Mo∣narchs of the  Milesian  Race and tho' he liv'd not to see these Inva∣ders quite expell'd the Kingdom yet he fought in the last Battle that gave them their Overthrow having in his Life time reduc'd the Kingdom especially towards the latter end of his Reign to so tranquil and quiet a State that  Ireland  was become all peaceable and flourishing Nor were there to be seen any  Danes  but such who liv'd quietly under his Go∣vernment and were either Mer∣chants Handycraftsmen or Ar∣tificers who had their chief Re∣sidence in  Dublin Weixford Wa∣terford Cork  or  Limerick  and tho' they were a considerable Number of them yet not so ma∣ny  nor so Potent but that he thought should they at any time Rebell he could Master them at his Pleasure  Murchoe  seeing no Comfort ac∣crue to him in all this general Joy for he alone was excluded the benefit of Tranquility the whole Nation pertook the Con∣quests and Honour he won added more Trouble to his Soul since he could not yet obtain his Fa∣ther's Consent he avoided as much as he could the Pleasures of the Court and betook himself wholly to the Country where in unspeakable Torments he wa∣sted his time in Complaints But being one day near the House of  Maolmordh Mac Murchoe  his Un∣cle whose Sister by name  Garm∣laigh Bryan  his Father had Mar∣ry'd he thought to pass some time in a Visit to him and was very kindly receiv'd  But  Bryan  having an occasion for Timber for the finishing some Ships he had begun especially some Masts he sent to his Bro∣therinlaw  Maolmordh  to furnish him with them to which he con∣sented partly out of fear to deny him and partly for Kindred sake he went himself to see them cut down and assisted with his Men those who were sent for them in the getting them over a Moun∣tain to which they say some difference happening amongst the People he put his Hand to him∣self and in the action broke off the Gold Clasps that fastned a rich fring'd Mantle of Silk which  Bryan  had sent him At length he with his Nephew  Murchoe  came to  CeanChoradh  But no sooner did he arrive at  Tomad  and had gone to his Sister  Garmlaigh  's Apartment to give  her a Visit and acquainted her how he came to break off his Clasps which he desir'd her to get mended again for him but in a rage she threw the whole Mantle into the fire and burnt it reproaching him with meanness of Spirit in so unworthily sub∣jecting himself and his People of  Linster  whereof he was King to '  Bryan  altho' he was her own Husband  How basely said she be∣comes it the Blood which thou sharest with me to fear the dis∣pleasure of any much less one who has made himself my equal by taking me to his Wife How much below the Honour and Dignity of the King of  Linster  is it thus like a Bonds∣man or Slave to lend thy assist∣ance and like a Coward grant whatever he demands from thee  These words tho' at present he made her no reply sunk deep in his Heart so taking his leave of her he went into the Presence where he found a Nobleman and  Murchoe  playing a Game at Chess  Maolmordh  being touch'd to the quick with the Reproof that his Sister had given him and no lon∣ger able to stifle the sense he had of his Fault advis'd him who was playing with  Murchoe  on some Draught which lost his Nephew the Game  Murchoe  who had not been us'd to receive such Indignities for it was done in so palpable a manner as he could take it for no less being highly displeas'd told his Uncle  Maolmordh  King of  Linster  in a deriding man∣ner  That if the Advice he had formerly given to the Rebel  Danes  been no worse they had  not so easily lost the Battle at  Gleaun Mama  yet notwith∣standing his mighty Policy he could not win them the Field  Maolmordh  being stung with this jear in a fury reply'd  How∣ever my Advice succeeded at that time the next that perhaps I shall give to the  Danes  shall prove better to your Cost  So in a discontented Humour was departing when the Prince  Mur∣choe  told him  It should never break one moment of his Rest to countermine what ever Pro∣jects he could design and with∣al told him he defy'd him  Whereupon the King of  Linster  retir'd to his Chamber and would not although he was sent for by  Bryan  come down to his Sup∣per but flinging himself on his Bed pass'd all that Night in the extreamest anxiety of Spirit that  could be imagin'd and early the next Morning before any of the Court were stirring takes Horse and posts away for  Linster  where his Heart was so full what with the rebukes his Sister had made him and the defiance his Nephew had given him that he had no way to ease it but by giving if he could a stint to their Inso∣lence by making them to know that they had rouz'd a sleeping Lyon whose Fury and Rage should not be allay'd by any thing but their utter destruction  The next day he assembles the Chief of his Nobles and the Gen∣try and represents to them the Indignity that had been put upon them in the Person of their King and so aggravates the Matter that he drew them all to his side and made them all on fire to re∣venge it by throwing off their  Allegiance and Fidelity to  Bryan  and joyning their Power to that of the  Danes  and in return to the the Challenge that  Murchoe  had made him to send him ano∣ther  Having gain'd his Designs at Home he flies with all speed to  Dublin  and there engages the chief of the  Danes  to send away instantly to their Master the King of  Denmark  for a strong and powerful Supply to pull down the Grandeur and haughty Pride of  Bryan  and to destroy their and his most mortal Enemies which on the word of a King he promis'd to perform would they be assistant  While Messengers were sent over into  Denmark  he returns Home again where with all the hast he could use and most inde∣fatigable pains he prepares for a  War nor was it long e'er he goes to  Dublin  again where at his arrival two of the King of  Denmark  's Sons  Carolus Knu∣tus  and  Andreas  his Brother Landed at the Head of twelve thousand  Danes  which they had brought along with them whom after he had kindly receiv'd and refresh'd them well he forth∣with knowing delays in such Ca∣ses would be dangerous and give his Enemies too much time to Unite by an Herald sends  Bryan  a bold Defiance daring him to meet him in a spacious Field at  Clantarf  within two Miles of  Dublin  Bryan  had no sooner receiv'd this Challenge but making what speed he was able joyn'd together all the Forces of  Munster Connaught  and  Meath  for those of  Ulster  he sent not to them  being unwilling to stay till they should come up and believing he had Power enough out of those other three Provinces to encoun∣ter the Enemy  The Prince  Murchoe  his Son was sent to those in  Meath  where he once more got a sight of his charming  Dooneflaith  and whom after the success of the Battle he had a Promise from  Bryan  his Fa∣ther that he should Marry  Never did two faithful Lovers meet with such Joy and  Doone∣flaith  even blest the Causers of this War which had made her so happy with the presence of her dear  Murchoe Maolseachelvin  tho' depos'd from the Monarchy had great Interest in the Province of  Meath  and soon rais'd such For∣ces as perchance none else could have done which  Bryan  under∣standing made him General of  that part of the Army and sent for his Son back to himself  But if the Meeting of this A∣morous Pair was so full of Joy and Content yet their Parting was such as is not to be express'd they took their leaves of each other with such unwillingness and regret that their Separation seem'd to have rent their Hearts asunder  Murchoe  was not altogether so overwhelm'd as he had formerly been since his Hopes now stood fair in a few days to Crown all his Sufferings with the enjoyment of his Charming  Dooneflaith  But the disconsolate FairOne felt such Pangs at his taking his leave as gave those who stood by especially her Father cause to suspect they were but too fatal Omens And he being willing they should have all the liberty  the little time he had too see her to say what they pleas'd privately together he withdrew and left them to themselves  Now it was that  Dooneflaith  vented the tenders of her Soul in such a manner that  Murchoe  him∣self could hardly stay with her to hear the Complaints which she made of her hard Destiny  Oh  Murchoe  said she you are go∣ing to leave me for ever I have something here at my Heart that prompts my Soul to think  Murchoe  will never re∣turn to his  Dooneflaith  again my presaging Heart forebodes that the Victory which you are going to win will be cause of Joy to all  Ireland  but my unfortunate self  Murchoe  us'd all Arguments that could be thought of to dissipate her Fears  And told her that  his Courage guarded by the hopes of her Love would make him do things that should fill the Trumpet of Fame to the end of the World I go my Charming  Dooneflaith  says he to set this Kingdom in Peace that so I with the more free∣dom may quietly enjoy the Blessing the Gods would bestow at the end of the Conquest and that  Ireland  might be so set∣tled that he no more might have cause to quit her soft Arms to follow the Wars  Go  Murchoe  reply'd she with such languishing looks and so dying a tone as almost made him alter his firm Resolu∣tion Go and fight for thy Country Go and Conquer Go andI would fain say return again to my Arms ButOh something here at my Heart  will not let me believe the Hea∣vens will make me so Happy No my  Murchoe  these Eyes will never behold thee again and the next Embrace thou hast will be that cold one of Death Methinks I see my dearest  Murchoe  all pale and cold stuck through with a thou∣sand Darts and Arrows his breathless Corps spurting fresh streams of Blood when I un∣happy I come by who am his Murderer  No more my Charmer says  Murchoe  to her drive these idle Thoughts away they are but Dreams which will disturb thy Rest I shall return I know it by my Heart Oh that I did said he to himself Or say I dy'd I paid but Nature's Debt what you and I and all must do at last my Fall shall  not be mean and thousands bra∣ver Men shall bear me Com∣pany Oh  Dooneflaith  what Comfort will it be how will it soften Death and blunt its sharpest Dart to think I die be∣lov'd by thee  While they were Embracing in order to Part  Maolseachelvin  came in and told him he must make all hast possible with his Forces for all the others which they expected were come in but his  The Prince as eager as he was to meet his proud Challenger and not think of leaving his Mistress behind wherefore by her Con∣sent and joint intreaty  Maolsea∣chelvin  promis'd to bring her with him this at last something appeas'd the Sorrow of both and  Murchoe  after a thousand soft Kisses and Embraces and as  many Sighs and Tears on both sides took Horse and posted be∣fore to his Father and the next day after  Maolseachelvin  follow'd with his Army and at the Rear of that the beautiful  Doone∣flaith  In a few days after the Armies of the three Provinces joyn'd all together and march'd in good order to the Place appointed be∣ing a spacious Field near  Clan∣tarfe  call'd  Magnealta  where they beheld  Maolmordh  at the Head of a vast Army being six∣teen Thousand  Danes  together with all the Forces he could raise in  Leinster  which was divided into three Battalions that of the Right Wing Commanded by  Carolus Knutus  that on the Left by his Brother  Andreas  the two Sons of the  Danish  King and the Main Body  Maolmordh  took care of himself  Bryan  drew up his Army much after the same Order committing the Right Wing thereof to  Maol∣seachelvin  the Left he Com∣manded himself and at the in∣treaty of his Son  Murchoe  that he might oppose  Maolmordh  him∣self who had given him a Chal∣lenge the main Body was under his Conduct  Early next Morning it being  Good Friday  both Armies drew near and after a short time the fatal Signal was given on both sides never did two Armies en∣counter more fiercely the shouts and cries with the Thunder∣ing noise of the Drums and sound of Trumpets were enough to rend the very Roof of Heaven Nor for half the Day could it be decided upon which side hover∣ing Victory would light and had  Maolseachelvin  who Headed the Army of  Meath  came up they  had soon turn'd the Scale But he remembring the Affront of  Bryan  who made him be De∣pos'd to make way for himself as soon as the Signal was given stood off with his Men and was only a Spectator of the most bloody and terrible Fight that ever was Acted on the Tragick Theatre of  Irish  Ground Nay tho' at one time he saw his own Countrymen begin to give way and the  Danes  in a probability of winning the Day yet did he stand unmov'd  Bryan  who Headed the Left Wing of the Army being Old for he was now above fourscore and eight having to do with  Carolus  who was both Valiant and Young was in the Battle struck from his Horse and had not Prince  Murchoe  come timely to his Rescue he had been trod  to pieces by the Enemy which ne∣vertheless so bruis'd and wound∣ed him that he was forc'd to be carry'd to his Tent leaving the Charge of his Army to Prince  Murchoe  Now was the time that he had the whole Fate of  Ireland  de∣pending upon his Sword he did such wondrous Actions as sur∣pass'd all belief and so bravely behav'd himself as tho' he had been some God sent down from above He spight of all their Forces thinking of the Liberty of his Country and Love of his dear  Dooneflaith  made such breaches in their Main Body that not∣withstanding they had all the Inspiration of Courage that MartialConduct Ambition Glory Revenge and Despair could afford them yet so great was  Murchoe  's Courage and  Conduct so happy that the  Da∣nish  and  Leinster  Forces could no longer withstand him having with his own Hand first slain  Maolmordh  who was the first occasion of this War and then at two several times the two Sons of the King of  Denmark  whose Loss so disheartned the Enemy that they gave way to an easie though dearbought Victory for  Murchoe  being too far engag'd among the  Danish  Horse tho' overpower'd with Number fought 'till he had made a Ram∣part of dead Bodies about him which for some time secur'd him from Fate but an unlucky acci∣dental Arrow laid him dead up∣on a Pyramid of his fallen Ene∣mies  Yet for all this did not the resolute  Irish  loose one foot of Ground or one bit of their Cou∣rage  but rather spur'd on by Revenge made the  Danes  pay dear for his Loss and in a short time became sole Masters of the Field Thus without the assist∣ance of  Maolseachelvin  were the  Danes  overcome one whereof whose Name was  Bruador  be∣ing Commander of a  Danish  Party and who with his Men flying in the General Rout was forc'd to take that way where  Bryan  the Monarch's Pavi∣lion was pitch'd into which as he was passing by he en∣tred and seeing the King whom he had formerly known  Bryan  suspecting no such thing having totally gain'd the Battle basely Murder'd him as he lay wounded in his Bed But he soon had the Reward due to so Trea∣cherous an Act for he and all who follow'd him were by his  Guards and the Pursuers cut all to pieces  Maolseachelvin  after this put in for his Share and made him∣self once more Monarch of  Ire∣land  Tho' his Daughter no sooner heard the Death of her Lover but as though she had lain down to Sleep flung her self on her Bed and without so much as one Groan Sigh or Murmur she cry'd  My  Mur∣choe  calls me and I must go to him  so dy'd in the presence of her Father and the rest of the Nobility who had escap'd in the Battle for there were but few left alive and on the Mo∣narch's Side besides  Bryan  him∣self and the Renowned Prince  Murchoe  his Son were kill'd in this Battle Seven petty Kings most of the Princes and Nobi∣lity of  Munster  and  Conaught  and four Thousand of meaner Degree  But on the other side  viz  that of the  Danes  and  Leinster  Party were Slain  Maolmordh MacMurchoe  the King of  Lein∣ster  who was the Original Cause of this Slaughter with all his Principal Nobles and three Thou∣sand Common Soldiers toge∣ther with  Knutus  and  Andreas  the two Sons of the King of  Den∣mark  and all their Great Com∣manders with six Thousand se∣ven Hundred of the Newcome Forces from  Denmark  that they had brought over with them and four Thousand of the old  Danes  who were before their coming in  Ireland  In all the Slaughter on both Sides that Day amount∣ed to seven Thousand seven Hun∣dred Men besides Kings Prin∣ces Commanders and other No∣bleMen  Some time after this Battle  Maolseachelvin  who now the second time sat on the Monar∣chical Throne of  Ireland  and was the last Monarch of the  Mi∣lesian  Race took  Dublin  Sack'd it Burnt it and Slew in it all those  Danes  who had made their escape thither from the Battle of  Clantarfe  The next Year in the said  Maolseachelvin  's Reign  Huag∣haire MacDuniling MacTuatil  another King of  Leinster  who succeeded  Maolmordh  tho' of a more Noble Race and better In∣terested for the Good of his Country gave a mighty over∣throw which was the last that was given to  Stetirick  the Son of  Aomlaibh  and the  Danes  of  Dublin  who after the Battle of  Clantarfe  and the Burning of  Dublin  by  Maolseachelvin  had  once more Recruited from the  Isle of Man  and other Islands which were yet in Possession of the  Danes  but were now totally destroy'd throughout all  Ireland  Thus did that Warlike and An∣cient Kingdom free it self from the Tyranny of its mortal
