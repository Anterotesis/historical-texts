 THE Roguish MILLER  OR Nothing got by Cheating A TRUE BALLAD  A Miller there was and he liv'd at his Mill  Which was built on a stream at the foot of a hill  He cheated all day and he drank all the night  For cheating and drinking was all his delight  While his moments in tippling unheeded did roll  This still was his sayingbe sure to take toll  Whoever sent corn to be ground at his Mill  He spoilt it he chang'd it he pilfer'd it still  In villainy thus a long course he did run  For he fancy'd that cheating was very good fun  He car'd not what came of his body or soul  While this was his sayingI'll always take toll  If you sent a full Sack of good corn to his Mill  A Sack of bad flour he sent you back still  For he fancy'd that when he the wheat had once ground  The difference wou'd not be easily found  Now to change good for bad was as if he had stole  And he not only chang'd itbut always took toll  The Neighbours oft sent him their Money to pay  But he always refus'd it and sent it away  Had he taken the Money he'd have got but his due  But the payment that's lawful for him wou'd not do  What was honestly his he despis'd on the whole  Because he got more fromthe taking of toll  One day when a Farmer had sent a good sack  Of his Corn to be ground and then sent for it back  He call'd to his Man and demanded straitway  If for this he had taken the toll on that day  The Man strait declar'd that tho' nought he had stole  Yet that he had takenthe full of the toll  He then call'd his maid and he ask'd her good lack  If toll she had taken from that very sack  She declar'd that she had but he fond of pelf  Said for fear that you shou'd not I'll take it myself  So rashly he ventur'd the loss of his Soul  And mended his practiceby thrice taking toll  At length he grew bolder and bolder in sin  And cheating he deeper and deeper got in  Of Satan alas he was quite at the beck  Where he first took a pound he at length took a peck  No church he frequented to pray for his Soul  Who wou'd might go thitherso he could take toll  The Farmer the Squire the Parson likewise  Agreed to observe him with still keener Eyes  But the Justice he cheated to such a degree  That no longer with patience his frauds cou'd he see  So he sent him to jail by the LAW's just controul  And a MITTIMUS paid himfor taking of toll  Come all honest Millers whoever you be  And listen to counsel that's given by me  Be content like fair tradesmen with moderate gains  And look for a lawful reward of your pains  If 'tis paid you in money be pleas'd on the whole  And if you take anytake moderate toll  O seek not each way to defraud that you can  Nor cheat in the flour nor cheat in the bran  Be honest and all Men will flock to your Mill  And tho' others want custom yours ne'er will stand still  And when to your MAKER you give up your soul  You'll rejoice that you alwaystook moderate toll  Z  Sold by S HAZARD PRINTER to the CHEAP REPOSITORY for Religious and Moral Tracts at BATH  By J MARSHALL  At the CHEAP REPOSITORIES No QueenStreet CheapSide and No Aldermary Church Yard LONDON and by all Booksellers Newsmen and Hawkers in Town and CountryGreat Allowance to Shopkeepers and Hawkers  ENTERED at STATIONERS HALL  Price an Halfpenny or s d per s d for d for
