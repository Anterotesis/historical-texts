Persons pertinaciously obstinate in their Principles are of all others the most irksome except perhaps those with Persons who really do not believe at all the Opinion they defend but engage in the Controversy from Affectation from a Spirit of Opposition or from a Desire of showing Wit and Ingenuity superior to the rest of Mankind The same blind Adherence to their own Arguments is to be excepted in both the same Contempt of their Antagonists and the same passionate Vehemence in inforcing Sophistry and Falshood And as reasoning is not the Source whence either Disputant derives his Tenets 'tis in vain to expect that any Logic which speaks not to the Affections will ever engage him to embrace sounder Principles  THOSE who have refused the Reality of moral Distinctions may be ranked in the latter Class amongst the disingenuous Disputants nor is it conceivable that any human Creature could ever seriously believe that all Characters and Actions were alike entitled to the Affection and Regard of every one The Difference which Nature has plac'd betwixt one Man and another is so wide and this Difference is still so much farther widened by Education Example and Habit that where the opposite Extremes come at once under our Apprehension there is no Scepticism so scrupulous and scarce any Assurance so determin'd as absolutely to deny all Distinction betwixt them Let a Man's Insensibility be ever so great he must often be touch'd with the Images of RIGHT and WRONG and let his Prejudices be ever so obstinate he must observe that others are susceptible of like Impressions The only Way therefore of converting an Antagonist of this Kind is to leave him to himself For finding that Nobody keeps up the Controversy with him 'tis probable he will at last of himself from mere Weariness come over to the Side of common Sense and Reason  THERE has been a Controversy started of late much better worth Examination concerning the  general Foundation of MORALS whether they are derived from REASON or from SENTIMENT whether we attain the Knowledge of them by a Chain of Argument and Deduction or by an immediate Feeling and finer internal Sense whether like all sound Judgment of Truth and Falshood they should be the same in every rational intelligent Being or whether like the Perception of Beauty and Deformity they are founded entirely on the particular Fabric and Constitution of the human Species  THE antient Philosophers tho' they often affirm that Virtue is nothing but Conformity to Reason yet in general seem to consider Morals as deriving their Existence from Taste and Sentiment On the other Hand our modern Enquirers tho' they also talk much of the Beauty of Virtue and Deformity of Vice yet have commonly endeavoured to account for these Distinctions by metaphysical Reasonings and by Deductions from the most abstract Principles of human Understanding Such Confusion reign'd in these Subjects that an Opposition of the greatest Consequence could prevail betwixt one System and another and even in the Parts almost of each individual System and yet Nobody till very lately was ever sensible of it The elegant and sublime Lord  Shaftesbury  who first gave Occasion to remark this Distinction and who in general adher'd to the  Principles of the Antients is not himself entirely free from the same Confusion  IT must be acknowledged that both Sides of the Question are susceptible of specious Arguments Moral Distinctions it may be said are discernible by pure  Reason  Else whence the many Disputes that reign in common Life as well as in Philosophy with regard to this Subject The long Chain of Proofs often adduc'd on both Sides the Examples cited the Authorities appeal'd to the Analogies employ'd the Fallacies detected the Inferences drawn and the several Conclusions adjusted to their proper Principles Truth is disputable not Taste What exists in the Nature of Things is the Standard of our Judgment what each Man feels within himself is the Standard of Sentiment Propositions in Geometry may be prov'd Systems in Physics may be controverted but the Harmony of Verse the Tenderness of Passion the Brilliancy of Wit must give immediate Pleasure No Man reasons concerning another's Beauty but frequently concerning the Justice or Injustice of his Actions In every Trial of Criminals their first Object is to disprove the Facts alledged and deny the Actions imputed to them The second to prove that even if these Actions were real they might be justified as innocent and lawful 'Tis confessedly by Deductions of the Understanding that the first Point is ascertain'd  How can we suppose that a different Faculty of the Mind is employ'd in fixing the other  ON the other Hand those who would resolve all moral Determinations into  Sentiment  may endeavour to show that 'tis impossible for Reason ever to draw Conclusions of this Nature To Virtue say they it belongs to be  amiable  and Vice  odious  This forms their very Nature or Essence But can Reason or Argumentation distribute these different Epithets to any Subjects and pronounce  a priori  that this must produce Love and that Hatred Or what other Reason can we ever assign for these Affections but the original Fabric and Formation of the human Mind which is naturally adapted to receive them  THE End of all moral Speculations is to teach us our Duty and by proper Representations of the Deformity of Vice and Beauty of Virtue beget correspondent Habits and engage us to avoid the one and embrace the other But is this ever to be expected from Inferences and Conclusions of the Understanding which of themselves have no Hold of the Affections nor set the active Powers of Men in Motion and Employment They discover Truth but where the Truths they discover are indifferent and beget no Desire or Aversion they can have no Influence on Conduct and Behaviour What is honourable  what is fair what is becoming what is noble what is generous takes Possession of the Heart and animates us to embrace and to maintain it What is intelligible what is evident what is probable what is true procures only the cool Assent of the Understanding and gratifying a speculative Curiosity puts an end to our Researches  EXTINGUISH all the warm Feelings and Prepossessions in favour of Virtue and all Disgust or Aversion against Vice Render Men totally indifferent towards these Distinctions and Morality is no longer a practical Study nor has any Tendency to regulate our Lives and Actions  THESE Arguments on both Sides and many more might be adduc'd are so plausible that I am apt to suspect they may both of them be solid and satisfactory and that  Reason  and  Sentiment  concur in almost all moral Determinations and Conclusions The final Sentence 'tis probable which pronounces Characters and Actions amiable or odious praiseworthy or blameable that which stamps on them the Mark of Honour or Infamy Approbation or Censure that which renders Morality an active Principle and constitutes Virtue our Happiness and Vice our Misery 'Tis probable I say that this final Sentence depends on some internal Sense or Feeling  which Nature has made universal to the whole Species For what else can have an Influence of this Nature But in order to pave the Way for such a Sentiment and give Men a proper Discernment of its Object 'tis often necessary we find that much Reasoning should precede that nice Distinctions he made just Conclusions drawn distant Comparisons form'd accurate Relations examin'd and general Facts fix'd and ascertain'd Some Species of Beauty especially the natural Kinds on their first Appearance command our Affection and Approbation and where they fail of this Effect 'tis impossible for any Reasoning to redress their Influence or adapt them better to our Taste and Sentiment But in many Orders of Beauty particularly those of the finer Arts 'tis requisite to employ much Reasoning in order to feel the proper Sentiment and a false Relish may frequently be corrected by Argument and Reflection There are just Grounds to conclude that moral Beauty partakes much of this latter Species and demands the Assistance of our intellectual Faculties in order to give it a suitable Influence on the human Mind  BUT tho' this Question concerning the general Principle of Morals be extremely curious and important 'tis needless for us at present to employ farther Care in our Enquiries concerning it For if we can be so happy in the Course of this Enquiry  as to fix the just Origin of Morals 'twill then easily appear how far Sentiment or Reason enters into all Determinations of this Nature  See Appendix First  Mean while it will scarce be possible for us 'ere this Controversy is fully decided to proceed in that accurate Manner requir'd in the Sciences by beginning with exact Definitions of VIRTUE and VICE which are the Objects of our present Enquiry But we shall do what may justly be esteem'd as satisfactory We shall consider the Matter as an Object of Experience We shall call  every Quality or Action of the Mind  virtuous  which is attended with the general Approbation of Mankind  And we shall denominate vicious  every Quality which is the Object of general Blame or Censure  These Qualities we shall endeavour to collect and after examining on both Sides the several Circumstances in which they agree 'tis hop'd we may at last reach the Foundation of Ethics and find those universal Principles from which all moral Blame or Approbation is ultimately derived As this is a Question of Fact not of abstract Science we can only expect Success by following this experimental Method and deducing general Maxims from a Comparison of particular Instances The other scientifical Method where a general abstract Principle is first establish'd and is afterwards branch'd  out into a Variety of Inferences and Conclusions may be more perfect in itself but suits less the Imperfection of human Nature and is a common Source of Illusion and Mistake in this as well as in other Subjects Men are now cured of their Passion for Hypotheses and Systems in natural Philosophy and will hearken to no Arguments but those deriv'd from Experience 'Tis full Time they should begin a like Reformation in all moral Disquisitions and reject every System of Ethics however subtile or ingenious that is not founded on Fact and Observation  SECTION II  Of BENEVOLENCE  PART I  THERE is a Principle suppos'd to prevail amongst many which is utterly incompatible with all Virtue or moral Sentiment and as it can proceed from nothing but the most deprav'd Disposition so in its Turn it tends still farther to foster and encourage that Depravity This Principle is that all  Benevolence  is mere Hypocrisy Friendship a Cheat Public Spirit a Farce Fidelity a Snare to procure Trust and Confidence and while all of us at the Bottom pursue only our private Interest we wear these fair Disguises in order to put others off their Guard and expose them the more to our Wiles and Machinations What Heart one must be possess'd of who professes such Principles and who feels no internal Sentiment to belye so pernicious a Theory 'tis easy to imagine And also what Degree of Affection and Benevolence he can bear to a Species  whom he represents under such odious Colours and supposes so little susceptible of Gratitude or any Return of Affection Or if we will not ascribe these Principles altogether to a corrupted Heart we must at least account for them from the most careless and precipitate Examination Superficial Reasoners indeed observing many false Pretences amongst Mankind and feeling perhaps no very strong Restraint in their own Disposition might draw a general and a hasty Conclusion that all is equally corrupted and that Men different from all other Animals and indeed from all other Species of Existence admit of no Degrees of Good or Bad but are in every Instance the same Creatures under different Disguises and Appearances  THERE is another Principle somewhat resembling the former which has been much insisted on by Philosophers and has been the Foundation of many a fair System that whatever Affection one may feel or imagine he feels for others no Passion is or can be disinterested that the most generous Friendship however sincere is a Modification of Selflove and that even unknown to Ourselves we seek only our Gratification while we appear the most deeply engag'd in Schemes for the Liberty and Happiness of Mankind By a Turn of Imagination by a Refinement of Reflection by an Enthusiasin of Passion  we seem to take Part in the Interests of others and imagine Ourselves divested of all selfish Views and Considerations But at the Bottom the most generous Patriot and most niggardly Miser the bravest Hero and most abject Coward have in every Action an equal Regard to their own Happiness and Welfare  WHOEVER concludes from the seeming Tendency of this Opinion that those who make Profession of it cannot possibly feel the true Sentiments of Benevolence or have any Regard for genuine Virtue will often find himself in Practice very much mistaken Probity and Honour were no Strangers to  Epicurus  and his Sect  Atticus  and  Horace  seem to have enjoy'd from Nature and cultivated by Reflection as generous and friendly Dispositions as any Disciple of the austerer Schools And amongst the Moderns  Hobbes  and  Locke  who maintain'd the selfish System of Morals liv'd most irreproachable Lives tho' the former lay not under any Restraints of Religion which might supply the Defects of his Philosophy  AN  Epicurean  or a  Hobbist  readily allows that there is such a Thing as Friendship in the World without Hypocrisy or Disguise tho' he may attempt by a philosophical Chymistry to resolve the Elements of this Passion if I may so speak into those of another and explain every Affection to be Selflove twisted  and moulded into a Variety of Shapes and Appearances But as the same Turn of Imagination prevails not in every Man nor gives the same Direction to the original Passion this is sufficient even according to the selfish System to make the widest Difference in human Characters and denominate one Man virtuous and humane another vicious and meanly interested I esteem the Man whose Selflove by whatever Means is so directed as to give him a Concern for others and render him serviceable to Society As I hate or despise him who has no Regard to any Thing beyond his own pitiful Gratifications and Enjoyments In vain would you suggest that these Characters tho' seemingly opposite are at the Bottom the same and that a very inconsiderable Turn of Imagination forms the whole Difference betwixt them Each Character notwithstanding these inconsiderable Differences appears to me in Practice pretty durable and untransmutable And I find not in this more than in other Subjects that the natural Sentiments arising from the general Appearances of Things are easily destroy'd by resin'd Reflections concerning the minute Origin of these Appearances Does not the lively cheerful Colour of a Countenance inspire me with Complacency and Pleasure even tho' I learn from Philosophy that all Difference of Complexion arises from the most minute  Differences of Thickness in the most minute Parts of the Skin by which Differences one Superficies is qualify'd to reflect one of the original Colours of Light and absorb the others  BUT tho' the Question concerning the universal or partial Selfishness of Man be not so material as is usually imagin'd to Morality and Practice it is certainly of great Consequence in the speculative Science of human Nature and is a proper Object of Curiosity and Enquiry It may not therefore be improper in this Place to bestow a few Reflections upon it  Benevolence naturally divides into two Kinds the  general  and  particular  The first is where we have no Friendship or Connexion or Esteem for the Person but feel only a general Sympathy with him or a Compassion for his Pains and a Congratulation with his Pleasures The other Species of Benevolence is founded on an Opinion of Virtue on Services done us or on some particular Cornexions Both these Sentiments must be allow'd real in human Nature but whether they will resolve into some nice Considerations of Selflove is a Question more curious than important The former Sentiment  viz  that of general Benevolence or Humanity or Sympathy we shall have Occasion frequently to treat of in the Course of these Essays and I assume it as real from general Experience without any other Proof    THE most obvious Objection to the selfish Hypothesis is that being contrary to common Feeling and our most unprejudic'd Notions and Opinions there  is requir'd the highest Stretch of Philosophy to establish so extraordinary a Paradox To the most careless Observer there appear to be such Dispositions as Benevolence and Generosity such Affections as Love Friendship Compassion Gratitude These Sentiments have their Causes Effects Objects and Operations markt by common Language and Observation and plainly distinguish'd from the selfish Passions And as this is the obvious Appearance of Things it must be admitted till some Hypothesis be discover'd which by penetrating deeper into human Nature may prove the former Affections to be Nothing but Modifications of the latter All Attempts of this Kind have hitherto prov'd fruitless and seem to have proceeded entirely from that Love of  Simplicity  which has been the Source of much false Reasoning in Philosophy I shall not here enter into any Detail on the present Subject Many able Philosophers have shown the Insufficiency of these Systems And I shall take for granted what I believe the smallest Reflection will make evident to every impartial Enquirer  BUT the Nature of the Subject furnishes the strongest Presumption that no better System will ever for the future be invented to account for the Origin of the benevolent from the selfish Affections and reduce all the various Emotions of the human Mind to a perfect  Simplicity and Uniformity The Case is not the same in this Species of Philosophy as in Physics Many an Hypothesis in Nature contrary to first Appearances has been found on more accurate Scrutiny solid and satisfactory Instances of this Kind are so frequent that a judicious as well as witty Philosopher  Monsr  Fontenelle  has ventur'd to affirm if there be more than one Way in which any Phaenomenon may be produc'd that there is a general Presumption for its arising from the Causes which are the least obvious and familiar But the Presumption always lies on the other Side in all Enquiries concerning the Origin of our Passions and the internal Operations of the human Mind The simplest and most obvious Cause that can there be assign'd for any Phaenomenon is probably the true one When a Philosopher in the Explication of his System is oblig'd to have Recourse to some very intricate and refin'd Reflections and to suppose them essential to the Production of any Passion or Emotion we have Reason to be extremely on our Guard against so fallacious an Hypothesis The Affections are not susceptible of any Impression from the Refinements of Reason or Imagination and 'tis always found that a vigorous Exertion of the latter Faculties from the narrow Capacity of the human Mind destroys all Energy and Activity in the former  Our predominant Motive or Intention is indeed frequently conceal'd from Ourselves when it is mingled and confounded with others which the Mind from Vanity or Selfconceit is desirous of supposing of greater Force and Influence But there is no Instance that a Concealment of this Nature has ever arisen from the Abstruseness and Intricacy of the Motive A Man who has lost a Friend and Patron may flatter himself that all his Grief arises from generous Sentiments without any Mixture of narrow or interested Considerations But a Man who grieves for a valuable Friend that needed his Patronage and Protection how can we suppose that his passionate Tenderness arises from some metaphysical Regards to a Selfinterest which has no Foundation or Reality We may as well imagine that minute Wheels and Springs like those of a Watch give Motion to a loaded Waggon as account for the Origin of Passion from such abstruse Reflections  ANIMALS are found susceptible of Kindness both to their own Species and to ours nor is there in this Case the least Suspicion of Disguise or Artifice Shall we account for all  their  Sentiments too from refin'd Deductions of Selfinterest Or if we admit a disinterested Benevolence in the inferior Species by what Rule of Analogy can we refuse it in the Superior  LOVE betwixt the Sexes begets a Complacency and Goodwill very distinct from the Gratification of an Appetite Tenderness to their Offspring in all sensible Beings is commonly able alone to counterballance the strongest Motives of Selflove and has no Manner of Dependance on that Affection What Interest can a fond Mother have in View who loses her Health by assiduous Attendance on her sick Child and afterwards languishes and dies for Grief when freed by its Death from the Slavery of that Attendance  Is Gratitude no Affection of the human Breast or is that a Word merely without any Meaning or Reality Have we no Complacency or Satisfaction in one Man's Company above another's and no Desire of the Welfare of our Friend even tho' Absence or Death should prevent us from all Participation in it Or what is it commonly that gives us any Participation in it even while alive and present but our Affection and Regard to him  THESE and a thousand other Instances are Marks of a generous Benevolence in human Nature where no  real  Interest binds us to the Object And how an  imaginary  Interest known and avow'd for such can be the Origin of any Passion or Emotion seems difficult  to explain No satisfactory Hypothesis of this Kind has yet been discover'd nor is there the smallest Probability that the future Industry of Men will ever be attended with more favourable Success  BUT farther if we consider rightly of the Matter we shall find that the Hypothesis which allows of a disinterested Benevolence distinct from Selflove has really more  Simplicity  in it and is more conformable to the Analogy of Nature than that which pretends to resolve all Friendship and Humanity into this latter Principle There are bodily Wants or Appetites acknowledged by every one which necessarily precede all sensual Enjoyment and carry us directly to seek Possession of the Object Thus Hunger and Thirst have eating and drinking for their End and from the Gratification of these primary Appetites arises a Pleasure which may become the Object of another Species of Desire or Inclination that is secondary and interested In the same Manner there are mental Passions by which we are impell'd immediately to seek particular Objects such as Fame or Power or Vengeance without any Regard to Interest and when these Objects are attain'd a pleasing Enjoyment ensues as the Consequence of our indulg'd Affections Nature must by the internal Frame and Constitution of the Mind give an original Propensity to Fame 'ere we can reap any Pleasure  from it or pursue it from Motives of Selflove and a Desire of Happiness If I have no Vanity I take no Delight in Praise If I be void of Ambition Power gives no Enjoyment If I be not angry the Punishment of an Adversary is totally indifferent to me In all these Cases there is a Passion which points immediately to the Object and constitutes it our Good or Happiness as there are other secondary Passions which afterwards arise and pursue it as a Part of our Happiness when once it is constituted such by our original Affections Were there no Appetites of any Kind antecedent to Selflove that Propensity could scarce ever exert itself because we should in that Case have felt few and slender Pains or Pleasures and have little Misery or Happiness to avoid or to pursue  Now where is the Difficulty of conceiving that this may likewise be the Case with Benevolence and Friendship and that from the original Frame of our Temper we may feel a Desire of another's Happiness or Good which by Means of that Affection becomes our own Good and is afterwards pursued from the conjoin'd Motives of Benevolence and Selfenjoyment Who sees not that Vengeance from the Force alone of Passion may be so eagerly pursued as to make us knowingly neglect every Consideration of Ease Interest or Safety and like  some vindictive Animals infuse our very Souls into the Wounds we give an Enemy  Animasque in vulnere ponunt VIRG Dom alteri noceat soi negligens says  Scneca  of Anger De Ira L  And what a malignant Philosophy must it be that will not allow to Humanity and Friendship the same Privileges which are indisputably granted to the darker Passions of Enmity and Resentment Such a Philosophy is more like a Satyr than a true Delineation or Description of human Nature and may be a good Foundation for paradoxical Wit and Raillery but is a very bad one for any serious Argument or Reasoning  PART II  IT may be esteem'd perhaps a superfluous Task to prove that the benevolent or softer Affections are VIRTUOUS and wherever they appear attract the Esteem Approbation and Goodwill of Mankind The Epithets  sociable goodnatur'd humane merciful grateful friendly generous beneficent  are known in all Languages and universally express the highest Merit which  human Nature  is capable of attaining Where these amiable Qualities are attended with Birth and Power and eminent Abilities and display themselves in the good Government or  useful Instruction of Mankind they seem even to raise the Possessors of them above the Rank of  human Nature  and approach them in some Measure to the Divine Exalted Capacity undaunted Courage prosperous Success these may only expose a Hero or Politician to the Envy and Malignity of the Public But as soon as the Praises are added of humane and beneficent when Instances are display'd of Lenity Tenderness or Friendship Envy itself is silent or joins the general Voice of Applause and Acclamation  WHEN  Pericles  the great  Athenian  Statesman and General was on his Deathbed his surrounding Friends esteeming him now insensible began to indulge their Sorrow for their expiring Patron by enumerating his great Qualities and Successes his Conquests and Victories the unusual Length of his Administration and his nine Trophies erected over the Enemies of the Republic  You forget  cries the dying Hero who had heard all  you forget the most eminent of my Praises while you dwell so much on those vulgar Advantages in which Fortune had a principal Share You have not observ'd that no Citizen has ever yet wore Mourning on my Account  Plut in Pericle    IN Men of more ordinary Talents and Capacity the social Virtues become if possible still more essentially requisite there being nothing eminent in that Case to compensate for the Want of them or preserve the Person from our severest Hatred as well as Contempt A high Ambition an elevated Courage is apt says  Cicero  in less perfect Characters to degenerate into a turbulent Ferocity The more social and softer Virtues are there chiefly to be regarded These are always good and amiable  Cic de Officiis Lib    THE principal Advantage which  Juvenal  discovers in the extensive Capacity of the human Species is that it renders our Benevolence also more extensive and gives us larger Opportunities of spreading our kindly Influence than what are indulg'd to the inferior Creation  Sat xv seq  It must indeed be confest that by doing Good only can a Man truly enjoy the Advantages of being eminent His exalted Station of itself but the more exposes him to Tempest and Thunder His sole Prerogative is to afford Shelter to Inferiors who repose themselves under his Cover and Protection  BUT I forget that it is not my present Business to recommend Generosity and Benevolence or to paint  in their true Colours all the genuine Charms of the social Virtues These indeed sufficiently engage every Heart on the first Apprehension of them and 'tis difficult to abstain from some Sally of Panegyric as often as they occur in Discourse or Reasoning But our Object here being more the speculative than the practical Part of Morals 'twill suffice to remark what will readily I believe be allow'd that no Qualities are more entitled to the general Goodwill and Approbation of Mankind than Beneficence and Humanity Friendship and Gratitude Natural Affection and Public Spirit or whatever proceeds from a tender Sympathy with others and a generous Concern for our Kind and Species These whereever they appear seem to transfuse themselves in a Manner into each Beholder and to call forth in their own Behalf the same favourable and affectionate Sentiments which they exert on all around them  PART III  WE may observe that in displaying the Praises of any humane beneficent Man there is one Circumstance which never fails to be amply insisted on  viz  the Happiness and Satisfaction deriv'd to Society from his Intercourse and Goodoffices  To his Parents we are apt to say he endears himself by his pious Attachment and duteous Care still more than by the Connexions of Nature His Children never feel his Authority but when employ'd for their Advantage With him the Ties of Love are consolidated by Beneficence and Friendship The Ties of Friendship approach in a fond Observance of ech obliging Office to those of Love and Inclination His Domestics and Dependants have in him a sure Resource and no longer dread the Power of Fortune but so far as she exercises it over him From him the hungry receive Food the naked Cloathing the ignorant and slothful Skill and Industry Like the Sun an inferior Minister of Providence he cheers invigorates and sustains the surrounding World  Is consin'd to private Life the Sphere of his Activity is narrower but his Influence is all benign and gentle If exalted into a higher Station Mankind and Posterity reap the Fruit of his Labours  As these Topics of Praise never fail to be employ'd and with Success where we would inspire Esteem for any one may we not thence conclude that the UTILITY resulting from the social Virtues forms at least a  Part  of their Merit and  is  one  Source of that Approbation and Regard so universally pay'd them  WHEN we recommend even an Animal or Plant as  useful  and  beneficial  we give it an Applause and Recommendation suited to its Nature As on the other Hand Reflection on the baneful Influence of any of these inferior Beings always inspires us with the Sentiments of Aversion The Eye is pleas'd with the Prospect of Cornfields and loaded Vineyards Horses grazing and Flocks pasturing But flies the View of Bryars and Brambles affording Shelter to Wolves and Serpents  A Machine a Piece of Furniture a Garment a House well contriv'd for Use and Conveniency is so far beautiful and is contemplated with Pleasure and Approbation An experienc'd Eye is here sensible to many Excellencies which escape Persons ignorant and uninstructed  CAN any Thing stronger be said in Praise of a Profession such as Merchandize or Manufactory than to observe the Advantages which it procures to Society And is not a Monk and Inquisitor enrag'd when we treat his Rank and Order as useless or pernicious to Mankind  THE Historian exults in displaying the Benefit arising from his Labours The Writer of Romances alleviates or denies the bad Consequences ascrib'd to his Manner of Composition  IN general what Praise is imply'd in the simple Epithet  useful  What Reproach in the contrary  YOUR Gods says  Cicero  De Nat Deor Lib  in Opposition to the  Epicureans  cannot justly claim any Worship or Adoration with whatever imaginary Perfections you may suppose them endow'd They are totally useless and inactive And even the  Egyptians  whom you so much ridicule never consecrated any Animal but on Account of its Utility  THE Sceptics assert  Sext Emp adversus Math Lib  tho' absurdly that the Origin of all religious Worship was deriv'd from the Utility of inanimate Objects as the Sun and Moon to the Support and Wellbeing of Mankind This is also the common Reason assign'd by Historians for the Deification of eminent Heroes and Legislators  Diod Sic passim    To plant a Tree to cultivate a Field to beget Children meritorious Acts according to the Religion of  Zoroaster  IN all Determinations of Morality this Circumstance of public Utility is ever principally in View and wherever Disputes arise whether in Philosophy or common Life concerning the Bounds of Duty the Question cannot by any Means be decided with greater Certainty than by ascertaining on any Side the true Interests of Mankind If any false Opinion embrac'd from Appearances has been found to prevail as soon as farther Experience and sounder Reasoning have given us juster Notions of human Affairs we retract our first Sentiments and adjust anew the Boundaries of moral Good and Evil  ALMS to common Beggars is naturally prais'd because it seems to carry Relief to the distrest and indigent But when we observe the Encouragement thence arising to Idleness and Debauchery we regard that Species of Charity rather as a Weakness than a Virtue  Tyrannicide  or the Assassination of Usurpers and oppressive Princes was highly prais'd in antient Times because it both freed Mankind from many of these Monsters and seem'd to keep the others in Awe whom the Poinard or the Poison could not reach But History and Experience having since convinc'd  us that this Practice encreases the Jealousy and Cruelty of Princes a  Timoleon  and a  Brutus  tho' treated with Indulgence on Account of the Prejudices of their Times are now consider'd as very improper Models for Imitation  LIBERATITY in Princes is regarded as a Mark of Beneficence But when it occurs that the homely Bread of the Honest and Industrious is often thereby converted into delicious Cates for the Idle and the Prodigal we soon retract our heedless Praises The Regrets of a Prince for having lost a Day were noble and generous But had he intended to have spent it in Acts of Generosity to his greedy Courtiers 'twas better lost than misemploy'd after that Manner  LUXURY or a Refinement on the Pleasures and Conveniencies of Life had long been suppos'd the Source of every Corruption and Disorder in Government and the immediate Cause of Faction Sedition civil Wars and the total Loss of Liberty It was therefore universally regarded as a Vice and was an Object of Declamation to all Satyrists and severe Moralists Those who prove or attempt to prove that such Refinements rather tend to the Encrease of Industry Civility and Arts regulate a new our  moral  as well as  political  Sentiments  and represent as laudable and innocent what had formerly been regarded as pernicious and blameable  UPON the Whole then it seems undeniable  that  there is such a Sentiment in human Nature as disinterested Benevolence  that  nothing can bestow more Merit on any human Creature than the Possession of it in an eminent Degree and  that  a  Part  at least of its Merit arises from its Tendency to promote the Interests of our Species and bestow Happiness on human Society We carry our View into the salutary Consequences of such a Character and Disposition and whatever has so benign an Influence and forwards so desirable an End is beheld with Complacency and Pleasure The social Virtues are never regarded without their beneficial Tendencies nor view'd as barren and unfruitful The Happiness of Mankind the Order of Society the Harmony of Families the mutual Support of Friends are always consider'd as the Result of their gentle Dominion over the Breasts of Men  How considerable a  Part  of their Merit we ought to ascribe to their Utility will better appear from future Disquisitions  Sect d and th  as well as the Reason why this Circumstance has such a Command over our Esteem and Approbation  Sect th    SECTION III  Of JUSTICE  PART I  THAT JUSTICE is useful to Society and consequently that  Part  of its Merit at least must arise from that Consideration 'twould be asuperfluous Undertaking to prove That public Utility is the  sole  Origin of Justice and that Reflections on the beneficial Consequences of this Virtue are the  sole  Foundation of its Merit this Proposition being more curious and important will better deserve our Examination and Enquiry  LET us suppose that Nature has bestow'd on human Race such profuse  Abundance  of all  external  Conveniencies that without any Uncertainty in the Event without any Care or Industry on our Part every Individual finds himself fully provided of  whatever his most voracious Appetites can want or luxurious Imagination wish or desire His natural Beauty we shall suppose surpasses all acquir'd Ornaments The perpetual Clemency of the Seasons renders useless all Cloaths or Covering The raw Herbage affords him the most delicious Fare the clear Fountain the richest Beverage No laborious Occupation requir'd No Tillage No Navigation Music Poetry and Contemplation form his sole Business Conversation Mirth and Friendship his sole Amusement  IT seems evident that in such a happy State every other social Virtue would flourish and receive a tenfold Encrease but the cautious jealous Virtue of Justice would never once have been dreamt of For what Purpose make a Partition of Goods where every one has already more than enough Why give Rise to Property where there cannot possibly be any Injury Why call this Object  mine  when upon the Seizure of it by another I need but stretch out my Hand to possess myself of what is equally valuable Justice in that Case being totally USELESS would be an idle Ceremonial and could never possibly have Place amongst the Catalogue of Virtues  WE see even in the present necessitous Condition of Mankind that wherever any Benefit is bestow'd by Nature in an unlimited Abundance we leave it always in common amongst the whole human Race and make no Subdivisions of Right and Property Water and Air tho' the most necessary of all Objects are not challeng'd by Individuals nor can any one commit Injustice by the most lavish Use and Enjoyment of these Blessings In fertile extensive Countries with few Inhabitants Land is regarded on the same Footing And no Topic is so much insisted on by those who defend the Liberty of the Seas as the unexhausted Use of them in Navigation Were the Advantages procur'd by Navigation as inexhaustible these Reasoners never had had any Adversaries to refute nor had any Claims been ever advanc'd of a separate exclusive Dominion over the Ocean  IT may happen in some Countries at some Periods that there be establish'd a Property in Water none in Land  Genesis  chap xiii and xxi  if the latter be in greater Abundance than can be us'd by the Inhabitants and the former be found with Difficulty and in very small Quantities  AGAIN suppose that tho' the Necessities of human Race continue the same as at present yet the Mind is so enlarg'd and so replete with Friendship and Generosity that every Man has the utmost Tenderness for every Man and feels no more Concern for his own Interest than for that of his Fellow It seems evident that the USE of Justice would in this Case be suspended by such an extensive Benevolence nor would the Divisions and Barriers of Property and Obligation have ever been thought of Why should I bind another by a Deed or Promise to do me any Goodoffice when I know he is beforehand prompted by the strongest Inclination to seek my Happiness and would of himself perform the desir'd Service except the Hurt he thereby receives be greater than the Benefit accruing to me In which Case he knows that from my innate Humanity and Friendship I should be the first to oppose myself to his imprudent Generosity Why raise Landmarks betwixt my Neighbour's Field and mine when my Heart has made no Division betwixt our Interests but shares all his Joys and Sorrows with equal Force and Vivacity as if originally my own Every Man upon this Supposition being a Secondself to another would trust all his Interests to the Discretion of every Man without Jealousy without Partition without Distinction  And the whole Race of Mankind would form only one Family where all lay in common and was us'd freely without Regard to Property but cautiously too with as entire Regard to the Necessities of each Individual as if our own Interests were most intimately concern'd  IN the present Disposition of the human Heart 'twould perhaps be difficult to find compleat Instances of such enlarg'd Affections but still we may observe that the Case of Families approaches towards it and the stronger is the mutual Benevolence amongst the Individuals the nearer it approaches till all Distinction of Property be in a great Measure lost and confounded amongst them Betwixt marry'd Persons the Cement of Friendship is by the Laws suppos'd so strong as to abolish all Division of Possessions and has often in Reality the Force ascribed to it And 'tis observable that during the Ardour of new Enthusiasms where every Principle is inflam'd into Extravagance the Community of Goods has frequently been attempted and nothing but Experience of its Inconveniencies from the returning or disguis'd Selfishness of Men could make the imprudent Fanatics adopt anew the Ideas of Justice and of separate Property So true is it that that Virtue derives  its Existence altogether from its necessary  Use  to the Intercourse and Society of Mankind  To make this Truth more evident let us reverse the foregoing Suppositions and carrying every Thing to the opposite Extreme consider what would be the Effect of these new Situations Suppose a Society to fall into such Want of all common Necessaries that the utmost Frugality and Industry cannot preserve the greatest Number from perishing and the whole from extreme Sufferance It will readily I believe be admitted that the strict Laws of Justice are suspended in such a pressing Emergence and give Place to the stronger Motives of Necessity and Selfpreservation Is it any Crime after a Shipwreck to seize whatever Means or Instrument of Safety one can lay hold of without Regard to former Limitations of Property Or if a City besieg'd were starving with Hunger can we imagine that Men will see any Means of Life before them and perish from a scrupulous Regard to what in other Situations would be the Rules of Equity and Justice The USE and TENDENCY of that Virtue is to procure Happiness and Security by preserving Order in Society But where the Society is ready to perish from extreme Necessity no greater Evil can be dreaded from Violence and In  ustice and every Man may now provide for himself  by all Means which Prudence can dictate or Humanity permit The Public even in less urgent Necessities open Granaries without the Consent of Proprietors as justly supposing that the Authority of Magistracy may consistent with Equity extend so far But were any Number of Men to assemble without the Tye of Laws or civil Jurisdiction would an equal Partition of Bread in a Famine even without the Proprietor's Consent be regarded as criminal or injurious  SUPPOSE also that it should be a virtuous Man's Fate to fall into the Society of Ruffians remote from the Protection of Laws and Government what Conduct must he embrace in that melancholy Situation He sees such a desperate Rapaciousness prevail such a Disregard to Equity such Contempt of Order such stupid Blindness to future Consequences as must immediately have the most tragical Conclusion and must terminate in Destruction to the greater Number and in a total Dissolution of Society to the rest He mean while can have no other Expedient than to arm himself to whomever the Sword he seizes or the Buckler may belong Make Provision of all Means of Defence and Security And his particular Regard to Justice being no longer of USE to his own Safety or that of others he must consult alone the Dictates of Selfpreservation  without Concern for those who no longer merit his Care and Attention  WHEN any Man even in political Society renders himself by his Crimes obnoxious to the Public he is punish'd by the Laws in his Goods and Person that is the ordinary Rules of Justice are with Regard to him suspended for a Moment and it becomes equitable to inflict on him for the  Benefit  of Society what otherwise he could not suffer without Wrong or Injury  THE Rage and Violence of public War what is it but a Suspension of Justice amongst the warring Parties who perceive that that Virtue is now no longer of any  Use  or  Advantage  to them The Laws of War which then succeed to those of Equity and Justice are Rules calculated for the  Advantage  and  Utility  of that particular State in which Men are now plac'd And were a civiliz'd Nation engag'd with Barbarians who observ'd no Rules even of War the former must also suspend their Observance of them where they no longer serve to any Purpose and must render every Action or Rencounter as bloody and pernicious as possible to the first Aggressors  THUS the Rules of Equity or Justice depend entirely on the particular State and Condition in which Men are plac'd and owe their Origin and Existence to that UTILITY which results to the Public from their strict and regular Observance Reverse in any considerable Circumstance the Condition of Men Produce extreme Abundance or extreme Necessity Implant in the human Breast perfect Moderation and Humanity or perfect Rapaciousness and Malice By rendering Justice totally  useless  you thereby totally destroy its Essence and suspend its Obligation upon Mankind  THE common Situation of Society is a Medium amidst all these Extremes We are naturally partial to Ourselves and to our Friends but are capable of learning the Advantage resulting from a more equal Conduct Few Enjoyments are given us from the open and liberal Hand of Nature but by Art Labour and Industry we can extract them in great Abundance Hence the Ideas of Property become necessary in all civil Society Hence Justice derives its Usefulness to the Public And hence alone arises its Merit and moral Obligation  THESE Conclusions are so natural and obvious that they have not escap'd even the Poets in their  Descriptions of the Felicity attending the Golden Age or the Reign of  Saturn  The Seasons in that first Period of Nature were so temperate if we credit these agreeable Fictions that there was no Necessity for Men to provide themselves with Cloaths and Houses as a Security against the Violence of Heat and Cold The Rivers flow'd with Wine and Milk The Oaks yielded Honey and Nature spontaneously produc'd her greatest Delicacies Nor were these the chief Advantages of that happy Age The Storms and Tempests were not alone remov'd from Nature but those more furious Tempests were unknown to human Breasts which now cause such Uproar and engender such Confusion Avarice Ambition Cruelty Selfishness were never heard of Cordial Affection Compassion Sympathy were the only Movements with which the Mind was yet acquainted Even the punctilious Distinction of  Mine  and  Thine  was banish'd from amongst that happy Race of Mortals and carry'd with it the very Notion of Property and Obligation Justice and Injustice  THIS  poetical  Fiction of the  Golden Age  is in some Respects of a Piece with the  philosophical  Fiction of the  State of Nature  only that the former is represented as the most charming and most peaceable Condition that can possibly be imagin'd whereas the  latter is pointed out as a State of mutual War and Violence attended with the most extreme Necessity On the first Origin of Mankind as we are told their Ignorance and savage Nature were so prevalent that they could give no mutual Trust but must each depend upon himself and his own Force or Cunning for Protection and Security No Law was heard of No Rule of Justice known No Distinction of Property regarded Power was the only Measure of Right and a perpetual War of All against All was the Result of their untam'd Selfishness and Barbarity  This Fiction of a State of Nature as a State of War was not first started by Mr  Hobbes  as is commonly imagin'd  Plato  endeavours to refute an Hypothesis very like it in the d d and th Books de Republica  Cicero  on the contrary supposes it certain and universally acknowledged in the following beautiful Passage which is the only Authority I shall cite for these Reasonings Not imitating in this the Example of  Puffendorf  nor even that of  Grotius  who think a Verse from  Ovid  or  Plautus  or  Petronius  a necessary Warrant for every moral Truth or the Example of Mr  Woolaston  who has constant Recourse to  Hebrew  and  Arabic  Authors for the same Purpose  Quis enim vestrûm judices ignorat ita naturam rerum tulisse ut quodam tempore homines nondum neque naturali neque civili jure descripto fusi per agros ac dispersi vagarentur tantumque haberent quantum manu ac viribus per caedem ac vulnera aut eripere aut retinere potuissent Qui igitur primi virtute consilio praestanti extiterunt ii perspecto genere humanae docilitatis atque ingenii dissipatos unum in locum congregarunt cosque ex feritate illa ad justitiam ac mansuetudinem transdexerunt Tum res ad communem utilitatem quas publicas appellamus tum

nulla sunt vis dominetur necesse est Haec vident omnes  Pro Sext l    WHETHER such a Condition of human Nature could ever exist or if it did could continue so long as to merit the Appellation of a  State  may justly be doubted Men are necessarily born in a Familysociety at least and are train'd up by their Parents to some Rule of Conduct and Behaviour But this must be admitted that if such a State of mutual War and Violence was ever real the Suspension of all Laws of Justice from their absolute Inutility is a necessary and infallible Consequence  THE more we vary our Views of human Life and the newer and more unusual the Lights are in which we survey it the more shall we be convinc'd that the Origin here assign'd for the Virtue of Justice is real and satisfactory  WERE there a Species of Creatures intermingied with Men which tho' rational were possest of such  inferior Strength both of Body and Mind that they were incapable of all Resistance and could never upon the highest Provocation make us feel the Effects of their Resentment the necessary Consequence I think is that we should be bound by the Laws of Humanity to give gentle Usage to these Creatures but should not properly speaking lie under any Restraint of Justice with Regard to them nor could they possess any Right or Property exclusive of such arbitrary Lords Our Intercourse with them could not be call'd Society which supposes a Degree of Equality but absolute Command on the one Side and servile Obedience on the other Whatever we covet they must instantly resign Our Permission is the only Tenure by which they hold their Possessions Our Compassion and Kindness the only Check by which they curb our lawless Will And as no Inconvenience ever results from the Exercise of a Power so firmly establish'd in Nature the Restraints of Justice and Property being totally  useless  would never have Place in so unequal a Confederacy  THIS is plainly the Situation of Men with regard to Animals and how far these may be said to possess Reason I leave it to others to determine The great Superiority of civiliz'd  Europeans  above barbarous  Indians  tempted us to imagine ourselves on  the same Footing with regard to them and made us throw off all Restraints of Justice and even of Humanity in our Treatment of them In many Nations the female Sex are reduc'd to like Slavery and are render'd incapable of all Property in Opposition to their lordly Masters But tho' the Males when united have in all Countries brute Force sufficient to maintain this severe Tyranny yet such are the Insinuation Address and Charms of their fair Companions that they are commonly able to break the Confederacy and share with the superior Sex in all the Rights and Privileges of Society  WERE the human Species so fram'd by Nature as that each Individual possest within himself every Faculty requisite both for his own Preservation and for the Propagation of his Kind Were all Society and Intercourse cut off betwixt Man and Man by the primary Intention of the supreme Creator It seems evident that so solitary a Being would be as much incapable of Justice as of social Discourse and Conversation Where mutual Regards and Forbearance serve no Manner of Purpose they would never direct the Conduct of any reasonable Man The headlong Course of the Passions would be check'd by no Reflection on future Consequences And as each Man is here suppos'd to love himself alone and to depend only on himself and his own  Activity for Safety and Happiness he would on every Occasion to the utmost of his Power challenge the Preference above every other Being to whom he is not bound by any Ties either of Nature or of Interest  BUT suppose the Conjunction of the Sexes to be establish'd in Nature a Family immediately arises and particular Rules being found requisite for its Subsistance these are immediately embrac'd tho' without comprehending the rest of Mankind within their Prescriptions Suppose that several Families unite together into one Society which is totally disjoin'd from all others the Rules which preserve Peace and Order enlarge themselves to the utmost Extent of that Society but being entirely useless lose their Force when carry'd one Step farther But again suppose that several distinct Societies maintain a Kind of Entercourse for mutual Convenience and Advantage the Boundaries of Justice still grow larger and larger in Proportion to the Largeness of Men's Views and the Force of their mutual Connexions History Experience Reason sufficiently instruct us in this natural Progress of human Sentiments and the gradual Encrease of our Regards to Property and Justice in Proportion as we become acquainted with the extensive  Utility  of that Virtue  PART II  IF we examine all the  particular  Laws by which Justice is directed and Property determin'd we shall still be presented with the same Conclusion The Good of Mankind is the only Object of all these Laws and Regulations Not only 'tis requisite for the Peace and Interest of Society that Men's Possessions should be separated but the Rules which we follow in making the Separation are such as can best be contriv'd to serve farther the Interests of Society  WE shall suppose that a Creature possest of Reason but unacquainted with human Nature deliberates with himself what RULES of Justice or Property would best promote public Interest and establish Peace and Security amongst Mankind His most obvious Thought would be to assign the largest Possessions to the most extensive Virtue and give every one the Power of doing Good proportion'd to his Inclination In a perfect Theocracy where a Being infinitely intelligent governs by particular Volitions this Rule would certainly have Place and might serve the wisest Purposes But were Mankind to execute such a Law so great is the Uncertainty of Merit both from its natural Obscurity  and from the Selfconceit of each Individual that no determinate Rule of Conduct would ever result from it and the total Dissolution of Society must be the immediate Consequence Fanatics may suppose  that Dominion is founded in Grace  and  that Saints alone inherit the Earth  but the civil Magistrate very justly puts these sublime Theorists on the same Footing with common Robbers and teaches them by the severest Discipline that a Rule which in Speculation may seem the most advantageous to Society may yet be found in Practice totally pernicious and destructive  THAT there were  religious  Fanatics of this kind in  England  during the civil Wars we learn from History tho' 'tis probable that the obvious  Tendency  of these Principles excited such Horrour in Mankind as soon oblig'd the dangerous Enthusiasts to renounce or at least conceal their Tenets Perhaps the  Levellers  who claim'd an equal Distribution of Property were a Kind of  political  Fanatics which arose from the religious Species and more openly avow'd their Pretensions as carrying a more plausible Appearance of being practicable as well as useful to human Society  IT must indeed be confest that Nature is so liberal to Mankind that were all her Presents equally  divided amongst the Species and improv'd by Art and Industry every Individual would enjoy all the Necessaries and even most of the Comforts of Life nor would ever be liable to any Ills but such as might accidentally arise from the sickly Frame and Constitution of his Body It must also be confest that wherever we depart from this Equality we rob the Poor of more Satisfaction than we add to the Rich and that the slight Gratification of a frivolous Vanity in one Individual frequently costs more than Bread to many Families and even Provinces It may appear withal that the Rule of Equality as it would be highly  useful  is not altogether  impracticable  but has taken Place at least in an imperfect Degree in some Republics particularly that of  Sparta  where it was attended as 'tis said with the most beneficial Consequences Not to mention that the  Agrarian  Laws so frequently claim'd in  Rome  and carry'd to Execution in many  Greek  Cities proceeded all of them from a general Idea of the Utility of this Principle  But Historians and even common Sense may inform us that however specious these Ideas of  perfect  Equality may seem they are really at the Bottom  impracticable  and were they not so would be extremely  pernicious  to human Society Render the Possessions of Men ever so equal their different Degrees  of Art Care and Industry will immediately break that Equality Or if you check these Virtues you reduce Society to the extremest Indigence and instead of preventing Want and Beggary in a few render it unavoidable to the whole Community The most rigorous Inquisition too is requisite to watch every Inequality on its first Appearance and the most severe Jurisdiction to punish and redress it But besides that so much Authority must soon degenerate into Tyranny and be exerted with great Partialities who can possibly be possest of it in such a Situation as is here suppos'd Perfect Equality of Possessions destroying all Subordination weakens extremely the Authority of Magistracy and must reduce all Power nearly to a Level as well as Property  WE may conclude therefore that in order to establish Laws for the Regulation of Property we must be acquainted with the Nature and Situation of Man must reject Appearances which may be false tho' specious and must search for those Rules which are on the whole most  useful  and  beneficial  Vulgar Sense and slight Experience are sufficient for this Purpose where Men give not way to too selfish Avidity or too extensive Enthusiasm  WHO sees not for Instance that whatever is produc'd or improv'd by a Man's Art or Industry ought for ever to be secur'd to him in order to give Encouragement to such  useful  Habits and Accomplishments That the Property ought also to descend to Children and Relations for the same  useful  Purpose That it may be alienated by Consent in order to beget that Commerce and Intercourse which is so  beneficial  to human Society And that all Contracts and Promises ought carefully to be fulfill'd in order to secure mutual Trust and Confidence by which the general  Interest  of Mankind is so much promoted  EXAMINE the Writers on the Laws of Nature and you will always find that whatever Principles they set out with they are sure to terminate here at last and to assign as the ultimate Reason for every Rule they establish the Convenience and Necessities of Mankind A Concession thus extorted in Opposition to Systems has more Authority than if it had been made in Prosecution of them  WHAT other Reason indeed could Writers ever give why this must be  mine  and that  yours  since uninstructed Nature surely never made any such Distinction These Objects are of themselves  foreign to us they are totally disjoin'd and separate and nothing but the general Interests of Society can form the Connection  SOMETIMES the Interests of Society may require a Rule of Justice in a particular Case but may no  determine any particular Rule amongst several which are all equally beneficial In that Case the slightest  Analogies  are laid hold of in order to prevent that Indifference and Ambiguity which would be the Source of perpetual Quarrels and Dissentions Thus Possession alone and first Possession is suppos'd to convey Property where nobody else has any precedent Claim and Pretension Many of the Reasonings of Lawyers are of this analogical Nature and depend on very slight Connexions of the Imagination  Is it ever scrupled in extraordinary Cases to violate all Regard to the private Property of Individuals and sacrifice to public Interest a Distinction which had been establish'd for the Sake of that Interest The Safety of the People is the supreme Law All other particular Laws are subordinate to it and dependant on it And if in the  common  Course of Things they be followed and regarded 'tis only because the public Safety and Interest  commonly  demand so equal and impartial an Administration  SOMETIMES both  Utility  and  Analogy  fail and leave the Laws of Justice in total Uncertainty Thus 'tis highly requisite that Prescription or long Possession should convey Property but what Number of Days or Months or Years should be sufficient for that Purpose 'tis impossible for Reason alone to determine  Civil Laws  here supply the Place of the natural  Code  and assign different Terms for Prescription according to the different  Utilities  propos'd by the Legislator Bills of Exchange and promissory Notes by the Laws of most Countries prescribe sooner than Bonds and Mortgages and Contracts of a more formal Nature  IN general we may observe that all Questions of Property are subordinate to the Authority of civil Laws which extend restrain modify and alter the Rules of natural Justice according to the particular  Convenience  of each Community The Laws have or ought to have a constant Reference to the Constitution of Government the Manners the Climate the Religion the Commerce the Situation of each Society A late Author of great Genius as well as extensive Learning has prosecuted this Subject at large and has establish'd from these Principles the best System of political Knowledge that  perhaps has ever yet been communicated to the World  The Author of  L'Esprit des Loix  This illustrious Writer however sets out with a different Theory and supposes all Right to be founded on certain  Rapports  or Relations which is a System that in my Opinion never will reconcile with true Philosophy Father  Malebranche  as far as I can learn was the first that started this abstract Theory of Morals which was afterwards adopted by Dr  Clarke  and others and as it excludes all Sentiment and pretends to found every Thing on Reason it has not wanted Followers in this philosophic Age See  Essay  and  Appendix  With gard to Justice the Virtue here treated of the Inference against this Theory seems short and conclusive Property is allow'd to be dependant on civil Laws Civil Laws are allow'd to have no Object but the Interest of Society This therefore must be allow'd to be the sole Foundation of Property and Justice Not to mention that our Obligation itself to obey the Magistrate and his Laws is founded on nothing but the Interests of Society  If the Ideas of Justice sometimes do not follow the Dispositions of civil Law we shall find that these Cases instead of Objections are Confirmations of the Theory deliver'd above Where a civil Law is so perverse as to cross all the Interests of Society it loses all its Authority and Men judge by the Ideas of natural Justice which are conformable to those Interests Sometimes also civil Laws for useful Purposes require a Ceremony or Form and where that is wanting their Decrees run contrary to the usual Tenor of Justice but one who takes Advantage of such Chicanes is not regarded as an honest Man Thus the Interests of Society require that Contracts be fulfill'd and there is not a more material Article either of natural or civil Justice But the Omission of a trifling Circumstance will often by Law invalidate a Contract  in foro humano  but not  in foro conscientiae  as Divines express themselves In these Cases the Magistrate is suppos'd only to withdraw his Power of enforcing the Right not to have alter'd the Right Where his Intention extends to the Right and is conformable to the Interests of Society it never fails to alter the Right a clear Proof of the Origin of Justice and of Property as assign'd above    WHAT is a Man's Property  Any Thing which it is lawful for him and for him alone to use  But what Rule have we by which we can distinguish these Objects  Here we must have Recourse to Statutes Customs Precedents Analogies and a hundred other Circumstances some of which are constant and inflexible some variable and arbitrary But the ultimate Point in which they all professedly terminate is the Interest and Happiness of human Society Where this enters not into Consideration nothing can appear more whimsical unnatural and even superstitious than all or most of the Laws of Justice and of Property  THOSE who ridicule vulgar Superstitions and expose the Folly of particular Regards to Meats Days Places Postures Apparel have an easy Task while they consider all the Qualities and Relations of the Objects and discover no adequate Cause for that Affection or Antipathy Veneration or Horrour which have so mighty an Influence over a considerable Part of Mankind A  Syrian  would have starv'd rather than taste Pigeon an  Egyptian  would  not have approach'd Bacon But if these Species of Food be examin'd by the Senses of Sight Smell or Taste or scrutiniz'd by the Sciences of Chymistry Medicine or Physics no Difference is ever found betwixt them and any other Species nor can that precise Circumstance be pitch'd on which may afford a just Foundation for the religious Passion A Fowl on Thursday is lawful Food on Friday abominable Eggs in this House and in this Diocese are permitted during Lent a hundred Paces farther to eat them is a damnable Sin This Earth or Building▪ yesterday was prophane today by the muttering of certain Words it has become holy and sacred Such Reflections as these in the Mouth of a Philosopher one may safely say are too obvious to have any Influence because they must always to every Man occur at first Sight and where they prevail not of themselves they are surely obstructed by Education Prejudice and Passion not by Ignorance or Mistake  IT may appear to a careless View or rather a too abstracted Reflection that there enters a like Superstition into all the Regards of Justice and that if a Man subjects its Objects or what we call Property to the same Scrutiny of Sense and Science he will not by the most accurate Enquiry find any Foundation for the Difference made by moral  Sentiment I may lawfully nourish myself from this Tree but the Fruit of another of the same Species ten Paces off 'tis criminal for me to touch Had I wore this Apparel an Hour ago I had merited the severest Punishment but a Man by pronouncing a few magical Syllables has now render'd it fit for my Use and Service Were this House plac'd in the neighbouring Territory it had been immoral for me to dwell in it but being built on this Side the River it is subject to a different municipal Law and I incur no Blame or Censure The same Species of Reasoning it may be thought which so successfully exposes Superstition is also applicable to Justice nor is it possible in the one Case more than in the other to point out in the Object that precise Quality or Circumstance which is the Foundation of the Sentiment  BUT there is this material Difference betwixt  Superstition  and  Justice  that the former is frivolous useless and burthensome the latter is absolutely requisite to the Wellbeing of Mankind and Existence of Society When we abstract from this Circumstance for 'tis too apparent ever to be overlookt it must be confest that all Regards to Right and Property seem entirely without Foundation as much as the grossest and most vulgar Superstition Were the Interests of Society no way concern'd 'tis as unintelligible why another's articulating certain Sounds  implying Consent should change the Nature of my Actions with regard to a particular Object as why the reciting of a Liturgy by a Priest in a certain Habit and Posture should dedicate a Heap of Brick and Timber and render it thenceforth and for ever sacred  'Tis evident that the Will or Consent alone never transfers Property nor causes the Obligation of a Promise for the same Reasoning extends to both but the will must be exprest by Words or Signs in order to impose a Tye upon any Man The Expression being once brought in as subservient to the Will soon becomes the principal Part of the Promise nor will a Man be less bound by his Word tho' he secretly give a different Direction to his Intention and with hold the Assent of his Mind But tho' the Expression makes on most Occasions the whole of the Promise yet it does not always so and one who should make use of any Expression of which he knows not the Meaning and which he uses without any Sense of the Consequences would not certainly be bound by it Nay tho' he know its Meaning yet if he uses it in Jest only and with such Signs as show evidently he has no serious Intention of binding himself he would not lie under any Obligation of Performance but 'tis necessary that the Words be a perfect Expression of the Will without any contrary Signs Nay even this we must not carry so far as to imagine that one whom by our Quickness of Understanding we conjecture from certain Signs to have an Intention of deceiving us is not bound by his Expression or verbal Promise if we accept of it but must limit this Conclusion to those Cases where the Signs are of a different Nature from those of Deceit All those Contradictions are easily accounted for if Justice arises entirely from its Usefulness to Society but will never be explain'd on any other Hypothesis  THESE Reflections are far from weakening the Obligations of Justice or diminishing any Thing from the most sacred Attention to Property On the contrary such Sentiments must acquire new Force from the present Reasoning For what stronger Foundation can be desir'd or conceiv'd for any Duty than to observe that human Society or even human Nature could not subsist without the Establishment of it and will still arrive at greater Degrees of Happiness and Perfection the more inviolable the Regard is which is pay'd to that Duty  'Tis remarkable that the moral Decisions of the  Jesuits  and other relax'd Casuists were commonly form'd in Prosecution of some such Subtilities of Reasoning as are here pointed at and proceded as much from the Habit of scholastic Refinement as from any Corrruption of the Heart if we may follow the Authority of Monsr  Bayle  See his Dictionary Article  Loyola  And why has the Indignation of Mankind rose so strong against these Casuists but because every one perceiv'd that human Society could not subsist were such Practices authoriz'd and that Morals must always be handled with a View to public Interest more than philosophical Regularity If the secret Direction of the Intention said every Man of Sense could invalidate a Contract where is our Security And yet a metaphysical Schoolman might think that where an Intention was suppos'd to be requifite if that Intention really had not Place no Consequence ought to follow and no Obligation be impos'd The casuistical Subtilities may not be greater than the Subtilities of Lawyers hinted at above but as the former are  pernicious  and the latter  Innocent  and even  necessary  this is the Reason of the very different Re  eption they meet with from the World  THUS we seem upon the Whole to have attain'd a Knowledge of the Force of that Principle here insisted on and can determine what Degree of Esteem or moral Approbation may result from Reflections on public Interest and Utility The Necessity of Justice to the Support of Society is the SOLE Foundation of that Virtue and since no moral Excellence is more highly esteem'd we may conclude that this Circumstance of Usefulness has in general the strongest Energy and most entire Command over our Sentiments It must therefore be the Source of a considerable Part of the Merit ascrib'd to Humanity Benevolence Friendship public Spirit and other social Virtues of that Stamp as it is the SOLE Source of the moral Approbation pay'd to Fidelity Justice Veracity Integrity and those other estimable and useful Qualities and Principles 'Tis entirely agreeable to the Rules of Philosophy and even of common Reason where any Principle has been found to have a great Force and Energy in one Instance to ascribe to it a like Energy in all similar Instances  This is Sir  Isaac Newton  's second Rule of philosophizing  Principia  Lib    SECTION IV  Of POLITICAL SOCIETY  HAD every Man sufficient  Sagacity  to perceive at all Times the strong Interest which binds him to the Observance of Justice and Equity and  Strength of Mind  sufficient to persevere in a steady Adherence to a general and a distant Interest in Opposition to the Allurements of present Pleasure and Advantage There had never in that Case been any such Thing as Government or political Society but each Man following his natural Liberty had liv'd in entire Peace and Harmony with all others What Need of positive Laws where natural Justice is of itself a sufficient Restraint Why create Magistrates where there never arises any Disorder or Iniquity Why abridge our native Freedom when in every Instance the utmost Exertion of it is found innocent and beneficial 'Tis evident that if Government were totally useless it never could have Place and that the SOLE Foundation of the  Duty of ALLEGIANCE is the  Advantage  which it procures to Society by preserving Peace and Order amongst Mankind  WHEN a Number of political Societies are erected and maintain a great Entercourse together a new Set of Rules are immediately discover'd to be  useful  in that particular Situation and accordingly take place under the Title of LAWS of NATIONS Of this Kind are the Sacredness of the Persons of Ambassadors abstaining from poison'd Arms Quarter in War with others of that Kind which are plainly calculated for the  Advantage  of States and Kingdoms in their Entercourse with each other  THE Rules of Justice such as prevail amongst Individuals are not altogether suspended amongst political Societies All Princes pretend a Regard to the Rights of others and some no doubt without Hypocrisy Alliances and Treaties are every Day made betwixt independent States which would only be so much Waste of Parchment if they were not found by Experience to have  some  Influence and Authority But here is the Difference betwixt Kingdoms and Individuals Human Nature cannot by any Means subsist without the Association of Individuals and that Association never could have Place were no Regard pay'd to the Laws of Equity  and Justice Disorder Confusion the War of All against All are the necessary Consequences of such a licentious Conduct But Nations can flourish without Entercourse They may even subsist in some Degree under a general War The Observance of Justice tho' useful among them is not guarded by so strong a Necessity as among Individuals and the  moral Obligation  holds Proportion with the  Usefulness  All Politicians will allow and most Philosophers that REASONS of STATE may in particular Emergencies dispence with the Rules of Justice and invalidate any Treaty or Alliance where the strict Observance of it would be prejudicial in a considerable Degree to either of the contracting Parties But nothing less than the extremest Necessity 'tis confest can justify Individuals in a Breach of Promise or an Invasion of the Properties of others  IN a confederated Commonwealth such as the  Achaean  Republic of old or the  Swiss  Cantons and United Provinces in modern Times as the League has here a peculiar  Utility  the Conditions of Union have a peculiar Sacredness and Authority and a Violation of them would be equally criminal or even more criminal than any private Injury or Injustice  THE long and helpless Infancy of Man requires the Combination of Parents for the Subsistance of their Young and that Combination requires the Virtue of CHASTITY or Fidelity to the Marriagebed Without such an  Utility  'twill readily be own'd such a Virtue would never have been thought of  The only Solution which  Plato  gives to all the Objections that might be rais'd against the Community of Women establish'd in his imaginary Commonwealth is    Scite enim istud dicitur dicetur Id quod utile sit honestumesse quod autem inutile sit turpe esse  De Rep Lib P Ex edit Serr And this Maxim will admit of no Doubt where public Utility is concern'd which is  Plato  's Meaning And indeed to what other Purpose do all the Ideas of Chastity and Modesty serve  Nisi utile est quod facimus frustra est gloria  says  Phaedrus  says  Plutarch de vitioso pudore  Nihil eorum quae damnosa sunt pulchrum est The same was the Opinion of the Stoics  Sext Emp Lib Cap    AN Infidelity of this Nature is much more  pernicious  in  Women  than in  Men  Hence the Laws of Chastity are much stricter over the one Sex than over the other  THESE Rules have all a Reference to Generation and yet Women past Childbearing are no more suppos'd to be exempted from them than those is in the Flower of their Youth and Beauty  General Rules  are often extended beyond the Principle whence they first arise and this in all Matters of Taste and Sentiment 'Tis a vulgar Story at  Paris  that during the Rage of the  Mississippi  a humpback'd Fellow went every Day into the  Ruë de Quincempoix  where the Stockjobbers met in great Crowds and was well pay'd for allowing them to make use of his Hump as a Desk in order to sign their Contracts upon it Would the Fortune he rais'd by this Invention make him a handsome Fellow tho' it be confest that personal Beauty arises very much from Ideas of Utility The Imagination is influenced by Associations of Ideas which tho' they arise at first from the Judgment are not easily alter'd by every particular Exception that occurs to us To which we may add in the present Case of Chastity that the Example of the Old would be pernicious to the Young and that Women continually thinking that a certain Time would bring them the Liberty of Indulgence would naturally advance that Period and think more lightly of this whole Duty so requisite to Society    THOSE who live in the same Family have so many Opportunities of Licences of this Kind that nothing could preserve Purity of Manners were Marriage allow'd amongst the nearest Relations or any Intercourse of Love betwixt them ratify'd by Law and Custom INCEST therefore being  pernicious  in a superior Degree has also a superior Turpitude and moral Deformity annex'd to it  WHAT is the Reason why by the  Greek  Laws one might marry a Halfsister by the Father but not by the Mother Plainly this The Manners of the  Greeks  were so reserv'd that a Man was never permitted  to approach the Women's Apartment even in the same Family unless where he visited his own Mother His Stepmother and her Children were as much shut up from him as the Women of any other Family and there was as little Danger of any criminal Intercourse betwixt them Uncles and Nieces for a like Reason might marry at  Athens  but neither these nor Halfbrothers and Sisters could contract that Alliance at  Rome  where the Intercourse was more open betwixt the Sexes Public Utility is the Cause of all these Variations  To repeat to a Man's Prejudice any Thing that escap'd him in private Conversation or to make any such Use of his private Letters is highly blam'd The free and social Intercourse of Minds must be extremely checkt where no such Rules of Fidelity are establish'd  EVEN in repeating Stories whence we can see no ill Consequences to result the giving one's Authors is regarded as a Piece of Indiscretion if not of Immorality These Stories in passing from Hand to Hand and receiving all the usual Variations frequently come about to the Persons concern'd and produce Animosities and Quarrels among People whose Intentions are the most innocent and inoffensive  To pry into Secrets to open or even read the Letters of others to play the Spy upon their Words and Looks and Actions What Habits more inconvenient in Society What Habits of consequence more blameable  THIS Principle is also the Foundation of most of the Laws of Goodmanners a Kind of lesser Morality calculated for the Ease of Company and Conversation Too much or too little Ceremony are both blam'd and every Thing that promotes Ease without an indecent Familiarity is useful and laudable  CONSTANCY in Friendships Attachments and Familiarities is commonly very laudable and is requisite to support Trust and good Correspondence in Society But in Places of general tho' casual Concourse where Health and Pleasure bring People promiscuously together public Conveniency has dispens'd with this Maxim and Custom there promotes an unreserv'd Conversation for the Time by indulging the Privilege of dropping afterwards every indifferent Acquaintance without Breach of Civility or Goodmanners  EVEN in Societies that are establish'd on Principles the most immoral and the most destructive to the Interests of the general Society there are requir'd certain Rules and Maxims which a Species of false Honour as well as private Interest engages the Members to observe Robbers and Pyrates it has often been remark'd could not maintain their pernicious Confederacy did they not establish a new distributive Justice amongst themselves and recall those Laws of Equity which they have violated with the rest of Mankind  I HATE a drinking Companion says the  Greek  Proverb who never forgets The Follies of the last Debauch should be buried in eternal Oblivion in order to give full Scope to the Follies of the next  AMONGST Nations where an immoral Gallantry if cover'd with a thin Veil of Mystery is in some Degree authoriz'd by Custom there immediately arise a Set of Rules calculated for the Conveniency of that Attachment The famous Court or Parliament of Love in  Provence  decided formally all difficult Cases of this Nature  IN Societies for Play there are Laws requir'd for the Conduct of the Game and these Laws are different  in each Game The Foundation I own of such Societies is frivolous and the Laws are in a great Measure tho' not altogether capricious and arbitrary So far is there a material Difference betwixt them and the Rules of Justice Fidelity and Loyalty The general Societies of Men are absolutely requisite for the Subsistence of the Species and the public Conveniency which regulates Morals is inviolably establish'd in the Nature of Man and of the World in which he lives The Comparison therefore in these Respects is very imperfect We may only learn from it the Necessity of Rules whereever Men have any Intercourse with each other  THEY cannot even pass each other on the Road without Rules Waggoners Coachmen and Postilions have Principles by which they give way and these are chiefly founded on mutual Ease and Convenience Sometimes also they are arbitrary or at best dependant on a Kind of capricious Analogy like many of the Reasonings of Lawyers  That the lighter Machine yields to the heavier and in Machines of the same Kind that the empty yield to the loaded this Rule is founded on Convenience That those who are going to the Capital take place of those who are coming from it this seems to be sounded on some Idea of the Dignity of the great City and of the Preference of the future to the past From like Reasons amongst Footwalkers the Righthand entitles a Man to the Wall and prevents jostling which peaceable People find very disagreeable and inconvenient    To carry the Matter farther we may observe that 'tis impossible for Men so much as to murther each other without Statutes and Maxims and an Idea of Justice and Honour War has it Laws as well as Peace and even that sportive Kind of War carried on amongst Wrestlers Boxers Cudgelplayers Gladiators is supported by fixt Principles and Regulations Common Interest and Utility beget infallibly a Standard of Right and Wrong amongst the Parties concern'd  SECTION V  Why UTILITY pleases  PART I  IT seems so natural a Thought to ascribe to their Utility the Praise which we bestow on the social Virtues that one would expect to meet with this Principle everywhere in moral Writers as the chief Foundation of their Reasoning and Inquiry In common Life we may observe that the Circumstance of Utility is always appeal'd to nor is it suppos'd that a greater Elogy can be given to any Man than to display his Usefulness to the Public and enumerate the Services he has perform'd to Mankind and Society What Praise even of an inanimate Form if the Regularity and Elegance of its Parts destroy not its Fitness for any useful Purpose And how satisfactory an Apology for any Disproportion of seeming Deformity if we can show the Necessity of that  particular Construction for the Use intended A Ship appears infinitely more beautiful to an Artist or one moderately skill'd in Navigation where its Prow is wide and swelling beyond its Poop than if it were fram'd with a precise geometrical Regularity in Contradiction to all the Laws of Mechanics A Building whose Doors and Windows were exact Squares would hurt the Eye by that very Proportion as ill adapted to the human Figure for whose Service the Fabric was intended What Wonder then that a Man whose Habits and Conduct are hurtful to Society and dangerous or pernicious to every one that has an Intercourse with him should on that Account be an Object of Disapprobation and communicate to every Spectator the strongest Sentiments of Disgust and Hatred  We ought not to imagine because an inanimate Object may be useful as well as a Man that therefore it ought also according to this System to merit the Appellation of  virtuous  The Sentiments excited by Utility are in the two Cases very different and the one is mixt with Affection Esteem Approbation  c  and not the other In like Manner an inanimate Object may have good Colour and Proportions as well as a human Figure But can we ever be in Love with the former There are a numerous Set of Passions and Sentiments of which thinking rational Beings are by the original Constitution of Nature the only proper Objects And tho' the very same Qualities be transferr'd to an insensible inanimate Being they will not excite the same Sentiments The beneficial Qualities of Herbs and Minerals are indeed sometimes call'd their  Virtues  but this is an Effect of the Caprice of Language which ought not to be regarded in Reasoning For tho' there be a Species of Approbation attending even inanimate Objects when beneficial yet this Sentiment is so weak and so different from what is directed to beneficent Magistrates or Statesmen that they ought not to be rank'd under the same Class or Appellation  A very small Variation of the Object even where the same Qualities are preserv'd will destroy a Sentiment Thus the same Beauty transferr'd to a different Sex excites no amorous Passion where Nature is not extremely perverted    BUT perhaps the Difficulty of accounting for these Effects of Usefulness or its contrary has kept Philosophers from admitting them into their Systems of Ethics and has induc'd them rather to employ any other Principle in explaining the Origin of moral Good and Evil But 'tis no just Reason for rejecting any Principle confirm'd by Experience that we can give no satisfactory Account of its Origin nor are able to resolve it into other more general Principles And if we would employ a little Thought on the present Subject we need be at no Loss to account for the Influence of Utility and to deduce it from Principles the most known and avow'd in human Nature  FROM the apparent Usefulness of the social Virtues it has readily been inferr'd by Sceptics both antient and modern that all moral Distinctions arise from Education and were at first invented and afterwards encourag'd by the Arts of Politicians in order to render Men tractable and subdue their natural Ferocity and Selfishness which incapacitated them for Society This Principle indeed of Precept and Education must be so far own'd to have a powerful Influence that it may frequently encrease or diminish beyond their natural Standard the Sentiments of Approbation or Dislike and may even in particular Instances create without any natural Principle a new Sentiment of this Kind as is evident in all superstitious Practices and Observances But that  all  moral Affection or Dislike arises from this Origin will never surely be allow'd by any judicious Enquirer Had Nature made no such Distinction founded on the original Frame and Constitution of the Mind the Words  honourable  and  shameful lovely  and  odious noble  and  despicable  never had had place in any Language nor could Politicians had they invented these Terms ever have been able to render them intelligible or make them convey any Idea to the Audience So that nothing can be more superficial than this Paradox of the Sceptics and 'twere well if in the abstruser Studies of Logics and Metaphysics  we could as easily get rid of the Cavils of that Sect as in the more practical and intelligible Sciences of Politics and Morals  THE social Virtues must therefore be allow'd to have a natural Beauty and Amiableness which at first antecedent to all Precept or Education recommends them to the Esteem of uninstructed Mankind and engages their Affections And as the Utility of these Virtues is the chief Circumstance whence they derive their Merit it follows that the End which they have a Tendency to promote must be some way agreeable to us and take hold of some natural Affection It must please either from Considerations of Selfinterest or from more generous Motives and Regards  IT has often been asserted that as every Man has a strong Connexion with Society and perceives the Impossibility of his solitary Subsistence he becomes on that Account favourable to all those Habits or Principles which promote Order in Society and ensure to him the quiet Possession of so inestimable a Blessing As much as we value our own Happiness and Welfare as much must we value the Practice of Justice and Humanity by which alone the social Confederacy can be maintain'd and every Man reap the Fruits of mutual Protection and Assistance  THIS Deduction of Morals from Selflove or a Regard to private Interest is a very obvious Thought and has not arisen altogether from the wanton Sallies and sportive Assaults of the Sceptics To mention no others  Polybius  one of the gravest and most judicious as well as most moral Writers of Antiquity has assign'd this selfish Origin to all our Sentiments of Virtue  Undutifulness to Parents is disapprov'd of by Mankind  Ingratitude for a like Reason tho' he seems there to mix a more generous Regard  Lib Cap Perhaps the Historian only meant that our Sympathy and Humanity was more enlivened by our considering the Similarity of our Case with that of the Persons suffering which is a just Sentiment  But tho' the solid practical Sense of that Author and his Aversion to all vain Subtilties render his Authority on the present Subject very considerable yet this is not an Affair to be decided by Authority and the Voice of Nature and Experience seems plainly to oppose the selfish Theory  WE frequently bestow Praises on virtuous Actions perform'd in very distant Ages and remote Countries where the utmost Subtilty of Imagination would not discover any Appearance of Selfinterest or find any  Connexion of our present Happiness and Security with Events so widely separated from us  A generous a brave a noble Deed perform'd by an Adversary commands our Approbation while in its Consequences it may be acknowledged prejudicial to our particular Interests  WHERE private Advantage concurs with general Affection for Virtue we readily perceive and avow the Mixture of these distinct Sentiments which have a very different Feeling and Influence on the Mind We praise perhaps with more Alacrity where the generous humane Action contributes to our particular Interest But the Topics of Praise we insist on are very wide of this Circumstance And we may attempt to bring over others to our Sentiments without endeavouring to convince them that they reap any Advantage from the Actions which we recommend to their Approbation and Applause  FRAME the Model of a praiseworthy Character consisting of all the most amiable moral Virtues Give Instances in which these display themselves after an eminent and extraordinary Manner You readily engage the Esteem and Approbation of all your Audience who never so much as enquir'd in what Age and Country the Person liv'd who possest  these noble Qualities A Circumstance however of all others the most material to Selflove or a Concern for our own individual Happiness  ONCE on a Time a Statesmen in the Shock and Concurrence of Parties prevail'd so far as to procure by his Eloquence the Banishment of an able Adversary whom he secretly follow'd offering him Money for his Support during his Exile and soothing him with Topics of Consolation on his Misfortunes  Alas  cries the banish'd Statesman  with what Regret must I leave my Friends in this City where even Enemies are so generous  Virtue tho' in an Enemy here pleas'd him And we also give it the just Tribute of Praise and Approbation nor do we retract these Sentiments when we hear that the Action past at  Athens  about two thousand Years ago and that the Persons Names were  Eschines  and  Demosthenes  WHAT is that to me  There are few Occasions when this Question is not pertinent And had it that universal infallible Influence suppos'd it would turn into Ridicule every Composition and almost every Conversation which contain any Praise or Censure of Men and Manners  'Tis but a weak Subterfuge when press'd by these Facts and Arguments to say that we transport ourselves by the Force of Imagination into distant Ages and Countries and consider the Advantage which we should have reapt from these Characters had we been Contemporaries and had any Commerce with the Persons 'Tis not conceivable how a  real  Sentiment or Passion can ever arise from a known  imaginary  Interest especially when our  real  Interest is still kept in View and is often acknowledg'd to be entirely distinct from the imaginary and even sometimes opposite to it  A Man brought to the Brink of a Precipice cannot look down without trembling and the Sentiment of  imaginary  Danger actuates him in Opposition to the Opinion and Belief of  real  Safety But the Imagination is here assisted by the Presence of a striking Object and yet prevails not except it be also aided by Novelty and the unusual Appearance of the Object Custom soon reconciles us to Heights and Precipices and wears off these false and delusive Terrors The Reverse is observable in the Estimates we form of Characters and Manners and the more we habituate ourselves to an accurate Scrutiny of the moral Species the more delicate Feeling do we acquire of the most minute Distinctions betwixt Vice  and Virtue Such frequent Occasion indeed have we in common Life to pronounce all Kinds of moral Determinations that no Object of this Kind can be new or unusual to us nor could any  false  Views or Prepossessions maintain their Ground against an Experience so common and familiar Experience and Custom being chiefly what form the Associations of Ideas 'tis impossible that any Association could establish and support itself in direct Opposition to these Principles  USEFULNESS is agreeable and engages our Approbation This is a Matter of Fact confirm'd by daily Observation But  useful  For what For some Body's Interest surely Whose Interest then Not our own only For our Approbation frequently extends farther It must therefore be the Interest of those who are serv'd by the Character or Action approv'd of and then we may conclude however remote are not totally indifferent to us By opening up this Principle we shall discover the great Secret of moral Distinctions  PART II  SELFLOVE is a Principle in human Nature of such extensive Energy and the Interest of each Individual is in general so closely connected with that of Community that those Philosophers were excusable who fancy'd that all our Concern for the Public might perhaps be resolv'd into a Concern for our own Happiness and Preservation They saw every Moment Instances of Approbation or Blame Satisfaction or Displeasure towards Characters and Actions they denominated the Objects of these Sentiments  Virtues  or  Vices  they observ'd that the former had a Tendency to encrease the Happiness and the latter the Misery of Society they ask'd if it was possible we could have any general Concern for Society or any disinterested Resentment of the Welfare or Injury of others they found it simpler to consider all these Sentiments as Modifications of Selflove and they discover'd a Pretext at least for this Unity of Principle in that close Union of Interest which is so observable betwixt the Public and each Individual  BUT notwithstanding this frequent Confusion of Interests 'tis easy to attain what natural Philosophers after my Lord  Bacon  have affected to call  the  Experimentum crucis  or that Experiment which points out the Way we should follow in any Doubt or Ambiguity We have found Instances wherein private Interest was separate from public wherein it was even contrary And yet we observ'd the moral Sentiment to continue notwithstanding this Disjunction of Interests And wherever these distinct Interests sensibly concur'd we always found a sensible Encrease of the Sentiment and a more warm Affection to Virtue and Detestation of Vice or what we properly call  Gratitude  and  Revenge  Compell'd by these Instances we must renounce the Theory which accounts for every moral Sentiment by the Principle of Selflove We must adopt a more public Affection and allow that the Interests of Society are not even on their own Account altogether indifferent to us Usefulness is only a Tendency to a certain End and 'tis a Contradiction in Terms that any Thing pleases as Means to an End where the End itself does no way affect us If therefore Usefulness be a Source of moral Sentiment and if this Usefulness be not always consider'd with a Reference to Self it follows that every Thing which contributes to the Happiness of Society recommends itself directly to our Approbation and Goodwill Here is a Principle which accounts in great Part for the Origin of Morality And what need we seek  for abstruse and remote Systems when there occurs one so obvious and natural  'Tis needless to push our Researches so far as to ask why we have Humanity or a Fellowfeeling with others 'Tis sufficient that this is experienc'd to be a Principle in human Nature We must stop somewhere in our Examination of Causes and there are in every Science some general Principles beyond which we cannot hope to find any Principle more general No Man is absolutely indifferent to the Happiness and Misery of others The first has a natural Tendency to give Pleasure the second Pain This every one may find in himself It is not probable that these Principles can be resolv'd into Principles more simple and universal whatever Attempts may have been made to that Purpose But if it were possible it belongs not to the present Subject and we may here safely consider these Principles as original Happy if we can render all the Consequences sufficiently plain and perspicuous    HAVE we any Difficulty to comprehend the Force of Humanity and Benevolence Or to conceive that the very Aspect of Happiness Joy Prosperity gives Pleasure that of Pain Sufferance Sorrow communicates Uneasiness The human Countenance says  Horace  Uti ridentibus arrident ita flentibus adflent  Humani vultus HOR  borrows Smiles or Tears from the human Countenance Reduce a Person to Solitude and he loses all Enjoyment except merely of the speculative Kind and that because the Movements of his Heart are not forwarded by correspondent  Movements in his Fellowcreatures The Signs of Sorrow and Mourning tho' arbitrary affect us with Melancholy but the natural Symptoms Tears and Cries and Groans never fail to infuse Compassion and Uneasiness And if the Effects of Misery touch us in so lively a Manner can we be suppos'd altogether insensible or indifferent towards its Causes when a malicious or treacherous Character and Behaviour is presented to us  WE enter I shall suppose into a convenient warm wellcontriv'd Apartment We necessarily receive a Pleasure from its very Survey because it presents us with the pleasing Ideas of Ease Satisfaction and Enjoyment The hospitable goodhumour'd humane Landlord appears This Cirstance surely must embellish the whole nor can we easily forbear reflecting with Pleasure on the Satisfaction and Enjoyment which results to every one from his Intercourse and Goodoffices  HIS whole Family by the Freedom Ease Confidence and calm Satisfaction diffus'd over their Countenances sufficiently express their Happiness I have a pleasing Sympathy in the Prospect of so much Joy and can never consider the Source of it without the most agreeable Emotions  HE tells me that an oppressive and powerful Neighbour had attempted to dispossess him of his Inheritance and had long disturb'd all his innocent and social Enjoyments I feel an immediate Indignation arise in me against such Violence and Injury  BUT 'tis no Wonder he adds that a private Wrong should proceed from a Man who had enslav'd Provinces depopulated Cities and made the Field and Scaffold stream with human Blood I am struck with Horror at the Prospect of so much Misery and am actuated by the strongest Antipathy against its Author  IN general 'tis certain that wherever we go whatever we reflect on or converse about every Thing still presents us with the View of human Happiness or Misery and excites in our Breasts a sympathetic Movement of Pleasure or Uneasiness In our serious Occupations in our careless Amusements this Principle still exerts its active Energy  A MAN who enters the Theatre is immediately struck with the View of so great a Multitude participating of one common Amusement and experiences from their very Aspect a superior Sensibility  or Disposition of being affected with every Sentiment which he shares with his Fellowcreatures  HE observes the Actors to be animated by the Appearance of a full Audience and rais'd to a Degree of Enthusiasm which they cannot command in any solitary or calm Moment  EVERY Movement of the Theatre by a skillful Poet is communicated as it were by Magic to the Spectators who weep tremble resent rejoice and are enflam'd with all the Variety of Passions which actuate the several Personages of the Drama  WHERE any Event crosses our Wishes and interrupts the Happiness of the favourite Personages we feel a sensible Anxiety and Concern But where their Sufferings proceed from the Treachery Cruelty or Tyranny of an Enemy our Breasts are affected with the liveliest Resentment against the Author of these Calamities  'TIS here esteem'd contrary to the Rules of Art to represent any Thing cool and indifferent A distant Friend or a Confident who has no immediate Interest in the Catastrophe ought if possible to be avoided by the Poet as communicating a like  Indifference to the Audience and checking the Progress of the Passions  No Species of Poetry is more entertaining than  Pastoral  and every one is sensible that the chief Source of its Pleasure arises from those Images of a gentle and tender Tranquillity which it represents in its Personages and of which it communicates a like Sentiment to the Readers  Sannazarius  who transfer'd the Scene to the Seashore tho' he presented the most magnificent Object in Nature is confest to have err'd in his Choice The Idea of Toil Labour and Danger suffer'd by the Fishermen is painful by an unavoidable Sympathy which attends every Conception of human Happiness or Misery  WHEN I was twenty says a  French  Poet  Ovid  was my Choice Now I am forty I declare for  Horace  We enter to be sure more readily into Sentiments that resemble those we feel every Moment But no Passion when well represented can be altogether indifferent to us because there is none of which every Man has not within him at least the Seeds and first Principles 'Tis the Business of Poetry to approach every Object by lively Imagery and Description and make it look like Truth and Reality A certain Proof that wherever  that Reality is found our Minds are dispos'd to be strongly affected by it  ANY recent Event or Piece of News by which the Fortunes of States Provinces or many Individuals are affected is extremely interesting even to those whose Welfare is not immediately engag'd Such Intelligence is propagated with Celerity heard with Avidity and enquir'd into with Attention and Concern The Interests of Society appear on this Occasion to be in some Degree the Interests of each Individual The Imagination is sure to be affected tho' the Passions excited may not always be so strong and steady as to have great Influence on the Conduct and Behaviour  THE Perusal of a History seems a calm Entertainment but would be no Entertainment at all did not our Hearts beat with correspondent Movements to those described by the Historian  Thucydides  and  Guicciardin  support with Difficulty our Attention while the former describes the trivial Rencounters of the small Cities of  Greece  and the latter the harmless Wars of  Pisa  The few Persons interested and the small Interest fill not the Imagination and engage not the Affections The deep Distress of the numerous  Athenian  Army before  Syracuse  the Danger which so nearly threatens  Venice  these excite Compassion these move Terror and Anxiety  THE indifferent uninteresting Stile of  Suetonius  equally with the masterly Pencil of  Tacitus  may convince us of the cruel Depravity of  Nero  or  Tiberius  But what a Difference of Sentiment While the former coldly relates the Facts and the latter sets before our Eyes the venerable Figures of a  Soranus  and a  Thrasea  intrepid in their Fate and only mov'd by the melting Sorrows of their Friends and Kindred What Sympathy then touches every human Heart What Indignation against the inhuman Tyrant whose causeless Fear or unprovok'd Malice gave rise to such detestable Barbarity  IF we bring these Subjects nearer If we remove all Suspicion of Fiction and Deceit What powerful Concern is excited and how much superior in many Instances to the narrow Attachments of Selflove and private Interest Popular Sedition Party Zeal a devoted Obedience to factious Leaders these are some of the most visible tho' less laudable Effects of this social Sympathy in human Nature  THE Frivolousness of the Subject too we may observe is not able to detach us entirely from what carries an Image of human Sentiment and Affection  WHEN a Person stutters and pronounces with Difficulty we even sympathize with this trivial Uneasiness and suffer for him And 'tis a Rule in Criticism that every Combination of Syllables or Letters which gives Pain to the Organs of Speech in the Recital appears also from a Species of Sympathy harsh and disagreeable to the Ear Nay when we run over a Book with our Eye we are sensible of such unharmonious Composition because we still imagine that a Person recites it to us and suffers from the Pronunciation of these jarring Sounds So delicate is our Sympathy  EASY and unconstrain'd Postures and Motions are always beautiful An Air of Health and Vigour is agreeable Cloaths that warm without burthening the Body that cover without imprisoning the Limbs are wellfashion'd In every Judgment of Beauty the Sentiments are Feelings of the Persons affected enter into Consideration and communicate to the Spectators similar Touches of Pain or Pleasure  Decentior equus cujus astricta sunt illia sed idem velocior Pulcher aspectu sit athleta cujus lacertos exercitatis expressit idem certamini paratior Numquam enim  species  ab  utilitate  dividitur Sed hoc quidem discernere modici judicii est  Quintilian Inst Lib Cap    What Wonder then if we can pronounce no Sentence concerning the Characters and Conduct of Men without considering the Tendencies of their Actions and the Happiness or Misery which thence arises to Society What Association of Ideas would ever operate were that Principle here totally inactive  In Proportion to the Station which a Man possesses according to the Relations in which he is plac'd we always expect from him a greater or less Degree of God and when disappointed blame his Inutility and much more do we blame him if any Ill or Prejudice arises from his Conduct and Behaviour When the Interests of one Country interfere with those of another we estimate the Merits of a Statesman by the Good or Ill which results to his own country from his Measures and Councils without Regard to the Prejudice he brings on its Enemies and Rivals His Fellowcitizens are the Objects which lie nearest the Eye while we determine his Character And as Nature has implanted in every one a superior Affection to his own Country we never expect any Regard to distant nations where the smallest Competition arises Not to mention that while every man consults the Good of his own Community we are sensible that the general Interest of Mankind is better promoted than by any loose indeterminate Views to the Good of a Species whence no beneficial Action could ever result for want of a duly limited Object on which they could exert themselves    IF any Man from a cold Insensibility or narrow Selfishness of Temper is unaffected with the Images of human Happiness or Misery he must be equally indifferent to the Images of Vice and Virtue As on the other Hand 'tis always found that a warm Concern for the Interests of our Species is attended with a delicate Feeling of all moral Distinctions a strong Resentment of Injury done to Men a lively Approbation of their Welfare In this Particular tho' great Superiority is observable of one Man above another yet none are so entirely indifferent to the Interest of their Fellowcreatures as to perceive no Distinctions of moral Good and Evil in consequence of the different Tendencies of Actions and Principles How indeed can we suppose it possible of any one who wears a human Heart that if there be subjected to his Censure one Character or System of Conduct which is beneficial and another which is pernicious to his Species or Community he will not so much as give a cool Preference to the former or ascribe to it the smallest Merit or Regard Let us suppose such a Person ever so selfish let private Interest have ingrost ever so much his Attention yet in Instances where that is not concern'd he must unavoidably feel  some  Propensity to the Good of Mankind and make it an Object of Choice if every Thing else be equal  Would any Man that is walking alone tread just as willingly on another's gouty Toes whom he has no Quarrel with as on the hard Flint and Pavement There is here surely a Difference in the Case We surely take into Consideration the Happiness and Misery of others in weighing the several Motives of Action and incline to the former where no private Regards draw us to seek our own Promotion or Advantage by the Injury of our FellowCreatures And if the Principles of Humanity are capable in many Instances of influencing our Actions they must at all Times have  some  Authority over our Sentiments and give us a general Approbation of what is useful to Society and Blame of what is dangerous or pernicious The Degrees of these Sentiments may be the Subject of Controversy but the Reality of their Existence one should think must be admitted in every Theory or System  A CREATURE absolutely malicious and spiteful were there any such in Nature must be worse than indifferent to the Images of Vice and Virtue All his Sentiments must be inverted and directly opposite to those which prevail in the human Species Whatever contributes to the Good of Mankind as it crosses the constant Bent of his Wishes and Desires must produce Uneasiness and Disapprobation and on the contrary whatever is the Source of Disorder  order and Misery in Society must for the same Reason be regarded with Pleasure and Complacency  Timon  who probably from his affected Spleen more than any inveterate Malice was denominated the Manhater embrac'd  Alcibiades  'tis said with great Fondness  Go on my Boy  cries he  Acquire the Confidence of the People You will one Day I foresee be the Cause of great Calamities to them  Plutarch in vita Alc  Could we admit the two Principles of the  Manichaeans  'tis an infallible Consequence that their Sentiments of human Actions as well as of every Thing else must be totally opposite and that every Instance of Justice and Humanity from its necessary Tendency must please the one Deity and displease the other All Mankind so far resemble the good Principle that where Interest or Revenge or Envy perverts not our Disposition we are always enclin'd from our natural Philanthropy to give the Preference to the Happiness of Society and consequently to Virtue above its opposite Absolute unprovok'd disinterested Malice has never perhaps Place in any human Breast or if it had must there pervert all the Sentiments of Morals as well as the Feelings of Humanity If the Cruelty of  Nero  be allow'd altogether voluntary and not rather the Effect of constant Fear and Resentment 'tis evident that  Tigellinus  preferably to  Seneca  or  Burrhus  must have possest his steady and uniform Approbation  A STATESMAN or Patriot that serves our own Country in our own Time has always a more passionate Regard paid him than one whose beneficial Influence operated on distant Ages or remote Nations where the Good resulting from his generous Humanity being less connected with us seems more obscure and affects us with a less lively Sympathy We may own the Merit to be equally great tho' our Sentiments are not rais'd to an equal Height in both Cases The Judgment here corrects the Inequalities of our internal Emotions and Perceptions in like Manner as it preserves us from Error in the several Variations of Images presented to our external Senses The same Object at a double Distance really throws on the Eye a Picture of but half the Bulk and yet we imagine it appears of the same Size in both Situations because we know that on our Approach to it its Image would expand on the Senses and that the Difference consists not in the Object itself but in our Position with regard to it And indeed without such Correction of Appearances both in internal and external Sentiment Men could never think or talk steadily on any Subject while their fluctuating Situations produce a continual Variation on Objects  and throw them into such different and contrary Lights and Positions  For a like Reason the Tendencies of Actions and Characters not their real accidental Consequences are alone regarded in our moral Determinations or general Judgments tho' in our real Feeling or Sentiment we cannot help paying greater Regard to one whose Station join'd to Virtue renders him really useful to Society than to one who exerts the social Virtues only in good Intentions and benevolent Affections Separating the Character from the Fortune by an easy and necessary Effert of Thought we pronounce these Persons alike and give them the same general Praise The Judgment corrects or endeavours to correct the Appearance But is not able entirely to prevail over Sentiment  Why is this Peachtree said to be better than that other but because it produces more or better Fruit And would not the same Praise be given it tho' Snails or Vermin had destroy'd the Fruit before it came to full Maturity In Morals too is not  the Tree known by the Fruit  And cannot we easily distinguish betwixt Nature and Accident in the one Case as well as in the other    THE more we converse with Mankind and the greater social Entercourse we maintain the more will we be familiariz'd to these general Preferences and Distinctions without which our Conversation and Discourse could scarcely be render'd intelligible to each other Every Man's Interest is peculiar to himself and the Aversions and Desires which result from it cannot be suppos'd to affect others in a  like Degree General Language therefore being form'd for general Use must be moulded on some more general Views and must affix the Epithets of Praise or Blame in Conformity to Sentiments which arise from the general Interests of the Community And if these Sentiments in most Men be not so strong as those which have a Reference to private Good yet still they must make some Distinction even in Persons the most deprav'd and selfish and must attach the Notion of Good to a beneficent Conduct and of Evil to the contrary Sympathy we shall allow is much fainter than our Concern for Ourselves and Sympathy with Persons remote from us much sainter than that with Persons near and contiguous but for this very Reason 'tis necessary for us in our calm Judgments and Discourse concerning the Characters of Men to neglect all these Differences and render our Sentiments more public and social Besides that we Ourselves often change our Situation in this Particular we every Day meet with Persons who are in a different Situation from us and who could never converse with us on any reasonable Terms were we to remain constantly in that Position and Point of View which is peculiar to Ourself The Entercourse of Sentiments therefore in Society and Conversation makes us form some general inalterable Standard by which we may approve or disapprove of Characters  and Manners And tho' the Heart takes not part entirely with those general Notions nor regulates all its Love and Hatred by the universal abstract Differences of Vice and Virtue without regard to Self or the Persons with whom we are more immediately connected yet have these moral Differences a considerable Influence and being sufficient at least for Discourse serve all our Purposes in Company in the Pulpit on the Theatre and in the Schools  'Tis wisely ordain'd by Nature that private Connexions sh  uld commonly prevail over unversal Views and Considerations otherwise our Affections and Actions would be dissipared and l  st for Want of a proper limited Object Thus a small Benefit d  ne to Ourselves or our near Friends excites more lively Sentiments of Love and Approbation than a great Benefit to a distant Commonwealth But still we know here as in all the Senses to correct these Inequalities by Reflection and retain a general Standard of Vice and Virtue founded chiefly on general Usefulness    THUS in whatever Light we take this Subject the Merit ascrib'd to the social Virtues appears still uniform and arises chiefly from that Regard which the natural Sentiment of Benevolence engages us to pay to the Interests of Mankind and Society If we consider the Principles of the human Make such as they appear to daily Experience and Observation  we must  a priori  conclude it impossible for such a Creature as Man to be totally indifferent to the Well or Illbeing of his Fellowcreatures and not readily of himself to pronounce where nothing gives him any particular Byass that what promotes their Happiness is good what tends to their Misery is evil without any farther Regard or Consideration Here then are the faint Rudiments at least or Outlines of a  general  Distinction betwixt Actions and in Proportion as the Humanity of the Person is suppos'd to encrease his Connexion to those injur'd or benefited and his lively Conception of their Misery or Happiness his consequent Censure or Approbation acquires proportionable Force and Vigour There is no Necessity that a generous Action barely mention'd in an old History or remote Gazette should communicate any strong Feelings of Applause and Admiration Virtue plac'd at such a Distance is like a fixt Star which tho' to the Eye of Reason it may appear as luminous as the Sun in his Meridian is so infinitely remov'd as to affect the Senses neither with Light nor Heat Bring this Virtue nearer by our Acquaintance or Connexion with the Persons or even by an eloquent Narration and Recital of the Case our Hearts are immediately caught our Sympathy enliven'd and our cool Approbation converted into the warmest Sentiments of Friendship and Regard These seem necessary and  infallible Consequences of the general Principles of human Nature as discover'd in common Life and Practice  AGAIN reverse these Views and Reasonings Consider the Matter  a posteriori  and weighing the Consequences enquire if the Merit of all social Virtue is not deriv'd from the Feelings of Humanity with which it affects the Spectators It appears to be Matter of Fact that the Circumstance of  Utility  in all Subjects is a Source of Praise and Approbation That it is constantly appeal'd to in all moral Decisions concerning the Merit and Demerit of Actions That it is the  sole  Source of that high Regard paid to Justice Fidelity Honour Allegiance and Chastity That it is inseperable from all the other social Virtues of Humanity Generosity Charity Affability Lenity Mercy and Moderation And in a Word that it is the Foundation of the chief Part of Morals which has a Reference to Mankind and Society  IT appears also in our general Approbation or Judgment of Characters and Manners that the useful Tendency of the social Virtues moves us not by any Regards to Selfinterest but has an Influence much more universal and extensive It appears that a Tendency to public Good and to the promoting  of Peace Harmony and Concord in Society by affecting the benevolent Principles of our Frame engages us on the Side of the social Virtues And it appears as an additional Confirmation that these Principles of Humanity and Sympathy enter so deep into all our Sentiments and have so powerful an Influence as may enable them to excite the strongest Censure and Applause The present Theory is the simple Result of all these Inferences each of which seems founded on uniform Experience and Observation  WERE it doubtful whether there was any such Principle in our Nature as Humanity or a Concern for others yet when we see in numberless Instances that whatever has a Tendency to promote the Interests of Society is so highly approv'd of we ought thence to learn the Force of the benevolent Principle since 'tis impossible for any Thing to please as Means to an End where the End itself is totally indifferent On the other Hand were it doubtful whether there was implanted in our Natures any general Principle of moral Blame and Approbation yet when we see in numberless Instances the Influence of Humanity we ought thence to conclude that 'tis impossible but that every Thing which promotes the Interests of Society must communicate Pleasure and what is pernicious give Uneasiness But when  these different Reflections and Observations concur in establishing the same Conclusion must they not bestow an undisputed Evidence upon it  'Tis however hop'd that the Progress of this Argument will bring a farther Confirmation of the present Theory by showing the Rise of other Sentiments of Esteem and Regard from the same or like Principles  SECTION VI  Of QUALITIES useful to Ourselves  PART I  NOTHING is more usual than for Philosophers to encroach upon the Province of Grammarians and to engage in Disputes of Words while they imagine that they are handling Controversies of the deepest Importance and Concern Thus were we here to assert or to deny  that all laudable Qualities of the Mind were to be consider'd as Virtues or moral Attributes  many would imagine that we had enter'd upon one of the profoundest Speculations of Ethics tho' 'tis probable all the while that the greatest Part of the Dispute would be found entirely verbal To avoid therefore all frivolous Subtilties and Altercations as much as possible we shall content Ourselves with observing  first  that in common Life the Sentiments of Censure or Approbation produc'd by mental Qualities of every Kind are  very similar and  secondly  that all antient Moralists the best Models in treating of them make little or no Difference amongst them  FIRST  It seems certain that the  Sentiment  of conscious Worth the Selfsatisfaction proceeding from a Review of a Man's own Conduct and Character it seems certain I say that this Sentiment which tho' the most common of all others has no proper Name in our Language  The Term Pride is commenly taken in a bad Sense but this Sentiment seems indifferent and may be either good or bad according as it is well or ill founded and according to the other Circumstances that accompany it The  French  express this Sentiment by the Term  amour propre  but as they also express Selflove as well as Vanity by the same Term there arises thence a great Confusion in  Rocbefoucault  and many of their moral Writers  arises from the Endowments of Courage and Capacity Industry and Ingenuity as well as from any other mental Excellencies Who on the other Hand is not deeply mortify'd with reflecting on his own Folly or Dissoluteness and feels not a secret Sting or Compunction whenever his Memory presents any past Occurence where he behav'd with Stupidity or Illmanners No Time can efface the cruel Ideas of a Man's own Illconduct or of Affronts which Cowardice or Impudence have brought upon him They still  haunt his solitary Hours damp his most aspiring Thoughts and show him even to himself in the most contemptible and most odious Colours imaginable  WHAT is there too we are more anxious to conceal from others than such Blunders Infirmities and Meannesses or more dread to have expos'd by Raillery and Satyre And is not the chief Object of Vanity our Bravery or Learning our Wit or Breeding our Eloquence or Address our Taste or Ability These we display with Care if not with Ostentation and commonly show more Ambition of excelling in them than even in the social Virtues themselves which are in Reality of such superior Excellence Goodnature and Honesty especially the latter are so indispensibly requir'd that tho' the greatest Censure attends any Violation of these Duties no eminent Praise follows such common Instances of them as seem essential to the Support of human Society And hence the Reason in my Opinion why tho' Men often praise so liberally the Qualities of their Heart they are shy of commending the Endowments of their Head because the latter Virtues being suppos'd more rare and extraordinary are observ'd to be the more usual Objects of Pride and Selfconceit and when boasted of beget a strong Suspicion of these Sentiments  'Tis hard to tell whether you hurt a Man's Character most by calling him a Knave or a Coward and whether a beasily Glutton or Drunkard be not as odious and contemptible as a selfish ungenerous Miser Give me my Choice and I would rather for my own Happiness and Selfenjoyment have a friendly humane Heart than possess all the other Virtues of  Demosthenes  and  Philip  united But I would rather pass with the World for one endow'd with extensive Genius and intrepid Courage and should thence expect stronger Instances of general Applause and Admiration The Figure a Man makes in Life the Reception he meets with in Company the Esteem paid him by his Acquaintance all these Advantages depend as much upon his good Sense and Judgment as upon any other Part of his Character Had a Man the best Intentions in the World and were the farthest remov'd from all Injustice and Violence he would never be able to make himself be much regarded without a moderate Share at least of Parts and Understanding  WHAT is it then we can here dispute about If Sense and Courage Temperance and Industry Wit and Knowledge confessedly form a considerable Part of  personal Merit  if a Man possest of them is both better satisfy'd with himself and better entitled  to the Goodwill Esteem and Services of others than one entirely devoid of them if in short the  Sentiments  be similar that arise from these Endowments and from the social Virtues is there any Reason for being so extremely scrupulous about a  Word  or doubting whether they are entitled to the Denomination of Virtue  It seems to me that in our Language Courage Temperance Industry Frugality  c  according to popular Stile are call'd  Virtues  but when a Man is said to be  virtuous  or is denominated a Man of Virtue we chiefly regard his social Qualities 'Tis needless for a moral philosophical Discourse to enter into all these Caprices of Language which are so variable in different Dialects and in different Ages of the same Dialect The  Sentiments  of Men being more uniform as well as more important are a fitter Subject of Speculation Tho' at the same Time we may just observe that wherever the social Virtues are talk'd of 'tis plainly imploy'd by this Distinction that there are also other Virtues of a different Nature  It may indeed be pretended that the Sentiment of Approbation which those Accomplishments produce besides its being  inferior  is also somewhat  different  from that which attends the Virtues of Justice and Humanity But this seems not a sufficient Reason for ranking them entirely under different Classes and Appellations The Character of  Caesar  and that of  Cato  as drawn by  Salust  are both of them virtuous in the strictest Sense of the Word but in a different Way Nor are the Sentiments entirely the same which arise from them The one produces Love the other  Esteem The one is amiable the other awful We could wish to meet the one Character in a Friend the other we should be ambitious of in Ourselves In like Manner the Approbation which attends natural Abilities or Temperance or Industry may be somewhat different from that which is paid to the social Virtues without making them entirely of a different Species And indeed we may observe that the natural Abilities no more than the other Virtues produce not all of them the same Kind of Approbation Good Sense and Genius beget Esteem and Regard Wit and Humour excite Love and Affection  Love and Esteem are nearly the same Passion and arise from similar Causes The Qualities which produce both are such as communicate Pleasure But where this Pleasure is severe and serious or where its Object is great and makes a strong Impression or where it produces any Degree of Humility and Awe In all these Cases the Passion which arises from the Pleasure is more properly denominated Esteem than Love Benevolence attends both But is connected with Love in a more eminent Degree There seems to be still a stronger Mixture of Pride in Contempt than of Humility in Esteem and the Reason would not be difficult to one who study'd accurately the Passions All these various Mixtures and Compositions and Appearances of Sentiment form a very curious Subject of Speculation but are wide of our present Purpose Thro'out these Essays we always consider in general what Qualities are a Subject of Praise or of Censure without entering into all the minute Differences of Sentiment which they excite 'Tis evident that whatever is contemn'd is also dislik'd as well as what is hated and we here endeavour to take Objects according to their most simple Views and Appearances These Sciences are but too apt to appear abstract to common Readers even with all the Precautions we can take to clear them from superfluous Speculations and bring them down to every Capacity    MOST People I believe will naturally without Premeditation assent to the Definition of the elegant and judicious Poet  Virtue for mere Goodnature is a Fool  Is Sense and Spirit with Humanity  The Art of preserving Health Book    WHAT Pretensions has a Man to our generous Assistance or Goodoffices who has dissipated his Wealth in profuse Expences idle Vanities chimerical Projects dissolute Pleasures or extravagant Gaming These Vices for we scruple not to call them such bring Misery unpity'd and Contempt on every one addicted to them  ACHAEUS  a wise and prudent Prince fell into a fatal Snare which cost him his Crown and Life after having us'd every reasonable Precaution to guard himself against it On that Account says the Historian he is a just Object of Regard and Compassion His Betrayers alone of Hatred and Contempt  Polybius Lib Cap    THE precipitate Flight and improvident Negligence of  Pompey  at the Beginning of the civil Wars appear'd such notorious Blunders to  Cicero  as quite pall'd his Friendship towards that great Man  In the same Manner  says he  as Want of Cleanliness Decency or Discretion in a Mistress are found to alienate our Affections  For so he expresses himself where he talks not in the Character of a Philosopher but in that of a Statesman and Man of the World to his Friend  Atticus  Lib Epist    BUT  secondly  the same  Cicero  in Imitation of all the antient Moralists when he reasons as a Philosopher enlarges very much his Ideas of Virtue and comprehends every laudable Quality or Endowment of the Mind under that honourable Appellation The  Prudence  explain'd in his  Offices  Lib Cap  is that Sagacity which leads to the Discovery of Truth and preserves us from Error and Mistake  Magnanimity Temperance Decency  are there also at large discours'd of And as that eloquent Moralist follow'd the common receiv'd Division of the four cardinal Virtues our social Duties form but one Head in the general Distribution of his Subject  WE need only peruse the Titles of Chapters in  Aristotle's  Ethics to be convinc'd that he ranks Courage Temperance Magnificence Magnanimity Modesty Prudence and a manly Freedom amongst the Virtues as well as Justice and Friendship  To  sustain  and to  abstain  that is to be patient and continent appear'd to some of the Antients a summary Comprehension of all Morals  EPICTETUS  has scarce ever mentioned the Sentiment of Humanity and Compassion but in order to put his Disciples on their Guard against it The Virtue of the  Stoics  seems to consist chiefly in a firm Temper and a sound Understanding With them as with  Solomon  and the Eastern Moralists Folly and Wisdom are equivalent to Vice and Virtue  MEN will praise thee says  David  Psalm th  when thou dost well unto thyself I hate a wise Man says the  Greek  Poet who is not wise to himself  Incert apud Lucianum Apologia pro mercede conductis    PLUTARCH  is no more crampt by Systems in his Philosophy than in his History Where he compares the great Men of  Greece  and  Rome  he fairly  sets in Opposition all their Blemishes and Accomplishments of whatever Kind and omits nothing considerable that can either depress or exalt their Characters His moral Discourses contain the same free and natural Censure of Men and Manners  THE Character of  Hannibal  as drawn by  Livy  Lib Cap  is esteem'd partial but allows him many eminent Virtues Never was there a Genius says the Historian more equally sitted for those opposite Offices of Command and Obedience and 'twere therefore difficult to determine whether he render'd himself  dearer  to the General or to the Army To none would  Hasdrubal  entrust more willingly the Conduct of any dangerous Enterprize under none did the Soldiers discover more Courage and Confidence Great Boldness in affronting Danger great Prudence in the Midst of it No Labour could fatigue his Body or subdue his Mind Cold and Heat were indifferent to him Meat and Drink he sought as Supplies to the Necessities of Nature not as Gratifications of his voluptuous Appetites Waking or Rest he us'd indiscriminately by Night or by DayThese great VIRTUES were ballanc'd by great VICES Inhuman Cruelty Perfidy more than  Punic  no Truth no Faith no Regard to Oaths Promises or Religion  THE Character of  Alexander  the Sixth to be found in  Guicciardin  Lib  is pretty similar but juster and is a Proof that even the Moderns where they speak naturally hold the same Language with the Antients In this Pope says he there was a singular Capacity and Judgment Admirable Prudence a wonderful Talent of Persuasion and in all momentuous Enterprizes a Diligence and Dexterity incredible But these  Virtues  were infinitely overballanc'd by his  Vices  no Faith no Religion insatiable Avarice exorbitant Ambition and a more than barbarous Cruelty  POLYBIUS  Lib  reprehending  Timaeus  for his Partiality against  Agathocles  whom he himself allows to be the most cruel and impious of all Tyrants says If he took Refuge in  Syracuse  as asserted by that Historian flying the Dirt and Smoke and Toil of his former Profession of a Potter and if proceeding from such slender Beginnings he became Master in a little Time of all  Sicily  brought the  Carthaginian  State into the utmost Danger and at last dy'd in Oldage and in Possession of kingly Dignity Must he not be allow'd something prodigious and extraordinary and to have possest great Talents and Capacity for Business and Action  His Historian therefore ought not to have alone related what tended to his Reproach and Infamy but also what might redound to his PRAISE and HONOUR  IN general we may observe that the Distinction of voluntary or involuntary was little regarded by the Antients in their moral Reasonings where they frequently treated the Question as very doubtful  whether Virtue could be taught or not  Vid  Plato in Menone Seneca de otio sap  Cap So also  Horace Virtutem doctrina paret naturane donet  Epist Lib Ep  They justly consider'd that Cowardice Meanness Levity Anxiety Impatience Folly and many other Qualities of the Mind might appear ridiculous and deform'd contemptible and odious tho' independant of the Will Nor could it be suppos'd at all Times in every Man's Power to attain every Kind of mental more than exterior Beauty  BUT modern Philosophers treating all Morals as on a like Footing with civil Laws guarded by the Sanctions of Reward and Punishment were necessarily led to render this Circumstance of  voluntary  or  involuntary  the Foundation of their whole Theory Every one may employ  Terms  in what Sense he pleases But this in the mean Time must  be allow'd that  Sentiments  are every Day experienc'd of Blame and Praise which have Objects beyond the Dominion of the Will or Choice and of which it behoves us if not as Moralists as speculative Philosophers at least to give some satisfactory Theory and Explication  A BLEMISH a Fault a Vice a Crime these Expressions seem to denote different Degrees of Censure and Disapprobation which are however all of them at the Bottom pretty nearly the same Kind of Species The Explication of one will lead us easily into a just Conception of the others  PART II  IT seems evident that where a Quality or Habit is subjected to our Examination if it appear in any respect prejudicial to the Person possest of it or such as incapacitates him for Business and Action it is instantly blam'd and rank'd amongst his Faults and Imperfections Indolence Negligence Want of Order and Method Obstinacy Fickleness Rashness Credulity no one ever esteem'd these Qualities indifferent to a Character much less extoll'd them as Accomplishments or Virtues The Prejudice resulting from them immediately strikes our  Eye and gives us the Sentiment of Pain and Disapprobation  No Qualiity 'tis allow'd is absolutely either blameable or praiseworthy 'Tis all according to its Degrees A due Medium say the  Peripatetics  is the Characteristic of Virtue But this Medium is chiefly determin'd by Utility A proper Celerity for Instance and Dispatch in Business is commendable When defective no Progress is ever made in the Execution of any Purpose When excessive it engages us in precipitate and illconcerted Measures and Enterprizes By such Reasonings as these we fix the proper and commendable Mediocrity in all moral and prudential Disquisitions and never lose View of the Advantages which result from any Character or Habit  Now as these Advantages are enjoy'd by the Person possest of the Character it can never be  Selflove  which renders the Prospect of them agreeable to us the Spectators and prompts our Esteem and Approbation No Force of Imagination can convert us into another Person and make us fancy that we being that Person reap Benefit from those valuable Qualities which belong to him Or if it did no Celerity of Imagination could immediately transport us back into ourselves and make us love and esteem the Person as different from us Views  and Sentiments so opposite to known Truth and to each other could never have place at the same Time in the same Person All Suspicion therefore of selfish Regards are here totally excluded 'Tis a quite different Principle which actuates our Bosom and interests us in the Felicity of the Person we contemplate Where his natural Talents and acquir'd Abilities give us the Prospect of Elevation Advancement a Figure in Life prosperous Success a steady Command over Fortune and the Execution of great or advantageous Undertakings we are struck with such agreeable Images and feel a Complacency and Regard immediately arise towards him The Ideas of Happiness Joy Triumph Prosperity are connected with every Circumstance of his Character and diffuse over our Minds a pleasing Sentiment of Sympathy and Humanity  One may venture to affirm that there is no human Creature to whom the Appearance of Happiness where Envy or Revenge has no Place does not give Pleasure that of Misery Uneasiness This seems inseperable from our Make and Constitution But they are only the more generous Minds that are thence prompted to seek zealously the Good of others and to have a real Passion for their Welfare With Men of narrow and ungenerous Spirits this Sympathy goes not beyond a slight Feeling of the Imagination which serves only to excite Sentiments of Complacency or Censure and make them apply to the Object either honourable or dishonourable Appellations A griping Miser for Instance praises extremely  Industry  and  Frugality  even in others and sets them in his Estimation above all the other Virtues He knows the Good that results from them and feels that Species of Happiness with a more lively Sympathy than any other you could represent to him tho' perhaps he would not part with a Shilling to make the Fortune of the industrious Man whom he praises so highly    LET us suppose a Person originally so fram'd as to have no Manner of Concern for his Fellow creatures but to regard the Happiness and Misery of all sensible Beings with greater Indifference even than two contiguous Shades of the same Colour Let us suppose if the Prosperity of Nations were lay'd on the one hand and their Ruin on the other and he were desir'd to choose that he would stand like the Schoolman's Ass irresolute and undetermin'd betwixt equal Motives or rather like the same Ass betwixt two Pieces of Wood or Marble without any Inclination or Propensity on either Side The Consequence I believe must be allow'd just that such a Person being absolutely unconcern'd either as to the public Good of a Community or the private Utility of others would look on every Quality however pernicious or however beneficial to Society or to its Possessor with the same Indifference as on the most common and uninteresting Object  BUT if instead of this fancy'd Monster we suppose a  Man  to form a Judgment or Determination in  the Case there is to him a plain Foundation of Preference where every Thing else is equal and however cool his Choice may be if his Heart be selfish or if the Persons interested be remote from him there must still be a Choice and a Distinction betwixt what is useful and what is pernicious Now this Distinction is the same in all its Parts with the  moral Distinction  whose Foundation has been so osten and so much in vain enquir'd after The same Endowments of the Mind in every Circumstance are agreeable to the Sentiment of Morals and to that of Humanity the same Temper is susceptible of high Degrees of the one Sentiment and of the other and the same Alteration in the Objects by their nearer Approach or by Connexions enlivens the one and the other By all the Rules of Philosophy therefore we must conclude that these Sentiments are originally the same since in each particular even the most minute they are govern'd by the same Laws and are mov'd by the same Objects  WHY do Philosophers infer with the greatest Certainty that the Moon is kept in its Orbit by the same Force of Gravity which makes Bodies fall near the Surface of the Earth but because these Effects are upon Computation found similar and equal And must not this Argument bring equal Conviction in moral as in natural Disquisitions  To prove by any long Detail that all the Qualities useful to the Possessor are approv'd and the contrary censur'd would be superfluous The least Reflection on what is every Day experienc'd in Life will be sufficient We shall only mention a few Instances in order to remove if possible all Doubt and Hesitation  THE Quality the most necessary for the Execution of any useful Enterprize is DISCRETION by which we carry on a safe Intercourse with others give due Attention to our own and to their Character weigh each Circumstance of the Business we undertake and employ the surest and safest Means for the Attainment of any End or Purpose To a  Cromwell  perhaps or a  De Retz  Discretion may appear an Aldermanlike Virtue as Dr  Swift  calls it and being incompatible with those vast Designs to which their Courage and Ambition prompted them it might really in them be a Fault or Imperfection But in the Conduct of ordinary Life no Virtue is more requisite not only to obtain Success but to avoid the most fatal Miscarriages and Disappointments The greatest Parts without it as observ'd by an elegant Writer may be fatal to their Owner as  Polyphemus  depriv'd of his Eye was only the more expos'd  on Account of his enormous Strength and Stature  THE best Character indeed were it not rather too perfect for human Nature is that which gives nothing to Temper of any Kind but alternately employs Enterprize and Caution as each is  useful  to the particular Purpose intended Such is the Excellence which St  Evremond  ascribes to Mareschal  Turenne  who display'd every Campaign as he grew older more Temerity in his military Enterprizes and being now from long Experience perfectly acquainted with every Incident in War he advanc'd with greater Firmness and Boldness in a Road so well known to him  Fabius  says  Machiavel  was cautious  Scipio  enterprizing And both succeeded because the Situation of the  Roman  Affars during the Command of each was peculiarly adapted to his Genius but both would have fail'd had these Situations been inverted He is happy whose Circumstances suit his Temper but he is more excellent who can suit his Temper to any Circumstances  WHAT need is there to display the Praises of INDUSTRY and to extol its Advantages in the Acquisition of Power and Riches or in raising what we call a  Fortune  in the World The Tortoise according to the Fable by his Assiduity gain'd the  Race of the Hare tho' possest of much superior Swiftness A Man's Time when well husbanded is like a cultivated Field of which a few Acres produce more of what is useful to Life than extensive Provinces even of the richest Soil when overrun with Weeds and Brambles  BUT all Prospect of Success in Life or even of tolerable Subsistence must fail where a reasonable FRUGALITY is wanting The Heap instead of encreasing diminishes daily and leaves its Possessor so much more unhappy that not having been able to confine his Expences to a larger Revenue he will still less be able to live contentedly on a smaller The Souls of Men according to  Plato  Phaedo  inflam'd with impure Appetites and losing the Body which alone afforded Means of Satisfaction hover about the Earth and haunt the Places where their Bodies are reposited possest with a longing Desire to recover the lost Organs of Sensation So may we see worthless Prodigals having consum'd their Fortunes in wild Debauches thrusting themselves into every plentiful Table and every Party of Pleasure hated even by the vicious and despis'd even by Fools  THE one Extreme of Frugality is  Avarice  which as it both deprives a Man of all Use of his Riches and checks Hospitality and every social Enjoyment is justly censur'd on a double Account  Prodigality  the other Extreme is commonly more hurtful to a Man himself and each of these Extremes is blam'd above the other according to the Temper of the Person who censures and according to his greater or less Sensibility to Pleasure either social or sensual  ALL Men 'tis allow'd are equally desirous of Happiness but all Men are not equally successful in the Pursuit Of which one chief Cause is the common Want of STRENGTH of MIND which might enable us to resist the Temptation of present Ease or Pleasure and carry us forward in the Search of more distant Profit and Enjoyment Our Affections on a general Prospect of their Objects form certain Rules of Conduct and certain Measures of Preference of one above another And these Decisions tho' really the Result of our calm Passions and Propensities for what else can pronounce any Object eligible or the contrary are yet said by a natural Abuse of Terms to be the Determinations of pure  Reason  and Reflection But when some of these Objects approach nearer us or acquire the Advantages of favourable Lights and Positions which  catch the Heart or Imagination our general Resolutions are frequently confounded a small Enjoyment preferr'd and lasting Shame and Sorrow entail'd upon us And however Poets may employ their Wit and Eloquence in celebrating present Pleasure and rejecting all distant Views to Fame Health or Fortune 'tis obvious that this Practice is the Source of all Dissoluteness and Debauchery Repentance and Misery A Man of a strong and determin'd Temper adheres tenaciously to his general Resolutions and is neither seduc'd by the Allurements of Pleasure nor terrify'd by the Menaces of Pain but keeps still in View those distant Pursuits by which he at once ensures his Happiness and his Honour  SELFSATISFACTION at least in some Degree is an Advantage that equally attends the FOOL and the WISEMAN But 'tis the only one nor is there any other Circumstance in the Conduct of Life where they are upon an equal Footing Business Books Conversation for all of these a Fool is totally incapacitated and except condemn'd by his Station to the coarsest Drudgery remains a  useless  Burthen upon the Earth Accordingly 'tis found that Men are infinitely jealous of their Character in this Particular and many Instances are seen of Profligacy and Treachery the most avow'd  and unreserved none of bearing patiently the Imputation of Ignorance and Stupidity  Dicaearchus  the  Macedonian  General who as  Polybius  Lib Cap  tells us openly erected one Altar to Impiety and another to Injustice in order to bid Defiance to Mankind even he I am well assur'd would have started at the Epithet of  Fool  and have meditated Revenge for so injurious an Appellation Except the Affection of Parents the strongest and most indissoluble Bond in Nature no Connexion has Strength sufficient to support the Disgust arising from this Character Love itself which can subsist under Treachery Ingratitude Malice and Infidelity is immediately extinguish'd by it when perceiv'd and acknowledg'd nor are Deformity and Oldage more fatal to the Dominion of that Passion So dreadful are the Ideas of an utter Incapacity for any Purpose or Undertaking and of continu'd Error and Misconduct in Life  WHEN 'tis ask'd whether a quick or a slow Apprehension be most valuable Whether one that at first View penetrates far into a Subject but can perform nothing upon Study or a contrary Character which must work out every Thing by Dint of Application Whether a clear Head or a copious  Invention Whether a profound Genius or a sure Judgment In short what Character or peculiar Turn of Understanding is more excellent than another 'Tis evident we can answer none of these Questions without considering which of those Qualities capacitates a Man best for the World and carries him faithest in any of his Undertakings  IF refin'd Sense and exalted Sense be not so  useful  as common Sense their Rarity their Novelty and the Nobleness of their Objects make some Compensation and render them the Admiration of Mankind As Gold tho' less serviceable than Iron acquires from its Scarcity a Value which is much superior  THE Desects of Judgment can be supply'd by no Art or Invention but those of MEMORY frequently may both in Business and in Study by Method and Industry and by Diligence in committing every Thing to Paper and we scarce ever hear a short Memory given as a Reason for a Man's Want of Success in any Undertaking But in antient Times when no Man could make a Figure without the Talent of speaking and when the Audience were too delicate to bear such crude undigested Harangues as our extemporary Orators offer to public Assemblies the Faculty of Memory was then of  the utmost Consequence and was accordingly much more valued than at present Scarce any great Genius is mention'd in Antiquity who is not celebrated for this Talent and  Cicero  enumerates it amongst the other sublime Qualities of  Caesar  himself  Fuit in illo ingenium ratio memoria literae cura cogitatio diligentia  c  Phillip    PARTICULAR Customs and Manners alter the Usefulness of Qualities they also alter their Merit Particular Situations and Accidents have in some Degree the same Influence He will always be more esteem'd who professes those Talents and Accomplishments which suit his Station and Profession than the whom Fortune has misplac'd in the Part she has assign'd him The private or selfish Virtues are in this respect more arbitrary than the public and social In other respects they are perhaps less liable to Doubt and Controversy  IN this Kingdom such continu'd Ostentation of late Years has been display'd among Men in  active  Life with regard to  public Spirit  and among those in  speculative  with regard to  Benevolence  and so many false Pretensions to each have been no doubt detected that Men of the World are apt without  any bad Intention to discover a sullen Incredulity on the head of these moral Endowments and even sometimes absolutely to deny their Existence and Reality In like Manner I find that of old the perpetual Cant of the  Stoics  and  Cynics  concerning  Virtue  their magnificent Professions and slender Performances bred a Disgust in Mankind and  Lucian  who tho' licentious on the Article of Pleasure is yet in other respects a very moral Writer cannot sometimes talk of Virtue so much boasted without betraying Symptoms of Spleen and Irony  Luc Timon Again  Icuromen In another Place  Deor Concil  But surely this peevish Delicacy whenceever it arises can never be carry'd so far as to make us deny the Existence of every Species of Virtue and all Distinction of Manners and Behaviour Besides  Discretion Caution Enterprize Industry Assiduity Fragality OEconomy Goodsense Prudence Discernment  besides these Virtues I say whose very Names force an Avowal of their Merit there are many others to which the most determin'd Sceptism cannot for a Moment refuse the Tribute of Praise and Approbation  Temperance Sobriety Patience Constancy  Perseverance Forethought Considerateness Secrecy Order Insinuation Address Presence of Mind Quickness of Conception Facility of Expression  these and a thousand more of the same Kind no Man will ever deny to be Excellencies and Endowments As their Merit consists in their Tendency to serve the Person possest of them without any magnificent Claims of public and social Desert we are the less jealous of their Pretensions and readily admit them into the Catalogue of Virtues We are not sensible that by this Concession we have pav'd the Way for all the other moral Excellencies and cannot consistently hesitate any longer with regard to disinterested Benevolence Patriotism and Humanity  IT seems indeed certain that first Appearances are here as usual extremely deceitful and that 'tis more difficult in a speculative Way to resolve into Selflove the Merit we ascribe to the selfish Virtues abovemention'd than that even of the social Virtues of Justice and Beneficence For this latter Purpose we need but say that whatever Conduct and Behaviour promotes the Good of the Community is lov'd prais'd and esteem'd by the Community on Account of that Utility and Interest of which every one partakes And tho' this Affection and Regard be in Reality Gratitude not Selflove yet a Distinction even of this obvious Nature may not  readily be made by superficial Reasoners and there is Room at least to support the Cavil and Dispute for a Moment But as Qualities which tend only to the Utility of their Possessor without any Reference to us or to the Community are yet esteem'd and valu'd by what Theory or System can we account for this Sentiment from Selflove or deduce it from that favourite Origin There seems here a Necessity of confessing that the Happiness and Misery of others are not Spectacles altogether indifferent to us but that the View of the former whether in its Causes or Effects like Sunshine or the Prospect of wellcultivated Plains to carry our Pretensions no higher communicates a secret Joy and Satisfaction the Appearance of the latter like a lowering Cloud or barren Landskip throws a melancholy Damp over the Imagination And this Concession being once made the Difficulty is over and a natural unforc'd Interpretation of the Phaenomena of human Life will afterwards we may hope prevail amongst all speculative Enquirers  PART III  IT may not be improper in this Place to examine the Influence of bodily Endowments and of the Goods of Fortune over our Sentiments of Regard and Esteem and to consider whether these Phaenomena strengthen or weaken the present Theory  'TIS evident that one considerable Source of  Beauty  in all Animals is the Advantage they reap from the particular Fabric or Structure of their Limbs and Members suitable to the particular Manner of Life to which they are by Nature destin'd The just Proportions of a Horse describ'd by  Xenophon  and  Virgil  are the same which are receiv'd at this Day by our modern Jockeys because the Foundation of them is the same  viz  Experience of what is detrimental or useful in the Animal  BROAD Shoulders a lank Belly firm Joints taper Legs all these are beautiful in our Species because Signs of Force and Vigour Ideas of Utility and its contrary tho' they do not altogether determine what is handsome or deform'd are evidently  the Source of a considerable Part of Approbation or Dislike  IN ancient Times bodily Strength and Dexterity being of greater  Use  and Importance in War was also much more esteem'd and valu'd than at present Not to insist on  Homer  and the Poets we may observe that Historians scruple not to mention  Force of Body  among the other Accomplishments even of  Epaminondas  whom they acknowledge to be the greatest Hero Statesman and General of all the  Greeks  Diodorus Siculue Lib It may not be improper to give the Character of  Epaminondas  as drawn by the Historian in order to show the Ideas of perfect Merit which prevailed in those Ages In other illustrious Men says he you will observe that each possest some one shining Quality which was the Foundation of his Fame In  Epaminondas  all the  Virtues  are found united Force of Body Eloquence of Expression Vigour of Mind Contempt of Riches Gentleness of Disposition and  what is chiefly to be regarded  Courage and Conduct in War  A like Praise is given to  Pompey  one of the greatest of the  Romans  Cum alacribus saltu cum velocibus cursu cum validis recte certabat  Sallust apud Veget  This Instance is fimilar to what we observ'd above with regard to Memory  WHAT Derision and Contempt with both Sexes attend  Impotence  while the unhappy Object is regarded  as one depriv'd of so capital a Pleasure in Life and at the same Time as disabled from communicating it to others  Barrenness  in Women being also a Species of  Inutility  is a Reproach but not in the same Degree Of which the Reason is very obvious according to the present Theory  To the same Purpose we may observe a Phaenomenon which might appear somewhat trivial and ludicrous if any Thing could be trivial which fortify'd Conclusions of such Importance or ludicrous which was employ'd in a philosophical Reasoning 'Tis a general Remark that those we call good  Women's Men  who have either signaliz'd themselves by their amorous Exploits or whose Make of Body or other Symptoms promise any extraordinary Vigour of that Kind are well receiv'd by the fair Sex and naturally engage the Affections even of those whose Virtue or Situation prevents any Design of ever giving Employment to those Talents The Imagination is pleas'd with these Conceptions and entering with Satisfaction into the Ideas of so favourite an Enjoyment feels a Complacency and Goodwill towards the Person A like Principle operating more extensively is the general Source of moral Affection and Approbation    THERE is no Rule in Painting or Statuary more indispensible than that of ballancing the Figures and placing them with the greatest Exactness on their proper Center of Gravity A Figure which is not justly ballanc'd is ugly because it conveys the disagreeable Ideas of Fall Harm and Pain  All Men are equally liable to Pain and Disease and Sickness and may again recover Health and Ease These Circumstances as they make no Distinction betwixt one Man and another are no Source of Pride or Humility Regard or Contempt But comparing our own Species to superior ones 'tis a very mortifying Co  sideration that we should be so liable to all Diseases and Infirmities and Divines accordingly employ this Topic in order to depress Selfconceit and Vanity They would have more Success if the common Bent of our Thoughts were not perpetually turn'd to compare ourselves with each other The Infirmities of old Age are mortifying because a Comparison with the Young may take place The King's Evil is industriously conceal'd because it affects others and is transmitted to Posterity The Case is nearly the same with such Diseases as convey any nauseous or frightful Images the Epilepsy for Instance Ulcers Sores Scabs  c    A DISPOSITION or Turn of Mind which qualifies a Man to rise in the World and advance his Fortune is entitled to Esteem and Regard as has been already explain'd It may therefore naturally be suppos'd that the actual Possession of Riches and Authority will have a considerable Influence over these Sentiments  LET us examine any Hypothesis by which we can account for the Regard pay'd the Rich and Powerful We shall find none satisfactory but that which derives it from the Enjoyment communicated by the Images of Prosperity Happiness Ease Plenty Command and the Gratification of every Appetite Selflove for Instance which some affect so much to consider as the Source of every Sentiment is  plainly insufficient to this Purpose Where no Goodwill or Friendship appears 'tis difficult to conceive on what we can found our Hope of Advantage from the Riches of others tho' we naturally esteem and respect the Rich even before they discover any such favourable Disposition towards us  WE are affected with the same Sentiments when we lie so much out of the Sphere of their Activity that they cannot even be suppos'd to possess the Power of serving us A Prisoner of War in all civiliz'd Nations is treated with a Regard suited to his Condition and Riches 'tis evident go far towards fixing the Condition of any Person If Birth and Quality enter for a Share this still affords us an Argument to our present Purpose For what is it we call a Man of Birth but one who is descended from a long Succession of rich and powerful Ancestors and who acquires our Esteem by his Conn  ion with Persons whom we esteem His Ancestors therefore tho' dead are respected in some Measure on Account of their Riches and consequently without any Kind of Expectation  BUT not to go so far as Prisoners of War or the Dead to find Instances of this disinterested Regard for Riches we may only observe with a little Attention those Phaenomena that occur in common  Life and Conversation A Man who is himself we shall suppose of a competent Fortune and of no Profession coming into a Company of Strangers naturally treats them with different Degrees of Respect and Deference as he is inform'd of their different Fortunes and Conditions tho' 'tis impossible he can so suddenly propose and perhaps would not accept of any pecuniary Advantage from them A Traveller is always admitted into Company and meets with Civility in Proportion as his Train and Equipage speak him a Man of great or moderate Fortune In short the different Ranks of Man are in a great Measure regulated by Riches and that with regard to Superiors as well as Inferiors Strangers as well as Acquaintance  WHAT remains therefore but to conclude that as Riches are desir'd for ourself only as the Means of gratifying our Appetites either at present or in some imaginary future Period they beget Esteem in others merely from their having that Influence This indeed is their very Nature or Essence They have a direct Reference to the Commodities Conveniencies and Pleasures of Life A Banker's Bill who is broke or Gold in a desart Island would otherwise be full as valuable When we approach a Man who is as we say at his Ease we are presented with the pleasing Ideas of Plenty Satisfaction  Cleanliness Warmth a chearful House elegant Furniture ready Service and whatever is desirable in Meat Drink or Apparel On the contrary when a poor Man appears the disagreeable Images of Want Penury hard Labour dirty Furniture coarse or ragged Cloaths nauseous Meat and distasteful Liquor immediately strike our Fancy What else do we mean by saying the one is rich the other poor And as Regard or Contempt is the natural Consequence of these different Situations in Life 'tis easily seen what additional Light and Evidence this throws on our preceding Theory with Regard to all moral Distinctions  There is something very extraordinary and seemingly unaccountable in the Operation of our Passions when we consider the Fortune and Situation of others Very often another's Advancement and Prosperity produces Envy which has a strong Mixture of Hatred and arises chiefly from the Comparison of ourselves with the Person At the very same Time or at least in very short Intervals we may feel the Passion of Respect which is a Species of Affection or Goodwill with a Mixture of Humility On the other hand the Misfortunes of our Fellows often cause Pity which has a strong Mixture of Goodwill This Sentiment of Pity is nearly ally'd to Contempt which is a Species of Dislike along with a Mixture of Pride I only point out these Phaenomena as a Subject of Speculation to such as are curious with regard to moral Enquiries 'Tis sufficient for the present Purpose to observe in general that Power and Riches commonly cause Respect Poverty and Meanness Contempt tho' particular Views and Incidents may sometimes raise the Passions of Envy and of Pity    A MAN who has cur'd himself of all ridiculous Prepossessions and is fully sincerely and steddily convinc'd from Experience as well as Philosophy that the Differences of Fortune make less Difference in Happiness than is vulgarly imagin'd such a one measures not out Degrees of Esteem according to the Rentrolls of his Acquaintance He may indeed externally pay a superior Deference to the great Lord above the Vassal because Riches are the most convenient being the most fixt and determinate Source of Distinction But his internal Sentiments are more regulated by the personal Characters of Men than by the accidental and capricious Favours of Fortune  IN most Countries of  Europe  Family that is hereditary Riches mark'd with Titles and Symbols from the Sovereign is the chief Source of Distinction In  England  more Regard is paid to present Opulence and Plenty Each Practice has its Advantages and Disadvantages Where Birth is respected unactive spiritless Minds remain in haughty Indolence and dream of nothing but Pedigrees and Genealogies The generous and ambitious seek Honour and Command and Reputation and Favour Where Riches are the chief Idol Corruption Venality Rapine prevail Arts Manufactures Commerce  Agriculture flourish The former Prejudice being favourable to military Virtue is more suited to Monarchies The other being the chief Spur to Industry agrees better with a republican Government And we accordingly find that each of these Forms of Government by varying the  Utility  of those Customs has commonly a proportionable Effect on the Sentiments of Mankind  SECTION VII  Of QUALITIES immediately agreeable to Ourselves  WHOEVER has past an Evening with serious melancholy People and has observ'd how suddenly the Conversation was animated and what Sprightliness diffus'd itself over the Countenance Discourse and Behaviour of every one on the Accession of a goodhumour'd lively Companion such a one I say will easily allow that CHEERFULNESS carries great Merit with it and naturally conciliates the Affection and Goodwill of Mankind No Quality indeed more readily communicates itself to all around because none has a greater Propensity to display itself in jovial Talk and pleasant Entertainment The Flame spreads thro' the whole Circle and the most sullen and morose are often caught by it That the melancholy  hate the merry even tho'  Horace  says it I have some Difficulty to allow because I have always observ'd that where the Jollity is moderate and decent serious People are so much the more delighted that it dissipates the Gloom with which they are commonly opprest and gives them an unusual Satisfaction and Enjoyment  FROM this Influence of Cheerfulness both to communicate itself and to engage Approbation we may perceive that there are another Set of Virtues which without any Utility or any Tendency to farther Good either of the Community or of the Possessor diffuse a Satisfaction on the Beholders and conciliate Friendship and Regard Their immediate Sensation to the Person possest of them is agreeable Others enter into the same Humour and catch the Sentiment by a Contagion or natural Sympathy And as we cannot forbear loving whatever pleases a kindly Emotion arises towards the Person who communicates so much Delight and Satisfaction He is a more animating Spectacle His Presence diffuses over us more serene Complacency and Enjoyment Our Imagination entering into his Feelings and Disposition is affected in a more agreeable Manner than if a melancholy dejected sullen anxious Temper were presented to our Notice and Observation Hence the Affection  and Approbation which attends the former The Aversion and Disgust with which we regard the latter  There is no Man who on particular Occasions is not affected with all the disagreeable Passions Fear Anger Dejection Grief Melancholy Anxiety  c  But these so far as they are natural and universal make no Difference betwixt one Man and another and can never be the Object of Blame 'Tis only when the Disposition gives a  Propensity  to any of these disagreeable Passions that they disfigure the Character and by giving Uneasiness convey the Sentiment of Disapprobation to the Spectator    FEW Men would envy the Character which  Caesar  gives  Cassius  He loves no Play  As thou do'st  Anthony  He hears no Music  Seldom he smiles and smiles in such a Sort  As if he mockt himself and scorn'd his Spirit  That could be mov'd to smile at any thing  Not only such Men as  Caesar  adds are commonly  dangerous  but also having little Enjoyment within themselves they can never become agreeable to others or contribute any Thing to social Pleasure and Entertainment In all polite Nations and Ages a Relish of Pleasure if accompany'd with Temperance and Decency is esteem'd a considerable  Merit even in the greatest Men and becomes still more requisite in those of infe  ior Rank and Character 'Tis an agreeable Representation Which a  French  Writer gives of the Situation of his own Mind in this Particular  Virtue I love  says he  without Aisterity Pleasure without Effeminacy And Life without securing its End  J'aime la vertu sans rudessé  J'aime le plaisir sans molesse  J'aime la vie n'en crains point la fin  St  Evremond    WHO is not struck with any signal Instance of GREATNESS of MIND or Dignity of Character with Elevation of Sentiments Disdain of Slavery and with that noble Pride and Spirit which arises from conscious Worth and Virtue The Sublime says  Longinus  is often nothing but the Echo or Image of Magnanimity and where this Quality appears in any one even without uttering a Syllable it excites our Applause and Admiration as may be observ'd of the famous Silence of  Ajax  in the  Odyssey  which expresies more noble Disdain and resolute Indignation than any Language can convey  Cap    Were I  Alexander say'd  Parmenio I would accept of these Offers made by  Darius  So would I too  reply'd  Alexander were I  Parmenio This Saying is admirable says  Longinus  from a like Principle  Idem    GO  cries the same Hero to his Soldiers when they refus'd to follow him to the  Indies go tell your Countrymen you left  Alexander  compleating the Conquest of the World  "  Alexander  "  said the Prince of  Condé  who always admir'd the Passage  "abandon'd by his Soldiers amongst Barbarians not yet fully subdu'd felt in himself such a Dignity and Right of Empire that he could not believe it possible any one would refuse to obey him Whether in  Europe  or in  Asia  amongst  Greeks  or  Persians  all was indifferent to him Wherever he found Men he fancy'd he would find Subjects"  THE Confident of  Medea  in the Tragedy recommends Caution and Submission and enumerating all the Distresses of that unfortunate Heroine asks her what she has to support her against so many Enemies  Myself  replies she  Myself I say and it is enough Boilcau  justly recommends this Passage as an Instance of true Sublime  Reflection sur Longin    WHEN  Phocion  the modest the gentle  Phocion  was led to Execution he turn'd about to one of his Fellowsufferers who was lamenting his own hard  Fate  Is it not Glory enough for you  says he  that you die along with  Phocion  Plutarch in Phoc    PLACE in Opposition the Picture which  Tacitus  draws of  Vitellius  fallen from Empire prolonging his lgnominy from a wretched Love of Life deliver'd over to the merciless Rabble tost buffetted and kickt about and constrain'd by their holding a Poynard under his Chin to raise his Head and expose himself to every Contumely What abject Infamy What low Humiliation Yet even here says the Historian he discover'd some Symptoms of a Mind not altogether degenerate To a Tribune who insulted him he reply'd  I am still your Emperor  Tacit Hist Lib The Author entering upon the Narration says  Laniata veste faedum spectaculum ducebatur multis increpantibus nullo inlacrimante  deformitas exitus misericordiam abstulerat To enter thoroughly into this Method of thinking we must make Allowance for the antient Maxims that no one ought to prolong his Life after it became dishonourable but as he had always a Right to dispose of it it then became a Duty to part with it    WE never excuse the absolute Want of Spirit and Dignity of Character or a proper Sense of what is due to one's self in Society and the common Intercourse  of Life This Vice constitutes what we properly call  Meanness  when a Man can submit to the basest Slavery in order to gain his Ends fawn upon those who abuse him and degrade himself by Intimacies and Familiarities with undeserving Inferiors A certain Degree of generous Pride or Selfvalue is so requisite that the Absence of it in the Mind displeases after the same Manner as the Want of a Nose Eye or any of the most material Features of the Face or Members of the Body  The Absence of a Virtue may often be a Vice and that of the highest Kind as in the Instance of Ingratitude as well as Meanness Where we expect a Beauty the Disappointment gives an uneasy Sensation and produces a real Deformity An Abjectness of Character likewise is disgustful and contemptible in another View Where a Man has no Sense of Value in himself we are not likely to have any higher Estimation of him And if the same Person who crouches to his Superiors is insolent to his Inferiors as often happens this Contrariety of Behaviour instead of correcting the former Vice aggravates it extremely by the Addition of a Vice still more odious See Sect    THE Utility of COURAGE both to the Public and to the Person possest of it is an obvious Foundation of Merit But to any one who considers the Matter justly it will appear that this Quality has a peculiar Lustre which it derives altogether from itself and from that noble Elevation inseperable from it Its Figure drawn by Painters and by Poets displays in each Feature a Sublimity  and daring Confidence which catches the Eye engages the Affections and diffuses by Sympathy a like Sublimity of Sentiment over every Spectator  UNDER what glorious Colours does  Demosthenes  Pro    represent  Philip  where the Orator apologizes for his own Administration and justifies that pertinacious Love of Liberty with which he had inspir'd the  Arhenians  "I beheld  Philip  "  says he  "he with whom was your Contest resolutely while in Pursuit of Empire and Dominion exposing himself to every Wound his Eye goar'd his Neck wrested his Arm his Thigh piere'd whatever Part of his Body Fortune should seize on that cheerfully relinquishing provided that with what remain'd he might live in Honour and Renown And shall it be said that he born in  Pella  a Place heretofore mean and ignoble should be inspir'd with so high an Ambition and Thirst of Fame While you  Athenians  c"  These Praises excite the highest Admiration but the Views presented by the Orator carry us not we see beyond the Hero himself nor even regard the future advantageous Consequences of his Valour  THE martial Temper of the  Romans  inflam'd by continued Wars had rais'd their Esteem of Courage  so high that in their Language it was call'd  Virtue  by way of Excellence and Distinction from all other moral Qualities  The  Suevi in the Opinion of  Tacitus  De moribus Cerm    drest their Hair with a laudable Intent Not for the Pnrposes of loving or being belov'd They adorn'd themselves only for their Enemies and in order to appear more terrible  A Sentiment of the Historian which would sound a little oddly in other Nations and other Ages  THE  Scythians  according to  Herodotus  Lib  after fl  aing the Skin from the Heads of their Enemies whom they have slain dress it like Leather and use it as a Towel and whoever has most of these Towels is most esteem'd amongst them So much had martial Bravery in that Nation as well as in many others destroy'd the Sentiments of Humanity a Virtue surely much more useful and engaging  'Tis indeed observable that amongst all uncultivated Nations which have not as yet had full Experience of the Advantages attending Beneficence Justice and the social Virtues Courage is the predominant Excellence what is most celebrated by Poets recommended by Parents and Instructors and admir'd by the Public in general The Ethics  of  Homer  are in this Particular very different from those of  Fenelon  his elegant Imitator and such as are well suited to an Age wherein one Hero as remarkt by  Thucydides  Lib  could ask another without Offence if he was a Robber or not Such also very lately was the System of Ethics that prevail'd in many barbarous Parts of  Ireland  if we may credit  Spenser  in his judicious Account of the State of that Kingdom  It is a common Use says he amongst their Gentlemen's Sons that as soon as they are able to use their Weapons they strait gather to themselves three or four Stragglers or Kern with whom wandering a while up and down idly the Country taking only Meat he at last falleth into some bad Occasion that shall be offer'd which being once made known he is thenceforth counted a Men of Worth in whom there is Courage    OF the same Class of Virtues with Courage is that undisturb'd philosophical TRANQUILLITY superior to Pain Sorrow Anxiety and each Assault of adverse Fortune Conscious of his own Virtue say the Philosophers the Sage elevates himself above every Accident of Life and securely plac'd in the Temple of Wisdom looks down on inferior Mortals engag'd in Pursuit of Honours Riches Reputation and each frivolous Enjoyment These Pretensions no doubt when stretch'd to the utmost  are much too magnificent for human Nature They carry however a Grandeur with them which seizes the Spectator and strikes him with Admiration And the nearer we can approach in Practice to this sublime Tranquillity and Indifference for we must distinguish it from a stupid Insensibility the more secure Enjoyment shall we attain within ourselves and the more Greatness of Mind shall we discover to the World The philosophical Tranquillity may indeed be consider'd only as a Branch of Magnanimity  WHO admires not  Socrates  his perpetual Serenity and Contentment amidst the greatest Poverty and domestic Vexations his resolute Contempt of Riches and magnanimous Care of preserving Liberty while he refused all Assistance from his Friends and Disciples and avoided even the Dependance of an Obligation  Epictetus  had not so much as a Door to his little House or Hovel and therefore soon lost his Iron Lamp the only Furniture he had worth taking But resolving to disappoint all Robbers for the future he supply'd its Place with an earthen Lamp which he very peaceably kept Possession of ever after  IN Antiquity the Heroes of Philosophy as well as those of War and Patriotism have a Grandeur and Force of Sentiment which astonishes our narrow Souls and is rashly rejected as extravagant and supernatural They in their Turn I allow would have had equal Reason to consider as romantic and incredible the Degree of Humanity Clemency Order Tranquillity and other social Virtues to which in the Administration of Government we have attain'd in modern Times had any one been then able to have made a fair Representation of them Such is the Compensation which Nature or rather Education has made in the Distribution of Excellencies and Virtues in these different Ages  THE Merit of BENEVOLENCE arising from its Utility and its Tendency to the Good of Mankind has been already explain'd and is no doubt the Source of a  considerable  Part of that Esteem which is so universally pay'd it But it will also be allow'd that the very Softness and Tenderness of the Sentiment its engaging Endearments its fond Expressions its delicate Attentions and all that Flow of mutual Confidence and Regard which enter into a warm Attachment of Love and Friendship It will be allow'd I say that these Feelings being delightful in themselves are necessarily communicated to the  Spectators and melt them into the same Fondness and Delicacy The Tears naturally start in our Eyes on the Observation of a warm Sentiment of this Nature Our Breast heaves our Heart is agitated and every humane tender Principle of our Frame is set in Motion and gives us the purest and most satisfactory Enjoyment  WHEN Poets form Descriptions of  Elyzian  Fields where the blessed Inhabitants stand in no Need of each other's Assistance they yet represent them as maintaining a constant Entercourse of Love and Friendship and sooth our Fancy with the pleasing Image of these soft and gentle Passions The Idea of tender Tranquillity in a pastoral  Arcadia  is agreeable from a like Principle as has been observ'd above  Sect Part    WHO would live amidst perpetual Wrangling and Scolding and mutual Reproaches The Roughness and Harshness of these Emotions disturb and displease us We suffer by Contagion and Sympathy nor can we remain indifferent Spectators even tho' certain that no pernicious Consequences would ever follow from such angry Passions  As a certain Proof that the whole Merit of Benevolence is not deriv'd from its Usefulness we may observe that in a kind Way of Blame we say a Person is  too good  when he exceeds his Part in Society and carries his Attention for others beyond the proper Bounds and Measure In like Manner we say a Man is  too highspirited too intrepid too indifferent about Fortune  Reproaches which really at the bottom imply more Regard and Esteem than many Panegyrics Being accustom'd to rate the Merit and Demerit of Characters chiefly by their useful or pernicious Tendencies we cannot forbear applying the Epithet of Blame when we discover a Sentiment which rises to a Degree that is hurtful But it may happen at the same Time that its noble Elevation or its engaging Tenderness so seizes the Heart as rather to encrease our Friendship and Concern for the Person  Cheerfulness could starce admit of Blame from its Excess were it not that dissolute Mirth without a proper Cause or Subject is a sure Symptom and Characteristic of Folly and on that Account disgustful    THE Amours and Attachments of  Harry  the IVth during the civil Wars of the League frequently hurt his Interest and his Cause but all the young at  least and amorous who can sympathize with that Passion will allow that this very Weakness for they will readily call it such chiefly endears that Hero and interests them in his Fortunes  THE excessive Bravery and resolute Inflexibility of  Charles  the XIIth ruin'd his own Country and infested all his Neighbours But have such Splendour and Greatness in their Appearance as strike us with Admiration and they might in some Degree be even approv'd of if they betray'd not sometimes too evident Symptoms of Madness and Disorder  THE  Athenians  pretended to the first Invention of Agriculture and of Laws and always valu'd themselves extremely on the Benefit thereby procur'd to the whole Race of Mankind They also boasted and with Reason of their warlike Enterprizes particularly against those innumerable Fleets and Armies of  Persians  which invaded  Greece  during the Reign of  Darius  and of  Xerxes  But tho' there be no Comparison in Point of Utility betwixt these peaceful and military Honours yet we find that the Orators who have wrote such elaborate Panegyrics on that famous City have chiefly triumph'd in displaying the warlike Atchievments  Lysias Thucydides Plato  and  Isocrates  discover all of them the same Partiality which tho' condemn'd by calm  Reason and Reflection appears so natural in the Mind of Man  'Tis observable that the great Charm of Poetry consists in lively Pictures of the sublime Passions Magnanimity Courage Disdain of Fortune or those of the tender Affections Love and Friendship which warm the Heart and diffuse over us similar Sentiments and Emotions And tho' every Kind of Passion even the most disagreeable such as Grief and Anger are observ'd when excited by Poetry to convey a Pleasure and Satisfaction from a Mechanism of Nature not easy to be explain'd Yet those more elevated or softer Affections have a peculiar Influence and please from more than one Cause or Principle Not to mention that they alone interest us in the Fortune of the Persons represented or communicate any Esteem and Affection for their Character  AND can it possibly be doubted that this Talent itself of Poets to move the Passions this PATHETIC and SUBLIME of Sentiment is a very considerable Merit and being enhanc'd by its extreme Rarity may exalt the Person possest of it above every Character of the Age in which he lives The Prudence Address Steadiness and benign Government of  Augustus  adorn'd with all the  Splendour of his noble Birth and imperial Crown render him but an unequal Competitor for Fame with  Virgil  who lays nothing into the opposite Scale but the divine Beauties of his poetical Genius  THE very Sensibility to these Beauties or a DELICACY of Taste is itself a Beauty in any Character as conveying the purest the most durable and most innocent of all Enjoyments  THESE are some Instances of the Species of Virtue that are prais'd from the immediate Pleasure which they communicate to the Person possest of them No Views of Utility or of future beneficial Consequences enter into this Sentiment of Approbation yet is it of a similar Kind to that other Sentiment which arises from Views of public or private Utility The same social Sympathy we may observe or Fellowfeeling with human Happiness or Misery gives Rise to both and this Analogy in all the Parts of the present Theory may justly be regarded as a Confirmation of it  SECTION VIII  Of QUALITIES immediately agreeable to Others  'Tis the Definition of Virtue that 'tis  a Quality of the Mind agreeable to or approv'd of by every one that considers or contemplates it  But some Qualities produce Pleasure because they are useful to Society or useful or agreeable to the Person himself others produce it more immediately Which is the Class of Virtues here consider'd    AS the mutual Shocks in  Society  and the Oppositions of Interest and Selflove have constrain'd Mankind to establish the Laws of  Justice  in order to preserve the Advantages of common Assistance and Protection in like Manner the eternal Contrarieties in  Company  of Men's Pride and Selfconceit have introduc'd the Rules of GOODMANNERS or POLITENESS in order to facilitate the Intercourse of Minds and an undisturb'd Commerce and Conversation Amongst  wellbred People a mutual Deference is affected Contempt of others disguis'd Authority conceal'd Attention given to each in his Turn And an easy Stream of Conversation maintain'd without Vehemence without mutual Interruption without Eagerness for Victory and without any Airs of Superiority These Attentions and Regards are immediately  agreeable  to others abstracted from any Regard to Utility or beneficial Tendencies They conciliate Affection promote Esteem and enhance extremely the Merit of the Person who regulates his Behaviour by them  MANY of the Forms of Breeding are arbitrary and casual But the Thing exprest by them is still the same A  Spaniard  goes out of his own House before his Guest to signify that he leaves him Master of all In other Countries the Landlord walks out last as a common Mark of Deference and Regard  BUT in order to render a Man perfect  Goodcompany  he must have WIT and INGENUITY as well as Goodmanners What Wit is it may not be easy to define but 'tis easy surely to determine that 'tis a Quality immediately  agreeable  to others and communicating on its first Appearance a lively Joy and Satisfaction to every one that has any Comprehension  of it The most profound Metaphysics indeed might be employ'd in explaining the various Kinds and Species of Wit and many Classes of it which are now receiv'd on the simple Testimony of Taste and Sentiment might perhaps be resolv'd into more general Principles But this is sufficient for our present Purpose that it does affect Taste and Sentiment and bestowing an immediate Enjoyment is a sure Source of Approbation and Affection  IN Countries where Men pass all their Time in Conversation and Visits and Assemblies these  companionable  Qualities so to speak are of high Estimation and form a chief Part of personal Merit In Countries where Men live a more domestic Life and either are employ'd in Business or amuse themselves in a narrower Circle of Acquaintance the more solid Qualities are chiefly regarded Thus I have observ'd that amongst the  French  the first Questions with regard to a Stranger are  Is he polite Has he Wit  In our own Country the chief Praise bestow'd is always that of a  goodnatur'd sensible Fellow  IN Conversation the lively Spirit of Dialogue is  agreeable  even to those who desire not to have any Share of the Discourse Hence a Teller of long Stories or a pompous Declaimer is very little approv'd  of But most Men desire likewise their Share in the Conversation and regard with a very evil Eye that  Loquacity  which deprives them of a Right they are naturally so jealous of  THERE are a Set of harmless  Lyars  frequently to be met with in Company who deal much in the Marvelous and Extraordinary Their usual Intention is to please and entertain but as Men are delighted with nothing but what they conceive to be Truth these People mistake extremely the Means of pleasing and incur universal Blame Some Indulgence however to Lying or Fiction is given in  humourous  Stories because it is there agreeable and entertaining and Truth is not of any Importance  ELOQUENCE Genius of all Kinds even good Sense and sound Reasoning when it rises to an eminent Degree and is employ'd upon Subjects of any considerable Dignity and nice Discernment all these Qualities seem immediately agreeable and have a Merit distinct from their Usefulness Rarity likewise which so much enhances the Price of every Thing must set an additional Value on these noble Talents of the human Mind  MODESTY may be understood in different Senses even abstracted from Chastity which has  been already treated of It sometimes means that Tenderness and Nicety of Honour that Apprehension of Blame that Dread of Intrusion or Injury towards others that  Pudor  which is the proper Guardian of every Kind of Virtue and a sure Preservative against Vice and Corruption But its most usual Meaning is when it is oppos'd to  Impudence  and  Arrogance  and expresses a Diffidence of our own Judgment and a due Attention and Regard to others In young Men chiefly this Quality is a sure Sign of Goodsense and is also the certain Means of augmenting that Endowment by preserving their Ears open to Instruction and making them still grasp after new Attainments But it has a farther Charm to every Spectator by flattering each Man's Vanity and presenting the Appearance of a docile Pupil who receives with proper Attention and Respect every Word they utter  Men have in general a much greater Propensity to overvalue than undervalue themselves notwithstanding the Opinion of  Aristotle  This makes us more jealous of the Excess on the former Side and causes us to regard with a particular Indulgence all Tendency to Modesty and Selfdiffidence as esteeming the Danger less of falling into any vicious Extreme of that Nature 'Tis thus in Countries where Men's Bodies are apt to exceed in Corpulency personal Beauty is plac'd in a much greater Degree of Slenderness than in Countries where that is the most usual Defect Being so often struck with Instances of one Species of Deformity Men think they can never keep at too great a Distance from it and wish always to have a Leaning to the opposite Side In like Manner were the Door open'd to Selfpraise and were  Montaigne  's Maxim observ'd that one should say as frankly  I have Sense I have Learning I have Courage Beauty or Wit  as 'tis sure we often think so were this the Case I say every one is sensible that such a Flood of Impertinence would break in upon us as would render Society altogether intolerable For this Reason Custom has establish'd it as a Rule in common Societies that Men should never praise themselves and not even speak much of themselves and 'tis only amongst intimate Friends or People of very manly Behaviour that one is allow'd to do himself Justice No body finds fault with  Maurice  Prince of  Orange  for his Reply to one who ask'd him whom he esteem'd the first General of the Age  The Marquis de  Spinola said he  is the second  Tho' 'tis even observable that the Selfpraise imply'd is here better imply'd than if it had been directly express'd without any Cover or Disguise  He must be a very superficial Thinker who imagines that all Instances of mutual Deference are to be understood in earnest and that a Man would be more esteemable for being ignorant of his own Merits and Accomplishments A small Byass towards Modesty even in the internal Sentiments is favourably regarded especially in young People and a strong Byass is requir'd in the outward Behaviour But this excludes not a noble Pride and Spirit which may openly display itself in its full Extent when one lies under Calumny or Oppression of any Kind The generous Contumacy of  Socrates  as  Cicero  calls it has been highly celebrated in all Ages and when join'd to the usual Modesty of his Behaviour forms a most shining Character  Iphicrates  the  A  benian  General being accus'd of betraying the Interests of his Country ask'd his Accuser  Would you  says he  on a like Occasion have been guilty of that Crime By no Means  reply'd the other  And can you then imagine  cry'd the Hero  that  Iphicrates  would be guilty  Quinctil Lib Cap In short a generous Spirit and Selfvalue well founded decently disguis'd and courageously supported under D  stress and Calumny is a very great Virtue and seems to derive its Merit from the noble Elevation of its Sentiment or its immediate Agreeableness to its Possessor In ordinary Characters we approve of a Byass to Modesty which is immediately agreeable to others The vic  ous Excess of the former Virtue  viz  Insolence or Haughtiness is immediately disagreeable to others The Excess of the latter is so to the Possessor Thus are the Boundaries of these Duties adjusted    A DESIRE of Fame Reputation or a Character with others is so far from being blameable that it  seems inseparable from Virtue Genius Capacity and a generous or noble Disposition An Attention even to trivial Matters in order to please is also expected and demanded by Society and no one is surpriz'd if he finds a Man in Company to observe a greater Elegance of Dress and more pleasant Flow of Conversation than when he passes his Time at home and altogether with his own Family Wherein then consists VANITY which is so justly regarded as a Fault or Imperfection It seems to consist chiefly in such an intemperate Display of our Advantages Honours and Accomplishments in such an importunate and open Demand of Praise and Admiration as is offensive to others and encroaches too far on  their  secret Vanity and Ambition It is besides a sure Symptom of the Want of true Dignity  and Elevation of Mind which is so great an Ornament to any Character For why that impatient Desire of Applause as if you were not justly entitled to it and might not reasonably expect it would for ever attend you Why so anxious to inform us of the great Company you have kept the obliging Things that were said to you the Honours the Distinctions you met with as if these were not Things of Course and what we could readily of ourselves have imagin'd without being told of them  DECENCY or a proper Regard to Age Sex Character and Station in the World may be rank'd among the Qualities which are immediately agreeable to others and which by that Means acquire Praise and Approbation An effeminate Behaviour in a Man a rough Manner in a Woman these are ugly because unsuitable to each Character and different from the Qualities we expect in the Sexes 'Tis as if a Tragedy abounded in comic Beauties or a Comedy in tragic The Disproportions hurt the Eye and convey a disagreeable Sentiment to the Spectators the Source of Blame and Disapprobation This is that  Indecorum  which is explain'd so much at large by  Cicero  in his Offices  AMONGST the other Virtues we may also give CLEANLINESS a Place since it naturally renders us agreeable to others and is no inconsiderable Source of Love and Affection No one will deny that a Negligence in this Particular is a Fault and as Faults are nothing but smaller Vices and this Fault can have no other Origin than the uneasy Sensation which it excites in others we may in this Instance seemingly so trivial clearly discover the Origin of moral Distinctions about which the Learned have involved themselves in such Mazes of Perplexity and Error  BUT besides all the  agreeable  Qualities the Origin of whose Beauty we can in some Degree explain and account for there still remains something mysterious and unaccountable which conveys an immediate Satisfaction to the Spectators but how or why or for what Reason they cannot pretend to determine There is a MANNER a Grace a Genteelness an Iknownotwhat which some Men possess above others which is very different from external Beauty and Comeliness and which however catches our Affection almost as suddenly and powerfully And tho' this  Manner  be chiefly talk'd of in the Passion betwixt the Sexes where the conceal'd Magic is easily explain'd yet surely much of it prevails  in all our Estimation of Characters and forms no inconsiderable Part of personal Merit This Class of Virtues therefore must be trusted entirely to the blind but sure Testimony of Taste and Sentiment and must be consider'd as a Part of Ethics left by Nature to baffle all the Pride of Philosophy and make her sensible of her narrow Boundaries and slender Acquisitions  WE approve of another because of his Wit Politeness Modesty Decency or any agreeable Quality he possesses although he be not of our Acquaintance nor has ever given us any Entertainment by Means of these Accomplishments The Idea which we form of their Effect on his Acquaintance has an agreeable Influence on our Imagination and gives us the Sentiment of Approbation This Principle enters into all the Judgments which we form concerning Morals  SECTION IX  CONCLUSION of the Whole  PART I  IT may justly appear surprizing that any Man in so late an Age should find it requisite to prove by elaborate Reasonings that VIRTUE or PERSONAL MERIT consists altogether in the Possession of Qualities  useful  or  agreeable  to the  Person himself  or to  others  It might be expected that this Principle would have occur'd even to the first rude unpractis'd Enquirers concerning Morals and been receiv'd from its own Evidence without any Argument or Disputation Whatever is valuable in any Kind so naturally classes itself under the Division of  useful  or  agreeable  the  utile  or the  dulce  that 'tis not easy to imagine why we should ever seek farther or consider the Question as a Matter of nice Research or Enquiry And as every Thing  useful or agreeable must possess these Qualities with regard either to the  Person himself  or to  others  the compleat Delineation or Description of Merit seems to be perform'd as naturally as a Shadow is cast by the Sun or an Image is reflected upon Water If the Ground on which the Shadow is cast be not broken and uneven nor the Surface from which the Image is reflected disturb'd and confus'd a just Figure is immediately presented without any Art or Attention And it seems a reasonable Presumption that Systems and Hypotheses have perverted our natural Understanding when a Theory so simple and obvious could so long have escap'd the most elaborate Scrutiny and Examination  BUT however the Case may have far'd with Philosophy in common Life these Principles are still implicitely maintain'd nor is any other Topic of Praise or Blame ever recur'd to when we employ any Panegyric or Satyre any Applause or Censure of human Action and Behaviour If we observe Men in every Intercourse of Business or Pleasure in each Conference and Conversation we shall find them no where except in the Schools at any Loss upon this Subject What so natural for Instance as the following Dialogue You are very happy we shall suppose one to say addressing himself to  another that you have given your Daughter to  Cleanthes  He is a Man of Honour and Humanity Every one who has any Intercourse with him is sure of  fair  and  kind  Treatment  Qualities useful to others  I congratulate you too says another on the promising Expectations of this Soninlaw whose assiduous Application to the Sudy of the Laws whose quick Penetration and early Knowledge both of Men and Business prognosticate the greatest Honours and Advancement  Qualities useful to the Person himself  You surprize me much replies a third when you talk of  Cleanthes  as a Man of Business and Application I met him lately in a Circle of the gayest Company and he was the very Life and Soul of our Conversation So much Wit with Goodmanners so much Gallantry without Affectation so much ingenious Knowledge so genteely deliver'd I have never before observ'd in any one  Qualities immmediately agreeable to others  You would admire him still more says a fourth if you knew him more familiarly That Cheerfulness which you might remark in him is not a sudden Flash struck out by Company It runs thro' the whole Tenor of his Life and preserves a perpetual Serenity on his Countenance and Tranquillity in his Soul He has met with severe Trials Misfortunes as well as Dangers and by his Greatness of Mind was still  superior to all of them  Qualities immediately agreeable to the Person himself  The Image Gentlemen you have here delineated of  Cleanthes  cry I is that of accomplish'd Merit Each of you has given a Stroke of the Pencil to his Figure and you have unawares exceeded all the Pictures drawn by  Gratian  or  Castiglione  A Philosopher might select this Character as a Model of perfect Virtue  AND as every Quality which is useful or agreeable to ourselves or others is in common Life admitted under the Denomination of Virtue or personal Merit so no other will ever be receiv'd where Men judge of Things by their natural unprejudic'd Reason without the delusive Glosses of Superstition and false Religion Celibacy Fasting Penances Mortification Selfdenial Humility Silence Solitude and the whole Train of monkish Virtues for what Reason are they every where rejected by Men of Sense but because they serve no Manner of Purpose neither advance a Man's Fortune in the World nor render him a more valuable Member of Society neither qualify him for the Entertainment of Company nor encrease his Power of Selfenjoyment We observe on the contrary that they cross all these desirable Ends stupify the Understanding and harden the Heart obscure the Fancy  and sower the Temper We justly therefore transfer them to the opposite Column and place them in the Catalogue of Vices nor has any Superstition Force sufficient amongst Men of the World to pervert entirely these natural Sentiments A gloomy hairbrain'd Enthusiast after his Death may have Place in the Calendar but will scarce ever be admitted when alive into Intimacy and Society except by those who are as delirious and dismal as himself  IT seems a Happiness in the present Theory that it enters not into that vulgar Dispute concerning the  Degrees  of Benevolence or Selflove which prevail in human Nature a Dispute which is never likely to have any Issue both because Men who have taken Party are not easily convinc'd and because the Phaenomena which can be produc'd on either Side are so dispers'd so uncertain and subject to so many Interpretations that 'tis scarce possible accurately to compare them or draw from them any determinate Inference or Conclusion 'Tis sufficient for our present Purpose if it be allow'd what surely without the greatest Absurdity cannot be disputed that there is some Benevolence however small infus'd into our Bosom some Spark of Friendship for human Kind some Particle of the Dove kneaded into our Frame along with the Elements of the  Wolf and Serpent Let these generous Sentiments be suppos'd ever so weak let them be hardly sufficient to move even a Hand or Finger of our Body they must still direct the Determinations of our Mind and where every Thing else is equal produce a cool Preference of what is useful and serviceable to Mankind above what is pernicious and dangerous A  moral Distinction  therefore immediately arises a general Sentiment of Blame and Approbation a Tendency however faint to the Objects of the one and a proportionable Aversion to those of the other Nor will those Reasoners who so earnestly maintain the predominant Selfishness of human Kind be any way scandaliz'd at hearing of the weak Sentiments of Virtue implanted in our Nature On the contrary they are found as ready to maintain the one Tenet as the other and their Spirit of Satyre for such it appears rather than of Corruption naturally gives Rise to both Opinions which have indeed a great and almost indissoluble Connexion together  AVARICE Ambition Vanity and all Passions vulgarly tho' improperly compriz'd under the Denomination of  Selflove  are here excluded from our Theory concerning the Origin of Morals not because they are too weak but because they have not a proper Direction for that Purpose The Notion of Morals implies some Sentiment common to all  Mankind which recommends the same Object to general Approbation and makes every Man or most Men agree in the same Opinion or Decision concerning it It also implies some Sentiment so universal and comprehensive as to extend to all Mankind and render the Actions and Conduct even of Persons the most remote an Object of Censure or Applause according as they agree or disagree with that Rule of Right which is establish'd These two requisite Circumstances belong alone to the Sentiment of Humanity here insisted on The other Passions produce in every Breast many strong Sentiments of Desire and Aversion Affection and Hatred but these neither are felt so much in common nor are so comprehensive as to be the Foundation of any general System and establish'd Theory of Blame or Approbation  WHEN a Man denominates another his  Enemy  his  Rival  his  Antagonist  his  Adversary  he is understood to speak the Language of Selflove and to express Sentiments peculiar to himself and arising from his particular Circumstances and Situation But when he bestows on any Man the Epithets of  vicious  or  odious  or  deprav'd  he then speaks another Language and expresses Sentiments in which he expects all his Audience are to concur with him He must here therefore depart from his private and particular  Situation and must choose a Point of View common to him with others He must move some universal Principle of the human Frame and touch a String to which all Mankind have an Accord and Symphony If he means therefore to express that this Man possesses Qualities whose Tendency is pernicious to Society he has chosen this common Point in View and has touch'd the Principle of Humanity in which every Man in some Degree concurs While the human Heart is compounded of the same Elements as at present it will never be altogether indifferent to the Good of Mankind nor entirely unaffected with the Tendencies of Characters and Manners And tho' this Affection of Humanity may not generally be esteem'd so strong as Ambition or Vanity yet being common to all Men it can alone be the Foundation of Morals or of any general System of Conduct and Behaviour One Man's Ambition is not another's Ambition nor will the same Event or Object satisfy both But the Humanity of one Man is the Humanity of every one and the same Object touches this Passion in all human Creatures  BUT the Sentiments which arises from Humanity are not only the same in all human Creatures and produce the same Approbation or Censure but they also comprehend all human Creatures nor is there  any one whose Conduct and Character is not by their Means an Object to every one of Censure or Approbation On the contrary those other Passions commonly denominated selfish both produce different Sentiments in each Individual according to his particular Situation and also contemplate the greatest Part of Mankind with the utmost Indifference and Unconcern Whoever has a high Regard and Esteem for me flatters my Vanity whoever expresses Contempt mortifies and displeases me But as my Name is known but to a small Part of Mankind there are few that come within the Sphere of this Passion or excite on its Account either my Affection or Disgust But if you represent a tyrannical insolent or barbarous Behaviour in any Country or in any Age of the World I soon carry my Eye to the pernicious Tendency of such a Conduct and feel the Sentiments of Repugnance and Displeasure towards it No Character can be so remote as to be in this Light altogether indifferent to me What is beneficial to Society or to the Person himself must still be prefer'd And every Quality or Action of every human Being must by this Means be rank'd under some Class or Denomination expressive of general Censure or Applause  WHAT more therefore can we ask to distinguish the Sentiments dependant on Humanity from those  any other Passion or to satisfy us  the Origin of Morals and not the  Whatever Conduct gains my Approbation by  Humanity procures also the Applause o  all Mankind by affecting the same Principle in  But what serves my Avarice or Ambition pleases only these Passions in me and affects not the Avarice or Ambition of the rest of Mankind No Conduct in any Man which has a beneficial Tendency but is agreeable to my Humanity however remote the Person But every Man so far remov'd as neither to cross nor serve my Avarice and Ambition is altogether indifferent to those Passions The Distinction therefore betwixt those different Species of Sentiment being so strong and evident Language must soon be moulded upon it and must invent a peculiar Set of Terms to express those universal Sentiments of Censure or Approbation which arise from Humanity or from Views of general Usefulness and its contrary VIRTUE and VICE become then known Morals are recogniz'd Certain general Ideas are fram'd of human Conduct and Behaviour Such Measures are expected from Men in such Situations This Action is determin'd conformable  to our abstract Rule that other contrary And by such universal Principles are the particular Sentiments of Selflove frequently controul'd and limited  It seems certain both from Reason and Experience that a rude untaught Savage regulates chiefly his Love and Hatred by the Ideas of private Utility and Injury and has but faint Conceptions of a general Rule or System of Behaviour The Man who stands opposite to him in Battle he hates heartily not only for the present Moment which is almost unavoidable but for ever after not is he satisfy'd without the most extreme Punishment and Vengeance But we accustom'd to Society and to more enlarg'd Reflections consider that this Man is serving his own Country and Community that any Man in the same Situation would do the same that we ourselves in like Circumstances observe a like Conduct that in general human Society is best supported on such Maxims And by these Suppositions and Views we correct in some Measure our ruder and narrower Passions And tho' much of our Friendship and Enmity be still regulated by private Considerations of Benefit and Harm we pay at least this Homage to general Rules which we are accustom'd to respect that we commonly pervert our Adversary's Conduct by imputing Malice or Injustice to him in order to give Vent to those Passions which arise from Selflove and private Interest When the Heart is full of Rage it never wants Pretexts of this Nature tho' sometimes as frivolous as those from which  Horace  being almost crush'd by the Fall of a Tree affects to accuse of Parricide the first Planter of it    FROM Instances of popular Tumults Seditions Factions Panics and all Passions which are shar'd with a Multitude we may learn the Influence of Society in exciting and supporting any Emotion  while the most ungovernable Disorders are rais'd we find by that Means from the slightest and most frivolous Occasions  Solon  was no very cruel tho' perhaps an unjust Legislator who punish'd Neuters in civil Wars and few I believe would in such Cases incur the Penalty were their Affection and Discourse allow'd sufficient to absolve them No Selfishness and scarce any Philosophy has there Force sufficient to support a total Coolness and Indifference and he must be more or less than Man who kindles not in the common Blaze What Wonder then that moral Sentiments are found of such Influence in Life tho' springing from Principles which may appear at first Sight somewhat small and delicate But these Principles we must remark are social and universal They form in a Manner the  Party  of Humankind against Vice or Disorder its common Enemy And as the benevolent Concern for others is diffus'd in a greater or less Degree over all Men and is the same in all it occurs more frequently in Discourse is foster'd by Society and Conversation and the Blame and Approbation consequent on it are thereby rouz'd from that Lethargy into which they are probably lull'd in solitary and uncultivated Nature Other Passions tho' perhaps originally stronger yet being selfish and private are often overpower'd by its Force and  yield the Dominion of our Breast to those social and public Principles  ANOTHER Spring of our Constitution that brings great Addition of Force to moral Sentiment is the Love of Fame which rules with such uncontrol'd Authority in all generous Minds and is often the grand Object of all their Designs and Undertakings By our continual and earnest Pursuit of a Character a Name a Reputation in the World we bring our own Deportment and Conduct frequently in Review and consider how they appear in the Eyes of those who approach and regard us This constant Habit of surveying ourself as it were in Reflexion keeps alive all the Sentiments of Right and Wrong and begets in noble Natures a certain Reverence for themselves as well as others which is the surest Guardian of every Virtue The animal Conveniencies and Pleasures sink gradually in their Value while every inward Beauty and moral Grace is studiously acquir'd and the Mind is accomplish'd in each Perfection that can adorn or embellish a rational Creature  HERE is the most perfect Morality we are acquainted with Here is display'd the Force of many Sympathies Our moral Sentiment is itself a Feeling chiefly of that Nature And our Regard to a Character  with others seems to arise only from a Care of preserving a Character with ourselves in order to which we find it necessary to prop our tottering Judgment on the correspondent Approbation of Mankind  BUT in order to accommodate Matters and remove if possible every Difficulty let us allow all these Reasonings to be false Let us allow that when we resolve the Pleasure that arises from Views of Utility into the Sentiments of Humanity and Sympathy we have embrac'd a wrong Hypothesis Let us confess it necessary to find some other Explication of that Applause which is paid to all Objects whether inanimate animate or rational if they have a Tendency to promote the Welfare and Advantage of others However difficult it be to conceive that an Object is approv'd of on Account of its Tendency to a certain End while the End itself is totally indifferent let us swallow this Absurdity and consider what are the Consequences The preceding Delineation or Definition of VIRTUE must still retain its Evidence and Authority It must still be allow'd that every Quality of the Mind which is  useful  or  agreeable  to the  Person himself  or to  others  communicates a Pleasure to the Spectator engages his Esteem and is admitted under the honourable Denomination of Virtue or Merit Are  not Justice Fidelity Honour Veracity Allegiance Chastity esteem'd solely on Account of their Tendency to promote the Good of Society Is not that Tendency inseperable from Humanity Benevolence Lenity Generosity Gratitude Moderation Tenderness Friendship and all the other social Virtues Can it possibly be doubted that Industry Discretion Frugality Secrecy Order Perseverance Forethought Judgment and that whole Class of Virtues of which many Pages would not contain the Catalogue can it be be doubted I say that the Tendency of these Virtues to promote the Interest and Happiness of their Possessor is the sole Foundation of their Merit Who can dispute that a Mind which supports a perpetual Serenity and Cheerfulness a noble Dignity and undaunted Spirit a tender Affection and Goodwill to all around as it has more Enjoyment within itself is also a more animating and rejoicing Spectacle than if dejected with Melancholy tormented with Anxiety irritated with Rage or sunk into the most abject Baseness and Degeneracy And as to the Qualities immediately  agreeable to others  they speak sufficiently for themselves and he must be unhappy indeed either in his own Temper or in his Situation and Circumstances who has never perceiv'd the Charms of a facetious Wit or flowing Affability of a delicate  Modesty or decent Genteelness of Address and Manner  I AM sensible that nothing can be more unphilosophical than to be positive or dogmatical on any Subject and that even if  excessive  Scepticism could be maintain'd it would not be more destructive to all just Reasoning and Enquiry I am convinc'd that where Men are the must sure and arrogant they are commonly the most mistaken and have there given Reins to Passion without that proper Deliberation and Suspence which can alone secure them from the grossest Absurdities Yet I must confess that this Enumeration puts the Matter in so strong a Light that I cannot  at present  be more assur'd of any Truth which I learn from Reasoning and Argument than that Virtue consists altogether in the Usefulness or Agreeableness of Qualities to the Person himself possest of them or to others who have any Intercourse with him But when I reflect that tho' the Bulk and Figure of the Earth have been measur'd and delineated tho' the Motions of the Tides have been accounted for the Order and Oeconomy of the heavenly Bodies subjected to their proper Laws and INFINITE itself reduc'd to Calculation yet Men still dispute concerning the Foundation of their moral Duties When I reflect on this I say I fall back into Diffidence and Scepticism  and suspect that an Hypothesis so obvious▪ had it been a true one would long 'ere now have been receiv'd by the unanimous Suffrage and Consent of Mankind  PART II  THERE remains nothing but to consider briefly our  Obligation  to Virtue and to enquire whether every Man who has any Regard to his own Happiness and Welfare will not best find his Account in the Practice of every moral Duty If this can be clearly ascertain'd from the foregoing Theory we shall have the Satisfaction to reflect that we have advanc'd Principles which not only 'tis hop'd will stand the Test of Reasoning and Enquiry but may contribute to the Amendment of Men's Lives and their Improvement in Morality and social Virtue And tho' the philosophical Truth of any Proposition by no Means depends on its Tendency to promote the Interest of Society yet a Man has but a bad Grace who delivers a Theory however true which he must confess leads to a Practice dangerous and pernicious Why rake into those Corners of Nature which spread a Nuisance all around Why dig up the Pestilence from the Pit in which it is bury'd The Ingenuity of your  Researches may be admir'd but your Systems will be detested And Mankind will agree if they cannot refute them to sink them at least in eternal Silence and Oblivion Truths which are  pernicious  to Society if any such there be will yield to Errors which are salutary and  advantageous  BUT what philosophical Truths can be more advantageous to Society than those here deliver'd which represent Virtue in all her genuine and most engaging Charms and make us approach her with Ease Familiarity and Affection The dismal Dress falls off with which many Divines and some Philosophers had cover'd her and nothing appears but Gentleness Humanity Beneficence Affability nay even at proper Intervals Play Frolic and Gaiety She talks not of useless Austerities and Rigors Sufferance and Selfdenial She declares that her sole Purpose is to make her Votaries and all Mankind during every Instant of their Existence if possible cheerful and happy nor does she ever willingly part with any Pleasure but in Hopes of ample Compensation in some other Period of their Lives The sole Trouble she demands is that of just Calculation and a steady Preference of the greater Happiness And if any austere Pretenders approach her Enemies to Joy and Pleasure she either rejects them as Hypocrites and Deceivers or if she admits them in her  Train they are rank'd however among the least favour'd of her Votaries  AND indeed to drop all figurative Expression what Hopes can we ever have of engaging Mankind to a Practice which we confess full of Austerity and Rigour Or what Morality can ever serve any useful Purpose unless it can show by a particular Detail that all the Duties it recommends are also the true Interest of each Individual And the peculiar Advantage of the foregoing Theory seems to be that it furnishes proper Mediums for that Purpose  THAT the Virtues which are immediately  useful  or  agreeable  to the Person possest of them are desirable in a View to Selfinterest it would surely be superfluous to prove Moralists indeed may spare themselves all the Pains they often take in recommending these Duties To what Purpose collect Arguments to evince that Temperance is advantageous and the Excesses of Pleasure hurtful When it appears that these Excesses are only denominated such because they are hurtful and that if the unlimited Use of strong Liquors for Instance no more impair'd Health or the Faculties of the Mind and Body than the Use of Air or Water it would not be a whit more vicious or blameable  IT seems equally superfluous to prove that the  companionable  Virtues of Goodmanners and Wit Decency and Genteelness are more desirable than the contrary Qualities Vanity alone without other Considerations is a sufficient Motive to make us wish the Possession of these Accomplishments No Man was ever willingly deficient in this Particular All our Failures here proceed from bad Education Want of Capacity or a perverse and unpliable Disposition Would you have your Company coveted admir'd follow'd rather than hated despis'd avoided Can any one seriously deliberate in the Case As no Enjoyment is sincere without some Reference to Company and Society so no Society can be agreeable or even tolerable where a Man feels his Presence unwelcome and discovers all around him Symptoms of Aversion and Disgust  BUT why in the greater Society or Confederacy of Mankind should not the Case be the same as in particular Clubs and Companies Why is it more doubtful that the enlarg'd Virtues of Humanity Generosity Beneficence are desirable with a View to Happiness and Selfinterest than the limited Endowments of Ingenuity and Politeness Are we apprehensive that those social Affections have a greater and more immediate Interference than any  other Pursuits with private Utility and cannot be gratify'd without some important Sacrifices of Honour and Advantage If so we are but ill instructed in the Nature of the human Passions and are more influenc'd by verbal Distinctions than by real Differences  WHATEVER Contradiction may vulgarly be suppos'd betwixt the  social  and  selfish  Sentiments or Dispositions they are really no more opposite than selfish and ambitious selfish and revengeful selfish and vain 'Tis requisite there be an original Propensity of some Kind in order to be a Basis to Selflove by giving a Relish to the Objects of its Pursuit and none more fit for this Purpose than Beneficence or Humanity The Goods of Fortune are spent in one Gratification or other The Miser who accumulates his annual Income and lends it out at Interest has really spent it in the Gratification of his Avarice And 'twould be difficult to show why a Man is more a Loser by a generous Action than by any other Method of Expence since the utmost he can attain by the most elaborate Selfishness is the Indulgence of some Affection  NOW if Life without Passion must be altogether insipid and tiresome let a Man suppose he has full Power of modelling his own Disposition and let  him deliberate what Appetite or Desire he would choose for the Foundation of his Happiness and Enjoyment Every Affection he would observe when gratify'd by Success gives a Satisfaction proportion'd to its Force and Violence but besides this Advantage common to all the immediate Feeling of Benevolence and Friendship Humanity and Kindness is sweet smooth tender and agreeable independent of all Fortune and Accidents These Virtues are besides attended with a pleasing Consciousness and Remembrance and keep us in Humour with ourselves as well as others while we retain the agreeable Reflection of having done our Part towards Mankind and Society And tho' all Men show a Jealousy of our Success in the Pursuits of Avarice or Ambition yet are we almost sure of their Goodwill and Goodwishes so long as we persevere in the Paths of Virtue and employ ourselves in the Execution of generous Plans and Purposes What other Passion is there where we shall find so many Advantages united an agreeable Sentiment a pleasing Consciousness a good Reputation But of these Truths we may observe Men are of themselves pretty much convinc'd nor are they deficient in their Duty to Society because they would not wish to be generous friendly and humane but because they do not feel themselves such  TREATING Vice with the greatest Candour and making it all possible Concessions we must acknowledge that there is not in any Instance the smallest Pretext for giving it the Preference above Virtue with a View to Selfinterest except perhaps in the Case of Justice where a Man taking Things in a certain Light may often seem to be a Loser by his Integrity And tho' 'tis acknowledg'd that without a Regard to Property no Society could subsist yet according to the imperfect Way in which human Affairs are conducted a sensible Knave in particular Incidents may think that an Act of Iniquity or Infidelity will make a considerable Addition to his Fortune without causing any considerable Breach in the social Union and Confederacy That  Honesty is the best Policy  may be a good general Rule but is liable to many Exceptions And he it may perhaps be judg'd conducts himself with most Wisdom who observes the general Rule and takes Advantage of all the Exceptions  I MUST confess that if a Man thinks that this Reasoning much requires an Answer 'twill be a little difficult to find any that will to him appear satisfactory and convincing If his Heart does not rebel against such pernicious Maxims if he feels no  Reluctance to the Thoughts of Villainy or Baseness he has indeed lost a considerable Motive to Virtue and we may expect that his Practice will be answerable to his Speculation But in all ingenuous Natures the Antipathy to Treachery and Roguery is too strong to be counterballanc'd by any Views of Profit or pecuniary Advantage Inward Peace of Mind Consciousness of Integrity a satisfactory Review of our own Conduct these are Circumstances very requisite to Happiness and will be cherish'd and cultivated by every honest Man who feels the Importance of them  SUCH a one has besides the frequent Satisfaction of seeing Knaves with all their pretended Cunning and Ability betray'd by their own Maxims and while they purpose to cheat only with Moderation and Secrecy a tempting Incident occurs Nature is frail and they give into the Snare whence they can never extricate themselves without a total Loss of Reputation and the Forfeiture of all future Trust and Confidence with Mankind  BUT were they ever so secret and successful the honest Man if he has any Tincture of Philosophy or even common Observation and Reflection will discover that they themselves are in the End the greatest Dupes and have sacrific'd the invaluable  Enjoyment of a Character with themselves at least for the Acquisition of worthless Toys and Gewgaws How little is requisite to supply the  Necessities  of Nature And in the View of  Pleasure  what Comparison betwixt the unbought Satisfactions of Conversation Society Study even Health and the common Beauties of Nature but especially the peaceful Reflection on one's own Conduct What Comparison I say betwixt these and the feverish empty Amusements of Luxury and Expence These natural Pleasures indeed are really without Price both because they are below all Price in their Attainment and above it in their Enjoyment  APPENDIX I  Concerning moral SENTIMENT  IF the foregoing Hypothesis be receiv'd 'twill now be easy for us to determine the Question first stated  Sect I  concerning the general Principles of Morals and tho' we postpon'd the Decision of that Question lest it should then involve us in intricate Speculations which are totally unfit for moral Discourses we may resume it at present and examine how far either  Reason  or  Sentiment  enters into all moral Determinations  THE chief Foundation of moral Praise being suppos'd to lie in the Usefulness of any Quality or Action 'tis evident that  Reason  must enter for a considerable Share in all Determinations of this Kind since nothing but that Faculty can instruct us in the Tendency of Qualities and Actions and point  out their beneficial Consequences to Society and to their Possessors In many Cases this is an Affair liable to great Controversy Doubts may arise opposite Interests occur and a Preference must be given to one Side from very nice Views and a small Overballance of Utility This is particularly remarkable in Questions with regard to Justice as is indeed natural to suppose from that Species of Utility which attends this Virtue  See Appendix II  Were every single Instance of Justice like that of Benevolence beneficial and useful to Society this would be a more simple State of the Case and seldom liable to great Controversy But as single Instances of Justice are often pernicious in their first and immediate Tendency and as the Advantage to Society results only from the Observance of the general Rule and from the Concurrence and Combination of several Persons in the same equitable Conduct the Case here becomes more intricate and involv'd The various Circumstances of Society the various Consequences of any Practice the various Interests which may be propos'd These on many Occasions are doubtful and subject to great Discussion and Enquiry The Object of municipal Laws is to fix all Questions with regard to Justice The Debates of Civilians the Reflections of Politicians the Precedents  of Histories and public Records are all directed to the same Purpose And a very accurate  Reason  or  Judgment  is often requisite to give the true Determination amidst such intricate Doubts arising from obscure or opposite Utilities  BUT tho' Reason when fully assisted and improv'd be sufficient to instruct us in the pernicious or useful Tendencies of Qualities and Actions it is not alone sufficient to produce any moral Blame or Approbation Utility is only a Tendency to a certain End and were the End totally indifferent to us we should feel the same Indifference towards the Means 'Tis requisite a  Sentiment  should here display itself in order to give a Preference to the useful above the pernicious Tendencies This Sentiment can be no other than a Feeling for the Happiness of Mankind and a Resentment of their Misery since these are the different Ends which Virtue and Vice have a Tendency to promote Here therefore  Reason  instructs us in the several Tendencies of Actions and  Humanity  makes a Distinction in favour of those which are useful and beneficial  THIS Partition betwixt the Faculties of Understanding and Sentiment in all moral Decisions seems clear from the preceding Hypothesis But I shall suppose that Hypothesis false 'Twill then be  requisite to look out for some other Theory that may be satisfactory and I dare venture to affirm that none such will ever be found as long as we suppose Reason to be the sole Source of Morals To prove this it will be proper to weigh the five following Considerations  I 'Tis easy for a false Hypothesis to maintain some Appearance of Truth while it keeps altogether in Generals makes use of undefin'd Terms and employs Comparisons instead of Instances This is particularly remarkable in that Philosophy which ascribes the Discernment of all moral Distinctions to Reason alone without the Concurrence of Sentiment 'Tis impossible in any particular Instance that this Hypothesis can so much as be render'd intelligible whatever specious Figure it may make in general Declamations and Discourses Examine the Crime of  Ingratitude  for Instance which has Place wherever we observe Goodwill exprest and known along with Goodoffices perform'd on the one Side and a Return of Illwill or Indifference with Illoffices or Neglect on the other Anatomize all these Circumstances and examine by your Reason alone wherein consists the Demerit or Blame You never will come to any Issue or Conclusion  REASON judges either of  Matter of Fact  or of  Relations  Enquire then  first  where is that Matter of Fact which we here call  Crime  point it out determine the Time of its Existence describe its Essence or Nature explain the Sense or Faculty to which it discovers itself It resides in the Mind of the Person who is ungrateful He must therefore feel it and be conscious of it But nothing is there except the Passion of Illwill or absolute Indifference You cannot say that these of themselves always and in all Circumstances are Crimes No They are only Crimes when directed towards Persons who have before exprest and display'd Goodwill towards us Consequently we may infer that the Crime of Ingratitude is not any particular individual  Fact  but arises from a Complication of Circumstances which being presented to the Spectator excites the  Sentiment  of Blame by the particular Structure and Fabric of his Mind  THIS Representation you say is false Crime indeed consists not in a particular  Fact  of whose Reality we are assur'd by  Reason  But it consists in certain  moral Relations  discoverable by Reason in the same Manner as we discover by Reason the Truths of Geometry or Algebra But what are the Relations I ask of which you here talk In  the Case stated above I see first Goodwill and Goodoffices in one Person then Illwill and Illoffices in the other Betwixt these there is the Relation of  Contrariety  Does the Crime consist in that Relation But suppose a Person bore me Illwill or did me Illoffices and I in return were indifferent towards him or did him Goodoffices Here is the same Relation of  Contrariety  and yet my Conduct is highly laudable Twist and turn this Matter as much as you will you can never rest the Morality on Relation but must have Recourse to the Decisions of Sentiment  WHEN 'tis affirm'd that two and three are equal to the half of ten this Relation of Equality I understand perfectly I conceive that if ten be divided into two Parts of which one had as many Unites as the other and if any of these Parts be compar'd to two added to three it will contain as many Unites as that compound Number But when you draw thence a Comparison to moral Relations I own I am altogether at a loss to understand you A moral Action a Crime such as Ingratitude is a complicated Object Does the Morality consist in the Relation of its Parts to each other How After what Manner Specify the Relation Be more particular and explicite in your Propositions and you will easily see their Falshood  NO say you the Morality consists in the Relation of Action to the Rule of Right and they are denominated good or ill according as they agree or disagree with it What then is this Rule of Right Wherein does it consist How is it determin'd By Reason you'll say which examines the moral Relations of Actions So that moral Relations are determin'd by the Comparison of Actions to a Rule And the Role is determin'd by considering the moral Relations of Objects Is not this fine Reasoning  ALL this is Metaphysics you cry That is enough There needs nothing more to give a strong Presumption of Falshood Yes reply I Here are Metaphysics surely But they are all on your Side who advance an abstruse Hypothesis which can never be made intelligible nor quadrate to any particular Instance or Illustration The Hypothesis we embrace is plain It maintains that Morality is determin'd by Sentiment It defines Virtue to be  whatever mental Action or Quality gives to a Spectator the pleasing Sentiment of Approbation  and Vice the contrary We then proceed to examine a plain Matter of Fact  viz  what Actions have this Influence We consider all the Circumstances in which these Actions agree And from thence endeavour to  extract some general Observations with regard to these Sentiments If you call this Metaphysics and find any thing abstruse here you need only conclude that your Turn of Mind is not suited to the moral Sciences  II WHEN a Man at any Time deliberates concerning his own Conduct as whether he had better in a particular Emergence assist a Brother or a Benefactor he must consider these separate Relations with the whole Circumstances and Situation of the Persons in order to determine his superior Duty and Obligation And in order to determine the Proportion of Lines in any Triangle 'tis necessary to examine the Nature of that Figure and the Relations which its several Parts bear to each other But notwithstanding this apparent Similarity in the two Cases there is at the bottom an extreme Difference betwixt them A speculative Reasoner concerning Triangles or Circles considers the several known and given Relations of the Parts of these Figures and from thence infers some unknown Relation which is dependent on the former But in moral Deliberations we must be acquainted beforehand with all the Objects and all their Relations to each other and from a Comparison of the whole fix our Choice or Approbation No new Fact to be ascertain'd No new Relation to be  discover'd The whole Circumstances of the Case are suppos'd to be laid before us 'ere we can fix any Sentence of Blame or Approbation If any material Circumstance by yet unknown or doubtful we must first employ our Enquiry or intellectual Faculties to assure us of it and suspend for a Time all moral Decision or Sentiment While we are ignorant whether a Man was Aggressor or not how can we determine whether the person who kill'd him be criminal or innocent But after every Circumstance every Relation is known the Understanding has no farther Room to operate nor any Object on which it could employ itself The Approbation or Blame which then ensues cannot be the Work of the Judgment but of the Heart and is not a speculative Proposition or Affirmation but an active Feeling or Sentiment In the Disquisitions of the Understanding from known Circumstances and Relations we infer some new and unknown In moral Decisions the whole Circumstances and Relations must be antecedently known and the Mind from the Contemplation of the Whole feels some new Impression of Affection of Disgust Esteem or Contempt Approbation or Blame  HENCE the great Difference betwixt a Mistake of  Fact  and one of  Right  and hence the Reason why the one is commonly criminal and not the other  When  OEdipus  kill'd  Laius  he was ignorant of the Relation and from Circumstances innocent and involuntary form'd erroneous Opinions concerning the Action he committed But when  Nero  kill'd  Agrippina  all the Relations betwixt himself and the person and all the Circumstances of the Fact were antecedently known to him But the Motive of Revenge or Fear or Interest in his savage Heart prevail'd over the Sentiments of Duty and Humanity And when we express a Detestation against him to which he himself in a little Time became insensible 'tis not that we see any Relations of which he was ignorant but that from the Rectitude of our Disposition we feel Sentiments against which he was harden'd from Flattery and a long Perseverance in the most enormous Crimes In these Sentiments then not in a Discovery of Relations of any Kind do all moral Determinations consist Before we can pretend to form any Decision of this kind every Thing must be known and ascertain'd on the Side of the Object or Action Nothing remains but to feel on our Part some Sentiment of Blame or Approbation whence we pronounce the Action criminal or virtuous  III THIS Doctrine will become still more evident if we compare moral Beauty with natural to which in many Particulars it bears so near a Resemblance  'Tis on the Proportion Relation and Position of Parts that all natural Beauty depends but 'twould be absurd thence to infer that the Perception of Beauty like that of Truth in geometrical Problems consists altogether in the Perception of Relations and was perform'd entirely by the Understanding or intellectual Faculties In all the Sciences our Mind from the known Relations investigates the unknown But in all Decisions of Taste or external Beauty the whole Relations are beforehand obvious to the Eye and we thence proceed to feel a Sentiment of Complacency or Disgust according to the Nature of the Object and Disposition of our Organs  EUCLID  has fully explain'd all the Qualities of the Circle but has not in any Proposition said a Word of its Beauty The Reason is evident The Beauty is not a Quality of the Circle It lies not in any Part of the Line whose Parts are all equally distant from a common Center It is only the Effect which that Figure operates upon the Mind whose peculiar Fabric or Structure renders it susceptible of such Sentiments In vain would you look for it in the Circle or seek it either by your Senses or by mathematical Reasonings in all the Properties of that Figure  ATTEND to  Palladio  and  Perrault  while they explain all the Parts and Proportions of a Pillar They talk of the Cornice and Freeze and Base and Entablature and Shaft and Architrave and give the Description and Position of each of these Members But should you ask the Description and Position of its Beauty they would readily reply that the Beauty is not any of the Parts or Members of a Pillar but results from the Whole when that complicated Figure is presented to an intelligent Mind susceptible of those finer Sensations Till such a Spectator appear there is nothing but a Figure of such particular Dimensions and Proportions From his Sentiments alone arises its Elegance and Beauty  AGAIN attend to  Cicero  while he paints the Crimes of a  Verres  or a  Catiline  you must acknowledge that the moral Turpitude results in the same Manner from the Contemplation of the Whole when presented to a Being whose Organs have such a particular Structure and Formation The Orator may paint Rage Insolence Barbarity on the one Side Meekness Sufferance Sorrow Innocence on the other But if you feel no Indignation or Compassion arise in you from this Complication of Circumstances you would in vain ask him wherein consist the Crime or Villainy which he so vehemently  exclaims against At what Time or on what Subject it first began to exist And what has a few Months afterwards become of it when every Disposition and Thought of all the Actors is totally alter'd or annihilated No satisfactory Answer can be given to any of these Questions upon the abstract Hypothesis of Morals and we must at last acknowledge that the Crime or Immorality is no particular Fact or Relation which can be the Object of the Understanding But arises altogether from the Sentiment of Disapprobation which by the Structure of human Nature we unavoidably feel on the Apprehension of Barbarity or Treachery  IV INANIMATE Objects may bear to each other all the same Relations which we observe in moral Agents tho' the former can never be the Object of Love or Hatred nor are consequently susceptible of Merit or Iniquity A young Tree that overtops or destroys its Parent from whose Seed it sprung stands in all the same Relations with  Nero  when he murder'd  Agrippina  and if Morality consisted in any abstract Relations would no doubt be equally criminal  V IT appears evident that the ultimate Ends of human Actions can never in any Case be accounted for by  Reason  but recommend themselves entirely to  the Sentiments and Affections of Mankind without any Dependance on the intellectual Faculties Ask a Man  why he uses Exercise  he will answer  because he desires to keep his Health  If you then enquire  why he desires Health  he will readily reply  because Sickness is painful  If you push your Enquiries farther and desire a Reason  why he hates Pain  'tis impossible he can ever give any This is an ultimate End and is never refer'd to any other Object  PERHAPS to your second Question  why he desires Health  he may also reply that  'tis requisite for the Exercise of his Calling  If you ask  why he is anxious on that head  he will answer  because he desires to get Money  If you demand  Why It is the Instrument of Pleasure  says he And beyond this 'tis an Absurdity to ask for a Reason 'Tis impossible there can be a Progress  in infinitum  and that one Thing can always be the Reason why another is desir'd Something must be desirable on its own Account and because of its immediate Accord or Agreement with human Sentiment and Affection  NOW as Virtue is an End and is desirable on its own Account without Fee or Reward merely for the immediate Satisfaction it conveys 'tis requisite there should be some Sentiment which it touches some internal Taste or Feeling or whatever you  please to call it which distinguishes moral Good and Evil and which embraces the one and rejects the other  THUS the distinct Boundaries and Offices of  Reason  and  Taste  are easily ascertain'd The former conveys the Knowledge of Truth and Falshood The latter gives the Sentiment of Beauty and Deformity Vice and Virtue The one discovers Objects as they really stand in Nature without Addition or Diminution The other has a productive Faculty and guilding or staining all natural Objects with the Colours borrow'd from internal Sentiment raises in a Manner a new Creation Reason being cool and disengag'd is no Motive to Action and directs only the Impulse receiv'd from Appetite or Inclination by showing us the Means of obtaining Happiness or avoiding Misery Taste as it gives Pleasure or Pain and thereby constitutes Happiness or Misery becomes a Motive to Action and is the first Spring or Impulse to Desire and Volition From Circumstances and Relations known or suppos'd the former leads us to the Discovery of the conceal'd and unknown After all Circumstances and Relations are laid before us the latter makes us feel from the Whole a new Sentiment of Blame or Approbation The Standard of the one being founded on the Nature of Things is eternal and inflexible even by  the Will of the Supreme Being The Standard of the other arising from the internal Frame and Constitution of Animals is ultimately deriv'd from that Supreme Will who bestow'd on each being its peculiar Nature and arrang'd the several Classes and Orders of Existence  APPENDIX II  Some farther Considerations with regard to JUSTICE  THE Intention of this Appendix is to give some more particular Explication of the Origin and Nature of Justice and mark some Differences betwixt it and the other Virtues  THE social Virtues of Humanity and Benevolence exert their Influence immediately by a direct Tendency or Instinct which keeps chiefly in View the simple Object that moves the Affections and comprehends not any Scheme or System nor the Consequences resulting from the Concurrence Imitation or Example of others A Parent flies to the Relief of his Child transported by that natural Sympathy which actuates him and which affords no Leisure to reflect on the Sentiments or Conduct of the rest of Mankind in like Circumstances A generous  Man embraces cheerfully an Opportunity of serving his Friend because he then feels himself under the Dominion of the beneficent Affections nor is he concern'd whether any other Person in the Universe was ever before actuated by such noble Motives or will ever afterwards prove their Influence In all these Cases the social Passions have in View a single individual Object and pursue alone the Safety or Happiness of the Person lov'd and esteem'd With this they are satisfy'd In this they acquiesce And as the Good resulting from their benign Influence is in itself compleat and entire it also excites the moral Sentiment of Approbation without any Reflection on farther Consequences or more enlarg'd Views of the Concurrence or Imitation of the other Members of Society On the contrary were the generous Friend or disinterested Patriot to stand alone in the Practice of Beneficence this would rather inhance his Value in our Eyes and join the Praise of Rarity and Novelty to his other more exalted Merits  THE Case is not the same with the social Virtues of Justice and Fidelity They are highly useful or indeed absolutely necessary to the Wellbeing of Mankind But the Benefit resulting from them is not the Consequence of every individual single Act but arises from the whole Scheme or System concur'd  in by the whole or the greatest Part of the Society General Peace and Order is the Attendant of Justice or a general Abstinence from the Possessions of others But a particular Regard to the particular Right of one individual Citizen may frequently consider'd in itself be attended with pernicious Consequences The Result of the several Acts is here often directly opposite to that of the whole System of Actions and the former may be extremely hurtful while the latter is to the highest Degree advantageous Riches inherited from a Parent are in a bad Man's Hand the Instruments of Mischief The Right of Succession may in one Instance be hurtful Its Benefit arises only from the Observance of the general Rule and 'tis sufficient if Compensation be thereby made for all the Ills and Inconveniencies which flow from particular Characters and Situations  CYRUS  young and unexperienc'd consider'd only the individual Case before him and reflected on its limited Fitness and Convenience when he assign'd the long Coat to the tall Boy and the short Coat to the other of smaller Size His Governor instructed him better while he pointed out more enlarg'd Views and Consequences and inform'd his Pupil of the general inflexible Rules requisite to support general Peace and Order in Society  THE Happiness and Prosperity of Mankind arising from the social Virtue of Benevolence and its Subdivisions may be compar'd to a Wall built by many Hands which still rises by each Stone that is heap'd upon it and receives proportional Encrease to the Diligence and Care of each Workman The same Happiness rais'd by the social Virtue of Justice and its Subdivisions may be compar'd to the building of a Vault where each individual Stone would of itself fall to the Ground nor does the whole Fabric support itself but by the mutual Assistance and Combination of its correspondent Parts  ALL the Laws of Nature which regulate Property as well as all civil Laws are general and regard alone some essential Circumstances of the Case without taking into Consideration the Characters Situations and Connexions of the Persons concern'd or any particular Consequences that may result from the Determination of these Laws in every particular Case that offers They deprive without Scruple a beneficent Man of all his Possessions if acquir'd by Mistake without a good Title in order to bestow them on a selfish Miser who has already heap'd up immense Stores of superfluous Riches Public Utility requires that Property should be regulated by general inflexible Rules and tho'  such Rules are adopted as best serve the same End of public Utility 'tis impossible for them to prevent all particular Hardships or make beneficial Consequences result from every individual Case 'Tis sufficient if the whole Plan or Scheme be necessary to the Support of civil Society and if the Ballance of Good in the main does thereby preponderate much above that of Evil Even the general Laws of the Universe tho' plann'd by infinite Wisdom cannot exclude all Evil or Inconvenience in every particular Operation  IT has been asserted by some that all Justice arises from HUMAN CONVENTIONS and proceeds from the voluntary Choice Consent or Combination of Mankind If by  Convention  be here meant a  Promise  which is the most usual Sense of the Word nothing can be more absurd than this Position The Observance of Promises is itself one of the most considerable Parts of Justice and we are not surely bound to keep our Word because we have given our Word to keep it But if by Convention be meant a Sense of common Interest which Sense each Man feels in his own Breast which he observes in his Fellows and which carries him in concurrence with others into a general Plan or System of Actions that tend to public Utility it must be own'd that in this Sense Justice arises  from human Conventions For if it be allow'd what is indeed evident that the particular Consequences of a particular Act of Justice may be hurtful to the Public as well as to Individuals it follows that every Man in embracing that Virtue must have an Eye to the whole Plan or System and must expect the Concurrence of his Fellows in the same Conduct and Behaviour Were all his Views to terminate in the particular Consequences of each particular Act of his own his Benevolence and Humanity as well as Selflove might often prescribe to him Measures of Conduct very different from those which are agreeable to the strict Rules of Right and Justice  THUS two Men pull the Oars of a Boat by common Convention for common Interest without any Promise or Contract Thus Gold and Silver are made the Measures of Exchange thus Speech and Words and Language are fixt by human Convention and Agreement Whatever is advantageous to two or more Persons if all perform their Part but what loses all Advantage if only one perform can arise from no other Principle There would otherwise be no Motive for any one of them to enter into that Scheme of Conduct  This Theory concerning the Origin of Property and consequently of Justice is in the main the same with that hinted at and adopted by  Grotius Hinc discimus quae fuerit causa ab quam a primaeva communione rerum primo mobilium deinde immobilium discessum est nimirum quod cum non contenti homines vesci sponte natis antra habitare corpore aut nudo

ut per divisionem aut tacito ut per occupationem De jure belli pacis Lib Cap § Art      THE Word  natural  is commonly taken in so many Senses and is of such loose Signification that it seems to little Purpose to dispute whether Justice be natural or not If Selflove if Benevolence be natural to Man if Reason and Forethought be also natural then may the same Epithet be apply'd to Justice Order Fidelity Property Society Men's Inclination their Necessities lead them to combine their Understanding and Experience tell them that this Combination is impossible where each governs himself by no Rule and pays no Regard to the Possessions of others And from these Passions and Reflections conjoin'd as soon as we observe  like Passions and Reflections in others the Sentiment of Justice thro' all Ages has infallibly and certainly had place to some Degree or other in every Individual of human Species In so sagacious an Animal what necessarily arises from the Exertion of his intellectual Faculties may justly be esteem'd natural  Natural may be oppos'd either to what is  unusual miraculous or artificial  In the two former Senses Justice and Property are undoubtedly natural But as they suppose Reason Forethought Design and a social Union and Confederacy amongst Men perhaps that Epithet cannot strictly in the last Sense be apply'd to them Had Men liv'd without Society Property had never been known and neither Justice nor Injustice had ever existed But Society amongst human Creatures had been impossible without Reason and Forethought Inferior Animals that unite are guided by Instinct which supplies the Place of Reason But all these Dis  s are merely verbal    AMONGST all civiliz'd Nations it has been the constant Endeavour to remove every Thing arbitrary and partial from the Decision of Property and to fix the Sentence of Judges by such general Views and Considerations as may be equal to every Member of the Society For besides that nothing could be more dangerous than to accustom the Bench even in the smallest Instance to regard private Friendship or Enmity 'tis certain that Men  where they imagine that there was no other Reason for the Preference of their Adversary but personal Favour are apt to entertain the strongest Jealousy and Illwill against the Magistrates and Judges When natural Reason therefore points out no fixt View of public Utility by which a Controversy of Property can be decided positive Laws are often fram'd to supply its Place and direct the Procedure of all Courts of Judicature Where these too fail as often happens Precedents are call'd for and a former Decision tho' given itself without any sufficient Reason justly becomes a sufficient Reason for a new Decision If direct Laws and Precedents be wanting imperfect and indirect ones are brought in Aid and the controverted Case is rang'd under them by analogical Reasonings and Comparisons and Similitudes and Correspondencies that are often more fanciful than real In general it may safely be asserted that Jurisprudence is in this respect different from all the Sciences and in many of its nicer Questions there cannot properly be said to be Truth or Falshood on either Side If one Pleader brings the Case under any former Law or Precedent by a refin'd Analogy or Comparison the opposite Pleader is not at a Loss to find an opposite Analogy or Comparison And the Preference given by the Judge is often founded more on Taste and Imagination  than on any solid Argument Public Utility is the general View of all Courts of Judicature and this Utility too requires a stable Rule in all Controversies But where several Rules nearly equal and indifferent present themselves 'tis a very slight Turn of Thought which fixes the Decision in favour of either Party  A DIALOGUE  MY Friend  Palamedes  who is as great a Rambler in his Principles as in his Person and who has run over by Study and Travel almost every Region of the intellectual and material World surpriz'd me lately with an Account of a Nation with whom he told me he had pass'd a considerable Part of his Life and whom he found in the main an extreme civiliz'd intelligent People  THERE is a State say'd he in the World call'd  Fourli  no matter for its Longitude or Latitude whose Ways of thinking in many Things particularly in Morals are diametrically opposite to ours When I came amongst them I found I must submit to double Pains first to learn the Meaning of the Terms in their Language and then to know the Import of those Terms and the Praise or Blame attach'd to them After a Word had been explain'd to me and the Character which it exprest had  been describ'd I concluded that such an Epithet must necessarily be the greatest Reproach in the World and was extremely surpriz'd to find one in a public Company apply it to a Person with whom he liv'd in the strictest Intimacy and Friendship  You fancy  said I one Day to an Acquaintance  that  Changuis  is your mortal Enemy I love to extinguish Quarrels and I must therefore tell you that Heard him talk of you in the most advantageous Manner  But to my great Astonishment when I repeated  Changuis  's Words tho' I had both remember'd and understood them perfectly I found that they were taken for the most mortal Affront and that I had very innocently render'd the Breach betwixt these Persons altogether irreparable  As it was my Fortune to come amongst this People on a very advantageous Footing I was immediately introduc'd to the best Company and being desir'd to live with  Alcheic  I readily accepted his Invitation as I found him universally esteem'd for his personal Merit and indeed regarded by every one in  Fourli  as a perfect Character  ONE Evening he invited me as an Amusement to bear him Company in a Serenade which he intended to give  Gulki  with whom he told me he was extremely enamour'd and I foon found his  Taste was not singular For we met many of his Rivals who had come on the same Errand I very naturally concluded that this Flame of his must be one of the finest Women in Town and I already felt a secret Inclination to see her and be acquainted with her But as the Moon began to rise I was much surpriz'd to find that we were in the Midst of the University where  Gulki  study'd And I was somewhat asham'd for having attended my Friend on such an Errand  I WAS told afterwards that  Alcheic  's Choice of  Gulki  was very much approv'd of by all the good Company in Town and that 'twas expected while he gratify'd his own Passion he would perform to that young Man the same good Office which he had himself ow'd to  Elcouf  It seems  Alcheic  had been very handsome in his Youth and been courted by many Lovers but had bestow'd his Favours chiefly on the sage  Elcouf  to whom he was suppos'd to owe in a great Measure the astonishing Progress he had made in Philosophy and Virtue  IT gave me some Surprize that  Alcheic  's Wife who bythebye happen'd also to be his Sister was no way scandaliz'd at this Species of Infidelity  MUCH about the same Time I discover'd for it was not attempted to be kept a Secret from me or any Body that  Alcheic  was a Murderer and a Parricide and had put to Death an innocent Person the most nearly connected with him and whom he was oblig'd to protect and defend by all the Ties of Nature and Humanity When I ask'd with all the Caution and Deference imaginable what was his Motive for this Action he reply'd coolly that he was not then so much at his Ease as he is at present and that he had acted in that Particular by the Advice of all his Friends  HAVING heard  Alcheic  's Virtue so extremely celebrated I pretended to join in the general Voice of Acclamation and only ask'd by way of Curiosity as a Stranger which of all his noble Actions was most highly applauded and I soon found that all Sentiments were united in giving the Preference to the Assassination of  Usbek  This  Usbek  had been to the last Moment  Alcheic  's intimate Friend had lay'd many high Obligations upon him had even sav'd his Life on a certain Occasion and had by his Will which was found after the Murder made him his Heir to a considerable Part of his Fortune  Alcheic  it seems conspir'd with about twenty or thirty more most of them also  Usbek  's Friends and falling all  together on that unhappy Man when he was not aware they had tore him with a hundred Wounds and given him that Reward for all his past Favours and Obligations  Usbek  said the general Voice of the People had many great and good Qualities His very Vices were shining magnificent and generous But this Action of  Alcheic  sets him far above  Usbek  in the Eyes of all Judges of Merit and is one of the noblest that ever perhaps the Sun shone upon  ANOTHER Part of  Alcheic  's Conduct which I also found highly applauded was his Behaviour towards  Calish  with whom he was join'd in a Project or Undertaking of some Importance  Calish  being a passionate Man gave  Alcheic  one Day a sound Drubbing which he took very patiently waited the Return of  Calish  's good Humour kept still a fair Correspondence with him and by that Means brought the Affair in which they were join'd to a happy Issue and gain'd himself immortal Honour by his remarkable Temper and Moderation  I HAVE lately receiv'd a Letter from a Correspondent in  Fourli  by which I learn that since my Departure  Alcheic  falling into a bad State of Health has fairly hang'd himself and has dy'd universally regreted and applauded by every one in that Country So virtuous and noble a Life says each  Fourlian  could not be better crown'd than by so noble an End and he has prov'd by this as well as by all his other Actions what was his constant Principle during his Life and what he boasted of near his last Moments that a wise Man is scarce inferior to the great God  Vitzli  This is the Name of the Supreme Deity amongst the  Fourlians  THE Notions of this People continu'd  Palamedes  are as extraordinary with regard to Goodmanners and Sociableness as with regard to Morals My Friend  Alcheic  form'd once a Party for my Entertainment compos'd of all the prime Wits and Philosophers of  Fourli  and each of us brought his Mess along with him to the Place where we assembled I observ'd one of them to be worse provided than the rest and offer'd him a Share of mine which happen'd to be a roasted Pullet And I could not but remark that he and all the rest of the Company star'd at my Simplicity I was told that  Alcheic  had once so much Interest with his Club as to prevail with them to eat in common and that he had made use of an Artifice to that Purpose He persuaded those whom he observ'd to be  worst  provided to offer their Mess to the Company after which the others who had brought more delicate Fare were asham'd not to make the same Offer This is regarded as so extraordinary a Event that it has since as I  learn been recorded in the History of  Alcheic  's Life compos'd by one of the greatest Geniuses of  Fourli  PRAY says I  Palamedes  when you was at  Fourli  did you also learn the Art of turning your Friends into Ridicule by telling them strange Stories and then laughing at them if they believ'd you I assure you reply'd he that had I been dispos'd to learn such a Lesson there was no Place in the World more proper My Friend so often mention'd did nothing from Morning to Night but sneer and banter and railly and you could scarce ever distinguish whether he was in Jest or Earnest But you think then that my Story is improbable and that I have us'd or rather abus'd the Privilege of a Traveller To be sure says I you was but in Jest Such barbarous and savage Manners are not only incompatible with a civiliz'd intelligent People such as you said these were but are scarce compatible with human Nature They exceed all we ever read of amongst the  Mingrelians  and  Topinamboues  HAVE a care cry'd he have a care You are not aware you are speaking Blasphemy and are abusing your Favourites the  Greeks  especially the  Athenians  whom I have couch'd all along under these bizarre Names I employ'd If you consider aright there is not one Stroke of the foregoing  Character which might not be fo  nd in the Man of highest Merit at  Athens  without diminishing in the least from the Brightness of his Character The  Greek  Love their Marriages  The Laws of  Athens  allow'd a Man to marry his Sister by the Father  Solon  's Laws forbid Paederasty to Slaves as being of too great Dignity for such mean Persons  and the exposing of their Children cannot but strike you immediately The Death of  Usbek  is an exact Counterpart to that of  Caesar  ALL to a Trifle say'd I interrupting him you did not mention that  Usbek  was an Usurper  I DID not reply'd he lest you should discover the Parallel I aim'd at But even adding this Circumstance we should make no Scruple according to our Sentiments of Morals to denomitate  Brutus  and  Cassius  ungrateful Traitors and Assassins Tho' you know that they are perhaps the highest Characters of all Antiquity and the  Athenians  erected Statues to them which they plac'd near those of  Harmodius  and  Aristogiton  their own Deliverers And if you think this Circumstance you mention so material to absolve these Patriots I shall compensate it by another not mention'd which will equally aggravate their Crime A few Days before the Execution  of their fatal Purpose they all swore Fealty to  Caesar  and protesting to hold his Person ever sacred they touch'd the Altar with those Hands which they had already arm'd for his Destruction  Appian Bell Civ Lib Suetonius in vita Caesaris    I NEED not put you in mind of the famous and applauded Story of  Themistocles  and of his Patience towards  Eurybiades  the  Spartan  his commanding Officer who heated by a Debate lifted his Cane to him in a Council of War the same Thing as if he had cudgel'd him  Strike  Cries the  Athenian Strike but hear me  YOU are too good a Scholar not to discover  Socrates  and his  Athenian  Club in my last Story and you would certainly observe that it is exactly copy'd from  Xenophon  with a Variation only of the Names  Mem Soc Lib sub fine  And I think I have fairly made appear that an  Athenian  Man of Merit might be such a one as with us would pass for Incestuous a Parricide an Assassin an ungrateful perjur'd Traitor and something else too abominable to be nam'd not to mention his Rusticity and Illmanners And having liv'd in this Manner his Death may be entirely suitable He  may conclude the Scene by a desperate Act of Selfmurder and dye with the most absurd Blasphemies in his Mouth And notwithstanding all this he shall have Statues if not Altars erected to his Memory Poems and Orations shall be compos'd in his Praise great Sects shall be proud of calling themselves by his Name and the most distant Posterity shall blindly continue their Admiration Tho' were such a one to arise amongst themselves they would justly regard him with Horror and Execration  I MIGHT have been aware reply'd I of your Artifice You seem to take Pleasure in this Topic and are indeed the only Man I ever knew who was well acquainted with the Antients and did not extremely admire them But instead of attacking their Philosophy their Eloquence or Poetry the usual Subjects of Controversy betwixt us you now seem to impeach their Morals and accuse them of Ignorance in a Science which is the only one in my Opinion wherein they are not surpass'd by the Moderns Geometry Physics Astronomy Anatomy Botany Geography Navigation in these we justly claim the Superiority But what have we to oppose to their Moralists Your Representation of Things is fallacious You have no Indulgence for the Manners and Customs of different Ages Would you try  a  Greek  or  Roman  by the Commonlaw of  England  Hear him defend himself by his own Maxims and then pronounce  THERE are no Manners so innocent or reasonable which may not be render'd odious or ridiculous if measur'd by a Standard unknown to the Persons especially if you employ a little Art or Eloquence in aggravating some Circumstances and extenuating others as best serves the Purpose of your Discourse All these Artifices may easily be retorted on you Could I inform the  Athenians  for Instance there was a Nation wherein Adultery both active and passive so to speak was in the highest Vogue and Esteem Wherein every Man of Education chose for his Mistress a marry'd Woman the Wife perhaps of his Friend and Companion and valu'd himself upon these infamous Conquests as much as if he had been several Times a Conqueror in Boxing or Wrestling at the  Olympic  Games Wherein every Man also took a Pride in his Tameness and Facility with regard to his own Wife and was glad to make Friends or gain Interest by allowing her to prostitute her Charms and even without any such Motive gave her full Liberty and Indulgence I ask what Sentiments the  Athenians  would entertain of such a People they who never mention'd the Crime of Adultery but in Conjunction with Robbery and Poisoning  Which would they admire most the Villainy or the Meanness of such a Conduct  SHOULD I add that the same People were as proud of their Slavery and Dependance as the  Athenians  were of their Liberty and tho' a Man among them were opprest disgrac'd impoverish'd insulted or imprison'd by the Tyrant he would still regard it as the highest Merit to love serve and obey him and even to die for his smallest Glory or Satisfaction These noble  Greeks  would probably ask me whether I spoke of a human Society or of some inferior servile Species  'TWAS then I might inform my  Athenian  Audience that these People however wanted not Spirit and Bravery If a Man says I tho' their intimate Friend should throw out in a private Company a Raillery against them nearly approaching any of those with which your Generals and Demagogues every Day regale each other in the Face of the whole City they never can forgive him but in order to revenge themselves they oblige him immediately to run them thro' the Body or be himself murder'd And if a Man who is an absolute Stranger to them should desire them at the Peril of their own Life to cut the Throat of their Bosomcompanion▪ they immediately obey and think themselves  highly oblig'd and honour'd by the Commission These are their Maxims of Honour This is their favourite Morality  BUT tho' so ready to draw their Sword against their Friends and Countrymen no Disgrace no Infamy no Pain no Poverty will ever engage these People to turn the Point of it against their own Breast A Man of Rank would row in the Gallies would beg his Bread would languish in Prison would suffer any Tortures and still preserve his wretched Life Rather than escape his Enemies by a generous Contempt of Death he would infamously receive the same Death from his Enemies aggravated by their triumphant Insults and by the most exquisite Sufferings  'TIS very usual too continu'd I amongst this People to shut up several of their Children in a perpetual Prison where every Art of plaguing and tormenting them is carefully study'd and practis'd in order that another Child whom they own to have no greater or rather less Merit than the rest may enjoy their whole Fortune and wallow in every Kind of Voluptuousness and Pleasure Nothing so virtuous in their Opinion as this barbarous Partiality  BUT what is more particular in this whimsical Nation say I to the  Athenians  is that a Frolic of yours during the  Saturnalia  The  Greeks  kept the Feast of  Saturn  or  Chronus  as well as the  Romans  See Lucian Epist Saturn  when the Slaves are serv'd by their Masters is seriously continu'd by them thro' the whole Year and thro' the whole Course of their Lives and accompany'd too with some Circumstances which still farther augment the Absurdity and Ridicule Your Sport only elevates for a few Days those whom Fortune has thrown down and whom she too in Sport may really elevate for ever above you But this Nation gravely exalt those whom Nature has subjected to them and whose Inferiority and Infirmities are absolutely incurable The Women tho' without Virtue are their Masters and Sovereigns These they reverence praise and magnify To these they pay the highest Deference and Respect And in all Places and at all Times the Superiority of the Females is readily acknowledg'd and submitted to by every one who has the least Pretensions to Education and Politeness Scarce any Crime would be so universally detested as an Infraction of this Rule  YOU need go no farther reply'd  Palamedes  I can easily conjecture the People you aim at The Strokes with which you have painted them are pretty just and yet you must acknowledge that scarce any People are to be found either in antient or modern Times whose national Character is upon the Whole less liable to Exceptions But I give you Thanks for helping me our with my Argument I had no Intention of exalting the Moderns at the Expence of the Antients I only meant to represent the Uncertainty of all these Judgments concerning Characters and to convince you that Fashion Vogue Custom and Law were the chief Foundation of all moral Determinations The  Athenians  surely were a civiliz'd intelligent People if ever there was one and yet their Man of Merit might in this Age be held in Horror and Execration The  French  are also without doubt a very civiliz'd intelligent People and yet their Man of Merit might with the  Athenians  be an Object of the highest Contempt and Ridicule and even Hatred And what renders the Matter more extraordinary These two national Characters are suppos'd to be the most similar of any in antient or modern Times and while the  English  flatter themselves that they resemble the  Romans  their Neighbours on the Continent draw the Parallel betwixt themselves and these polite  Greeks  What  wide Difference therefore in the Sentiments of Morals must be found betwixt civiliz'd Nations and Barbarians or betwixt Nations whose Characters have little in common How shall we pretend to fix a Standard for Judgments of this Nature  BY tracing Matters reply'd I a little higher and examining the first Principles which each Nation establishes of Blame or Censure The  Rhine  flows North the  Rhone  South yet both spring from the  same  Mountain and are also actuated in their opposite Directions by the  same  Principle of Gravity The different Inclinations of the Ground on which they run cause all the Difference of their Courses  IN how many Circumstances would an  Athenian  and  French  Man of Merit certainly concur Goodsense Knowledge Wit Eloquence Humanity Fidelity Truth Justice Courage Temperance Constancy Dignity of Mind These you have all omitted in order to insist only on the Points in which they may by Accident differ Very well I am willing to comply with you and shall endeavour to account for these Differences from the most universal establish'd Principles of Morals  THE  Greek  Loves I care not to examine more particularly I shall only observe that however blameable  they arose from a very innocent Cause the Frequency of the Gymnastic Exercises amongst that People and were recommended tho' absurdly as the Source of Friendship Sympathy mutual Attachment and Fidelity  Plat Symp P Ex Edit Serr  Qualities esteem'd in all Nations and all Ages  THE Marriage of Halfbrothers and Sisters seems no great Difficulty Love betwixt the nearer Relations is contrary to Reason and public Utility but the precise Point where we are to stop can scarcely be determin'd by natural Reason and is therefore a very proper Subject of municipal Law or Custom If the  Athenians  went a little too far on the one Side the Canon Law has surely push'd Matters a great way into the other Extremity  See Enquiry Sect IV    HAD you ask'd a Parent at  Athens  why he bereav'd his Child of that Life which he had so lately given it 'Tis because I love it he would reply and regard the Poverty it must inherit from me as a greater Evil than a Death which it is not capable of dreading feeling or resenting  Plutarch de amore prolis sub fine    HOW is public Liberty the most valuable of all Blessings to be recover'd from the Hands of an  Usurper or Tyrant if his Power shields him from public Rebellion and our Scruples from private Vengeance That his Crime is capital by Law you acknowledge And must the highest Aggravation of his Crime the putting himself above Law form his full Security You can reply nothing but by showing the great Inconveniencies of Assassination which could any one have prov'd clearly to the Antients he had reform'd their Sentiments in this Particular  AGAIN to cast your Eye on the Picture I have drawn of modern Manners there is almost as great Difficulty I acknowledge to justify  French  as  Greek  Gallantry except only that the former is much more natural and agreeable than the latter But our Neighbours it seems have resolv'd to sacrifice some of the domestic to the sociable Pleasures and to prefer Ease Freedom and an open Commerce to a strict Fidelity and Constancy These Ends are both good and are somewhat difficult to reconcile nor need we be surpriz'd if the Customs of Nations encline too much sometimes to the one Side sometimes to the other  THE most inviolable Attachment to the Laws of our Country is everywhere acknowledg'd a capital Virtue and where the People are not so happy as  to have any other Legislature but a single Person the strictest Loyalty is in that Case the truest Patriotism  NOTHING surely can be more absurd and barbarous than the Practice of Duelling but those who justify it say that it begets Civility and Goodmanners And a Duelist you may observe always values himself upon his Courage his Sense of Honour his Fidelity and Friendship Qualities which are here indeed very oddly directed but have been esteem'd universally since the Foundation of the World  HAVE the Gods forbid Selfmurder An  Athenian  allows that it ought to be foreborn Has the Deity permitted it A  Frenchman  allows that Death is preferable to Pain and Infamy  YOU see then continu'd I that the Principles upon which Men reason in Morals are always the same tho' the Conclusions they draw are often very different That they all reason aright with regard to this Subject more than with regard to any other it is not incumbent on any Moralist to show 'Tis sufficient that the original Principles of Censure or Blame are uniform and that erroneus Conclusions can be corrected by sounder Reasonings and a larger  Experience As many Ages as have elaps'd since the Fall of  Greece  and  Rome  and such Changes as have arriv'd in Religion Language Laws and Customs none of these Revolutions has ever produc'd any considerable Innovation in the primary Sentiments of Morals more than in those of external Beauty Some minute Differences perhaps may be observ'd in both  Horace  Epist Lib Epist Also Lib Ode  celebrates a low Forehead and  Anacreon  join'd Eyebrows  Ode Petronius Cap joins both these Circumstances as Beauties  But the  Apollo  and the  Venus  of Antiquity are still our Models for Male and Female Beauty in like Manner as the Character of  Scipio  continues our Standard for the Glory of Heroes and that of  Cornelia  for the Honour of Matrons  IT appears that there never was any Quality recommended by any one as a Virtue or moral Excellence but on account of its being  useful  or  agreeable  to a Man  himself  or to  others  For what other Reason can there ever be for Praise or Approbation Or where would be the Sense of extolling  good  Character of Action which at the same Time is allow'd to be  good for nothing  All the Differences therefore in Morals may be reduc'd to this  one general Foundation and may be accounted for by the different Views which People take of these Circumstances  SOMETIMES Men differ in their Judgment about the Usefulness of any Habit or Action Sometimes also the peculiar Circumstances of Things render one moral Quality more useful than others and give it a peculiar Preference  'TIS not surprising that during a Period of War and Disorder the military Virtues should be more celebrated than the pacific and attract more the Admiration and Attention of Mankind  "How usual is it"  says  Tully  Tuse Quaest Lib    "to find  Cimbrians Celtiberians  and other Barbarians who bear with inflexible Constancy all the Fatigues and Dangers of the Field but are immediately dispirited under the Suffrance and Hazard of a languishing Distemper While on the other hand▪ the  Grecks  patiently endure the slow Approaches of Death when arm'd with Sickness and Disease but timorously fly his Presence when he attacks them violently with Swords and Falchions"  So opposite is even the same Virtue of Courage amongst warlike or peaceful Nations And indeed we may  observe that as the Difference betwixt War and Peace is the greatest that arises among Nations and public Societies it produces also the greatest Variations in moral Sentiment and diversifies the most our Idea of Virtue and personal Merit  SOMETIMES too Magnanimity Greatness of Mind Disdain of Slavery inflexible Rigour and Integrity may suit better the Circumstances of one Age than those of another and have a more kindly Influence both on public Affairs and on a Man's own Safety and Advancement Our Idea of Merit therefore will also vary a little with these Variations and  Labeo  perhaps be censur'd for the same Qualities which procur'd  Cato  the highest Approbation  A DEGREE of Luxury may be ruinous and pernicious in a Native of  Switzerland  which only fosters the Arts and encourages Industry in a  Frenchman  or  Englishman  We are not therefore to expect either the same Sentiment or the same Laws in  Berne  that prevail in  London  or  Paris  DIFFERENT Customs have also some Influence as well as different Utilities and by giving an early Biass to the Mind may produce a superior Propensity either to the useful or the agreeable Qualities to  those which regard Self or those which extend to Society These four Sources of moral Sentiment still subsist but particular Accidents may at one Time make one of them flow with greater Abundance than at another  THE Customs of some Nations shut up the Women from all social Commerce Those of others make them so essential a Part of Society and Conversation that except where Business is canvass'd the Malesex alone are suppos'd absolutely incapable of mutual Discourse and Entertainment As this Difference is the most material that can happen in private Life it must also produce the greatest Variation in our moral Sentiments  OF all Nations in the World where Polygamy was not allow'd the  Greeks  seem to have been the most reserv'd in their Commerce with the Fairsex and to have impos'd on them the strictest Laws of Modesty and Decency We have a strong Instance of this in an Oration of  Lysias  Orat  A Widow injur'd ruin'd undone calls a Meeting of a few of her nearest Friends and Relations and tho' never before accustom'd says the Orator to speak in the Presence of Men the Distress of her Circumstances constrain'd  her to lay the Case before them Her very Opening her Mouth in such Company requir'd it seems an Apology  WHEN  Demosthenes  prosecuted his Tutors to make them refund his Patrimony it became necessary for him in the Course of the Law suit to prove that the Marriage of  Aphobus  's Sister with  Oneter  was entirely fraudulent and that notwithstanding her Shammarriage she had liv'd with her Brother at  Athens  for two Years last past ever since her Divorce from her former Husband And 'tis remarkable that tho' these were People of the first Fortune and Distinction in the City the Orator could prove this Fact no Way but by calling for her female Slaves to be put to the Question and by the Evidence of one Physician who had seen her in her Brother's House during her Illness  In Oneterem  So reserv'd were  Greek  Manners  WE may be certain that an extreme Purity was the Consequence of this Reserve Accordingly we find that except the fabulous Stories of an  Helen  and a  Clytemnestra  there scarce is an Instance of any Event in the  Greek  History that proceeded from the Intrigues of Women On the other hand in modern  Times particularly in a neighbouring Nation the Females enter into all Transactions and all Management of Church and State and no Man can succeed who takes not care to obtain their good Graces  Harry  the third by incurring the Displeasure of the Fair endanger'd his Crown and lost his Life as much as by his Indulgence to Heresy  'TIS needless to dissemble The Consequence of a very free Commerce betwixt the Sexes and of their living much together will often terminate in Intrigues and Gallantry We must sacrifice somewhat of the  useful  if we be very anxious to obtain all the  agreeable  Qualities and cannot pretend to reach alike every Kind of Advantage Instances of Licence daily multiplying will weaken the Scandal with the one Sex and teach the other by Degrees to adopt the famous Maxim of  la Fontaine  with regard to female Infidelity  that if one knows it it is but a small Matter if one knows it not it is nothing  Quand on le sçait c'est peu de chose  Quand on ne le sçait pas ce n'est rien    SOME People are inclin'd to think that the best Way of adjusting all Differences and of keeping the proper Medium betwixt the  agreeable  and  useful  Qualities of the Sex is to live with them after the  Manner of the  Romans  and the  English  for the Customs of these two Nations seem similar in this Respect  During the Time of the Emperors the  Romans  seem to have been more given to Intrigues and Gallantry than the  English  are at present And the Women of Condition in order to retain their Lovers endeavour'd to fix a Name of Reproach on those who were addicted to Wenching and low Amours They were call'd  Ancillarioli  See Seneca de Beneficiis Lib Cap See also Martial Lib Epig  that is without Gallantry  The Gallantry here meant is that of Amours and Attachments not that of Complaisance which is as much pay'd to the fair Sex in  England  as in any other Country  and without Jealousy By a Parity of Reason the Customs of the  Spaniards  and of the  Italians  of an Age ago for the present are very different must be the worst of any because they favour both Gallantry and Jealousy  NOR will these different Customs of Nations affect only the one Sex The Idea of personal Merit in the Males must also be somewhat different with regard at least to Conversation Address and Humour The one Nation where the Men live much apart will naturally more esteem Prudence the other Gaiety With the one Simplicity of Manners will be in the highest Respect with the other Politeness The one will distinguish themselves by  Goodsense and Judgment the other by Taste and Delicacy The Eloquence of the former will shine most in the Senate that of the other on the Theatre  THESE I say are the  natural  Effects of such Customs For it must be confest that Chance has a great Influence on national Manners and many Events happen in Society which are not to be accounted for by general Rules Who could imagine for Instance that the  Romans  who liv'd freely with their Women should be very indifferent about Music and esteem Dancing infamous While the  Greeks  who never almost saw a Woman but in their own Houses were continually piping singing and dancing  THE Differences of moral Sentiment which naturally arise from a republican or monarchical Government are also very obvious as well as those which proceed from general Riches or Poverty Union or Faction Ignorance or Learning I shall conclude this long Discourse with observing that different Customs and Situations vary the original Ideas of Merit however they may some Consequences in no very essential Point and prevail chiefly with regard to young Men who can aspire  to the agreeable Qualities and may attempt to please The MANNER the ORNAMENTS the GRACES that succeed in this Shape are more arbitrary and casual But the Merit of riper Years is almost everywhere the same and consists chiefly in Integrity Humanity Ability Knowledge and the other more solid and useful Qualities of the human Mind  WHAT you insist on reply'd  Palamedes  may have some Foundation when you stick to the Maxims of common Life and ordinary Conduct Experience and the Practice of the World readily correct any great Extravagance on either Side But what say you to  artificial  Lives and Manners How do you reconcile the Maxims on which these are founded  WHAT do you understand by  artificial  Lives and Manners said I I explain myself reply'd he You know that Religion had in antient Times' very little Influence on common Life and that after Men had perform'd their Duty in Sacrifices and Prayers at the Temple they thought that the Gods left the rest of their Conduct to themselves and were little pleas'd or offended with those Virtues and Vices that only affected the Peace and Happiness of human Society In those Ages 'twas the Business of Philosophy alone to regulate Men's ordinary Behaviour  and Deportment and accordingly we may observe that this being the sole Principle by which a Man could elevate himself above his Fellows it acquir'd a mighty Ascendant over many and produc'd great Singularities of Maxims and of Conduct At present that Philosophy has lost the Allurement of Novelty it has no such extensive Influence but seems to confine itself mostly to Speculations in the Closet in the same Manner as the antient Religion was limited to Sacrifices in the Temple Its Place is now supply'd by the modern Religion which inspects our whole Conduct and prescribes an universal Rule to our Actions to our Words to our very Thoughts and Inclinations a Rule so much the more austere that it is guarded by infinite tho' distant Rewards and Punishments and no Infraction of it can ever be conceal'd or disguis'd  DIOGENES  is the most celebrated Model of extravagant Philosophy Let us seek a Parallel to him in modern Times We shall not disgrace any philosophic Name by a Comparison with the  Dominics  or  Loyolas  or any canoniz'd Monk or Friar Let us compare him to  Pascal  a Man of Parts and Genius as well as  Diogenes  himself and perhaps too  a Man of Virtue had he allow'd his virtuous Inclinations to have exerted and display'd themselves  THE Foundation of  Diogenes  's Conduct was to render himself an independent Being as much as possible and to confine all his Wants and Desires and Pleasures within himself and his own Mind The Aim of  Pascal  was to keep a perpetual Sense of his Dependance before his Eyes and never to forget his numberless Wants and Necessities The Antient supported himself by Magnanimity Ostentation Pride and the Idea of his own Superiority above his Fellowcreatures The Modern made constant Profession of Humility and Abasement of the Contempt and Hatred of himself and endeavour'd to attain these suppos'd Virtues as far as they are attainable The Austerities of the  Greek  were in order to inure himself to Hardships and prevent his ever suffering Those of the  Frenchman  were embrac'd merely for their own Sake and in order to suffer as much as possible The Philosopher indulg'd himself in the most beastly Pleasures even in public The Saint refus'd himself the most innocent even in private The former thought it his Duty to love his Friends and to rail at them and reprove them and scold them The latter endeavour'd to be absolutely indifferent towards his nearest Relations and to love and speak well of his Enemies The great Object  of  Diogenes  's Wit was every Kind of Superstition that is every Kind of Religion known in his Time The Mortality of the Soul was his Standard Principle and even his Sentiments of a Divine Providence seem to have been very licentious The most ridiculous Superstitions directed  Pascal  's Faith and Practice and an extreme Contempt of this Life in Comparison of the future was the chief Foundation of his Conduct  IN such a remarkable Contrast do these two Men stand Yet both of them have met with universal Admiration in their different Ages and have been propos'd as Models of Imitation Where then is the universal Standard of Morals which you talk of And what Rule shall we establish for the many different nay contrary Sentiments of Mankind  AN Experiment said I that succeeds in the Air will not always succeed in a Vacuum When Men depart from the Maxims of common Reason and affect these  artificial  Lives as you call them noone can answer for what will please or displease them They are in a different Element from the rest of Mankind and the natural Principles of their Mind play not with the same Regularity as if left to themselves free from the Illusions of religious Superstition or
