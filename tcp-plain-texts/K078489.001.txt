 LEARNING AT A LOSS OR THE AMOURS OF MR PEDANT and MISS HARTLEY  VOL I  LEARNING AT A LOSS OR THE AMOURS OF MR PEDANT and MISS HARTLEY  A NOVEL  IN TWO VOLUMES  VOLUME THE FIRST  Qui Studiis annos

Strand and J BEW PaternosterRow  MDCCLXXVIII  DEDICATION PREFACE c TO ALL THE CIRCULATING LIBRARIANS In the Kingdom of GREATBRITAIN  HAVING now finished my first Volume for I consider it as a great Piece of Folly or Presumption or perhaps both to prepare an elaborate Preface for a Work absolutely Nonexistent inasmuch as it implies a Man's being perfectly satisfied with his own Capability of Writing something worth Publishing for if it should not be worth publishing a  Preface to it would certainly be needless and likewise as it is contrary to the received and established Custom of Mankind in most other Matters which if I thought fit I could prove by a Variety of Instances Having finished my first Volume I say then and if  Horace  's Doctrine of  "Dimidium facti qui Cepit habet"  that is "He who has begun has half done" be true I who have actually got through the  Dimidium  or half of my Work may by a Parity of Reasoning and according to the Rule of Proportions be very fairly said to have completed it entirely I begin to think fit that it should be embellished with some Sort of Prefatory Introductory Dedicatory Discourse and not having  much Time to spare at present I design the following Pages shall answer any or all of these several Ends according as I shall find it convenient As for the Dedicatees or People to be dedicated to having maturely deliberated on that Matter I deem it most proper to address myself with the utmost Gratitude to my very generous Friends and Benefactors as I hope they will be the Circulating Librarians of this Kingdom paying them in advance which I think ought to weigh something with them my unfeigned Thanks for their very vigorous and spirited Exertions in promoting the extensive Sale of this little Production and at the same Time humbly intreating them if they should find  no farther mention of their very respectable Selves in the Course of this Literary Midwife of mine which like other Midwives has more necessary Matters than Compliments to attend to that they will not give way to the Instigations of a wrathful Effervescence but will content themselves like good Tradesmen with the promissory Note of an Author which I here give them my Honour shall be found payable at Sight in the Conclusion with all due Ceremonies of dedicatory Reverence the foregoing Sentences no ways impeding or hindering the same  And now it may perhaps be expected that I should give some concise Account of the general Plan and Fable of my Book together  with the Reasons that first induced me to set about it not forgetting a Variety of pretty Apologies for the Inaccuracy of the Stile and Infinity of other Defects which it may be supposed to abound with which however it is hoped will be all passed over as the Author composed it entirely in the Course of three Weeks  "Stans Pede in Uno"  or when he was on a Journey or when he was hardly recovered from a severe Fit of Illness and the like And Pleas of this Sort I well know are considered by many Authors as a sufficient Excuse for the utmost Ebullitions of Folly as if writing Nonsense with Facility was any great Merit nay so perfectly are their Minds satisfied with this Salvo that should the  discriminating Stomach of the Public find any accidental Nausea in swallowing the Bolus after it has been daubed with this apologetical Gilding they do not scruple to anathematize them altogether as the most illiterate illiberal undiscerning Blockheads that ever existed Now in my Opinion all this aggravates the Fault instead of palliating it nor can I possibly conceive more than one Case or Situation where these Arguments can be valid or admissible and that is the  Compulsio ex Paupertate  Anglicè when a Man is a good deal behind Hand in the World and is afraid of being troubled by his Landlord And this not happening to be my Case at present for I paid up to the End of my Quarter but  Thursday  was Se'nnight last past I entirely lose the Benefit of the Exception and am absolutely under an Obligation to write both Sense and Grammar according to my own Dogma "Well but as to the Plot and Characters of the Novel some Sketch of these will be very proper and necessary and will doubtless be generally expected" I shall certainly be thought a very rude Fellow when I declare that if this is the Case I am heartily sorry for it inasmuch as all this general Expectation will doubtless be disappointed Any Thing that bears the Appearance of a Chapter of Contents I utterly explode and for very substantial Reasons too which Reasons are not substantial merely because I chuse to think them so  but are really and in themselves  Seipsis  Reasons good and substantial as I will presently prove all the Rules of  Aristotle  and the Ancients with their Prologusses and Chorusses and Protasisses c c notwithstanding  In their Dramatic Exhibitions and TheatresRoyal indeed presupposing that their Regulations concerning Boxkeepers and no Money to be returned after the Curtain is drawn up were the same as ours all these Pieces of Information might do well enough perhaps for the Five Shillings being once paid it signified little to the Author or Manager though it might contribute somewhat to increase the  Ennui  of the Auditor whether one was let into the Plot  of something exceedingly stupid plumpall at once or was left to fish it out by Degrees as the Play proceeded  Gradatim et Pedetentim  But in the Case of a modern Novel it is widely different For supposing that is explained in the Preface Miss sends for it after Breakfast skims the six or eight first Pages without cutting open the Leaves and if from Want of Taste or Discernment for we cannot suppose the Author in fault she happens to dislike either all the Characters or any one of them the general Plan of the Whole the Beginning the Middle or the Catastrophe it is returned immediately to her Bookseller with the verbal Satisfaction arising from her informing him that  She was  very sorry for the Trouble she had given him but that her Servant had made a Mistake that it was the wrong Book 'twas not the Book she wanted  or the like futile Apology and there is so much clear Loss out of the Author's and Bookseller's Pocket Now if on the other Hand she is obliged to read the Book through to come at the Contents of it she must cut open the Leaves if she cuts open the Leaves she is obliged to pay for the Book and if she is obliged to pay for the Book there is so much clear gain into the Author's and Bookseller's Pocket Besides she will then find Entertainment in it for the Goad of Curiosity which in the other Case is entirely taken away now acting upon her every  Thing is seen through a different Medium Dense Sayings become rare dull brilliant and she now gets thro' with the utmost Satisfaction what would otherwise have seemed as tiresome and fatiguing had she been condemned to read it as lulling her Father to sleep with the Psalms and Lessons on a Sunday Evening  All I shall say therefore is that I take Characters as I find them so that if there are any Objections made on that Score as that they are unnatural disagreeable or the like the Charge will all lie at their own Doors and I being but an humble Copier wash my Hands of it Thus much however I freely declare to avoid the Grumblings and Illwill of such as estimate  the Value of a Novel by the Number of Peers and Countesses it contains that from the Beginning to the End of my Book they will find neither a Duke of B nor a Marquis of C nor D nor any one Member of the Upperhouse whatsoever no not even in Disguise A mere simple Baronet or two and those but odd ones are my most dignified Male Characters and as to my Females they are all  Common  Neither do I think I have any Thing exactly adapted to the Palates of those bloodthirsty Gentlewomen who delight in Duels between Lovers and shooting Highwaymen and the like Sorts of Entertainment for though we have one Military Man amongst us he  is not particularly attached to such barbarous Pastimes owing perhaps to the Scenes of Slaughter he has been present at in  America  which he has quitted but just Time enough to give me a little Assistance I feel indeed and surely I may be permitted to flatter myself that in this Affair at least I can see as far into Futurity as any other blind  Tiresias  a certain unaccountable  Presentiment  that some of my Characters being naturally turbulent will fall out and quarrel amongst themselves before I have done with them in spite of all my Endeavours to the contrary Lest this should be the Case however I here beg Leave to premise as before in the Article of Disagreeableness that it is all their  own doing and if the Consequences by any Accident should be sanguinary it will be entirely for their own Amusement and Satisfaction For my Part I am too much of a Christian not to join in the Litany with the utmost Fervour and Sincerity for Deliverance  from all Battle and Murder and from sudden Death  As to my Sentimental Readers if any such there should be for them indeed I have procured a very valuable curious and interesting Manuscript It was given me by an intimate Friend of mine who met with it by Accident and though it is written by no higher Character than a Lady's Maid I think I may venture to pronounce it very far from contemptible I  declare moreover as an additional Gratification that if any Person or Persons of this Stamp should perceive their Patience fail them in coming at it in the regular Course of Reading I will save such the Trouble of spitting on their Thumbs to turn the Leaves over by informing them that it is to be found somewhere towards the latter End of this first Volume I forget exactly the Number of the Page And now having given People in general as much Satisfaction as I think proper I mean to fill the Remainder of my Preface with a Dissertation on a Greek Verb and a Compound Pronoun    Nosce Teipsum  or Know Thyself as it has been differently rendered in the different  Languages was the Saying of an old  Grecian  Philosopher whose Name I know nothing about Now though that Maxim might be a very good one and highly serviceable in those Days when it was the Fashion for Men to run away from their Relations lose themselves in some great Wood of Science I mean and letting their Beards grow commence Brutes or Philosophers or sometimes both just as it happened yet I cannot help entertaining a very different Opinion of its Excellency when applied to our present System of Things I presume it is granted that nothing is more fickle than Fashion or more subject to an infinite Variety of Changes That at one Time we  see every Body with Waists as high as their Armpits and Skirts hanging as long and as aukwardly from the Shoulder "as an old Lady's loose Gown" By and by the Waist is dropt to the Kneeband and the Skirts and Pockets look like those of a Town Footman's Powdering Jacket or the Remains of a tall Rogue's Thieving Coat that had left eight or ten Inches of its length in a NurseryMan's SteelTrap One Minute nobody can appear with a Button bigger than a drop Earring or the End of a young Toadstool the next nothing but Plates and Potlids go down and if some odd Fellow by Accident appears in a Suit of Cloaths fifty Years behind hand he is considered as absolutely  Antediluvian  and  Hottentottish  And is there not then a Fashion in quaint Sayings and pithy Apopthegms as well as in Dress Would not that be looked upon as gross Bawdry and an Affront to the Company where it was spoken in these chaste Days of original Purity which would have been considered as a very good Joke in  Charles  the Second's Time even for a Maid of Honour to have laughed at And this being the Case can any thing be more absurd and ridiculous than to see Men nowadays following that old Piece of Advice of two or three Thousand Years standing lock themselves up in their Libraries for in the Woods they would probably be exposed to the Exercise of being hunted at present or might be passed to their  Parishes or sent to the House of Correction as Vagrants or sentenced to Ballastheaving as Thieves or to Bedlam as Madmen or to  Brooks's  in the  HayMarket  as PorcupineMen or fifty other Accidents might happen which would burst the Barriers of my Parenthesis if I attempted to insert them and taking the  Nosce Teipsum  in an exclusive Sense determine to know nobody  but  themselves so that if their Ceiling happens to fall in or they are burnt out of their Laboratory or any extraordinary Event of that Sort drives them into the World they stare about them and start and run to hide themselves in the first Hole they can meet with like a Spider that's poked out of his Cobweb Besides if  they are so obstinately bigotted to this old Saying let them follow it according to the new Translation which is still highly fashionable and is now generally believed to be the right one All the Grammars that I ever read conjugate the first Person singular of Verbs Active in the following Manner Let us suppose for Instance the Verb  KNOW  and let us suppose the old  Grecian  delivering his Precept to me with a grave Face and dirty Beard in English for I will not make any farther Display of my Greek and Latin Knowledge for fear of Puzzling my Readers  "Know Thyself"  I begin to conjugate having first turned my Eyes inwards a little to see whether his Advice was necessary Indicative Mood  first Person singular  I know am knowing or  and the Thing is done For add the Compound Pronoun  Myself addendo  I am knowing myself then transpose  transponendo  I myself am knowing  id est  I am keen I am deep I am a damned clever Fellow c c and here you have all the Advantage of the old  Grecian  's Advice and keep Company with People of Fashion into the Bargain  In those ancient Times indeed when Men never felt themselves Easy without two or three hundred Weight of Iron or Brass upon their Shoulders when their Fingers were always itching to cut one another's Throats for Diversion when their Kings and Generals were for ever vapouring and flourishing their  Swords about like a Parcel of Children insomuch that if we may believe  Homer  they would sometimes kill their own Butchersmeat to keep their Hands in When all this was the Case I say a quiet peaceable Man who would at any Time rather fall to sleep than to fighting might be much in the Right taking the Saying in its old Acceptation to run away and hide himself But in these Days of Tranquillity and Civilization when nothing of this Kind is to be feared when People generally take off their Swords before they sit down to Dinner when the Excellency of our  Police  is such that a Man may walk for a Fortnight together about the Streets and Roads of the Metropolis as safely as in his own  Bedchamber when our very Duels are all  amicably adjusted  and after a Flash in the Pan praise be to the Monk who first invented Gunpowder terminate to the  Satisfaction of all Parties  Surely when Things are in this Situation The best Way to avoid Illwill and Censure is to let every Reader form his own Judgment upon it  O Learning thou fair maturing Sun of Genius without whose fostering Influence it shoots and flourishes indeed but brings no Fruit to Perfection How is thy Cause injured by the churlish Bigotry of thy Professors How  much unmerited Contempt hath that Gloom of Literary Superstition brought on thee and on thy Doctrines How many promising Hopes and Expectations hath it suppressed and sunk for ever Like Religion thou art lovely and amiable Like Religion thou hast been perverted and Abused Thy Ways are Ways of Pleasantness and all thy Paths are Peace Thou comest as a Father to his Child not as a Tyrant to his Slave But thy Teachers have cloathed thee with Pride they have armed thee with all the Terrors of Persecution By thine Enemies thou never could'st be injured For the Pedantry of thine own Children thou art too often undeservedly despised  I am Gentlemen With the utmost Sincerity of Submission Your most accidentally Biographical Caricatureistical DatDicatDedicatorial Humble Servant Slave and Blackamoor To the Tune of as much Money As you think proper to give me for my Compliments The AUTHOR  Learning at a Loss  c  WILLIAM EASY  Esq  to  CHARLES MELMOTH  Esq  Temple  February  Just returned from Bath  ONCE more my Dear Friend I am seated in my Chambers  t the  Temple  surrounded as usual with a ridiculous Confusion of Litter and Literature my Chairs and Tables covered with Pamphlets and Powder and Dust and Lawbooks  and in short every Thing exactly as I left it six Weeks ago Well thought I as I cast my Eye round my Apartments a  Temple  Laundress is nothing but a new Edition of an University Bedmaker However there is some Satisfaction and Advantage in being able to leave one's Papers in what Corner of the Room one pleases without running the Risque of their being turned over and methodized with a Broom or a Duster  In the mean Time my Servant had shut up the Windows lighted the Fire and two half Candles that remained in the Sconces and retired and I throwing myself upon my Sopha tried I believe for near an hour to persuade myself that I had never been from Home But  finding Reality too strong for Imagination I began seriously to ruminate upon what had passed during the Interval My last Letter I think was written just before I set out on my Expedition to that Centre of Gaiety  Bath  and I have not heard from you these two Months Since then what Changes and Vicissitudes have I experienced In short that Day which like Death must sooner or later come upon all Men has overtaken me I am desperately in Love Not so bad indeed as to prevent or suspend the common Animal Operations of Eating Drinking and Sleeping nor yet so bad as to make me prefer a hard flinty Pavement to a good Featherbed No"My Wound" for you know People in Love are  always supposed to be wounded  is not so deep as a Well nor so wide as a Church Door but 'tis enough 'twill serve Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a Grave Man  And now for the Manner in which I received it I had hardly been at  Bath  three Days when as I was dropping into the Pumproom according to my Morning custom I saw a tall elegant Girl about eighteen or twenty supporting a miserable old Lump of Chalkstones who was drinking the Waters I will not attempt a Description of her as every Man is apt to deal in Hyperbole on these Occasions and talk of Orangeflower Breath and Pearls and Rubies as if he was thinking of the Trinkets that must  be bought if he married her till he turns his Mistress into a Greenhouse or a Jeweller's Shop with his Compliments However if you are very desirous of seeing her Picture drawn you may find one ready cut and dried and fit for use in most Novels In short she was  Fairer far than Painters form  Or youthful Poets fancy when they love  that is she pleased me and entirely came up to my Idea of Female Perfection As soon as the old Fellow was drenched sufficiently and had taken himself out of the Pumproom I enquired his Home c of the  Naiad  that attends there and in the Course of five Minute's Conversation was informed that he was a Mr  Hartley  that he had been at  Bath  about a Fortnight  that the young Lady was his Daughter and only Child that she was said to have a very large Fortune and finally was to be at the Ball next Evening A lucky Gleam of Recollection at this Instant reminded me that I had often heard my Father talk of him and that when a Child I had seen him at our House Upon the Strength of this paternal Acquaintance I determined to introduce myself and accordingly made my Appearance at his Door the next Morning about Breakfast Time I found the old Gentleman in his Nightcap and Slippers pothering over the Newspaper and his  Charmante fille  on the opposite Side of the Table pouring out the Tea Having seated myself by him both that I  might have a more advantageous View of my Goddess and that I might appear to pay him the greater Respect I began to explain who I was and having mentioned some Circumstances which I luckily remembered to have heard from my Father concerning their Acquaintance together the old Gentleman whipt off his Spectacles in an Instant and laying down his Paper first shook me heartily by the Hand and immediately afterwards resuming the former Part of his Apparatus stared me full in the Face for near a Minute to discover whether there was any Family Likeness He was fortunate enough to perceive a very strong one which was more than ever I have been able to do in my Life However  it served to increase his Civility to me and we soon became very intimate His Wife it seems has been dead several Years and he calls his own Age between Sixty and Seventy tho' the frequent Gouty Attacks he has undergone make him look older He talked over a vast Heap of Family Matters and seemed to consider me as an Acquaintance of twenty Years standing Thanks to my Father for it In the mean Time his Daughter was not idle I burnt my Mouth horribly with a scalding Dish of Tea she presented me from paying greater Attention to the Giver than the Gift She frequently joined in our Discourse and was full of Life and Vivacity You may suppose I exerted myself and as a  Reward for my Labour was happy enough before I left the House to obtain her own and her Father's Permission to dance with her that Evening Adieu my Servant has just brought in Supper which obliges me to defer the Sequel of my Adventures till another Post  Yours sincerely  W Easy  WILLIAM EASY  to  CHARLES MELMOTH  Temple  February  Dear Charles  MY last I think concluded with a Promise of some farther Account of my amatorial Proceedings I now sit down to fulfil that Promise and at the same Time to ask your Advice in regard to my future Measures Really I am very much in love with this Girl The more I think of her the more I admire her good Sense and Vivacity and though in Case of a Refusal I should neither shoot nor  drown yet if I ever am to marry most fervently do I pray that she may be the Person Books now are become quite a Bore to me And not merely Legal ones which you know I never received much Entertainment from but History Geography and even my Favourites the Poets seem insipid and fatiguing unless they treat of Love To return to my History According to Appointment I was made happy with Miss  Hartley  's Hand at the Ball and before she quitted  Bath  became perfectly intimate with her Father and I flatter myself not utterly disagreeable to herself He is really a very honest good sort of Being but like every body else has his Foible  which however is an innocent one and in some Degree hereditary His Father was a Man who to good natural Parts had added a considerable Fund of acquired Knowledge He seeing with the Eyes of a Parent unluckily supposes this Son possessed of the same Degree of the one and consequently determines he shall not be deficient in the other With this View he is sent to the University and both his Terms and Vacations employed in all the Perplexities of Science either with his Tutor or at Home By and by the old Man dies and the Son having always been taught to suppose himself clever takes his Father's Word for the Truth of it and  invitâ Minervâ  continues to this Day wandering in the self same Labyrinths and paying the most obsequious Respect to every Man he hears spoken of for Literary Eminence You may be assured I humoured this ridiculous Passion and routed out all my Stock of University Learning upon the Occasion Upon my Honour when I had rubbed it up a little I was surprized to find how it shone like a Piece of old Family Plate tho' the more refined and subtle Parts of it were in some Degree evaporated Miss  Hartley  if I may credit the Language of the Eyes which I consider as ocular Demonstration has declared she does not absolutely hate me and has half  promised to take the first Opportunity of Writing I wish I knew how to believe her They are now at a Relation's near  Reading  on a Visit but will soon be in Town when I shall not omit the Renewal of my Acquaintance  Adieu  W Easy  Miss  HARTLEY  to Miss  RUGG  Staples near Reading  March  My Dear Girl  HOW many thousand fine Speeches and Apologies have I to make for your Goodness in writing so often whilst I was at  Bath  and my own Neglect in never once answering you Really my Dear if you are unmerciful in your Demands upon me I must take out a Statute of Bankruptcy at once and oblige you to be satisfied with so much in the Pound Besides I have very good Reasons for my long Silence An incessant  Round of Dressing and Undressing Plays Balls and Diversions of one Sort or other hardly left me a Moment to myself and when this was the Case I dare say you would not have wished me to stupify myself with Scribbling  Heigh ho Do you know any Gentleman by the Name of  Easy  I danced with him one Night at the Rooms He introduced himself to my Father under pretence of an old Family Connection and we hardly ever stirred without him afterwards An old Family Connection Do you think my Vanity would suffer me to believe that my Dear Is it likely that a handsome young Fellow of six or seven and Twenty should hunt out a Man old enough to be his Grandfather  for the Sake of a Family Connection No no if there is any Truth in that Part of the Story I fancy he thinks the Traces of it are so nearly worn out that it is Time to strengthen them with a new one Let me hear your pretty serious Sentiments upon this and quickly too if you mean to write at all for in a Fortnight I hope to be in  London  and thenwho knows what may happen to  Yours most affectionately  Catharine Hartley  I had almost forgot to tell you that we are now at  Staples  with that wretched Antique Sir  Anthony Artichoke  a second Cousin of my Uncle's Wife's Brotherinlaw whom my Father chuses to call a Relation because he puzzles him in the dead Languages whenever they meet  CHARLES MELMOTH  to  WILLIAM EASY  Melmoth Place Norfolk  March  AND so my very good Friend and Companion  William Easy  Esquire is at last professedly in Love and willing to exchange the Indolence of a Law Student for the laborious Operations of regulating a Family and chewing Pap for his Children Really I think he is very much in the Right For my own Part though I have now been married above a Twelvemonth which according to the present Way of Thinking is a little Eternity and have been in  the Country almost ever since I do not yet find my Wife's Company at all  Ennuyeuse  or fatiguing nor have I once wished for a Repetition of the Gallantries I was engaged in during my Travels I think I may now venture to intrust you with thus much of my Mind without fear of being laughed at as an uxorious Rustic which I know would have been the Case half a Year ago The Amusements of the Field the Company of my Friends some of whom have been in the House ever since you left us and now and then that miserable  Dernier ressort  to all People of  Ton  one's own Wife have really been to me a very sufficient Source of Happiness and Satisfaction Besides I have been engaged with a continued  Series of Alterations both in House and Grounds under the Auspices of those two great Luminaries  Wyatt  and  Brown  Upon my Honour that same  Wyatt  is a Fellow of very superior Talents There is something so majestically Simple in his Ideas so contrary to the minute Frippery of the Generality that I am really in Raptures with him The Metamorphoses he has made in my House are the Effect of Magic He has digested and methodized that rude Chaos of Antichambers and Closets and "Passages that lead to nothing" which our ridiculous Ancestors were so fond of and for which you may remember my Habitation was particularly eminent There is now a very excellent  Suite  of Apartments  in Embrio and the haunted Parlour with marblecoloured Wainscot will make an incomparable DrawingRoom And all this since you was down with me last Summer By the Bye I desire that from this Time forth for evermore you direct your Letters to  Charles Melmoth  Esq  MelmothPlace  as I being determined the Name of my Seat shall not survive the Barbarism that authorized it have without Act of Parliament and relying upon my own Authority as Justice of the Peace issued Orders to all Constables Headboroughs c in the County of  Norfolk  to wit that they do by all legal Methods suppress and destroy the original Appellation of  Hollyhock Hall  and  in its stead substitute  MelmothPlace  aforesaid  But perhaps you begin to think this very little to the Purpose of your Amour and as every body is most fond of talking and writing about their own Affairs I must confess I had almost forgot myself However I wish you may succeed with all my Heart and in regard to Advice or Consultation will defer it for about a Fortnight when I design visiting  London  for a few Weeks and entering for the Time being into all the Vanity of Metropolitan Diversions So Farewell  Yours ever  Charles Melmoth  Miss  HARTLEY  to Miss  RUGG  Hillstreet Berkeleysquare  April  HOW very unlucky and perverse our Motions are One would think the crossgrained Fellow your Uncle contrived it on purpose  Thursday  Evening I once more set Foot in  London  having escaped from a miserable State of BondSlavery at  Staples  where we had dragged on near six Weeks of passive Existence without seeing a Soul but that old Applewoman Sir  Anthony  who is as disagreeable as the Place he lives in and two or three Country Neighbours who are still worse I thought my Father would never have quitted the  dull Place We really seem my Dear for these last two Years to have been running away from each other Always like Buckets one up and the other down And now poor Soul you are stationed at  Woodstock  are you for I called on you  Friday  Morning and finding you flown enquired all Particulars of the Servant and enjoy the agreeable Society of your maiden Aunts and your Rookery do you or if you wish for Solitude you are at full Liberty to sit under a Tree in the Garden by the Hour together thinking of  Rosamond  and her Bower and the Nunnery at  Godstow  What a Taste your Uncle has I was at  Romeo  and  Juliet  last Night and who does your great Penetration imagine I saw  there No less a Person than Mr  Easy  I can assure you He seemed somewhat surprized for he did not know I was in  London Entre nous  I had promised to write to him from  Staples  but was cruel enough or as you would say sufficiently prudent to disappoint him so that our Meeting was entirely unexpected on his Part He was in an Undress and looked killingly Negligent I can assure you There was another Gentleman with him whom he left and came up to us immediately My Father was quite rejoiced to see him and for myself filial Duty you know obliged me to experience a similar Sensation He talked a good Deal and looked much more Undoubtedly he is a very agreeable Man and there is  such an ingenuous  Naiveté  in his Behaviour that I am sure he must be an honest one He humoured my Father in his literary Quixotism and drew Comparisons between  Shakespeare  and the Ancients 'till he got himself invited to dine tomorrow with us  Nota Bene  His Eyes upbraided me horridly for not writing What a happy Thing it is that one Pair of young Eyes are quicker than two of old ones As for my Father he never sees at all without his Spectacles and they are seldom made use of for the Contemplation of living Objects So farewell my Dear write soon to one who will always consider herself  Your most affectionate Friend  Catharine Hartley  P S Do you know any thing of your Brother Sir  Thorobred  or when he returns to  England  I hope we shall find him a little more humanized and beginning to prefer the Society of his Fellow Creatures to that of his Horses  Miss  RUGG  to Miss  HARTLEY  Woodstock  April  AS you know where I am my Dear  Hartley  you will not be unreasonable enough to expect News from me Indeed if I thought you did I would not attempt writing As you very truly suppose I see little Company beside Rooks and maiden Aunts and for Conversation I have none but what my Books afford me from which however though you may laugh I receive great Entertainment and I hope some Instruction But come I'll not fatigue you with Matters of this Sort and yet I have nothing  else to say for myself unless you chuse a Panegyric upon the Charming Mr  Easy  By the Bye he is an intimate Acquaintance of my Brother's I have seen him often and could almost find in my Heart to pull Caps for him if I was ever disposed to be so furious  The Post is just come in with a Letter for me Perhaps it may assist my Dearth of News so excuse my reading it And now it is read take it as a Substitute for any farther Nonsense of my own And it is from a young Man too though that will now I suppose be no particular Recommendation However as you ask after him in your Postcript I will send it It is from my Brother who is at the  Hague  and talks of  returning to  England  very speedily He writes in his usual metaphorical Stile and seems as fond of Roughriding as ever But I shall leave you to judge for yourself and conclude  My Dear  Kitty  Yours most sincerely  Maria Rugg  The Inclosed Letter from Sir  THOBRED RUGG  to his Sister  Hague  April  YOU and I Sister are certainly as different Animals as ever boasted the Privilege of Christianity and yet I believe we love one another Whether I long to see you or old  England  again I do not know but I certainly am thoroughly tired of these damn'd Dutchmen Besides I have not stirred out of Stable except now and then to Exercise for this Month past with the Gout and my near Leg is devilishly puff'd still about the Fetlock Is not this a sad Misfortune for a young  Fellow as I am just coming four and twenty And as to the Farriers or Apothecaries as they call them I never knew such a Pack of Blockheads in my Life Their Remedies may do very well for a Dutch Constitution but I am sure they are enough to ruin an English one The People too seem dreadfully stupid in general and there is scarce a rational RidingSchool or Turf CoffeeHouse in the Place  Apropos  I bought a restiff Dutch CoachHorse about six Weeks ago for four Pound ten to amuse my Mornings with and worked him up and down the Streets to the great Annoyance of the Burgomasters I very near broke my Neck last Night Coming Home late with two young Fellows that I  scraped Acquaintance with about three Days before I fell over a Sow that lay snoring in the Middle of the Street She turned round immediately to bite me but before she had Time to get up we tied her Neck and Heels with an Handkerchief dragged her to a purblind Apothecary's Door and swore there was a Woman in Labour Down he came in his Nightcap and we took to our Heels leaving him to  deliver  her as well as he could Adieu I hope to see  England  next Month or perhaps sooner  Yours ever  Thorobred Rugg  Mrs  MELMOTH  to Mrs  MANCEL  PallMall  May  My Dear Mother  YOU desire me in your last to to give you some Account of what is going forward in this gay World what public Diversions are chiefly frequented and in one Word what is the  Ton  The Newspapers you complain give such strange Accounts of Depravity of Morals Extravagance of Dress and epidemical Folly on all Sides that you cannot credit it and indeed I was almost as faithless as yourself till my own Eyesight  converted or at least convinced me For without ocular Demonstration "Who" as  Gonzalez  says in the  Tempest    Would believe that there were Mountaineers  Dewlapt like Bulls whose Throats had hanging at them  Wallets of Flesh Or that there were such Women  Whose Heads stood in their Breasts But now  I'll believe both and what does else want credit come to me  And I'll be sworn 'tis true Travellers ne'er lied  Tho' Fools at Home condemn them  Really the whole seems like a Dream to me and I shall not be thoroughly awake again till I get back into the Country To begin with our own Sex as we certainly claim the Preference in every Thing "The human Face divine" which was wont to possess some Share of Preeminence and with its natural  Appendage of Hair and a few artificial Ornaments formed the Capital of the Pillar "The human Face divine" appears now according to the exact fashionable Proportion in the Middle of the Figure and a Lady of the  Ton  groaning under her

she had ran away with some Milkmaid's  May  Garland or was sinking under the complicated Ruin of a GreenGrocer's Stall Mr  Melmoth  for to call him Husband would be utterly Gothic keeps a Chair for me to visit in but I fear  I must soon put him to the Expence of another as I find it morally impossible to move about in the same Vehicle with my Headdress which I design to be preceded by in future as the Knights were by their Helmet in Days of Chivalry Nor are the Men one whit behind us in Point of Extravagance and Absurdity I never see one of them on Horseback when the Sun shines but I think of the Knight of the Looking Glasses in  Don Quixote  with Buttons as large and as beautiful as the Brassplates on a Streetdoor To compensate however for this Extravagance their Waistcoats are generally laced like a Woman's Stays and without any Buttons at all Then nobody can stir without two Watches so that a Man need  never be at a Loss to know how much Time he wastes and these decorated with enormous Gold Chains and as many Seals and Trinkets as would furnish a Jew Pedlar's TravellingBox As for the Article of Buckles their Size may perhaps render them extremely serviceable as Bridges in crossing over a Kennel but for their Beauty I must beg to be excused A few Nights since I went to  Stevens  's Lecture upon Heads and was not a little entertained He ridicules all the fashionable Absurdities most excellently A Head he defines to be a Kind of Wen or  Fungus  or in the Language of Botanists a Sort of Bulbous Excrescence growing out between the Shoulders whose chief Use is to hang a Hat  upon have one's Hair drest upon and the like And so much for the Vanities of this Wicked World Next Week I believe we shall return to the Country as Mr  Melmoth  begins to think his Presence necessary amongst his Workmen and I poor vulgar Creature find myself almost tired with this perpetual Round of Confusion So very luckily both Husband and Wife are agreed in this Matter As I shall see you soon I will not prolong my Scrawl but conclude with an Ode I received lately from a Lady of my Acquaintance exceedingly applicable to the present Subject It was sent her from  America

Eliza Melmoth  CHRISTOPHER HARTLEY  Esq  to Sir  ANTHONY ARTICHOKE  Hillstreet Berkeleysquare  May th past    at Night  My dear old Friend Sir Anthony  HAVING now been in  London  for some Weeks for you know I have been here ever since I left  Staples  I begin to think of writing to you to inquire after your Health and to mention such Circumstances as may have befallen me since our last Meeting It has always been my earnest Wish and Desire as you certainly must well remember I having frequently  opened myself on this Subject to you to procure for my Daughter a Man of deep Literature of profound and scientific Erudition as an Husband Learning says the Proverb is better than House and Land  For when House and Land are gone and spent  Then Learning is most excellent  and indeed I do not know how I should have weathered my Way through so many Years as I have done without it My Daughter is fond of gadding about and racketting at Public Places at present 'tis true but I don't doubt if I can meet with such an Husband for her she will be quite another Thing and then she may learn Logic and Mathematics and Greek  and that will be an everlasting Fund of Amusement even though they should live all the Year in the Country I do not much care about the Matter of Fortune in my Choice That will be no Object with me She is my only Child and I have enough for both of them But to come to the Point Do you know my good old Friend I really think I have found the Man I could wish for This very Evening I was drinking Tea at Mrs  Cypher  's when amongst other Questions enquiring after her Son who is of the University she told that he was gone upon a Visit to her Brother for a few Days that he was but just come up from  Oxford  and had with much Difficulty brought his Tutor Mr  Pedant  with him a Gentleman of about thirty Years of Age and who was reputed one of the cleverest most learned most agreeable Men in the University but added she with a Sneer he has kept it all to himself as yet for though he has been here three Days he has not advanced farther than Negatives and Affirmatives in his Discourse However you will see him presently These Words were scarce out of her Mouth before the Door opened softly and in came Mr  Pedant  I rose from my Chair as he approached in which he immediately seated himself without uttering a Word I must own I thought this a little odd but learned Men will have their Oddities So I drew another and began  entering into a Discourse with him Whilst I confined myself to the Politics and Public Amusements of our Country I cannot say that I found him very Communicative This is certainly a Mark of Wisdom and Erudition But when at last I touched upon the Manners of the Ancients and the Difference between the Policy of those Times and our own I perceived his Chair sliding gradually nearer and nearer to me bringing himself along with it with his Eyes fixed earnestly on the Fender Presently he turned his Face towards me and in a half Whisper that the Rest of the Company might not hear our Discourse began with the Wrath of  Achilles  in a dozen Lines from  Homer  and before we parted which  was not till near ten o'Clock had given me a very compleat Epitome of the  Grecian  History interspersed with excellent Remarks and Greek Quotations from  Herodotus Thucydides  c which though I did not understand all of them and cannot say I absolutely remember any yet nevertheless gave me an infinite Degree of Pleasure and Satisfaction In short my old Friend you may suppose I was quite enraptured and immediately invited him to Breakfast with me the next Morning to which he at first appeared to assent very readily but when I mentioned my having a Daughter at Home who was young and handsome he seemed much disturbed and would fain have pretended an absolute Obligation  to return directly to  Oxford  I suppose he began to suspect my Intentions upon him and thought his Time too precious to be wasted in the Company of Women Indeed I in some Degree intimated my Wishes for such a Soninlaw which might give him sufficient Reason for his Distrust However I would not let him off So I hurried Home and having acquainted my Daughter with the happy Prospect she had of such a Husband and ordered her to prepare to receive him I could not help sitting down instantly to inform you of it and as I fear the Post is gone out will send it by the early Stage tomorrow tied up like a Parcel that you may receive this happy Intelligence as speedily as possible My  dear old Friend good by'e to you I shall not sleep a Wink tonight  Your most true Friend  Christopher Hartley  P S Mr  Pedant  said he should certainly go to  Oxford  in a Day or two  Miss  HARTLEY  to Miss  RUGG  HillStreet  May  O My dear Girl what strange Things I have to tell you Such a Creature such a Lump of Learning has my Father picked out for my Husband You know his absurd Bigotry that way But I will scribble down the whole Transaction Last Night my Dear as I was just returned from two Routs and going to Dress for the  Pantheon  Masquerade half awake half asleep sitting on a Sopha in twenty Minds whether I should go or send an Excuse to my Party half eat up with the Spleen the Vapours  and that Kind of  Ennuyant  Nothingtodoishness which is worse than all the RestThe Door flew open and in hurried my Father as fast as ever two Sticks and a Pair of gouty Legs could carry him "My Dear Child" says he "make yourself happy Your utmost Wishes will be satisfied" So thought I what the Deuce is in the Wind now "My Dear Sir" says I turning round to him "what have you done Have you got me a Ticket for Lady  Racket  's Private Concert" "Concert" quoth he "No my Dear I have at last found out an Husband for you I met him this Night at Mrs  Cypher  's and have prevailed on him to Breakfast here tomorrow and pay you a Visit" Well thought I this must  be a curious Creature indeed if it is of your chusing "He is rather silent to be sure" added he "but you must talk to him I'm sure he is very learned"  After a little more Discourse of this Sort and five hundred Encomiums passed upon Mr  Pedant  for that is his Name off he went to Bed and for myself my Mind was too much engaged with the Drollery of the Adventure to suffer my going out that Night So I rang my Bell and went to Bed also dreamt all Night of nothing but Bookworms and Conjurers and at last waked in an horrible Fright with the Idea that I was almost squeezed to death by a great Dictionary that had fallen upon me from the Top of a Cupboard  In Process of Time as old story Books say Morning arrived which I had through mere Curiosity been longing for during the last three Hours almost as much as if I had been to seeany Body you chuse to guess at Between ten and eleven having waited some Time for Mr  Pedant  we sat down to Breakfast and just as the second Dish was poured out a double Knock proclaimed his Arrival The Room Door opened and in about half a Minute my Lover appeared His Method of Approach was to be sure somewhat singular Whilst the Door served him for a Screen his Advance was sideways somewhat in the Stile of a Crab with his Face close towards it This was followed by a sudden Evolution  upon the Heel to shut it after him in which Situation he remained near a Minute exhibiting one of the most ridiculous Back Fronts I ever beheld At last having atchieved this important Business he suffered us to take a Peep at his Face through the Medium of a dirty PocketHandkerchief which he had whipt up to his Nose at the Instant he turned towards us but never was any awkward Schoolboy when he comes home for the Holidays and finds his Mother in a Circle of Company half so  gauche  or  decontenancé  His Feet seemed fixed to the Ground at the awful Appearance of your humble Servant Really I never thought myself quite so terrible before By and by he advanced with the left Hand  fumbling in his Pocket as if he had lost Something and the other holding fast by the lower Button of his Coat but as Illluck would have it he had scarce proceeded three Steps when as he was gaping about for a Place to lay his Hat and a Chair to sit down on the sublime Majesty of my Presence assisted by a Corner of the Carpet according to the Doctrine of second Causes which his Foot happened to catch in so staggered him that down he prostrated at my Feet like a  Persian  before the Sun Poor Man I thought he had been in a Fit at first Should not you my Dear So I ran up to him and dropping upon one Knee "My dear Mr  Pedant  this is Adoration indeed Nothing Apoplectic Nothing  of the Dead Palsy sure You are not hurt I hope" "No he was not" he said with an Air sufficiently inelegant and at the same Instant rising with all the Hurry of Awkwardness not so nimbly however but that he contrived to tear my Apron and crush my Father's gouty Toe in his Recovery he squatted in the first Chair he came to which happened to be mine and sliding one Leg softly over the other fixed his Eyes upon his Shoe with a Look of Contemplation which I believe would have continued till this Time if nobody had disturbed him Well nothing is so odious as to see a Man in a brown Study or what is still worse picking his Thumbs and buttoning and unbuttoning his  Waistcoat like a City Taylor trying an illmade Suit of Cloaths on In this Attitude however did he contrive to drink a Dish of Tea which I carried him and to eat two or three Pieces of Bread and Butter As soon as the Breakfast Things were taken away my Father that he might not spoil Courtship rose to leave the Room His poor Companion though he had all the Dread of altering his Position as strong upon him as ever could not resist the Attraction but absolutely varied his Attitude and stealing his Head over his Shoulder by Degrees like a Boy that is afraid of an Apparition after he has been hearing frightful Stories eyed him wishfully to  the Door and if  mauvaise honte  had not for once stood his Friend would I dare say have given up all his Stock of Politeness to have followed him  He cast one longing lingering Look behind  We were now left to ourselves I in that odd Kind of dubious Humour which a Woman feels when she is in half a Dozen Minds whether to be cross or not found myself monstrously disposed for a little illnatured Raillery whilst my Swain so far from languishing with all the Ardour of an expiring Inamorato or opening his unhappy Case with a Sigh of Despondency endeavoured to entertain himself as aforesaid by squeezing  and twisting his Fingers and distorting his Countenance like a starved Frog in a Fit of the Cholic  True Love they say is always accompanied with Fear It deprives the most Eloquent of the Powers of Speech embarrasses the easy and polite Man and in short turns the whole human System topsy turvey If this be true and if it be true likewise that Mr  Pedant  is a polite and agreeable Man as my Father tells me he must be most desperately smitten indeed and I fear poor Fellow from the little Encouragement he is likely to receive from me will very soon put an End to himself or resume his Sciences which I believe will  be much the same Thing to the World in general  Well my Dear for two whole Hours I tormented him with a continued String of Commonplace Chitchat and every day Questions in which I was much assisted by the two Miss  Yaffles  who accidentally dropt in upon me I abused the Cut of his Coat informed him his Waistcoat was too long in the Pockets and enquired whether his Taylor was a  Frenchman  I asked him how he liked the new  Opera  whether he was at the  Pantheon  last  Monday  and told him I heard that he was a Proprietor of  Ranelagh  When I flagged for a Minute my Companions opened upon him and kept up an incessant Annoyance which he endured  not so much from Patience I believe as from the Horrors of making a Bow if he left us At last a polite Thundering at the Door like an additional Broadside determined him and considering that if he did not depart immediately the Enemy would receive a Reinforcement he jumped up from his Chair in an Instant and retreated like the  American  Army in a Gazette with the utmost Confusion  Alas poor  Easy  thou art ignorant what a dangerous Rival opposes thee But I do not think you will remain long so if it is in mine or my Father's Power to acquaint you with it Here is the State of the Case An agreeable young Fellow introduces himself to  my Father at  Bath  and by the assistance of quick Parts and a long CockandBull Story works himself completely into his good Graces Soon after it is thought necessary that I should be married and for this Purpose my wise Parent picks out as I verily believe one of the awkwardest Boobies in the whole Kingdom of  GreatBritain  for his Daughter to pay her Addresses to However a Confidant is thought requisite to talk Matters over with and now of all the Birds in the Air who would you suppose the quicksighted old Gentleman pitches upon but this very agreeable young Fellow this identical  Easy  whose Attachment to this very Daughter of his if he  had had the Sight of a Mole he must have discovered over and over again before this Time  This last Business of the Confidant I gathered from some Hints he dropped today for so much is his Mind occupied between his own Plan of Operations and his Investigation of what perhaps never happened among the Ancients that no Possibility ever enters his Head of the Enemy's being employed in counteracting him If I don't see the dear Fellow in a Day or two I'll write to him however that he may be prepared to receive this great Trust and Secret with due Composure of Countenance Adieu my dear  Rugg  expect farther Dispatches  speedily with the freshest Intelligence  Yours till Marriage at least For then I suppose I must belong entirely to my Husband  Catharine Hartley  WILLIAM EASY  to  CHARLES MELMOTH  Temple  May th Ten o'Clock at Night  O CHARLES O my Friend I am ruined I am undone I who last Night about this Time was the most happy Man breathing am now the most miserable I am betrayed robbed murdered and thrown into a Ditch "Such were" or at least such would be the Sounds of some despairing Bookseller's Prentice if he caught his favourite  Delia  in Bed with a Chimneysweeper Such Plaints such miserable Exclamations would  he blubber forth from the Abundance of his Master's Circulating Library when he found a Child sworn to him by his Mistress whose Creation he was conscious of having never assisted in But I  Charles  whom Difficulty does but encourage who find my Ardour increase in Proportion to the Obstacles I am to encounter shall tell you in plain  English  and in perfect Composure that I am rivalled in Miss  Hartley  's Affections Perhaps now you think me rather too  Easy  after such a Discovery I fancy however you will not be of that Opinion when I let you a little into the Character of my Opponent and the Means by which I became acquainted with the Affair His Name is  Pedant  his  Profession a College Tutor his Age I guess at about Thirty for I remember him well at the University about three Years longer standing than myself He is one of that particular Species of Beings who at School gain the Imputation of something uncommonly clever from a Kind of solitary Vanity and Affectation of Manliness which they have about them who never join in any of the Sports of their Schoolfellows but instead of playing at Cricket or Football on an Holiday pretend to read  Greek  under a Tree for their Amusement in Imitation of the old  Pagans  I suppose in the hallowed Groves of  Academe  and are for ever puzzling their Leisure Hours with Authors that they are not required to look  into and cannot possibly understand With this Stock of Knowledge they are sent to the University where they probably get a Scholarship or some little Emolument of that Sort Their Mind is now bewildered in all the Labyrinths of Science and having in the Course of about seven Years sufficiently perplexed themselves with Mathematics sophisticated themselves with Logic and got through all the Farce and methodized Nonsense necessary for taking Degrees the  Generals Juraments Wall Lectures  and  Examinations  they start up all at once Masters of Arts Tutors and Governors of their College a Set of the most erudite insolent awkward uncivilized Animals that ever honoured an University  or disgraced all other Parts of a Kingdom In Regard to the History of the Day or how the World goes as we say their Ignorance of present Occurrences is equalled by nothing but their thorough Acquaintance with the Statesmen Warriours and Demireps of Antiquity They are all a thousand Years behind Hand and I dare say would give a much better Account of the  Bellum Peloponnesiacum  the Pestilence that raged among the  Athenians  or the Burning of  Rome  by  Nero  the Emperor than they could possibly do of the present Contest with  America  the dreadful Effects of the late terrible Influenza or the firing  Portsmouth  Dockyard by  John  the  Painter  Strip their Gowns from their  Shoulders and lock them out of their Library their magical Powers are at an End and if they were turned loose in  London  in this Situation they would be far more at a Loss in every Respect than the late imported Specimen of Savages from the Islands of the South "Remember as  Caliban  says of  Prospero    First to possess his Books for without them  He's but a Sot as I am and hath not  One Spirit to commandBurn but his Books  Well my dear Friend do you think you should know this Rival from the Description I have given and do you think there is much to be feared from him all Circumstances considered Miss  Hartley  laughs at him and tormented him so completely the last Visit he made her which by the Bye was the first and that owing to her Father's pressing Invitation that I suspect he will soon fly off in a Tangent and have nothing farther to say to her But now for the Means by which I gained all this Knowledge This whole Day has been spent with old  Hartley  As soon as we were left to ourselves after Dinner he began with Mr  Pedant  and in about half an Hour unfolded his Plan of Operations to me as completely as I could have wished▪ concluding with desiring my Assistance as Confidant That before he left  London  which would not be till the End of  July  he meant  to visit  Oxford  whither he hoped I would accompany him and that he should if possible prevail upon  Pedant  to spend some Time with him in  Dorsetshire  During this Discourse you may guess I was in a most ridiculous Situation However I smothered my Astonishment tolerably well and entirely acquiesced in every Thing pretending to approve his Plan highly After Tea the old Gentleman took a Nap and consequently gave me the Opportunity of a charming  Tête à Tête  with  my Kitty  as I hope she will be which I believe did not much promote Mr  Pedant  's Interest On  Saturday  he departs to  Oxford  as I shall immediately to  Bed and defer the Conclusion of this Letter till tomorrow Good Night to you  W Easy  EASY  in Continuation  May th Friday Morning  IF you find any Thing abrupt or unconnected in this second Part of my Letter you must attribute it to the ridiculous Manner in which I was waked this Morning Between seven and eight o'Clock an Hour when you know nobody is stirring in  London  except Dustmen and Chimneysweepers with here and there an accidental Milkmaid or a Carriage returning from the Masquerade I was roused from a very sound Sleep by a violent and incessant Thundering at my Door By the Time I had  opened my Eyes and turned about to see what was the Matter I discovered the Author of all this Riot who had forced his Way in and was standing by my Bedside He was a very shabby looking Fellow about the middle Size with an old rusty Hat flapped over his Face a threadbare Coat of coarse blue Kersey close buttoned and in his Hand a very inimical Oak Staff of at least two Inches diameter For some Time I was in doubt whether to consider him as a Thief Thieftaker or Bailiff three Characters I am exceedingly averse to being connected with and should probably have laboured much longer under this Uncertainty had I not recognized the Voice of our old Friend and  Schoolfellow Sir  Thorobred Rugg  who arrived in  England  about three Days before and now made his Appearance with the Intention of breakfasting with me Whilst I was dressing he entertained me with the Detail of some of his  Holland  Exploits How he had terrified two  Jew  Merchants into a Fit of Illness by committing the dark Deed of Nature on their Sabbath with a mad  Dutchwoman  under a Hedge whom he gave a Schelling for her Trouble and had his Pocket picked into the Bargain How he had got drunk about a Week before he left the  Hague  and had thrown two Clappermen into one of the Canals having first packed them up carefully in a Couple of fourdozen Hampers  And finally how he had been rambling half over  London  last Night with his two Friends  Jack Surcingle  and  Tom Fetlock  whom he had met by Accident at the  Piazza  Coffeehouse How they had all been to a great Fire that had happened somewhere or other though he had forgot where that he had ran up one of the Ladders and brought down a Woman and Child from a two pair of Stairs Room that was burning had drank Purl with the Firemen and as he was coming home had got into an empty Watchbox and made a oneeyed Watchman take to his Heels and drop his Staff and Lantern by jumping out upon him and crying boh as he was returning to his Stand from the Alehouse  and how he had hung up another to the Hooks of a Butcher's Shambles by the Waistband of his Breeches  By the Time these Histories were finished I was dressed and ready for Breakfast when just as the first Dish of Tea was poured out he recollected that his Face had not been washed since his Arrival in  England  and ran immediately to my washing Stand This however did not answer his Purpose as the Bason which I had just been using was not emptied That it was possible to throw its Contents out of the Window and fill it with clean Water never once occurred to him if one may judge from the Method he substituted which was no other than dipping the Corner  of the Breakfast Cloth into his Teacup and wiping himself with his dirty Pocket Handkerchief My Breakfast and his Ablution being finished he turned his Face towards the Lookingglass and unluckily discovered that shaving also was in some Degree proper as he was engaged out to Dinner So all necessary Implements being produced for the Purpose he began his Operation but had scarcely cleared one Side of his Countenance when the injudicious Motion of the under Jaw occasioned by some sudden Remark he was about to make laid the Razor a full half Inch into his Cheek Blood followed pretty plentifully as you may imagine This however being staunched by scraping  from his Hat the small Quantity of Nap that remained there and applying to the Wound he determined to avoid risquing a second Incision by leaving the other Side of his Face untouched and having staid with me about an Hour longer he sallied out to pay a few more Morning Visits and from thence to the House whither he was engaged to Dinner  If ever Man had Pretensions to Originality surely this has and yet with all his Oddities and Foibles one cannot help liking him He is I really think a very worthy Fellow at Bottom and has a good Heart Old  Thistleberry  the Parson of his Parish in  Yorkshire  is dead lately and he means to present  Tom Fetlock  who is in Orders  to the Living In a few Days he goes to  Woodstock  upon a Visit to his Uncle and Sister and from thence to  Foxhall  his  Yorkshire  Seat His Sister I believe accompanies him thither and I am engaged to pay him a Visit when I can find Leisure This I fancy will soon take place as I should wish to spend some Time there and must nevertheless return to  London  early enough to attend old  Hartley  on his curious  Oxford  Expedition  Vive Vale  farewell  Your's  W Easy  CHARLES MELMOTH to WILLIAM EASY  Melmoth Place  June  YOUR last Letter my dear  Easy  was really a great Treat to me and I give you Joy of your Rival from the Bottom of my Soul What a Fund of Entertainment must he be to Miss  Hartley  his intended Wife if he accepts her Father's Invitation into  Dorsetshire  which however I have my Doubts about How often will his Presence be useful  "Vice Cotis"  instead of a Whetstone to sharpen her Wit upon and relieve her  Spirits from the dreadful Dejection of a Country Atmosphere Though I don't think her one of those mad Girls who can never exist but in the Noise and Dissipation of  London  She likes it very much when she is there 'tis true as indeed is natural enough but I really believe her capable of spending her Summer in the Country with no other Diversions than her Books her Horse and her Husband provided she is fond of him and now and then the Variety of visiting in a good Neighbourhood This at least is the Opinion I have been inclined to entertain from what I have heard or seen of her since the Night you introduced me at  Ranelagh  and you know I pique myself upon a ready Discernment  even into Women's Characters The Contrast between  Pedant  and our Friend Sir  Thorobred  in the first and second Parts of your Letter is exceedingly ridiculous and upon Paper makes no bad Figure How exquisite must a Meeting be between them I remember we had many of those walking Libraries at  Cambridge  I am glad the said Sir  Thorobred  is returned from the  Hague  my Compliments when you go down As you wisely remark there is something very original in the Composition of that Man Take away his excessive Passion for Horses and yet as every Body has their Hobbyhorse the Object perhaps may as well be real as metaphorical His Imitation of  Charles  the Twelfth in all the  negative Excellencies of dirty Face and Hands old blue Coats and Brass Buttons and that strange Extravagance and Wildness which is sometimes the Cause of good and sometimes of foolish Actions just as it happens which as Whim and Humour prompt will induce him to rescue a Woman out of a Fire or to throw a Waiter into one take away all this I say and he is a very rational Fellow As to Sense he is possessed of very quick natural Parts though I cannot say much for their Cultivation Literature he never was particularly fond of and when at the University the illiberal Manners of its Teachers greatly contributed I believe to make him despise the one for the Faults of the  other and throw it up entirely This was my general Opinion of his Character when I last saw him and by your Account of his Morning Visit in the  Temple  his Travels do not seem to have produced the least Alteration I may add likewise as the finishing Stroke to his Picture and which indeed the utter Neglect of his Person somewhat prepares one for that in Regard to all the Minutiae of Life if I may so call them such as snuffing a Candle without throwing the Snuff about mending a Pen tearing a Piece of Paper evenly or sealing a Letter without burning both it and his own Fingers with five Hundred other little Excellencies of this Sort he has not the least Idea of them Now whether  this proceeds from a natural and innate Awkwardness in such Matters or a Degree of Absence and Inattention to them I never yet could determine For if he wanted a Pair of clean Stockings and his Servant should bring a Silk and a Thread one or a Pair with half a dozen great Holes in them he would put them on without perceiving either the one or the other All these Peculiarities  Easy  you are full as well acquainted with as myself but upon mentioning his Name I could not help falling into Remarks and scribbling my Paper with them  To return now to the Beginning of your Letter for I will not trouble you this Time with any Hobbyhorsical Intelligence of my  Buildings and Alterations I am very sorry to find myself under the disagreeable Necessity of reprobating that profane Ridicule of modern Novels with which you open your Misfortunes and at the same Time must take the Liberty of informing you that "What should be great you turn to Farce" as  Prior  says I will not wish you punished by the Insertion of a Ladle or to search farther into Antiquity for a Quotation "What is Sport to you is Death to us"  Vide Aesop  's Fable of the Boys and Frogs To speak more plainly though your  London  Volatility may prompt you to laugh at every Thing that speaks feelingly to the softer Passions that tells the sad Tale of disappointed Love or  breathes amidst innumerable Stars and Dashes the Strains of Refinement and Sensibility our Country Swains and Damsels are very differently affected by them To promote your Conversion if that be possible I desire you will read the inclosed Letter which was found a few Days since in a Closet in one of the Garrets and by the Signature appears to have been written by Mrs  Melmoth  's last Maid who quitted her about a Twelvemonth ago I always thought there was something particular and romantic in the Girl and suspected a Love Affair at the Bottom The Argument of the inclosed is as follows That  John o'Nokes  and herself felt a mutual Attachment to each other and that she had almost given her  Consent to marry him but that unluckily  Tom O'Stiles  becoming acquainted with her about that Time is likewise desperately smitten Upon this he declares his Passion and she though not experiencing any similar Inclination on her Part and being also previously engaged is nevertheless worked up to such a Pitch of general Philanthropy and Sentiment and Pathos c c c as to determine that she will marry neither of them and by this noble Selfdenial according to our dull Apprehensions at least she makes three People unhappy instead of one Whether she took her Idea from  Foote  's Primitive Puppetshow I cannot pretend to say As to the Letter it appears to  have been written just before she quitted our Place and whither she went afterwards nobody knows hereabouts However I send you the Original and leave you to decipher it at your Leisure  About ten o'Clock last Night I was not a little surprised by the Appearance of my Brother  George  at  MelmothPlace  when I imagined him treading the Paths of Slaughter in  America  I cannot say his Looks are much improved by the Expedition Indeed he says that he has hardly enjoyed a Day's good Health since he left  England  and as the Climate does not at all agree with his Constitution he has obtained Leave of Absence and has some Thoughts of resigning his Commission and entirely quitting  the Army which he mentioned to General  Howe  before his Departure He says he had written a Letter to me about two Months since which I suppose must have miscarried One of his first Enquiries was after Miss  Rugg  for whom you know he always professed a certain  Tendre  as far at least as his Nature is capable of so I dare say if she goes down to  Yorkshire  with Sir  Thorobred  you will soon see him there He still retains his Attachment to  Morocco  Pocket Books Shagreen Toothpick Cases and Orange Flower Pomade and continues to read Lord  Chesterfield  's Letters with much Devotion though I don't think he imbibes any of the pernicious Parts of them Apropos  he talks of writing a long Letter to you soon on the Presumption of which Event taking Place I think it high Time to subscribe myself as I really am  Yours sincerely  Charles Melmoth  The Inclosed Letter  'TIS past the fatal Trial is over and my Resolutions are invincibly fixed What have been my Sensations what have been my Sufferings since I last saw you  Roger  But alas such is the Unhappiness of my Destiny why was I born to such a Load of unmerited Misfortune why was my Life marked out for one continued Scene of Misery and Distress It is tootoo much my Soul sinks under it and with a weak tremulous Languor wafts its Prayers incessant to the Throne of Mercy to put a  finite Period to the peculiar Wretchedness of its Existence  How happy was our last Meeting when we passed our  Sunday  Evening in the Fields of The Country seemed to glow with unusual Verdure whilst before us the

several Places as to render a Discovery of the Meaning impossible  Blood immediately  followed the Stroke and I suffered a considerable Degree of Anguish But alas what was that Pain compared to my mental Affliction He drew a Chair and seated himself by me without speaking a Word On a sudden he caught my Hand and looking stedfastly on my Face while the Tears started from his Eye uttered the following Words mingled with his Sighs  "I come not Mrs  Susan"  here his Voice faultered and he wiped his Nose with his Sleeve "I come not Mrs  Susan  I say" here he recovered himself a little  and proceeded in a rather firmer Tone  to displeasure you any more upon the Subject of Matrimony as I did before knowing well that you do not like me and besides that you are already engaged to  Roger  So alas there's an End of all Hopes on that Head for me But I hope you wont be angry with me for coming to take my last farewell of you For indeed I could not help coming to see you before I went  "Went" cried I with a Voice of the utmost Pity and Surprize  and whither art thou going  "I'm going" cried he sniveling  totolist for a Soldier I can't bear to see you belong to another ManYou were the

to make a Fellow Creature miserable for ever What shall I do how shall I act in this embarrassing Dilemma Shall I NoHappiness could never be my Lot Even in thy Arms I should Let us exert our Reason  Roger  let us call our Fortitude to our Assistance The Fates have decreed us to be unhappy but it is in our own Power whether we shall make others so If I am condemned to be wretched it will at least be some Consolation amidst the Bitterness of my Distresses some Alleviation of my insuperable Anguish to reflect that I have not contributed to the Misery of another If I am excluded from every Ray of Comfort and compelled to wander in the dark Paths and Labyrinths of Adversity Ah  Roger  I conceive his Misery the  Pains of Labour he must endure what intolerable Hardships  From the World I seclude myself for ever such is my fixed Resolution Before this reaches you I leave my Place and quit this Part of the Country Enquire no farther To find me out you need not endeavour I go where you will never more hear of the most unfortunate of her Sex Adieu Farewell for ever  Susannah Sentiment  Miss  HARTLEY  to Miss  RUGG  Hillstreet  June  MY dear  Rugg  how long do you mean to keep that odious Name by you I protest it gives one the Idea of something uncivilized even in the writing it and disperses every finer Idea one might have to communicate Besides 'tis so wholly inconsistent with your Character Do look out for a young Fellow with something delicate and  piano  in his Appellation and with a Disposition suited to your own Shall I recommend one to you Or will you accept of  one of mine  Easy  I cannot spare but you are welcome to my Father's Friend Mr  Pedant  at least as soon as I am tired with teasing him He is returned to  Oxford  the fittest Place for him What think you of the Name How would the Title of Mrs  Pedant  Wife and Bedmaker to a College Tutor sound in your Ears  Not to joke longer I have really a great Piece of News for you and something to propose seriously to your Consideration in the Matrimonial Way As for myself I believe I never shall think seriously of any Thing 'till I  am  married and then I suppose I must draw myself up with my Hands before me talk with a grave Face about the Cares of a Family and deliberate  with my Housekeeper for two Hours every Morning what Piece of salting Beef should be ordered from the Butcher and whether a Gooseberry or a Currant Pye will be best for Dinner  Come now for the News  Easy  dined with us a Day or two ago and amongst other Intelligence told us that he had received a Letter from his Friend  Charles Melmoth  mentioning the Return of his Brother the Captain from  America  on Account of the Climate not agreeing What think you of him for a  Caro Sposo  If I recollect he was an old Flame of yours before he went abroad  O I beg Leave to congratulate you likewise upon your Brother's Arrival The Name of  Rugg  was  for him and him only Pray present my respectful Compliments and tell him I rejoice to find he makes his public Entry in the Morning Post with so much  Eclat  I have seen him there with some Circumstances in Regard to the Course of his Travels which were entirely new to me  Such a Day arrived in  England  Sir  T R  commonly known by the Name of the rough riding or  Thoroughbred  Baronet from his Travels to the Country of the  Houyhnhnms  He is said to be much improved by this Expedition and has brought over with him a fine  Houyhnhnm  Stallion with two  Yahoos  to look after it He is the second  European  that ever  visited those Parts and is reported to have detected many Errors in Captain  Lemuel Gulliver  's Account which it is hoped he will soon favour the Public with  A few Days afterwards appears the following Paragraph  We are sorry to inform the Public of the Death of one of the Animals called  Yahoos  lately imported by a certain  Rugg  ed Baronet which happened on  Wednesday  last  It was occasioned a Correspondent informs us by the following Accident The Animal it seems having some Time before been very refractory and having even killed a Servant who attempted to chastise him was obliged to be  closely confined On  Wednesday  Morning however his Keepers unchained him and having as they thought sufficiently secured him with Ropes put him into a Cart in Order to remove him when unluckily the Rope about his Neck having a slip Knot to it entangled with a Post not far from the  Oxford Road  Turnpike and instantly strangled him Dr  Hntr  is said to be making Interest for the Body for Dissection as he proposes mounting the Skeleton upon that of the Queen's  Elephant  which he lately had the Honour to anatomize  O the Liberty of the Press we may well cry out that glorious Privilege of  Englishmen  Pray  tell me though in sober serious Sadness is all this true I have a monstrous Mind to write a long Letter to your Brother upon the Subject and protest that I believe every Word of it I find he intends taking you into  Yorkshire  with him I wish he would bring you to  London  to keep me Company for a Month for my Father for Reasons of State which I cannot dive thoroughly to the Bottom of has determined to continue here till the End of  July  or Beginning of  August Easy  tells me that he has an  Oxford  Jaunt in his Head and means to transplant  Pedant  into Dorsetshire What a charming Country Companion he must make for a  Tête à Tête  in an Arbour to pick up one's Ball of  Knotting or put one's Calash on with mathematical Precision Never need I be afraid of my Cap or Handkerchief being pinned awry when that happy Time arrives Besides I dare say as far at least as Things future may be conjectured from past my father's great Wisdom will insist upon  Easy  's accompanying us in his Capacity of Confidant and Confessor to the Party to forward this intended Match of mine In Expectation of these blessed Events I conclude without farther Ceremony  Ma chere Marie  Your's  Catharine Hartley  Remember I shall be very angry with you though if that demure prudish little Phiz of yours makes any Attempts upon the Fidelity of my Knight Errant when I venture him down in the  North  with you  CHRISTOPHER HARTLEY  Esq  to Sir  ANTHONY ARTICHOKE  HillStreet  June  WELL my old Friend Matters go on swimmingly between Mr  Pedant  and  Kitty  He came according to his Promise the next Morning to Breakfast and very glad I was to see him However he did not seem much inclined to talk whilst I was there which I suppose was owing to an Unwillingness to declare himself before a third Person So as soon as Breakfast was finished I quitted the Room that he might feel himself  more free and unembarassed when left alone with my Daughter And by the Sequel it proved that this Step of mine was very judicious for I went immediately into my Study which is next to the Room they sat in and listening attentively I soon found they had begun a Conversation together and though I could not hear what it was about yet I am sure my Daughter was very well pleased with him for I heard her laugh heartily Sometime after I could distinguish two other female Voices which upon Enquiry I found to appertain to the Miss  Yaffles  These seemed join in the Discourse which now grew louder and louder mixed with incessant Peals of Merriment As for Mr  Pedant  nothing could  be a stronger Proof of  his  Satisfaction than that he could hardly prevail upon himself to quit them for I believe he stayed there near four Hours So I have no Doubt in my own Mind but that he is a little hampered in the Charms of the Fair for even the most learned of us sometimes feel ourselves subject to the Passion of Love If he should what a happy Thing it will be for my Daughter Her Fortune will be made at once and I can tell her such Husbands are not to be met with every Day However I do not say much upon the Subject to her because I think these Things always turn out best when left to themselves but I have contrived such a Plan as must necessarily increase the Intimacy between  them insomuch that if I have any Skill in Prophecy Matters will be brought to a Conclusion before the End of the Summer I shall not let you any farther into the Secret before the first Part of my Design has actually taken Place as upon that the Success of the whole in a great Measure depends Not that I have the least Fear of its failing for I have a Confidant to assist me in the Business by whose Diligence and Exertions I have no Doubt of all Things being brough  to a right Issue Who he is I shall not inform you at present a Secresy you know is the Soul of Conspiracy and they say Walls have Ears but shall proceed now with transcribing my Sentiments on a Subject which indeed I should  have mentioned much sooner had not my Proceedings and Considerations concerning my Daughter's Marriage left me hardly a Moment to spare for any other Business I mean the  Nihil  or  Nothing  of the Schoolmen which if you recollect we disputed about for three Afternoons at  Staples  when neither of us being able to make his Ideas on the Subject at all clear to the Understanding of the other we left off just where we begun  Now I am inclined to think that there is a very considerable Distinction and Difference to be made between  Nothing  as taken in its strict and confined Sense and  Nothing  taken in its more general and extensive one  Nothing  taken strictly seems to be that which is impossible  and implies an absolute Contradiction whereas  Nothing  taken more generally is applied both to what is possible as well as what is impossible Again  Nothing  may be distinguished into a Negative which is the Absence of Reality in any Subject and then there is  Nothing  privative which is the Absence of Reality in a Subject capable thereof or wherein it ought to be found And as to the  Possibility  or  Impossibility  of a Thing we know that to be  impossible  which exceeds or is beyond all possible Bounds and which in short can never happen And if this be true it necessarily follows according to the Argument deduced from Contraries that whatsoever does not exceed or go beyond those  Bounds but which from its not exceeding is consequently and necessarily contained therein may be denominated or considered as a Thing  possible  or to be done And of Things  possible  there are several Species First there is the  probable  or what is likely to come to pass then there is the  improbable  or unlikely which nevertheless is a Species of the  possible  inasmuch as many Things may be very  possible  though they are very  improbable  And in Regard to Things  probable  and  improbable  it is often very  probable  that a Thing should happen contrary to all  Probability  as  O Fallacem Hominum Spem fragilemque Fortunam et inanes nostras Contentiones  says  Cicero  I have been this Quarter of an Hour seeking after the Continuation of my Treatise which was written upon an old Letter Cover and upon enquiring of my Servant if he knew any thing of the Matter have the Unhappiness to find that before this Time it has been made Use of in cleaning a Gridiron or singeing a Fowl or some such culinary Employment as he informed me that he had seen the Housemaid bringing a considerable Quantity of Papers down Stairs in the Morning which she had given to the Cook for the Use of the Kitchen and which me said  she supposed were of no Signification as she had looked at them and cou'd'nt make nothing out of 'em and they laid about and  look'd littering in Master's Room  Well what a provoking Circumstance this is and particularly at present as my Thoughts are so taken up with Mr  Pedant  and my Daughter that I shall hardly find Time to compose it over again Therefore my dear old Friend and Cousin God be with you  Christopher Hartley  Sir  THOROBRED RUGG  to  WILLIAM EASY  Esq  Woodstock  June  HERE I am  Easy  according to my Intentions paying a Visit to my Uncle or Sister and enjoying the Benefit of a Fortnight's Grass in  Oxfordshire  In a few Days however I think of being led down to  Foxhall  and my Sister has promised to accompany me by way of arranging my Domestic Matters a little The Stable I consider as my own Department so shall not permit her to interfere  there I came down here upon a Hack I bought at  Tattersall  's which I meant to have rode to  Yorkshire  but a damn'd Brute of my Uncle's one of the Carthorses kicked him plump on the Stifle Yesterday Morning as they were in the Field together He is a develish clever Gelding A dark Chesnut fifteen Hands and an Inch fine Forehand rather too much Daylight under him but gets on hellishly a remarkable Gift of going a very good Mouth and he shall be a sound one however So I shall be obliged to kick myself down upon Posthorses as for a Chaise I hate it and leave him behind me for the present I met  Tom Fetlock  the Day I saw you and desired him to come to  Foxhall  as soon as he could that I should be down in ten Days or a Fortnight and expected to find him ready to receive me Pray when do I see you there I hope speedily I have a little grey Poney with a hogg'd Mane will just suit your sober Stile of riding It is what you would call as quiet as a Lamb and I a damn'd Slugg or a Jackass At least it was so before I went Abroad I used sometimes to ride him to cover but he's got almost too old for Work now I never regretted any thing so much in my Life since the Day I strained  Black Sloven  leaping a Turnpike Gate as I did losing the last Hunting Season in  Holland  Poor Fellow he never was worth Sixpence  afterwards though I got him tolerably well of that too but then and what the  Devil  was the Meaning of it I can't conceive there came a Windgall in the near Fetlock behind So I opened the Swelling about an Inch and squeezed out the Jelly and put some white of Egg and Oil of Bays with Tow to it but I believe it was too much amongst the Sinews for I was obliged to sell him at last to  March  at  Maidenhead  who fired him and worked him on the Road Adieu  Yours  Thorobred Rugg  Miss  RUGG  to Miss  HARTLEY  Woodstock  June  MANY Thanks my Dear for your two very communicative Letters Upon my Word you have tormented poor  Pedant  in such a Manner that I fear your Charms will hardly be able to prevent his running away not  with  but  from  you Tomorrow my Brother departs for  Yorkshire  on Horseback as usual accompanied by your humble Servant in a Chaise Should nothing material prevent I shall probably spend great Part of the Summer with him as he seems to  wish much for my Company besides  Easy  's Appearance there will certainly be an additional Inducement and we are not without Hopes of seeing Captain  Melmoth  at least my Brother designs giving him an Invitation Somehow or other I wish he may come down to us He is such an agreeable convenient Man in the Country and he is always so ready to ride or walk or do just as I please with Do not imagine from this now that I have any Thoughts of him in a serious Way notwithstanding your Recommendation And yet if I was obliged to submit to an Husband I think I might like him well enough provided that he was not in the Army But that Circumstance believe me would be  an invincible Barrier supposing all other Matters could be brought about of which however there is not the least Prospect and therefore let us drop the Subject  My Brother returns you many Thanks for the Honour of your obliging Enquiries as well as for the Paragraphs relative to his Travels which you were so kind as to transcribe  What dreadful Fatigues he must have undergone in America if one half of the Newspaper Accounts are true  As to his being improved by his Expedition he desires me to tell you that  he is infinitely the worse for it I fear or he would hardly have quitted the Country on Account of his Health however at all Events I am glad he is returned  Good God what Nonsense  have I written Well  Kitty  since the Discovery is made I will not erase my Weakness Interpret me as you please That I may not however add to my Folly I beg Leave instantly to subscribe myself  Your most affectionate  Maria Rugg  END OF THE FIRST VOLUME
