cherry bounce  With swearing tearing ranting jaunting slashing smashing smacking cracking rumbling tumbling  Laughing quaffing smoaking joking swaggering staggering  So thoughtless so knowing so green and so mellow  This this is the life of a frolicksome fellow  My phaet'n I mount and the plebs they all stare  I handle my reins and my elbows I square  My ponies so plump and as white as a lilly  Through Pall Mall I spank it and up Piccadilly  Till losing a wheel egad down come I smack  So at Knightsbridge I throw myself into a back  At Tattersall's fling a leg over my nag  Thus visit for dinner then dress in a bag  With swearing c  I stroll round the garden and call at the Rose  And then at both Playhouses pop in my nose  I lounge in the lobby laugh swear slide and swagger  Talk loud take my money and out again stagger  I meet at the Shakespeare a good natur'd soul  Then down to our club at St James's I roll  The joys of the night are a thousand at play  And thus at the finish
