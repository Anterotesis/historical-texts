THE MOST Important and Entertaining Subjects In GENTEEL LIFE  Publish'd in order to cultivate the Principles of VIRTUE and RELIGION in the Minds of the YOUTH of BOTH SEXES  VOL IV  LONDON  Printed for S RICHARDSON And Sold by C RIVINGTON in  St Paul  's  ChurchYard  And J OSBORN in  Paternoster Row    MDCCXLII  PAMELA OR VIRTUE Rewarded In a Series of  FAMILIAR LETTERS  VOL IV  LETTER I From Miss  Darnford  to Mrs  B  My dearest Mrs  B  _WE are greatly obliged to you for every particular Article in your entertaining Journal which you have brought sooner than we wish'd to a Conclusion We cannot express how much we admire you for your judicious Charities so easy to be practised yet so uncommon in the Manner and for your inimitable Conduct in the Affair of your frail  Polly  and the silly Mr  H  Your Account of the Visit of the Four Rakes and of your Parting with your noble Guests your Verses and Mr  H  's Letter an Original indeed have all greatly entertain'd us as your Prerogative Hints have amus'd us But we defer our Opinions of those Hints till we have the Case more fully explain'd  But my dear Friend are you not in Danger of falling into a too thoughtful and gloomy way By the latter Part of your Letter we are afraid you are and my Mamma and Mrs  Jones  and Mrs  Peters  injoin me to write to caution you on that Head But there is the less need of it because your Prudence will always suggest to you Reasons as it does in that very Letter that must outbalance your Fears  Think  little and  hope  much is a good Lesson in your Case and to a Lady of your Temper and I hope Lady  Davers  will not in vain have given you that Caution After all I dare say your Thoughtfulness is but symptomatical and will go off in proper Time  Mean time permit me to chuse you a Subject that will certainly divert you You must know that I have been a diligent Observer of the Conduct of People in the marry'd Life to each other and have often pronounced that there cannot be any tolerable Happiness in it unless the one or the other makes such Sacrifices of their Inclinations and Humours as renders it a State very little desirable to free and generous Minds Of this I see an Instance in our own Family for tho' my Papa and Mamma live very happily it is all owing to one Side I need not say which And this I am sure must be the Case between Mr  B  and you For you must even thro' Fire if requir'd sacrifice to  Moloch  I know your Prudence will oblige you to make the best of it and like a contented good Wife you will say You have your own Will in every thing A good Reason why Because you make your own Will his This long ago we all decreed any Lady must do be her Quality ever so great who would be happy with Mr  B  Yet my Sister once hoped  entre nous  to be the Person Fine Work would there have been between two such Spirits you may believe  But to wave this Let me ask you Mrs  B  Is your Monarch's Conduct to you as  respectful  I don't mean fond when you are alone together as when in CompanyForgive me Madam But you have hinted two or three times in your Letters that he always is most complaisant to you in Company and you observe that  wisely  does he act in this Because he thereby does Credit with every body to his own Choice I make no doubt that the many charming Scenes which your Genius and fine Behaviour furnish out to him must as often as they happen inspire him with Joy and even Rapture and must make him love you more for your Mind than for your PersonBut these rapturous Scenes last very little longer than the present Moment What I want to know is Whether in the  steadier  Parts of Life when you are both nearer the Level of us common Folks he gives up any thing of his own Will in Compliment to yours Whether he acts the Part of a respectful polite Gentleman in his Behaviour to you and breaks not into your Retirements in the Dress and with the brutal Roughness of a FoxhunterMaking no Difference perhaps between the Field or his Stud I will not say Kennel and your Chamber or ClosetPolicy for his own Creditsake as I mention'd accounts to me well for his Complaisance to you in Publick But his regular and uniform Behaviour to you in your Retirements when the Conversation between you turns upon usual and common Subjects and you have not obliged him to rise to Admiration of you by such Scenes as those of your two Parsons Sir  Jacob Swynford  and the like are what would most engage my Curiosity if you please to give me an Instance or two of it  Now my dearest Mrs  B  if you can give me a Case partly or nearly thus circumstanced you will highly oblige me  First Where he has borne with some Infirmity of your own and I know of none where you can be guilty of any except you get into a vapourish Habit by giving way to a Temper too thoughtful and apprehensive  Next That in Complaisance to  your  Will he recedes from  his own  in any one Instance  Next Whether he breaks not into your Retirements unceremoniously and without Apology or Concern as I hinted above  You know my dear Mrs  B  all I mean by what I have said and if you have any pretty Conversation in Memory where this my bold Curiosity may be answer'd pray oblige me with it and we shall be able to judge by it not only of the inborn Generosity which all that know Mr  B  have been willing to attribute to him but of the Likelihood of the Continuance of both your Felicities upon Terms suitable to the Characters of a fine Lady and fine Gentleman and of consequence worthy of the Imitation of the most delicate of our own Sex  This is the Task your  Polly Darnford  presumes to set to her beloved Mrs  B  And why For your own Diversion in the  first  Place For my Edification in the  next  And that when I have the Pleasure I hope for of attending you in  London  I may see what there is in the Conduct of you both to admire or to remonstrate against in the  Third  For where there is so little wanting to Perfection between you I shall be very free with you both in my Censures if he imposes thro' Prerogative or you permit thro' an undue Compliance what I shall imagine ought not to be in either Case I know you will excuse me for what I have said and well you may since I am sure I shall have nothing to do when I am with you but to admire and to imitate  you  and to wish if ever I marry I may have just  such an Husband tho' not quite so haughty perhaps as Mr  B  But pray let not the lordly Man see this Letter nor your Answer nor the Copy of it till you may conclude I have the latter if then that you may not be under any undue Influences  Your obliging  Longings  my beloved dear Lady for my Company I hope will be soon very soon answer'd My Papa was so pleased with your sweet Earnestness on this Occasion that he join'd with my Mamma and both with equal Chearfulness said You should not be many Days in  London  before me  Murray  and his Mistress go on swimmingly and have not yet had one Quarrel The only Person he of either Sex that ever knew  Nancy  so intimately and so long without one  This is all I have to say at present when I have assured you my dear Mrs  B  how much I am  Your obliged and affectionate  POLLY DANFORD  I must add however that I expect from you almost as many Letters as there are PostDays between this and the Time I see you for I will not part with my Correspondent for any body no not for Lady  Davers    But I must insist upon your giving me the Conversation with the young Ladies related to Mrs  Towers  and Mrs  Arthur    I will observe every thing you say in relation to Mrs  Jewkes  who is much as she was but not better  LETTER II  My dearest Miss  Darnford  I Was afraid I ended my last Letter in a gloomy way and I am obliged to you for the kind and  friendly Notice you take of it It was owing to a Train of Thinking which sometimes I get into of late I hope only symptomatically as you say and that the Cause and Effect will soon vanish together  But what a Task my dear Miss I'll warrant you think you have set me I thought in the Progress of my Journal and in my Letters I had gjven so many Instances of Mr  B  's polite Tenderness to me that no new ones would be requir'd at my Hands and when I said he was always  most  complaisant before Company I little expected that such an Inference would be drawn from my Words as would tend to question the Uniformity of his Behaviour to me when there were no Witnesses to it But I am glad you give me an Opportunity to clear up all your Doubts on this Subject To begin then  You first desire an Instance Where Mr  B  has borne with some Infirmity of mine  Next That in Complaisance to my Will he has receded from his own  And lastly Whether he breaks not into my Retirements unceremoniously and without Apology or Concern making no Difference between the Field or the Stud and my Chamber or Closet  I know not my dear Miss what the Distance is at which the polite Ladies and those of Rank think it proper to endeavour to keep their Husbands But I will give you byandby the Subject of one Conversation only which will answer all you mean as I apprehend and at the same time acquaint you with the Notions and Behaviour of us both with respect to this Distance and my Retirements and then leave you to judge as you think fit  As to the first his bearing with my Infirmities he is daily giving Instances of his Goodness to me on this Head and I am asham'd to say that of late I give him so much Occasion for them as I do But  he sees my Apprehensiveness at times tho' I endeavour to conceal it and no Husband was ever so soothing and so indulgent as Mr  B  He gives me the best Advice as to my Malady if I may call it one Treats me with redoubled Tenderness talks to me upon the Subjects I most delight to dwell upon as of my worthy Parents what they are doing at this time and at that of our intended Journey to  London  of the Diversions of the Town of Miss  Darnford  's Company and when he goes abroad sends up my good Mrs  Jervis  to me because I should not be alone At other times takes me abroad with him brings this Neighbour and that Neighbour to visit me and carries me to visit them Talks of our Journey to  Kent  and into  Lincolnshire  and to my Lady  Davers  's to  Bath  to  Tunbridge  and I can't tell whither when the apprehended Time shall be overIn fine my dear Miss  Darnford  you cannot imagine one half of his tender Goodness and Politeness to me Indeed you cannotThen as to what you call  respectful  he watches every Motion of my Eye every Turn of my Countenance seldom gives his Opinion upon Subjects that he kindly imagines within my Capacity till he has heard mine and I have the less Fear of falling into mean Compliances because his Generosity is my Guardian and never fails to exalt me more than I can debase myself or than it is possible I can deserve Then he hardly ever goes out to any Distance but he brings me some pretty Present that he thinks will be grateful to me When at home is seldom out of my Company delights to teach me  French  and  Italian  and reads me Pieces of manuscript Poetry in several of the modern Tongues for he speaks them all explains to me every thing I understand not delights to answer all my Questions and to incourage my Inquisitiveness  and Curiosity tries to give me a Notion of Pictures and Medals and reads me Lectures upon them for he has a fine Collection of both and every now and then will have it that he has been improved by my Questions and Observations  What say you to these things my dear Miss Do they come up to your first Question or do they not Or is not what I have said a full Answer were I to say no more to  all  your Inquiries Can there be any such thing as  undue Compliances  to such an Husband on my Side think you And when I have charm'd to sleep by my grateful Duty that watchful Dragon  Prerogative  as Lady  Davers  in one of her Letters calls it and am resolved not to awake it if I can help it by the least disobliging or wilfully perverse Act what have I to apprehend from it  O my dear Miss I am thoroughly convinc'd that half the Misunderstandings among marry'd People are owing to Trifles to petty Distinctions to mere Words and little captious Follies to Overweenings or unguarded Petulances And who would forego the solid Satisfactions of Life for the sake of triumphing in such poor Contentions if one could triumph  Are such Foibles as these to be dignify'd by the Name of  Inclinations  and  Humours  which to be given up would be making such a  Sacrifice as shall render the married Life little desirable to free and generous Minds    But say not my dear Miss to  free  and  generous Minds  For every high Spirit deserves not those Epithets Nor think what I say a Partiality in behalf of my own Conduct and an Argument for Tameness of Spirit and such an one as would lick the Dust for let me tell you my dear Friend that dearly as I love and honour my Mr  B  if he were to require  of me any thing that I thought it was my Duty not to comply with I should be the unhappiest Creature in the World because I am sure I should withstand his Will and desire him to excuse my Compliance  But then I would reserve my Strength for these  greater  Points and would never dispute with him the  smaller  altho' they were not intirely to my Likeing And this would give both Force and Merit to the Opposition when I found it necessary But to contest every little Point where nothing but one's stubborn Will was in the Question what an inexcusable Perverseness would that be How ready to enter the Lists against an Husband would it make one appear to him And where besides is the Merit of Obliging were we only to yield to what will oblige ourselves  But you next require of me an Instance where in Complaisance to  my  Will he has receded from  his own  I don't know Miss what to say to this When Mr  B  is all Tenderness and Indulgence as I have said and requires of me nothing that I can have a material Objection to ought I  not  to oblige him  Can  I have a Will that is not his Or would it be excusable if I  had  All little Matters as I have said I chearfully give up Great ones have not yet occurr'd between us and I hope never will One Point indeed I have some Apprehension  may  happen and that to be plain with you is We have had a Debate or two on the Subject which I maintain of a Mother's Duty to nurse her own Child and I am sorry to say it he seems more determin'd than I wish he were against it  I hope it will not proceed so far as to awaken the sleeping Dragon I mention'd  Prerogative  by Name but I doubt I cannot give up this Point very contentedly But as to lesser Points had I been  a Duchess born I think I would not have contested them with my Husband  Upon the Whole of this Question then I have really had no Will of my own to contend for so generous is Mr  B  and so observant and so grateful have I thought it my Duty to be yet I could give you many respectful Instances too of his receding when he has desir'd to see what I have been writing and I have told him to whom and begg'd to be excus'd One such  nstance I can give since I began this Letter This is it  I put it in my Bosom when he came up He saw me do so  Are you writing my Dear what I must not see  I am writing to Miss  Darnford  Sir and she begg'd you might not at present  This augments my Curiosity  Pamela  What can two such Ladies write that I may not see  If you won't be displeased Sir I had rather you would not because Miss desires you may not see her Letter nor this my Answer till the latter is in her Hands  Then I will not return'd Mr  B  Will this Instance my dear Miss come up to your Demand for one where he recedes from his own Will in Complaisance to mine  But now as to what both our Notions and our Practice are on the Article of my Retirements and whether he breaks in upon them unceremoniously and without Apology let the Conversation I promised inform you which began on the following Occasion  Mr  B  rode out early one Morning within a few Days past and did not return till the Afternoon an Absence I had not been used to of late and breakfasting and dining without him being also a new thing to me I had such an Impatiency to see him having  expected him at Dinner that I was forced to retire to my Closet to try to divert it off by writing and the gloomy Conclusion of my last was then the Subject He return'd about Four o'Clock and indeed did  not  tarry to change his Ridingdress as your Politeness my dear Friend would perhaps have expected but came directly up to me with an Impatiency to see me equal to my own when he was told upon Inquiry that I was in my Closet  I heard his welcome Step as he came upstairs which generally after a longer Absence than I expect has such an Effect upon my fond Heart that it gives a responsive Throb for every Step he takes towards me and beats quicker and faster as he comes nearer and nearer till tapping my Breast I say to it sometimes Lie still busy Fool as thou art Canst thou not forbear letting thy discerning Lord see thy nonsensical Emotions I love to indulge thee in them myself 'tis true but then let nobody else observe them for generous as thy Master is thou mayst not perhaps meet with such favourable Interpretations as thou deservest when thou art always fluttering thus as he approaches and playest off all thy little joyful Frolicks into the glowing Cheek and brighten'd Eye of thy Mistress which makes her look as if she were conscious of some Misdemeanour when all the time it is nothing in the world but grateful Joy and a Love so innocent that the purest Mind might own it  This little Flutter and Chiding of the busy Simpleton made me meet him but at the Closetdoor instead of the Entrance of my Chamber as sometimes I doSo my dear Love how do you folding his kind Arms about me and saluting me with Ardour Whenever I have been but a few Hours from you my Impatience to see my Beloved will not permit me to stand upon the Formality of a  Message to know how you are ingag'd but I break in upon you even in my Ridingdress as you see  Dear Sir you are very obliging But I have no Notion of  mere  Formalities of this kind How unpolite this my dear Miss in your Friend in a married State since 'tis impossible a virtuous Wife can be imploy'd about any thing that her Husband may not know and so need not fear Surprizes  I am glad to hear you say this my  Pamela  for I have always thought the extraordinary Civilities and Distances of this kind which I have observed among several Persons of Rank altogether unaccountable For if they are exacted by the Lady I should suspect she had Reserves which she herself believ'd I could not approve of If not exacted but practised of Choice by the Gentleman it carries with it in my Opinion a false Air of Politeness little less than affrontive to the Lady and dishonourable to himself for does it not look as if he supposed and  allowed  that probably she might be so imployed that it was necessary to apprise her of his Visit left he should make Discoveries not to her Credit or his own  One would not Sir for I thought his Conclusion too severe make such a harsh Supposition as this neither For there are little Delicacies and Moments of Retirement no doubt in which a modest Lady would be glad to be indulged by the tenderest Husband  It may be so in an  early  Matrimony before the Lady's Confidence in the Honour and Discretion of the Man she has chosen has disingag'd her from her Bridal Reserves  Bridal Reserves dear Sir permit me to give it as my humble Opinion That a Wife's Behaviour ought to be as pure and as circumspect in Degree as that of a Bride or even of a maiden Lady be her Confidence  in her Husband's Honour and Discretion ever so great For indeed I think a gross or a careless Demeanour little becomes that Modesty which is the peculiar Excellency and Distinction of our Sex  You account very well my Dear by what you now say for your own overnice Behaviour as I have sometimes thought it But are we not all apt to argue for a Practice we make our own because we  do  make it our own rather than from the Reason of the Thing  I hope Sir that is not the present Case with me for permit me to say That an overfree or negligent Behaviour in a Lady in the marry'd State must be a Mark of Disrespect to her Consort and would shew as if she was very little solicitous about what Appearance she made in his Eye And must not this beget in him a slight Opinion of her and her Sex too as if supposing the Gentleman had been a free Liver she would convince him there was no other Difference in the Sex but as they were within or without the Pale licens'd by the Law or acting in Defiance of it  I understand the Force of your Argument  Pamela  But you was going to say something more  Only Sir permit me to add That when in my particular Case you injoin me to appear before you always  See  Vol II  p    dress'd even in the early Part of the Day it would be wrong if I was less regardful of my Behaviour and Actions than of my Appearance  I believe you are right my Dear if a precise or unnecessary Scrupulousness be avoided and where all is unaffected easy and natural as in my  Pamela  For I have seen marry'd Ladies both in  England  and  France  who have kept a Husband at greater Distance than they have exacted from some of his  Sex who have been more intitled to his Resentment than to his Wife's Intimacies  But to wave a Subject in which as I can with Pleasure say neither of us have much Concern tell me my Dearest how you were imploy'd before I came up Here are Pen and Ink Here too is Paper but it is as spotless as your Mind To whom was you directing your Favours now May I not know your Subject  Mr  H  's Letter was a Part of it and so I had put it by at his Approach and not chusing he should see that I am writing reply'd I to Miss  Darnford  But I think you must not ask me to see what I have written  this  time I put it aside that you should not when I heard your welcome Step The Subject is our parting with our noble Guests and a little of my Apprehensiveness on an Occasion upon which our Sex may write to one another but for some of the Reasons we have been mentioning Gentlemen should not desire to see  Then I will not my dearest Love So here Miss is another InstanceI could give you an hundred suchof his receding from his own Will in Complaisance to mine Only continued he let me warn you against too much Apprehensiveness for your own sake as well as mine for such a Mind as my  Pamela  's I cannot permit to be habitually overclouded And yet there now hangs upon your Brow an Overthoughtfulness which you must not indulge  Indeed Sir I was a little too thoughtful from my Subject before you came but your Presence like the Sun has dissipated the Mists that hung upon my Mind See you not and I press'd his Hand with my Lips they are all gone already smiling upon him with a Delight unfeigned  Not quite my obliging Charmer and therefore if you have no Objection I will change my Dress and attend you in the Chariot for an Hour or two whither you please that not one Shadow may remain visible in this dear Face And then he saluted me with Ardour  Whither you please Sir A little Airing with you will be highly agreeable to me  The dear Obliger went and chang'd his Dress in an Instant and he led me to the Chariot with his usual tender Politeness and we had a charming Airing of several Miles returning quite happy chearful and delighted with each other's Conversation without calling in upon any of our good Neighbours For what need of that my dear Miss when we could be the best Company in the World to each other  Now Miss do these Instances come up to your Questions Do they or do they notIf you think not I could give you our Conversation in the Chariot for I wrote it down at my first Leisure so highly was I delighted with it For the Subject was my dearest Parents a Subject started by himself because he knew it would oblige me But being tir'd with writing I may reserve it till have the Pleasure of seeing you if you think it worth asking for And so I will hasten to a Conclusion of this long Letter  You will perceive my dear Miss by what I have written in what Sense it may be  justly  said That Mr  B  is  most  complaisant to me before Company perhaps politically as you say to do Credit to his own generous ChoiceBut that he is more tender yea  respectfully  tender for that's the Word with you and not less polite to me in our retired Hours you will have no Doubt from what I have related and could further relate if it was necessary For  every Day produces Instances equal to what I have given you  Then my dear Miss let me say to you what I could not so freely say to any other young Lady That I never could have hoped I should be so happy as I am in other Particulars from a Gentleman who has given himself the Liberties Mr  B  has done For I never hear from him in Company or when alone the least shocking Expression or such frothy Jests as tend to convey impure Ideas to the most apprehensive Mind There is indeed the less Wonder in this and that we can glory in a true conjugal Chastity as I have the Vanity to think his Love as well as my own is the Love of the Mind rather than that of Person and our tenderest and most affecting Moments are those which lift us up above Sense and all that Sense can imagine But this is a Subject too delicate to be dwelt upon even to you And you'll better comprehend all I mean when your pure Mind meets with a Gentleman of exalted Sense like Mr  B  whom if you  find  not so good as you wish your Example will  make  so  Permit me to add for the sake of you my dear Parents as well as for those of my muchrespected Friends who have join'd in the kind Caution you give me my dear Miss against getting into too thoughtful and gloomy a way that there is no great Fear that I should continue long in it when I have so kind and so generous a Comforter as Mr  B  For at his Presence all my fearful Apprehensions are dissipated and vanish like a Morning Dream And depend upon it that so sure as the Day succeeds to the Night so sure will my Mind while capable of the least Sense of Gratitude be illuminated the Moment he shines out upon me let it be ever so overcast in his Absence thro' imaginary Doubts and apprehended Evils  I have only further to add for my Comfort that next  Thursday  Sev'nnight if nothing hinders we are to set out for  London  And why do you think I say  for my Comfort  Only that I shall then soon have the Opportunity to assure you personally as you give me Hope how much I am my dear Miss  Darnford    Your truly affectionate  PB  I will shew you when I see you the Conversation you require about the young Ladies  LETTER III  My dear Miss  ONE more Letter and I have done for a great while because I hope your Presence will put an End to the Occasion I shall now tell you of my second Visit to the Dairyhouse where we went to Breakfast in the Chariot and Four because of the Distance which is Ten pretty long Miles  I transcrib'd for you from Letters written formerly to my dear Parents an  See  Vol II  p    Account of my former Dairyhouse Visit and what the People were and whom I saw there and altho' I besought you to keep that Affair to yourself as too touching a Point to the Reputation of my Mr  B  to be known but to you only and even to destroy it when you had perused it yet I make no doubt you remember the Story and so I need not repeat any Part of that Account  When we arrived there we found at the Door expecting us for they heard the Chariotwheels at a Distance my pretty Miss  Goodwin  accompanied by two other Misses who had earned their Ride and  attended by the Governess's Daughter a discreet young Gentlewoman As soon as I stepp'd out Missran into my Arms with great Eagerness and I as tenderly embraced her and leading her into the Parlour asked her abundance of Questions about her Work and her Lessons and among the rest If she had merited this Distinction of the Chaise and Dairyhouse Breakfast or if it were owing to her Uncle's Favour and to that of her Governess The young Gentlewoman assur'd me it was to both and shew'd me Miss's Needleworks and Penmanship and the Child was highly pleased with my Commendations  I took a good deal of Notice of the other two Misses for thair Schoolfellow's sake and made each of them a Present of some little Toys and my Miss of a Number of pretty Trinkets with which she was highly delighted and I told her that I would wait upon her Governess when I came from  London  into the Country again and see in what Order she kept her little Matters for above all things I loved pretty housewisely Misses and then I would bring her more  Mr  B  observ'd with no small Satisfaction the Child's Behaviour which is very pretty and appeared as fond of her as if he had been  more  than her  Uncle  and yet seemed under some Restraint lest it should be taken that he  was  Such Power has secret Guilt poor dear Gentleman to lessen and restrain a Pleasure that would in a happier Light have been so laudable to have manifested But how commendable is this his Love to the dear Child compar'd to that of most wicked Libertines who have no Delight but in destroying Innocence and care not what becomes of the unhappy Infant or of the still more unhappy Mother  I am going to let you into a charming Scene resulting from this Perplexity of the dear Gentleman  A Scene that has afforded me high Delight ever since and always will when I think of it But I will lead to it as gradually as it happen'd  The Child was very fond of her Uncle and told him She loved him dearly and always would love and honour him for giving her such a good Aunt You talked Madam said she when I saw you before that I should come and live with you Will you let me Madam Indeed I will be very good and do every thing you bid me and mind my Book and my Needle indeed I will  Ask your Uncle my dearest Miss said I I should like your pretty Company of all things  She went to Mr  B  and said Shall I Sir go and live with my Aunt Pray let me when you come from  London  again  You have a very good Governess Miss said he and she can't part with you  Yes but she can Sir she has a great many Misses and can spare me well enough and if you please to let me ride in your Coach sometimes I can go and visit my Governess and beg a Holiday for the Misses nowandthen when I am almost a Woman and then all the Misses will love me  Don't the Misses love you now Miss  Goodwin  said he Yes they love me wellenough for matter of that but they'll love me better when I can beg them a Holiday Do dear Sir let me go home to my new Aunt next time you come into the Country  I was much pleased with the dear Child's Earnestness and permitted her to have her full Argument with her beloved Uncle but was much moved and he himself was under some Concern when the dear Miss saidBut you should in Pity let me live with you Sir for I have no Papa nor Mamma neither They are so far offBut I will love  you both as if you were my own Papa and Mamma so dear now my good Uncle promise the poor Girl that has never a Papa nor Mamma  I withdrew to the Door It will rain I believe said I and looked up And indeed I had almost a Shower in my Eye and had I kept my Place could not have refrained shewing how much I was affected  Mr  B  as I said was a little mov'd but for fear the young Gentlewoman should take notice of it How my Dear said he No Papa and Mamma Did they not send you a pretty Black Boy to wait upon you a while ago Have you forgot that That's true reply'd Miss But what's a Black Boy to living with my new AuntThat's better a great deal than a Black Boy Indeed it is  Well your Aunt and I will consider of it when we come from  London  Be a good Girl mean time and do as your Governess would have you and then you don't know what we may do for you Well then Miss  Bett  said she to her young Governess let me be set two Tasks instead of one and I will learn all I can to deserve to go to my Aunt  In this manner the little Prattler diverted herself And as we returned from them the Scene I hinted at open'd as follows  Mr  B  was pleased to say What a poor Figure does the proudest Mind make my dear  Pamela  under the Sense of a concealed Guilt in Company of the Innocent who know it and those who do not Even the casual Expression of a Baby shall strike back Shame upon a guilty Heart and make one unable to look up without Confusion I blush'd for myself continued he to see how you was affected for me and yet withdrew to avoid reproaching me so much as with your Eye for then the whole Power of Innocence triumphing over my Guilt  how like a Fool I look'd Surely I made a most contemptible Figure  Pamela  Did you not disdain me at that Moment  Dearest Sir how can you speak such a Word A Word I cannot repeat after you For at that very Time I beheld you with the more Reverence for seeing your noble Heart touch'd with a Sense of your Error and it was such an Earnest to me of the happiest Change I could ever wish for and in so young a Gentleman that it was one half Joy for that and the other half Concern at the little Charmer's accidental Plea to her best and nearest Friend for coming home to her hew Aunt that affected me so sensibly as you saw  You must not talk to me of the Child's coming home after this Visit  Pamela  for how at this rate shall I stand the Reproaches of my own Mind were I to see the little Prater every Day before me and to think of what her poor Mamma has suffered on my Account 'Tis enough that in  you  my Dear I have an hourly Reproach before me for my Attempts on your Virtue and I have nothing to boast but that I gave way to your Triumphs And what then is my Boast  What is your Boast dearest sir You have every thing to boast that is worthy of being boasted of Brought up to an affluent Fortune uncontroulable in your Will your Passions unbridled God has touched your truly noble Heart and you have seen your Error at a Time of Life when others are rushing into Vices in the midst of which perhaps they are cut off  You act generously and with a laudable Affection to a deserving Baby which some would have left friendless to the wide World and have made more miserable perhaps than they had made the very miserable Mother And you have the Comfort to  think that thro' God's Goodness this  Mother  is not unhappy and that there is not a lost  Soul  any more than a lost  Body  to lay to your Charge  You have inspirited by your generous Example and inabled by your splendid Fortune another Person whom you have made the happiest Creature in the World to do more Good if she may say so without Vanity than Twenty wicked Libertines have done Mischief besides making every one that approaches you easy and happy with the Bounty of your own Hands  You are the best of Husbands the best of Landlords the best of Masters the best of Friends and with all these Excellencies and a Mind as I hope continually improving and more and more affected with the Sense of its past Mistakes will you ask dear Sir What is your Boast  O my dearest dear Mr  B  and then I press'd his Hand with my Lips whatever you are to yourself when you give way to Reflections so hopeful you are the Glory and the Boast of your grateful  Pamela  And permit me to add Tears standing in my Eyes and holding his Hand between mine That I never beheld you in my Life in a more amiable Light than when I saw your manly Countenance manifesting the Struggle your Heart labour'd with as it seem'd to me between Grace and Consciousness O Sir this was a Sight of Joy of true Joy to one who loves you for your dear Soul's sake more than for that of your Person and who looks forward to a Companionship with you beyond the Term of this transitory Life  The dear Gentleman look'd down sometimes and sometimes upon me without offering to interrupt me and when I had done speaking I began to fear by his Silence that I had offended him remembering  just then one of his former  See  Vol II  p    Cautions to me not to throw a Gloom by my Overseriousness upon his innocent Injoyments and I said putting my Arms round his Arm as I fat my fearful Eye watching his I fear Sir I have been too serious I have perhaps broken one of your Injunctions Have cast a Gloominess over your Mind And if I have dear Sir forgive me  He clasped his Arm around me O my beloved  Pamela  said he thou dear Augmenter of my Honour and Confirmer of all my better Purposes how shall I acknowlege for reward I never can your inexpressible Goodness to me I see every Day more and more my dear Love what Confidence I may repose in your Generosity and Discretion You want no Forgiveness and my Silence was owing to much better Motives than to those you were apprehensive of  Judge ye my honoured Parents and you my dear Miss the Joy that overspread my Heart incouraged in a manner so agreeable to all my Wishes O Sir Sir said I after a short Pause your Goodness had struck me dumb for a Moment but my Silence could hold but for that Moment For had I been naturally dumb and never spoken before my Joy for this your Kindness and the futute Hope you raise in my Breast would have unbarr'd the Doors of my Speech or my Heart would have been made vocal had my Tongue remained silent  Forgive me my dearest Miss these slightly Expressions I know they are above myself and perhaps out of Nature but so in a manner was your Friend when she spoke them If ever it be your Lot to marry such a Gentleman as Mr  B  one Who is capable of generous and noble Sentiments and  yet has not been so good as you wish him to be whenever it shall happen that the Divine Grace and your Example shall touch his Heart and awaken his better Faculties you'll then know a Joy like this which I have described which will not only exalt your Heart and Speech but upon Reflection will irradiate many a gloomy Apprehension that at times will cast a Shadow over the brightest and happiest Prospects  The Chariot brought us home sooner than I wished and Mr  B  handed me into the Parlour Here Mrs  Jervis  said he meeting her in the Passage receive your AngelLady I must take a little Tour without you  Pamela  for I have had  too much  of your dear Company and must leave you to descend again into myself for you have raised me to such a Pitch that it is with Pain I bear it  He kissed my Hand and went into his Chariot again for it was but half an Hour after Twelve and said he would be back by Two at Dinner He left Mrs  Jervis  wondering at his Words and at the solemn Air with which he utter'd them But when I told that good Friend the Occasion I had a new Joy in the Pleasure and Gratulations of the dear good Woman on what had passed  Were I my dear Friends to recount to you every Conversation that gives me Delight when we are  alone  my Miss  Darnford  as well as when we are in Company I should do nothing but write Imagine the rest from what I have but as so many Specimens of my Felicity informed you of and then think if there can possibly be a happier Creature on Earth than I am at present  My next Letter will be from  London  and to you my honoured Parents for to you my dear Miss I shall not write again expecting to see you soon But I must now write seldomer because I am to  renew my Correspondence with Lady  Davers  with whom I cannot be so free as I have been with Miss  Darnford  and so I doubt my dear Father and Mother you cannot have the Particulars of that Correspondence for I shall never find Time to transcribe But every Opportunity that offers you may assure yourself shall be laid hold of by  Your everdutiful Daughter  P B  Excuse me dear Miss a second Subscription for you need not be told how much I am and ever shall be  Your affectionate  P B  LETTER IV  My dear Father and Mother  I Know you will be pleased to hear that we arrived safely in Town last Night We found a stately wellfurnish'd and convenient House and I had my Closet or Library and my Withdrawingroom all in complete Order which Mr  B  gave me Possession of in a manner the most obliging that can be imagined  I am in a new World as I may say and see such vast Piles of Building everywhere and such a Concourse of People and hear such a Rattling of Coaches in the Day that I hardly know what to make of it as yet Then the nightly Watch going their hourly Rounds disturbed me last Night But I shall soon be us'd to that and sleep the sounder perhaps for the Security it assures to us  Mr  B  is impatient to shew me what is curious in and about this vast City and to hear as he is pleased to say my Observations upon what I shall see and he has carried me thro' several of the fine Streets this Day in his Chariot But at present I have too confused a Notion of Things to give any Account of them Nor shall I trouble you with Descriptions of that kind for you being within a Day's Journey of  London  I hope for the Pleasure of seeing you oftener than I could expect before and shall therefore leave these Matters to your own Observations and what you'll hear from others  I am impatient for the Arrival of my dear Miss  Darnford  whose Company and Conversation will reconcile me in a great measure to this new World  Our Family at present are Mr  Colbrand  Mr  Jonathan  and six Menservants including the Coachman The four Maids are also with us  But my good Mrs  Jervis  was indisposed so came not up with us but we expect her and Mr  Longman  in a Day or two For Mr  B  has given her to my Wishes and  Arthur  the Gardener and his Wife with  Benjamin  are to keep House in the Country And as Mr  Longman  's Business will require him to be up and down frequently Mrs  Jervis  's Care will be the better dispens'd with there and I long to see the dear good Woman and shall be more in my Element when I do  Then I have besides my penitent  Polly Barlow  But the poor Girl has never held up her Head since that deplorable Instance of her Weakness which I mentioned to you and Miss  Darnford  yet am I as kind to her as if nothing had happen'd I wish however some good Husband would offer for her  Mr  Adams  our worthy Chaplain is at present with Mr  Williams  He purposes to give us his Company here till  Christmas  when Matters will be adjusted  probably so that he can take Possession of his Living Mean time that we may not let fall a good Custom when perhaps we shall have most Occasion for it I make Mr  Jonathan  who is reverend by his Years and silver Hairs supply his Place appointing him the Subjects  God preserve you both in Health and continue to me I beseech you your Prayers and Blessings concludes me  Your everdutiful Daughter  P B  LETTER V From Mrs  B  to Lady  Davers    My dearest Lady  I Must beg Pardon for having been in this great Town more than a Week and not having found an Opportunity to tender my Devoirs to your Ladyship You know dear Madam what Hurries and Fatigues must attend such a Journey to one in my way and to an intire new Settlement in which an hundred things must be done and attended to with a Preference to other Occasions however delightful Yet I must own we found a stately a wellorder'd and a convenient House But although it is not far from Fields and has an airy Opening to its back Part and its Front a Square as it is called yet I am not reconcil'd to it so intirely as to the beloved Mansion we left  My dear Mr  B  has been and is busily imploy'd in ordering some few Alterations to make things still more commodious He has furnish'd me out a little pretty Library and has allotted me very  convenient Apartments besides And the Furniture of every Place is rich as befits the Mind and Fortune of the generous Owner But I shall not offer at Particulars because we hope to have the Honour of a Visit from my good Lord and your Ladyship before the Winter Weather sets in to make the Roads too dirty and deep but it is proper to mention that the House is so large that we make a great Number of Beds the more conveniently to receive the Honours your Ladyship and my Lord and Mr  B  's other Friends will do us  I have not yet been at any of the publick Diversions Mr  B  has carry'd me by gentle Turns out of his Workmens way Ten Miles round this overgrown Capital and through the principal of its numerous Streets The Villages that lie spangled about this vast Circumference as well on the other Side the noble  Thames  which I had before a Notion of from Sir  John Denbam  's celebrated  Cooper's Hill  as well as on the  Middlesex  Side are beautiful both by Buildings and Situation beyond what I could conceive and several of them seem larger than many of our Country Towns of Note But it would be impertinent to trouble your Ladyship with these Matters who are no Stranger to what is worthy of Notice in  London  But I was surpris'd when Mr  B  observed to me that this whole County and the Two Cities of  London  and  Westminster  are represented by no more than Eight Members of Parliament when so many Borough Towns in  England  are inferior to the meanest Villages about  London    I am in daily Expectation of the Arrival of Miss  Darnford  and then I shall wish accompanied by a young Lady of so polite a Taste to see a good Play Mr  B  has already shewn me the Operahouse and the Two Playhouses tho' silent as I may say that as he was pleased to observe they should not be  new to me and that the Sight might not take off my Attention to the Performance when I went to the Play So that I can conceive a tolerable Notion of every thing from the Disposition of the Seats the Boxes the Galleries the Pit the Musick the Scenes and the Stage and so shall have no Occasion to gaze about me like a Country Novice whereby I might attract a Notice that I should not with either for my own Credit or your dear Brother's Honour  I have had a Pleasure which I wished for and had not in  Bedfordshire  and that is that on  Sunday  I was at Church without gaping Crouds to attend us and Wishes too loud for my own Yet I was more gaz'd at and so was Mr  B  than I expected considering there were so many welldress'd Gentry and some Nobility there and  they  star'd as much as any body but will not do so I hope when we cease to be a Novelty  We have already had several Visitors to welcome Mr  B  to Town and to congratulate him on his Marriagebut some no doubt to see and to find Fault with his Rustick for it is impossible you know Madam that a Gentleman so distinguish'd by his Merit and Fortune should have taken a Step of such Consequence to himself and Family and not be known by every body so to have done  Sir  Thomas Atkyns  is in Town and has taken Apartments in the newbuilt stately Pile of Edifices called  Hanoversquare  and he brought with him a younger Brother of Mr  Arthur  's who it seems is a Merchant  Lord  F  has been to pay his Respects to Mr  B  likewise whose Schoolfellow he was  Eaton  the little time Mr  B  was there His Lordship promises that his Lady shall make me a Visit and accompany me to the Opera as soon as we are fully settled  A Gentleman of the  Temple  Mr  Turner  by Name and Mr  Fanshaw  of  Grey'sInn  both Lawyers and of Mr  B  's former Acquaintance very sprightly and modish Gentlemen have also welcom'd us to Town and made Mr  B  abundance of gay Compliments on my account to my Face all in the common frothy Run  They may be polite Gentlemen but I can't say I overmuch like themThere is something so forward so opinionated so seemingly insensible of Rebuke either from  within  or  without  and yet not promising to avoid deserving one occasionally that I could as  lieve  wish Mr  B  and they would not renew their former Acquaintance  I am very bold your Ladyship will sayBut you command me to write freely Yet I would not he thought to be uneasy with regard to your dear Brother's Morals from these Gentlemen for Oh Madam I am a blessed Creature and am hourly happier and happier in the Confidence I have as to that Particular But I imagine they will force themselves upon him more than he himself may wish or would permit were the Acquaintance now to begin for they are not of his Turn of Mind as it seems to me being by a Sentence or two that dropt from them very free and very frothy in their Conversation and by their laughing at what they say themselves taking that for Wit which will not stand the Test if I may be allow'd to say so  But they have heard no doubt what a Character Mr  B  's Goodness to me has lifted into Notice and they think themselves warranted to say any thing before his Country Girl  He was pleased to ask me when they were gone How I liked his two Lawyers And said they were Persons of Family and Fortune  I am glad of it Sir said I for their own sakes  Then you don't approve of them  Pamela    They are  your  Friends Sir and I cannot have any Dislike to them  They say good Things  sometimes  returned he  I don't doubt it Sir But you say good Things  always    'Tis happy for me my Dear you think so But tell me What think you of 'em  I shall be better able Sir to answer your Question if I see them a second time  But we form Notions of Persons at first Sight sometimes my Dear and you are seldom mistaken in yours  I only think Sir That they have neither of them any Diffidence But their Profession perhaps may set them above that  They don't  practise  my Dear their Fortunes require it not of them and they are too studious of their Pleasures to give themselves any Trouble they are not oblig'd to take  They seem to me Sir to be  qualified  for Prastice They would make great Figures at the Bar I fansy  Why so  Because Sir they seem if I  must  speak Gentlemen of great Elocution  How do you discover that my Dear  Only that they seem prepared to think  well  of what they shall say  themselves  and  lightly  of what  other People  say or may think of  them    That indeed my Dear is the necessary Character of a publick Speaker be he Lawyer or what he will The Man who cannot doubt himself and can judge contemptibly of his Auditors never fails to speak with  Selfapplause  at least  But you'll pardon me good Sir for speaking my Mind so freely and so early of these  your Friends    I never my Love ask you a Question I wish you not to answer and always expect your Answer should be without Reserve for many times I may ask your Opinion as a Corrective or a Confirmation of my own Judgment  How kind how indulgent was this my good LadyBut you know how generously your dear Brother treats me on all Occasions and this makes me so bold as I often am  It may be necessary my dear Lady to give you an Account of our Visitors in order to make the future Parts of my Writing the more intelligible because what I may have to write may turn sometimes upon the Company we see For which Reason I shall also just mention Sir  George Stuart  a  Scotish  Gentleman with whom Mr  B  came acquainted in his Travels who seems to be a polite and Mr  B  says is a learned Man and a Virtuoso He and a Nephew of his of the same Name a bashful Gentleman and who for that Reason I imagine has a Merit that lies deeper than a first Observation can reach are just gone from us and were received with so much Civility by Mr  B  as intitles them to my respectful Regard  Thus Madam do I run on in a manner without Materials and only to shew you the Pleasure I take in obeying you I hope my good Lord  Davers  continues in Health and me in his Favour which I value extremely as well as your Ladyship's Mr  H  I hope likewise enjoys his Health But let me not forget my particular and thankful Respects to the Countess for her Ladyship's Favour and Goodness to me which I shall ever place next in my grateful Esteem to the Honours I have received from your Ladyship on so many Occasions and which bind me to be with the greatest Respect my dear Lady  Your faithful and obliged Servant  P B  LETTER VI  My dear Father and Mother  I Write to you both at this time for your Advice in a particular Case that is the only one that I have had or I hope ever shall have with my dear Benefactor by way of Dispute and as he is pleased to insist upon his way and it is a Point of Conscience with me I must resolve I think to be determin'd by your joint Advice and if my Father and Mother and Husband are of one Opinion I must yield up my own  This is the Subject I think a Mother ought if she can to be the Nurse to her own Children  Mr  B  says he will not permit it  It is the first  will not  I have heard from him or given Occasion for And I tell him that as it is a Point of Conscience with me I hope he will indulge me But the dear Gentleman has an odd way of arguing that sometimes puzzles me He pretends to answer me from Scripture but I have some Doubts of  his  Exposition and he gives me Leave to write to you tho' yet he won't promise to be determin'd by your Opinions if they are not the same with his own and I say to him Is this fair my dearest Mr  B  Is it  He has got the Dean's Opinion with him for our Debate began before we came to Town But then he would not let me state the Case but did it himself and yet 'tis but an half Opinion as I may say neither For it is That if the Husband is set upon it it is a Wife's Duty to obey  But I can't see how that is for if it be the  natural  Duty of a Mother it is a  Divine  Duty and  how can a Husband have Power to discharge a Divine DutyAs great as a Wife's Obligation is to obey her Husband which is I own one Indispensable of the Marriage Contract it ought not to interfere with what one takes to be a superior Duty And must not one be one's own Judge of Actions by which we must stand or fall  I'll tell you my Plea  I say That where a Mother is unhealthy subject to communicative Distempers as scrophulous or scorbutick or consumptive Disorders which have infected the Blood or Lungs or where they have not Plenty of Nourishment for the Child as I have heard is the Case of some that in these Cases a Dispensation lies of course  But where there is good Health free Spirits and plentiful Nourishment I think it an indispensable Duty  For this was the Custom of old of all the good Wives we read of in Scripture  Then the Nourishment of the Mother must be most natural to the Child  Then a Nurse may have a bad Husband may have Distempers may have private Vices as to Liquors  c  may be careless and a Selflover while a Mother prefers the Health of her Child to her own private Satisfactions or Appetites  A Nurse may be of a sordid Nature and when I have heard Mr  B  so satirical on Lords and Gentlemen in Coachboxes why may not Charity make one think that the Lady of the Family was innocent of sordid and unpardonable Crimes imputed by severe Judges and that the Child when grown up owes its Taste to the Coachbox to its Nurse's being the Coachman's Wife or the Wife of one of like  Degree who may not have a Mind or Qualities above that Degree for as the Blood and Spirits are augmented with the Child's Growth by the Food it takes in a sordid Nature may as well be communicated from a sound Woman as bad Health by an unsound as I should imagine  Then the Child by the Designation of Nature generally brings its Nourishment into the World with it And Art must be used as I presume to dry up the Fountains of such its Nourishment And is not this quite unnatural  And is not what is unnatural sinful  Then I have lately read my Circumstances having made me curious on this Subject that a newborn Child has in its little Bowels a pitchy Substance that wants to be purged off and when it is not occasions those Gripings and Convulsions which destroy so many miserable Infants even as one finds by the weekly Bills here in Town more than half of those who die in Infancy Whereas Nature has design'd it seems a Cure for this in the purgative Quality and fine thin Blueness given to the first Milk which in three Weeks or a Month or may be less carries off that pitchy Substance and gives Freedom and Ease to the Bowels of Babies a Quality which not being in staler Milk the poor Child often falls a Sacrifice to this Negligence or Inattention and the Mother's Pains and Hazards are all cast away and her Griefs at losing the dear Infant are much greater than her Joys at its Birth when all the Danger was over  Then dear Sir said I there is another Point respecting the Health of our SexGreat Hurts to one's Constitution may arise from too frequently  being in this Circumstance and for my own Part you have made me so happy that I cannot help being  covetous  of Life if I may so sayBut the Sin dear Sir the Sin of committing that Task to others which is so right to be performed by one's self if one has Health and Strength to perform it is the chief thing with me and you know Sir that even a Husband's Will is not sufficient to excuse one from a natural or divine Obligation  These were my Pleas among others And this is his Answer for he was so good to give it me in writing  "As to what you allege my Dear of old Customs Times and Fashions are much changed If you tell me of  Sarah  's or  Rachel  's or  Rebekah  's or  Leah  's nursing their own Children I can answer that the one drew Water at a Well for her Father's Flocks another kneaded Cakes and baked them on the Hearth for her Guests another personally dress'd savoury Meat for her Husband and all of them performed the common Offices of the Houshold And when our modern Ladies are willing to follow such Examples in  every thing  their Plea ought to be allow'd in this  "As to the matter of sordid NaturesWe read that there were among  Jacob  's twelve Sons bad as well as good Natures tho' born of and nursed by the same Mothers  Reuben  particularly committed an unpardonable Crime You are too well read in Scripturehistory to need being told what it was Two others were Murderers treacherous Murderers in cold Blood and how did all their Hearts burn with sordid and unbrotherly Envy against their Father's favourite Son  "Then it requires but the more Care in finding out a wholsome Woman who has an honest and goodnatur'd Husband And let me tell you  Pamela  that the best Natures and the best Constitutions tho' your Case is an Exception are not always to be met with in Highlife and the less perhaps because they don't exercise themselves as the patriarchal Nurses you hinted at used to do Indeed I have seen Spirits in some of the Highborn of your Sex that one would not wish to be propagated but contrarily if there be so much in the Nature of the Nourishment I should think it matter of Prudence that the Child should have any other Nurse than its Mother  "As to the Nurse's private Vices with regard to Liquors Distempers  c  this will be answer'd by what I have hinted of the greater Care to be taken in the Choice of the Nurse And I am so well pleased with your Apprehensions of this Nature that it is a moral Security to me that you will make a proper Choice and I shall be intirely easy in committing this Province to so prudent and discreet a Wife  "I allow that there is a great deal in what you say as to the pitchy Substance in newborn Children and I think it very proper that the Child should have the first Milk But cannot such a Nurse be found as may answer this Intention If she cannot I will provided you deal by me with your usual Sincerity and not make Scruples against a Recommendation on purpose to carry your own Point permit you to be your own Nurse for one Month or so if by the Opinion of proper Judges it be found necessary But then as I know the pretty wiredrawing ways of your Sex you must not so much as ask to go farther for I shall not care to have my Rest  disturbed and it may not be quite so well perhaps to lay us under the Necessity of separate Beds  "Besides my Fondness for your personal Graces and the laudable and I will say honest Pleasure I take in that easy genteel Form which every body admires in you at first Sight oblige me to declare that I can by no means consent to sacrifice these to the Carelessness into which I have seen very nice Ladies sink when they became Nurses Moreover my chief Delight in you is for the Beauties of your Mind and unequall'd as they are in my Opinion you have still a Genius capable of great Improvement and I shan't care when I want to hear my  Pamela  read her  French  and  Latin  Lessons which I take so much Delight to teach her and to endeavour to improve myself from her Virtue and Piety at the same time to seek my Beloved in the Nursery or to permit her to be ingross'd by those Baby Offices which will better befit weaker Minds  "No my Dear you must allow me to look upon you as my Scholar in one Sense as my Companion in another and as my Instructress in a third You know I am not govern'd by the worst Motives I am half overcome by your Virtue and you must take care that you leave not your Work halfdone But I cannot help looking upon the Nurse's Office as an Office beneath my  Pamela  Let it have your Inspection your Direction and your sole Attention if you please when I am abroad But when I am at home even a Son and Heir so jealous am I of your Affections shall not be my Rival in them Nor will I have my Rest broken in upon by your Servants bringing to you as you once propos'd your dear Littleone at Times perhaps as  unsuitable to my Repose and your own as to the Child's Necessities for I have no Notion of stifling even a Cry by cramming its little Stomach when that very Cry shall perhaps be necessary for Exercise to its Lungs and to open its little Organs  "You have been often somewhat uneasy when I have talked for Argument's sake in favour of Polygamy But when you mention the Designations of Nature and form from thence your Notions of Duty on this Subject what will you say if I could from your very Arguments of this kind plead for that Practice and bring all your good patriarchal Folks on my side on whom you lay such Stress in one InstanceFor Example my Dear Suppose I put you in mind that while  Rachel  was giving her Littleone all her Attention as a good Nurse the worthy Patriarch had several other WivesDon't be shock'd my dearest LoveThe Laws of one's own Country are a sufficient Objection to me against Polygamy at least I will not think of any more Wives till you convince me by your Adherence to the Example given you by the Patriarch Wives that I ought to follow those of the Patriarch Husbands"  So here is that nasty Word  Polygamy  again Mr  B  knows I had rather he should mention any thing than thatBut be so good as to mind his next Argument He is pleased to entertain very high Notions tho' he puts them not in Practice and indeed I think it my Duty to avoid giving him Occasion for it of the Prerogative'of a Husband Upon my Word he sometimes for Argument's sake makes a body think a Wife should not have the least Will of her own He sets up a dispensing Power in short altho' he knows that  that Doctrine once cost a Prince his Crown And thus proceeding with his Answer to my Plea he argues  "The chief Thing that sticks with you my dear  Pamela  is that you think it unnatural in a Mother not to be a Nurse to her own Child if she can and what is unnatural you say is a Sin Now my Dear altho' your  Practice  be so unexceptionable you seem not to have a right Notion of the Obedience which a Wife naturally  owes  as well as voluntarily  vows  to a Husband's Will  "In all  lawful  Things you'll sayBut suppose my Dear you were to make a solemn Vow either as a single Woman or as a Wife to do any thing that you had a natural Power to do No doubt you would think yourself under an Obligation to perform it let the Consequence be what it would But to shew  you  who are so learned in the old Law of how little Force even the  Vows  of your Sex are and how much you are under the Controul of ours read the following Verses in  Numbers  xxx  If a  MAN  vow a Vow unto the Lord or swear an Oath to bind his Soul with a Bond he shall not break his Word he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his Mouth  The Reason of this is he is sole and independent and Master of his own Will and ActionsBut what follows  If a  WOMAN  also vow a Vow unto the Lord and bind herself by a Bond being in her Father's House in her Youth and her Father hear her Vow and her Bond wherewith she hath bound her Soul and her Father shall hold his Peace at her Then all her Vows shall stand and every Bond wherewith she hath bound her Soul shall stand But if her Father disallow her in the Day that he heareth not any of her Vows or of her Bonds wherewith she hath bound her Soul shall  stand And the Lord shall forgive her because her Father disallowed her  "The very same Thing is with equal Strength expressed in the Verses immediately following in relation to a HUSBAND'S allowing or disallowing his WIFE's Vows nor is it distinguish'd at all whether the Vow be just or unjust And it is worthy of Observation too that the Laws of  England  in Consideration of the Obedience a Wife owes to a Husband will acquit a WOMAN of certain Crimes for which they will punish a MAN with Death  "What I have mentioned therefore shews how much the  Daughter  is under the absolute Controul of her  Father  and the  Wife  of her  Husband  So that you see my Dear even in such a strong Point as  solemn Vow to the Lord  the Wife may be absolv'd by the Husband from the Performance of it  "And by the way this is no bad Piece of Information to young Ladies who are urged by their designing Lovers to enter into Vows and Contracts in their Favour Not one of which you see is of Force unless the Father and by the same Rule those who have Authority over her and stand in the Father's Place approve and confirm it  "If this therefore be the Case in so solemn a Point surely an Husband may take upon himself to dispense with such a supposed Obligation as that which you seem so loth to give up even although you had made a Vow that you would nurse your own ChildAnd the rather if the Principle an Husband acts upon is laudable a Desire to continue his affectionate and faithful Regards to his Wife to preserve in her as long as may be preserved those Graces and those Delicacies of Person which he admires in  her and which it is impossible a thorough Nurse should keep up and as moreover in your Case her Time may be imploy'd to so much greater Improvement to her own Mind and her Husband's Morals while he can look upon her in a Light above that of an insipid prattling Nurse who must become a Fool and a Baby herself before she can be complete in the Character into which you my Dear want to dwindle  "Some Gentlemen may be fond of having their Ladies undertake this Province and very good Reasons may be assigned for such their Fondness but it suits not me at all And yet no Man would be thought to have a greater Affection for Children than myself or be more desirous to do them Justice for I think every one should look forward to Posterity with a Preference But if my  Pamela  can be  better  impoy'd If the Office can be equally well perform'd If your Direction and Superintendence will be sufficient and if I cannot look upon you in that way with equal Delight as if it was otherwise I insist upon it my  Pamela  that you acquiesce with my  Dispensation  and don't think to let me lose my beloved Wife and have an indelicate Nurse put upon me instead of her  "As to that Hint the nearest to me of all of Dangers to your Constitution there is as much Reason to hope it may  not  be so as to fear that it  may  For Children sometimes bring Health with them as well as Infirmity and it is not a little likely that the  Nurse  's Office may affect the Health of a dear Lady who has no very robust Constitution and thinks it so much her Duty to attend it that she will abridge herself of half the Pleasures of Life and on that Account confine herself within Doors or in the other Case must  take with her her Infant and her Nurserymaid whereever she goes and I shall either have very fine Company shall I not or be obliged to deny myself yours  "Then as I propose to give you a Smattering of the  French  and  Italian  I know not but I may take you with me on a little Tour into  France  and  Italy  at least to  Bath  to  Tunbridge  to  Oxford  to  York  and the principal Places of  England  Wherefore as I love to look upon you as the Companion of my Pleasures I advise you my dearest Love not to weaken or to speak in a Phrase proper to the present Subject  wean  me from that Love  to  you and Admiration  of  you which hitherto has been rather increasing than otherwise as your Merit and Regard for me have increased"  These my dear Parents are charming Allurements almost irresistible Temptations And that makes me mistrust myself the more and be the more diffidentFor we are but too apt to be persuaded into any thing when the Motives are so tempting as these lastBut do you take it  indeed  that a Husband has such a vast Prerogative Can it be now under the  Gospel  that this setting themselves as it were in God's place and  dispensing  with our Wills as pleases theirs is still in ForceYet it is said that our Saviour came not to  break the Law but to fulfil it    I take it for granted that many Ladies will not chuse to dispute this Point so earnestly as I have done for we have had several little Debates about it and it is the only Point I have ever yet debated with him But one would not be altogether implicit neither It is no Compliment to him to be quite passive and to have no Will at all of one's own Yet would I not dispute one Point but in Supposition of a superior  Obligation And this he says he can  dispense  with But alas my dear Mr  B  was never yet thought so intirely fit to fill up the Character of a Casuistical Divine as that one may absolutely rely upon his Decisions in these serious Points And you know we must all stand or fall by our own Judgments  Upon Condition therefore that he requires not to see this my Letter nor your Answer to it unless I please I write for your Advice for you both have always made a Conscience of your Duties and taught me to do so too or perhaps I had not been what I am and I know morever that nobody is more conversant with the Scriptures than you are and some how or other he has got the Dean against me and I care not to be so free with the worthy Minister of our Parish here and still less with the younger Clergymen I am acquainted with  But this I see plainly enough that he will have his own Way and if I cannot get over my Scruples what shall I do For if I think it a  Sin  to submit to the Dispensation he insists upon as in his Power to grant and yet  do  submit to it what will become of my Peace of Mind For it is not in our Power to believe as one will Then weak Minds will have their Doubts and the Law allows a Toleration for scrupulous and tender Consciences But my beloved Husband my Lawgiver and my Prince I doubt will allow none to poor me  As to the Liberty he gives me for a Month I should be loth to take it for one does not know the Inconveniences that may attend a Change of Nourishment or if I did I should ratherBut I know not what I would say for I am but a young Creature to be in this Way and very unequal to it in every respect So I commit myself to God's Direction and your Advice as becomes  Your everdutiful Daughter  P B  LETTER VII  My dearest Child  YOUR Mother and I have as well considered the Case you put as we are able and we think your own Reasons very good and it is pity a thousand Pities your honoured Husband will not allow them as you my Dear make it such a Point with you Very few Ladies would give their Spouses we believe the Trouble of this Debate and few Gentlemen are so very nice as yours in this respect for I but what signifies what such a mean Soul as I think compar'd to so learned and brave a Gentleman yet I always thought your dear Mother and she has been a pretty Woman too in her Time never look'd so lovely as when I saw the dear Creature like the  Pelican  in the Wilderness feeding her young ones from her kind BreastAnd had I had ever so noble an Estate I am sure I should have thought so  But since the good 'Squire cannot take this Pleasure since he so much values your Person since he gives you Warning that it may estrange his Affections since he is impatient of Denial and thinks so highly of his Prerogative since he may if disobliged resume some bad Habits and so you may have all your Prayers and Hopes in his perfect Reformation frustrated and find your own Power to do Good more narrow'd as I may say we think besides the Obedience you have vowed to him and is the Duty of every good Wife you ought to give up the Point and acquiesce for this seemeth to us to be the lesser Evil and God Almighty if it should be your Duty will not be less merciful than  Men who as his Honour says by the Laws of the Realm excuse a Wife when she is faulty by the Command of the Husband and we hope the Fault he is pleased to make you commit if a Fault for he really gives very praiseworthy Motives for his Dispensation will not lie at his own Door So e'en resolve my dearest Child to submit to it and with Chearfulness too  God send you an happy Hour but who knows when the Time comes whether it may not be proper to dispense with this Duty as you deem it on other Accounts for every young Person is not inabled to perform it So to shew his Honour that you will chearfully acquiesce your dear Mother advises that you would look out for a wholsome goodhumour'd honest Body as near your Complexion and Temper and Constitution as may be and it may not be the worse she thinks if she is Twenty or One or Twoandtwenty for she will have more Strength and Perfection as one may say than even you can have at your tender Age And above all for the wife Reason you give from your Reading that she may be brought tobed much about your Time if it be possibleWe will look out if you please about us for such an one And as Mr  B  is not averse to have the dear Child in the House with you you will have as much Delight and the dear Baby may fare as well under your prudent and careful Eye as if you were to be obliged in the Way you would chuse  So God direct you my dearest Child in all your Ways and make you acquiesce in this Point with Chearfulness altho' as you say one cannot believe as one pleases for we verily are of Opinion you safely may at Matters stand and continue to you and your beloved and honoured Husband Health  and all manner of Happiness are the Prayers of  Your most affectionate Father and Mother  J and E ANDREWS  I have privately shew'd our worthy Minister your Letter You know my Dear he is a learned and judicious Gentleman And he is of our Opinion that it is best for you on all Accounts to acquiesce Besides it may disoblige the 'Squire and it will signify nothing after all for he will have his Way that's sure enough  LETTER VIII  I Thank you my dearest Parents for your kind Letter it was given to Mr  B  and he brought it to me himself and was angry at me Indeed he was as you shall hear  'Tis from the good Couple my Dear I see I hope they are of my Opinion But whether they be or notBut I will leave you and do you  Pamela  step down to my Closet when you have perus'd it  He was pleased to withdraw and I read it and sat down and consider'd it well but as you know I made it always my Maxim to do that I could not avoid to do with as good a Grace as possible I waited on the dear Gentleman  Well  Pamela  said he a little seriously what say the worthy Pair  Oh Sir they declare for you They say it is best for me to yield up this Point  They are certainly in the rightBut were you not a dear little perverse Slut to give me all this Trouble about your saucy Scruples  Nay Sir don't call them so said I little thinking he was displeased with meI still am somewhat wavering tho' they advise me to acquiesce And as it is your Will and you have determined how it shall be it is my Duty to yield up the Point  But do you yield it up chearfully my Dear  I do Sir and will never more dispute it let what will happenAnd I beg Pardon for having so often enter'd into this Subject with youBut you know Sir if a Body's Weakness of Mind gives one Scruples one should not yield implicitly till they are satisfy'd for that would look as if one gave you not the Obedience of a free Mind  You are very obliging  just now  my Dear But I can tell you you had made me half serious yet I would not shew it in Compliment to your present  Circumstance  for I did not expect that you would have thought  any  Appeal necessary tho' to your Father and Mother in a Point that I was determin'd upon as you must see every Time we talk'd of it  This struck me all in a Heap I look'd down to the Ground having no Courage to look up to his Face for fear I should behold his Aspect as mortifying to me as his Words But he took both my Hands and drew me kindly to him and saluted meExcuse me my dearest Love I am not angry with youSpeak to me my Dear Why drops this precious Pearl and kiss'd my Cheek Speak to me  Pamela    I will SirI willas soon as I canfor this being my first Check so seriously given my Heart was full But as I knew he would be angry and think me obstinate if I did not speak I said full  of ConcernI wish SirI wishyou had been pleased to spare me longer a little longer for the same kind very kind Consideration  But is it not better my Dear to tell you I  was  a little out of Humour than that I  am  But you had been very earnest with me on this Point more than once and you put me upon a hated because an ungenerous Necessity of pleading my Prerogative as I call it And yet this would not do but you would appeal against me in the Point I was determin'd upon for Reasons altogether generous and in your Favour and if this was not like my  Pamela  excuse me my dearest Love that I could not help being a little unlike myself  Ah thought I this is not so very unlike your dear Self if I were to give the least Shadow of an Occasion for it is of a Piece with your Lessons formerly  See  Vol II  p    c    I am sure said I I was not in the least aware that I had offendedBut I was too little circumspect I had been used to your Goodness for so long a Time that I expected it it seems and thought I was sure of your favourable Construction  Why so you may be my Dear in every thing  almost  But I don't love to speak  Ibid  p    twice my Mind on the same Subject you know I don't and you have really disputed this Point with me Five or Six times Insomuch that I wonder'd what was come to my Dearest  I thought Sir you would have distinguish'd between a Command where my Conscience was concerned and a common Point You know Sir I never had any Will but yours in common Points But indeed you make me fearful because my  Task is render'd too difficult for my own weak Judgment But then SirBut I shall offend again  And then what Say all you would say  Pamela  And then what  Why Sir if I must speakYou threaten me so at every Turn with that cruel Word  Polygamy  that it shews me it is too much in your Mind But I shall make you angry again  Was not the Patriarch Husbands Practice  Pamela  a fit Thing to be oppos'd to that of the Patriarch Wives But do you say I  threaten  you with that Word Take care my Love You have been a  faultless Angel  hitherto Don't let me find you ready to make such harsh Constructions as a  mere Woman  is accustom'd to make when she is dispos'd to be captious altho' a better Construction lies before her  I was silent but by my Tears  Now I doubt  Pamela  your Spirit is high You won't speak because you are out of Humour at what I say I will have no sullen Reserves my Dearest What means that heaving Sob I know my dear Love that this is a Time with your Sex when sadden'd with your Apprehensions and indulged because of them by the fond Husband it is needful for both their sakes to watch over the Changes of their Temper For Ladies in your Way are often like incroaching Subjects They are apt to extend what they call their Privileges on the Indulgence shewed them and the Husband never again recovers the Ascendant he had before  You know these Things better than I Mr  B  But I had no Intention to invade your Province or go out of my own Yet I thought I had a Right to a little Freewill a very little especially on some greater Occasions  Why so you have my Dear But you must not plead one Text of Scripture in Behalf of your own Will and refuse to another its due Weight when it makes for mine  Well Sir I must needs say I have one Advantage above others of my Sex For if Wives in my Circumstance are apt to grow upon Indulgence I am very happy that your kind and watchful Care will hinder me from falling into that Danger  He gave me a kind Tap on the Neck Let me beat my beloved Sawcebox said he Is it thus you railly my watchful Care over you for your own Good But tell me truly  Pamela  are you not a little sullen Look up to me my DearAre you not  I believe I am but 'tis but a very little SirIt will soon go offPlease to let me withdraw that I may take myself to Task about itfor at present I know not what to do because I did not expect the Displeasure I have incurr'd  Is it not the same Thing reply'd he if this our first Quarrel end here without your withdrawing I forgive you heartily my  Pamela  and give me one Kiss and I will think of your saucy Appeal against me no more  I will comply with your Conditions dear Sir but I have a great Mind to be saucy I wish you would let me for this once  What would you say my Dearest Be saucy then as you call it as saucy as you can  Why then Sir I am a little sullen at present that I amAnd I am not fully convinc'd whether it must be I that forgive you or you me For indeed till I can recollect I cannot think my Fault so great in this Point that was a Point of Conscience to me as pardon me Sir to stand in need of your Forgiveness  Well then my Dearest said he clasping his kind Arms about me we will forgive another but take this with you That it is my Love to you that makes me more delicate than otherwise I should be and you have inur'd me so much to a faultless Conduct that I can hardly bear with natural Infirmities from youBut giving me another Tap Get you gone I leave you to your Recollection and let me know what Fruits it produces for I must not be put off with a Halfcompliance I must have your whole  Will  with me if possible  So I went up and recollecting every thing  sacrific'd to my Sex  as Mr  B  calls it when he talks of a Wife's Reluctance to give up a favourite Point for I shed a good many Tears because my Heart was set upon it and this Patriarchal Retort hung heavy upon my Mind  And so my dear Father and Mother Twenty charming Ideas and Pleasures which I had formed to myself had I obtained this Permission are vanished from me and my Measures are quite broken But after my Heart was relieved by my Eye I was lighter and easier And the Result is we have heard of a good sort of Body that is to be my poor  Baby's Mother  when it comes and so your kindlyoffer'd Inquiries are needless I believe  I can't tell but this sort of Rebuff might be a little necessary after all for I had forgotten thro' Mr  B  's past Indulgence for so long a Time his Injunctions and Lessons  See  Vol II  p  c  before cited    and this awfullyinforced Remembrance shews me that the Rules he formerly prescribed were not Words of Course but that he intended to keep me up to the Letter of them So I must be a little more circumspect I find that then of late I thought I had Occasion to be  But he is the best and tenderest of Husbands for all this and yet I was forced to accept of  his  Forgiveness and he did not think himself obliged to me for  mine  and has carry'd his Point all to nothing as the Racing Gentlemen say But I can see one Thing nevertheless on this Occasion that the Words  Command  and  Obey  are not quite blotted out of his Vocabulary as he said they should be  See  Vol II  p      But truly I did not imagine before that the Husband had so very extensive a Prerogative neither Nor do I believe that many Ladies would sit down so satisfy'd with it as I am forced to do Yet he vows that it must have been so had he marry'd a  Princess  and that it is not because of the former Inequality of Condition between us  I can't tell what to say to that But I fansy there would then have been some  princely  Struggles between them had it been soIt may be if he could not have conquer'd he would not have liv'd with her or perhaps would have run into his wicked Polygamy Notions  Mr  B  to my further great  Comfort  has just been telling me how little a Wife of his must expect from her Tears and his most nicely been distinguishing between Tears of  Sullenness  and Tears of  Penitence  The one he declares shall always meet with his Indulgence and Kindness and never pass unrewarded But the other being the last Resources of the Sex after they are disarmed of all others and by which they too often as he says carry all their Purposes he will never suffer to have any Force at all upon him  Very heroick trulyOne stands a poor Chance in a Contest with such an HusbandIt must be all pure unmixed Obedience and Submission And  I find half the Tears a poor Wife might shed in matrimonial Bickerings so frequent with some even of those not unhappily married as the World goes would be of no Effect were all Men of his Mind  'Tis well for our Sex in general that there are not many Gentlemen who distinguish thus nicely For I doubt there are but very few so well intitled to their Ladies Observances as Mr  B  is and who would act so generously and so tenderly by a Wife as he does in every material Instance on which the Happiness of Life depends  But we are quite reconciled atho' as I said upon his own Terms And so I can still style myself  My dear honoured Parents  Your  happy  as well as dutiful Daughter  P B  LETTER IX From Lady  Davers  to Mrs  B  My dear  Pamela  I HAVE sent you a Present the completest I could procure of every thing that may suit your approaching happy Circumstance as I hope it will be to you and to us all But it is with a Hope annex'd That altho' both Sexes are thought of in it yet that you will not put us off with a Girl No Child we will not permit may we have our Wills that you shall  think  of giving us a Girl till you have presented us with half a dozen fine Boys For our Line is gone so low that we expect that human Security from you in your first Seven Years or we shall be disappointed I can tell you that  And now  Pamela  I will give you their Names if my Brother and you approve of them Your First shall be BILLY my Lord  Davers  and the Earl of C shall be Godfathers and it must be doubly Godmother'd too or I am afraid the Countess and I shall fall out about it Your Second shall be DAVERS besure remember thatYour Third shall be CHARLEY your Fourth JEMMY your Fifth HARRY your SixthDUDLEY if you willand your Girl if you had not rather call it PAMELA shall be BARBARAThe rest you must name as you pleaseAnd so my Dear I wish all Seven happily over with you  I am glad you got safe to Town and long to hear of Miss  Darnford  's Arrival because I know you'll be out of your Biass in your new Settlement till then She is a fine Lady and writes the most to my Taste of any one of her Sex that I know next to you I wish she'd be so kind to correspond with me But besure don't omit to give me the Sequel of her Sister and  Murray  's Affair and what you think will please me in relation to her You do well to save yourself the Trouble of describing the Town and the publick Places We are no Strangers to them and they are too much our Tabletalk when any Country Lady has for the first time been carried to Town and return'd Besides what  London  affords is nothing that deserves Mention compar'd to what we have seen at  Paris  and at  Versailles  and other of the  French  Palaces You exactly therefore hit our Tastes and answer our Expectations when you give us in your peculiar manner Sentiments on what we may call the  Soul of Things  and such Characters as you draw with a Pencil borrow'd from the Hand of Nature intermingled with those fine Lights and Shades of Reflections  and Observations that make your Pictures glow and instruct as well as inform  There  Pamela  is Incouragement for you to proceed in obliging us We are all of one Mind in this respect and more than ever since we have seen your Actions so well answer to your Writings and that Theory and Practice with regard to every Excellence that can adorn a Lady is the same thing with you  We are pleas'd with your Lawyers Characters There are Life and Nature in them but never avoid giving all the Characters that occur to you for that seems to be one of your Talents and in the ugliest you can draw there will be Matter of Instruction especially as you seem naturally to fall upon such as are so general that no one who converses but must see in them the Picture of one or other he is acquainted with  By this Time perhaps Miss  Darnford  will be with youOur Respects to her if soAnd you will have been at some of the Theatrical Entertainments So will not want Subjects to oblige us 'Twas a good Thought of your dear Man's to carry you to see the several Houses and to make you a Judge by that Means of the Disposition and Fashion of every thing in them Tell him I love him better and better I am proud of my Brother and do nothing but talk of what a charming Husband he makes But then he gives an Example to all who know him and his uncontrouled Temper which makes against many of us that it is possible for a good Wife to make even a bad Man a worthy Husband And this affords an Instruction which may stand all our Sex in good steadBut then they must have been cautious first that they have chosen a Man of natural good Sense and good Manners and not a brutal or abandon'd Debauchee  But harkyeme my sweet Girl what have I done to you that you won't write yourself  Sister  to me I could find in my Heart to be angry with you on this Account Before my last Visit indeed I was scrupulous to subscribe myself so to  you  But since I have seen myself so much surpass'd in all manner of Excellence that I would take Pleasure in the Name you assume a Pride in your Turn and think it an undervaluing of yourself I suppose to call  me  soAy that's the Thing I doubtAltho' I can tell you I have endeavour'd by several Regulations since my Return and the Countess too keeps your Example in distant View as well as I to be more worthy of the Appellation If therefore you would avoid the Reproaches of secret Pride under the Shadow of so remarkable an Humility for the future never omit subscribing as I do with great Pleasure  Your truly affectionate Sister and Friend  B DAVERS  I always take it for granted that my worthy Brother sends his Respects to us as you must that Lord  Davers  the good Countess and  Jackey  who as well as his Uncle talks of nothing else but you send theirs and so unnecessary Compliment will be always excluded our Correspondence  LETTER X In Answer to the preceding  HOW you overwhelm me with your Goodness my dearest Lady in every Word of your last welcome Letter is beyond my Power to express How nobly has your Lady contrived in your evervalu'd  Present to encourage a doubting and apprehensive Mind And how does it contribute to my Joy and my Glory that I am deemed by the noble Sister of my best Beloved not wholly unworthy of being the humble Means to continue and perhaps to perpetuate a Family so antient and so honourable  This Madam when I contemplate and look upon what I wasWhat can I sayHow shall I express the Sense of the Honour done meAnd when skipping over for a few Moments the other engaging Particulars in your Ladyship's Letter I come to the last charming Paragraph I am doubly affected to see myself seemingly upbraided but so politely imbolden'd to assume an Appellation that otherwise I hardly dar'd to assume  I  humble I  who never had a Sister before To find one now in  Lady  DAVERS O Madam you and  only  you can teach me Words fit to express the Joy and the Gratitude that fill my delighted HeartBut thus much I am taught and thus much I can say tho' at a Loss for other Words that there is something more than the Lowborn can imagine in Birth and Education This is so evident in your Lady's Actions Words and Manner that it strikes one with a becoming Reverence and we look up with Awe to a Condition we emulate in vain when raised by partial Favour like what I have found and are confounded when we see Grandeur of Soul join'd with Grandeur of Birth and Condition and a noble Lady acting thus nobly as Lady  Davers  acts  My best Wishes and a thousand Blessings attend your Ladyship in all you undertake And I am persuaded the latter will and a Peace and Satisfaction of Mind incomparably to be preferr'd to whatever else this World can afford in the new Regulations  which you and my dear Lady Countess have set on Foot in your Families And when I can have the Happiness to know what they are I shall I am confident greatly improve my own Methods by them Were we to live for ever in this Life we might be careless and indifferent about these Matters but when such an Uncertainty as to the Time and such a Certainty as to the Event is before us a prudent Mind will be always preparing till prepared and what can be a better Preparative than charitable Actions to our Fellowcreatures in the Eye of that Majesty which wants nothing of us himself but to do just and merciful Things to one another Pardon me my dearest Lady for this my free Style Methinks I am out of myself I know not how to descend all at once from the Height to which you have raised me And you must forgive the Reflections to which you yourself and your own noble Actions have given Birth  Here having taken Respite a little I find I naturally enough sink into  Body  againAnd will not your Ladyship confine your Expectations from me within narrower LimitsI hope you willFor Oh my excellent Lady I cannot even with my Wishes so swiftly follow your Expectations if such they are But however leaving Futurity to HIM who only can govern Futurity and who conducts us all and our Affairs as shall best answer his own Divine Purposes I will proceed as well as I can to obey your Ladyship in those Articles which are at present more within my own Power  My dear Miss  Darnford  then let me acquaint your Ladyship arrived here on  Thursday  last She had given us Notice by a Line of the Day she set out and Sir  Simon  and Lady  Darnford  saw her Ten Miles on the Way to the Stagecoach in Sir  Simon  's Coach Mr  Murray  attending her on Horseback they parted with her as was easy to guess from her Merit with great Tenderness and we are to look upon the Visit as we do as a high Favour from her Papa and Mamma who however charge her not to exceed a Month in and out which I regret much Mr  B  kindly proposed to me as Miss came in the Stagecoach attended with one Maidservant to meet her Part of the Way in his Coach and Six if as he was pleased to say it would not be too fatiguing to me and we would go so early as to dine at  St Albans  I gladly consented and we got thither about One o'Clock attended by Mr  Colbrand Abraham  and  John  and while Dinner was preparing he was pleased to shew me the great Church there and the curious Vault of the Good Duke of  Gloucester  and also the Monument of the Great Lord Chancellor  Bacon  in St  Michael  's Church all which no doubt your Ladyship has seen  There happen'd to be Six Passengers in the Stagecoach and Miss was exceedingly glad to be relieved from them tho' the Weather was cold enough Two of the Passengers being not very agreeable Company one a rough military Man the other a positive humoursome old Gentlewoman and the other Two not such as she had Reason to regret parting with Two Sisters who jangled nowandthen said Miss as much as  my  Sister and my Sister's  Sister    Your Ladyship will judge how joyful this Meeting was to Miss and to me Mr  B  was no less delighted and said He was infinitely obliged to Sir  Simon  for this precious Trust  Miss said I came with double Pleasure to see the greatest Curiosity in  England  an Husband and a Wife who have not in so many Months that you  have been marry'd if I may believe Report and your Letters Mrs  B  once repented You are severe Miss said Mr  B  upon People in the marry'd State I hope there are many such Instances  There might said she if there were more such Husbands as Mr  B  makesOh you are a charming ManI hated you once and I thought you very wicked but I revere you now  If you will  revere  any body my dear Miss said he let it be this good Girl for it is all owing to her Conduct and Discretion that I make a tolerable Husband Were there more such Wives I am persuaded there would be more such Husbands than there are  You see my dear Miss said I what it is to be wedded to a generous Mind Mr  B  by his noble Treatment of me creates a Merit in me and disclaims the natural Effects of his own Goodness  Well you're a charming CouplePerson and Mind I know not any Equal either of you have But Mr  B  I will not compliment you too highly I may make  you  proud for Men are saucy Creatures but I cannot make your  Lady  so And in this Doubt of the one and Confidence in the other I must join with you that  her  Merit is the greatestSince excuse me bold Gentleman as I know you have been her Example has reformed her Rake and you have only confirm'd in her the Virtues you found ready formed to your Hand  That Distinction said Mr  B  is worthy of Miss  Darnford  's Judgment  My dearest Miss my dearest Mr  B  said I takeing each by the Hand how can you go on thus As I look upon every kind thing Two such dear Friends say to me as Incentives for me to endeavour to deserve them you must not task me too  high for then instead of encouraging you'll give me Despair  The dear Gentleman clasped us both in his Arms and saluted eachAnd called us his Two Nonpareils  He led us into the Coach placing Miss and me on the Frontseat and himself on the other with Miss's Maidservant a genteel prudent young Body whom her Lady would fain have left in the Stage to avoid the Honour of sitting with Mr  B  And in a free easy joyful Manner not in the least tir'd or fatigu'd did we reach the Town and Mr  B  's House with which and its Furniture and the Apartments allotted for her Miss is highly pleased  But the dear Lady put me into some little Confusion when she saw me first taking Notice of my Improvements as she called them before Mr  B  I look'd at him and look'd at herDear Miss said I with a blushing Cheek and downcast Eye He smiled at Miss and said Would  you  my good Miss look so silly after such a Length of Time with an Husband you had no Occasion to be asham'd ofNo indeed Sir not I I'll assure you nor will I forgive those Maiden Airs in a Wife so happy as you are I said nothing But I wish'd myself in Mind and Behaviour to be just what Miss  Darnford  is  But my dear Lady Miss  Darnford  has had those early Advantages from Conversation which I had not and so I must never expect to know how to deport myself with that modest Freedom and Ease which altho' some of my Favourers attribute to me yet I know I want and shall always want For I am every Day more and more sensible of the great Difference there is in being us'd to the politest Conversation as an Inferior and in being born to  bear a Part in it In the one all is set stiff aukward and the Person just such an Ape of Imitation as poor I In the other all is natural Ease and Sweetnesslike Miss  Darnford    Knowing this I don't indeed aim at what I am sensible I cannot attain and so I hope am less exposed to Ridicule than I should be if I did For I have heard Mr  B  observe with regard to Gentlemen who build fine Houses and make fine Gardens and open fine Prospects that Art should never take place of but be subservient to Nature and a Gentleman if he is confin'd to a Situation had better conform his Designs to that than to do as at  Chatsworth  was done that is to say level a Mountain at a monstrous Expence which had it been suffered to remain in so wild and romantick a Scene as  Chatsworth  affords might have been made one of the greatest Beauties of the Place  So I Madam think I had better endeavour to make the best of those natural Defects I cannot master than by assuming Airs and Dignities in Appearance to which I was not born act neither Part tolerably By this means instead of being thought neither Gentlewoman nor Rustick as Sir  Jacob  hinted  Linseywolsey  I think was his Term too I may be look'd upon as an Original in my Way and all Originals pass Muster well enough you know Madam even with Judges  Now I am upon this Subject I can form to myself if your Ladyship will excuse me two such polite Gentlemen as my Lawyers mention'd in my former who with a true  London  Magnanimity and PenetrationFor Madam I fansy your  London  Criticks will be the severest upon the Country Girl will put on mighty significant Looks forgetting maybe they have any Faults themselves and apprehending they have  nothing to do but to sit in Judgment upon others expressing themselves after this manner  "Why truly  Jack  the Girl is well enough  considering  I can't say"  then a Pinch of Snuff perhaps adds Importance to their Air  "but a Man might love her for a Month or two"  These Sparks talk'd in this manner of other Ladies before me  "She behaves better than I expected from her  considering  "  again will follow  "So I think cries the other and tosses his Tye behind him with an Air partly of Contempt and partly of Rakery As you say  Jemmy  I expected to find an aukward Country Girl but she tops her Part I'll assure yeNay for that matter behaves very tolerably for  what she was  And is right not to seem desirous to drown the Remembrance of her Original in her ElevationAnd I can't but say"  for something like it they did say  "is mighty pretty and passably genteel"  And thus with their poor Praise of Mr  B  's Girl they think they have made a fine Compliment to his Judgment  But for  his  sakefor as to my own I am not solicitous about  such  Gentlemens good Opinions I owe them a Spite and believe I shall find an Opportunity to come out of their Debt For I have the Vanity to think now your Ladyship has made me proud by your kind Incouragements and Approbation that the Country Girl will make 'em look about 'em with all their  genteel Contempts  which they miscal  Praise    But how I run on Your Ladyship expects me to write as freely as I used to do to my Parents I have the Merit of obeying you that I have but I doubt too much to the Exercise of your Patience This like all mine is a long Letter and I will only add to it Miss  Darnford  's humble Respects  and Thanks for your Ladyship's kind Mention of her which she receives as no small Honour  And now Madam with a greater Pleasure than I can express will I make use of the Liberty your Ladyship so kindly allows me to take of subscribing myself with that profound Respect which becomes me  Your Ladyship's most obliged Sister and Servant  P B  Mr  Adams  Mr  Longman  and Mrs  Jervis  are just arrived and our Houshold is now complete  LETTER XI From Lady  DAVERS  to Mrs  B  My dear  Pamela  AFTER I have thanked you for your last agreeable Letter which has added the Earl and Lord  John  and Lady  Jenny  to the Number of your Admirers you know Lady  Betty  their Sister was so before I shall tell you that I now write at all their Requests as well as at those of my Lord  Davers  the Countess you so dearly love and Lady  Betty  for your Decision of an odd Dispute that on reading your Letter and talking of your domestick Excellencies happen'd among us  Lady  Betty  would have it That notwithstanding any Aukwardness which you attribute to yourself she cannot but decide by all she has seen of you and has heard us say that yours is the perfectest Character she ever heard or read of  The Countess said That you wrong yourself in supposing that you are not every thing that is polite  and genteel in your Behaviour as well as Person and that she knows not any Lady in  England  who better becomes her Station than you do  Why then said Lady  Jenny  Mrs  B  must be quite perfect that's certain So said her Brother Lord  John  So said the Earl their Father So said they all And Lord  Davers  confirm'd that you were And  Jackey swore  to it  Yet as we are sure there cannot be such a Character in this Life as has not one Fault altho' we could not tell where to fix it the Countess started a whimsical MotionLady  Davers  said she pray do you write to Mrs  B  and acquaint her with our Subject and as it is impossible that one who can act as she does should not know herself better than any body else can do desire her to acquaint us with some of those secret Foibles that leave room for her to be still more perfect  A good Thought said I A good Thought said they allAnd this is the present Occasion of my writing and pray see that you accuse yourself of no more than you know yourself guilty For Overmodesty borders so nearly on Pride and too liberal Accusations seem to be but so many Traps for Acquittal with Applause that you whatever other Ladies might will not be forgiven if you deal with us in a way so poorly artful Let them therefore be such Faults as you think we can subscribe to from what we have  seen  of  you  and  read  of  yours  and you must try to extenuate them too as you give them lest we should think you above that Nature which in the most and  best  Cases is your undoubted Talent  I congratulate you and Miss  Darnford  on her Arrival She is a charming young Lady but tell her that we shall not allow her to take you at your Word and to think that she excels you in any one thing  Only indeed we think you nicer in some Points than you need to be as to your present agreeable Circumstance And yet let me tell you that the easy and unaffected conjugal Purity in Word and Behaviour between your good Man and you is worthy of Imitation and what the Countess and I have with Pleasure contemplated since we left you an hundred times and admire in you both And 'tis good Policy too Child as well as high Decorum for it is what will make you ever new and respectful to one another  But  You  have the Honour of it all whose sweet natural and easy Modesty in Person Behaviour and Conversation forbid Indecency even in Thought much more in Word to approach you insomuch that no Rakes can be Rakes in your Presence and yet they hardly know to what they owe their Restraint  However as People who see you will take it for granted that you and Mr  B  have been very intimate together I should think you need not be asham'd of your Appearance because as he rightly observes you have no Reason to be asham'd of your Husband  Excuse my Pleasantry my Dear And answer our Demand upon you as soon as you can which will oblige us all particularly  Your affectionate Sister  B DAVERS  LETTER XII  My dearest Lady  WHAT a Task have you imposed upon me And according to the Terms you annex to it how shall I acquit myself of it without incurring  the Censure of Affectation if I freely accuse myself as I may deserve or of Vanity if I do not Indeed Madam I have a great many Failings and you don't know the Labour it costs me to keep them under not so much for fear the World should see them for I bless God I can hope they are not capital as for fear they should become capital if I were to let them grow upon me  And this surely I need not have told your Ladyship and my Lady Countess who have read my Papers and seen my Behaviour in the kind Visit you made to your dear Brother and had from  both  but too much Reason to censure me did not your generous and partial Favour make you overlook my greater Failings and pass under a kinder Name many of my lesser For surely my good Ladies you must both of you have observed in what you have read and seen that I am naturally of a spiteful saucy Temper and with all my appearing Meekness and Humility can resent and sting too when I think myself provoked  I have also discover'd in myself on many Occasions of some of which I will byandby remind your Ladyship a Malignancy of Heart that it is true lasts but a little whilenot had it needbut for which I have often called myself to Account to very little Purpose hitherto  And indeed Madam now for a little Extrenuation as you expect from me I have some Difficulty whether I ought in the Station to which I am raised to take much Pains to subdue myself in some Instances that otherwise it would have become me to attempt to do For it is no easy Task for a Person in my Circumstances to distinguish between the  ought  and the  ought not  to be humble without Meannes and decent without Arrogance And let me add That if every body thought as justly  as I flatter myself I do of the Inconveniencies as well as Conveniences which attend the being rais'd to a Condition above them they would not imagine all the World was their own when they come to be distinguish'd as I have been For what with the Contempts of superior Relations on one side which all such must undergo at first the Envy of the World and low Reflections arising from that Envy on the other from which no one must hope to be totally exempted and the Aukwardness besides with which they support their elevated Condition if they have Sense to judge of their own Imperfections and if the Gentleman be not such an one as mine and where will such another be foundOn all these Accounts I say they will be made sensible That whatever they might once think Happiness and an high Estate are Two very different things  But I shall be too grave when your Ladyship and all my kind and noble Friends expect perhaps I should give the uncommon Subject a pleasanter Air Yet what must that Mind be that is not serious when it is oblig'd to recollect and give Account of its Defects  But I must not  only  accuse myself it seems I must give  Proofs  such as your Ladyship can subscribe to of my Imperfections There is so much  real Kindness  imply'd in this  seeming Hardship  that I will obey you Madam and produce Proofs in a Moment which cannot be controverted  Let me then in the first Place as to the Selfaccusation of  Spitefulness  refer your Ladyship and those of my noble Friends who have read my Papers to the Character I gave in them of poor Mrs  Jewkes  See  Vol I  p    also to honest Mr  Colbrand  's Character as I gave it when I suspected he was to be imploy'd for the worst Purposes  Ibid  p    both of which tho' not  untrue in the main are so drawn as to shew a very spiteful Nature in the Characterizer  And as to my  Sauciness  those Papers will give an hundred Instances against meas well to your dear Brother as to othersIndeed to extenuate as you command me as I go along these were mostly when I was apprehensive for my Honour that they were  And then my dear Lady I have a little Tincture of  Jealousy  which sometimes has made me more uneasy than I ought to be as the Papers you have not seen would have demonstrated particularly in Miss  Godfrey  's Case  See  Vol II  p    c  and in my Conversation with your Ladyships in which I have frequently betray'd my Apprehensions of what might happen when we came to  London  Yet to extenuate again I have examin'd myself very strictly on this Head and I really think that I can ascribe a great Part of this Jealousy to laudable Motives no less than the Concern I have for your dear Brother's future Happiness in the Hope that I may be an humble Means in the Hands of Providence to induce him to abhor those Crimes in which young Gentlemen too often indulge themselves and to bring him over to the Practice of those Virtues in which he will for ever have Cause to rejoiceYet my Lady some other Parts of the Charge must stand against me for as to be sure I love his Person as well as his Mind I have Pride in my Jealousy that would nor permit me I verily think to support myself as I ought under the Trial of a Competition in this tender very tender Point  And this obliges me to own that I have a little not a little perhapsSpark of  secret Pride  and  Vanity  that will arise nowandthen on the Honours done me but which I keep under as much  as I can And to this Pride let me tell your Ladyship I know no one contributes or can contribute more largely than yourself  So you see my dear Lady what a naughty Heart I have and how far I am from being a faultless CreatureI hope I shall be better and better however as I live longer and have more Grace and more Wit For here to recapitulate my Faults is in the first Place  Vindictiveness  I will not call it downright Revenge that I will notFor as the Poet says  Revenge is but a Frailty incident  To craz'd and sickly Minds the poor Content  Of little Souls unable to surmount  An Injury too weak to bear Affront  And I would not be thought to have a  little Mind  because I know I would not do a  little Thing Vindictiveness  then let it stand tho' that's a harsh Word to accuse one's self of  SpitefulnessJealousy Secret PrideVanity  which I cannot for my Life keep totally underO dear Madam are not here Faults enow without naming any moreAnd how much room do all these leave for Amendment and greater Perfection  Had your Ladyship and my Lady Countess favour'd us longer in your late kind Visit it had been impossible but I must have improv'd every Day by your delightful Conversations so as to have got over such of these Foibles as are not rooted in Nature For to behold that natural Ease and Dignity which accompany every thing your Ladyships do and say must have made me more than emulate those Perfections which at present I can only at an awful Distance revere as becomes  My dear Ladies  Your most humble Admirer and obliged Servant  P B  LETTER XIII From Miss  Darnford  to her Father and Mother  My everhonoured Papa and Mamma  I Arriv'd safely in  London  on  Thursday  after a tolerable Journey considering  Deb  and I made Six in the Coach Two having been taken up on the Way after you left me and none of the Six highly agreeable Mr  B  and his Lady who looks very stately upon us from the Circumstance of  Person  rather than of  Mind  however were so good as to meet me at  St Albans  in their Coach and Six They have a fine House here richly furnish'd in every Part and allotted me the best Apartments in it  We are happy beyond Expression Mr  B  is a charming Husband so easy so pleas'd with and so tender of his Lady and she so much All that we saw her in the Country as to Humility and Affability and improv'd in every thing else which we hardly thought possible she could bethat I never knew so happy a MatrimonyAll that  Prerogative Sauciness  which we apprehended would so eminently display itself in his Behaviour to his Lady had she been ever so distinguish'd by Birth and Fortune is vanish'd and no Traces of it left I did not think it was in the Power of an Angel if our Sex could have produc'd one to have made so tender and so fond an Husband of Mr  B  as he makes And should I have the Sense to follow Mrs  B  's Example if ever I marry I should not despair of making myself happy let it be to whom it would provided he was not a Brute nor sordid in his Temper which two Characters are too obvious to be conceal'd if Persons take due Care and make proper  Inquiries and if they are not led by blind Passion May Mr  Murray  and Miss  Nancy  make just such an happy Pair  You commanded me my honour'd Mamma to write to you an Account of every thing that pleas'd meI said I would But what a Task should I then haveI did not think I had undertaken to write VolumesYou must therefore allow me to be more brief than I had intended  In the first place It would take up five or six long Letters to do Justice to the Oeconomy observed in this happy Family You know and we have often admir'd and applauded her for it that Mrs  B  has not chang'd one of the Servants of the Family and only added her  Polly  to the Number This is an unexampled thing especially as they were all her  Fellowservants  as we may say But since they have the Sense to admire so good an Example and are proud to follow it each to his and her Power I think it one of her peculiar Felicities to have continued them and to chuse to reform such as were exceptionable rather than dismiss them  Their Mouths  Deb  tells me are continually full of their Lady's Praises and Prayers and Blessings utter'd with such Delight and Fervour for the happy Pair that it makes her Eyes she says ready to run over to hear them  Moreover I think it an extraordinary Piece of Policy whether design'd or not▪ to keep them as they were honest and worthy Folks for had she turn'd them all off what had she done but made as many Enemies as Persons and as many more as those Persons had Friends and Acquaintance And we all know how much the Reputation of Families lies at the Mercy of Servants and 'tis easy to guess to what Cause each would have imputed their Dismission And so she has escaped as she ought to  escape the Character of Pride and has made every one instead of reproaching her with her Descent find those Graces in her which turn that very Disadvantage to her Glory  She is exceeding affable to every one of them always speaks to them with a Smile but yet has such a Dignity in her Manner that it secures her their Respect and Reverence and they are ready to fly at a Look and seem proud to have any Commands of hers to execute Insomuch that the Words  My Lady commands so or so  from one Servant to another are sure to meet with an indisputable Obedience be the Duty requir'd what it will  If any one of them is the least out of Order her Care and Tenderness for them ingage the Duty and the Veneration and Gratitude of all the rest who see in that Instance how kindly they will be treated should they ail any thing themselves And in all this I must needs say she is very happy in Mrs  Jervis  who is an excellent Second to her admirable Lady and is treated by her with as much Respect and Affection as if she was her Mother  You may remember Madam that in the Account she gave us of her  benevolent Round  as Lady  Davers  calls it she says That as she was going to  London  she should leave Directions with Mrs  Jervis  about some of her  Clients  as I find she calls her Poor to avoid a Word that her Delicacy accounts harsh with regard to them and ostentatious with respect to herself I ask'd her how since contrary to her then Design Mrs  Jervis  was permitted to be in Town with her she had provided to answer her Intention as to those her Clients whom she had referr'd to the Care of that good Woman  She said That Mr  Barlow  her Apothecary was a very worthy Man and she had given him a plenary Power in that Particular and likewise desir'd him to  recommend any new and worthy Case to her that no distressful Circumstance among the deserving and destitute sick Poor might be unreliev'd by reason of her Absence  And here in  London  she has applied herself to Dr her Parishminister a fine Preacher and sound Divine who promises at all Opportunities to pay his Respects to Mr  B  to recommend to her any poor Housekeepers who will be glad to accept of some private Benefactions and yet having liv'd creditably till reduced by Misfortunes are asham'd to apply for publick Relief And she has several of these already on her  benevolent List  to some of whom she sends Coals now on the Entrance of the wintry Season to some a Piece of  Irish  or  Scotish  Linen or so many Yards of  Norwich  Stuff for Gowns and Coats for Girls or  Yorkshire  Cloth for the Boys and to some of whose Prudence she is most assur'd in laying it out in the way they best can judge of Money And she has moreover  mortify'd  as the  Scots  call it  l  as a Fund for Loans without Interest of or but not exceeding  l  to answer some present Exigence in some worthy Families who find the best Security they can to repay it in a given Time and this Fund she purposes as she grows richer she says to increase and prides herself every nowandthen upon her Frugality to have sav'd so much Money already and estimates pleasantly her Worth by this Sum saying sometimes Who would ever have thought I should have been worth  l  already I shall be a rich Body in time But in all these things she injoins Secrecy which the Doctor has promis'd  She told the Doctor what Mr  Adams  's Office was in her Family and hop'd she said he would give her his Sanction to it assuring him That she thought it her Duty to ask it as she was one of his  Flock and he on that account her principal Shepherd which made a spiritual Relation between them the Requisites of which on her Part were not to be dispensed with You may be sure the good Gentleman very chearfully and applaudingly gave her his Consent and when she told him how well Mr  Adams  was provided for and that she should apply to him to supply her with a TownChaplain when she was depriv'd of him he wish'd that the other Duties of his Function for he has a large Parish would permit him to be the happy Person himself saying That till she was supply'd to her Mind either he or his Curate would take care that so laudable a Method should be kept up  You will do me the Justice Madam to believe that I very chearfully join in my dear Friend's  Sunday  Duties and am not a little edify'd with the good Example and with the Seriousness Harmony and Goodwill that this lovely Method contributes to keep up in the Family  I must own I never saw such a Family of Love in my Life For here under the Eye of the best and most respected of Mistresses they twice every  Sunday  see one another all together as in the Country in a Body superior as well as inferior Servants and  Deb  tells me after Mrs  B  and I are withdrawn there are such friendly Salutations among them that she never heard the likeYour Servant good Maister  Longman  Your Servant Maister  Colbrand  cries one and another How do you  John  I'm glad to see you  Abraham  All blessedly met once more cries  Jonathan  the venerable Butler with his silver Hairs as Mrs  B  always distinguishes him Good Madam  Jervis  cries another you look purely this blessed Day thank GODAnd they return to their several Vocations so light so easy so pleas'd so eventemper'd in their Minds as their  chearful Countenances as well as Expressions testify that it is an Heaven of an House And being wound up thus constantly once a Week like a good Eightday Clock no Piece of Machinery that ever was made is so regular and uniform as this Family is  What an Example does this dear Lady set to all who see her to all who know her and to all who hear of her and have the Grace to imitate her What a publick Blessing would such a Mind as hers be could it be vested with the Robes of Royalty and adorn the Sovereign DignityBut what are the Princes of the Earth look at them in every Nation and what have they been for Ages past compar'd to this Lady who acts from the Impulses of her own Heart unaided by any human Example And how can one avoid thinking of Inspiration in this Case or that she was dropp'd down when the creating MIND was forming Angels forgive the Enthusiasm which the Contemplation of her innumerable Excellencies raises to be received into bodily Organs and to live among Men and Women in order to shew what the first of the Species was designed to be  This reminds me of what my honoured Papa said once at our own House to Mr  B  See  Vol II  p    That there was but one such Angel descended from Heaven in a thousand Years and he had got her  And yet here is the Admiration That one sees all these Duties performed in such an easy and pleasant manner as any body may perform them for they interfere not with any Parts of the Family Management take up no Time from the most necessary Imployments but rather aid and inspirit every one in the Discharge of all their domestick Services and moreover keep their Minds in a State of Preparation  for the more solemn Duties of the Day and all without the least Intermixture of Affectation Enthusiasm or Ostentation O my dear Papa and Mamma permit me but to tarry here till I am perfect in all these good Lessons and how happy shall I be  I am mindful my dear Mamma of yours and our good Neighbours Requests to Mrs  B  to oblige you with the Conversations she mentioned the one with the young Ladies related to Mrs  Towers  and Mrs  Arthur  the other with Mr  B  on her Father and Mother a Subject which always however humble raises her admired Pen and of Consequence our Expectations and I will prevail upon her to let me transcribe them for your Entertainment She writes down every thing that passes which she thinks may one Day be of Use to Miss  Goodwin  and to her own Children if she shall live to have any and to see them grown up What a charming Mamma as well as Wife and Mistress will this dear Lady make  As to the Town and the Diversions of it I shall not trouble you with any Accounts of them because you know the one and from the Time we passed here last Winter as well as your former thorough Knowledge of both you will want no Information about the other for generally speaking all who reside constantly in  London  allow that there is little other Difference in the Diversions of one Winter and another than such as are in Cloaths a few Variations of the Fashions only which are mostly owing to the ingenious Contrivances of Persons who are to get their Bread by diversifying them  Mrs  B  has undertaken to give Lady  Davers  an Account of Matters as they pass and her Sentiments on what she sees There must be something new in her Observations because she is a Stranger to these Diversions and unbiassed intirely by Favour or Prejudice  and so will not play the partial Critick but give to a Beauty its due Praise and to a Fault its due Censure according to that Truth and Nature which are the unerring Guides of her Actions as well as Sentiments These I will procure for you as she gives me Leave to transcribe what she writes and you'll be so good as to return them when perus'd because I will lend them as I used to do her Letters to her good Parents and so I shall give her a Pleasure at the same time in the accommodating them with the Knowlege of all that passes which she makes it a Point of Duty to do because they take Delight in her Writings  My Papa's Observation that a Woman never takes a Journey that she don't forget something is justify'd by me for with all my Care I have forgot my Diamond Buckle which Miss  Nancy  will find in the inner Till of my Bureau wrapt up in Cotton and I beg it may be sent me by the first Opportunity With my humble Duty to you both my dear indulgent Papa and Mamma Thanks for the Favour I now rejoice in and affectionate Respects to Miss  Nancy  I wish she would love me as well as I love her and Service to Mr  Murray  and all our good Neighbours conclude me  Your dutiful and highly favour'd Daughter  M DARNFORD  Mr  B  and Mrs  B  desire their Compliments of Congratulation to Mr and Mrs  Peters  on the happy Marriage of their worthy Niece which they knew nothing of till I told them of it Also to your honoured Selves they desire their kind Respects and Thanks for the Loan of your worthless Daughter  I experience every Hour some new Token of their Politeness and Affection and I make no Scruple to think I am with just such a Brother and such a Sister as any happy Creature may rejoice in and be proud ofMr  B  I cannot but repeat is a charming Husband and a most polite Gentleman His Lady is always accusing herself to me of Aukwardness and Insufficiency but not a Soul who sees her can find it out She is all genteel Ease and the Admiration of every one who beholds her Only I tell her with such Happiness in Possession she is a little of the gravest sometimes  The Letter which contains the Account of the Conversation requested by Miss  Darnford  p of this Volume and promised by Mrs  B  p and mentioned by Miss in the preceding Letter will be found the last Letter but one of this Volume For Miss  Darnford  having mislaid the first Copy of it requested another two or three Years after this when married herself for the sake of two young Ladies in her Neighbourhood whose inconsiderate Rashness had given great Affliction to their honourable Parents And Mrs  B  with a View to their particular Case having made divers Additions and Improvements to it it will come in more properly as we conceive in the Course of these Letters at or near the Time when those Improvements were made to it  LETTER XIV From Mrs  B  to Lady  DAVERS    My good Lady  YOU command me to acquaint you with the Proceedings between Mr  Murray  and Miss  Nanny Darnford  And Miss  Polly  makes it very easy for me to obey you in this Particular and in very few Words for she says Every thing was adjusted before she came away and the Ceremony she believes may be performed by this Time She rejoices that she was out of the way of it For she says Love is so aukward a Thing to Mr  Murray  and Goodhumour so uncommon an one to Miss  Nancy  that she hopes she shall never see such another Courtship  Mr  B  teizes Miss that she is a little piqu'd and that she shew'd it by a satirical Fling or two in a former Letter to me that her humble Servant took her at her Word And yet he acknowleges that he believes she despises him as by his Conduct he has shewn that he deserves to be despised by her  She says nothing has piqu'd her in the whole Affair but the Triumph it gave to  that illnatur'd Girl  as she justly calls her Sister who has insulted her unmercifully on that Account and yet with so low and mean a Spite that she has been vex'd at herself to shew the least Concern on the Occasion But ungenerous Teizing is an intolerable thing as she says and often repeated will vex a Mind naturally above it Had it says she come from any body else I should not have heeded it but how can one despise a Sister  We have been at the Playhouse several times and give me Leave to say Madam for I have now read as well as seen several That I think the Stage by proper Regulations might be made a profitable Amusement But nothing more convinces one than these Representations of the Truth of the common Observation That the best Things corrupted may prove the worst The Terror and Compunction for evil Deeds the Compassion for a just Distress  and the general Beneficence which those lively Exhibitions are so capable of raising in the human Mind may be of great Service when directed to right Ends and induced by proper Motives where the Actions which the Catastrophe is designed to punish are not set in such advantageous Lights as shall destroy the End of the Moral and make the Vice that ought to be censured imitable where the Distress arises from proper Motives where Instruction is kept in View all the Way and Vice is punished and Virtue rewarded  But give me Leave to say that I think there is hardly one Play I have seen or read hitherto but has too much of Love in it as that Passion is generally treated How unnatural in some how inflameing in others are the Descriptions of itIn most rather Rant and Fury like the Loves of the fiercer Brute Animals as  Virgil  translated by  Dryden  describes them than the soft sighing fearfullyhopeful Murmurs that swell the Bosoms of our gentler Sex and the respectful timorous submissive Complainings of the other when the Truth of the Passion humanizes as one may say their more rugged Hearts  In particular my dear Lady what strange Indelicates do these Writers of Tragedy often make of our Sex They don't enter into the Passion at all if I have any Notion of it But when the Authors want to paint it strongly such as in those Plays I have seen and read their Aim seems to be to raise a Whirlwind as I may say which sweeps down Reason Religion and Decency and carries every laudable Duty away before it so that all the Example can serve to shew is how a disappointed Lover may rage and storm resent and revenge  The Play I first saw was the Tragedy of the  Distress'd Mother  and a great many beautiful Things  I think there are in it But half of it is a tempestuous cruel ungoverned Rant of Passion and ends in Cruelty Bloodshed and Desolation which the Truth of Story not warranting as Mr  B  tells me makes it the more Pity that the original Author for it is a  French  Play translated you know Madam had not conducted it since it was in his Choice with less Terror and with greater Propriety to the Passions intended and actually raised in many Places  I need not tell your Ladyship what the Story is and yet it is necessary as you demand my Opinion that I should give a little Sketch of it It is this then  "  Pyrrhus  the Son of  Achilles  is betrothed to  Hermione  the Daughter of  Menelaus  but  Hector  's Widow  Andromache  with  Astyanax  her Son by  Hector  in the Division of the  Trojan  Captives falls to the Lot of  Pyrrhus  who slighting  Hermione  actually sent to his Court and  in  his Court waiting his good Pleasure to espouse her falls in Love with  Andromache Orestes  the Son of  Agamemnon  in Love with  Hermione  is sent Embassador from the other  Greek  Princes to demand the Life of  Astyanax  for fear the poor Infant should become another  Hector  and avenge his Father's Death a most improbable unprincely and basehearted Fear as  Pyrrhus  himself represents it  Pyrrhus  in hopes to gain the Mother's Love which he seeks on honourable Terms offers to break with all his Allies rather than give up the Child but finding her resolv'd on Widowhood determines to sacrifice the Child and to marry  Hermione  This creates a fine Distress in  Andromache  between a laudable Purpose to continue the Widow of so great and so deserving a Prince and her Desire to preserve the Life of her Son by that beloved Hero and at last overcome  by maternal Tenderness finding no other Way she resolves to marry  Pyrrhus  and yet to destroy herself after the Marriage Ceremony had intitled her Son to her new Husband's Protection A very strange and not very certain Expedient to answer her View and so to die the Widow of  Hector  tho' she gave her Hand to  Pyrrhus  and vow'd herself his at the Altar and of Consequence had a still less Power over her own Life than before  Hermione  a highspirited Lady raging in her Love to  Pyrrhus  and for the Slight and Disappointment she met with obliges  Orestes  on Promise of giving her Heart and Hand to him to murder  Pyrrhus  at the Altar while the Ceremony of Marriage with  Andromache  was performing He causes this to be done When done he applies to  Hermione  expecting her Applause who then violently upbraids him for having obey'd her and flying towards the Temple meets the Body of  Pyrrhus  and stabs herself upon it  "Upon this  Orestes  runs mad and it is said to be the finest mad Scene in any  English  Play  Andromache  remains Queen her Son lives and being diverted from her own bloodyPurpose she has nothing to do but to give Orders for the Funeral of  Pyrrhus  and to bring her Son in Triumph from a Prison to a Palace"  This is in brief the Story Now Madam since you will hive me I will tell you in my artless Way what I think not quite so pretty and what is great and beautiful in this Play which upon the Whole however I was much pleased with and should have been more had there been less Terror in it and more Probability as I presume to say in some of its Parts and had not the softest Passion in  Nature been treated as such a flaming Thing as cannot be a worthy Example to Female Minds  And first I could not but observe that the Plea of the Princes of  Greece  for the Murder of  Astyanax  a helpless Infant to procure which and for nothing else they send one of the chief Princes or  Greece  Embassador to  Pyrrhus  is a very poor one and most easily answer'd For thus  Orestes  says among other very pompous Things  Have you so soon forgot the mighty  Hector  The  Greeks  remember his  highbrandish'd  Sword  That fill'd their States with Widows and with Orphans  For which they call for Vengeance on his Son  Who knows what he may one Day prove  And in another Place  Troy  may again revive and a new  Hector  Rise in  Astyanax    And in another Place  Sir call to mind th' unrivall'd Strength of  Troy  Her Walls her Bulwarks and her Gates of Brass  Her Kings her Heroes and imbattled Armies  What Tragedy Pomp is this How poor the Plea from Princes and Heroes when it is so easily answer'd by  Pyrrhus  in this manner  I call them all to mind and see them all  Confus'd in Dust all mix'd in onewide Ruin  All but a Child and he in Bondage held  What Vengeance can we fear in such a  Troy  And a little before  Let dastard Souls be timorously wise  But tell them  Pyrrhus  knows not how to form  Farfansy'd Ills and Dangers out of Sight  And still with greater Contempt  I thought your Kings were met  On more important Counsels When I heard  The Name of their Embassador I hop'd  Some glorious Enterprize was taking Birth  Is  Agamemnon  's Son dispatch'd for this  And do the  Grecian  Chiefs renown'd in War  A Race of Heroes join in close Debate  To plot an Infant's Death  But what if this very  Pyrrhus  after twenty humane and generous Things which the Poet makes him say shews that all this right Thinking is only owing to his Passion for the Mother And as soon as she gives him to understand she is resolved to remain  Hector  's Widow he determines to give way to the Embassy and Threats of the  Grecian  Princes which he had so justly despised and to destroy the Infant But first he tells her  'Tis true  Hermione  was sent to share  My Throne and Bed  A fine Errand for a highspirited Lady and to wait afterwards his good Pleasure in his own Court thro' a Series of Slights and Contempts for the Performance of his Vows And he generously like a true insulting Man boasts  And would with Transport hear  The Vowswhich you neglect  To which  Andromache  nobly answers  She has no  Troy  No  Hector  to lament She has not lost  A Husband by your Conquests Such a Husband  Tormenting Thought whose Death alone has made  Your Sire immortal  This inrages the Hero and what he should have admir'd her for had his Soul been half as noble as hers he thus resents  I've been too tame I will awake to Vengeance  The  Son  shall answer for his  Mother  's Scorn  The  Greeks  demand him Nor will I indanger  My Realms to pleasure an ungrateful Woman  Accordingly he resolves to sacrifice the Child to do Justice to  Hermione  out of Spite to  Andromache  And most ungenerously knowing  Orestes  loves  Hermione  to Distraction tells him he shall grace his Nuptial Rites and he will receive  Hermione  from his Hands  But now again see what succeeds to this One Look of Favour from  Andromache  reverses all his new Resolves makes him throw new Indignities on  Hermione  new Contempts upon the  Greek  Princes and shew that if he acts right in one Point the saving of the Child it is from wrong and unjustifiable Motives and yet the Poet seems to design him an amiable Character  Now Madam could not a Distress have been formed in this Story from more laudable and proper Motives Should this Passion of unbridled Love be represented in such a strong such an irresistible Light to an Audience who must be taught that the highest Ingratitude the most rageful Extreme of sensual Passion the most unjustifiable Actions and the Sacrifice of all Considerations of publick Good and private Right had Examples all in this Piece to warrant them  'Tis true  Pyrrhus  is punish'd by a cruel Assassination  Hermione  falls by her own Hand for murdering him by the Hands of the  Greeks  and the Phrensy of  Orestes  becomes his Punishment But what a Scene of Terror does all this raise How unlikely  to be an Exemplar either to publick or private Life And what a hard Fate is that of  Hermione  slighted despised insulted by the Man she lov'd to whom she was betro  hed and whose Resentment therefore was warranted had it shewn itself in almost any Act short of the Murder which in the Violence of her Passion she commanded  Orestes  to perpetrate  Then Madam the Love of  Hermione  for  Pyrrhus  is not I think of that delicate Sort which ought to be set before our Sex for an Example'Tis Rage not Love that of a Woman slighted and however just supposing our Sex to have such revengeful Hearts when slighted by the Man they love is not so exemplary as one would wish And besides she is represented as sometimes  sighing and wishing for  Orestes when a true Love bears not the Thought of any Object but that one it sighs for even should that be ungrateful Thus it is said of  Orestes  by her Confidante  Orestes  whose Return you oft had wish'd  The Man whose Suff'rings you so oft lamented  And often prais'd his Constancy and Love  Then  Hermione  repeats her Woman's Words  That Love that Constancy so ill requited  Upbraids  me to myself I blush to think  How I have us'd him and would shun his Presence  The Motive for this however is neither Justice nor Generosity but Pride indeed it must be own'd a Pride too natural to a Female Mind in such a Circumstance as hers  What will be my Confusion when he sees me  Neglected and forsaken like himself  "Her Insolence at last is well repaid"  I cannot bear the Thought  And then the Moment she sees him this is her blunt Question to him notwithstanding all her Shame to see him  How am I to interpret Sir this Visit  Is it a Compliment of Form or Love  Does this Madam shew any thing of the Delicacy of Sex or Condition And would one think it right after she has thus extorted from him a repeated Confession of his Love or  Weakness  as he calls it to upbraid him that it ill becomes the Embassador of  Greece to talk of Love or Dying  In short Madam I think none of the Love in this Piece is such a Love however suited to  Hermione  's Character and Circumstance as is fit to be recommended to our Example 'Tis a Love that shocks one and is rather Rage and Tumult than Love and succeeds accordingly So that of  Pyrrhus  is ungovern'd wild unjust ungenerous Caprice  Hermione  's is founded in confess'd Ingratitude to  Orestes  and she perseveres in it to  Pyrrhus  when the Indignities put upon her should have made her sooner wish for Death than for so perjur'd a Man and yet I think she shews an inconsistent Tenderness for  Orestes  as I have hinted while her Passion for  Pyrrhus  flames out with so much Violence  The Motive of  Andromache  for hers is the most perfect Character in the Piece and designed to be so by the Poet to save her Son is the best a Woman could have to excuse her for marrying the Man who had slaughter'd all her Relations But the Uncertainty of securing that Point by the mere Formality of joining Hands with  Pyrrhus  and her Resolution to destroy herself in Defiance of her Vows just plighted to be his was a strange Expedient to preserve her Widowhood and her Child For was it very  likely that a Man so wildly in Love with her as to forego all other just and prudent Considerations for her and who had shewn that he would have destroy'd her Son but for the sake of  her  Person would when disappointed by so great a Rashness have hazarded his Realms in Defence of her Son  But of all Things commend me to the noble Regard for  Self  of her Woman and Confidante  Cephisa  to whom  Andromche  communicates her rash Purpose injoining her a willing Secrecy the only way the Poet had to let us know it as it was not put in Execution for she shews that Regard to her dear Self in this tragick Performance which in a Comedy would have raised a Laugh no doubt as a Satire on Lady's Women  Alas I  fear  I never shall outlive you  These Things struck me Madam when I saw the Play and when I came to read it I was more confirm'd in my Sentiments But now I will transcribe some Passages which pleased me much  The Storms and Doubts and Uncertainty of wild ungovern'd Love is very naturally I humbly think painted in several Scenes of this Play in the Characters of  Hermione  and  Pyrrhus  and nowhere more affectingly than in the Upbraidings of  Hermione  to  Orestes  after she found her bloody Purposes too well comply'd with Thus  What if transported by my boundless Passion  I could not bear to see him wed another  Were you t' obey a jealous Woman's Phrensy  You should have div'd into my inmost Thoughts  My Heart tho' full of Rage was free from Malice  And all my Anger was Excess of Love  Why did you take me at my Word You saw  The Struggles of my Soul you heard me rave  You should have question'd me a thousand times  Yet still have doubted still have question'd on  Before you ventur'd on a Life so precious  Why did you not return Why not consult me  A second time And undetermin'd still  Again return and still find new Delays  The Scene between  Andromache  and  Hermione  when the former supposes the latter on the Point of marrying  Pyrrhus  and bespeaking her Interest for her Son's Life affected me much and was nobly acted by Mrs  Oldfield  who after assuring her that her slain Lord's was the only Love she could ever indulge as  Hermione  flies her cries  Ah Madam whither whither do you fly  Where can your Eyes behold a Sight more pleasing  Than  Hector  's Widow suppliant and in Tears  I come not an alarm'd a jealous Foe  To envy you the Heart your Charms have won  But oh I have a Son And you one Day  Will be no Stranger to a Mother's Fondness  Was not this Madam a moving and interesting Plea And is not what follows affectingly noble  But Heav'n forbid that you should ever know  A  Mother  's Sorrow for an  only  Son  Her Joy her Bliss her last surviving Comfort  When ev'ry Hour she trembles for his Life  Your Pow'r o'er  Pyrrhus  may relieve my Fears  Alas what Danger is there in a Child  Sav'd from the Wreck of a whole ruin'd Empire  Let me go hide him in a desart Isle  You may rely upon my tender Care  To keep him far from Perils of Ambition  All he can learn of me will be to weep  This is sweetly moving nobly pathetick But I am angry at the Poet if he could have help'd it for drawing in  Hermione  such an ungenerous and unprincely Insult upon the Royal Mourner when in the Height of her own Prosperity as she imagin'd and her Rival subjected beneath her Feet Fie upon him thus to make her say like a true Woman as our Censurers will reflect  Madam if  Pyrrhus  must be wrought in Pity  No Woman does it better than yourself  If you gain him I shall comply of course  This from one Woman to another much more from one Princess to another from the Elated to the Captive could not be said surely 'Twas all the Poet nor do I see there was need for it For had he made  Hermione  on this Occasion capable her own Empire secured as she thought of a more generous and humane Answer would it not have heighten'd the Distress when such a Character sunk who had been basely injur'd by the Man she lov'd and whose Crime was the Rage or slighted Love Why would he chuse to make  Andromache  's Part thus nobly moving at the Expence of the other Character in a Point where Justice Generosity and Humanity were so much concern'd And would not a fine Instruction have lain here for the Audience to have had Compassion for the Distresses of another and so much the more as that other was a Rival sunk at the Feet of the ProsperousIndeed  Hermione  which by the way Mrs  Porter  acted incomparably is a Character full of Rage and Violence of Jealousy and great Cause she had for it But what then Could she not a Princess as she was when her own Love was secured have been made capable of feeling a Distress so nobly pleaded by Motives so becoming a Mother's Lips and a  bridal Virgin's Prospects But I am upon the Author's Beauties  Andromache  's Plea to  Pyrrhus  when thus insulted by  Hermione  she sees no Hope of any way to preserve her Son but by soothing the proud Heart of the Prince whom her Refusal had incensed is very pretty in the Mouth of Captive Royalty  Oh Sir excuse  The Pride of Royal Blond that cheeks my Soul  And knows not how to be importunate  You know alas I was not born to kneel  To sue for Pity and to own a Master  And afterwards  Behold how low you have reduc'd a Queen  These Eyes have seen my Country laid in Ashes  My Kindred fall in War my Father slain  My Husband dragg'd in his own Blood my Son  Condemn'd to Bondage and myself a Slave  Yet in the midst of these unheardof Woes  'Twas some Relief to find myself  your  Captive  And that my Son deriv'd from antient Kings  Since he must serve had  Pyrrhus  for his Master  When  Priam  kneel'd the great  Achilles  wept  I hop'd I should not find his Son less noble  I thought the Brave were still the most compassionate  O do not Sir divide me from my Child  If he must die  Then there is a fine Scene recollected by  Andromache  to her Woman between  Hector  and herself on the Morning he set out for the Action in which he was slain  That Morn  Cephisa  that illfated Morn  My Husband bid thee bring  Astyanax    He took him in his Arms and as I wept  My Wife my dear  Andromache  said he  Heaving with stifled Sights to see me weep  Finely said and the Hero all preserv'd He sigh'd not for Fear of the Foe but to see his beloved Lady weep From that HUMANITY which should always be inseparable I think whether in Fiction or Fact from true Heroism And that other Inseparable PIETY as follows  What Fortune may attend my Arms the Gods  Alone can tell To thee I give the Boy  Preserve him as the Token of our Loves  If I should fall let him not miss his Sire  While thou surviv'st but by thy tender Care  Let the Son see that thou didst love his Father  And the Advice left by  Andromache  with  Cephisa  for her Son when she resolves to kill herself after the Nuptial Ceremony is perform'dis very worthy after a Scene of passionate Fondness well express'd  Let him know  I  dy'd  to save himAnd would die again  Season his Mind with early Hints of Glory  Make him acquainted with his Ancestors  Trace out their shining Story in his Thoughts  Dwell on th' Exploits of his immortal Father  And sometimes  Very pretty  let him hear his Mother's Name  Let him reflect upon his Royal Birth  With  modest  Pride  Pyrrhus  will prove a Friend  But let him know he has a Conqu'ror's Right  He must be taught to stifle his Resentments  And sacrifice his Vengeance to his Safety  And to his  Gratitude  too Madam should it not have been said when he was so generously protected against the Demand of confederate Kings  Should he prove headstrong rash or unadvis'd  He then would frustrate all his Mother's Virtue  Provoke his Fate and I shall die in vain  Very nobly said But I cannot forbear making one Observation on occasion of Selfmurder which however the Poets may be justify'd by the Examples of the  Greeks  and  Romans  when they draw their Stories from them yet in such a gloomy saturnine Nation as ours where Selfmurders are more frequent than in all the Christian World besides methinks all those Stories should be avoided for publick Entertainment Or where there is a Necessity as in  Cato  for Example to introduce such a wicked Practice the bad Example should be obviated and the Poison it may administer antidoted by more forcible Lessons than what these few doubtful Words express  I fear I've been too hasty  So in this Tragedy I am speaking of when  Hermione  destroys herself and  Andromache  designs to do the like should the  English  Poet have left this Practice unguarded or unaccompany'd by proper Lessons and Censures in such a Country as ours  The staggering Doubts and Distress of  Hermione  after she had ingaged  Orestes  in the Murder of  Pyrrhus  between her Love and her Resentment her Questions to her Woman that as he approach'd the Temple to marry her Rival in Breach of his Vows of Betrothment to her whether his Countenance shewed not some Tokens of Remorse are very natural to one in her amorous Circumstance I fansy  But say  Cleone  didst thou mark him well  Was his Brow smooth Say did there not appear  Some Shade of Grief Some little Cloud of Sorrow  Did he not stop Did he not once look back  Didst  thou  approach him Was he not confounded  Did he notOh be quick and tell me all  This Madam I think is charmingly natural And on  Cleone  's Answer That he went to the Temple all Joy and Transport unguarded and all his Cares imploy'd to gratify  Andromache  in her Son's Safety the Poet palliates a little for a rageful Mind to say  Enough he diesthe TraitorWhere's  Orestes  There are several Circumstances of Horror in this Play that shocked me much but I think none like the Description the Poet puts into the Mouth of  Pylades  the inseparable Friend of  Orestes  who far from avoiding to shock the Soul of his Friend by gently insinuating the Fate of that  Hermione  on whom he had fixed his Happiness thus terribly with all the Aggravations that could attend such a Circumstance points out the horrid Action taking care even to make her as impious in her Reproaches of the Deity for her own Rashness as she was in the Violence by which she dies and so leaving a dreadful Example that I presume was not needful to be left of a final Impenitence especially in a suffering Character that had not merited the Evils she met with  Thus it is mentioned and I am affected with the Transcription of a Passage which the Poet has labour'd more than he ought I think to shew the Force of his descriptive Vein  Full of Disorder Wildness in her Looks  With Hands expanded and dishevell'd Hair  Breathless and pale with Shrieks she sought the Temple  In the Midway she met the Corps of  Pyrrhus  She startled at the Sight Then stiff with Horror  Gaz'd frightful Waken'd from the dire Amaze  She rais'd her Eyes to Heav'n with such a Look  As spoke her Sorrows and  reproach'd the Gods    Then plung'd a Poniard deep within her Breast  And fell on  Pyrrhus  grasping him in Death  This from a Friend to a Lover of the miserable  Hermione  tho' the Poet might think it the only Way he had left to make  Orestes  run quite distracted yet was not I presume to say very judiciously put into the Mouth of a beloved Friend anxious for his Safety and to get him off after the Murder and whose Part till now had been rather that of soothing like a true Friend the Sorrows of his Mind  The Moral of the Story only regards  Andromache  nor is there indeed any thing but Violence and Terror in the rest of the Story and Characters as if the Poet was determin'd to sink all into one and make that great at the Expence of the rest 'Tis however in my humble Opinion a good one to shew that Persons in Distress ought never to despond be their Afflictions what they  will  and ought to have weigh'd with  Andromache  herself to make her avoid the Crime of Suicide which she had resolved upon since this Moral is put into her Mouth but so late that it seems rather to make her good by an Event she could not foresee than by the Prudence of her Reflections which would not without that Event have prevented her from a rash Action that would have rendered the Moral ineffectual  Tho' plung'd in Ills and exercis'd in Care  Yet never let the noble Mind despair  Where press'd by Dangers and beset with Foes  The Gods their timely Succour interpose  And when our Virtue sinks o'erwhelm'd with Grief  By unforeseen Expedients bring Relief  Now Madam good as this Moral is I should rather in Generosity have had it recommended from any Mouth than that of  Andromache  For what is the Consolation she receives What are the Expedients she so much rejoices in Why in the first place the Murder of a Prince who lov'd her more than his own Glory and to whom she had just given her Faith as a second Husband tho' forced to it from a laudable Motive And next The Selfmurder of  Hermione  the Distraction of  Orestes  and the Prospect of succeeding with her Son to the Throne of the murder'd Prince from which however she could not expect but to be driven and her Son at last to be destroy'd by those vengeful Confederates who had joined by a solemn Embassy to demand his Life and who now by his Elevation had stronger Reasons to apprehend Danger from him and the less Difficulty to effect his Ruin as  Pyrrhus  was no more  But judge my dear Lady what after the Play was over I must think of the Epilogue and indeed of the Audience who call'd out for it An Epilogue spoken by Mrs  Oldfield  in the Character of  Andromache  that was more shocking to me than the most terrible Parts of the Play as by lewd and even senseless  Doubleentendre  it could be calculated only to efface all the tender all the virtuous Sentiments which the Tragedy was design'd to raise  The Pleasure this was receiv'd with by the Men was equally barbarous and insulting every one turning himself to the Boxes Pit and Galleries where Ladies were to see how they lock'd and how they stood an emphatical and toowell pronounc'd Ridicule not only upon the Play in general but upon the  Part of  Andromache  in particular which had been so well sustain'd by an excellent Actress and I was extremely mortify'd to see my favourite and the only perfect Character debas'd and despoil'd and the Widow of  Hector  Prince of  Troy  talking Nastiness to an Audience and setting it out with all the wicked Graces of Action and affected Archness of Look Attitude and Emphasis  I stood upDear SirDear Misssaid I  What's the matter my Love said Mr  B  smileing who expected as he told me afterwards to see me mov'd by this vile Epiloguefor it is always call'd for it seems  Why have I wept the Distresses of the injur'd  Hermione  whisper'd I Why have I been mov'd by the Murder of the brave  Pyrrhus  and shock'd by the Madness of  Orestes  Is it for this See you not  Hector  's Widow that noble  Andromache  inverting the Design of the whole Play satirizing her own Sex but indeed most of all ridiculing and shaming in  my  Mind that Part of the Audience who can call for this vile Epilogue and those who can be delighted with it after such Scenes of Horror and Distress  He was pleas'd to say smiling I expected my Dear that your Delicacy and Miss's too would be shock'd on this preposterous Occasion I never saw this Play Rake as I was but the Impropriety of the Epilogue sent me away dissatisfy'd with it and with human Nature too And you only see by this one Instance what a Character that of an Actor and Actress is and how capable they are to personate any thing for a sorry Subsistence  Well but Sir said I are there not think you extravagant Scenes and Characters enough in most Plays to justify the Censures of the Virtuous upon them that the wicked Friend of the Author must crown the Work in an Epilogue for fear the Audience  should go away improv'd by the Representation It is not I see Sir always Narrowness of Spirit as I have heard some say that opens the Mouths of good People against these Diversions  In this wild way talk'd I for I was quite out of Patience at this unnatural and unexpected Piece of Ridicule tack'd to so serious a Play and coming after such a Moral  Here is a Specimen my dear Lady of my Observations on the first Play I saw How just or how impertinent I must leave to your better Judgment I very probably expose my own ignorance and Folly in them but I will not say Presumption because you have put me upon the Task which otherwise I should hardly have attempted I have very little Reason therefore to blame myself on this score but on the contrary if I can escape your Ladyship's Censure have Cause to pride myself in the Opportunity you have thereby given me to shew my Readiness to obey you and the rather since I am sure of your kindest Indulgence now you have given me Leave to style myself  Your Ladyship's obliged Sister And humble Servant  P B  LETTER XV  My dear Lady  I GAVE you in my last my bold Remarks upon a TRAGEDY  The Distress'd Mother  I will now give you my shallow Notions of a COMEDY  The Tender Husband    I lik'd this Title tho' I can't say I was pleas'd at all with its second with an explanatory  OrThe  Accomplish'd Fools  But when I was told it was written by Sir  Richard Steele  and that Mr  Addison  had given some Hints towards it if not some Characters O dear Sir said I give us your Company to this Play for the Authors of the  Spectators  cannot possibly produce a faulty Scene  Mr  B  indeed smil'd for I had not then read the Play And the Earl of  F  his Countess Miss  Darnford  Mr  B  and myself agreed to meet with a Niece of my Lord's in the StageBox which was taken on purpose  There seems to me my dear Lady to be a great deal of Wit and Satire in the Play But upon my Word I was grievously disappointed as to the Morality of it Nor in some Places is  Probability  preserved and there are divers Speeches so very free that I could not have expected to meet with such from the Names I mention'd  I should be afraid of being censur'd for my Presumption were I to write to any body less indulgent to my Boldness than your Ladyship But I will make no Apologies to you MadamLet me see then can I give you the brief History of this Comedy as I did of the TragedyI profess I hardly know whether I can or not at least whether I should or notBut I'll try  The Tender Husband MR CLERIMONT has for his Wife a Lady who has travell'd and is far gone in all the  French  Fashions "She brought me" says he  "a noble Fortune and I thought she had a Right to share it therefore carry'd her to see the World forsooth and make the Tour of  France  and  Italy  where she learn'd to lose her Money gracefully to admire every Vanity in  our  Sex and contemn every Virtue in  her own  which with ten thousand other Perfections are the ordinary Improvements of a travell'd Lady"  Tender as the Husband was to be suppos'd to the Wife which by the way is not extremely apparent in  proper  or  right  Instances of Tenderness I presume to think he shews no great Delicacy to the Sex in general in this Speech  But what is the Method he takes to reclaim the LadyWhy this He sets a former Mistress of his own to work in Man's Cloaths to insnare his Lady And thus he declares himself  "Now I can neither mortify her Vanity that I may live at Ease with her or quite  discard  her till I have catch'd her a little inlarging her innocent Freedoms as she calls them For this End I am content to be a  French  Husband tho' nowandthen with the secret Pangs of an  Italian  one and therefore Sir or Madam"  to his Mistress LUCY under the Name of MR FAINLOVE in the Dress of a young Coxcomb  "you are thus equipp'd to attend and accost her Ladyship"  A Speech unnecessary to  Fainlove  who was dress'd before for that Purpose and had actually won Money in that Character of Mrs  Clerimont  But the Poet had no other way to let the Audience know it as it should seem"It concerns you" continues he  "to be diligent If we  ie  he and his Lady wholly partI need say  no more  If we do  not  I'll see thee  well provided  for"  Here's a fine moral Scene open'd my Lady with regard to Mr  Clerimont  his Lady and his kept Mistress Mr  Fainlove  alias Mrs  Lucy  undertakes the Task in Hopes to live with Mr  Clerimont  in case of a Divorce from his Wife or to be provided for in case the Plot does not succeed Which looks pretty plainly that to say nothing of his Morality the poor  Lucy  had not met with a generous Man in Mr  Clerimont  since after the Forfeiture of her Honour she was still to do a  more infamous Jobb if possible to procure for herself a Provision from him  Then Mr  Clerimont  proceeds to in ctruct the newmade Man how to behave like a Coxcomb in order to ingage his Lady's Attention and to join in all her Foibles till she can furnish him with an Opportunity to detect them in such a way as shall give a Pretence for a Divorce and this in such free Language and Action as must disgust any modest Body  Then the Poet causes this faithful Mistress in order to make her Character shine above that of the Wife and indeed above his own likewise to present her Imployer with Bills for  l  which she tells him she won of his Wife the preceding Night and makes up  l  which Mr  Clerimont  says this unprovidedfor Mistress of his has won from his Lady and honestly given him or else he could not he says have supply'd her Gaming Losses And  Lucy  declares she will gain him for ever from his Lady if she can Yet you'll see byandby that it is not Love to his particular Person more than any other that is her Inducement Of course then it must be Wickedness for Wickedness sake  The next Character is CAPTAIN CLERIMONT Brother to the other Gentleman a Man of Fashion and the World who being a younger Brother has his Fortune to make and we shall see presently how he proposes to make it  The next is POUNCE an infamous Jobber or Broker of Stocks Marriages or any thingwhose Character be pleas'd to take in his own Words  "Now 'tis my Profession to assist a  freehearted  young Fellow against an  unnatural longliv'd  Fatherto disincumber Men of Pleasure of the Vexation of unwieldy Estates to support a feeble Title to an Inheritance"  One that Mr  Clerimont  says by way of Praise he has seen prompting a stammering Witness in  Westminsterhall  that wanted Instruction and could venture his Ears with great Bravery for his Friend  A worse Character than this can there be Yet is it not produc'd to be punished neither  The next Person introduc'd is HEZEKIAH TIPKIN a Banker in  Lombardstreet  of an infamous and sordid Character and a vile Usurer Who has a beautiful Niece Miss BRIDGET TIPKIN overrun with Affectation and Romance with a great Fortune in Money which so attracts the Captain that he supposes in sordid but witty manner enough all imaginable Perfections in her Person before he has a Sight of it This young Lady by a Treaty between her Uncle  Tipkin  and Sir HARRY GUBBIN a tyrannical positive hotheaded Country Gentleman is design'd to be marry'd to HUMPHREY the Son of Sir  Harry  a Creature so savage so rough and so stupid that there cannot be drawn a stronger Contraste between his Character and that of Miss  Bridget  's  Mr  Pounce  who is imploy'd as a Broker in  their  Match is for a Reward of  l  to cheat them and poor  Humphrey  and to procure this young Lady for Captain  Clerimont  Admirable Justice and Morality all round you'll say my Lady For this Purpose Mr  Pounce  finds Mr  Humphrey  so great a Fool that tho' he never saw him before he very esily sets him against his Father and against his Cousin  Bridget  and all this on the Weddingday in order to induce him to make Court to a Person he tells him of but never saw And who should be this Person but the Sister of  Fainlove Clerimont  's Mandress'd Mistress which Sister however was to be  Fainlove  or  Lucy  herself with a worthy Intent to impose upon him as a Wife this castoff Mistress  of  Clerimont  A just a generous an exemplary Plot this  The next Character is an old Maiden Gentlewoman AUNT to Miss  Bridget  an antiquated Virgin who as  Pounce  says has a mighty Affectation for Youth and is a great Lover of Men and Money and she is set over her Niece as a Promoter of the Match with  Humphrey  Over this Lady Mr  Pounce  has a great Ascendant half for sordid Reasons and half for amorous ones which makes her a thorough ridiculous Character and he introduces Captain  Clerimont  into the Company of the Aunt and Niece and entertains the former while the Captain ingages the latter on the Subject of her beloved Romance These with Mrs  Clerimont  's Maid  Jenny  are the principal Characters  I need not my Lady take up much of your Time or my own to tell you how they proceed  Mr  Clerimont  then after bearing from his Wife what hardly any Gentleman could bear surprises  Fainlove  as a Man and a very wicked Scene it is in every Part taking shocking Freedoms with her And falling into a feigned Rage threatening to kill  Fainlove  the Lady at first menaces and is haughty and arrogant but finding by her Husband's Behaviour to  Lucy  whom he then addresses with Fondness before her Face that she is trick'd by a Woman in Man's Habit in her Turn would kill the Impostor as  Lucy  whom as  Fainlove  she try'd to save and a Scene on this Occasion occurs to my thinking very ridiculous Mr  Clerimont  then upbraids her Guilt and what was hardly ever known in Nature she reforms  instantly  on the Spot and expresses all the Signs of Contrition imaginable He forgives and receives her guilty as she is in her Intention her Person only untainted and an Adultress in her Mind as she would have been in Fact had  Fainlove  been a Man And a moving Scene had it been from proper Motives follows  Yet  still more preposterous excuse me Madam afterwards she resumes all her travell'd and nonsensical Airs all her Follies to help to support the Piot in favour of Captain  Clerimont  upon Miss  Bridget  and that of  Pounce  's and Mr  Clerimont  's against poor  Humphry  the only  innocent  Character in the Play and the only  suffering  one and this latter as well as the former Plot being brought about a laughing Scene is produced by Sir  Harry  's soundly cudgelling his stupid Son for permitting himself to be so foolishly drawn in  Now my good Lady can you see one Character and I think I have given them justly fit to be set up for an Example in this celebrated Play of an Author so celebrated I must own as I said before I was greatly disappointed in my Expectations of it There is indeed a great deal of sprightly Wit and Knowlege of the wicked Part of the World display'd in it as it seems to me by what I have heard Mr  B  talk sometimes but there is not one Character in it but what is shockingly immoral and at the same time either  above  or  below  Nature so that the Ridicule which is intended in it on the bad Characters cannot in my poor Opinion be just or efficacious  For first there never I believe could be a Gentleman so foolishly tender yet so plottingly cruel to his Lady as Mr  Clerimont    There never could be such a very fantastical Lady as Mrs  Clerimont  And there is such an Improbability in the intimate Access which  Lucy  in Man's Cloaths has to her in that Creature's lewd Views yet faithful and generous Conduct in giving back to  Clerimont  who had not provided for her  l  won of the fantastical Lady and yet in her being so  little delicate in her  Love  to  Clerimont  which one would expect should be her Motive as to join to trick and marry one of the greatest Fools in the World that it was surprising to me that it could pass either Author or Audience  Then  Tipkin  's Character is unnaturally stupidly yet knavishly bad  Sir  Harry Gubbin  is a Father who never could have his Fellow and after furiously bearing his Son is reconciled to his Marriage as instantly as Mrs  Clerimont  is converted and that to an unknown Person who appears to  him  in Man's Cloaths for the sake of  l  Fortune only altho' he had been quarrelling with  Tipkin  about  l  out of  l  which his Son was to have with  Bridget    Numps  his Son is a Character take it all together quite out of Nature and Probability 'Tis hardly possible that a Savage brought up in a Wood who never convers'd with Man or Woman could be so stupid and easily might a Poet form a Plot for a Play if such a Character could be admitted as  Numps  's  The Aunt is credulous and affected beyond Probability also  Miss  Bridget  delicately indelicate in many Places and improbably fantastick in all  Pounce  shamelessly glorying and  succeeding  in his Villainy and deeming the worst of Rogueries a Panegyrick And such Immoralities mingled with Obscenities that I was glad when the Play was over  But yet to say Truth there are very pretty Descriptions and a great deal of Wit and Humour in it The Dialogue is lively The Painter's Scene entertaining and that between Sir  Harry  and  Tipkin  diverting tho' low which together with the fantastick Airs of Mrs  Clerimont  and Miss  Bridget  and the farcical Humours of  Numps  make it the less  Wonder that such as did not attend to Nature Probability and Morality were struck with the Life and Spirit of the Performance And especially as Mr  Wilks  who acted Captain  Clerimont  and Mrs  Oldfield  who acted Miss  Bridget  so incomparably perform'd their Parts as must have saved a Play even of a worse Tendency than the  Accomplish'd Fools    The Moral I will transcribe altho' I doubt it is a very inapplicable one to the Characters and so is far from making Amends for a long Performance that in such a Variety of Characters has not  one  moral one in it not so much as one just or generous Design pursued throughout the Play  You've seem th' Extremes of the domestick Life  A Son too much confin'dtoo free a Wife  By gen'rous Bonds you either should restrain  And only on their Inclinations gain  This I call inapplicable because it was needless Advice to such Husbands as Mr  Clerimont  for whom it seems design'd for he was generous to Excess carrying her abroad to  Italy  and  France  and paying all her Debts of Honour implicitly Whence the Name of the Play  The Tender Husband    Wives to obey must LOVE  Clerimont  did everything to make a grateful Woman love him before his strange Plot to reclaim her  Children  REVERE  While only  SLAVES  are govern'd by their Fear  Mrs  Clerimont  was not treated like a  Slave  yet is reclaim'd only by  Fear  So that the Moral seems to be calculated for the  Numps  's the Fools and Idiots and the Sir  Harries  two Characters that as I humbly  apprehend never were in Nature any more it is to be hoped than are the rest  It looks to me in short as if the Author had forgot the Moral all the way and being put in mind of it by some kind Friend Mr  Addison  perhaps was at a Loss to draw one from such Characters and Plots as he had produc'd and so put down what came uppermost for the sake of Custom without much regard to Propriety And truly I should imagine likewise that the Play was begun with a Design to draw more amiable Characters answerable to the Title of  The Tender Husband  but that the Author being drawn away by the Luxuriancy of a Genius which he had not the Heart to prune on a general Survey of the Whole distrusting the Propriety of that Title added the underone With an OR  The Accomplish'd Fools  in Justice to his Piece and Compliment to his Audience And pardon me Madam had he called it  The Accomplish'd Knaves  I would not have been angry at him because there would have been more Propriety in the Title  I wish I could for the sake of the Authors have praised every Scene of this Play I hoped to have Reason for it Judge then my dear Lady what a Mortification it was to me not to be able to say I liked above one the  Painter's Scene  and am forc'd to disapprove of every Character in it and the Views of every one I am dearest Madam  Your most obliged Sister and Servant  P B  LETTER XVI  My dear Lady  ALTHO' I cannot tell how you receiv'd my Observations on the Tragedy of  The Distress'd Mother  and the Comedy of  The tender Husband    yet will I proceed to give your Ladyship my Opinion of the Opera I was at last Night  But what can I say when I have mention'd what you so well know the fine Scenes the genteel Company the charming Voices and delightful Musick  If Madam like the Nightingale one were all Voice or were all Ear and lost to every Sense but that and Harmony surely the  Italian  Opera would be a transporting Thing But when one finds good Sense and Instruction and Propriety sacrific'd to the Charms of Sound what an unedifying what a mere temporary Delight does it afford For what does one carry home but the Remembrance of having been pleas'd so many Hours by Air well beaten and play'd upon which being but Sound you cannot bring away with you and must therefore enter the Time pass'd in such a Diversion into the Account of those blank Hours from which one has not reap'd so much as one improving Lesson  I speak this with regard to myself who know nothing of the  Italian  Language But yet I may not be very unhappy that I do not if I may form my Opinion of the Sentiments by the enervating Softness of the Sound and the unmanly Attitudes and Gestures made use of to express the Passions of the MenPerformers and from the amorous Complainings of the Women as visible in the soft the toosoft Action of each  Then tho' I cannot but say That the Musick is most melodious yet to see a Hero as an  Alexander  or a  Julius Caesar  warbling out his Achievements in War his military Conquests as well as his Love in a soft Song it seems to me to be making a Jest of both  And how much more absurd is it still to hear some dying Chieftain some unfortunate Hero chanting forth his Woes and his Calamities and taking  his Leave of the World with less Propriety than our  English  Criminals at the fatal Tree in a Sonetta What can this move how can this  pierce  be the Story ever so dismal any thing but one's Ears  Every Nation Mr  B  says has its peculiar Excellence The  French  Taste is Comedy and Harlequinery the  Italian  Melody and Opera the  English  masculine and nervous Sense whether in Tragedy or Comedy Why can't one methinks keep to one's own particular national Excellence and let others retain theirs For Mr  B  observes That when once Sound is preferr'd to Sense we shall depart from all our own Worthiness and at best be but the Apes yea the Dupes of those whom we may  strive  to imitate but never can reach much less excel  Mr  B  says sometimes that this Taste is almost the only good Fruit our young Nobility gather and bring home from their foreign Tours and that he found the  English  Nation much ridicul'd on this Score by those very People who are benefited by the Depravity And if this be the best what must the other Qualifications be which they bring home Yet every one does not return with so little Improvement it is to be hop'd  But what have I said what can I say of an  Italian  OperaOnly little to the Purpose as it is I wonder how I have been able to say so much For who can describe Sound Or what Words shall be found to imbody AirAnd when we return and are ask'd our Opinion of what we have seen or heard we are only able to answer as I hinted above The Scenery is fine The Company splendid and genteel The Musick charming for the Time The Action not extraordinary The Language unintelligible and for all these ReasonsThe Instruction none at all  This is all that the Thing itself gives me to say of the  Italian  Opera very probably for want of a polite Taste and a Knowlege of the Language  In my next I believe I shall give you Madam my Opinion of a Diversion or Amusement which I doubt I shall like still less and that is a  Masquerade  for I fear I shall not be excus'd going to one altho' I have no manner of Liking to it especially in my present Way I am Madam  Your Ladyship's most obliged and faithful  P B  I must add another Halfsheet to this Letter on the Subjectmatter of it the Opera and am sure your Ladyship will not be displeased with the Addition  Mr  B  coming up just as I had concluded my Letter asked me What was my Subject I told him I was giving your Ladyship my Notions of the  Italian  Opera Let me see said he what they are my Dear for this is a Subject that very few of those who admire them and fewer still of those who decry them know any thing of  He read the above and was pleased to commend it  Italian  Operas said be are very sad Things in  England  to what they are in  Italy  And the Translations given of them abominable and indeed our Language will not do them Justice  Every Nation as you take notice has its Excellencies and you say well that ours should not quit the manly nervous Sense which is the Distinction of the  English  Drama One Play of our celebrated  Shakespeare  will give infinitely more Pleasure to a sensible Mind than a dozen  English Italian  Operas But my Dear in  Italy  they are quite another Thing And the Sense is not as here sacrific'd so  much to the Sound but that they are both very compatible  Be pleased Sir to give me your Observation on this Head in Writing and then I shall have something to send worthy of Lady  Davers  's Acceptation Do Sir pray do  I will my Dear and he took the Pen in his Hand and wrote the inclosed which I beg your Ladyship to return me because I will keep it by me for my Instruction if I should be led to talk of this Subject in Company You must let my Sister know said he that I have given myself no Time to reperuse what I have written She will do well therefore to correct it and return it to you  "In  Italy  Judges of Operas are so far from thinking the Drama a Poetical Part of their Opera's Nonsense as the Unskilled in  Italian  rashly conclude in  England  that if the  Libretto  as they call it is not approved the Opera notwithstanding the Excellence of the Musick will be condemned For the  Italians  justly determine that the very Musick of an Opera cannot be complete and pleasing if the Drama be incongruous as I may call it in its Composition because in order to please it must have the necessary Contraste of the Grave and Light that is the Diverting equally blended through the Whole If there be too much of the first let the Musick express as I may say Love and the Tender ever so much it will come out heavy and tiresome if the latter prevail it will surfeit with Jig and Minuit Wherefore it is the Poet's Business to adapt the Words for this agreeable Mixture For the Musick is but secondary and subservient to the Words and if there be an artful Contraste in the Drama there will be the same in the Musick supposing the Composer to be a skilful Master  "Now as in  England  the Practice has been to mutilate curtail and patch up a Drama in  Italian  in order to throw in a Glut of minuitish Airs collected from an Author the Contraste has always been broken thereby and the Opera damn'd without knowing the Reason And as ignorant mercenary Prompters tho'  Italians  have been imploy'd in the Hotchpotch and in translating our Drama's from  Italian  into  English  how could such Opera's appear any other than incongruous Nonsense  Recitativo's  "To avoid the natural Dissonance and Irregularity in common Speech Recitativo's in Musick and dramatical Performances were invented and altho' the Time in pronouncing the Words contain'd in them is scarce longer than in common Conversation yet the Concatenation of Sounds is by this Means so artfully contrived as that the Cadences or Dialogue of Basses shall unite and delight the Ear with their Opposites the highest Tenors and Trebles Wherefore Recitativo's are a regular way of speaking by Art as I may say in order to avoid and correct the Irregularities of Speech often found in Nature and to express the Passions without Offence to the Ear"  Permit me dear Madam to repeat my Assurances that I am and must ever be  Your obliged Sister and Servant  P B  LETTER XVII  WELL now my dear Lady I will give you my poor Opinion of a Masquerade to which Mr  B  persuaded me to accompany Miss  Darnford  for  as I hinted in my former I had a great Indifference or rather Dislike to go and Miss therefore wanted so powerful a Second to get me with her because I was afraid the Freedoms which I had heard were used there would not be very agreeable to my apprehensive Temper at  this  Time especially  But finding Mr  B  chose to have me go if as he was pleased to say I had no Objection I said I  will  have none Sir I  can  have none when you tell me it is your Choice and so send for the Habits you like and that you would have me appear in and I will chearfully attend you  The Habit Mr  B  pitch'd upon was that of a  Spanish  Don and it well befitted the Majesty of his Person and Air and Miss chose that of a young Widow and Mr  B  recommended that of a Quaker for me We all admir'd one another in our Dresses and Mr  B  promising to have me always in his Eye we took Coach and went thither  But I never desire to be present at another Mr  B  was singled out by a bold Nun who talk'd  Italian  to him with such free Airs that I did not much like it tho' I know not what she said for I thought the dear Gentleman no more kept to his  Spanish  Gravity than she to the Requisites of the Habit she wore When I had imagin'd that all that was tolerable in a Masquerade was the acting up to the Characters each Person assum'd And this gave me no Objection to the Quaker's Dress for I thought I was prim enough for that naturally  I said softly Dear Miss for Mr  B  and the Nun were out of Sight in a Moment What is become of that Nun Rather whisper'd she What is become of the  Spaniard  A Cardinal attack'd me instantly in  French  But I answer'd in  English  not knowing what he said Quakers are not fit Company for Redhats  They are said he in the same Language for a Quaker and a Jesuit is the same Thing  Miss was address'd by the Name of the sprightly Widow Another ask'd How long she intended to wear those Weeds And a Footman in a rich Livery answer'd for her Eyes thro' her Mask that it would not be a Month  But I was startled when a Presbyterian Parson came up to me and bid me look after my  Musidorus  So that I doubted not by this it must be somebody who knew my Name to be  Pamela  and I presently thought of one of my Lawyers whose Characters I gave in a former Letter  Indeed he needed not to bid me for I was sorry on more Accounts than that of my Timorousness to have lost Sight of him Out upon these nasty Masquerades thought I I can't abide them already  An egregious beauish Appearance came up to Miss and said You hang out a very pretty  Sign  Widow  Not reply'd Miss to invite such Fops as you to my Shop  Any Customer would be welcome return'd he in my Opinion I whisper this as a Secret  And I whisper another said Miss That no Place warrants ill Manners  Are you angry Widow  She affected a Laugh No indeed it i'n't worth while  He turn'd to meand I was afraid of some such Hit as he gave meI hope Friend thou art prepar'd with a Father for the Light within thee That was his free Word  Is this Wit said I turning to Miss I have enough of this Diversion where nothing but coarse Jests appear  barefac'd    At last Mr  B  accosted us as if he had not known us So lovely a Widow and so sweet a Friend no wonder you do not separate For I see not in this various Assemblée a third Person of your Sex fit to join with you  Not one Sir said I Will not a penitent Nun make a good Third with a mournful Widow and a prim Quaker  Not for more than Ten Minutes at most  Instantly the Nun a fine Person of a Lady with a noble Air tho' I did not like her join'd us and spoke in  Italian  something very free as it seem'd by her Manner and Mr  B  's smiling Answer but neither Miss nor I understood that Language and Mr  B  would not explain it to us  But she gave him a Signal to follow her seeming to be much taken with his Person and Air for tho' there were three other  Spanish  Habits there he was call'd  The stately Spaniard  by one and  The handsome Spaniard  by another in our Hearing as he pass'd with us to the Dessert where we drank each of us a Glass of Champaign and eat a few Sweetmeats with a Croud about us but we appear'd not to know one another While several odd Appearances as One  Indian  Prince One  Chinese  Mandarin several Domine's of both Sexes a  Dutch  Skipper a  Jewish  Rabbi a  Greek  Monk an Harlequin a  Turkish  Bashaw and a  Capuchin  Frier glided by us as we return'd into Company signifying that we were Strangers to them by squeaking out  I know you  Which is half the Wit of the Place  Mr  B  had more Attacks made upon him by Ladies than we had by Gentlemen and his fine Person noble Air and a Deportment so suited to his Habit only in the Encounter of the Nun when he had more of the  French  Freedom as I thought than the  Spanish  Gravity made him many Admirers  and more when the  Spanish  Minister who was there in a  French  Dress spoke to him in  Spanish  and receiv'd a polite Answer from him in the same while there were several who personated Foreign Characters and knew nothing of the Language of the Country whose Habits they assumed  There were divers Antick Figures some with Caps and Bells one dress'd like a Punch several Harlequins and other ludicrous Forms that jump'd and ran about like mad and seem'd as if they would have it thought that all their Wit lay in their Heels  Two Ladies one in a very fantastick partycolour'd Habit with a Plume of Feathers the other in a rustick one with a Garland of Flowers round her Head were much taken notice of for their Freedom and having something to say to every body They were as seldom separated as Miss and I and were follow'd by a Croud whereever they went  The partycolour'd one came up to me Friend said she there is something in thy Person that attracts every one's Notice But if a Sack had not been a profane Thing it would have become thee almost as well  I thank thee Friend said I for thy Counsel but if thou hadst been pleas'd to look at home thou wouldst not have taken so much Pains to join such Advice and such an Appearance together as thou makest  This made every one that heard it laugh One said The Butterfly had met with her Match  She return'd with an affected Laugh Smartly said But art thou come hither Friend to make thy Light shine before Men or Women  Verily Friend neither reply'd I but out of mere Curiosity to look into the  Minds  of both Sexes which I read in their  Dresses    A general Satire on the Assemblée by the Mass said a fat Monk  The Nun whisk'd to us We're all concern'd in my Friend's Remark  And no Disgrace to a fair Nun return'd I if her Behaviour answer her Dress Nor to a Reverend Frier turning to the Monk if his Mind be not a Discredit to his Appearance Nor yet to a Country Girl turning to the partycolour'd Lady's Companion if she has not Weeds in her Heart to disgrace the Flowers on her Head  An odd Figure representing a  Merry Andrew  took my Hand and said I had the most piquant Wit he had met with that Night And Friend said he let us be better acquainted  Forbear said I withdrawing my Hand not a Companion for a Jackpudden neither  A  Roman  Senator just then accosted Miss and Mr  B  seeing me so much ingag'd 'Twere hard said he if our Nation in Spite of  Cervantes  produc'd not one Cavalier to protect a fair Lady thus surrounded  Tho' surrounded not distress'd my good KnightErrant said the Nun The fair Quaker will be too hard for half a dozen Antagonists and wants not your Protection But your poor Nun bespeaks it whisper'd she who has not a Word to say for herself  Mr  B  answer'd her in  Italian  I wish I understood  Italian  and she had recourse to her Beads  You can't imagine Madam how this Nun haunted the dear GentlemanIndeed my Lady you can't imagine it  I must needs say I don't like these Masquerades at all Many Ladies on these Occasions are so very free that the Censorious will be apt to blame the whole Sex for  their  Conduct and to say their Hearts are as faulty as those of the most culpable Men since they scruple not to shew as much when  they think they cannot be known by their Faces But it is my humble Opinion that could there be a Standard fix'd by which one could determine readily what  is  and what is  not  Wit Decency would not be so often wounded by Attempts to be witty as it is For here every one that can give himself the Liberty to say Things that shock a modester Person not meeting with due Rebuke but perhaps a Smile without considering whether it be of Contempt or Approbation mistakes Courage for Wit and every thing sacred or civil becomes the Subject of his frothy Jest  How else can one account for the Liberties of Expression and Behaviour taken by some of those who personated Bishops Cardinals Priests Nuns  c  For the freest Things I heard said were from Persons in those Habits who behav'd with so much Levity and Indecorum as if they were resolved as much as in them lay to throw those venerable Characters into Ridicule for no other Reason than because they are by the Generality of the World deem'd  venerable  But if it was once determin'd that nothing should be call'd true Wit as nothing certainly ought but what will stand the Test of Examination but what is consistent with Decency and good Manners and what will make an innocent Heart brilliant and chearful and give its Sanction to the happy Expression by trying to keep up and return the Ball in like virtuous and lively Raillery then we should have our publick Entertainments such as the most Scrupulous might join to countenance and applaud  But what a Moralizer am I will your Ladyship say Indeed I can't help it And especially on such a Subject as a  Masquerade  which I dislike more than any thing I ever saw I could say a great deal more on this Occasion but upon my Word I am quite  of Humour with it for I liked my  English  Mr  B  better than my  Spaniard  and the Nun I approved not by any means tho' there were some who observed that she was one of the gracefullest Figures in the Place And indeed in spite of my own Heart I could not help thinking so too  Your Ladyship knows so well what  Masquerades  are that I may well be excus'd saying any thing further on a Subject I am so little pleased with For you only desire my Notions of those Diversions because I am a Novice to them and this I doubt not will doubly serve to answer that Purpose  I shall only therefore add That after an hundred other Impertinencies spoken to Miss and me and retorted with Spirit by Miss and as well as I could by myself quite sick of the Place I feign'd to be more indisposed than I was and so got my beloved  Spaniard  to go off with us and reached Home by Three in the Morning And so much for  Masquerades  I hope I shall never have Occasion to mention them again to your Ladyship I am my dearest Lady  Your everobliged Sister and Servant  P B  LETTER XVIII  My dearest Lady  MY Mind is so wholly ingross'd by Thoughts of a very different Nature from those which the Diversions of the Town and Theatres inspire that I beg to be dispens'd for the present from these lighter Subjects But yet if it please God to spare my Life as your Ladyship does not disapprove of my Remarks I intend to make a little Book which I will present to your Ladyship containing my poor Observations  on all the Dramatick Entertainments I have seen and shall see this Winter and for this Purpose I have made brief Notes in the Margin of the printed Plays I have bought as I saw them with a Pencil by referring to which as Helps to my Memory I shall be able to give your Ladyship my Thoughts at the Time of seeing them pretty nearly with the same Advantage as if I had written them at my Return from each  I have obtained of Sir  Simon  and Lady  Darnford  the very great Pleasure of their Permission to Miss to stay with me till it shall be seen how it will please God to deal with me and I owe this Favour partly to a kind Letter written in my Behalf to Sir  Simon  by Mr  B  and partly to Miss's earnest Request to her Papa to oblige me Sir  Simon  haveing made some Difficulty to comply as Mr  Murray  and his Bride have left them and he says he cannot live long if he has not the Company of his beloved Daughter  I cannot but say I have many more Anxieties and Apprehensions than perhaps I ought on the approaching Occasion but I was always a sad Coward and too thoughtful a good deal But I have so  much  to lose such a dear dear Gentleman to part with if I  must  part with him such generous Friends and Lovers as I may say of both Sexes And then the Circumstance itself has so many Terrors to an apprehensive Mind attending it that I am out of Breath sometimes at the Thoughts of it and want to run away from myself if I could But it cannot be and when I charge my Mind with the Reflections that Religion inspires and ask myself Who it was that gave me all these Blessings and Who it is that has a Right to recall them if He pleases and  when  and in  what way  He pleases and that if I leave them not  now  I must be separated  from them  another  Day I endeavour to bring my Mind to a Resignation to the Divine Will  But what shall I say Madam when I find my Frailty is so much increased that I cannot with the same Intenseness of Devotion that I used to be blest with apply myself to the Throne of Grace nor of Consequence find my Invocations answer'd by that Delight and inward Satisfaction with which I used to please myself when the present near Prospect was more remote  I hope I shall not be deserted in the Hour of Trial and that this my Weakness of Mind will not be punish'd with a spiritual Dereliction for suffering myself to be too much attach'd to those worldly Delights and Pleasures which no Mortal ever injoy'd in a more exalted Degree than myself And I beseech you my dearest Lady let me be always remember'd in your Prayers  Only  for a Resignation to the Divine Will a  chearful  Resignation I presume not to prescribe to His gracious Providence for if one has but  that  one has every thing that one need to have Yet my dear Lady there is such a natural Repugnance between Life and Death that Nature will shrink when one comes to the Trial let one have never so much Fortitude at a Distance Yet I hope I may be forgiven for nowandthen I comfort myself with the Divine Exemplar which prayed in bloody Sweats for the bitter Cup to be removed but gave us the Example of Resignation that I am wishing to be able to follow  However not mine but thy Will be done  Forgive me my dearest Lady for being so deeply serious I have just now been contending with a severe Pang that is for the present gone off what Effect its Return may have God only knows And if this is the last Line I shall ever write it will be the more satisfactory to me as with my humble  Respects to my good Lord  Davers  and the dear Countess and praying for the Continuance of all your Healths and Happiness both here and hereafter I am permitted to subscribe myself  Your Ladyship's obliged Sister and humble Servant  P B  LETTER XIX From Lady  DAVERS  to Mr  B  My dearest Brother  ALTHO' I believe it is needless to put a Gentleman of your generous Spirit in mind of doing a worthy Action yet as I do not know whether you have thought of what I am going to hint to you I cannot forbear a Line or two with regard to the good old Couple in  Kent    I am sure if for our Sins God Almighty should take from us my incomparable Sister forgive me my dear Brother but to intimate what  may  be altho' I hourly pray as her trying Minute approaches that it will not you will for her sake take care that her honest Parents have not the Loss of your Favour to deepen the inconsolable one they will have in such a Case of the best of Daughters  I say I am sure you will do as generously by them as ever And I dare say your sweet  Pamela  doubts it not Yet as you know how sensible she is of every Favour done to them it is the Countess's Opinion and mine and Lady  Betty  's too that you give her this Assurance in some  legal  Way for as she is naturally apprehensive and thinks more of her Circumstance than for your sake she chuses to express to you it will be like a Cordial to her  dutiful and grateful Heart and I do not know if it will not contribute more than any  one  Thing to make her go thro' her Task with Ease and Safety  I know how much your Heart is wrapp'd up in the dear Creature And you are a worthy Brother to let it be so You will excuse me therefore I am sure for this my Officiousness  I have no Doubt that God will spare her to us because altho' we may not be worthy of so much Excellence yet we now all unite so gratefully to thank Him for such a worthy Relation that I hope we shall not be depriv'd of an Example so necessary to us all  I can have but one Fear and that is that young as she is she seems ripen'd for Glory she seems to have liv'd long enough for  herself  But for  You  and for  Us  that God will  still  spare her shall be the hourly Prayer of  My dear worthy Brother  Your ever affectionate Sister  B DAVERS  Have you got her Mother with you I hope you have God give you a Son and Heir if it be his blessed Will But however that be preserve your PAMELA to you For you never can have such  another  Wife  LETTER XX From Mrs  B  to Mr  B  My ever dear and ever honoured Mr  B  AS I know not how it may please God Almighty to deal with me on the approaching Occasion I should think myself inexcusable if I could not  find one or two select Hours to dedicate to you out of the very many in the writing Way in which your Goodness has indulged me because you saw I took Delight in it  But yet think not O best Beloved of my Heart that I have any Boon to beg any Favour to ask either for myself or for my Friends or so much as the  Continuance  of your Favour to the one or the other As to them you have prevented and exceeded all my Wishes As to myself if it please God to spare me I know I shall always be rewarded beyond my Desert let my Deservings be what they will I have only therefore to acknowlege with the deepest Sense of your Goodness to me and with the most Heartaffecting Gratitude that from the happy the thrice happy Hour that you so generously made me yours till  this  Moment you have not left me one Thing on my own Part to wish for but the Continuance and Increase of your Felicity and that I might be worthier and worthier of the unexampled Goodness Tenderness and Condescension wherewith you have always treated me  No my dearest my best beloved Master Friend Husband my  first  my  last  and  only  Love believe me I have nothing to wish for but your Honour and Felicity temporary and eternal and I make no doubt that God in his infinite Goodness and Mercy will perfect his own good Work begun in your dear Heart and whatever may now happen give us a happy Meeting never more to part from one another For altho' as you were pleased to question t'other Day when you were resolving some of my Doubtsand Oh what a sweet Expositor have you been to me upon all those Occasions on which my diffident Mind led me to you for Information and Direction whether the Happiness of the Blessed was not too exalted an Happiness to be subjected to  the poor Ties of Relationship and Sense which now delight and attach so much to them our narrow Minds and Conceptions yet cannot I willingly give up the pleasing the  charming  Hope that I shall one Day rejoice  distinguishingly  rejoice in the Society of my best beloved Husband and Friend and in that of my dear Parents and I will keep and incourage this dear Hope so consolatory to us in the Separation which dearest Friends  must  experience so long as it can stand me in any stead and till I shall be all Intellect and above the soothing Impressions which are now so agreeable to Sense and to conjugal and filial Piety  Let me then beg of you my dearest Protector and best Friend to pardon all my Imperfections and Defects and if ever since I have had the Honour to be yours I have in  Looks  or in  Word  or in  Deed  given you Cause to wish me other than I was that you will kindly put it to the Score of natural Infirmity for in Thought or Intention I can truly boast I never wilfully err'd Your Tenderness for me and your generous Politeness to me always gave me Apprehension that I was not what you wish'd me to be because you would not find Fault with me so often as I fear I deserved And this makes me beg of you to do as I hope God Almighty will pardon all my involuntary Errors and Omissions  You have inabled me Sir to do all the Good to my poor Neighbours and to distressed Objects that was in my own Heart to do and I hope I have dispensed the Power you have so generously intrusted to my Disposal without Extravagance or Dishonour with regard to you and with Comfort and Suitableness to the particular Cases recommended to me But yet as it is necessary I should render some Account of my Stewardship in relation to the large Sums you  have put into my Hands for charitable Uses you will find my beloved  Master  and best  Friend  your poor  Steward  's Accounts of every thing in the Cabinet that was my honoured Lady's till your Goodness made it mine in a  See  Vol II  p    Vellom Book which is written on the first Leaf Titlepage wise Humble RETURNS for DIVINE MERCIES and you will see a Balance struck down to this very Day and the  little Surplus  in the green Purse upon the Book And if you will be pleased Sir to perfect by your Generosity the Happiness of the Cases I have marked with a Star thus * which are such as are not fully recover'd and will be pleased to keep up my little School I dare ask no more for my dearest Mr  B  if I should be called from  your Service  to my  new Place  your  next  Steward and long I hope for your honourable Family's sake you will not be without one may find out another and  better  Method for your Honour and her own to dispense your Bounty than that I have taken  The rich Jewels and Equipage with which your generous Goodness adorned my Unworthiness will be found in the same Cabinet in the private Drawer And if I may be pardon'd for one extravagant Wish your Circumstances dear Sir are very great and your future Lady will not wear any thing that was mine it is that my dear Miss  Darnford  may be desir'd as the Effect of your own Goodness and generous Consideration for my Memory to wear the Diamond Necklace which I know she admires but is far from wishing for it or expecting it altho' the Neck that it was given to adorn and to make more worthy of you should be laid low by the irresistible Leveller  In the bottom Drawer on the Lefthand of the Cabinet you will find Sir all my unfinish'd Scribble  and among the rest a little Parcel indorsed Mr  H  and P  Barlow  The Title will surprise you but as I know not what may happen to make Doubts and Puzzles in the Affair mentioned in those Papers when I cannot obviate them I thought it was best to give a brief History of it in Writing with his Letter to me on the Occasion and I humbly beg the Whole may be kept within your own Breast unless that vile Affair which has much disturb'd me should be reviv'd Altho' I have no Reason to apprehend it will because the poor Girl I hope is sincerely penitent and Mr  H  himself seems in another way of thinking as to her  Will you be pleased Sir to bestow on my dearest Miss  Goodwin  as a Remembrance of her Aunt's true Love the Diamond Solitaire and the second Pair of Earrings Perhaps my dearest Lady  Davers  would not disdain to wear as a Present from her beloved Brother my best Diamond Ring And if my most beloved and most valued Ring of all the dear first Pledge of my Happiness were for the first time since I was honoured with it by your own putting it on taken from my Finger and inamell'd it would be a mournful yet a pleasing Token for my poor Mother and a sweet  Memento  of your Bounty to them and of your inexpressible Goodness and Favour to her poor Daughter But how I presume And yet just now said I had nothing to ask  Now I am unawares to myself upon the Subject of petitioning how it would please me could I know it if the dear Child I have just named were given to the Care and Example of my excellent Miss  Darnford  if she would be pleased to accept of the Trust and if Lady  Davers  has no Objection and would not chuse to take the pretty Soul under her own Wing  I had once great Pleasure in the Hope of having this dear Miss committed to my Care But what Pleasures what Happiness have I not had crouded into this last and this first happy thrice happy Year even more than most of my Sex have had to boast of and those not unhappy neither in a long long Life Every Day has brought with it some new Felicity some new Happiness as unlook'd for as undeserv'd for Oh best Beloved of my Heart how have you always met me in your Comingsin left me at your Goingsout with Smiles and Complacency the  latter  only distinguish'd from the  former  by a kind Regret as the  other  was from  that  by a Joy next to Transport when all  your  dear generous Heart appeared in your noble Countenance and set  my  faithful one into responsive Flutters to meet and receive it with all the grateful Emotions that the chastest conjugal Flame could inspire  But I must not dwell upon these charming charming Reflections My present Doubts will not permit me to indulge them For if I were how would my Desires be rivetted to this EarthWith what Regret should I transfer my Thoughts to a  still  more important and more necessary Subject and with what Ingratitude look up to a diviner and still more noble Master who ought to be the Ultimate of all our Wishes and Desires And who has given me You my dearest Mr  B  and  with  You all that this World can make desirableAnd has therefore a Right to take away what he has given And if I now die what a Glory will it be to me to be permitted to discharge Part of my Obligations to the worthiest of Gentlemen by laying down my Life in the Service of his honourable Family  But let me say one Word for my dear worthy Mrs  Jervis  Her Care and Fidelity will be very  necessary for your Affairs dear Sir while you remain single which I hope will not be long But whenever Sir you make a second Choice be pleased to allow her such an Annuity as may make her independent and pass away the Remainder of her Life with Comfort and Ease And this the rather I presume to request as my late honoured Lady  See  Vol III p  once intimated the same thing to your Generosity If I were to name what that may be it would not be with the Thought of  heightening  but of  limiting  rather the natural Bounty of your Heart and Fifty Pounds a Year would be a rich Provision in her Opinion and will intail upon you dear Sir the Blessings of one of the faithfullest and worthiest Hearts in the Kingdom  Nor will Christian Charity permit me to forget the once wicked but now penitent  Jewkes  I understand by Miss  Darnford  that she begs for nothing but to have the Pleasure of dying in your Service and of having by that means an Opportunity given her of atoning for some small Slips and Mistakes in her Accounts which she had made formerly as she accuses herself for she will have it that Mr  Longman  has been better to her than she deserv'd in passing one  See for a Hint of this  Vol I p    Account particularly to which he had with too much Reason objected Do dear Sir if your  future  happy Lady has no  great  Dislike to the poor Woman be pleased to grant her Request except her own Mind should alter and she desire her Dismission And be pleased to present her with my little Book of select Devotions with my Notes in the Interleaves It is in the bottom Drawer of the Righthand among my devotional Miscellanies Or rather much rather be pleased to order a Copy of  it to be made out for her and to give the Original being mostly my own Handwriting to my dear Father This is a better Thought by much for the dear good Man will esteem it the more for that I wonder I did not think of this before  To the other Servants I have only to leave my Thanks and best Wishes for their respectful Love and dutiful Behaviour to one who from being once hardly the Equal to some of them has been exalted to the honourable Station of their Mistress by your superlative Goodness and Favour No Servants my dear Mr  B  ever deserved a Mistress's Thanks if they do not for they every one of them most chearfully came into all my little Schemes and Regulations and they have incouraged me by their ready Obedience and their respectful Loves to pursue to them the natural Dictates of my own Heart and have made all Assumings and Pride as unnecessary as they would have been grievous to me and censurable by every one else For was it not my high Concern so to behave myself to all Low as well as High that my best beloved Benefactor should not by  my  Arrogance or Inattention have Censurers of  him  added to Enviers of  me  for the Step he had taken so derogatory to his own Honour and to that of his antient and splendid Family  To the Favour of the best of Masters I therefore leave them with this Testimony of their Merits and my kind Regard to them which makes me venture to call them without one Exception from my Silverhair'd  Jonathan  to the lowest Menial  The best Set of Servants  that Gentleman ever had Nor by Miss  Darnford  's Account of the Behaviour of those at the Hall do I find them at all unworthy of being class'd with these here in the happy Character And let me say my dearest Mr  B  that I have been not a little attentive to their respective Behaviours  as well from my own as more particularly from Mrs  Jervis  's Observations because I thought it my Duty as well in Justice to your dear Self as to them  As to  Polly Barlow  to whom I was willing to behave with an Eye to my dear good Lady's Kindness to myself I have nothing to say by way of Distinction from the rest having hinted to Mrs  Jervis  to give her  her  Advice from time to time and that if a good honest Husband should offer she should advise the poor Girl not to decline it  Forgive me dearest Sir for thus mentioning to you in this solemn Letter so particularly your Servants But the Pleasure which their Regularity and Worthiness have given me together with the Knowlege I have of their Fidelity and affectionate Duty to You methinks call for this Testimony of my Satisfaction in them and Recommendation of them to your Favour  And now what have I farther to say but to beg of God to shower down his most precious Blessings upon you my dearest my  first  my  last  and my  only  Love and to return to You an hundredfold the Benefits which you have conferr'd upon Me and Mine and upon so many poor Souls as you have bless'd thro' my Hands And that you may in your next Choice be happy with a Lady who may have every thing I want and who may love and honour you with the same affectionate Duty which has been my Delight and my Glory to pay you For in this I am sure no one  can  exceed me And after having given you long Life Prosperity and Increase of Honour translate you into a blessed Eternity where through the Merits of our common Redeemer I hope I shall be allowed a Place and be permitted O let me indulge that pleasing that  consolatory  Thought to receive and rejoice in my restored  Spouse and principal earthly Good for ever and ever are the Prayers the  last  Prayers if it so please God of my dearest dear Mr  B  Your dutiful and affectionate Wife and faithful Servant  P B  LETTER XXI From Miss  DARNFORD  to Lady  DARNFORD    My honoured Mamma  YOU cannot conceive how you and my dear Papa have delighted the Heart of my good Mrs  B  and obliged her Mr  B  by the Permission you have given me to attend her till the important Hour shall be over with her for the dear Lady is exceedingly apprehensive and one can hardly blame her for I don't believe there is such a happy Couple in the World  I am glad to hear that the Ceremony is over so much to both your Satisfactions May this Matrimony be but a Tenth Part as happy as that I am Witness to and Mr and Mrs  Murray  will have that to boast of which few married People have even among those we call happy  For my Part I believe I shall never care to marry at all for tho' I cannot be so deserving yet I shall not bear to think of an Husband much less excellent than Mr  B  And by what I see in  her  Apprehensions and by what I can conceive of the  Circumstance  I don't think a young Lady can be requited with a  less  worthy one for all she suffers on an Husband's  Account and for the sake of  his  Family and Name  Mrs  Andrews  a discreet worthy Soul as ever I knew and who in her Aspect and Behaviour is far from being a Disgrace even to Mr  B  's Lady is with her dear Daughter to her no small Satisfaction as you may suppose who nowandthen says What a foolish Creature my dear Mother have you for a Daughter  You  did not behave so weakly as I do when you were in the same Circumstances I dare say and yet you had a dear good Husband tho' not a rich one to hope to live forBut come I will have a good Heart to make myself as worthy of the Company and Chearings of Three such Friends as I am bless'd with in my Mother my Miss  Darnford  and Mrs  Jervis  Mr  B  ask'd my Advice Yesterday about having in the House a Midwife to be at hand at a Moment's Warning I told him I fear'd the Sight of such a Person would terrify her And so he instantly started an Expedient which her Mother Mrs  Jervis  and myself approved of and have put into Practice for this Day I have Mrs  Harris  a distant Relation of  mine  tho' not of yours Sir and Madam come to make me a Visit from  Essex  and Mr  B  was so good as to prevail upon her in  Compliment to me  as was pretended to accept of her Board in his House while she stays in Town which she says will be about a Week  Now you must know that this Mrs  Harris  being a discreet modest matronlike Person Mrs  B  took a Liking to her at first Sight and is already very familiar with her and understanding that she is a Gentlewoman who was a Doctor of Physick's Lady and takes as much Delight in administring to the Health of her own Sex as her Husband used to do to that of both Mrs  B  says It is very fortunate  that she has so experienc'd a Lady to consult as she is such a Novice in her own Case  Mr  B  however to carry on the honest Imposture better just now in Presence of Mrs  Harris  and Mrs  Andrews  and me ask'd the former If it was not necessary to have in the House the good Woman This frighted Mrs  B  who turn'd pale and said she could not bear the Thoughts of it Mrs  Harris  said It was highly necessary that Mrs  B  if she would not permit the Gentlewoman to be in the House should see her and that then she apprehended there would be no Necessity as she suppos'd she did not live far off to have her in the House since Mrs  B  was so uneasy upon that Account This pleas'd Mrs  B  much and Mrs  Thomas  was admitted to attend her  Now you must know that this is the Assistant of my new Relation and she being appris'd of the Matter came but never did I see so much Shyness and Apprehension as Mrs  B  shew'd all the time Mrs  Thomas  was with her holding sometimes her Mother sometimes Mrs  Harris  by the Hand and being ready to sweat with Terror  Mrs  Harris  scrap'd Acquaintance with Mrs  Thomas  who pretending to recollect her gave Mrs  Harris  great Praises which increas'd Mrs  B  's Confidence in her And she undertakes to govern the Whole so that the dreaded Mrs  Thomas  need not come till the very Moment which is no small Pleasure to the dear overnice Lady And she seems every Hour to be better pleas'd with Mrs  Harris  who by her prudent Talk will more and more familiarize her to the Circumstance unawares to herself in a manner But notwithstanding this Precaution of a Midwife in the House Mr  B  intends to have a Gentleman of the Profession in Readiness for fear of the worst  I tell Mr  B  he is very happy in this Stratagem but that I suppose he has been more us'd to Contrivances of this sort than he ought and was so free as to add That I presum'd his Lady is hardly the first he has cheated into a Child And indeed I think Mrs  B  's Merit to the rest of her Sex is very great were it only in reforming such an uncommonly agreeable and manly Rake as this for no doubt he has done and would have done a world of Mischief among the Thoughtless and Indiscreet in Upper Life for his Taste when at the worst always lay it seems above the Vulgar  Mrs  B  has written a Letter and the Superscription following will tell you to whom it is directed  "To the ever honour'd and ever dear Mr  B  with Prayers for his Health Honour and Prosperity in this World and everlasting Felicity in that to come  P B  "  It is seal'd with black Wax and she gave it me this Moment on her being taken ill to give to Mr  B  if she dies But GOD of his Mercy avert that and preserve the dear Lady for the Honour of her Sex and the Happiness of all that know her and particularly for that of your  Polly Darnford  for I cannot have a greater Loss I am sure while my honour'd Papa and Mamma are living And may that be for many very many happy Years  I will not close this Letter till all is over Happily as I hope Mrs  B  is better again and has occasionally made some fine Reflections directing herself to me but design'd for the Benefit of her  Polly  on the Subject of the Inconsideration of some of our Sex with regard to this Circumstance inferring that if  such  are  her  Apprehensions tho' a lawful Wife and  such  the Danger attending this Case how must it leave a poor Creature destitute of all  spiritual Consolation as well as of the Assistance and Comfortings of the nearest Friends and of a kind Husband when she has sacrific'd her Honour and cannot think of any thing so probable as the Moment approaches but that God will punish her  in Kind  as she called it that is to say added she by the very Sufferings which are the natural Consequences of the Sin she has so wickedly committed  I knew what her Design was and said Ay  Polly  let you and me and every single young Body bear these Reflections in Mind pronounced by so excellent a Lady in Moments so arduous as these  The Girl wept and very movingly fell down by the Door on her Knees praying to God to preserve her dear Lady and she should be happy for ever  That  as Mrs  B  so often prettily writes  was her Word  Mrs  B  is exceedingly pleas'd with my new Relation Mrs  Harris  as we call her who behaves with so much Prudence that she suspects nothing and told Mrs  Jervis  she wish'd nobody else was to come near her And as she goes out being a Person of Eminence in her way two or three times a Day and last Night staid out late Mrs  B  said she hop'd she would not be out when she should wish her to be at home  I have the Pleasure the very great Pleasure my dear Papa and Mamma to acquaint you and I know you will rejoice with me upon it that just half an Hour ago my dear Mrs  B  was brought tobed of a fine Boy  We are all out of our Wits for Joy almost I ran down to Mr  B  myself who receiv'd me with trembling Impatience A Boy a fine Boy dear Mr  B  said I A Son and Heir indeed  But how does my  Pamela  Is  she  safe Is  she  like to do well We hope so said I Or I had not come down to you I'll assure you He folded me in his Arms in a joyful Rapture How happy you make me dearest Miss  Darnford  If my  Pamela  is safe the Boy is welcome welcome indeedBut when may I go up to thank my Jewel  Mrs  Andrews  is so overjoy'd and so thankful that there's no getting her from her Knees  A Man and Horse is dispatch'd already to Lady  Davers  and another order'd to  Kent  to the good old Man  Mrs  Jervis  when I went up said she must go down and release the good Folks from their Knees for half an Hour before they declar'd they would not stir from that Posture till they heard how it went with their Lady and when the happy News was brought them of her Safety and a young Master they were quite ecstatick she says in their Joy and not a dry Eye among them shaking Hands and congratulating one another Men and Maids Which must make it one of the most affecting Sights that can be imagin'd And Mr  Longman  who had no Power to leave the House for three Days past tho' Business requir'd his Presence in  Bedfordshire  sought his worthy Principal and never was so much moving Joy seen as this honesthearted Steward ran over with  I have not Mrs  B  's Pen so cannot draw these affecting Scenes of Joy as she could have done had she been in my CaseLet me only say I never saw such a FamilyJoy in my Life And who would care for Royalty and all its Pageantry when Virtue can thus interest every body in its Concerns and on such an Occasion as this give that general and sincere Joy to all within its Circle that could fill a  Nation on the Birth of a firstborn Prince from Sovereigns the most beloved  I did a foolish thing in my JoyI gave Mr  B  the Letter design'd for him had an unhappy Event follow'd and he won't give it me again but says he will obtain Mrs  B  's Leave when she is better to open it and the happier Turn will augment his Thankfulness to God and Love to her when he shall by this means be blest with Sentiments so different from what the other Case would have afforded But I will get it from him if I can and give it her back for one knows not what it may contain yet her Innocence and Purity make one less apprehensive a good deal for I dare say she has no Excuses to make for Failings he knows nothing of  Mrs  B  had a very sharp Time Never more my dear Papa talk of a Husband to me Indeed in the Mind I am in I will never be marry'd Place all your Expectations on  Nancy  Not one of these Men that I have yet seen Mr  B  excepted and you know what a Chance it was that he would be so good is worth running these Risques for But his Indearments and Tenderness to his Lady his thankful and manly Gratitude and Politeness when he was admitted to pay his Respects to her and his Behaviour to Mrs  Andrews  and to us all tho' but for a Visit of ten Minutes was alone worthy of all her Risque  I would give you a Description of it had I Mrs  B  's Pen and of twenty agreeable Scenes and Conversations besides But for want of that must conclude with my humble Duty as becomes honour'd Sir and Madam  Your ever grateful  POLLY DARNFORD  You may guess at our Hurry for I have been Three Days writing this Letter Piece by Piece  LETTER XXII From the same  My honoured Papa and Mamma  WE have nothing but Joy and Festivity in this House and it would be endless to tell you the Congratulations the happy Family receives every Day from Tenants and Friends Mr  B  you know was always deem'd one of the kindest Landlords in  England  and his Tenants are so overjoy'd at the happy Event which has given them a young Landlord of his Name for all those who live in that large Part of the Estate which came by Lady  B  his Mother were much afraid of having any of Sir  Jacob Swynford  's Family for their Landlord who they say are all made up of Pride and Cruelty and would have racked them to Death that they had a voluntary Meeting of about Twenty of the principal of them to rejoice on the Occasion and it was unanimously agreed to make a Present of a Piece of gilt Plate to serve as a Bason for the Christening to the Value of One hundred Guineas on which is to be ingraven the following Inscription  In Acknowlegement of the Humanity and Generosity of the Best of Landlords and as a Token of his Tenants Joy on the happy Birth of a Son and Heir who will it is hoped inherit his Father's Generosity and his Mother's Virtues this Piece of Plate is with all due Gratitude presented as a Christening Bason to all the Children that shall proceed from such worthy Parents  and their Descendants to the End of Time  By the obliged and joyful Tenants of the maternal Estate in  Bedfordshire  and  Gloucestershire  the Initials of whose Names are underingraven  viz    Then are to follow the first Letters of each Persons Christian and Surname  What an Honour is this to a Landlord In my Opinion far very far surpassing the  misnomer'd  Freegifts that we read of in some Kingdoms on extraordinary Occasions some of them like this For here it is all truly spontaneousA Free Gift  indeed  and Mr  B  took it very kindly and has put off the Christening for a Week to give Time for its being completed and inscribed as above  Such good Tenants such a good Wife such Blessings from Heaven following him nobody I tell Mr  B  has so much Incouragement to be good as he has and if hereafter he should swerve he would not have the least Excuse and would be the ungratefullest Man breathing  The Earl and Countess of  C  and Lord and Lady  Davers  are here to stand in Person at the Christening and you cannot conceive how greatly my Lady  Davers  is transported with Joy to have a Son and Heir to the Estate She is every Hour almost thanking her dear Sister for him and reads in the Child all the great Qualities she forms to herself in him 'Tis indeed a charming Boy and has a great deal if one may judge of a Child so very young of his Father's manly Aspect The dear Lady herself is still but weak but the Joy of all around her and her Spouse's Tenderness and Politeness give her chearful and free Spirits and she is all Serenity Ease and Thankfulness  Mrs  B  as soon as the Danger was over asked me for her Letter with the black Seal I had been very earnest to get it from Mr  B  but to no Purpose So I was forced to tell her who had it She said but very composedly she was sorry for it and hop'd he had not open'd it  He came into her Chamber soon after and I demanded it before her He said he had designed to ask her Leave to break the Seal which he had not yet done nor would without her Consent  You will see nothing in it Sir said the dear Lady but a grateful Heart a faithful Love and my Prayers that God will be as good to You as you have been to Me  Will you give me Leave my Dear said he to break the Seal If you do Sir let it not be in my Presence but it is too serious Not my Dear now the Apprehension is so happily over It may now add to my Joy and my Thankfulness on that Account Then do as you please Sir But I had rather you would not  Then here it is Miss  Darnford  I had it from you It was put into your Hands and there I place it again That's something like said I considering the Gentleman Mrs  B  I hope we shall bring him into good Order between us in time  So I return'd it to the dear Writer who lifted up her Eyes and her Lips moving shew'd a thankful Ejaculation that she was spared to receive it back again and put it into her Bosom  I related to Lady  Davers  when she came this Circumstance and she I believe has got Leave to take it with her She is very proud of all Opportunities now of justifying her Brother's Choice and doing Honour to his Spouse with Lady  Betty C  who is her great Favourite and who delights to read Mrs  B  's Letters  You desire to know my honoured Papa how Mr  B  passes his Time and whether it be in his Lady's Chamber No indeed Catch Gentlemen the best of them in too great a Complaisance that way if you can What then does he pass his Time with me you are pleased to ask What a Disadvantage a Man lies under who has been once a Rake But I am so generally with Mrs  B  that when I tell you Sir that his Visits to her are pretty much polite Form I believe I answer all you mean by your Questions and especially when I remind you Sir thai Lady and Lord  Davers  and the Earl and Countess and your unworthy Daughter are at Dinner and Suppertime always together for Mrs  Andrews  who is not yet gone back to  Kent  breakfasts dines and sups with her beloved Daughter and is hardly ever out of her Room  Then Sir Mr  B  and the Earl and Lord  Davers  give pretty constant Application to the Business of Parliament and nowandthen sup abroad So Sir we are all upon Honour and I could wish only that your Pleasantry always gives me Joy as it is a Token that you have your muchdesired Health and Freedom of Spirits that even in Jest my  Mamma  's Daughter might pass unquestioned  But I know why you do it It is only to put me out of Heart to ask to stay longer Yet I wish But I know you won't permit me to go thro' the whole Winter hereWill my dear Papa grant it do you think my honoured Mamma if you were to lay the highest Obligation upon your dutiful Daughter and petition for me And should you care to try  I dare not hope it myself you see Madam But when one sees a Gentleman here who denies his Lady nothing that she asks it makes one be ready  to wish methinks that Lady  Darnford  was as happy in that Particular as Lady  B    Your  Indulgence for this Winter this  one  Winter or rather this small  Remainder  of Winter I make not so much doubt of you see Madam I know you'll call me a bold Girl but then you always when you do condescend to grant my Request And I will be as good as ever I can afterwards I will fetch up all the lost Time rise an Hour sooner in the Morning go tobed an Hour sooner at Night flower my Papa any thing he pleases read him to sleep when he pleases put his Gout into good Humour when it will be soothedAnd Mrs  B  will to crown all come down with me by Permission of her sovereign Lord who will attend her you may be sure and will not  all  this do to procure me a Month or two moreIf it won't why then I will thank you for your past Indulgence and with all Duty and Chearfulness bid Adieu to this dear  London  this dearer Family and attend a  still  dearer Papa and Mamma whose dutiful Daughter I will ever be whilst  POLLY DARNFORD  LETTER XXIII To the same  My honoured Papa and Mamma  I Have received your joint Commands and int  nd to set out on  Wednesday  next Week I hope I shall find my Papa in better Health than he is at present and in better Humour too for I am very sorry he is displeased with my petitioning for a little longer Time in  London  It is very severe to impute  to me Want of Duty and Affection to you both which would if deserved make me very unworthy of your Indulgence  Mr  B  and his dear Lady are resolved to accompany me in their Coach and Six till your Chariot meets me if you will be pleased to permit it so to do and even set me down at your Gate if it do not but he vows that he will not alight at your House nor let his Lady neither But I say that this is a misplaced Resentment because I ought to think it a Favour that you have indulg'd me so much as you have And yet even this is likewise a Favour on  their  Side to me because it is an Instance of their Fondness for your unworthy Daughter's Company  Mrs  B  is if possible more lovely since her Lyingin than before She has so much Delight in her Nursery that I fear it will take her off from her Pen which will be a great Loss to all whom she used to oblige with her Correspondence Indeed this new Object of her Care is a charming Child and she is exceedingly pleased with her Nursefor she is not permitted as she very much desired to perform that Office herself  She makes a great Proficiency in the  French  and  Italian  Languages and well she may for she has the best Schoolmaster in the World and one whom she loves better than Lady ever loved a Tutor He is lofty and won't be disputed with but I never saw a more polite and tender Husband for all that and well may a Lady bless'd as she is bear with a little Imperiousness sometimes which however she nips in the Bud by her Sweetness of Temper and ready Compliance But then he is a Man of Sense and a Lady need be the less concern'd to yield a Point to a Man of Sense and of Generosity as he is Who is incapable of treating her the worse  for her Resignation and Complacency Whenever I marry it shall be to a Man of Sense and a generous Man against the World for such an one cannot treat a Woman ill as Mrs  B  often observes  We had a splendid Christening and exceedingly well order'd and every body was highly delighted at it The Quality Gossips went away but on  Tuesday  and my Lady  Davers  took Leave of her charming Sister with all the Blessings and all the Kindness and affectionate Fondness to her that could be express'd  Mr  Andrews  that worthy old Man came up to see his Grandson Yesterday and in order to attend his Wife down You would never have forgotten the good Man's Behaviour had you seen it to his Daughter and to the charming Child I wish I could describe it to you but I am apt to think Mrs  B  will take notice of it to Lady  Davers  and if she enters into the Description of it while I stay I will beg a Copy of it to bring down with me because I know you were pleas'd with the sensible plain good Man and his Ways when at the Hall in your Neighbourhood  The Child is named  William  that I should have told you but I write without any manner of Connection just as things come uppermost But don't my dear Papa construe this too as an Instance of Disrespect I wish you was not so angry with me it makes me almost afraid to see youAs I said I shall set out next  Wednesday  in Mr  B  's Coach and Six and as we shall keep the main Road all the Way I shall see by my being met how I am to be received or whether pardon'd or not Mr  B  says he will take me back again if my dear Papa frown at me ever so little and he will not deliver me up into any other Hands but his neither  We have been at several Plays and at the Opera divers times for we make the best of our Time as it is so short and we fear'd how it would be tho' I hoped I should not have Anger neither Mrs  B  is taken up with writing between whiles Remarks upon the Plays  c  she sees in a little Book for Lady  Davers  She sent that Lady her Remarks upon one or two with which she is so well pleased that she will not let even her Nursery pass for an Excuse from writing on upon those Subjects and this will so ingross the dear Lady's Pen that I shall not be favour'd so much as I used to be but Lady  Davers  promises me to lend me the Book when she has read it so that will be some Satisfaction  I see but one thing that can possibly happen to disturb the Felicity of this charming Couple and that I will mention in Confidence Mr  B  and Mrs  B  and myself were at the Masquerade before she layin There was a Lady greatly taken with Mr  B  She was in a Nun's Habit and followed him whereever he went and Mr  Turner  a Gentleman of one of the Inns of Court who visits Mr  B  sometimes and is an old Acquaintance of his tells me by the Bye that the Lady took an Opportunity to unmask to Mr  B  Mr  Turner  has since found she is the young Countess Dowager of a fine Lady but not the most prudent in her Conduct of late since her Widowhood And he has since discovered as he says that a Letter or two has passed between Mr  B  and that Lady if not more  Now Mrs  B  with all her Perfections has as she owns a little Spice of Jealousy and should she be once alarm'd I tremble for the Consequences to both their Happiness  It is my Opinion that if ever any thing makes a Misunderstanding between them it will be from some such Quarter as this But 'tis a thousand pities it should And I hope as to the actual Correspondence begun Mr  Turner  is mistaken  But be it as it will I would not for the World the first Hints of this Matter should come from me Mr  B  is a very enterprising and gallant Gentleman is a fine Figure of a Man and very genteel and I don't wonder a Lady may like him But be seems so pleas'd so satisfy'd with his Lady and carries it to her with so much Tenderness and Affection that I hope her Merit and this his Affection for her will secure his conjugal Fidelity  If it prove otherwise and she discovers it I know no one that would be more miserable than Mrs  B  as well from Motives of Piety and Virtue as from the excessive Love she bears himBut I hope for better Things for both their sakes  My humble Thanks for all your Indulgences to me with Hopes that you will not my dear Papa and Mamma hold your Displeasure against me when I throw myself at your Feet as I now soon hope to do conclude me  Your dutiful Daughter  M DARNFORD  LETTER XXIV From Mrs  B  to Lady  DAVERS    My dear Lady  WE are just return'd from accompanying the worthy Miss  Darnford  as far as  Bedford  in her Way home where her Papa and Mamma met  her in a Coach and Four Sir  Simon  put on his pleasant Airs and schooled Mr  B  for persuading his Daughter to stay so long from him  me  for putting her upon asking to stay longer and  Miss  for being persuaded by us  I think he is worse than ever in his way of Talk and for my Rebukes to him for he ran on a deal of Stuff about me and my late Circumstance and would have it that I am so much improv'd that I ought to make a Court'sy to Mr  B  once an Hour He said when I was angry at him and his Lady blam'd him that it was all pure Revenge for my Letter  See  Vol III  p    and for keeping Miss so long from him  We tarry'd two Days together at  Bedford  for we knew not how to part and then we took a most affectionate Leave of each other  We struck out of the Road a little to make a Visit to the dear House where we tarry'd one Night and next Morning before any body could come to congratulate us designing to be  incog  we proceeded on our Journey to  London  and found my dearest dear Boy in charming Health  What a new Pleasure has God Almighty's Goodness bestow'd upon me which after every little Absence rises upon me in a true maternal Tenderness every Step I move toward the dear little Blessing Yet sometimes I think your dear Brother is not so fond of him as I wish him to be He says 'tis time enough for him to mind him when he can return his Notice and be grateful A negligent Word i'n't it Madam Considering  My dear Father came to Town to accompany my good Mother down to  Kent  and they set out three or four Days after your Ladyship left us It is impossible to describe the Joy with which his  worthy Heart overflow'd when he congratulated us on the happy Event And as he had been apprehensive for his Daughter's Safety judge my Lady what his Transports must be to see us all safe and well and happy and a Son given to dear Mr  B  by his greatly honoured Daughter  I was in the Nursery when he came So was my Mother Miss  Darnford  also was there And Mr  B  who was in his Closet at his Arrival after having received his most respectful Congratulations himself brought him up tho' he has not been there since indeed he han't  Pamela  said the dear Gentleman see who's here  I sprung to him and kneeled for his kind Blessing O my Father said I see pointing to the dear Baby at the Nurse's Breast how God Almighty has answer'd all our Prayers  He dropp'd down on his reverend Knees by me clasping me in his indulgent Arms O my DaughterO my blessed DaughterAnd do I once more see you And see you safe and wellI do I doBlessed be thy Name O gracious GOD for these thy Mercies  While we were thus joined happy Father and happy Daughter in one Thanksgiving Prayer the sweet Baby having fallen asleep the Nurse had put it into the Cradle and when my Father rose from me he went to my Mother God bless my dear  Betty  said he I long'd to see you after this Separation Here's Joy Here's Pleasure O how happy are we And taking her Hand he kneeled down on one Side the Cradle and my Mother on the other both looking at the dear Baby with Eyes running over and Hand in Hand he prayed in the most fervent manner for a Blessing upon the dear Infant and that God Almighty would make him an Honour to his Father's Family and to his Mother's Virtue  that was his kind Word and that in the Words of Scripture  he might grow on and be in Favour both with the Lord and with Men    They both rose and Mr  B  taking my Hand and Miss  Darnford  's your Ladyship may guess how  we  were moved for Miss is a sweetnatur'd Lady you know Madam My dear  Pamela  How these kind these grateful Hearts affect me Do you often my dear Miss  Darnford  see Scenes wrought up by the Poets to this moving Height Here we behold and admire that noble Simplicity in which Nature always triumphs over her Handmaid Art And which makes a Scene of Joy as affecting to a noble Mind as that of the deepest Distress Else how could it display its Force thus sweetly on your lovely Cheek And he saluted the dear Miss and me too  Mr  B  has just put into my Hands Mr  Lockes  's Treatise on Education and he commands me to give him my Thoughts upon it in Writing He has a very high Regard for this Author and tells me That my Tenderness for  Billy  will make me think some of the first Advice given in it a little harsh perhaps but altho' he has not read it through only having dipp'd into it here and there he believes from the Name of the Author I cannot have a better Directory And my Opinion of it after I have well considered it will inform him he says of my own Capacity and Prudence and how far he may rely upon both in the Point of a  first Education    I ask'd If I might not be excus'd Writing only making my Observations here and there to himself as I found Occasion But he says I shall myself better consider it and be more a Mistress of the Subject and he shall the better attend to my Reasonings when they are put into Writing And surely my Dear said he you may in such an important Point as this as well oblige  me  with a little of your Penmanship as our other dear Friends  After this your Ladyship will judge I had not another Word to say He cuts one to the Heart when he speaks so seriously  I have look'd a little into it It is a Book quite accommodated to my Case being written to a GentleGentleman the Author's Friend for the Regulation of his Conduct towards his Children But how shall I do Madam if in such a fam'd and renowned Author I see already some few things that I think want clearing up Won't it look like intolerable Vanity in such a one as me to find fault with such a Genius as Mr  Locke  's  But I will consider of the Matter thoroughly before I set Pen to Paper for altho' he writes in a very familiar and intelligible Style perhaps I may not understand him at once reading  But I must on this Occasion give your Ladyship the Particulars of a short Conversation between your dear Brother and me which however perhaps will not be to my Advantage because it will shew you what a teizing Body I can be if I am indulged But Mr  B  will not spoil me neither in that way No fear of that I dare say Your Ladyship will see this in the very Dialogue I shall give you  Thus it was I had been reading in Mr  Locke  's Book and Mr  B  asked me How I lik'd it Exceedingly well Sir But I have a Proposal to make which if you will be pleased to comply with will give me a charming Opportunity of understanding Mr  Locke    What is your Proposal my Dear I see it is some very particular one by that sweet Earnestness in your Look  Why so it is reply'd I And I must know whether you are in a high good Humour with me before I make it I think you look grave upon me and my Proposal will not then do I'm sure  You have all the amusing Ways of your Sex my dear  Pamela  But tell me what you would say You know I don't love Suspense  May be you're busy Sir Perhaps I break in upon you I believe you were going into your Closet  True Woman said he how you love to put one upon the Tenters Yet my Life for yours by your Parade what I just now thought important is some pretty Trifle Speak it at once or I'll be angry with you and tapp'd my Cheek  Well I wish I had not come just nowI see you are not in a quite good Humour enough for my Proposal So pray Sir excuse me till Tomorrow  He took my Hand and led me to his Closet calling me his pretty Impertinent and then urging me I said You know Sir I have not been us'd to the Company of Children Your dear  Billy  will not make me fit for a long time to judge of any Part of Education I can learn of the charming Boy nothing but the Baby Conduct But now if you would permit me to take into the House some little Master of three or four Years old or Miss of five or six I should watch over all their little Ways and now reading a Chapter in the  Child  and now a Chapter in  the Book  I shall be inabled to look forward and with Advantage into the Subject and to go thro' all the Parts of Education tolerably for one of my Capacity for Sir I can by my own Defects and what I have wished to mend know how to judge of and supply that Part of Life which carries one up to Eleven or Twelve Years of Age which was mine when my Lady took me  A pretty Thought  Pamela  But tell me Who will part with their Child think you Would  you  do it if it were your own Case altho' you were ever so  well assur'd of the Advantages your Littleone would reap by it For don't you consider my Dear that the Child ought to be wholly subjected to your Authority That its Father or Mother ought seldom to see it because it should think itself absolutely dependent upon you And where my Dear will you meet with Parents so resign'd Besides one would have the Child descended of genteel Parents and not such as could do nothing for it otherwise the Turn of Mind and Education you would give it might do it more Harm than Good  All this is true Sir very true But would you have no other Objection if one could find a genteelly descended young Master And would you join to persuade his Papa to give me up this Power only from three Months to three Months as I liked and the Child liked and as the Papa approved of my Proceedings  This is so reasonable with these last Conditions  Pamela  that I should be pleased with your Notion if it could be put in Practice because the Child would be benefited by your Instruction and you would be improved in an Art that I could wish to see you an Adept in  But perhaps Sir you had rather it were a Miss than a Master  I had my Dear if a Miss could be found whose Parents would give her up to you But I suppose you have some Master in your Head by your puting it upon that Sex at first  Let me see Sir You say you are in a good Humour Let me see if you be Looking boldly in his Face  He saluted me What now would the pretty Fool be at  Only Sir that you have nothing to do but to speak the Word and there is a Miss whose Papa and  Mamma too I am sure would consent to give up to me for my own Instruction as well as for her sake and if to speak in the Scripture Phrase I have found  Grace in your Sight  kind Sir speak this Word to the dear Miss's Papa  And have you thus come over with me  Pamela  Go I am half angry with you for leading me on in this manner against myself This looks so artful that I won't love you Dear Sir And dear Madam too Begone I say You have surpris'd me by Art when your Talent is Nature and you should keep to that  I was sadly balk'd and vex'd and had neither Power to go nor stay At last seeing I had put him into a kind of Flutter as now he had put me I moved my unwilling Feet towards the Door He took a Turn about the Closet mean time Yet stay said he there is something so generous in your Art that on Recollection I cannot part with you  He took Notice of the starting Tear I am to blame You had surpris'd me so that my hasty Temper got the better of my Consideration Let me kiss away this pearly Fugitive Forgive me my dearest Love What Brutes are such passionate Wretches as me when compar'd to such Angels as my  Pamela  I see at once now all the Force and all the Merit of your amiable Generosity And to make you amends for this my Hastiness and inconsiderate Harshness I will cooly consider of this Matter and will either satisfy you by my Compliance or by the Reasons I will give for the contrary  But say my  Pamela  can you forgive my Hastiness Can I Sir Yes indeed clasping my Arms about him and bid me Go and Begone twenty times a Day if I am to be thus kindly called back to you thus nobly and condescendingly treated in the same Breath almost I see dear Sir continued  I that I must be in Fault if ever you are lastingly displeased with me For as soon as you turn yourself about your Anger vanishes and you make me rich Amends for speaking a few harsh Words Only one thing dear Sir let me add If I have dealt artfully with you impute it to my Fear of offending you thro' the Nature of my Petition and not thro' Design And that I took the Example of the Prophet to King  David  in the Parable of the  EweLamb    I remember it my Dear and you have well pointed your Parable and had nothing to do but to say  Thou art the Man  I am called upon by my dear Benefactor for a little Airing and he suffers me only to conclude this long Letter knowing to whom I have the Honour to write this being Postday And so I am obliged with greater Abruptness than I had design'd to mention thankfully your Ladyship's Goodness to me particularly in that kind kind Letter  See Letter  XIX  in this Volume  which your dear Brother shew'd me  this Morning  and not before I believe for fear I should be so much oppress'd by the Sense of your Ladyship's unmerited Goodness to me had he shew'd it me before your Departure from us that I should not be able to look up to you heaping Favours and Blessings upon me as you hourly were besides What a happy happy Creature am I But my Gratitude runs me into Length and sorry I am that I cannot have time just now to indulge it  But yet I am apt sometimes to doubt whether I ought to think myself so very happy and whether it is not an Argument of a mean Spirit because I am under Obligations  unreturnable  Obligations to every living Soul as well as to your Ladyship and  yet can rejoice in them as if it was such a glorious Thing to be obliged when it is not in one's Power to oblige again  Is there nothing my dear Lord and Lady  Davers  is there nothing my dear Countess and my good Lord  C  that I can do to shew at least that I have a  Will  and am not an ingrateful and a sordid Creature  And yet if you give me Power to do any thing that will have the Appearance of a Return even that  Power  will be laying a fresh Obligation upon meWhich however I should be very proud of because I should thereby convince you by something more than Words how much I am most particularly to yourself my dearest Lady  Davers  my Sister my Friend my Patroness  Your most obliged and faithful Servant  P B  Your dear Brother joins in respectful Thankfulfulness to his Four noble Gossips And I made my  Billy  by his Lips subscribe his I hope so to direct his earliest Notions as to make him sensible of his dutiful Obligations to such noble and good Godpapa's and Mamma's  LETTER XXV From Lady  DAVERS  to Mrs  B  My dearest  Pamela  TALK not to us of unreturnable Obligations and all that as by your last Letter You do more for us in the Entertainment you give us all by your Letters than we  have  done or ever  can  for  you And as to me I know no greater Pleasure in the World than my Brother's Felicity and yours God continue it to you both I am sure it will be  his  Fault and not yours if it be at all diminish'd  We have heard some idle Rumours here as if you were a little uneasy of late and having not had a Letter from you for this Fortnight past it makes me write to ask How you all do and whether you expected an Answer from me to your last  I hope you wont be punctilious with me my  Pamela  For we have nothing to write to you about except it be how much we all love and honour you and that you believe already or else you don't do us Justice  I suppose you'll be going out of Town soon now the Parliament is rising My Lord is resolv'd to put his Proxy into another Hand and intends I believe to take my Brother's Advice in it Both the Earl and his Lordship are highly pleas'd with my Brother's moderate and independent Principles He has got great Credit among all unprejudic'd Men by the Part he acted throughout the last Sessions in which he has shewn that he would no more join to distress and clog the Wheels of Government by an unreasonable Opposition than he would do the dirty Work of any Administration As he has so noble a Fortune and wants nothing of any Body he would be doubly to blame to take any other Part than that of his Country in which he has so great a Stake  May he act  out  of the House and  in  the House with equal Honour and he will be his Country's Pride and your Pride and mine too Which is the Wish of  Your affectionate Sister  B DAVERS  If you want a Pretence to kiss my dear Boy give him nowandthen one for me I hope he improves under the Eye of so careful a Mamma the little Rogue will else be unworthier than I wish him to be I hope you proceed with my Book I must see your Observations on  Locke  too 'Twas a charming pretty Thought of yours that of Miss  Goodwin  A hasty Wretch how could he be angry 'Twas well he so soon consider'd of the Matter and ask'd Pardon  LETTER XXVI  My dearest Lady  I Have been a little in Disorder that I have Some little Rubs have happen'd I hope they will be happily removed But I am unwilling to believe all that is said This is a wicked Town though I wish we were out of it But I see not when that will be I wish Mr  B  would let me and my  Billy  go into  Kent  But I don't care to leave him behind me neither and he is not inclin'd to go Excuse my Brevity my dearest Lady But I must break off with only assuring your Ladyship that I am and ever will be  Your obliged and grateful  P B  LETTER XXVII  My dearest  Pamela  I Understand Things go not so well as I wish If you think my coming up to Town and resideing with you while you stay in it will be of Service  to you or help to get you out of it I will set out directly I will pretend some Indisposition and a Desire of consulting your  London  Physicians or any thing you shall think fit to be done by  Your affectionate Sister and faithful Friend  B DAVERS  LETTER XXVIII  My dearest Lady  A Thousand Thanks for your Goodness to me But I hope all will be well I hope God will inable me to act so prudent a Part as will touch his generous Breast Be pleased to tell me what your Ladyship has heard but it becomes not me I think till I cannot help it to make any Appeals for I know those will not be excus'd and I do all I can to suppress my Uneasiness before him But I pay for it when I am alone My Nursery and my Reliance on God I should have said the latter first are all my Consolation God preserve and bless you my good Lady and my Noble Lord But I am apt to think your Ladyship's Presence will not avail prays  Your affectionate and obliged  P B  LETTER XXIX  WHY does not my sweet Girl subscribe  Sister  as usual I have done nothing amiss to you I love you dearly and ever will I can't help my  Brother's Faults But I hope he uses you with Politeness and Decency He shall be none of my Brother if he don't I rest a great deal upon your Prudence and it will be very meritorious if you can overcome yourself so as to act unexceptionably tho' it may not be deserv'd on this Occasion For in doing so you'll have a Triumph over Nature itself for my dear Girl as you have formerly own'd you have a little Touch  See  p  of this  Volume  of Jealousy in your Composition  What I have heard is no Secret to any body The injured Party is generally the last that hears in these Cases and you shall not first be told any thing by me that must  afflict  you but cannot  you  more than it does  me  God give you Patience and Comfort The wicked Lady has a deal to answer for to disturb such an uncommon Happiness But no more than that I am  Your ever affectionate Sister  B DAVERS  I am all Impatience to hear how you conduct yourself on this trying Occasion Let me know  what  you have heard and  how  you came to hear it  LETTER XXX  WHY don't I subscribe Sister asks my dearest Lady  Davers  I have not had the Courage to do it of late For my Title to that Honour arises from the dear thrice dear Mr  B  And how long I may be permitted to call him mine I cannot say But since you command it I will call your  Ladyship by that beloved Name let the rest happen as God shall see fit  Mr  B  cannot be unpolite but he is cold and a little cross and short in his Speeches to me I try to hide my Grief from every body and from him most for my dear Lady neither my Father Mother nor Miss  Darnford  know any thing from me Mrs  Jervis  from whom I seldom hide any thing as she is on the Spot with me hears not my Complainings nor my Uneasiness for I would not lessen the dear Gentleman He may  yet  see the Error of the Way he is in God grant it for his own sake as well as mine I am even sorry your Ladyship is afflicted with the Knowlege of the Matter  The poor unhappy Lady God forgive her is to be pity'd She loves him and having strong Passions and being unus'd to be controul'd is lost to a Sense of Honour and Justice poor poor Lady O these wicked Masquerades From them springs all my Unhappiness My  Spaniard  was too amiable and met with a Lady who was no Nun but in Habit Every one was taken with him in that Habit so suited to the natural Dignity of his Person O these wicked wicked Masquerades  I am all Patience in Appearance all Uneasiness in Reality I did not think I could especially in  this  Point this most  affecting  Point be such an Hypocrite It has cost meYour Ladyship knows not what it has cost me to be able to assume that Character Yet my Eyes are swell'd with crying and look red altho' I am always breatheing on my Hand and patting them with that and my warm Breath to hide the Distress that will from my overcharged Heart appear in them  Then he says What's the matter with the little Fool You're always in this Way What ails you  Pamela  Only a little vapourish Sir Nasty Vapours Don't be angry at meThen  Billy  I thought was not very well  This Boy will spoil your Temper At this Rate what should be your Joy will become your Misfortune Don't receive me in this Manner I charge you  In what Manner Sir I always receive you with a grateful Heart If any thing troubles me it is in your Absence But see Sir then I try to smile and seem pleas'd I am all Sunshine now you are come Don't you see I am  Yes your Sunshine of late is all thro' a Cloud I know not what's the matter with you Your Temper will alter and then  It shan't alter Sir It shan't if I can help it And then I kiss'd his Hand that dear Hand that perhaps was last about his more beloved Countess's Neck Distracting Reflection  But come maybe I think the worst To be sure I doFor my Apprehensions were ever aforehand with Events and bad must be the Case if it is worse than I think it But it will ripen of itself it is a corroding Evil It will increase to its Crisis and then it may dissipate happily or end in Death  All that grieves me for I have had the Happiness of a whole Life crouded thick upon me into a few past Months and so ought to be grateful for the Good I have reaped is for his own dear sake for his Soul's sake But come he is a young Gentleman and may see his Error This may be a Trial to  him  as well as to  me  And if he  should  conquer it what a charming charming Thing Would that be  You command me to let you know  what  I have heard and how I  came  to hear it I told your  Ladyship in one of my former  See this  Vol  p      that two Gentlemen brought up to the Law but above the Practice of it tho' I doubt not above Practices less honourable had visited us on coming to Town  They have been often here since Mr  Turner  particularly and sometimes by himself when Mr  B  has happen'd to be out and he it was as I guess'd that gave me at the wicked Masquerade the Caution of looking after my  Musidorus  Ibid  p      I did not like their Visits and  his  much less For he seem'd to me a Man of an intriguing Spirit But about Three Weeks ago Mr  B  setting out upon a Party of Pleasure to  Oxford  he came and pretending great Business with me and I happening to be at Breakfast in the Parlour only  Polly  attending me admitted him to drink a Dish of Chocolate with me And when  Polly  had stept down he told me after many Apologies that he had discover'd who the Nun was at the Masquerade that had ingag'd Mr  B  I said It was very indifferent to me who the Lady was  He reply'd making still more Apologies and pretending great Reluctance to speak out That it was no less a Lady than the young Countess Dowager of a Lady noted for her Wit and her Beauty but of a gay Character tho' he believ'd not yet culpable  I was alarm'd but would not let him see it and he run into the Topick of the Injustice of marry'd Gentlemen who had virtuous Wives and gave themselves up to Intrigues of this kind  I remember'd some of Mr  B  's Lessons formerly of which I once gave your Ladyship a Transcript  See  Vol II  p    particularly that of drawing a kind Veil over his  Faults and extenuating those I could not Hide and still more particularly that Caution that if ever Rakes attempted a marry'd Lady their Incouragement proceeded from the Slights and Contempts with which they endeavour'd to inspire her against her Husband and I told Mr  Turner  That I was so well satisfy'd in Mr  B  's Affection for me and his wellknown Honour that I could not think myself obliged to any Gentleman who should endeavour to give me a less Opinion of either than I ought to have  He then bluntly told me that the very Party Mr  B  was upon was with the Countess for one and the Lord who had marry'd her Sister  I said I was glad he was in such good Company and wished him all manner of Pleasure in it  He hoped he said he might trust to my Discretion that I would not let Mr  B  know from whom I had the Information That indeed his Motive was Selfinterest in mentioning it to me for that he had presum'd to make some Overtures of an honourable Nature to the Countess in his own Behalf which had been rejected since that Masquerade Night And that he hoped the prudent Use I would make of the Intimation might somehow be a Means to break off that Correspondence before it was attended with bad Consequences  I told him coldly tho' it stung me to the Heart That I should not interfere in the Matter at all That I was fully assur'd of Mr  B  's Honour and was sorry he Mr  Turner  had so bad an Opinion of a Lady for whom he professed so high a Consideration And rising up Will you excuse me Sir that I cannot attend at all to such a Subject as this and think I ought not and so must withdraw  Only Madam one Word He offer'd to take my Hand but I would not permit it And then he  swore a great Oath that he had told me his true and his only Motive And that Letters had passed between the Countess and Mr  B  adding That one Day I would blame myself for not endeavouring to stifle a Flame that might now perhaps be kept under but which if it got Head would be of more fatal Consequence to my Repose than I at present imagin'd But said he I beg you'll keep it in your own Breast else it may from two such hasty Spirits as his and mine possibly be attended with still worse Consequences  I will never Sir enter into a Subject that is not proper to be communicated every Tittle of it to Mr  B  and this must be my Excuse for withdrawing And away I went from him  Your Ladyship will judge with how uneasy an Heart which became more so when I sat down to reflect upon what he had told me But I was resolved to give it as little Credit as I could or that any thing would come of it till Mr  B  's own Behaviour should convince me to my Affliction that I had some Reason to be alarm'd So I open'd not my Lips about it to Mrs  Jervis  or any body  At Mr  B  's Return I receiv'd him in my usual affectionate and unreserved Manner and he behav'd himself with as great Goodness and Kindness to me as usual or at least with so little Difference that had not the Gentleman's Officiousness made me more watchful I should not have perceived it  But next Day a Letter was brought by a Footman for Mr  B  He was out So  John  gave it to me The Superscription was a Lady's Writing The Seal the Dowager Lady's with a Coronet This gave me great Uneasiness And when Mr  B  came in I said Here is a Letter for you Sir and from a Lady too  What then said he with Quickness  I was balked and withdrew For I saw him turn the Seal about and about as if he would see if I had endeavour'd to look into it  He needed not to have been so afraid for I would not have done such a Thing had I known my Life was to depend upon it  I went up and could not help weeping at his quick Answer yet I did my Endeavour to hide it when he came up  Was not my Girl a little inquisitive upon me just now  I spoke pleasantly Sir But you were very quick upon your Girl  'Tis my Temper my DearYou know I mean nothing You should not mind it  I should not Sir if I had been  used  to it  He look'd at me with Sternness Do you doubt my Honour Madam  Madam  did you say Sir I won't take that Word Dear Sir call it back I won't be call'd  Madam  Call me your Girl your Rustick your  Pamela  Call me any thing but  Madam  My Charmer then my Life my Soul will any of those do and saluted me But whatever you do let me not see that you have any Doubts of my Honour to you  The very Mention of the Word dear Sir is a Security to me I want no other I cannot doubt But if you speak short to me how shall I bear that  He withdrew speaking nothing of the Contents of his Letter as I dare say he would had the Subject been such as he chose to mention to me  We being alone after Supper I took the Liberty to ask him Who was of his Party to  Oxford  He nam'd the Viscountess and her Lord Mr  Howard  and his Daughter Mr  Herbert  and his Lady And I had a Partner too my Dear to  present you  I am much obliged to the Lady Sir be she who she would  Why my Dear you are  so  ingag'd in your Nursery Then this was a sudden Thing as you know I told you  Nay Sir as long as it was agreeable to you I had nothing to do but to be pleas'd with it  He watched my Eyes and the Turn of my CountenanceYou look  Pamela  as if you'd be glad to return the Lady Thanks in Person Shall I ingage her to visit you She longs to see you  SirSirhesitated Ias you please I can't beI can't bedispleased  Displeased  interrupted he why that Word And why that Hesitation in your Answer You speak very volubly my Dear when you're not moved  Dear Sir said I almost as quick as himself Why should I be moved What Occasion is there for it I hope you have a better Opinion of me than  Than what  Pamela  What would you say I know you're a little jealous Slut I know you are  But dear Sir why should you think of imputing Jealousy to me on  this  ScoreWhat a Creature must I be if you could not be abroad with a Lady but I must be jealous of youNo Sir I have Reason to rely upon your Honour and I  do  rely upon it and  And what Why my Dear you are giving me Assurances as if you thought the Case requir'd it  Ah thought I so it does I see too plainly or apprehend I do but I durst not say so nor give him any Hint about my Informant tho' now I was enough confirmed of the Truth of what Mr  Turner  had told me  Yet I resolved if possible not to alter my Conduct But my frequent Weepings when by  myself could not be hid as I wished my Eyes not keeping my Heart's Counsel  And this gives Occasion to some of the stern Words which I have mention'd above  All that he further said at this Time was with a negligent yet a determin'd AirWell  Pamela  don't be doubtful of my Honour You know how much I love you But one Day or other I shall gratify this Lady's Curiosity and will bring her to pay you a Visit and you shall see you need not be asham'd of her AcquaintanceWhenever you please Sir was all I car'd to say farther for I saw he was upon the Catch and look'd stedfastly upon me whenever I mov'd my Lips and I am not a finish'd Hypocrite and he can read the Lines of one's Face and the Motions of one's Heart I think  I am sure mine is a very uneasy one But 'till I reflected and weigh'd well the Matter it was worse and my natural Imperfection of this sort made me see a Necessity to be the more watchful over myself and to doubt my own Prudence And thus I reason'd when he withdrew  Here thought I I have had a greater Proportion of Happiness without Alloy fallen to my Share than any of my Sex and I ought to be prepar'd for some Trials  'Tis true this is of the sorest Kind 'tis worse than Death itself to me who had an Opinion of the dear Gentleman's Reformation and prided myself not a little on that Account So that the Blow is full upon my sore Place 'Tis on the Side I could be the most easily penetrated But  Achilles  could be touched only in his Heel and if he was to die by an Enemy's Hand must not the Arrow find out that only vulnerable Place My Jealousy is that Place with me as your Ladyship observes  See this  Vol  p      but is  seated deeper than the Heel It is in my  Heart  and the barbed Dart has found it out and there it sticks up to the very Feathers  Yet thought I I will take care that I do not exasperate him by Upbraidings when I should try to move him by Patience and Forbearance For the Breach of  his  Duty cannot warrant the Neglect of  mine  My Business is to reclaim and not to provoke And when if it please God this Storm shall be overblown let me not by my present Behaviour leave any Room for Heartburnings but like a skilful Surgeon so heal the Wound to the Bottom tho' the Operation be painful that it may not fester and break out again with fresh Violence on future Misunderstandings if any shall happen  He is a young Gentleman has been used to have his own Will thought I This may be a permitted Stumblingblock in his Way to make him stand the firmer when recover'd The Lady may be unhappy that she cannot conquer her faulty Love They may both see their Error and stop short of Crime If not he is a Gentleman of fine Sense he may run an undue Length but may reclaim and then I shall be  his  Superior by my preserved Virtue and Duty and have it in my Power to forgive the dear Gentleman and so repay him some of those Obligations which I shall never otherwise have it in my Power to repaynor indeed wish to have it in this way if it please God to prevent it  Then thought I how much better is it to be the  suffering  than the  offending  PersonBut yet Madam to have so fine a Gentleman who had advanced so far up the Hill of Virtue to slide back all at once and between your Ladyship and me to have him sink down to the Character he had despised and at last if his dear Life should be spared as is my hourly Prayer to have him carry  his Vices into advanced Years and become such a poor Gentleman as we see Sir  Simon Darnford  retaining a Love of his juvenile Follies even after the Practice has left him how my Heart shudders at such a Thought for my Mr  B  Well but thought I let the worst come to the worst he may perhaps be so good as to permit me to pass the Remainder of my Days with my dear  Billy  in  Kent  with my Father and Mother and so when I cannot rejoice in Possession of a virtuous Husband I shall be imploy'd in praying for him and injoy a two fold Happiness that of doing my own Duty to my dear Babyand a pleasing Entertainment that will beand that of comforting my worthy Parents and being comforted by them and no small Consolation thisAnd who knows but I may be permitted to steal a Visit nowandthen to dear Lady  Davers  and be called Sister and be deem'd a  faultless  Sister tooand that will be a fine Thing But remember my dear Lady that if ever it come to this I will not bear that for my sake you shall with too much Asperity blame your dear Brother for I will be ingenious to find Excuses or Extenuations for him and I will nowandthen in some disguised Habit steal the Pleasure of seeing him and his happier Countess and give him with a silent Tear my Blessing for the Good I and mine have reaped at his dear Hands  But oh if he takes from me my dear  Billy  who must after all be his Heir and gives him to the cruel Countess he will at once burst asunder the Strings of my Heart For Oh my happy Rivaless if you tear from me my Husband he is in his own Disposal and I cannot help it Nor can I indeed if he will give you my  Billy  But this I am sure of that my Child and my Life must go together  Your Ladyship will think I rave Indeed I am almost crazed at times For the dear Gentleman is so negligent so cold so haughty that I cannot bear it He says just now You are quite alter'd  Pamela  I believe I am Madam But what can I do He knows not that I know so much I dare not tell him For he will have me then reveal my Intelligencer And what may be the Case between them  I weep in the Night when he is asleep and in the Day when he is absent And I am happy when I can unobserv'd steal this poor Relief I believe already I have shed as many Tears as would drown my poor Baby How many more I may have to shed God only knows For oh Madam after all my Fortitude and my Recollection to fall from so much Happiness and so soon is a trying Thing  But I will hope still the best and resign to God's Will and his and see how far the dear Gentleman will be permitted to exercise me So don't my good Lady be overmuch concern'd for meFor you know I am apt to be too apprehensive And should this Matter blow over I shall be asham'd of my Weakness and the Trouble I must give to your generous Heart for one so undeservedly favour'd by you as is  Your obliged Sister and most humble Servant  P B  Dear my Lady let no Soul see any Part of this our present Correspondence for your dear Brother's sake and your sake and my sake  LETTER XXXI  My dearest  PAMELA  YOU need not be afraid of any body's knowing what passes between us on this cutting Subject Tho' I hear of it from every Mouth yet  I pretend 'tis all Falshood and Malice Yet Lady  Betty  will have it that there is more in it than I will own and that I know my Brother's Wickedness by my pensive Looks She will make a Vow she says never to marry any Man living  I am greatly mov'd by your affecting Periods Charming  Pamela  what a Tempest do you raise in one's Mind when you please and lay it too at your own Will Your Colourings are strong but I hope your Imagination carries you much farther than it is possible he should go  I am pleased with your prudent Reasonings and your wise Resolutions I see nobody can advise or help you God only can And his Direction you beg  so  hourly that I make no doubt you will have it  What vexes me is that on the noble Uncle of this vile Ladywhy don't you call her so as well as Iexpostulating with her on the Scandals she brought on her Character and Family she pretended to argue foolish Creature for Polygamy and said She had rather be a certain Gentleman's second Wife than the first to the greatest Man in  England  I leave you to your own Workings but if I find your Prudence unrewarded by the Wretch the Storm you saw raised at the Hall shall be nothing to the Hurricane I will excite to tear up by the Roots all the Happiness the two Wretches propose to themselves  Don't let my Intelligence which is undoubted grieve you overmuch Try some way to move the Wretch What must be done must be by touching his Generosity He has that in some Perfection But how in  this  Case to move it is beyond my Power or Skill to prescribe  God bless you my dearest  Pamela  You shall be my  only  Sister And I will never own my Brother  if he be so base to your superlative Merit Adieu once more  From your Sister and Friend  B DAVERS  LETTER XXXII  My dearest Lady  A Thousand Thanks for your kind your truly Sisterly Letter and Advice Mr  B  is just return'd from a Tour to  Portsmouth  I believe with the Countess but am not sure  Here I am forc'd to leave offLet me scratch thro' this last Surmise It seems she was not with him This is some Comfort however  He is very kind and  Billy  not being well when he came in my Grief passed off without Blame He has said a great many kind Things to me But added That if I gave myself so much Uneasiness every Time the Child ailed any thing he would hire the Nurse to overlay him Bless me Madam what hardhearted what shocking Things are these Men capable of sayingThe farthest from their Hearts indeed so they had needFor he was as glad of the Child's being better as I could be  In the Morning he went out in the Chariot for about an Hour and return'd in a very good Humour saying twenty agreeable Things to me which makes me so proud and so pleas'd  He is gone out again  Could I but find this Matter happily conquer'd for his own Soul's sakeBut he seems by what your Ladyship mentions to have carry'd this Polygamy Point with the Lady  Can I live with him MadamOught Iif this be the Case I have it under his Hand that the  Laws of his Country were sufficient to deter him from this Practice But oh he knew not this Countess then They say she is a fine Woman  But here I must break off He is return'd and coming up Go into my Bosom for the present O Letter dedicated to dear Lady  Davers  Come to my Hand the Play Imployment so unsuited to my present afflicted MindHere he comes  O but Madam Madam my Heart is almost brokenJust now Mr  B  tells me that the CountessDowager and the Viscountess her Sister are to be here to see my  Billy  and to drink Tea with me this very Afternoon  I was all Confusion when he told me this I looked around and around and upon every thing but him  Will not my Friends be welcome  Pamela  said he sternly  O yes Sir very welcomeBut I have those nasty Vapours so that I wish I might be excus'd I wish I might be allow'd to take an Airing in the Chariot for two or three Hours for I shall not be fit to be seen by suchLadiessaid I half out of Breath  You'll be fit to be seen by nobody my Dear if you go on thusBut do as you please  He was going and I took his Hand Stay dear Sir let me know what you would have me to do If you would have me stay I will  To be sure I would  Well Sir then I will For it is hard thought I if an innocent Person cannot look up in her own House too as it is at present as I may say to a guilty oneGuilty in her Heart at leastTho' poor Lady I hope she is not so in Fact and if  God hears my Prayers never will for all Three of our sakes  But Madam think for me what a Task I have How my Heart throbs in my Bosom How I tremble How I struggle with myself What Rules I form for my Behaviour to this naughty Lady How they are dash'd in Pieces as soon as form'd and new ones taken up And yet I doubt myself when I come to the Test  But one Thing will help me I  pity  the poor Lady and as she comes with the Heart of a Robber to invade me in my lawful Right I pride myself in a Superiority over this Countess and will endeavour to shew her the CountryGirl in a Light which would better become  her  to appear in  I must be forced to leave off here for Mr  B  is just come in to receive his Guests and I am in a sad Flutter upon it All my Resolution fails me What shall I doO that this Countess was come and gone I tremble so that I shall behave like a guilty one before the Guilty who will injoy their Minds I'll warrant as if they were innocent Why should that be But surely if all was bad as this  Turner  has said they could not act thus barbarously by me For I have not deserv'd to be given up to be insulted I hope I have not For what have I done  I have one Comfort however in the midst of all my Griefs and that is in your Ladyship's Goodness who gives me Leave to assume the honour'd Title that let what will happen will always give me equal Pride and Pleasure in subscribing myself  Your Ladyship's obliged Sister and humble Servant  P B  LETTER XXXIII  My dear Lady  I Will now pursue my last affecting Subject for the Visit is over But a sad Situation I am in with Mr  B  for all that But I'll try to forget it till I come to it in course bad as it is  At Four in the Afternoon Mr  B  came in to receive his Guests whom he expected at Five He came up to me I had just closed my last Letter but put it up and set before me your Ladyship's Play Subjects  So  Pamela  How do you now  Your Ladyship may guess by what I wrote before that I could not give any extraordinary Account of myselfAs wellAs well Sir as possibleHalf out of Breath  You give yourself strange melancholy Airs of late my DearYou don't do wellAll that Chearfulness which used to delight me whenever I saw you I'm sorry for it is quite vanish'd of lateYou and I must shortly have a little serious Talk together  When you please SirI believe it is only not being us'd to this smoaky thick Air of  London  I shall be better when you carry me into the CountryI dare say I shallBut I never was in  London  so long before you know Sir  All in good time  Pamela  But is this the best Appearance you chuse to make to receive such Guests  If it displease you Sir I will dress otherwise in a Minute  You look well in any thingBut I thought you'd have had your JewelsYet they would never have  less become you for of late your Eyes have lost that Brilliancy that used to strike me with a Lustre much surpassing that of the finest Diamonds  I am sorry for it SirBut as I never could pride myself in deserving such a kind Compliment I should be too happy forgive me my dearest Mr  B  if the Failure be not rather in  your  Eyes than  my own    He looked at me stedfastlyI fear  Pamela  But don't be a Fool  You are angry with me Sir  No not I  Would you have me dress better  No not IIf your Eyes look'd a little more brilliant you want no Addition  Down he went  Strange short Speeches these my Lady to what you have heard from his dear MouthYet they shall not rob me of the Merit of a patient Sufferer I am resolv'd thought I  Now my Lady as I doubted not my Rival would come adorn'd with every outward Ornament I put on only a white Damask Gown having no Desire to vie with her in Appearance for a virtuous and honest Heart is my Glory I bless God I wish the Countess had the same to boast of  About Five their Ladyships came in the Countess's new Chariot for she has not been long out of her transitory Mourning and dress'd as rich as Jewels and a Profusion of Expence could make her  I saw them from the Window alight O how my Heart throbb'dLie still said I busy Thing Why all this EmotionThose shining Ornaments cover not such a guileless Flutterer as thou Why then all this Emotion  I would not be so officious as to be below to receive them  Polly Barlow  came up instantly from Mr  B  I hastened down tremble tremble tremble went my Feet in spite of all the Resolution I had been so long endeavouring to collect together  Mr  B  presented the Countess to me both of us cover'd with Blushes but from very different Motives as I imagine  The Countess of my Dear  She saluted me and looked as I thought half with Envy half with Shame But one is apt to form Peoples Countenances by what one judges of their Hearts  O too lovely too charming Rivaless thought I Would to Heaven I saw less Attractions in you For indeed indeed Madam she is a charming Lady Yet she could not help calling me Mrs  B  that was some Pride and said She had heard me so much praised that she quite long'd to see me  Oh these villainous Masquerades thought I You would never have wanted to see me but for them poor naughty Nun that was  Mr  B  presented also the Viscountess to me I saluted her Ladyship her Sister saluted me  She is a graceful Lady better as I hope in Heart but not equal in Person to her Sister  You have taken no Pains my Dear in your Dress Today  The Ladies will excuse it Sir I am so often in the Nursery when you are absent  Mrs  B  answers her Character said the Countess she wants no Ornaments You have a charming little Master I am told Madam but no Wonder from such a Pair  O dear Heart thought I i'n't it soYour Ladyship may guess what I thought further  Will your Ladyship see him now said Mr  B  He did not look down no not one bittho' the Countess play'd with her Fan and looked at him  and looked at me and then looked down by Turns a little consciously While I wrapt up myself in my Innocence my first Flutters being over and thought I was superior by reason of that to a Countess  With all my Heart Mr  B  said she  I rang  Polly  bid Nurse bring  my Billy  down  My  said I with an Emphasis  I met the Nurse at the Stairs Foot and brought in my dear Baby in my Arms Such a Child and such a Mamma said the Viscountess  Will you give Master to my Arms one Moment Madam said the Countess  Yes thought I much rather than my dear naughty Gentleman should any other  I  yielded  it to her I thought she would have stifled it with her warm Kisses Sweet Boy Charming Creature And press'd it to her too lovely Bosom with such Emotion looking on the Child and on Mr  B  that I liked it not by any means  Go you naughty Lady thought IBut I durst not say so And go naughty Man too thought I for you seem to look too much gratify'd in your Pride by her Fondness for your Boy I wish I did not love you so well as I doBut neither your Ladyship may believe did I say this  Mr  B  looked at me but with a Bravery I thought too like what I had seen him look in some former Scenes in as bad a CauseBut thought I GOD delivered me  then  I will confide in Him He will  now  I doubt not restore thy Heart to my Prayers untainted I hope for thy own dear sake as well as mine  The Viscountess took the Child from her Sister and kissed him with great Pleasure She is a marry'd Lady Would to GOD the Countess was too for Mr  B  never corresponded as I told your Ladyship  once  See  Vol III  p    with marry'd Ladies So I was not afraid of her Love to my  Billy  But let me said the Viscountess have the Pleasure of restoring Master to his charming Mamma I thought added she I never saw a lovelier Sight in my Life than when in his Mamma's Arms  Why I  can't say  said the Countess but Master and his Mamma do Credit to one another Dear Madam let us have the Pleasure of seeing him still on your Lap while he is so good  I wonder'd the dear Baby was so quiet tho' he is generally so But  he  might surely if but by Sympathy have complained for his poor Mamma tho' she durst not for herself  How apt one is to ingage every thing in one's Distress when it is deep And one wonders too that Things animate and inanimate look with the same Face when we are greatly moved by any extraordinary and interesting Event  I sat down with my Baby on my Lap looking I believe with a righteous Boldness I will call it so for well says the Text  The Righteous is as bold as a Lion  now on my  Billy  now on his dear Papa and now on the Countess with such a  Triumph  in my Heart for I saw her blush and look down and the dear Gentleman seem'd to eye me with a kind of conscious Tenderness as I thought  A Silence of five Minutes I believe succeeded we all Four looking upon one another and the little Dear was awake and stared full upon me with such innocent Smiles as if he promised to love me and make me Amends for all  I kissed him and took his pretty little Hand in mineYou are very good my Charmer in this noble Company said I  I remember'd Madam a Scene that made greatly for me in the Papers you have seen  See  Vol I  p    when instead of recriminating as I might have done before Mr  Longman  for hard Usage for Oh my Lady your dear Brother has a hard Heart indeed he has when he pleases I only prayed for him on my Knees  And I hope I was not now too mean for I had Dignity and a proud Superiority in my vain Heart over them allThen it was not my Part to be upon Defiances where I lov'd and where I hoped to reclaim Besides what had I done by it but justify'd seemingly by AfterActs in a passionate Resentment to their Minds at least their too wicked Treatment of me Moreover your Ladyship will remember that Mr  B  knew not that I was acquainted with his Intrigue I must call it soIf he had he is too noble to insult me by such a Visit and he had told me I should see the Lady he was at  Oxford  with  And this breaking Silence he mention'd saying I gave you Hope my Dear that I should procure you the Honour of a Visit from the Lady who put herself under my Care at  Oxford    I bow'd my Head to the Countess but my Tears being ready to start I kiss'd my  Billy  Dearest Baby said I you are not going to cry are youI would have had him just then to cry instead of me  The Tea Equipage was brought in  Polly  carry the Child to Nurse I gave it another Kiss and the Countess desired another I grudged it to think her naughty Lips should so closely follow mine Her Sister kissed it also and carry'd him to Mr  B  Take him away  Polly  said heI owe him my Blessing  Oh these young Gentlemen Papa's said the CountessThey are like young unbroken Horses  just put into the TracesAre they so thought I Matrimony must not expect your good Word I doubt  Mr  B  after Tea at which I was far from being talkative for I could not tell what to say tho' I try'd as much as I could not to appear sullen desir'd the Countess to play one Tune upon the Spinnet She did and sung at his Request an  Italian  Song to it very prettily too prettily I thought I wanted to find some Faults some great Faults in her But Oh Madam she has too many outward Excellencies Pity she wants a good Heart  He could ask nothing that she was not ready to oblige him in Indeed he could not  She desired  me  to touch the Keys I would have been excus'd but could not And the Ladies commended my Performance But neither my Heart to play nor my Fingers in playing deserv'd their Praises Mr  B said  indeed You play better sometimes my DearDo I Sir was all the Answer I made  The Countess hoped she said I would return her Visit and so said the Viscountess  I reply'd Mr  B  would command me whenever he pleas'd  She said She hoped to be better acquaintedI hope not thought I and that I would give her my Company for a Week or so upon the Forest It seems she has a Seat upon  Windsor  Forest  Mr  B  says added she you can't ride a single Horse but we'll learn you there 'Tis a sweet Place for that Purpose  How came Mr  B  thought I to tell  you  that Madam I suppose you know more of me than I do myself Indeed my Lady this may be too true for she may know what is to become of me  I told her I was very much oblig'd to her Ladyship but Mr  B  directed all my Motions  What say you Sir said the Countess  I can't promise that Madam for Mrs  B  wants to go down to  Kent  before we go to  Bedfordshire  and I am afraid I can't give her my Company thither  Then Sir I shan't chuse to go without you  I suppose not my Dear But if you are disposed to oblige the Countess for a Week as you never were at  Windsor    I believe Sir interrupted I what with my little Nursery and  one  thing or  another  I must deny myself that Honour for this Season  Well Madam then I'll expect you in  Pallmall    I bow'd my Head and said Mr  B  would command me  They took Leave with a Politeness natural to them  Mr  B  as he handed them to their Chariot said something in  Italian  to the Countess The Word  Pamela  was in what he said She answer'd him with a downcast Look in the same Language half pleas'd half serious and the Chariot drove away  I would give said I a good deal Sir to know what her Ladyship said to you she look'd with so particular a Meaning if I may so say  I'll tell you truly  Pamela  I said to her Well now your Ladyship has seen my  Pamela  Is she not the charming'st Girl in the World  She answer'd Mrs  B  is very grave for so young a Lady But I must needs say She is a lovely Creature  And did you say so Sir And did her Ladyship so answerAnd my Heart was ready to leap out of my Bosom for Joy  But my Folly spoil'd all again for to my own Surprize and great Regret I burst out into Tears tho' I even sobb'd to have suppress'd them but could not and so I lost a fine Opportunity to have talked to him while he was so kind For he was angry with me  What made me such a Fool I wonder But I had so long struggled with myself and not expecting so kind a Question from the dear Gentleman or such a favourable Answer from the Countess I had no longer any Command of myself  What ails the little Fool said he with a wrathful Countenance that made me worseTake care take care  Pamela  You'll drive me from you in spite of my own Heart  So he went into the best Parlour and put on his Sword and took his Hat Sir Sir with my Arms expanded was all I could say but he avoided me putting on his Hat with an Air and out he went bidding  Abraham  follow him  This is the Dilemma into which as I hinted at the Beginning of this Letter I have brought myself with Mr  B  How strong how prevalent is the Passion of Jealousy that thus it will shew itself uppermost when it is uppermost in spite of one's most watchful Regards  My Mind is so perplex'd that I must lay down my Pen And indeed your Ladyship will wonder all Things consider'd that I could write the above Account as I have done in this cruel Suspense and with such Apprehensions But Writing is all the Diversion I have when my Mind is oppress'd 'Tis a temporary Relief and this Interview was so interesting that it took up a great deal of my Attention while I wrote But now I am come to a Period of it and so unhappy an one as has resulted from my ungovern'd Passion my Apprehensions are return'd  upon me with double Strength Why did I drive the dear Gentleman from me upon such a promising AppearanceWhy did IBut all this had been prevented had not this nasty Mr  Turner  put into my Head worse Thoughts  How shall I do to look up to him now on his Return To be sure he plainly sees to what my Emotion is owingYet I dare not tell him either my Information or my Informant because if he knows the one he will know the other and then what may be the Consequence  Past Ten o'clock at Night  I have only Time to tell your Ladyship for the Postman waits that Mr  B  is just come in he is gone into his Closet and has shut the Door and taken the Key on the Inside so I dare not go to him there In this Uncertainty and Suspense pity and pray for  Your Ladyship's afflicted Sister and Servant  P B  LETTER XXXIV  My dear Lady  I Will now proceed with my melancholy Account  Not knowing what to do and Mr  B  not coming near me and the Clock striking Twelve I ventur'd to send this Billet to him by  Polly    Dear Sir  I Know you chuse not to be invaded when you retire into your Closet and yet being very uneasy on account of your abrupt Departure and heavy Displeasure I take the Liberty to write these few Lines  I own Sir that the sudden Flow of Tears which involuntarily burst from me at your kind Expressions  to the Countess in my Favour when I had thought for more than a Month past you were angry with me and which had distress'd my weak Mind beyond Expression might appear unaccountable to you But had you kindly waited but one Moment till this Fit which was rather owing to my Joy and my Gratitude than to Perverseness had been over and I knew the Time when you would have generously soothed it I should have had the Happiness of a more serene and favourable Parting  Will you permit me Sir  Polly  shall wait your Answer to attend you I dare not come  without  your Permission for should you be as angry as you were I know not how I should bear it But if you say I may come down I hope to satisfy you that I intended not any Offence Do dear Sir permit me to attend you I can say no more than that I am  Your ever dutiful  P B  Polly  return'd with the following So thought I a Letter I could have spared that I am sure I expected no Favour from it So tremblingly open'd it  My Dear  I Would not have you sit up for me We are getting apace into the matrimonial Recriminations  You knew the Time  So did I my Dear But it seems that Time is over with both and I have had the Mortification for some past Weeks I may say to come home to a very different  Pamela  than I used to leave all Company and all Pleasure for I hope we shall better understand one another But you cannot see me at present with any Advantage to yourself  and I would not that any thing farther should pass to add to the Regrets of both I wish you good Rest I will give your Cause a fair Hearing when I am more fit than at present to hear all your Pleas and your Excuses I cannot be insensible that the Reason for the Concern you have lately shewn must lie deeper than perhaps you'll own at present As soon as you are prepared to speak all that is upon your Mind and I to hear it with Temper then we may come to an Eclaircissement 'Till when I am  Your affectionate  c  My busy Apprehension immediately suggested to me that I was to be terrified with a high Hand into a Compliance with some new Scheme or other that was projecting But I had resolved to make their Way as clear to one another as was in my Power if they would have it so and so I try'd to allay my Grief as much as I could and it being near One and hearing nothing from Mr  B  I bid  Polly  go to Bed thinking she would wonder at our Intercourse by Letter if I should send again  So down I ventur'd my Feet however trembling all the way and tapp'd at the Door of his Closet  Who's that  I Sir One Word if you please Don't be more angry however Sir  He open'd the Door Thus poor  Hester  to her Royal Husband ventur'd her Life to break in upon him unbidden But that  Eastern  Monarch great as he was extended to the fainting Suppliant the golden Sceptre  He took my Hand I hope my Dear by this Tragedy Speech we are not to expect any sad Catastrophe to our present Misunderstanding  I hope not Sir But 'tis all as God and you shall please I am resolv'd to do my Duty Sir if possible But indeed I cannot bear this cruel Suspense Let me know what is to become of me Let me know but what is design'd for me and you shall be sure of all the Acquiescence that my Duty and Conscience can give to your Pleasure  What  means  the dear Creature What  means  my  Pamela  Surely your Head Child is a little affected  I can't tell Sir but it may But let me have my Trial that you write about Appoint my Day of Hearing and speedily too for I would not bear such another Month as the last has been for the World  Come my Dear said he let me attend you to your Chamber But your Mind has taken much too solemn a Turn to enter further now upon this Subject Think as well of me as I do of you and I shall be happy as ever  I weptBe not angry dear Sir Your kind Words have just the same Effect upon me now as in the Afternoon  Your Apprehensions my Dear must be very strong that a kind Word as you call it has such an Effect upon you But let us wave the Subject for a few Days because I am to set out on a little Journey at Four and had not intended to go to Bed for so few Hours  When we came up I said I was very bold Sir to break in upon you but I could not help it if my Life had been the Forfeit And you receiv'd me with more Goodness than I could have expected But will you pardon me if I ask Whither you go so soon And if you had intended to have gone without taking Leave of me  I go to  Tunbridge  my Dear I should have stept up and taken Leave of you before I went  Well Sir I will not ask you Who is of your Party I will not No putting my Hand to his Lips Don't tell me Sir It mayn't be proper  Don't fear my Dear I won't tell you Nor am I certain whether it be  proper  or not till we are come to a better UnderstandingOnly once more think as well of me as I do of you  Would to Heaven thought I there was the same Reason for the one as the other  I intended for my Heart was full to enter further into this Subject so fatal to my Repose But the dear Gentleman had no sooner laid his Hand on the Pillow but he fell asleep or seem'd to do so and that was as prohibitory to my Talking as if he had So I had all my own entertaining Reflections to myself which gave me not one Wink of Sleep but made me of so much Service to him as to tell him when the Clock struck Four that he should not tho' I did not say so you may think Madam make my ready Rivaless for I doubted not her being one of the Party wait for him  He arose and was dress'd instantly and saluting me bid me be easy and happy while it was  yet  in my own Power  He said He should be back on  Saturday  Night as he believ'd And I wish'd him most fervently I am sure Health Pleasure and Safety  Here Madam must I end this Letter My next will perhaps contain my Trial and my Sentence God give me but Patience and Resignation and then whatever occurs I shall not be unhappy Especially while I can have in the last Resource the Pleasure of calling myself  Your Ladyship's most obliged Sister and Servant  P B  LETTER XXXV  My dear Lady  I Will be preparing to write to you as I have Opportunity not doubting but this present Letter must be a long one and having some Apprehensions that as things may fall out I may want either Head or Heart to write to your Ladyship were I to defer it till the Catastrophe of this cruel cruel Suspense  O what a Happiness am I sunk from And in so few Days tooO the wicked wicked Masquerades They shall be always followed with the Execrations of an injured Wife in me who but for that wretched Diversion had still been the happiest of her Sex  But I was too secure It was fit perhaps that I should be humbled and mortified and I must try to make a Virtue of the cruel Necessity and see if by the Divine Grace I cannot bring  real  Good out of this  appearing  Evil  The following Letter in a Woman's Hand and sign'd as you'll see by a Woman's Name and spelt as I spell it will account to your Ladyship for my beginning so heavily It came by the PenyPost  Madame  I Ame unknowne to yowe but yowe are nott so altogathar to mee becaus I haue bene edefy'd by yowre pius Behafior att Church whir I see yowe with Plaisir everie

thof I shall not sett my trewe Name  Yowre grete Admirer and Seruant  Thomasine Fuller  Wednesday  Morninge o'Clocke  Just above I called my State a State of  cruel Suspense  But I recall the Words For now it is no longer Suspense since if this Letter says Truth I know the worst And there is too much Appearance that it does let the Writer be who it will or his or her Motive what it will for after all I am apt to fansy this a Contrivance of Mr  Turner  's tho' for fear of ill Consequences I will not say so  And now Madam I am endeavouring by the Help of Religion and cool Reflection to bring my Mind to bear this heavy Evil and to recollect what I  was  and how much more honourable an Estate I  am in  than I could ever have expected to be and that my Virtue and good Name are secur'd and I can return innocent to my dear Father and Mother And these were once the only Pride of my Hope  Then additional to what I was at that Time and yet I pleased myself with my Prospects poor as they were I have honest Parents bountifully provided for thank God and your ever dear Brother for this Blessingand not only provided forbut made  useful to him to the Amount of their Provision well nigh There is a Pride my Lady  Then I shall have better Conditions from his Generosity to support myself than I can wish for or make use of  Then I have my dear charming  Billy  O be contented too charming and too happy Rivaless with my Husband and tear not from me my dearest Baby the Pledge the beloved Pledge of our happier Affections and the dear Remembrance of what I once was But if my dear Mr  B  you doubt the Education I can give him fit for the Heir to your great Fortune for such he must be despised or abandon'd as his poor Mother may be and will remove him from me and Grief kill me not before that sad Hour let me have some Office not incompatible with that of his Tutor to instil Virtue into his ductile Mind for Tutors altho' they may make Youth learned do not always make them virtuous and let me watch over his Steps and whereever he goes let me go I shall value no Dangers nor Risques the most distant Clime shall be native to me whereever my  Billy  is so that I may be a Guard under God to his Morals that he make no Virgin's Heart sigh nor Mother's bleed as mine has done in both States  But how I rave will your Ladyship be apt to say This is no good Symptom you'll think that I have reap'd at present that Consolation from religious Considerations which to a right Turn of Mind they will afford in the heaviest Misfortunes But this was only in fear they would take my  Billy  from me A thousand pleasing Prospects that had begun to dawn on my Mind I can bear to have dissipated but I cannot permit my dear Mr  B  's Son and Heir to be torn from me  Yet I hope they will not be so cruel for I will give them no Provocation to do it if I can help it No Lawsuits no Complainings no Asperities of Expression much less bitter Reflections shall they ever have from me I will be no Conscience to them They will be punished too much greatly too much in their own for what I wish and they shall always be followed by my Prayers I shall have Leisure for that Exercise and shall be happy and serene when I doubt I doubt they will not be so  But still I am running on in a Strain that shews my Impatience rather than my Resignation Yet some Struggles must be allow'd me I could not have loved as I love if I could easily part with my Interest in so beloved a Husband For Madam my Interest I will part with and will sooner die than live with a Gentleman who has another Wife tho' I was the first Let Countesses if they can and Ladies of Birth chuse to humble themselves to this BasenessThe lowborn  Pamela  cannot stoop to such Meanness Pardon me Madam you know I only write this with a View to this poor Lady's Answer to her noble Uncle of which you wrote me Word  FRIDAY  Is now concluding I hope I am calmer a great deal For being disappointed in all Likelihood of twenty agreeable Schemes and Projects I am now forming new ones with as much Pleasure to myself as I may For my Lady 'tis one's Duty you know to suit one's Mind to one's Condition and I hope I shall be inabled to do Good in  Kent  if I cannot in  London  and  Bedfordshire  and  Lincolnshire  God everywhere provides us with Objects on which to exercise one's Gratitude and Beneficence  I am thinking to try to get good Mrs  Jervis  with me  Come Madam you must not be too much concern'd for me After a while I shall be no unhappy Person for tho' I was thankful for my splendid Fortunes and should have been glad to be sure I should of continuing in them with so dear a Gentleman yet a high Estate had never such dazzling Charms with me as it has with some If it had I could not have resisted so many Temptations possibly as God inabled me to resist  SATURDAY Night  Is now come 'Tis Nine and no Mr  B  O why as  Deborah  makes the Mother of  Sisera  say is his Chariot so long in coming Why tarry the Wheels of his Chariot  I have this Note now at Eleven o'Clock  My dearest  Pamela    'I Dispatch this Messenger lest expecting me this Night you should be uneasy I shall not be with you till  Monday  when I hope to dine with my dearest Life'  Ever affectionately yours  So I'll go up and pray for him and then to Bed Yet 'tis a sad thing I have had but poor Rest for a great while nor shall have any till my Fate is decided Hardhearted Gentleman he knows under what Uneasiness he left me  MONDAY Eleven  If God Almighty hears my Yesterday's and indeed my hourly Prayers the dear Gentleman will be good still But my aking Heart every Time I  think in what Company he is for I find the Countess is certainly one of the Party bodes me little Satisfaction  He's come He's come now just now come I will have my Trial over before this Night be past if possible I'll go down and meet him with Love unfeigned and a Duty equal to my Love altho' he may forget his to me If I conquer myself on this Occasion I conquer Nature as your Ladyship says and then by God's Grace I can conquer every thing They have taken their House I suppose but what need they when they'll have one in  Bedfordshire  and one in  Lincolnshire  But they know best God bless him and reform her That's all the Harm I wish them or will wish them  The dear Gentleman has receiv'd me with great Affection and Tenderness Sure he cannot be so bad Sure he cannot  I know my Dear said he I left you in great Anxiety but 'tis an Anxiety you have brought upon yourself and I have not been easy ever since I left you  I am sorry for it Sir  Why my dear Love there is still a melancholy Air in your Countenance Indeed it seems mingled with a kind of Joy I hope at my Return to you But 'tis easy to see which of the two is the most natural  You should see nothing Sir that you would not wish to see if I could help it  I am sorry you cannot reply'd he But I am come Home to hear all your Grievances and to redress them if in my Power  When Sir am I to come upon my Trial I have a great deal to say to you I will tell you every thing I think And as it may be the last Grievances  as you are pleased to call 'em I may ever trouble you with you must promise to answer me not one Word till I have said all I have to say For if it does but hold I have great Courage I have indeed You don't know half the Sauciness that is in your Girl yet but when I come upon my Trial you'll wonder at my Boldness  What means my Dearest and took me in his Arms You alarm me exceedingly by this moving Sedateness  Don't let it alarm you Sir I mean you nothing but Good But I have been preparing myself to tell you all my Mind And as an Instance of what you may expect from me sometimes Sir I will be your Judge and put home Questions to you and sometimes you shall be mine and at last pronounce Sentence upon me or if you won't I will upon myself a severe one to me it shall be but an agreeable one perhaps to you When comes on the Trial Sir  He looked steadily upon me but was silent And I said But don't be afraid Sir I will invade your Province for tho' I shall count myself your Judge in some Cases you shall be Judge Paramount still  Dear Charmer of my Heart said he and clasped me to his Bosom what a  new  PAMELA have I in my Arms A mysterious Charmer Let us instantly go to my Closet or yours and come upon our mutual Trial for you have fir'd my Soul with Impatience  No Sir if you please we will dine first I have hardly eaten any thing these four Days and your Company will give me an Appetite perhaps I shall be pleas'd to sit down at Table with you Sir takeing his Hand and trying to smile upon him for the Moments I may have of your Company may be some Time hence very precious to my Remembrance  I was forced then to turn my Head to hide from him my Eyes brimful as they were of Tears  He took me again in his Arms My dearest  Pamela  if you love me distract not my Soul thus by your dark and mysterious Speeches You are displeased with me and I thought I had Reason to take something amiss in your late Conduct but instead of your suffering by my Anger you have Words and an Air that penetrate my very Soul  O Sir Sir treat me not thus kindly Put on an awfuller Brow or how shall I retain my Purpose How shall I  Dear dear Creature make not use of  all  your Powers to melt me  Half  of them is enough For there is Eloquence in your Eyes I cannot resist but in your present solemn Air and affecting Sentences you mould me to every Purpose of your Heart so that I am a mere Machine a passive Instrument to be play'd upon at your Pleasure  Dear kind Sir how you revive my Heart by your Goodness Perhaps I have had only a frightful Dream of a few Weeks Continuance and am but just now awaken'd But we will not anticipate our Trial Only Sir give Orders that you are not to be spoken with by any body when we have din'd for I must have you  all  to my self without Interruption  Just as I had said this a Gentleman called on him and I retir'd to my Chamber and wrote to this Place  Mr  B  dismiss'd his Friend without asking him to dine with him So I had him all to myself at Dinner But we said little and sat not above a Quarter of an Hour looking at each other he with Impatience and some seeming Uneasiness I with  more Steadiness I believe but nowandthen a Tear starting  I could eat but little tho' I try'd all I could and especially as he help'd me and courted me by Words of Tenderness and Sweetness O why were ever such Things as  Masquerades  permitted in a Christian Nation  I chose to go into  my  Closet rather than into  his  and here I sit waiting the dear Gentleman's coming up to me If I keep but my Courage I shall be pleased I know the  worst  and that will help me for he is too noble to use me roughly when he sees I mean not to provoke him by Upbraidings any more than I will act in this Case beneath the Character I ought to assume as his Wife  For my dear Lady this is a Point of high Importance It has touched and rais'd my Soul beyond its Pitch I am a  new Pamela  as he says and a  proud Pamela  as he will find For Madam the Person who can support herself under an Injury like this and can resolve to forgive it has a Superiority to the Injurer let him be a Prince tho' she were but a Beggarborn But the Difficulty will be how to avoid being melted by my own Softness and Love for the Man more dear to me than Life yea more dear to me than my  Billy  and than all my Hopes in the charming Boy But here he comes  Now  Pamela  Now see what thou canst do Thou knowest the worst Remember that And may'st not be unhappy even  at  the worst if thou trustest in GOD  I am commanded my dear Lady now to write particularly my Trial for a Reason I shall mention to you in the Conclusion of this Letter and I must beg you to favour me with the Return of all my  Letters to you on this affecting Subject The Reason will appear in its Place And Oh congratulate me my dear dear Lady for I am happy and shall be happier than I ever was and that I thought so did every body was impossible But I will not anticipate the Account of my Trial and the Effects the blessed Effects it has produced Thus then it was  Mr  B  came up with great Impatience in his Looks I met him at my Chamberdoor with as sedate a Countenance as I possibly could put on and my Heart was high with my Purpose and supported me better than I could have expected Yet on Recollection now I impute to myself something of that kind of noble Enthusiasm that was wont to inspire the innocent Sufferers of old for a still worthier Cause than mine though their Motives could hardly be more pure in that one Hope I had to be an humble Means of saving the Man I love and honour from Errors that might be fatal to his Soul  I took his Hand with Boldness Dear Sir leading him to my Closet Here is the Bar at which I am to take my Trial pointing to the Backs of three Chairs which I had placed in a join'd Row leaving just Room to go by on each Side You must give me Sir all my own Way this is the first and perhaps the last Time that I shall desire it Nay dear Sir turning my Face from him look not upon me with an Eye of Tenderness if you do I may lose my Purposes important to me as they are and however fantastick my Behaviour may seem to you I want not to move your Passions but your Reason and if that can be done I am safe and shall fear no Relapse The others will raise but a transient Hope which the Winds of Sense may easily dissipate and I regard it accordingly  What means all this Parade my Dear Let me perish that was his Word if I know how to account for  You  or your  Humour    You will presently Sir But give me all my Way I pray you do this once this one Time only  Well so this is your Bar is it There's an Elbowchair I see take your Place in it  Pamela  and here I'll stand to answer all your Questions  No Sir that must not be So I boldly led  him  to the Elbowchair You are the Judge Sir it is I that am to be try'd Yet I will not say I am a Criminal I know I am not But that must be proved Sir you know  Well take your way but I fear for your Head my Dear in all this  I fear only my Heart Sir that's all But there you must sit So here retiring to the three Chairs and leaning on the Backs here I stand  And now my dearest Mr  B  you must begin first When you shew'd me the House of Peers their Bar at which Causes are heard and sometimes Peers are try'd look'd awful to me and the present Occasion requires that this should Now dear Sir you must be my Accuser as well as my Judge  I have nothing to accuse you of my Dear if I  must  give into your moving Whimsy You are every thing I wish you to be But for the last Month you have seem'd to be uneasy and have not done me the Justice to acquaint me with your Reasons for it  I was in hopes Sir my Reasons might prove to be no Reasons and I would not trouble you with my ungrounded Apprehensions But now Sir we are come directly to the Point and methinks I stand here as  Paul  did before  Felix  and like that poor Prisoner if I Sir reason of  Righteousness Temperance  and  Judgment to come  even to make you as  the great  Felix  did tremble don't put me off  to another Day  to a  more convenient Season  as that Governor did  Paul  for you must bear patiently with all I have to say  Strange uncommon Girl how unaccountable is all this Pr'ythee my Dear and he pulled a Chair by him Come and sit down by me and without these romantick Airs let me hear all you have to say and teize me not with this Parade  No Sir let me stand if you please while I  can  stand when I am weary I will sit down at my Bar  Now Sir as you are so good as to say you have nothing but Change of Temper to accuse me of I am to answer to that and assign a Cause and I will do it without Evasion or Reserve But I beseech you say not one Word but Yes or No to my Questions 'till I have said all I have to say and then you shall find me all Silence and Resignation  Well my strange Dear But sure your Head is a little turn'd What is your Question  Whether Sir the Nun I speak boldly the Case requires itwho followed you at the Masquerade everywhere is not the Countess of  What then my Dear speaking with Quickness I  thought  the Occasion of your Sullenness and Reserve was this But  Pamela    Nay Sir interrupted I only Yes or No if you please I will be all Silence byandby  Yes then  Well Sir then let me  tell  you for I  ask  you not it may be too bold in me to multiply Questions that she  loves  you that you correspond by Letters with her Yes Sir  before  that Letter from her Ladyship came which you receiv'd from my Hand in so short and angry a manner for fear I should have had a Curiosity to see its Contents which would have been inexcusable in me I own if I had You  have talked over to her all your Polygamy Notions and her Ladyship seems so well convinc'd of them that she has declar'd to her noble Uncle who expostulated with her on the Occasions she gave for Talk that she had rather be a certain Gentleman's second Wife than the first to the greatest Man in  England  and you are but just return'd from a Journey to  Tunbridge  in which that Lady was a Party and the Motive for it I am acquainted with by a Letter here in my Hand  He was displeased and frowned I look'd down being resolv'd not to be terrified if I could help it  I have caution'd you  Pamela    I know you have Sir interrupted I but be pleased to answer me Has not the Countess taken a House or Lodgings at  Tunbridge  She has And what then  And is her Ladyship there or in Town  There  And what then  Are you to go to  Tunbridge  Sir soon or not Be pleased to answer me but that one Question  I will know rising up in Anger your Informants  Pamela    Dear Sir so you shall in proper Time you shall know all as soon as I am convinc'd that your Wrath will not be attended with bad Consequences to yourself and others That is wholly the Cause of my Reserve in this Point for I have not a Thought and never had since I have been yours that I wish to be concealed from you But dear Sir your Knowlege of the Informants makes nothing at all as to the Truth of the Information Nor will I press you too home I doubt not you are soon to go down to  Tunbridge  again  I  am  And what then Must the Consequence be Crime enough to warrant your Jealousy  Dear Sir don't be so very angry still looking down for I durst not trust myself to look up I don't do this as you charged me in your Letter in a Spirit of matrimonial Recrimination If you don't  tell  me that you see the Countess with Pleasure I  ask  it not of you nor have I any thing to say by way of Upbraiding 'Tis my Misfortune that she is too lovely and too attractive and it is the less Wonder that a fine young Gentleman as you are and a fine young Lady as she is should engage one another's Affections  I knew all this except what this Letter which you shall read presently communicates when you brought the two noble Sisters to visit me Hence proceeded my Grief and should I Sir have deserv'd to be what I am if I was  not  griev'd Religion has helped me Sir and God has answer'd my Supplications to inable me to act this new and uncommon Part before you at this imaginary Bar You shall see Sir that as on one hand I want not as I said before to move your Passions in my Favour so on the other I shall not be terrified by your Displeasure dreaded by me as it used to be and as it will be again the Moment that my raised Spirits sink down to their usual Level or are diverted from this my long meditated Purpose to tell you all my Mind  I repeat then Sir that I knew all this when the two noble Sisters came to visit your poor Girl and your  Billy  Yet  grave  as the Countess called me dear Sir might I not well be grave knowing what I knew did I betray any Impatience of Speech or Action any Discomposure  No Sir patting my Hand on my Breast  here  all the Discomposure lay struggling vehemently struggling nowandthen and wanting that Vent at my Eyes which it seems overcome by my Joy to  hear myself favourably spoken of by you and the Lady it  too soon  made itself But I could not help itYou might have seen Sir I could not  But I want neither to recriminate nor expostulate nor yet Sir to form Excuses for my general Conduct for that you accuse not in the main But be pleased Sir to read this Letter It was brought by the PenyPost as you'll see by the Mark Who the Writer is I know not And did  you  Sir that Knowlege and your Resentment upon it will not alter the Fact or give it a more favourable Appearance  I stepp'd to him and giving him the Letter came back to my Bar and sat down on one of the Chairs while he read it drying my Eyes for they would overflow as I talked do what I could  He was much moved at the Contents of this Letter Called it dn'd Malice and hoped he might find out the Author of it saying he would advertise Guineas Reward for the Discoverer  He put the Letter in his Pocket Well  Pamela  you believe all that you have said no doubt and this Matter has a black Appearance indeed if you do But who was your  first  Informant Was that by Letter or personally That dn'd  Turner  I doubt not is at the Bottom of all this The vain Coxcomb has had the Insolence to imagine the Countess would favour an Address of his and is inraged to meet with a Repulse and has taken Liberties upon it that have given Birth to all the Scandals which have been scatter'd about on this Occasion Nor do I doubt but he has been the Serpent at the Ear of my  Eve    I stood up at my Bar and said Don't be too hasty Sir in your JudgmentYou  may  be mistaken  But  am  I mistaken  Pamela  You never yet told me an Untruth in Cases the most arduous  Am  I mistaken  Dear Sir if I should tell you it is  not  Mr  Turner  you'll guess at somebody else And what avails all this to the Matter in Hand You are your own Master and must stand and fall by your own Conscience God grant that  that  may acquit you But my Intention is not either to accuse or upbraid you  But my Dear to the Fact then This is a malicious and a villainous Piece of Intelligence given you perhaps for the sake of Designs and Views that may not yet be proper to be avow'd  By God's Grace Sir I defy all Designs and Views of any one upon my Honour  But my Dear the Charge is basely false We have not agreed upon any such way of Life  Well Sir all this only proves that the Intelligence may be a little premature But now let me Sir sit down one Minute or two to recover my failing Spirits and then I'll tell you all I purpose to do and all I have to say and that with as much Brevity as I can for fear neither my Head nor my Heart should perform the Parts I have been so long endeavouring to prevail upon them to perform  I sat down then he taking the Letter out of his Pocket and looking upon it again with much Vexation and Anger in his Countenance and after a few Tears and Sobs that would needs be so officious as to offer their Service unbidden and undesired to introduce what I had to say I rose up my Feet trembling as well as my Knees which however leaning against the Seats of the Chairs which made my Bar as my Hand held by the Back tolerably supported me I cleared my Voice wiped my Eyes and said  You have all the Excuses dear Mr  B  that a Gentleman can have in the Object of your present Passion  Present Passion  Pamela  Dear Sir hear me out without Interruption  The Countess is a charming Lady She excels your poor Girl in all those outward Graces of Form that your kind Fancy more valu'd by me than the Opinion of all the World besides had made you attribute to me And she has all those additional Advantages as Nobleness of Birth of Alliance and Deportment which I want Happy for you Sir that you had known her Ladyship some Months ago before you disgrac'd yourself by the Honours you have done me This therefore frees you from the aggravated Crime of those who prefer to their own Ladies less amiable and less deserving Persons and I have not the Sting that these must have who are contemn'd and illtreated for their Inferiors Yet cannot the Countess love you better than your Girl not even for your Person which must I doubt be  her  principal Attachment when I can truly say all noble and attracting to the outward Eye as you are that is the least Consideration by far with me No Sir it is your Mind your generous and beneficent Mind that is the principal Object of my Affection and the Pride I took in hoping that I might be an humble Means in the Hands of Providence to bless you  hereafter  as well as  here  gave me more Joy than all the Blessings I reaped from your Name or your Fortune Judge then my dearest Mr  B  what my Grief and my Disappointment must be  But I will not expostulate I  will not  because it must be to no Purpose for could my Fondness for you and my watchful Duty to you have kept you steady I should not now have appear'd before you in this solemn manner and I know the Charms of my Rivaless are too powerful for me to contend with Nothing but Divine Grace can touch your  Heart and that I expect not from the Nature of the Case should be instantaneous  I will therefore Sir dear as you are to me don't look with such tender Surprize upon me give up your Person to my happier to my  worthier  Rivaless For since such is your Will and such seem to be your Ingagements what avails it me to oppose them  I have only to beg therefore that you will be so good as to permit me to go down to  Kent  to my dear Parents who with many more are daily rejoicing in your Favour and Bounty  I will there holding up my folded Hands pray for you every Hour of my Life and for every one who shall be dear to you not excepting your charming Countess  I will never take your Name into my Lips nor suffer any other in my Hearing but with Reverence and Gratitude for the Good I and mine  have  reap'd at your Hands nor will I wish to be freed from my Obligations to you except you shall chuse to be divorced from me and if you should I will give your Wishes all the Forwardness that I honourably can with regard to my own Character and yours and that of my beloved Baby  But you must give me something worth living for along with me your  Billy  and mine Unless it is your Desire to kill me quite and then 'tis done and nothing will stand in your happy Countess's Way if you tear from my Arms my  second  earthly Good after I am depriv'd of You my  first    I will there Sir dedicate all my Time to my first Duties happier far than once I could have hoped to be And if by any Accident any Misunderstanding between you you should part by Consent and you will have it so my Heart will be ever yours and my Hopes will be resum'd of being an  Instrument still for your future Good and I will receive your returning ever valu'd Heart as if nothing had happen'd the Moment I can be sure it will be wholly mine  For think not dear Sir whatever be your Notions of Polygamy that I will were my Life to depend upon it consent to live with a Gentleman dear as God is my Witness lifting up my tearful Eyes you are to me who lives in what I cannot but think open Sin with another You  know  Sir and I appeal to you for the Purity and I will aver Piety of my Motives when I say this that I  would not  and as you do know this I cannot doubt but my Proposal will be agreeable to you both And I beg of you dear Sir to take me at my Word and don't let me be tortur'd as I have been so many Weeks with such Anguish of Mind that nothing but religious Considerations can make supportable to me  And are you in Earnest  Pamela  said the dear Gentleman coming to me and folding me in his Arms over the Chair's Back the Seat of which supported my trembling Knees Can you so easily part with me  I can Sir and I will rather than divide my Interest in you knowingly with any Lady on Earth But say not however Can I part with you Sir it is you that part with me And tell me Sir tell me but what you had intended should become of me  You talk to me my dearest Life as if all you had heard against me was true and you would have me answer you would you as if it was  I want nothing to convince me Sir that the Countess loves you You know the rest of my Information Judge for me what I can what I ought to believe You know the Rumours of the World concerning you Even I who stay so much at home and have not taken the least Pains to find  out my Wretchedness nor to confirm it since I knew it have come to the Hearing of it and if you know the License taken with both your Characters and yet correspond so openly must it not look to me that you value not your Honour in the World's Eye nor my Lady hers I told you Sir the Answer she made to her Uncle  You told me my Dear as you were told Be tender of a Lady's Reputation for your own sake No one is exempted from Calumny and even Words said and the Occasion of saying them not known may bear a very different Construction from what they would have done had the Occasion been told  This may be all true Sir I wish my Lady would be as tender of her Reputation as I would be let her injure me in your Affections as she will But can you say Sir that there is nothing between you that should  not  be according to  my  Notions of Virtue and Honour and according to your  own  Sir which I took Pride in before that fatal Masquerade  You answer me not continu'd I and may I not fairly presume you are not able to answer me as I wish to be answer'd But come dearest Sir and I put my Arms round his Neck let me not urge you too boldly I will never forget your Benefits and your past Kindness to me I have been a happy Creature no one till within these few Weeks was ever so happy as I I will love you still with a Passion as ardent as ever I loved you Absence cannot lessen such a Love as mine I am sure it cannot  I see your Difficulties You have gone too far to recede If you can make it easy to your Conscience I will wait with Patience my happier Destiny and I will wish to live if I can be convinc'd  you wish me not to die in order to pray for you and to be a Directress to the first Education of my dearest Baby  You sigh dear Sir repose your beloved Face next to my fond Heart 'Tis all your own And ever shall be let it be worthy of the Honour in your Estimation or not  But yet my dear Sir if one could as easily in the Prime of sensual Youth look Twenty Years forward as one can Twenty Years backward what an empty Vanity what a mere Nothing will be all those grosser Satisfactions that now give Wings of Desire to our debased Appetites  Motives of Religion  will  have their due Force upon  your  Mind one Day I hope as blessed be God they have inabled  me  to talk to you on such a touching Point after infinite Struggles I own with so much Temper and Resignation and then my dearest Mr  B  when we come to that last Bed from which the Pie  y of our Friends shall lift us but from which we shall never be able to raise ourselves for dear Sir your Countess and you and your poor  Pamela  must all come to this we shall find what it is will give us the true Joy and inable us to support the Pangs of the dying HourThink you my dearest Sir and I pressed my Lips to his Forehead as his Head was reclin'd on my throbbing Bosom that  then  in that important Moment what now gives us so much Pleasure will have any Part in our Consideration but as it may give us Woe or Comfort in the Reflection  But I will not I will not O best Beloved of my Soul thus afflict youWhy should I thus sadden all your gaudy Prospects I have said enough to such a Heart as yours if Divine Grace touches it And if not all I can say will be of no AvailI will leave you therefore to That and to your own  Reflections And after giving you ten thousand Thanks for your kind your indulgent Patience with me I will only beg that I may set out in a Week for  Kent  with my dear  Billy  that you will receive one Letter from me at least of Gratitude and Blessings it shall not be of Upbraidings and Exclamations  But my Child you must not deny me for I shall haunt like his Shadow every Place wherein you shall put my  Billy  if you should be so unkind to deny him to meAnd if moreover you will permit me to have the dear Miss  Goodwin  with me as you had almost given me room to hope I will read over all the Books of Education and digest them as well as I am able in order to send you my Scheme and to shew you how fit I hope your  Indulgence  at least will make you think me of having two such precious Trusts reposed in me  I was silent waiting in Tears his Answer But his generous Heart was touch'd and seem'd to labour within him for Expression  He came round to me at last and took me in his Arms Exalted Generosity said he Nobleminded  Pamela  Let no Bar be put between us henceforth No Wonder when one looks back to thy first promising Dawn of Excellence that thy fuller Day should thus irresistibly dazzle such weak Eyes as mine Whatever it costs me and I have been inconsiderately led on by blind Passion for an Object too charming but which I never thought equal to my  Pamela  I will for it is yet I bless God in my Power restore to your Virtue an Husband all your own  Oh Sir Sir and I should have sunk down with Joy had not his kind Arms supported me what have you saidCan I be so happy as to behold you innocent as to Deed God of his infinite Goodness continue you both soAnd Oh that the dear Lady would make me as truly love her for the  Graces of her Mind as I admire her for the Advantages of her Person  You are Virtue itself my dearest Life and from this Moment I will reverence you as my tutelary Angel I shall behold you with Awe and implicitly give up myself to all your Dictates for what you  say  and what you  do  must be ever rightBut I will not my dearest Life too lavishly promise lest you should think it the sudden Effect of Passions thus movingly touch'd and which may subside again when the Soul as you observ'd in your own Case sinks to its former Level But this I promise you and I hope you believe me and will pardon the Pain I have given you which made me fear more than once that your dear Head was affected so uncommon yet so like yourself has been the manner of your Acting that I will break off a Correspondence that has given you so much Uneasiness And my  Pamela  may believe that if I can be as good as my Word in this Point she will never more be in Danger of any Rivaless whatever  But say my dear Love added the charming charming Man say you forgive me and resume but your former Chearfulness and affectionate Regards to me else I shall suspect the Sincerity of your Forgiveness And you shall indeed go to  Kent  but not without me nor your Boy neither and if you insist upon it the poor Miss you have wish'd so often and so generously to have shall be given up absolutely to your Disposal  Do you think my Lady I could speak any one distinct Sentence No indeed I could notPardon Pardon  You  dear Sirand I sunk down on my Knees from his ArmsAll I begAll I hope  Your  Pardon  my  ThankfulnessO spare me spare me but WordsAnd indeed I was just choak'd with my Joy I never was so in my whole  Life before And my Eyes were fixed as the dear Gentleman told me for he was a little startled seeing nothing but the Whites for the Sight was out of its Orbits in a manner lifted up to Heaven in Ecstasy for a Turn so unexpected  We were forced to separate soon after for there was no bearing each other so excessive was my Joy and his Goodnesss He left me and went down to his own Closet  Judge my Imployment you will I am sure my dear Lady I had new Ecstasy to be blest with in a Joy and Thankfulness so exalted that they left me all light and pleasant as if I had shook off Body and trod in Air so much Heaviness had I lost and so much Joy had I received From two such Extremes how was it possible I could presently hit the MediumFor when I had given up my beloved Husband as lost to me and had dreaded the Consequences to his future State to find him not only untainted as to Deed but in all Probability mine upon better and surer Terms than everO Madam is not this a Joy beyond all Joy and surpassing all Expression  About Eight o'Clock my dear Mr  B  sent me up these Lines from his Closet which will explain what I meant as to the Papers I must beg your Ladyship to return me  My dear  PAMELA  "I HAVE so much real Concern at the Anguish I have given you and am so much affected with the Recollection of the uncommon Scenes

Life  "Ever faithfully Yours"  Thus I hope is happily ended this dreadful Affair My next shall inform your Ladyship of the Particulars of our Breakfast Conversation But I would not slip this Post without acquainting you with this blessed Turn and to beg the Favour to send me back my Letters which will lay a new Obligation upon  Dear Madam  Your obliged Sister and humble Servant  P B  LETTER XXXVI  My dearest Lady  YOUR joyful Correspondent has obtained Leave to get every thing ready to quit  London  by  Friday  next when your kind' Brother promises to  carry me down to  Kent  and allows me to take my Charmer with me There's Happiness for you Madam To see as I hope I shall see upon one blessed Spot a dear faithful Husband a beloved Child and a Father and Mother whom I so much love and honour  Mr  B  told me this voluntarily this Morning at Breakfast and then in the kindest manner he took Leave of me and set out for  Bedfordshire    But I should according to my Promise give your Ladyship a few Particulars of our Breakfast Conference  I bid  Polly  withdraw when her Master came up to Breakfast and I ran to the Door to meet him and threw myself on my Knees O forgive me dearest dear Sir all my Boldness of Yesterday My Heart was strangely affectedor I could not have acted as I did But never fear my dearest Mr  B  that my future Conduct shall be different from what it used to be or that I shall keep up to a Spirit that you hardly thought had Place in the Heart of your dutiful  Pamela  till she was thus severely try'd  I have weigh'd well your Conduct my dear Life said the generous Gentleman raising me to his Bosom and I find an Uniformity in it that is surprisingly just  There is in your Composition indeed the strangest Mixture of Meekness and high Spirit that ever I met with Never was a saucier dear Girl than you in your Maiden Days when you thought your Honour in Danger Never a more condescending Goodness when your Fears were at an End Now again when you had Reason as you believ'd to apprehend a Conduct in me unworthy  of my Obligations to you and of your Purity you rise in your Spirit with a Dignity that becomes an injured Person and yet you forget not in the Height of your Resentments that angelick Sweetness of Temper and Readiness to forgive which so well become a Lady who lives as you live and practises what you practise My dearest  Pamela  I see continued he serves not GOD for nought In a better Sense I speak it than the Maligner spoke it of  Job  Since in every Action and Motion of yours the heavenly Direction you so constantly invoke shews itself thus beautifully  And now again this charming Condescension the Moment you are made easy is an Assurance that your affectionate Sweetness is return'd And I cannot fear any thing but that I shall never be able to deserve it  He led me to the TeaTable and sat down close by me  Polly  came in If every thing said he be here that your Lady wants you may withdraw and let Mr  Colbrand  and  Abraham  know I shall be with them presently Nobody shall wait upon me but you my Dear  Polly  withdrew  You are all Goodness Sir And how generously how kindly do you account for that Mixture in my Temper you speak ofDepend upon it dear Sir that I will never grow upon this your Indulgence  I always  lov'd  you my Dearest said he and that with a passionate Fondness which has not I dare say many Examples in the marry'd Life But I revere you now And so great is my Reverence for your Virtue that I chose to sit up all Night as now to leave you for a few Days until by disingaging myself from all Intercourses that have given  you Uneasiness I can convince you that I have render'd myself as worthy as I can be of such an Angel even upon your own Terms I will account to you continued he for every Step I  shall  take and will reveal to you every Step I  have  taken For this I can do because the Lady's Honour is untainted and wicked Rumour has treated her worse than she could deserve  I told him that since  he  had been pleased to name my Lady I would take the Liberty to say I was glad for her own sake to hear that He changing the Subject a little precipitately as if it gave him Pain told me as above that I might prepare on  Friday  for  Kent  and I parted with him with greater Joy and Gratitude than ever I did in my Life So necessary sometimes are Afflictions not only to teach one how to subdue one's Passions and to make us in our happiest States know we are still on Earth but even when they are everblown to augment and redouble our Joys  I am now giving Orders my dear Lady for my beloved Journey and quitting this undelightful Town as it has been and is to me My next will be from  Kent  I hope and perhaps I shall then have an Opportunity to acquaint your Ladyship with the Particulars and if GOD answers my Prayers the Conclusion of the Affair which has given me so much Uneasiness Mean time I am with the greatest Gratitude for the kind Share you have taken in my past Afflictions my good Lady  Your Ladyship's Most obliged Sister and Servant  P B  LETTER XXXVII  My dearest  PAMELA  INclosed are all the Letters you send for I rejoice with you upon the Turn this afflicting Affair has taken thro' your inimitable Prudence and a Courage I thought not in youA Wretchto give you so much DiscomposureBut I will not if he be good now rave against him as I was going to doI am impatient to hear what Account he gives of the Matter I hope he will be able to abandon thisI wont call her Names for she loves the Wretch and that if he be just to  you  will be her Punishment  What Care ought these young Widows to take of their ReputationAnd how watchful ought they to be over themselvesShe was hardly out of her Weeds and yet must go to a Masquerade and tempt her Fate with all her Passions about her with an Independence and an Affluence of Fortune that made her able to think of nothing but gratifying them  Then her Lord and she had been marry'd but barely Two Years and one of them she was forc'd with the gayest Temper in the World to be his Nurse For always inclin'd to a consumptive Indisposition he languish'd without Hope a Twelvemonth and then dy'd  She has good Qualitiesis generousnoblebut has strong Passions and is thoughtless and precipitant  My Lord came home to me last  Tuesday  with a long Story of my Brother and her for I had kept the Matter as secret as I could for his sake and  yours It seems he had it from Sir  John  Uncle to the young Lord  C  who is very earnest to bring on a Treaty of Marriage between her and his Nephew who is in Love with her and is a fine young Gentleman but has held back on the Liberties she has lately given herself with my Brother I hope she is innocent as to Fact but I know not what to say to it He ought to be hang'd if he did not say she was Yet I have a great Opinion of his Veracity And yet he is so bold a WretchAnd her Inconsideration is so great  But lest I should alarm your Fears I will wait till I have the Account he gives you of this dark Affair till when I congratulate you upon the Leave you have obtain'd to quit the Town and on your setting out for a Place so much nearer to  Tunbriige  forgive me  Pamela  but he is an intriguing Wretch and I would not have you to be too secure lest the Disappointment should be worse for you than what you knew before For assure yourself that I am in all Cases and Events  Your affectionate Sister and Almirer  B DAVERS  P S Your  Bar  and some other Parts of your Conduct in your Trial as you call it make me as by your Account it seemed to do him apprehensive that you would hardly have been able to have kept your Intellect so untouched as were to be wish'd had this Affair proceeded And this as it would have been the most deplorable Misfortune that could have befallen us who love and admire you so justly redoubles my Joy that it is likely to end so happily GOD send it may  LETTER XXXVIII From Mrs  B  to Lady  DAVERS    My dearest Lady  MR  B  with great Goodness came back from  Bedfordshire  to his Time Every thing being in Readiness we set out my Baby and his Nurse and  Polly  and  Rachel  in the Coach Mr  B  and myself in the Chariot The other Maids are to go down with Mrs  Jervis  when every thing in  London  is settled by her Direction to  Bedfordshire  and all the Menservants too except Mr  Jonathan  and  Abraham  and  John  who went down with us on Horseback as also did Mr  Colbrand    We were met by my Father and Mother in a Chaise and Pair that your dear Brother had unknown to me presented to them that they might often take the Air together and go to Church in it which is at some Distance from them on  Sundays  The Driver is cloathed in a good brown Cloth Suit but no Livery for that my Parents could not have borne as Mr  B  's Goodness made him consider  Your Ladyship must needs think how much we were all overjoy'd at this Meeting For my own Part I cannot express how much I was transported when we arrived at the Farmhouse to see all I delighted in upon one happy Spot together  Mr  B  is much pleased with the Alterations made here  See  Vol III  Letter  I  and it is a sweet rural and convenient Place  We were at Church together on  Sunday  and welcom'd into these Parts by the Bells and by the Minister and the People of most Note  Mr  B  is to set out on  Tuesday  for  Tunbridge  with my Papers A happy Issue attend that Affair I pray GOD He has given me the following Particulars of it to the Time of my Trial beginning at the Masquerade  He says That at the Masquerade when pleased with the fair Nun's Shape Air and Voice he had followed her to a Corner most unobserved she said in  Italian  Why are my Retirements invaded audacious  Spaniard  Because reply'd he my dear Nun I hope you would have it so  I can no otherwise return'd she strike dead thy bold Presumption than to shew thee my Scorn and Anger thusAnd unmasking she surpris'd me said Mr  B  with a Face as beautiful but not so soft as my  Pamela  'sAnd I said Mr  B  to shew I can defy your Resentment will shew you a Countenance as intrepid as yours is lovely And so he drew aside his Mask too  He says he observed his fair Nun followed whereever she went by a Mask habited like  Testimony  in  Sir Courtly Nice  whose Attention was fixed upon them and he doubted not that it was Mr  Turner  So he and the fair Nun took different Ways and he joined me and Miss  Darnford  and found me ingag'd in the manner I related to your Ladyship and his Nun at his Elbow unexpected  That afterwards as he was ingag'd in  French  with a Lady who had the Dress of an  Indian  Princess and the Mask of an  Ethiopian  his fair Nun  said in broken  Spanish  Art thou at all ComplectionsBy St  Ignatius  I believe thou'rt a Rover  I am trying reply'd he in  Italian  whether I can meet with any Lady comparable to my lovely Nun  And what is the Result  Not one no not one  I wish you could not help being in Earnest said she and slid from him  He ingag'd her next at the Sideboard drinking under her Veil a Glass of Champaign You know  Pamela  said he there never was a sweeter Mouth in the World than the Countess's except your own She drew away the Glass as if unobserved by any body to shew me the lower Part of her Face  I cannot say continued he but I was struck with her charming Manner and an Unreservedness of Air and Behaviour that I had not before seen so becomingThe Place and the Freedom of Conversation and Deportment allowed there gave her Manner great Advantages in my Eye altho' her Habit requir'd as I thought continued he a little more Gravity and Circumspection And I could not tell how to resist a secret Pride and Vanity which is but too natural to both Sexes when they are taken notice of by Persons so worthy of Regard  Naturally fond of any thing that carry'd the Face of an Intrigue I long'd to know proceeded he who this charming Nun wasAnd next Time I ingag'd her My good Sister said I how happy should I be if I might be admitted to a Conversation with you at your Grate  Answer me thou bold  Spaniard  for that was a Name she seem'd fond to call me by said he which  gave me to imagine that Boldness was a Qualification with which she was not displeased 'Tis not unusual with our vain Sex observed he to construe even Reproaches to our Advantage Is the Lady here whose Shackles thou wearest  Do I look like a Man shackled my fairest Nun  NNo not much like such an one But I fansy thy Wife is either a  Widow  or a  Quaker    Neither reply'd I taking by Equivocation her Question literally  And art thou not a marry'd Wretch Answer me quicklyWe are observ'd  Nosaid I  Swear to me thou art not  By St  Ignatius  then For my Dear I was no  Wretch  you know  Enough said sheand slid away and the Fanatick would fain have ingag'd her but she avoided him as industriously  Before I was aware continued Mr  B  she was at my Elbow and in  Italian  said That fair Quaker yonder is the Wit of the Assemblée Her Eyes seem always directed to thy Motions And her Person shews some Intimacies have passed with somebody It is with thee  It would be my Glory if it was said I were her Face answerable to her Person  Is it not  I long to know reply'd Mr  B  I am glad thou dost not  I am glad to hear my fair Nun say that  Dost thou said she hate Shackles Or is it that thy Hour is not come  I wish reply'd he this be not the Hour the very Hourpretending naughty Gentleman What Ways these Men have to sigh  She went again to the Sideboard put her Hand kerchief upon it Mr  B  followed her and observed all her Motions She drank a Glass of Lemonade as he of Burgundy and a Person in a Domine who was supposed to be the King taking every one's Attention and Mr  B  eying her Handkerchief which he doubted not she laid on purpose to forget taking up she left it there and slipping by him he unobserv'd as he believes took it and put it in his Pocket and at one Corner found the Cover of a Letter To the Right Honourable the Countess Dowager of  That after this the fair Nun was so shy so reserv'd and seem'd so studiously to avoid him that he had no Opportunity to return her Handkerchief and the Fanatick observing how she shunned him said in  French  What Monsieur have you done to your Nun  Found her to be a very Coquet and told her so and she is offended  How could you affront a Lady reply'd he with such a  charming Face  By that I had Reason to think said Mr  B  that he had seen her unmask and I saidIt becomes not any Character but that you wear to pry into the Secrets of others in order to make illnatur'd Remarks and perhaps to take ungentlemanly Advantages  No Man would make that Observation return'd he whose Views would bear prying into  I was nettled said Mr  B  at this warm Retort and drew aside my Mask Nor would any Man who wore not a Mask tell me so  He took not the Challenge and slid from me and I saw him no more that Night  So thinks I another Instance this might have been of the glorious Consequences of Masquerading O my Lady these Masquerades are abominable Things  The King they said met with a free Speaker that Night In Truth I was not very sorry for it for if Monarchs will lay aside their sovereign Distinctions and mingle thus in Masquerade with the worst as well as the highest I cannot say  best  of their Subjects let 'em take the ConsequencePerhaps they might have a Chance to hear more Truth here than in their Palacesthe only Good that possibly can accrue from themthat is to sayIf they made a good Use of it when they heard it For you see my Monarch tho' told the Truth as it happened received the Hint with more Resentment than ThankfulnessSo 'tis too likely did the Monarch of us both  And now my Lady you need not doubt that so polite a Gentleman would find an Opportunity to return the Nun her HandkerchiefTo be sure he would For what Man of Honour would rob a Lady of any Part of her Apparel And should he that wanted to steal a Heart content himself with a HandkerchiefNo no that was not to be expectedSo what does he do but the very next Day after Dinner the soonest Opportunity he could well take because of the late Hours the Night before resolve to pursue this Affair Accordingly the poor Quaker little thinking of the Matter away goes her naughty  Spaniard  to find out his Nun at her Grate or in her Parlour rather  He asks for the Countess Is admitted into the outward ParlourHer Woman comes down requires his Name and Business His Name he mentioned not His Business was to restore into her  Lady's own Hands something she had dropt the Night beforeWas desir'd to wait  I should have told your Ladyship that he was dress'd very richlyhaving no Design at all to make Conquests no not heO this wicked Love of IntrigueA kind of Olivecolour'd Velvet and fine brocaded Waistcoat I said when he took Leave of me You're a charming Mr  B  and saluted him more pressingly than he return'd it but little did I think when I plaited so smooth his richlac'd Ruffles and Bosom where he was going or what he had in his plotting HeartHe went in his own Chariot that he did So that he had no Design to conceal who he wasBut Intrigue a new Conquest Vanity PrideO these MenThey had need talk of LadiesBut it is half our own Fault indeed it is to incourage their Vanity  Well Madam he waited till his Stateliness was moved to send up again That he would wait on her Ladyship some other TimeSo down she came dress'd most richly Jewels in her Breast and in her Hair and EarsBut with a very reserved and stately AirHe approached herMethinks I see him dear saucy Gentleman You know Madam what a noble manner of Address he has  He took the Handkerchief from his Bosom with an Air and kissing it presented it to her saying This happy Estray thus restor'd begs Leave by me to acknowlege its lovely Owner  What mean you SirWho be you Sir What mean you  Your Ladyship will excuse me But I am incapable of meaning any thing but what is honourable No to be sureThis Madam you left last Night when the Domine took up every one's Attention  but mine which was much better ingag'd and I take the Liberty to restore it to you  She turn'd to the Mark a Coronet at one Corner 'Tis true Sir I see now it is one of mine But such a Trifle was not worthy of being brought by such a Gentleman as you seem to be nor of my Trouble to receive it in Person Your Servant Sir might have delivered the Bagatelle to mine  Nothing should be called so that belongs to the Countess of  She was no Countess Sir that  dropt  that Handkerchief and a Gentleman would not attempt to penetrate  unbecomingly  thro' the Disguises that a Lady thinks proper to assume especially at such a Place where every Inquiry should begin and end  This Madam from a Lady who had unmasked because  she would not be known  Very pretty indeedOh these slight Cobweb Airs of Modesty so easily seen thro'Hence such Advantages against us are taken by the Men  She had looked out of her Window and seen no Arms quartered with his own for you know my Lady I would never permit any to be procured for me So she doubted not it seems but he was an unmarried Gentleman as he had intimated to her the Night before  He told her it was impossible after having had the Opportunity of seeing the finest Lady in the World not to wish to see her again and that he hop'd he did not  unbecomingly  break thro' her Ladyship's Reserves Nor had he made any Inquiries either on the Spot or off of it having had a much better Direction by Accident  As how Sir said she as he told me with so bewitching an Air between Attentive and Pleasant that bold Gentleman forgetting all manner of Distance  so early too he clasped his Arms round her Waist and saluted her struggling with Anger and Indignation he says But I think little of that  Whence this InsolenceHownow SirBegone were her Words and she rung the Bell but he set his Back against the DoorI never heard such Boldness in my Life Madamtill she would forgive himAnd it is plain she was not so angry as she pretended for her Woman coming she was calmer  Nelthorpe  said she fetch my Snuffbox with the Lavender in it  Her Woman went and then she said You told me Sir last Night of your Intrepidness I think you are the boldest Man I ever met with But Sir surely you ought to know that you are not now in the  Haymarket    I think truly Madam the Lady might have sav'd herself that Speech for upon my Word they neither of 'em wore MasksTho' they ought both to have put on one of BlushesI am sure I do for 'em while I am writing  Her irresistible Loveliness served for an Excuse that she could not disapprove from a Man she disliked not and his irresistiblemay I say Assurance Madamfound too ready an Excuse  Well but Sir said I pray when her Ladyship was made acquainted that you were a marry'd Gentleman how thenI long to hear how then Pray did  she  find it out or did  you  tell her  Patience my Dear  Well pray Sir go onWhat was next  Why next I put on a more respectful and tender Air I would have taken her Hand indeed but she would not permit it and when she saw I would not go till her Lavender Snuff came down for so I told her and her Woman was not in Haste she  seated herself and I took my Place by her and began upon a Subject of a charming Lady I saw the Night before after I had parted with her Ladyship but not equal by any means to her And I was confident this would ingage her Attention for I never knew the Lady who thought herself handsome that was not taken by this Topick Flattery and Admiration  Pamela  are the two principal Engines by which our Sex make their first Approaches to yours and if you listen to us we are sure either by the Sap or the Mine to succeed and blow you up whenever we please if we do but take care to suit ourselves to your particular Foibles or to carry on the Metaphor point our Batteries to your weak Side For the strongest Fortresses my Dear are weaker in one Place than anotherA fine thing Sir said I to be so learned a GentlemanI wish tho' you had always come honestly by your Knowlege thought I  When the Lavender Snuff came down continued he we were ingaged in an agreeable Disputation that I had raised on purpose to excite her Opposition she having all the Advantage in it and in order to give it up when she was intent upon it as a Mark of my Consideration for her  I the less wonder Sir said I at your Boldness pardon the Word with such a Lady in your first Visit because of her Freedoms when mask'd her Unmasking and her Handkerchief and Lettercover To be sure the Lady when she saw next Day such a fine Gentleman and such an handsome Equipage had little Reason after her other Freedoms to be so very nice with you as to decline an insnaring Conversation calculated on purpose to ingage her Attention and to lengthen out your Visit But did she not ask you who you were  Her Servants did of mineAnd her Woman for I knew all afterwards when we were better acquainted came and whispered her Lady that I was Mr  B  of  Bedfordshire  and had an immense Estate to which they were so kind as to add two or three thousand Pounds a Year out of pure Goodwill to me I thank them  But pray dear Sir what had you in View in all this Did you intend to carry this Matter at first as far as ever you could  I had at first my Dear no View but such as Pride and Vanity suggested to me I was carried away by Inconsideration and the Love of Intrigue without so much as giving myself any Thought about the Consequences The Lady I observed had abundance of fine Qualities I thought I could converse with her on a very agreeable Foot and her Honour I knew at any Time would preserve me mine if ever I should find it in Danger And in my Soul I preferr'd my  Pamela  to all the Ladies on Earth and questioned not but that and your Virtue would be another Barrier to my Fidelity  As to the Notion of  Polygamy  I never but in the Levity of Speech and the Wantonness of Argument like other lively young Fellows who think they have Wit to shew when they advance something out of the common way had it in my Head I thought myself doubly bound by the Laws of my Country to discourage that way of Thinking as I was a Five hundredth Part of one of the Branches of the Legislature and inconsiderable as that is yet it makes one too considerable in my Opinion to break those Laws one should rather join all one's Interest to inforce  In a Word therefore Pride Vanity Thoughtlessness were my Misguiders as I said The Countess's  Honour and Character and your Virtue and Merit my Dear and my Obligations to you were my Defences But I find one should avoid the first Appearances of Evil One knows not one's own Strength 'Tis presumptuous to depend upon it where Wit and Beauty are in the Way on one Side and Youth and strong Passions on the other  You certainly Sir say right But be pleased to tell me what her Ladyship said when she knew you were marry'd  The Countess's Woman was in my Interest and let me into some of her Lady's Secrets having a great Share in her Confidence and particularly acquainted me how loth her Lady was to believe I was marry'd I had paid her three Visits in Town and attended her once to her Seat upon the Forest before she heard that I was But when she was assured of it and directed her  Nelthorpe  to ask me about it and I readily own'd it she was greatly incensed tho' nothing but general Civilities and Intimacies not inconsistent with honourable Friendship had passed between us The Consequence was she forbid me ever seeing her again and set out with her Sister and the Viscount for  Tunbridge  where she stay'd about three Weeks  I thought I had already gone too far and blamed myself for permitting her Ladyship so long to believe me a single Man and here the Matter had dropp'd in all Probability had not a Ball given by Lord to which unknown to each other we were both as also the Viscountess invited brought us again into one another's Company The Lady withdrew after a while with her Sister to another Apartment and being resolved upon personal Recrimination which is what a Lady who is resolved to break with a favoured Object should never trust herself with  sent for me and reproached me on my Conduct in which her Sister join'd  I own'd frankly that it was rather Gaiety than Design that made me give Cause at the Masquerade for her Ladyship to think I was not marry'd for that I had a Wife who had a thousand Excellencies and was my Pride and my Boast That I held it very possible for a Gentleman and Lady to carry on an innocent and honourable Friendship in a  Family  way and I was sure when she and her Sister saw my Spouse they would not be displeased with her Acquaintance and all that I had to reproach myself with was that after having at the Masquerade given Reason to think I was not marry'd I had been loth  officiously  to say I was altho' it never was my Intention to conceal it  In short I acquitted myself so well to both Ladies that a Family Intimacy was consented to  I renew'd my Visits and we accounted to one another's Honour by entering upon a kind of  Platonick  System in which Sex was to have no manner of Concern  But my dear  Pamela  I must own myself extremely blameable because I knew the World and human Nature I will say better than the Lady who never before had been trusted into it upon her own Feet and who notwithstanding that Wit and Vivacity which every one admires in her gave herself little Time for Consideration as she had met with a Man whose Person and Conversation she did not dislike and whose Circumstances and Spirit set him above sordid or mercenary Views And besides I made myself useful to her in some of her Affairs wherein she had been grosly abused which brought us into more intimate and frequent Conversations than otherwise we should have had Opportunities for  I ought therefore to have more carefully guarded against Inconveniencies that I knew were so likely to arise from such Intimacies and the rather as I hinted because the Lady had no Apprehension at all of any So that my Dear if I have no Excuse from human Frailty from Youth and the Charms of the Object I am intirely destitute of any  I see dear Sir said I there is a great deal to be said for the Lady I wish I could say there was for the Gentleman But such a fine Lady had been safe with all her Inconsideration and so forgive me Sir would the Gentleman with all his intriguing Spirit had it not been for these vile Masquerades Never dear Sir think of going to another  Why my Dear he was pleased to say those are least of all to be trusted at those Diversions who are most desirous to go to themOf this I am now fully convinced  Well dear Sir I long to hear the further Particulars of this Story For this generous Openness now the Affair is over cannot but be grateful to me as it shews me you have no Reserves and as it tends to convince me that the Lady was less blameable than I apprehended she was For dearly do I love for the Honour of my Sex to find Ladies of Birth and Quality innocent who have so many Opportunities of knowing and practising their Duties above what meaner Persons can haveElse what  one  fails in thro' Surprize and Ignorance it will look as if the  others  did from Inclination And what a Disgrace is that upon the Sex in general And what a Triumph to the wicked ones of yours  Well observed my Dear This is like your generous and deep way of Thinking  Well but dear Sir proceed if you please Your Reconciliation is now effected A Friendship  Quadrupartite is commenced And the Viscountess and myself are to find Cement for the erecting of an Edifice that is to be devoted to  Platonick  Love What may I ask came next And what did you design should come of it  The  Oxford  Journey my Dear followed next and it was my Fault that you made not a Party in it For both Ladies were very desirous of your Company But it being about the Time you were going abroad after your Lyingin I excused you to them Yet they both long'd to see you especially as by this Time you may believe they knew all your Story And besides whenever you were mentioned I always did Justice as well to your Mind as your Person and this not only for the Sake of Justice but to say Truth because it gave the two Sisters and the Viscount whose softly Character and his Lady's prudent and respectful Conduct to him notwithstanding that are both so well known less Cause of Suspicion that I had any dishonourable Designs upon the Dowager Lady  Miss  Darnford  will have it permit me my dear Lady to observe that I have some Merit with Regard to the rest of my Sex if I am inabled to reform such a dangerous Spirit of Intrigue as your dear Brother possessed And the History of this Affair from his own Mouth made me begin to pride myself on this Head For was he not think you my Lady in this Case a sad GentlemanAnd how deeply was he able to lay his Mischiefs And how much had this fine Lady been to be pity'd had she fallen by his Arts who was the only Man almost that from the Gracefulness of his Person the Nobleness of his Mind his Generosity Courage ample Fortunes and Wit could have made her unhappy GOD be praised that it was stopt in Time tho'  as it seems but just in Time as well for the poor Lady's sake as for Mr  B  's and my own  Excuse me Madam for this Digression But yet for what I am going to repeat I shall still want further Excuse for I cannot resist a little rising Vanity upon a Comparison tho' only as to Features drawn by your dear Brother between the Countess and me which however the Preference he gives me in it may be undeserved yet it cannot but be very agreeable in this particular Case of a Rivalry to one who takes so much Pride in his good Opinion and who makes it her chief Study by all honest and laudable Means to preserve it but who else I hope is far from considering such a transitory Advantage had I it in as great a Degree as his kind Fancy imputes to me but as it deserves I will give it as near as I can in his own Words  It may not be altogether amiss my Dear now I have mentioned the Justice I always did your Character and Merit to give you a brief Account of a Comparison which once the Countess's Curiosity drew from me between your Features and hers  She and I were alone in the Bowwindow of her Library which commands a fine View over  Windsor  Forest but which View we could not enjoy for it rain'd and blew a Hurricane almost which tho' ready dress'd to go abroad detain'd us within  I began a Subject which never fails to make the worst of Weather agreeable to a fine Lady that of praising her Beauty and the Symmetry of her Features telling her how much I thought every graceful one in her Face adorn'd the rest as if they were all form'd to give and receive Advantage from each other I added approaching her as if the more attentively to peruse her fine Face that I believ'd it  possible from the transparent Whiteness of her Skin and the clear Blueness of her Veins to discover the Circulation without a Microscope  Keep your Distance Mr  B  said she Does your magnifying thus egregiously the Graces you impute to my outward Form agree with your  Platonick  Scheme Your Eye penetrating as you imagine it pierces not deep enough for a  Platonick  if you cannot look farther than the White and the Blue and discover the Circulation of the Spirit for our Friendship is all Mind you know  True Madam but if the Face is the Index of the Mind when I contemplate yours I see and revere the Beauties of both in one And what  Platonick  Laws forbid us to do Justice to the one when we admire the other  Well sit you down bold Mr  B  sit you down and answer me a Question or two on this Subject since you will be always raising my Vanity upon it  I did saluting her Hand  only  That was his Word which I took notice of in the dear  Platonick  tho' I said nothing  Tell me now of a Truth with all the Charms your too agreeable Flattery gives me Which is the most lovely your  Pamela  or myself  I told her you were both inimitable in a different Way  Well said she I give up the Person and Air in general because I have heard that she is slenderer and better shap'd than most Ladies but for a few Particulars as to  Face  invidious as the Camparison may be and concern'd as you are to justify your Choice I'll begin with the  Hair  Mr  B  Whose HAIR is of most Advantage to her Complection Come I fansy I shall at least divide Perfections with your  Pamela    Your Ladyship's delicate light Brown is extremely beautiful and infinitely better becomes your Complection and Features than would that lovely shineing Auburn which suits best with my Girl's  You must know  Pamela  I always called you my Girl to her as I do frequently to yourself and others  So she excels me there I find  I don't say so  Well but as to the FOREHEAD Mr  B  Indeed Madam my Girl has some Advantage I presume to think in her Forehead She has a noble Openness and Freedom there that bespeaks her Mind and every body's Favour the Moment she appears Not but that your Ladyship's next to hers is the finest I ever saw  So  Next  to hers rubbing her ForeheadWell BROWS Mr  B    Your Ladyship's fine ArchBrow is a Beauty in your fair Face that a Pencil cannot imitate but then your fairer Hair shews it not to that Advantage I must needs say that her darker Hair gives her for as to COMPLECTION your are both so charmingly fair that I cannot for my Life give a Preference to either  Well well foolish Man said she peevishly thou art strangely taken with thy GirlI wish thou wouldst go about thy BusinessWhat signifies a little bad Weather to MenBut if her Complection is as good as mine it must look better because of her dark HairI shall come poorly off I findLet's have the EYES however  For black Eyes in my Girl and blue in your Ladyship they are both the loveliest I ever beheld And  Pamela  I was wicked enough to say That it would be the sweetest Travelling in the World  to have you both placed at Fifty Miles Distance from each other and to pass the Prime of one's Life from Black to Blue and from Blue to Black and it would be impossible to know which to prefer but the present  Ah naughty Mr  B  said I were you not worse than the Countess a great deal  The Countess is not bad my Dear I was all in Fault  But what Sir did she say to you  Say why the saucy Lady did what very few Ladies have ever done She made the Powder fly out of my Wig by a smart Cuff with her nimble Fingers  And how Sir did you take that  How my DearWhy I kiss'd her in Revenge  Fine Doings between two  Platonicks  thought I  But I will own to you Madam that my Vanity in this Comparison was too much soothed not to wish to hear how it was carried on  Well Sir did you proceed further in your Comparison  I knew my Dear you would not let me finish at half your PictureO  Pamela  Who says you are absolutely perfect Who says there is no  Sex  in your  Mind  and tapp'd my Neck  All is owing Sir to the Pride I take in your Opinion I care not how indifferent I appear in the Eyes of all the World besides  The CHEEK came next proceeded Mr  B  I allow'd her Ladyship to have a livelier Carmine in hers and that it was somewhat rounder her Ladyship being a little plumper than my Girl but that  your  Face my Dear being rather smaller featur'd of the two there was an inimitably finer Turn in your Cheek than I had ever seen in my Life  Her Ladyship stroked her Cheekbones which however Madam I think are far from being high tho' to be sure she is a little larger featur'd in excellent Proportion for all that as she is of a taller and a larger Make than me and said Very well Sir you are determined to mortify me But added her Ladyship which shewed Madam she little depended upon  Platonicism  in him if you have a  View  in this you will be greatly mistaken I'll assure you For let me tell you Sir the Lady who can think meanly of herself is any Man's Purchace  The NOSE I left in doubt said Mr  B  but allow'd that each were exquisitely beautiful on its own proper Face  Her Ladyship was sure of a Preference in her MOUTH I allow'd that her LIPS were somewhat plumperand saluting her by Surprize for which I had much ado to preserve my Wig from another Disorder a little softer of Consequence but not quite so redfor said I I never saw a Lip of so rich and balmy a Red in my Life as my Girl's  But  your  SMILES Madam are more bewitchingly free and attractive for my Girl is a little too grave  And my Lady charming as your TEETH are I think hers not a whit inferior in Whiteness and Regularity  Her CHIN my Lady is a sweet Addition to her Face by that easy soft half Round that looks as if Nature had begun at Top and gave that as her finishing Stroke to the rest While my dear Lady yours is a little little too strong featur'd but such as so infinitely becomes your Face that my Girl's Chin would not have half the Beauty upon your Face  Her EARS my Lady are just such as your own Must they not be beautiful then Her NECK tho' it must not presumelet me see Madam approaching herKeep your Distance Sir I was forced to do sotho' it must not pretend to excel yours for Whiteness yet except yours did I never see any Neck so beautiful But your Ladyship it must be confess'd being a little plumper in Person has the Advantage  here    I had a smart Rap on my Knuckles with her Fan And she would hear no more But was resolv'd she would see you she said  And my Dear I am the more particular in repeating this comparative Description of the two charming'st Persons in  England  because you will see the Reason and that it was not to insult you as you rightly judg'd in your Letter to my Sister  See p    l    but to your Advantage that I gave way to the Importunity of the Countes to see you for I little thought you were so well acquainted with our Intimacy much less that we had been made more intimate to you than ever in Truth we were or perhaps might have been And when I asked you Why you were not richer dress'd and had not your Jewels you may believe as I had no Reason to doubt that the Countess would come in all her Ornaments I was not willing my Girl should give way to the noble Emulatress in any thing being concern'd for your own Honour as well as mine in the Superiority of Beauty I had so justly given you  Well Sir to be sure this was kind very kind and little was I disposed knowing what I knew to pass so favourable a Construction on your Generosity to me  My Question to her Ladyship continued Mr  B  at going away Whether you was not the charming'st Girl in the World which seeing you together at one View rich as she was drest and plain as you gave me the double Pleasure a Pleasure she said afterwards I exulted in of deciding in your Favour my Readiness to explain to you what we both said and her not ungenerous Answer I thought would have intitled me to a better Return than a Flood of Tears which confirm'd me that your past Uneasiness was a Jealousy I was not willing to allow in you tho' I should have been more indulgent to it had I known the Grounds you thought you had for it And this was the Reason of my leaving you so abruptly as I did  Here Madam Mr  B  broke off referring to another time the Conclusion of his Narrative And having written a great deal I will here also close this Letter tho' possibly I may not send it till I send the Conclusion of this Story in my next with the Assurance that I am  Your Ladyship's obliged Sister and Servant  P B  LETTER XXXIX  My dear Lady  NOW I will proceed with my former Subject and with the greater Pleasure as what follows makes still more in favour of the Countess's Character than what went before altho' that set it in a better Light than it had once appeared to me in I began as follows  Will you be pleased Sir to favour me with the Continuation of our last Subject I will my Dear You left off Sir with acquitting me as knowing what I knew for breaking out into that Flood of Tears which occasioned your abrupt Departure But dear Sir will you be pleased to satisfy me about that affecting Information of your Intention and my Lady's to live at  Tunbridge  together  'Tis absolutely Malice and Falshood Our Intimacy had not proceeded so far and thoughtless as my Sister's Letters suppose the Lady she would have spurn'd at such a Proposition I dare say  Well but then Sir as to the Expression to her Uncle that she had rather have been a certain Gentleman's second Wife  I believe she might say something like it in Passion to him He had been teizing her from the time that I held an Argument in favour of that foolish Topick  Polygamy  in his Company and his Niece's and in that of her Sister and the Viscount with Cautions against conversing with a Man who having as he was pleased to say behind my Back marry'd beneath him wanted to ingage the Affections of a Lady of Birth in order to recover by doubling the Fault upon her the Reputation he had lost  She despis'd his Insinuation enough to answer him That she thought my Arguments in Behalf of  Polygamy  were convincing This set him a raving and he threw some coarse Reflections upon her which could not be repeated if one may guess at them by her being incapable to tell me what they were and then to vex him more and to revenge herself she said something like what was reported And this was Handle enough for her Uncle who took care to propagate it with an Indiscretion  peculiar to himself for I heard of it in three different Companies before I knew any thing of it from herself and when I did it was so repeated as you my Dear would hardly have censur'd her for it the Provocation consider'd  Well but then dear Sir there is nothing at all amiss at this Rate in the Correspondence between my Lady and you  Not on her Side I dare say if her Ladyship can be excused to Punctilio and for having a greater Esteem for a married Man than he can deserve or than may be strictly defended to a Person of your Purity and Niceness  Well Sir this is very noble in you I love to hear the Gentlemen generous in Points where the Honour of our Sex is concern'd  But pray Sir what then was there on  your  Side in that Matter that made you give me so patient and so kind a Hearing  Now my Dear you come to the Point At first it was as I have said before nothing in me but Vanity Pride and Love of Intrigue to try my Strength where I had met with some Encouragement as I thought at the Masquerade where the Lady went further too than she would have done had she not thought I was a single Man For by what I have told you  Pamela  you will observe that she endeavour'd to satisfy herself on that Head as soon as she well could Mrs  Nelthorpe  acquainted me afterwards when we were better known to one another That her Lady was so partial in my Favour Who can always govern their Fancies my Dear as to think so early as at the Masquerade that if every thing answer'd Appearances and that I were a single Man she who has a noble and independent Fortune might possibly  be induc'd to make me happy in her Choice  Supposing then that I was unmarry'd she left a Signal for me in her Handkerchief I visited her had the Honour after the customary first Shyness of being well receiv'd by her and continued my Visits till perhaps she would have been glad I had not been marry'd But when she found I was she avoided me as I have told you till the Accident I mention'd threw us again upon one another which renew'd our Intimacy upon Terms perhaps too inconsiderate on one Side and too designing on the other  For myself what can I say Only that you without Cause as I thought gave me great Disgusts by your unwonted Reception of me Ever in Tears and Grief the Countess ever chearful and lively And apprehending that your Temper was intirely changing I believ'd I had no bad Excuse to make myself easy and chearful abroad since my Home became more irksome to me than ever I believ'd it could be Then as we naturally love those who love us I had Vanity and some Reason for my Vanity indeed all vain Men believe they haveto think the Countess had more than an Indifference for me She was so exasperated by the wrong Methods taken with an independent Lady of her generous Spirit to break off the Acquaintance with me that in Revenge she deny'd me less than ever Opportunities of her Company The Pleasure we took in each other's Conversation was reciprocal The World's Reports had united us in one common Cause and you as I said had made Home less delightful to me than it us'd to be What might not then have been apprehended from  so many Circumstances concurring with the Lady's Beauty and my Frailty  I waited on her to Tunbridge She took an House there Where Peoples Tongues will take so much Liberty when they have no Foundation for it at all and where the utmost Circumspection is us'd what will they not say where so little of the latter is aim'd at No wonder then that Terms were said to be agreed upon between us From her Uncle's Story of  Polygamy  propos'd by me and agreed to by her no wonder that all your  ThomasineFuller  's Information was surmised  And thus stood the Matter when I was determin'd to give your Cause for Uneasiness a fair Hearing and to take my Measures according to what should result from that Hearing  From this Account dear Sir said I it will not be so difficult as I was afraid it would be to end this Affair even to her  Ladyship  's Satisfaction  I hope not my Dear  But if now Sir the Countess should still be desirous not to break with you from so charming a Lady who knows what may happen  Very true  Pamela  But to make you still easier I will tell you That her Ladyship has a first Cousin marry'd to a Person with a publick Character to several of the  Italian  Courts and had it not been for my Persuasions she would have accepted of their earnest Invitations and pass'd a Year or two in  Italy  where she once resided for three Years together which makes her so perfect a Mistress of  Italian    Now I will let her know additional to what I have written to her the Uneasiness I have given you and so far as it is proper what is come to your Ears and your generous Account of her and  the Charms of her Person of which she will not be a little proud for she has really noble and generous Sentiments and thinks well tho' her Sister in Pleasantry will have it a little enviously of you And when I shall endeavour to persuade her to go for the sake of her own Character to a Place and Country of which she was always fond I am apt to think she will come into it for she has a greater Opinion of my Judgment than it deserves And I know a young Lord that may be easily persuaded to follow her thither and bring her back his Lady if he can obtain her Consent And what say you  Pamela  to this  O Sir I believe I shall begin to love the Lady dearly and that is what I never thought I should I hope this will be brought about  But I see give me Leave to say Sir how dangerously you might have gone on both you and my Lady under the Notion of this  Platonick  Love till two precious Souls might have been lost And this shews one as well in Spirituals as Temporals from what slight Beginnings the greatest Mischiefs sometimes spring and how easy at first a Breach may be stopp'd that when neglected the Waves of Passion will improve and bear down all before them  Your Observation my Dear is just reply'd he and tho' I am confident the Lady was more in Earnest than myself in the Notion of  Platonick  Love yet am I convinc'd and always was That  Platonick  Love is  Platonick  Nonsense 'Tis the Fly buzzing about the Blaze till its Wings are scorch'd Or to speak still stronger It is a Bait of the Devil to catch the Unexperienc'd and Thoughtless Nor ought such Notions to be pretended to till the Parties are Five or Ten Years on the other Side of their  Grand Climacterick For Age Oldage and nothing else must establish the Barriers to  Platonick  Love But continued he this was my comparative Consolation tho' a very bad one that had I swerv'd I should not have been the only Instance where Persons more scrupulous than I pretend to be have begun Friendships even with spiritual Views and ended them as grosly as I could do were the Lady to have been as frail as her Tempter  Here Madam Mr  B  finished his Narrative He is now set out for  Tunbridge  with all my Papers I have no Doubt in his Honour and kind Assurances and hope my next will be a joyful Letter and that I shall inform you in it that the Affair which went so near my Heart is absolutely concluded to my Satisfaction to Mr  B  's and to the  Countess  for if it be so to all three my Happiness will be founded on a permanent Basis I hope Mean time I am my dear good Lady  Your most affectionate and obliged Sister and Servant  P B  LETTER XL  A New Misfortune my dear LadyBut this is of God Almighty's sending so must bear it patiently My dear Baby is taken with the Smallpox To how many Troubles are the happiest of us subjected in this Life One need not multiply them by one's own wilful MismanagementsI am able to mind nothing else  I had so much Joy as I told your Ladyship in the Beginning of my last Letter but one to see on our Arrival at the Farmhouse my dearest Mr  B  my beloved Baby and my good Father and Mother all upon one happy Spot together that I fear I was too proudYet I was truly thankfulI am sure I wasBut I had notwithstanding too much Pride and too much Pleasure on this happy Occasion  I told your Ladyship in my last that your dear Brother set out on  Tuesday  Morning for  Tunbridge  with my Papers And I was longing to know the Result hoping that every thing would be concluded to the Satisfaction of all Three For thought I if this be so my Happiness must be permanent But alas alas There is nothing permanent in this Life I feel it by Experience nowI knew it before by Theory But that was not so near and so interesting by half  For in the Midst of all my Pleasures and Hopes in the Midst of my dear Parents Joy and Congratulations on our Arrival and on what had passed so happily since we were last here together in the Birth of the dear Child and my Safety for which they had been so apprehensive the dear Baby was taken ill It was on that very  Tuesday  Afternoon his Papa set out for  Tunbridge  But we knew not it would be the Smallpox till  Thursday  Oh Madam how are all the Pleasures I had form'd to myself sicken'd now upon me for my  Billy  is very bad  They talk of a kind Sort but alas they talk at random for they come not out at all How then can they say they are kindI fear the Nurse's Constitution is too hale and too rich for the dear BabyHad  I  been permittedBut hush all my repining  Ifs  Except one  If  and that  If  it be got happily over it will be best he had it so young and while at the Breast  Oh Madam Madam The small Appearance that there was is gone in again And my Child my dear Baby will dieThe Doctors seem to think so  They want to send for Mr  B  to keep me from himBut I forbid itFor what signifies Life or any thing if I cannot see my Baby while he is so dangerously ill  My Father and Mother are for the first time quite cruel to me they have forbid me and I never was so desirous of disobeying them before to attend the Darling of my Heart And whyFor fear of this poor FaceFor fear I should get it myselfBut I am living low very low and have taken proper Precautions by Bleeding and the like to lessen the Distemper's Fury if I should have it And the rest I leave to Providence And if Mr  B  's Value is confin'd so much to this poor transitory Sightliness he must not break with his Countess I think and if I am ever so deform'd in Person my poor Intellects I hope will not be impair'd and I shall if GOD spare my  Billy  be useful in his first Education and be helpful to dear Miss  Goodwin  or to any Babieswith all my Hearthe may make me an humble Nurse toHow peevish sinfully so I doubt does this Accident and their affectionate Contradiction make one  I have this Moment received the following from Mr  B  Maidstone  "My dearest Love  "I AM greatly touched with the dear Boy's Malady which I have this Moment heard of I desire you instantly to come to me hither in the Chariot with the Bearer Mr  Colbrand  I know what your Grief must be But as you can  do the Child no Good I beg you'll oblige me Every thing is in a happy Train but I can think of nobody but you and for  your  sake principally but not a little for  my own  my Boy I will set out to meet you for I chuse not to come myself lest you should endeavour to persuade me to permit your tarrying about him and I should be sorry to deny you any thing I have taken here handsome Apartments for you till the Event which I pray GOD may be happy shall better determine me what to do I will be ever  "Your most affectionate and faithful"  Maidstone  indeed is not so very far off but one may hear every Day once or twice by a Man and Horse so I will go to shew my Obedience since Mr  B  is so intent upon itBut I cannot live if I am not permitted to come backOh let me be enabled gracious Father to close this Letter more happily than I have begun it  I have been so dreadfully uneasy at  Maidstone  that Mr  B  has been so good as to return with me hither and I find my Baby's Case not yet quite desperateI am easier now I see him in Presence of his beloved Papawho lets me have all my Way and approves of my preparative Method for myself and he tells me that since I will have it so he will indulge me in my Attendance on the Child and endeavour to imitate my Reliance on GODthat is his kind Expression and leave the Issue to Him And on my telling him that I feared nothing in the Distemper but the Loss of his Love he said in Presence of the Doctors and my Father and Mother pressing my Hand to his Lips My dearest  Life make yourself easy under this Affliction and apprehend nothing for yourself I love you more for your Mind than your Face That and your Person will be the same and were that sweet Face to be cover'd with Seams and Scars I will value you the more for the Misfortune And glad I am that I had your Picture so well drawn in Town to satisfy those who have heard of your Loveliness what you were and hitherto are For myself my Admiration lies deeper and drawing me to the other End of the Room whisperingly he said The last Uneasiness between us was now I begin to think necessary because it has turned all my Delight in you more than ever to the Perfections of your Mind and so GOD preserves to me the Life of my  Pamela  I care not for my own Part what Ravages the Distemper makes here and tapp'd my Cheek  How generous how noble how comforting was thisI will make this Use of it I will now be resigned more and more to this Dispensation and prepare myself for the worst for it is the Dispensation of that GOD who gave me my Baby and all I have  When I retir'd the Reflections which I made on supposing the worst gave Birth to the following serious Lines for I cannot live without Pen and Ink in my Hand written as by a third Person suppose a good Minister Your Ladyship will be pleased to give them your favourable Allowances  Tell me fond weeping Parent why  Thou fearst so much thy Child should die  'Tis true tho'  human Frailty  may  Yet  Reason  can't have much to say  What is it thou thyself hast found  In this dull heavy tiresome Round  Of Lifeto make thee wish thy Son  Should thro' the like dark Mazes run  Suppose the worst'Twill end thy Fears  And free thee from a world of Cares  For Oh what anxious Thoughts arise  From hopefull'st Youths to damp our Joys  Who from the Morning's brightest Ray  Can promise what will be the Day  When I went from my Apartment to go to my Child my dear Mr  B  met me at the Nursery Door and led me back again You must not go in again my Dearest They have just been giving the Child other Things to try to drive out the Malady and some Pustules seem to promise on his Breast I made no Doubt my Baby was then in Extremity and I would have given the World to have shed a few Tears but I could not  With the most soothing Goodness he led me to my Desk and withdrew to attend the dear Baby himselfto see his last Gaspings poor little Lamb I make no doubt  This Suspense and my own strange Hardness of Heart that would not give up one Tear for the Passage from  that  to my  Eyes  seem'd quite choak'd up which used to be so open and ready on other Occasions affecting ones too produced these Lines  Why does my fullswoln Heart deny  The Tear reliefful to my Eye  If all my Joys are pass'd away  And thou dear Boy to Parent Clay  Art hasting the last Debt to pay  Resign me to thy Will my God  Let me with Patience bear this Rod  However heavy be the Stroke  If thou wilt not his Doom revoke  Let me all sinful Anguish shun  And say resign'd  Thy Will be done  Two Days have pass'd dreadful Days of Suspense and now blessed be GOD who has given me Hope that our Prayers are heard the Pustules come kindly out very thick in his Breast and on his Face but of a good Sort they tell meThey won't let me see him indeed they won'tWhat cruel Kindness is this One must believe all they tell one  But my dear Lady my Spirits are so weak and I have such a violent Headach and have such a strange shivering Disorder all running down my Back and I was so hot just now and am so cold at this presentAguishly inclin'dI don't know howthat I must leave off the Post going away with the Assurance that I am and will be to the last Hour of my Life  Your Ladyship's grateful and obliged Sister and Servant  P B  LETTER XLI From Mr  B  to Lady  DAVERS    My dear Sister  I Take very kindly your Solicitude for the Health of my beloved  Pamela  The last Line she wrote was to you for she took to her Bed the Moment she laid down her Pen  I told her your kind Message and Wishes for her Safety by my Lord's Gentleman and she begg'd I would write a Line to thank you in her Name for your affectionate Regards to her  She is in a fine way to do well for with her accustomed Prudence she had begun to prepare herself by a proper Regimen the Moment she knew the Child's Illness was the Smallpox  The worst is over with the Boy which keeps up her Spirits and her Mother is so excellent a Nurse to both and we are so happy likewise in the Care of a skilful Physician Dr  M    ho directs and approves of every thing the good Dame does that it is a singular Providence this Malady seiz'd them here and affords no small Comfort to the dear Creature herself  When I tell you that to all Appearance her charming Face will not receive any Disfigurement by this cruel Enemy to Beauty I am sure you will congratulate me upon a Felicity so desirable But were it to be otherwise if I were capable of slighting a Person whose principal Beauties are much deeper than the Skin I should deserve to be thought the most unworthy and superficial of Husbands  Whatever your Notions have been my everready censuring Lady  Davers  of your Brother on a certain Affair I do assure you That I never did and never can love any Lady as I love my  Pamela    It is indeed impossible I can ever love her better than I do and her outward Beauties are far from being indifferent to me yet if I know myself I am sure I have Justice enough to love her  equally  and Generosity enough to be  more tender  of her were she to suffer by this Distemper But as her Humility and her Affection to me would induce her to think herself under greater Obligation to me  for such my Tenderness to her were she to lose any the  least  valuable of her Perfections I rejoice that she will have no Reason for Mortification on that Score  My Respects to Lord  Davers  and all your noble Neighbours I am  Your affectionate Brother And humble Servant  LETTER XLII From Lady  DAVERS  in Answer to the preceding  My dear Brother  I DO most heartily congratulate you on the Recovery of Master  Billy  and the good Way my Sister is in I am the more rejoic'd as her sweet Face is not likely to suffer by the Malady for be the Beauties of the Mind what they will those of Person are no small Recommendation with some Folks I am sure and I began to be afraid that when it was hardly possible for  both conjoined  to keep a roving Mind constant that  one only  would not be sufficient  This News gives me the more Pleasure because I am well inform'd that a certain gay Lady was pleased to give herself Airs upon hearing of my Sister's Illness as That she could not be sorry for it for now she should look upon herself as the prettiest Woman in  England  She meant only I suppose as to  outward  Prettiness Brother  You give me the Name of a  ready Censurer  I own I think myself to be not a little interested in all  that regards my Brother and his Honour But when some People are not readier to  censure  than others to  trespass  I know not whether they can with Justice be styled  censorious    But however that be the Rod seems to have been held up as a Warningand that the Blow in the irreparable Deprivation is not given is a Mercy that I hope will be deserved tho' you never can those very signal ones you receive at the Divine Hands beyond any Gentleman I know For even if I shall not be deemed censorious again your very Vices have been turned to your Felicity as if GOD would try the Nobleness of the Heart he has given you by overcoming you in Answer to my Sister's constant Prayers as well as mine by Mercies rather than by Judgments  I might give Instances of the Truth of this bservation in almost all the Actions and Attempts of your past Life And take care if you  are  displeased I  will  speak it take care thou bold Wretch that if this Method be ingratefully slighted the uplifted Arm fall not down with double Weight on thy devoted Head  I must always love and honour my Brother but cannot help speaking my Mind Which after all is the natural Result of that very Love and Honour and which obliges me to style myself  Your truly affectionate Sister  B DAVERS  LETTER XLIII From Mrs  B  to Lady  DAVERS    My dearest Lady  MY first Letter and my first Devoirs after those of Thankfulness to that gracious GOD who has so happily conducted me thro' two such heavy Trials as my Child's and my own Illness must be directed to your Ladyship with all due Acknowlegement of your generous and affectionate Concern for me  We are now preparing for our Journey to  Bedfordshire  and there to my great Satisfaction I am to be favour'd with the Care of Miss  Goodwin    After we have tarry'd about a Month there Mr  B  will make a Tour with me thro' several Counties taking the Hall in the Way for about a Fortnight and shew me what is remarkable everywhere as we pass for this he is pleased to think will better contribute to my Health than any other Method for the Distemper has left upon me a kind of Weariness and Listlessness And he proposes to be out with me till the  Bath  Season begins and by the Aid of those healing and balsamick Waters he hopes I shall be quite establish'd Afterwards he purposes to return to  Bedfordshire  for a little while then to  London  then to  Kent  and if nothing hinders has a great mind to carry me over to  Paris    Thus most kindly does he amuse and divert me with his agreeable Schemes and Proposals But I have made one Amendment to them and that is that I must not be deny'd to pay my Respects to  your Ladyship at your Seat and to my good Lady Countess and this will be far from being the loast of my Pleasures  I have had Congratulations without Number on my Recovery but one among the rest I did not expect from the Countess Dowager Could you think it Madam Who sent me by her Gentleman the following Letter from  Tunbridge    "  Dear Mrs  B  "I Hope among the Congratulations of your numerous Admirers on your happy Recovery my very sincere ones will not be unacceptable I have no other Motive for making you my Compliments on this Occasion on so slender an Acquaintance than the Pleasure it gives me that the Publick as well as your private Friends have not been deprived of a Lady whose Example in every Duty of Life is of so much Concern to both May you Madam long rejoice in an uninterrupted State of Happiness answerable to your Merits and to your own Wishes are those of  "Your most obedient humble Servant"  To this kind Letter I return'd the following  "My good Lady  I AM under the highest Obligation to your generous Favour in your kind Compliments of Congratulation on my Recovery There is something so noble and so condescending in the Honour you have done me on so slender an Acquaintance that it bespeaks the exalted Mind and Character of a Lady who in the Principles  of Generosity and in true Nobleness of Nature has no Example May God Almighty bless you my dear Lady with all the Good you wish me and with Increase of Honour and Glory both here and hereafter prays and will always pray  "  Your Ladyship's "Most obliged and obedient Servant  "P B"  This leads me to mention to your Ladyship what my Illness would not permit me to do before that Mr  B  met with such a Reception and Audience from the Countess when he attended her in all he had to offer and propose to her and in her patient Hearing of what he thought fit to read her from your Ladyship's Letters and mine that he said Don't be jealous my dear  Pamela  but I must admire her as long as I live  He gave me the Particulars so much to her Ladyship's Honour that I told him he should not only be welcome to admire her Ladyship but that I would admire her too  They parted very good Friends and with great Professions of Esteem for each otherAnd as Mr  B  had undertaken to inspect into some exceptionable Accounts and Managements of her Ladyship's Bailiff one of her Servants brought a Letter for him on  Monday  last wholly written on that Subject But her Ladyship was so kindly considerate as to send it unsealed in a Cover directed to me When I open'd it I was frighted to see it begin to Mr  B  and I hastened to find him in the Walk up to the newrais'd MountDear SirHere's some MistakeYou see the Direction is to Mrs  B  'Tis very plainBut upon my Word I have not read it  Don't be uneasy my LoveI know what the Subject must be but I dare swear there is nothing nor will there ever be but what you or any body may see  He read it and giving it to me to peruse said Answer yourself the Postscript my DearThat was  "If Sir the Trouble I give you is likely to subject you or your Lady to Uneasiness or Apprehensions I beg you will not interfere in it I will then set about the Matter myself for my Uncle I will not trouble Yet Women enter into these Particulars with as little Advantage to themselves as Inclination"  I told him I was intirely easy and unapprehensive and after all his Goodness to me should be so if he saw the Countess every Day That's kindly said my Dear return'd he but I will not trust myself to see her every Day or at all for the present I'll assure you I will notBut I shall be obliged to correspond with her for a Month or so on this Occasion Unless you prohibit it and it shall be in your Power to do so  I said With my whole Heart he might and I should be quite easy in both their Honours  Yet will I not  Pamela  said he unless you see our Letters for I know she will always now she has begun send in a Cover to you what she will write to me unseal'd and whether I am at home or abroad I shall take it unkindly if you do not read them  He went in with me and wrote an Answer which he sent by the Messenger but would make me whether I would or not read it and seal it up with his Seal But all this needed not to me  now who think so much better of the Lady than I did before and am so well satisfy'd in his own Honour and generous Affection for me for you saw Madam in what I wrote before that he always loved me tho' he was angry at times at my Change of Temper as he apprehended it not knowing that I was apprised of what passed between him and the Countess  I really am better pleas'd with this Correspondence than I should have been had it not been carry'd on because the Servants on both Sides will see by my Deportment on the Occasion and I will officiously with a smiling Countenance throw myself in their Observation that it is quite innocent and this may help to silence the Mouths of those who have so freely censur'd their Conduct  Indeed Madam I think I have received no small Good myself by that Affair which once lay so heavy upon me For I don't believe I shall ever be jealous again indeed I don't think I shall And won't that be an ugly Foible overcome I see what may be done in Cases not favourable to our Wishes by the Aid of proper Reflection and that the Bee is not the only Creature that may make Honey out of the bitter Flowers as well as the sweet  My best and most grateful Respects and Thanks to my good Lord  Davers  to the Earl and his excellent Countess and most particularly to Lady  Betty  with whose kind Compliments your Ladyship acquaints me and to Mr  H  for all your united Congratulations on my Recovery What Obligations do I lie under to such noble and generous Wellwishers I can make no Return but by my Prayers that God by  his  Goodness will supply all my Defects And these will always attend you from my dearest Lady  Your ever obliged Sister and humble Servant  P B  Mr  H  is just arriv'd He says He comes a special Messenger to make a Report how my Face has come off He makes me many Compliments upon it How kind your Ladyship is to enter so favourably into the minutest Concerns which you think may any way affect my future Happiness in your dear Brother's WishesI want to pour out all my Joy and my Thankfulness to God before your Ladyship and my good Lady Countess of  C  For I am a happy yea a blessed Creature Mr  B  's Boy your Ladyship's Boy and my Boy is charmingly well quite strong and very forward for his Months and his Papa is delighted with him more and more  LETTER XLIV  My dear Miss  DARNFORD  I HOPE you are happy and well You kindly say you can't be so till you hear of my perfect Recovery And this blessed be God you have heard already from Mr  B  As to your Intimation of the fair Nun 'tis all happily over Blessed be God for that too And I have a better and more indearing Husband than ever Did you think that could be  My  Billy  too improves every Day And my dear Father and Mother seem to have their Youth renew'd like the Eagle's How many Blessings have I to be thankful for  We are about to turn Travellers to the Northern Counties I think quite to the Borders and afterwards to the Western to  Bath  to  Bristol  and I know not whither myself But among the rest to  Lincolnshire  that you may be sure of Then how happy shall I be in my dear Miss  Darnford  I long to hear whether poor Mrs  Jewkes  is better or worse for the Advice of the Doctor whom I order'd to attend her from  Stamford  and in what Frame her Mind is  Do my dear Miss vouchsafe her a Visit in my Name tell her if she be lowspirited what God has done for me as to my Recovery and comfort her all you can and bid her spare neither Expence nor Attendance nor any thing her Heart can wish for nor the Company of any Relations or Friends she may desire to be with her  If she is in her  last Stage  poor Soul how noble will it be in you to give her Comfort and Consolation in her dying Hours  Altho' we can merit nothing at the Hand of God yet I have a Notion that we cannot deserve more of one another and in some Sense for that Reason of HIM than in our Charities on so trying an Exigence When the poor Soul stands shivering as it were on the Edge of Life and has nothing strong but its Fears and DoubtsThen a little Balm pour'd into the Wounds of the Mind a little comforting Advice to rely on God's Mercies from a good Person how consolatory must it be And how like Morning Mists before the Sun must all Diffidences and gloomy Doubts be chased away by it  But my dear Miss the great Occasion of my writing to you just now is by Lady  Davers  's Desire on a quite different Subject She knows how we love one another And she has sent me the following Lines by her Kinsman who came to  Kent  purposely to inquire how my Face far'd in the Smallpox and accompany'd us from  Kent  hither  i e  to  Bedfordshire  and sets out Tomorrow for Lord  Davers  's  My dear  PAMELA  "  JACKEY  will tell you the Reason of his Journey my Curiosity on your own Account And I send this Letter by him but he knows not the Contents My good Lord  Davers  wants to have his Nephew marry'd and settled in the World And his noble Father leaves the whole Matter to my Lord as to the Person Settlements  c  "Now I as well as my Lord think so highly of the Prudence the Person and Family of your Miss  Darnford  that we shall be obliged to you to sound that young Lady on this score  "I know Mr  H  would wish for no greater Happiness But if Miss is engag'd or cannot love my Nephew I don't care nor would my Lord that such a Proposal should be receiv'd with undue Slight His Birth the Title and Estate he is Heir to are Advantages that require a Lady's Consideration He has not indeed so much Wit as Miss but he has enough for a Lord whose Friends are born before him as the Phrase is is very goodhumour'd no Fool no Sot no Debauchee And let me tell you these are Circumstances not to be met with every Day in a young Man of Quality  "As to Settlements Fortune  c  I fansy there would be no great Difficulties The Business is If Miss could love him well enough for a Husband That we leave to you to sound the young Lady and if she thinks she can we will directly begin a Treaty with Sir  Simon  on that Subject I am my dearest  Pamela    Your ever affectionate Sister  B DAVERS  Now my dear Miss as my Lady has so well stated the Case I beg you to inable me to re  urn an  Answer I will not say one Word  pro  or  con  till I know your Mind Only that I think he is goodhumour'd and might be easily persuaded to any thing a Lady should think reasonable  And now I must tell you another Piece of News in the matrimonial way Mr  Williams  has been here to congratulate us on our multiply'd Blessings and he has acquainted Mr  B  that an Overture has been made him by his new Patron for I suppose you know that all is adjusted according to the Scheme I formerly acquainted you with  See  Vol III  p    between Mr  Adams  and him and both are settled in their respective Livings only that I ought to have to have told you that Mr  Williams  on mature Consideration declin'd the stipulated  l per Annum  from Mr  Adams  as he thought it would have a Simoniacal Appearance of a Kinswoman of his Lordship's a Lady of Virtue and Merit and a Fortune of  l  to make him Amends as the Earl tells him for quitting a better Living to oblige him and that he is in great Hope of obtaining the Lady's Consent which is all that is wanting Mr  B  is very much pleased with so good a Prospect in Mr  Williams  's Favour and has been in the Lady's Company formerly at a Ball at  Gloucester  and he says she is a prudent and deserving Lady and offers to make a Journey on Purpose to forward it if he can be of Service  But now my Hand's in let me tell you of a third matrimonial Proposition which gives me more Puzzle and Dislike a great deal And that is Mr  Adams  has with great Reluctance and after abundance of bashful Apologies requested of me to know If I have any Objection to his making his Addresses to  Polly Barlow  Which however he told me he had  not mention'd to her nor to any body living because he would first know whether I should take it amiss as her Service was so immediately about my Person  This unexpected Motion perplex'd me a good deal The Gentleman is a worthy and a pious Man He has now a very good Living but is but just enter'd upon it and I think according to his accustom'd Prudence in other respects had better have turn'd himself about first  But that is not the Point with me neither I have a great Regard to the Function I think it is as necessary in order to preserve the Respect due to the Clergy that their Wives should be nearly if not quite as unblemish'd and as circumspect as themselves and this for the Gentleman's own sake as well as in the Eye of the World for how shall he pursue his Studies with Comfort to himself if he be made uneasy at home or how shall he expect his Female Parishioners will regard his  publick  Preaching when he cannot influence the  private  Practice of his Wife  I can't say excepting in the Instance of Mr  H  but  Polly  is a good sort of Body enough so far as I know But that is such a Blot in the poor Girl's Escutcheon a Thing not  accidental  not  surpris'd  into not owing to  Inattention  but to cool  Premeditation  after she had slept over and over upon it that I think I could wish Mr  Adams  a Wife more unexceptionable  'Tis true Mr  Adams  knows not this but  that  is one of my Difficulties If I tell him I shall hurt the poor Maiden irreparably and deprive her of a Gentleman for a Husband to whom she may possibly make a good Wife For she is not very meanly descended much better than myself as the World would account it were they to judge from my my Father's low Estate when I was exaltedI never dear Miss shall be asham'd of these Retrospections  She is genteel has a very innocent Look a good Face is neat in her Person and not addicted to any Excess that I know of But  still  my dear Miss that one  premeditated  Fault is so sad a one that tho' she might make a good Wife for any middling Man of Business yet she wants methinks that Purity that Conduct which I would always have in the Wife of a good Clergyman  Then besides she has not apply'd her Thoughts to that sort of Oeconomy which is proper for the Wife of a Country Clergyman to know something of And she has a Turn to Dress and Appearance that I can see if indulg'd she would not be one that would help to remove the Scandal which some severe Remarkers are apt to throw upon the Wives of  Parsons  as they call them  The Maiden I believe likes Mr  Adams  not a little She is very courteous to every body but most to him of any body and never has miss'd being present at our  Sunday  Duties and five or six times Mrs  Jervis  tells me she has found her desirous to have Mr  Adams  expound this Text and that Difficulty and the good Man is taken with her Piety Which and her Reformation I hope is sincere But Oh Miss she is very sly very subtle as I have found in several Instances as foolish as she was in the Affair I hint at  So sometimes I say to myself The Girl may love Mr  Adams  Ay but then I answer So she did Mr  H  and on his own very bad Terms too In short but I won't be too censorious neither  So I'll say no more than that I was perplexed and yet should be very glad to have  Polly  well marry'd for since  that  Time I have always had some Diffidences about her Because you know Miss her Fault was so enormous and so premeditated  I wanted you to advise with But this was the Method I took  I appointed Mr  Adams  to drink a Dish of Tea with me in the Afternoon  Polly  attended as she generally does for I can't say I love Men Attendants in these womanly Offices A Teakettle in a Man's Hand that would if there was no better Imployment for him be fitter to hold a Plough or handle a Flail or a Scythe has such a Look with it This is like my low Breeding some would say perhaps But I cannot call Things polite that I think unseemly and moreover let me tell you Lady  Davers  keeps me in Countenance in this my Notion and who doubts her Politeness  Well but  Polly  attended as I said and there were strange Simperings and Bowing and Court'sying between them the honest Gentleman seeming not to know how to let his Mistress wait upon him while she behav'd with as much Respect and Officiousness as if she could not do too much for him  Very well thought I I have such an Opinion of your Veracity Mr  Adams  that I dare say you have not because you told me you have not mention'd the Matter to  Polly  But between her Officiousness and your mutual Simperings and Complaisance I see you have found out a Language between you that is full as significant as plain  English  Words  Polly  thought I sees no Difficulty in  this  Text nor need you Mr  Adams  have much Trouble to make her understand when you come to expound on  this  Subject  I was forced in short to put on a statelier and more reserv'd Appearance than usual to make them avoid Acts of Complaisance for one another that might not be proper to be shewn before me from one who sat as my Companion to my Servant  When she withdrew the modest Gentleman hem'd and look'd on one Side and turn'd to the right and left as if his Seat was uneasy to him and I saw knew not how to speak so I began in mere Compassion to him and said Mr  Adams  I have been thinking of what you mention'd to me as to  Polly Barlow    Hem Hem said he and pull'd out his Handkerchief and wip'd his Mouth Very well Madam I hope no Offence Madam  No Sir none at all But I am at a Loss how to distinguish in this Case whether it may not be from a Motive of too humble Gratitude that you don't think yourself above matching with  Polly  as you may suppose her a Favourite of mine or whether it be your Value for her Person and Qualities that makes her more agreeable in your Eyes than any other Person would be  Madam Madam said the bashful Gentleman hesitatingly I do I must needs say I can't but own that Mrs  Mary  is a Person whom I think very agreeable and no less modest and virtuous  You know Sir your own Circumstances To be sure you have a very pretty House and a good Living to carry a Wife to And a Gentleman of your Prudence and Discretion wants not any Advice But you have reap'd no Benefits by your Living It has been an Expence to you rather that you will not presently get up Do you propose an early Marriage Sir Or were it not better that you suspended your Intentions of that sort for a Year or two more  Madam if your Ladyship chuse not to part with  Nay Mr  Adams  interrupted I I say not any thing for my own sake in this Point that is out of the Question with me I can very willingly part with  Polly  were it Tomorrow for her Good and yours  Madam said he I humbly beg Pardon but but Delays may breed Dangers  Oh very well thought I I'll be further if the artful Girl has not let him know by some Means or other that she has some other humble Servant  And so Miss it has proved For dismissing my Gentleman with assuring him that I had no Objection at all to the Matter or to parting with  Polly  as soon as it suited with their Conveniency I founded her and asked If she thought Mr  Adams  had any Affection for her  She said He was a very good Gentleman  I know it  Polly  and are you not of Opinion he loves you a little  Dear Ma'm good your Ladyship love me I don't know what such a Gentleman as Mr  Adams  should see in me to love me  Oh thought I does the Objection lie on  that  Side then I see 'tis not of  thine    Well but  Polly  if you have  another  Sweetheart you should do the fair Thing that you should it would be wrong if you encourag'd any body else if you thought of Mr  Adams    Indeed Ma'm I had a Letter sent me A Letter that I receiv'd from from a young Man in  Bedford  but I never gave an Answer to it  Oh thought I then thou wouldst not encourage  two at once  this was as plain a Declaration as I wanted that she had Thoughts of Mr  Adams    But how came Mr  Adams Polly  to know of this Letter  How came Mr  Adams  to know of it Ma'm repeated she half surpris'd Why I don't know I cann't tell how it was but I dropp'd it near his Desk pulling out my Handkerchief I believe Ma'm and he brought it after me and gave it me again  Well thought I thou'rt an intriguing Slut I doubt  Polly Delays may breed Dangers  quoth the poor Gentleman Ah Girl Girl thought I but did not say so thou deservest to be blown up and to have thy Plot spoiled that thou dost But if thy Forwardness should expose thee afterwards to Evils which thou mayst avoid if thy Schemes take Place I should very much blame myself And I see he loves thee So let the Matter take its Course I will trouble myself no more about it 'Tis an invidious Task and I wish thou wilt but make Mr  Adams  the Wife he deserves  And so I dismiss'd her telling her That whoever thought of being a Clergyman's Wife should resolve to be as good as himself to set an Example to all her Sex in the Parish and shew how much his Doctrines had Weight with her should be humble circumspect gentle in her Temper and Manners frugal not proud nor vying in Dress with the Ladies of the Laity should resolve to sweeten his Labours and to be obliging in her Deportment to Poor as well as Rich that her Husband got no Discredit thro' her Means which would weaken his Influence upon His Auditors and that she must be most of all obliging to him and study his Temper that his Mind might be more disingag'd in order to pursue his Studies with the better Effect  And so much my dear Miss  Darnford  for  your  humble Servant and for Mr  Williams  's and Mr  Adams  's matrimonial Prospects And don't think me disrespectful that I have mention'd my  Polly  's Affair in the same Letter with yours For in High and Low I forget the  Latin  Phrase I have not had a Lesson a long long while from my dear Tutor Love is in all the same But whether you'll like Mr  H  as well as  Polly  does Mr  Adams  that's the Question But leaving that to your own Decision I  conclude with one Observation That altho' I thought ours was a House of as little Intriguing as any body's since the dear Master of it has left off that Practice yet I cannot see that any Family can be clear of some of it long together where there are Men and Women worth plotting for as Husbands and Wives  My best Wishes and Respects attend you all my most worthy Neighbours I hope ere many Months are past to assure you all severally to wit Sir  Simon  my Lady and your dear Self Mrs  Jones  Mr  Peters  and his Lady and Niece whose kind Congratulations make me very proud and very thankful how much I am obliged to you and particularly my dear Miss how much I am  Your ever affectionate and faithful Friend and Servant  P B  LETTER XLV From Miss  DARNFORD  in Answer to the preceding  My dear Mrs  B  I HAVE been several times in Company with Mr  Peters  to see Mrs  Jewkes  The poor Woman is very bad and cannot live many Days We comfort her all we can but she often accuses herself of her past Behaviour to so excellent a Lady and with Blessings upon Blessings heaped upon you and her Master and your charming little Boy she is continually declaring how much your Goodness to her exasperates her former Faults to her own Conscience  She has her Sisterinlaw and her Niece with her and has settled all her Affairs and thinks she is not long for this World  Her Distemper is an inward Decay all at once as it were from a Constitution that seem'd like one of Iron and she is a mere Skeleton You would not know her I'm sure  I will see her every Day and she has given me up all her Keys and Accompts to give Mr  Longman  who is daily expected and I hope will be here soon for her Sisterinlaw she says herself is a Woman of  this World  as  she  has been  Mr  Peters  calling on me to go with him to visit her I will break off here  Mrs  Jewkes  is much as she was but your faithful Steward is come I am glad of it and so is she Nevertheless I will go every Day and do all the Good I can for the poor Woman according to your charitable Desires and excellent Intentions  I thank you Madam for your Communication of Lady  Davers  's Letter I am much obliged to my Lord and her Ladyship and should have been proud of an Alliance with that noble Family But with all Mr  H  's good Qualities as my Lady paints them out I could not for the World make him my Husband  I'll tell you one of my Objections in Confidence tho' for you are only to  sound  me you know and I would not have it mention'd that I have taken any Thought about the Matter because a stronger Reason may be given such an one as my Lord and Lady will both allow which I will communicate to you byandby  My Objection arises even from what you intimate of Mr  H  's Goodhumour and his Persuadableness if I may so say Now Madam were I of a boisterous Temper and high Spirit such an one as  required great Patience in a Husband to bear with me then Mr  H  's Character of Goodhumour might have been a Consideration with me But when I have I pride myself in the Thought a Temper not wholly unlike your own and such an one as would not want to contend for Superiority with a Husband it is no Recommendation to me that Mr  H  is a goodhumour'd Gentleman and will bear with Faults I design not to be guilty of  But my dear Mrs  B  my Husband must be a Man of Sense and must give me Reason to think he has a superior Judgment to my own or I shall be unhappy He will otherwise do wrongheaded Things I shall be forced to oppose him in them He will be obstinate and tenacious and will be taught to talk of Prerogative and to call himself a Man without knowing how to behave as one and I to despise him of course and so be deem'd a bad Wife when I hope I have Qualities that would make me a tolerable good one with a Man of Sense for my Husband You know who says  For Fools  pardon me this harsh Word 'tis in my Author  For Fools are stubborn in their Way  As Coins are harden'd by th' Allay  And Obstinacy's ne'er so stiff  As when 'tis in a wrong Belief  Now you must not think I would dispense with real Goodhumour in a Man No I make it one of my  Indispensables  in a Husband A goodnatur'd Man will put the best Constructions on what happens But he must have Sense to  distinguish  the best He will be kind to little unwilful undesigned Failings But he must have Judgment to distinguish what  are  or are  not  so  But Mr  H  's Goodhumour is Softness as I may call it and my Husband must be such an one in  short as I need not be asham'd to be seen with in Company one who being my Head must not be beneath all the Gentlemen he may happen to fall in with and who every time he is adjusting his Mouth for Speech will give me Pain at my Heart and Blushes in my Face even before he speaks  I could not bear that every Gentleman and every Lady we encounter'd should be prepar'd▪ whenever he offer'd to open his Lips by their contemptuous Smiles to expect some weak and silly Things from him and when he  had  spoken that he should with a booby Grin seem pleased that he had not disappointed them  The only recommendatory Point in Mr  H  is that he dresses exceedingly smart and is no contemptible Figure of a Man But dear Madam you know that's so much the worse when the Man's Talent is not Taciturnity except before his Aunt Mr  B  and you when he is not conscious of internal Defect and values himself upon outward Appearance  As to his Attempt upon your  Polly  tho' I don't like him the better for it yet it is a Fault so wickedly common among Gentlemen that when a Lady resolves never to marry till a quite virtuous Man addresses her it is in other Words resolving to die single So that I make not this the  chief  Objection altho' I must tell you I would abate in my Expectations of half a dozen other good Qualities rather than that one of Virtue in a Husband  But when I reflect upon the Figure Mr  H  made in that Affair I cannot bear him and if I may judge of other Coxcombs by him what Wretches are these smart welldressing Querpofellows many of which you and I have seen admiring themselves at the Plays and Operas  This is one of my infallible Rules and I know it is yours too That he who is taken up with the  Admiration of his own sweet Person will never admire a Wife's His Delights are centred in himself and he will not wish to get out of that narrow that exceeding narrow Circle and in my Opinion should keep no Company but that of Tailors Wigpuffers and Milaners  But I will run on no further upon this Subject but will tell you a Reason that you  may  give to Lady  Davers  why her kind Intentions to me cannot be answer'd and which she'll take better than what I  have said  were she to know it as I hope you won't let her And this is My Papa has had a Proposal made to him from a Gentleman you have seen and have thought polite  See  Vol III  p    It is from Sir  W G  of this County who is one of  your  great Admirers and Mr  B  's too and that you must suppose makes me have never the worse Opinion of him or of his Understanding altho' it requires no great Sagacity or Penetration to see how much you adorn our Sex and human Nature too  Every thing was adjusted between my Papa and Mamma and Sir  William  on Condition we approv'd of each other before I came down which I knew not till I had seen him here four times and then my Papa surpris'd me into an half Approbation of him And this it seems was one of the Reasons I was so hurry'd down from you  I can't say but I like the Gentleman as well as most I have seen he is a Man of Sense and Sobriety to give him his Due and is in very easy Circumstances and much respected by all who know him and that's no bad Earnest you are sensible in a Marriage Prospect  But hitherto he seems to like me better than I do him I don't know how it is but I have often observ'd that when any thing is in our own Power we are not half so much taken with it as we should  be perhaps if we were kept in Suspense Why should this be  But this I am convinc'd of There is no Comparison between Sir  William  and Mr  Murray    Now I have nam'd this Brotherinlaw of mine what do you think  Why that good Couple have had their House on Fire three times already and that very dangerously too for once it was put out by Mr  Murray  's Mother who lives near them and twice Sir  Simon  has been forced to carry Water to extinguish it for Truly Mrs  Murray  would go home again to her Papa She would not live with such a surly Wretch And it was With all his Heart A fair Riddance for there was no bearing the House with such an illnatur'd WifeHer Sister  Polly  was worth a thousand of her  I am sorry heartily sorry for their Unhappiness But could she think every body must bear with her and her fretful Ways  They'll jangle on I reckon till they are better us'd to one another and when he sees she can't help it why he'll bear with her as Husbands generally do with illtemper'd Wives that is to say he'll try to make himself happy abroad and leave her to quarrel with her Maids instead of him for she must have somebody to vent her Spleen upon poor  Nancy  I am glad to hear of Mr  Williams  's good Fortune  As Mr  Adams  knows not  Polly  's Fault and it was prevented in time they may be happy enough She is a  sly  Girl I always thought her so Something so innocent and yet so artful in her very Looks She is an odd Compound of a Girl But these worthy and piously turn'd young Gentlemen who have but just quitted the College are mere Novices as to the World indeed they are  above  it while  in  it  they therefore give themselves little Trouble to study it and so depending on the Goodness of their own Hearts are more liable to be imposed upon than People of half their Understanding  I think as he seems to love her you do right not to hinder the Girl's Fortune But I wish she may take your Advice in her Behaviour to  him  at least for as to her Carriage to her Neighbours I doubt she'll be one of the Heads of the Parish presently in her own Estimation  'Tis pity methinks any worthy Gentleman of the Cloth should have a Wife who by a bad Example should pull down as fast as he by a good one can build up  This is not the Case of Mrs  Peters  however whose Example I wish was more generally follow'd by Gentlewomen who are made so by marrying a good Clergyman if they were not so before  Don't be surpris'd if you should hear that poor  Jewkes  is given overShe made a very exemplary Full of Blessings And more easy and resign'd than I apprehended she would be  I know you'll shed a Tear for the poor Woman I cann't help it myself But you will be pleas'd that she had so much Time given her and made so good Use of it  Mr  Peters  has been every thing that one would wish one of his Function to be in his Attendances and Advice to the poor Woman Mr  Longman  will take proper Care of every thing  So I will only add That I am with the sincerest Respects in Hopes to see you soon for I have a Multitude of things to talk to you about Dear Mrs  B  Your ever faithful and affectionate  POLLY DARNFORD  LETTER XLVI From Mrs  B  to Lady  DAVERS    My dear Lady  Davers  I Understand from Miss  Darnford  that before she went down from us her Papa had encourag'd a Proposal made by Sir  WG  whom you saw when your Ladyship was a kind Visitor in  Bedfordshire  We all agreed if your Ladyship remembers that he was a polite and sensible Gentleman and I find it is countenanc'd on all Hands  Poor Mrs  Jewkes  Madam as Miss informs me has paid her last Debt I hope thro' Mercy she is happy Poor poor WomanBut why say I so Since in  that  Case she will be richer than an earthly Monarch At least till he is levell'd with her in Death  Your Ladyship was once mentioning a Sister of Mrs  Worden  's whom you could be glad to recommend to some worthy FamilyShall I beg of you Madam to oblige Mr  B  's in this Particular I am sure she must have Merit if your Ladyship thinks well of her and your Commands in this as well as in every other Particular shall have their due Weight with  Your Ladyship's Obliged Sister and humble Servant  P B  Just now dear Madam Mr  B  tells me I shall have Miss  Goodwin  brought me hither Tomorrow  LETTER XLVII From lady  DAVERS  to Mrs  B  in Answer to the preceding  My dear  Pamela  I AM glad Miss  Darnford  is likely to be so happy in a Husband as Sir  W G  will certainly make her I was afraid that the Proposal I made would not do with Miss had she not had so good a Tender I want  too  to have the foolishFellow marry'd for several Reasons one of which is He is continually teizing us to permit him to go up to Town in order for him to reside there for some Months to  see the World  as he calls it But we are convinc'd he would  feel  it as well as  see  it if we gave way to his Request For in Understanding Dress and inconsiderate Vanity he is so exactly siz'd and cut out for a Town Fop Coxcomb or pretty Fellow as it is called that he will undoubtedly fall into all the Vices of those People and perhaps having such Expectations as he has will be made the Property of Rakes and Sharpers He complains that we use him like a Child in a Gocart or a Baby with Leadingstrings and that he must not be trusted out of our Sight 'Tis a sad thing that these  Bodies  will grow up to the Stature of Men when the  Minds  improve not at all with them but are still those of Boys and Children Yet he would certainly make a fond Husband for at present he has no very bad Qualities But is such a  Narcissus  But this between ourselves for his Uncle is wrapt up in the FellowAnd why Because he is goodhumour'd that's all He has vex'd me lately which makes me  write so angrily about him But 'tis not worth troubling you with the particulars  I hope Mrs  Jewkes  is happy as you say Poor Woman she seemed to promise for a longer Life But what shall we say  Your Compliment to me of my  Beck  's Sister is a very kind one I am greatly obliged to you for it Mrs  Oldham  is a sober grave Widow a little aforehand in the World but not much has liv'd well understands Household Management thoroughly is diligent and has a Turn to serious Things which will make you like her the better  I'll order  Beck  and her to wait on you in a Chaise and Pair and she will satisfy you in every thing as to what you may and may not expect of her  You cann't think how kindly I take this Motion from you You forget nothing that can oblige your Friends Little did think you would remember me of what I had forgotten in a manner my favourable Opinion and Wishes for her express'd so long ago But you are what you are a dear obliging Creature  Beck  is all Joy and Gratitude upon it and her Sister had rather serve you than the Princess You need be under no Difficulties about Terms She would serve you for nothing if you would accept of her Service  I am glad because it pleases you so much that Miss  Goodwin  will be soon put into your Care It will be happy for the Child and I hope she will be so dutiful to you as to give you no Pain for your generous Goodness to her Her Mamma has sent me a Present of some choice Products of that Climate with Acknowlegements of my Kindness to Miss I will send Part of it to you by your new Servant for so I presume to call her already  What a naughty Sister you are however to be so far advanc'd again as to be obliged to shorten your intended Excursions and yet not to send me Word of it yourself Don't you know how much I interest myself in every thing that makes for my Brother's Happiness and yours More especially in so material a Point as is the Increase of a Family that it is my Boast to be sprung from Yet I must find this out by Accident and by other Hands Is not this very slighting But never do so again and I'll forgive you now because of the Joy it gives me Who am  Your truly affectionate and obliged Sister  B DAVERS  I thank you for your Book upon the Plays you saw Inclosed is a List of some others which I desire you to read and to oblige me with your Remarks upon them at your Leisure tho' you may not perhaps have seen them by the Time you will favour me with your Observations  LETTER XLVIII From Mrs  B  to Lady  DAVERS    My dear Lady  Davers  I HAVE a valuable Present made me by the same excellent Lady So hope you will not take it amiss that with abundance of Thanks I return yours by Mrs  Worden  whose Sister I much approve of and thank your Ladyship for your kind Recommendation of so worthy a Gentlewoman We begin  with so much good Liking to one another that I doubt not we shall be very happy together  A moving Letter much more valuable to me than the handsome Present was put into my Hands at the same time with that of which the following is a Copy  LETTER From Mrs  WRIGHTSON  formerly Miss  SALLY GODFREY  to Mrs  B  Happy deservedly happy dear Lady  'PErmit these Lines to kiss your Hands from one who tho' she is a Stranger to your Person is not so to your Character  That  has reach'd us here in this remote Part of the World where you have as many Admirers as have heard of you But  I  more particularly am bound to be so by an Obligation that I can never discharge but by my daily Prayers for you and the Blessings I continually implore upon You and Yours  'I can write my whole Mind  to  you tho' I cannot from the most deplorable Infelicity receive  from  you the wish'd for Favour of a few Lines in Return written with the same Unreservedness So unhappy am I from the Effects of an Inconsideration and Weakness on one hand and Temptations on the other which You at a tenderer Age most nobly for your own Honour and that of your Sex have escaped Whilst IBut let my Tears in these Blots speak the rest as my Heart bleeds and has constantly bled ever since at the grievous Remembrance But believe me however dear Madam that 'tis Shame and Sorrow and not Pride and Impenitence that makes me loth  to speak out to so much Purity of Life and Manners my own odious Weakness  'Nevertheless I ought and I  will  accuse myself by Name Imagine then illustrious Lady truly illustrious for Virtues which are infinitely superior to all the Advantages of Birth and Fortune Imagine I say that in this Letter you see before you the  once  guilty and therefore I doubt  always  guilty but  ever penitent Sarah Godfrey  the unhappy tho' fond and tender Mother of the poor Infant to whom your generous Goodness as I am inform'd has extended itself in such manner as to make you desirous of taking her under your worthy Protection GOD for ever bless you for it prays an indulgent Mother who admires at an awful Distance that Virtue in you which she could not practise herself  'And will you my dearest Lady will you take under your own immediate Protection the poor unguilty Infant Will you love her for the sake of her suffering Mamma whom you know not for the sake of the Gentleman now so dear to you and so worthy of you as I hear with Pleasure he is And will you by the best Example in the World give me a moral Assurance that she will never sink into the Fault the Weakness the Crime I ought not to scruple to call it so of her poor inconsiderate But YOU are her Mamma  now  I will not think of a  guilty  one therefore And what a Joy is it to me in the midst of my heavy Reflections on my past Misconduct that my beloved  Sally  can boast a  virtuous  and  innocent Mamma  who has withstood the Snares and Temptations that have been so fatal elsewhere and whose Example and Instructions next to God's Grace will be the strongest Fences that can be wish'd for to her Honour  Once more I say and on my Knees I write it GOD for ever bless you here and augment your Joys hereafter for your generous Goodness to my poor and till now  motherless  Infant  'I hope the dear Child by her Duty and Obligeingness will do all in her little Power to make you Amends and never give you Cause to repent this your  unexampled  Kindness to  her  and to  me  She cannot I hope except her Mother's Crime has had an Influence upon her too much like that of an original Stain be of a sordid or an ingrateful Nature And O my poor  Sally  if you  are  and if you ever fail in your Duty to your new Mamma to whose Care and Authority I transfer my  whole  Right in you remember that you have no more a Mamma in me nor can you be intitled to my Blessing or to the Fruits of my Prayers for you which I make now on that  only  Condition your implicit Obedience to all your new Mamma's Commands and Directions  'You may have the Curiosity Madam to wish to know how I live For no doubt you have heard all my sad sad Story Know then that I am as happy as a poor Creature can be who has once so deplorably so inexcusably fallen I have a worthy Gentleman for my Husband who marry'd me as a Widow whose only Child by my former was the Care of her Papa's Friends particularly of good Lady  Davers  and her Brother Poor unhappy I to be under such a  sad  Necessity to disguise the Truth Mr  Wrightson  whose Name I am unworthily honour'd by has several times earnestly intreated me to send for the poor Child and to let her be join'd as his killing Thought that it cannot be with two others I have by him Judge my good Lady how that very Generosity which had I been  guiltless would have added to my Joys must wound me deeper than even ungenerous or unkind Usage from him could do And how heavy that Crime must lie upon me which turns my very Pleasures to Misery and fixes all the Joy I  can  know in Repentance for my past Misdeeds How happy are YOU Madam on the contrary YOU who have nothing of this sort to pall nothing to mingle with your Felicities who bless'd in an Honour untainted and a Conscience that cannot reproach you are enabled to enjoy every welldeserved Comfort as it offers itself and can  improve  it too by Reflection on  your  past Conduct While  mine  alas like a Winter Frost nips in the Bud every rising Satisfaction  'My Spouse is rich as well as generous and very tender of meHappy if I could think  myself  as deserving as  he  thinks me My principal Comfort as I hinted is in my Penitence for my past Faults and that I have a merciful God for my Judge who knows that Penitence to be sincere  'You may guess Madam from what I have said in what Light I  must  appear here and if you would favour me with a Line or two in Answer to the Letter you have now in your Hand it will be one of the greatest Pleasures I  can  receive A Pleasure next to that which I  have  receiv'd in knowing that the Gentleman you love best has had the Grace to repent of all his Evils has early seen his Errors and has thereby I hope freed  two  Persons from being one Day mutual Accusers of each other For now I please myself to think that the Crimes of both may be wash'd away in the Blood of that Saviour GOD whom both had so grievously offended  'May that good GOD who has not suffer'd me to be abandon'd intirely to my own Shame as  I deserved continue to shower down upon You those Blessings which a Virtue like yours may expect from his Mercy May you long be happy in the Possession of all you wish And late very late for the Good of Thousands I wish this may you receive the Reward of your Piety your Generosity and your filial your social and conjugal Virtues are the Prayers of  Your most unworthy Admirer and obliged humble Servant  SARAH WRIGHTSON  'Mr  Wrightson  begs your Acceptance of a small Present Part of which can have no Value but what its excelling Qualities for what it is will give it at so great a Distance as that dear  England  which I once left with so much Shame and Regret but with a laudable Purpose  however  because I would not incur still  greater  Shame and of Consequence give Cause for still  greater  Regret  To this Letter my dear Lady  Davers  I have written the following Answer which Mr  B  will take care to have convey'd to the good Lady  Dearest Madam  'I Embrace with great Pleasure the Opportunity you have so kindly given me of writing to a Lady whose Person tho' I have not the Honour to know yet whose Character and noble Qualities I truly revere  'I am infinitely obliged to you Madam for the precious Trust you have reposed in me and the Right you make over to me of your maternal  Interest in a Child on whom I set my Heart the Moment I saw her  'Lady  Davers  whose Love and Tenderness for Miss as well for her Mamma's sake as your late worthy Spouse's had from her kind Opinion of me consented to grant me this Favour and I was by Mr  B  's Leave in actual Possession of my pretty Ward about a Week before your kind Letter came to my Hands  'As I had been long very solicitous for this Favour judge how welcome your kind Concurrence was to me and the rather as had I known that a Letter from you was on the Way to me I should have apprehended that you had yielded to the Intreaties of your worthy Spouse and would have insisted upon depriving the surviving Friends of her dear Papa of the Pleasure they all take in the dear Miss Indeed Madam I believe we should one and all have join'd to disobey you had  that  been the Case and it is a very great Satisfaction to us that we are not under so hard a Necessity as the disputing with a tender Mamma the Enjoyment of her own Child would have been  'Assure yourself dearest worthiest kindest Madam of a Care and Tenderness in me to your dear Miss truly maternal and answerable as much as is in my Power to the Trust you repose in me The little Boy that GOD has given me shall not be more dear to me than my sweet Miss shall be and my Care by GOD's Grace shall extend to her  future  as well as her  present  Prospects that she may be worthy of that Piety and  truly  religious Excellence which I admire in your Character  'We all rejoice dear Madam in the Account you give of your present Happiness It was impossible  that GOD Almighty should desert a Lady so exemplarily deserving and HE certainly conducted you in your Resolutions to abandon every thing that you loved in  England  after the Loss of your dear Spouse because it seems to have been the Intention of His Providence that you should reward the Merit of Mr  Wrightson  and meet with your own Reward in so doing  'Miss is very fond of my little  Billy  She is a charming Child is easy and genteel in her Shape and very pretty she dances finely has a sweet Air and is improving every Day in Musick works with her Needle and reads admirably for her Years and takes a Delight in both which gives me no small Pleasure But she is not very forward in her Penmanship as you will see by what follows The inditing too is her own but in that and the Writing Miss took a good deal of Time on a separate Paper  Dearest dear Mamma  'YOur  Sally  is full of Joy to have any Commands from her honoured Mamma I promise to follow all your Directions Indeed and upon my Word I will You please me mightily in giving me so dear a new Mamma here Now I know indeed I have a Mamma and I will love and obey her as if she was you your own Self Indeed I will You must always bless me because I will be always good I hope you will believe me because I am above telling Fibs I am my honoured Mamma on the other Side of the Water and ever will be as if you was here  Your dutiful Daughter  SALLY GOODWIN  'Miss permit me dear Madam to subjoin is a very goodtemper'd Child easy to be persuaded and I hope loves me dearly and I will endeavour to make her love me better and better for on that Love will depend the Regard which I hope she will pay to all I shall say and do for her Good  'Repeating my Acknowlegements for the kind Trust you repose in me and with Thanks for the valuable Present you have sent me we all here join in Respects to worthy Mr  Wrightson  and in wishing you Madam a Continuance and Increase of worldly Felicity and I particularly beg Leave to assure you that I am and ever will be with the highest Respect and Gratitude tho' personally unknown dearest Madam  The affectionate Admirer of your Piety and your obliged humble Servant  P B  Your Ladyship will see how I was circumscrib'd and limited otherwise I would have told the good Lady what I have mention'd more than once how I admire and honour her for her Penitence and that noble Resolution which enabled her to do what Thousands could not have had the Heart to do abandon her Country her Relations Friends Baby and all that was dear to her as well as the wicked Seducer whom she too well loved and hazard the Sea the Dangers of Pirates and possibly of other wicked Attempters of the mischievous Sex in a World she knew nothing of among Strangers and all to avoid repeating a Sin she had been unhappily drawn into and for which the dear good Lady still abhors herself  Must not such a Lady as this dear Madam have as much Merit as many even of those who having not had her Temptations have not fallen This at least one may aver that next to not committing an Error is certainly the Resolution to retrieve it all that one may to repent of it and studiously to avoid the Repetition of it But who besides this excellent Mrs  Wrightson  having so fallen and being still so ardently solicited and pursued and flatter'd perhaps by fond Hopes that her Spoiler would one Day do her all the Justice he  could  For who can do complete Justice to a Lady he has robb'd of her Honour could resolve as she resolved and act as she acted  Miss is a sweet pretty Dear but permit me to say has a little of her Papa's Spirit hasty yet generous and acknowleging when she is convinc'd of her Fault a little haughtier and prouder than I wish her to be but in every thing else deserves the Character I give of her to her Mamma  She is very fond of fine Cloaths is a little too lively to the Servants Told me once when I took notice that Softness and Mildness of Speech became a young Lady That they were  but  Servants and she could say no more than  Pray  and  I desire  and  I wish you'd be so kind  to her Uncle or to me  I told her Our Servants were not common Servants and deserved any civil Distinctions and that so long as they were ready to oblige her in every thing by a kind Word it would be very wrong to give them imperative ones which could serve for no other End but to convince every one of the Haughtiness of one's own Temper and looked as if one would question their Compliance with one's own Will unless we would exact it with an high Hand which might cast a Slur upon the Command we gave as if we thought it was hardly so  reasonable as otherwise to obtain their Observation of it  Besides my Dear said I you don't consider that if you speak as haughtily and commandingly to them on common as on extraordinary Occasions you weaken your own Authority if ever you should be permitted to have any and they'll regard you no more in the one Case than in the other  She takes great Notice of what I say and when her little proud Heart is subdued by Reasonings she cannot answer she will sit as if she were studying what to say that she may come off as flyingly as she can And as the Case requires I let her off easily or I push the little Dear to her last Refuge and make her quit her Post and yield up her Spirit captive to Reason and Discretion two excellent Commanders with whom I tell her I must bring her to be intimately acquainted  Yet after all till I can be sure that I can inspire her with the Love of Virtue for  its own  Sake I will rather try to conduct her Spirit to proper Ends than endeavour totally to subdue it being sensible our Passions are given us for excellent Ends and may by a proper Direction be made subservient to the noblest Purposes  I tell her sometimes there is a decent Pride in Humility and that it is very possible for a young Lady to behave with so much  true  Dignity as shall command Respect by the Turn of her Eye sooner than by Asperity of Speech and that she may depend upon it that the Person who is always finding Faults frequently causes them and that it is no Glory to be better born than Servants if she is not better behav'd too  Besides I tell her Humility is a Grace that shines in an  high  Condition but cannot equally in a  low  one because that is already too much humbled perhaps  And that tho' there is a Censure lies against being  poor and proud  yet I would rather forgive Pride in a poor Body than in a rich for in the Rich it is Insult and Arrogance proceeding from their high Condition but in the Poor it may be a Defensative against Dishonesty and may shew a natural Bravery of Mind perhaps if properly directed and manifested on right Occasions that the Frowns of Fortune cannot depress  She says She hears every Day Things from me that her Governess never taught her  That may very well be I tell her because her Governess has  many  young Ladies to take care of I but  one  and that I want to make her wise and prudent betimes that she may be an Example to other Misses and that Governesses and Mamma's shall say to their Misses When will you be like Miss  Goodwin  Do you ever hear Miss  Goodwin  say a naughty Word Would Miss  Goodwin  think you have done so or so  She threw her Arms about my Neck on one such Occasion as this Oh said she What a charming Mamma have I got I will be in every thing as like you Madam as ever I can And then You will love me and so will my Uncle and Everybody else  Mr  B  whom nowandthen she says she loves as well as if he were her own Papa sees with Pleasure how we go on and loves us both if possible better and better But she tells me I must not have any Daughter but her▪ and is very jealous on the Occasion about which your Ladyship so kindly reproaches me  There is a Pride you know Madam in some of our Sex that serves to useful Purposes and is a good Defence against improper Matches and mean Actions and this is not wholly to be subdu'd for that  Reason for tho' it is not  Virtue  yet if it can be Virtue's  Substitute  in high rash and inconsiderate Minds it may turn to good Account So I will not quite discourage my dear Pupil neither till I see what Discretion and riper Years may add to her distinguishing Faculty For as some have no Notion of Pride separate from Imperiousness and Arrogance so others know no Difference between Humility and Meanness  There is a golden Mean in every thing and if it please God to spare us both I will endeavour to point her Passions and such even of those Foibles which seem too deeply rooted to be soon eradicated to useful Purposes chusing to imitate Physicians who in certain Chronical Illnesses as I have read in Lord  Bacon  rather proceed by Palliatives than by harsh Extirpatives which thro' the Resistance given to them by the Constitution may create such Ferments in it as may destroy that Health it was their Intention to establish  But whither am I running Your Ladyship I hope will excuse this parading Freedom of my Pen For tho' these Notions are well enough with regard to Miss  Goodwin  they must be very impertinent to a Lady who can so much better instruct Miss's Tutoress than that vain Tutoress can her Pupil And therefore with my humblest Respects to my good Lord  Davers  and your noble Neighbours and to Mr  H  I hasten to conclude myself  Your Ladyship's obliged Sister and obedient Servant  P B  Your  Billy  Madam is a charming Dear I long to have you see him He sends you a  Kiss upon this Paper You'll see it stain'd just here The Charmer has cut Two Teeth and is about more So you'll excuse the dear pretty slabbering Boy Miss  Goodwin  is ready to eat him with Love And Mr  B  is fonder and fonder of us all And then your Ladyship and my good Lord  Davers  love us too O my dear Lady what a blessed Creature am I  Miss begs I'll send her Duty to her  Noble  Uncle and Aunt that's her just Distinction always when she speaks of you both which is not seldom She ask'd me pretty Dear just now If I think there is such an happy Girl in the World as she is I tell her GOD always blesses good Misses and makes them happier and happier  LETTER XLIX  My dear Lady  Davers  I Have Three Marriages to acquaint you with in One Letter In the first Place Sir  W G  has sent by the particular Desire of my dear Friend that he was made one of the happiest Gentlemen in  England  on the th past and so I have no longer any Miss  Darnford  to boast of I have a very good Opinion of the Gentleman but if he be but half as good an Husband as she will make a Wife they will be exceedingly happy in one another  Mr  Williams  's Marriage to a Kinswoman of his Noble Patron as you have heard was in Treaty is the next and there is great Reason to believe from the Character of both that they will likewise do Credit to the State  The third is Mr  Adams  and  Polly Barlow  and I wish them for both their Sakes as happy as either of the former They are set out to his Living highly pleas'd with one another and I hope will have Reason to continue so to be  As to the first I did not indeed think the Affair would have been so soon concluded and Miss kept it off so long as I understand that her Papa was angry with her And indeed as the Gentleman's Family Circumstances and Character were such that there could lie no Objection against him I think it would have been wrong to have delay'd it  I should have written to your Ladyship before but have been favour'd with Mr  B's  Company into  Kent  on a Visit to my good Mother who was indispos'd We tarry'd there a Week and left both my dear Parents to my thankful Satisfaction in as good Health as ever they were in their Lives  Mrs  Judy Swynford  or Miss  Swynford  as she refuses not being call'd nowandthen has been with us for this Week past and she expects her Brother Sir  Jacob  to fetch her away about a Week hence  It does not become me to write the least Word that may appear disrespectful of any Person who has the Honour to bear a Relation to your Ladyship and Mr  B  Otherwise I should say That the  B's  and the  Ss  are directly the Opposites of one another But yet as she says she never saw your Ladyship but once you will forgive me to mention a Word or two about this Lady because she is a Character that is in a manner new to me  She is a Maiden Lady as you know Madam and tho' she will not part with the green Leaf from her Hand one sees by the Greygoose Down on her Brows and her Head that she cannot be less than Fiftyfive But so much Pains does she take  by Powder to have never a dark Hair in her Head because she has one Half of them white that I am sorry to see what is a Subject for Reverence should be deem'd by the good Lady Matter of Concealment  She is often in Conversation indeed seemingly reproaching herself that she is an  old Maid  and an  old Woman  but it is very discernible that she expects a Compliment that she is  not so  every time she is so free with herself And if nobody makes her one she will say something of that sort in her own Behalf  She takes particular Care that of all the publick Transactions which happen to be talked of her Memory will never carry her back above Thirty Years and then it is About Thirty Years ago when I was a Girl or when I was in Hangingsleeves and so she makes herself for Twenty Years of her Life a very useless and insignificant Person  If her Teeth which for her Time of Life are very good tho' not overwhite and which by the Care she takes of them she seems to look upon as the last Remains of her better Days would but fail her I imagine it would help her to a Conviction that would set her Ten Years forwarder at least But poor Lady she is so  young  in Spite of her Wrinkles that I am really concern'd for her Affectation because it exposes her to the Remarks and Ridicule of the Gentlemen and gives one Pain for her  Surely these Ladies don't act prudently at all since for every Year Mrs  Judy  would take from her Age her Censurers add two to it and behind her Back make her going on towards Seventy whereas if she would lay Claim to her  Reverentials  as I may say and not endeavour to conceal her Age she would have a great many Compliments for looking so well at her Time of Life  And many a young Body would hope to be the better for her Advice and Experience who now are afraid of affronting her if they suppose she has lived much longer in the World than themselves  Then she laughs back to the Years she owns when more flippant Ladies at the Laughingtime of Life delight to be frolick She tries to sing too altho' if ever she had a Voice she has outliv'd it and her Songs are of so antique a Date that they would betray her only as she tells us they were learnt her by her Grandmother who was a fine Lady at the Restoration She will join in a Dance and tho' her Limbs move not so pliantly as might be expected of a Lady no older than she would be thought to be and whose Dancingdays are not intirely over yet that was owing to a Fall from her Horse some Years ago which she doubts she shall never recover so as to be quite well tho' she finds she grows better and better  every Year    Thus she loses the Respect the Reverence she might receive were it not for this miserable Affectation takes Pains by aping Youth to make herself unworthy of her Years and even less valuably discreet than she would be thought for fear she should be imagined older if she appear'd wiser  What a sad Thing is this MadamWhat a mistaken ConductWe pray to live to old Age and it is promised as a Blessing and as a Reward for the Performance of certain Duties and yet when we come to it we had rather be thought as foolish as Youth than to be deemed wise and in Possession of it And so we shew how little we deserve what we have been so long coveting and yet covet on For what Why to be more and more asham'd and more and more unworthy of what we covet  How fantastick a Character is this Well may irreverent unthinking Youth despise instead of revering the hoary Head which the Wearer is so much asham'd of  Will you forgive me Madam The Lady boasts a Relationship to you and to Mr  B  and I think I am very bold But my Reverence for Years and the Disgust I have to see any Body behave unworthy of them makes me take the greater Liberty Which however I shall wish I had not taken if it meets not with that Allowance which I have always had from your Ladyship in what I write  God knows whether ever I may enjoy the Blessing I so much revere in others For now my heavy Time approaches But I was so apprehensive before and so troublesome to my best Friends with my vapourish Fears that now with a perfect Resignation to the Divine Will I will only add That I am  Your Ladyship's most obliged Sister and Servant  P B  My dear  Billy  and Miss  Goodwin  improve both of them every Day and are all I can desire or expect them to be Could Miss's poor Mamma be here with a Wish and back again how much would she be delighted with one of our Afternoon Conferences our  Sunday  Imployments especially And let me tell your Ladyship that I am very happy in another young Gentleman of the Dean's recommending instead of Mr  Adams    LETTER L  My dearest Lady  I AM once more blessed be God for all his Mercies to me enabled to dedicate to you the first Fruits of my Penmanship on my Upsitting  to thank you and my noble Lord for all your kind Solicitudes for my Welfare  Billy  every Day improves Miss is all I wish her to be and my second dear Boy continues to be as lovely and as fine a Baby as your Ladyship was pleased to think him and their Papa the best of Gentlemen and of Husbands  I am glad to hear Lady  Betty  is likely to be so happy Mr  B  says her noble Admirer is as worthy a Gentleman as the Peerage boasts and I beg of your Ladyship to congratulate the dear Lady and her noble Parents in my Name if I should be at a Distance when the Nuptials are celebrated  I have had the Honour of a Visit from my Lady the Countess Dowager on Occasion of her leaving the Kingdom for one Year for which Space she designs to reside in  Italy  principally at  Naples  or  Florence    Mr  B  was abroad when her Ladyship came having taken a Turn to  Gloucester  the Day before and I expected him not till the next Day Her Ladyship sent her Gentleman the preceding Evening to let me know that Business had brought her as far as  Wooburn  and if it would not be unacceptable she would pay her Respects to me at Breakfast the next Morning being speedily to leave  England  I return'd that I should be very proud of that Honour And about Ten her Ladyship came  She was exceedingly fond of my two Boys the little Man and the pretty Baby as she called them and I had very different Emotions from the Expression of her Love to them and her Visit to me from what I had once before She was sorry she said Mr  B  was abroad tho' her Business was principally with me For Mrs  B  said she I come to tell you all that pass'd between Mr  B  and myself that you may not think worse of either of us than  we deserve and I could not leave  England  till I had done myself the Pleasure of waiting on you for this Purpose  I said I was very sorry I had ever been uneasy when I had two Persons of so much Honour Nay said she interrupting me you have no need to apologize Things look'd bad enough as they were represented to you to justify greater Uneasiness than you express'd  She ask'd me Who that pretty genteel Miss was I said a Relation of Lord  Davers  who was intrusted lately to my Care Then Miss said her Ladyship and kissed her you are very happy  Believing the Countess was desirous of being alone with me I said My dear Miss  Goodwin  won't you go to your little Nursery my Love For so she calls my last Blessing You'd be sorry the Baby should cry for you For Miss was so taken with the charming Lady that she was loth to leave us But on my saying this withdrew  When we were alone the Countess began her Story with a sweet Confusion that added to her Loveliness She said She would be brief because she should exact all my Attention and not suffer me to interrupt her till she had done  She began with acknowleging  "That she thought when she saw Mr  B  first at the Masquerade that he was the finest Gentleman she had ever seen that the allow'd Freedoms of the Place had made her take Liberties in following him and engaging him whereever he went She blamed him very freely for passing for a single Gentleman for that she said as she had so splendid a Fortune of her own was all she was solicitous about having never as she confess'd seen a Gentleman she could like so well her former Marriage having been in  some sort forced upon her at an Age when she knew not how to distinguish and that she was very loth to believe him marry'd even when she had no Reason to doubt it Yet this I must say Madam said her Ladyship I never heard a Gentleman when he owned he was married express himself of a Lady with more affectionate Regard and Fondness than he when he spoke of you to me which made me long to see you For I had a great Opinion of those personal Advantages which every one flatter'd me with And I was very unwilling to yield the Palm of Beauty to you  "I believe you will censure me Mrs  B  said she for permitting his Visits after I knew how happy he was in such a Lady these were her Words To be sure that was a thoughtless and a faulty Conduct in me But the World's saucy Censures and my Friends indiscreet Interposals incensed me and knowing the Uprightness of my own Heart I was resolved to disregard both when I found they could not think worse of me than they did  "I am naturally said she of a haughty Spirit impatient of Contradiction always gave myself Freedoms for which satisfy'd with my own Innocence and Honour I thought myself above being accountable to any body And then Mr  B  has such noble Sentiments a Courage and Fearlessness which I saw on more Occasions than one that all Ladies who know the Weakness of their own Sex and how much they want the Protection of the Brave are taken with Then his personal Address was so peculiarly distinguishing that having an Opinion of his Honour I was imbarass'd greatly how to deny myself his Conversation altho' you'll pardon me Mrs  B  I began to be afraid  that my Honour might suffer in the World's Opinion for the Indulgence  "Then said she when I had resolv'd as several times was the Case to see him no more some unforeseen Accident threw him in my way again at one publick Entertainment or other for I love Balls and Concerts and publick Diversions perhaps better than I ought and I had all my Resolves to begin again  "Yet this said she I can truly say whatever his Views were I never heard from his Lips the least indecent Expression nor saw in his Behaviour to me aught that might make me very apprehensive saving that I began to fear that by his insinuating Address and noble Manner I should be too much in his Power and too little in my own if I went on so little doubting and so little alarm'd if ever he should pull off the Mask and avow dishonourable Designs  "I had often lamented said her Ladyship that our Sex were prohibited by the Designs of the other upon their Honour and by the World's Censures from conversing with the same Ease and Freedom with Gentlemen as with one another And when once I asked myself To what this Conversation might tend at last And where the Pleasure each seem'd to take in the other's might possibly end I resolv'd to break it off and told him my Resolution next time I saw him But he stopp'd my Mouth with a romantick Notion as I since think it tho' a sorry Plea will have Weight in favour of a Proposal one has no Aversion to of  Platonick  Love and we had an Intercourse by Letters to the Number of Six or Eight I believe on that and other Subjects  "All this time I was the less apprehensive continued her Ladyship because he always spoke so  tenderly and even with Delight whenever he mention'd his Lady and I could not find that you were at all alarm'd at our Acquaintance for I never scrupled to send my Letters by my own Livery to your House sealed with my own Seal  "At last indeed he began to tell me that from the sweetest and the evenest Temper in the World you seem'd to be leaning towards Melancholy were always in Tears or shew'd you had been weeping when he came home and that you did not make his Return to you so agreeable as he used to find it  "I asked If it was not owing to some Alteration in his own Temper If you might not be uneasy at our Acquaintance And at his frequent Absence from you and the like He answer'd No that you were above Disguises were of a noble and frank Nature and would have taken some Opportunity to hint it to him if you had  "This however gave me but little Satisfaction and I began to think seriously of the Matter and was more and more convinced that my Honour requir'd it of me to break off this Intimacy  "And altho' I permitted Mr  B  to go with me to  Tunbridge  when I went to take a House there yet I was uneasy as he saw And indeed so was he tho' he tarry'd a Day or two longer than he designed on account of a little Excursion my Sister and her Lord and he and I made into  Sussex  to see an Estate that I had Thoughts of purchasing for he was so good as to look into my Affairs for me and has put them upon an admirable Establishment  "His Uneasiness he told me was upon your Account and he sent you a Letter to excuse himself for not waiting on you on  Saturday  and  to tell you he would dine with you on  Monday  And I remember when I said Mr  B  you seem to be chagrin'd at something you are more thoughtful than usual his Answer wasMadam you are right Mrs  B  and I have had a little Misunderstanding She is so solemn and so melancholy of late that I fear it will be too easy a Matter to put her out of her right Mind And I love her so well that then I should hardly keep my own  "Is there no Reason think you said I continu'd the Countess to imagine that your Acquaintance and mine gives her Uneasiness You know Mr  B  how that Villain  T  a Gentleman said she whose insolent Address I rejected with the Contempt it deserv'd has slander'd us How know you but he has found a way to your Wife's Ear as he has done to my Uncle's and to all my Friends And if so it is best for us both to discontinue a Friendship that may be attended with disagreeable Consequences  "He said he should find it out on his Return to you And will you said I ingenuously acquaint me with the Issue of your Inquiries for added I I never beheld a Countenance in so young a Lady that seem'd to mean more than Mrs  B  's when I saw you in Town and notwithstanding her Prudence I could see a Reserve and Thoughtfulness in it that if it was not natural to it must indicate too much  "He return'd to you Madam He wrote to me in a very moving Letter the Issue of your Conference and referred to some Papers of yours that he would shew me as soon as he could procure them they being out of your own Hands and let me know that  T  was the Accuser as I had suspected  "In brief Madam when you went down into  Kent  he came to me and read some Part of your Account to Lady  Davers  of your Informant and Information your Apprehensions your Prudence your Affection for him the Reason of your Melancholy and according to the Appearance Things bore Reason enough you had especially from the Letter of  Thomasine Fuller  which was one of  T  's vile Forgeries For tho' we had often for Argument's sake talked of Polygamy he arguing for it I against it yet had not Mr  B dared  I will say nor was he inclined I verily believe to propose any such thing to me No Madam I was not so much abandon'd of a Sense of Honour as to give Reason for any one but my impertinent and foolish Uncle to impute such a Folly to me and he had so behaved to me that I cared not what  he  thought"  "Then what he read to me here and there as he pleased gave me Reason to admire you for your generous Opinion of one you had so much seeming Cause to be afraid of He told me his Apprehensions from your uncommon Manner that your Mind was in some Degree affected and your strange Proposal of parting with an Husband every one knows you so dearly love And we agreed to forbear seeing each other and all manner of Correspondence except the latter for one Month by Letter till some of my Affairs were settled which had been in great Disorder and were in his kind Management then and I had not one Relation whom I car'd to trouble with them because of their Treatment of me on Mr  B  's account And this I told him should not be neither but thro' your Hands and with your Consent  "And thus Madam said her Ladyship have I "told you the naked Truth of the whole Affair  "I have seen Mr  B  but once since and that at an Horserace in the open Field  "I respect him greatly you must allow me to say that Except in the Article of permitting me to believe for some Time that he was a single Gentleman which is a Fault he cannot be excused for and which made me heartily quarrel with him when I first knew it he has always behaved towards me with so much Generosity and Honour that I could have wish'd I had been of his Sex since he has a Lady so much more deserving than myself and never would there have been then had he had the same Esteem for me a more perfect Friendship  "I am now going continu'd her Ladyship to embark for  France  and shall pass a Year in  Italy  and then I shall I hope return as solid as grave as circumspect tho' not so wise as Mrs  B  "  In this manner the Countess concluded her Narrative and I told her That I was greatly obliged to her Ladyship for the Honour she did me in this Visit and the kind and considerate Occasion of it But that Mr  B  had made me intirely happy in every Particular and had done her Ladyship the Justice she so well deserv'd having taken upon himself the Blame of passing as a single Gentleman at his first Acquaintance with her Ladyship  I added That I could hope her Ladyship might be prevented by some happy Gentleman from leaving a Kingdom to which she was so great an Ornament as well by her Birth her Quality and Fortune as by her Perfections of Person and Mind  She said She had not been the happiest of her Sex in her former Marriage altho' nobody her Youth  consider'd thought her a bad Wife and her Lord's Goodness to her at his Death had demonstrated his own favourable Opinion of her by Deeds as he had done by Words upon all Occasions But that she was yet young a little too gay and unsettled and had her Head turn'd towards  France  and  Italy  for one Tour of a Year at least having pass'd some Time in those Countries which she thought of with Pleasure tho' then but a Girl of Twelve or Thirteen That for this Reason and having been on a late Occasion still more unsettled looking down with Blushes which often overspread her lovely Face as she talked she had refused some Offers not despisable That indeed Lord  C  threatened to follow her to  Italy  in hopes of meeting better Success there but if he did tho' she would make no Resolutions she believ'd she should be too much offended with him to give him Reason to boast of his Journey  She wish'd to see Mr  B  and to take Leave of him but not out of my Company she was pleased to say Your Ladyship's Consideration for me reply'd I lays me under high Obligation but indeed Madam there is no Occasion for it from any Diffidences I have in yours or Mr  B  's Honour And if your Ladyship will give me the Pleasure of knowing when it will be most acceptable I will beg of Mr  B  to oblige me with his Company to return this Favour the first Visit I make abroad  You are very kind my dear Mrs  B  said she But I think to go to  Tunbridge  for a Fortnight when I have disposed of every thing for my Imbarkation and so set out from thence And if you should then be both in  Kent  I should be glad to take you at your Word  To be sure I said Mr  B  at least would attend her Ladyship there if any thing should happen to deprive me of that Honour and if it would be  agreeable to her Ladyship I made no doubt he would with as high a Pleasure as I should receive in his doing so attend her Ladyship on board and see her safe on the other Side  You are a generous Lady said the Countess I take great Concern to myself for having been the Means of giving you a Moment's Uneasiness formerly But I must now endeavour to be circumspect in order to retrieve my Character which has been so basely traduc'd by that presumptuous Fellow  Turner  that was her Word who hoped I suppose thereby to bring me down to his Level  Her Ladyship would not be prevailed upon to stay Dinner and saying She should be at  Wooburn  all the next Day took a very kind and tender Leave of me wishing me all manner of Happiness as I did her  Mr  B  came home in the Evening and next Morning rode to  Wooburn  to pay his Respects to the Countess and came back in the Evening Thus happily and to the Satisfaction of all Three as I hope ended this perplexing Affair  Mr  B  asks me Madam How I relish Mr  Locke  's  Treatise of Education  which he put into my Hands some time since as I told your Ladyship I answer'd Very well and I thought it an excellent Piece in the main  I'll tell you said he what you shall do You have not shew'd me any thing you have written for a good while I would be glad you would fill up your Leisuretime as you cannot be without Pen and Ink with your Observations on that Treatise that I may know what you can object to it for you say  In the main  which shews that you do not intirely approve of every Part of it  But will not that be presumptuous Sir  I admire Mr  Locke  reply'd he and I admire my  Pamela  I have no Doubt of his Excellencies  but I want to know the Sentiments of a young Mother as well as of a learned Gentleman upon the Subject of Education because I have heard several Ladies censure some Part of his Regimen when I am convinc'd that the Fault lies in their own overgreat Fondness for their Children  As to myself Sir said I who in the early Part of my Life have not been brought up too tenderly you will hardly meet with any Objection to the Part which I imagine you have heard most objected to by Ladies who have been more indulgently treated in their first Stage But there are a few other Things that want clearing up to my Understanding but which however may be the Fault of that  Then my Dear suppose me at a Distance from you cannot you give me your Remarks in the same manner as if you were writing to Lady  Davers  or Miss  Darnford  that was  Yes Sir depending on your kind Favour to me I believe I could  Do then return'd he and the less Restraint you write with the more I shall be pleased with it But I confine you not to Time or Place We will make our Excursions as I once proposed to you and do you write me a Letter nowandthen upon the Subject for the Places and Remarkables you will see will be new only to yourself nor will either of those Ladies expect from you an Itinerary or a particular Description of Countries which they will find better described by Authors who have made it their Business to treat upon those Subjects By this Means you will be usefully imploy'd in your own way which may turn to good Account to us both and to the dear Children which it may please God to bestow upon us  You don't expect Sir any thing regular or digested from me  I don't my Dear Let your Fancy and your Judgment be both imploy'd and I require no Method for I know in your easy natural way that would be a Confinement that would cramp your Genius and give what you write a stiff formal Air that I might expect in a Pedagogue but not in my  Pamela    Well but Sir said I altho' I may write nothing to the Purpose yet if Lady  Davers  is desirous to give it a Reading will you allow me to transmit what I shall write to her Hands when you have perus'd it yourself For your good Sister is so indulgent to my Scribble that she will expect to be always hearing from me and this way I shall oblige her Ladyship while I obey her dear Brother  With all my Heart he was pleased to say  So my Lady I shall nowandthen pay my Respects to you in the writing way tho' I must address myself it seems to my dearest Mr  B  and I hope I shall be received on these my own Terms since they are your Brother's Terms also and at the same time such as will convince you how much I wish to approve myself to the best of my poor Ability  Your Ladyship's most obliged Sister and humble Servant  P B  LETTER LI  My dearest Mr  B  I HAVE been considering of your Commands in relation to Mr  Locke  's Book and as you are pleas'd to give me Time to acquit myself of the Task I shall take the Liberty to propose to include in a little Book my humble Sentiments as I did to  Lady  Davers  in that I shew'd you in relation to the Plays I had seen And since you confine me not to Time or Place perhaps I shall be three or four Years in completing it because I shall reserve some Subjects to my further Experience in Childrens Ways and Tempers and in order to benefit myself by those good Lessons and Instructions which I shall receive from your delightful Conversation in that Compass of Time if God spare us to one another And then it will moreover be more worthy than it can otherwise be of the Perusal of the most honour'd and bestbeloved of all my Correspondents much honour'd and beloved as they all are  I must needs say my dear Mr  B  that this is a Subject to which I was always particularly attentive and among the Charities your bountiful Heart permits me to dispense to the Poor and Indigent I have had always a watchful Eye upon the Children of such and endeavour'd by Questions put to them as well as to their Parents to inform myself of their little Ways and Tempers and how Nature delights to work in different Minds and how it might be pointed to their Good according to their respective Capacities and I have for this Purpose erected with your Approbation a little School of Seven or Eight Children among which are Four in the earliest Stages when they can but just speak and call for what they want or love And I am not a little pleas'd to observe when I visit them in their Schooltime that Principles of Goodness and Virtue may be instill'd into their little Hearts much earlier than is usually imagin'd And why should it not be so For may not the Child that can tell its Wants and make known its Inclination be easily made sensible of  yours  and what you expect from it provided you take a proper Method For sometimes  Signs and Tokens and even Looks uniformly practis'd will do as well as Words as we see in such of the Young of the Brute Creation as we are dispos'd to domesticate and to teach to practise those little Tricks of which the Aptness or Docility of their Natures makes them capable  But yet dearest Sir I know not enough of the next Stage or the  maturer  Life to touch upon that as I wish to do and yet there is a natural Connection and Progression from the one to the other And I would not be thought a vain Creature who believes herself equal to  every  Subject because she is indulg'd with the good Opinions of her Friends in a  few  that are supposed to be within her own Capacity For  I humbly conceive that it is no small Point of Wisdom to know and not to mistake one's own Talents and for this Reason permit me dear Sir to suspend till I am better qualify'd for it even my own Proposal of beginning my little Book and in the mean time to touch upon a few Places of the admirable Author you have put into my Hand that seem to me to warrant another way of Thinking than that which he prescribes  But dear Sir let me premise that all that your dear Babies can demand of my Attention for some time to come is their Health and it has pleas'd God to bless them with such sound Limbs and to all Appearance good Constitutions that I have very little to do but to pray for them every time I pray for their dear Papa and that is hourly and yet not so often as you confer upon me Benefits and Favours and new Obligations even to the Prevention of all my Wishes were I to sit down to study for what must be the next  As to this Point of  Health  Mr  Locke  gives these plain and easy to be observed Rules  He prescribes First  Plenty of open Air  That this is right the Infant will inform one who tho' it cannot speak will make Signs to be carry'd abroad and is never so well pleas'd as when it is enjoying the open and free Air for which Reason I conclude that this is one of those natural Pointings as one may call it that is implanted in every Creature teaching it to chuse its Good and to avoid its Evil  Sleep  is the next which he injoins to be indulg'd to its utmost Extent An admirable Rule as I humbly conceive since sound Sleep is one of the greatest Nourishers in Nature both to the  once  Young and to the  twice  Young if I may so phrase it And I the rather approve this Rule to Children because it keeps the Nurse unimploy'd who otherwise perhaps would be doing it the greatest Mischief by cramming and stuffing its little Bowels till they were ready to burst And if I am right what an inconsiderate and foolish as well as pernicious Practice is it for a Nurse to  waken  the Child from its nourishing Sleep for fear it should suffer by Hunger and instantly pop the Breast into its pretty Mouth or provoke it to feed when it has no Inclination to either and for want of Digestion must have its Nutriment turn to Repletion and bad Humours  Excuse me dear Sir these lesser Particulars Mr  Locke  begins with them and surely they may be allow'd to a young  Mamma  writing however it be to a Gentleman of Genius and Learning to a  Papa  on a Subject that in its lowest Beginnings ought not to be unattended to by either I will therefore pursue my excellent Author without further Apology since you have put his Work into my Hands  The next Thing then which he prescribes is  plain Diet  This speaks for itself for the Baby can  have no corrupt Taste to gratify All is pure as out of the Hand of Nature and what is not plain and natural must vitiate and offend  Then  no Wine  or  strong Drink  Equally just and for the same Reasons  Little  or  no Physick  Undoubtedly right For the  Use  of Physick without Necessity or by way of  Precaution  as some call it begets the  Necessity  of Physick and the very  Word  supposes  Distemper  or  Disorder  and where there is none would a Parent beget one or render its salutary Force ineffectual by frequent Use when it was wanted  Next he forbids  too warm  and  too streight Cloathing  Dear Sir this is just as I wish it How has my Heart ached many and many a time when I have seen poor Babies roll'd and swath'd ten or a dozen times round then Blanket upon Blanket Mantle upon that its little Neck pinn'd down to one Posture its Head more than it frequently needs triplecrown'd like a young Pope with Covering upon Covering its Legs and Arms as if to prevent that kindly Stretching which we rather ought to promote when it is in Health and is aiming at Growth and Inlargement the former bundled up the latter pinn'd down and how the poor Thing lies on the Nurse's Lap a miserable little pinion'd Captive goggling and staring with its Eyes the only Organs it has at Liberty as if it was supplicating for Freedom to its fetter'd Limbs Nor has it any Comfort at all till with a Sigh or two like a dying Deer it drops asleep and happy then will it be till the officious Nurse's Care shall awaken it for its undesired Food just as if the good Woman were resolv'd to try its Constitution and were willing to see how many Difficulties it could overcome  Then this Gentleman advises that the Head and Feet should be kept cold and the latter often us'd  to cold Water and expos'd to Wet in order to lay the Foundation as he says of an healthy and hardy Constitution  Now Sir what a Pleasure is it to your Girl that her Notions and her Practice too fall in so exactly with this learned Gentleman's Advice that excepting one Article which is that your  Billy  has not yet been accustom'd to be  wetshed  every other Particular has been observ'dAnd don't you see what a charming charming Baby he isNay and so is your little  Davers  for his Agepretty Soul  Perhaps some were they to see this would not be so ready as I know you will be to excuse me and would be apt to say What Nursery Impertinencies are these to trouble a Man withBut with all their Wisdom they would be mistaken for if a Child has not good Health and are not these Rules the moral Foundation as I may say of that Blessing its animal Organs will play but poorly in a weak or crasy Case These therefore are necessary Rules to be observed for the first two or three Years for then the little Buds of their Minds will begin to open and their watchful Mamma will be imploy'd like a skilful Gardener in assisting and encouraging the charming Flower thro' its several hopeful Stages to Perfection when it shall become one of the principal Ornaments of that delicate Garden your honour'd Family Pardon me Sir if in the above Paragraph I am too figurative I begin to be afraid I am out of my Sphere writing to your dear Self on these important Subjects  But be that as it may I will here put an End to this my first Letter on the earliest Part of my Subject rejoicing in the Opportunity you have given me of producing a fresh Instance of that Duty and Affection wherewith I am and shall ever be my dearest Mr  B  Your gratefully happy  P B  LETTER LII  I WILL now my dearest my bestbeloved Correspondent of all begin since the tender Age of my dear Babies will not permit me to have an Eye yet to their  better  Part to tell you what are the little Matters to which I am not quite so well reconcil'd in Mr  Locke  And this I shall be better inabled to do by my Observations upon the Temper and natural Bent of my dear Miss  Goodwin  as well as by those which the Visits I make nowandthen to the bigger Children of my little School and those at the Cottages adjacent have enabled me to form For human Nature Sir you are not to be told is human Nature whether in the Highborn or in the Low  This excellent Author in his Fiftysecond Section having justly disallow'd of slavish and corporal Punishments in the Education of those we would have to be wise good and ingenious Men adds  "On the other Side to flatter Children by Rewards of Things that are pleasant to them is as carefully to be avoided He that will give his Son Apples or Sugarplums or what else of this kind he is most delighted with to make him learn his Book does but authorize his Love of Pleasure and cockers up that dangerous Propensity which he ought by all means to subdue and stifle in him You can never hope to teach him to master it whilst you compound for the Check you give his Inclination in one Place by the Satisfaction you propose to it in another To make a good a wise and a virtuous Man 'tis fit he should learn to cross his Appetite and deny his Inclination to Riches Finery or pleasing his Palate  c  "  This Sir is excellently said but is it not a little too philosophical and abstracted not only for the Generality of Children but for the Age he supposes them to be of if one may guess by the Apples and the Sugarplums proposed for the Rewards of their Welldoing Would not this Sir require in Children that Memory and Reflection which the same Author in another Place calls the Concomitant of Prudence and Age and not of Childhood  It is undoubtedly very right to check an unreasonable Appetite and that at its first Appearance But if so small and so reasonable an Inducement will prevail surely Sir it might be comply'd with A generous Mind takes Delight to win over others by good Usage and Mildness rather than by Severity and it must be a great Pain to such an one to be always inculcating on his Children or Pupils the Doctrine of Selfdenial by Methods quite grievous to his own Nature  What I would then humbly propose is That the Encouragements offer'd to Youth should indeed be innocent ones as the Gentleman injoins and not such as would lead to Luxury either of Food or Apparel But I humbly think it necessary that Rewards  proper  Rewards should be propos'd as Incentives to laudable Actions For is it not by this Method that the whole World is influenc'd and govern'd Does not GOD himself by Rewards and Punishments make it our  Interest  as well as our  Duty  to obey HIM And can we propose to ourselves for the Government of our Children a better Example than that of the Almighty  This fine Author seems dear Sir to think he had been a little of the strictest and liable to some Exception "I say not this" proceeds he §  "that I would have Children kept from the Conveniencies or Pleasures of Life that are not injurious to their Health or Virtue On the contrary  I would have their Lives made as pleasant and as agreeable to them as may be in a plentiful Enjoyment of whatsoever might innocently delight them"  And yet dear Sir he immediately subjoins a very hard and difficult Proviso to the Indulgence he has just granted  "Provided" says he "it be with this Caution That they have those Enjoyments only as the Consequences of the State of Esteem and Acceptation they are in with their Parents and Governors"  I doubt my dear Mr  B  this is expecting such a Distinction and Discretion in Children as they are seldom capable of in their tender Years and requiring such Capacities as are not commonly to be met with So that it is not prescribing to the  Generality  as this excellent Author intended 'Tis I humbly conceive next to impossible that their tender Minds should distinguish beyond Facts They covet this or that Plaything and have no other Motive than being gratify'd in the Possession of what they desire The Parent or Governor has another Motive in obliging the Child He takes Advantage of its Desires and annexes to the Indulgence which the Child hopes for such or such a Task or Duty as a Condition and shews himself pleas'd with its Compliance with it So the Child wins its Plaything and receives the Praise and Commendation so necessary to lead on young Minds to laudable Pursuits But dear Sir shall it not be suffer'd to enjoy the innocent Reward of its Compliance unless it can give Satisfaction that its greatest Delight is not in having the Thing coveted but in performing the Task or obeying the Injunctions impos'd upon it as a Condition of its being oblig'd I doubt Sir this is a little too strict and not to be expected from Children A Servant fullgrown would not be able to shew one that on Condition he comply'd with such and such  Terms which it is to be suppos'd by the  Offer  he would not have comply'd with but for that Inducement that he should have such and such a Reward I say he would hardly be able to shew one that he preferr'd the Pleasure of performing the requisite Conditions to the stipulated Reward How then is it to be expected from a Child who is less capable of distinguishing  Let therefore if Sir I may presume to say so innocent Rewards be propos'd and let us be contented to lead on the ductile Minds of Children to a Love of their Duty by obliging them with such We may tell them what we  expect  in this Case but we ought not I humbly conceive to be too rigorous in  exacting  it for after all the Inducement will certainly be the uppermost Consideration with the Child 'Tis out of Nature to suppose it otherwise nor had it been offer'd to it if the Parent himself had not thought so And therefore we can only let the Child know his Duty in this respect and that he  ought  to give a Preference to that and then rest ourselves contented altho' we should discern that the Reward is the chief Incentive if it do but oblige to the Performance of it For this from whatever Motive inculcated may beget a Habit in the Child of doing it and then as it improves in Years one may hope that Reason will take place and enable him from the most solid and durable Motives to give a Preference to the Duty  Upon the Whole then may I Sir venture to say That we should not insist upon it that the Child should so nicely distinguish away its little  innate  Passions as if we expected it to be born a Philosopher Selfdenial is indeed a most excellent Doctrine to be inculcated in Children and it must be done  early  too But we must not be too severe in our exacting it for a Duty too rigidly insisted upon will make  it odious This Mr  Locke  himself excellently observes in another Place on the Head of too great Severity which he illustrates by a familiar Comparison "Offensive Circumstances" says he  "ordinarily infect innocent Things which they are joined with And the very Sight of a Cup wherein any one uses to take nauseous Physick turns his Stomach so that nothing will relish well out of it tho' the Cup be never so clean and wellshap'd and of the richest Materials"  Permit me dear Sir to add That Mr  Locke  proceeds to explain himself still more rigorously on the Subject of Rewards which I quote to shew I have not misunderstood him "But these Enjoyments" says he  "should  never  be offer'd or bestow'd on Children as the Rewards of this or that particular Performance that they shew an Aversion to or to which they would not have apply'd themselves without that Temptation"  If my dear Mr  B  the Minds of Children  can  be led on by innocent Inducements to the Performance of a Duty of which they are capable what I have humbly offer'd is enough I presume to convince one that it  may  be done But if ever a particular Study be propos'd to be master'd or a Byas to be overcome that is not an  indispensable  Requisite to his future Life or Morals to which the Child shews an Aversion I would not methinks have him be too much tempted or compell'd to conquer or subdue it especially if it appear to be a  natural  or rivetted Aversion  For Sir permit me to observe That the Education and Studies of Children ought as much as possible to be suited to their Capacities and Inclinations And by this means we may expect to have always  useful  and often  great  Men in different Professions For that Genius that will not take to  one Study may shine in another no less necessary Part of Science But if innocent the Promise of innocent Rewards will conquer this  Aversion  as it is call'd it will then hardly bear that Name and let them by all means if I may presume to say so be propos'd for their Encouragement Nevertheless I must repeat that if as the Child grows up and is capable of so much Reason that from the Love of the  Inducement  one can raise his Mind to the Love of the  Duty  it should be done by all means But my dear Mr  B  I am afraid that  that  Parent or Tutor will meet but with little Success who in a Child's  tender  Years shall refuse to comply with its Foibles till he sees it values its Duty and the Pleasure of obeying its Commands beyond the little Enjoyment on which its Heart is fixed For as I humbly conceive that Mind which can be brought to prefer its Duty to its Appetites will want little of the Perfection of the wisest Philosophers  Besides Sir permit me to say That I am afraid this perpetual Opposition between the Passions of the Child and the Duty to be inforced especially when he sees how other Children are indulg'd for if this Regimen could be observ'd by  any  it would be impossible it should become  general  while the fond and the inconsiderate Parents are so large a Part of Mankind will cow and dispirit a Child and will perhaps produce a Necessity of making use of Severity to subdue him to this Temper of Selfdenial for if the Child refuses the Parent  must  insist and what will be the Consequence Must it not introduce a harsher Discipline than this Gentleman allows ofAnd which I presume to say did never yet do Good to any but to slavish and base Spirits if to them A Discipline which Mr  Locke  everywhere justly condemns  See here dear Sir a Specimen of the Presumption of your Girl What will she come to in time you will perhaps sayHer next Step will be to arraign myselfNo no dear Sir don't think so For my Duty my Love and my Reverence shall be your Guards and defend you from every thing saucy in me but the bold Approaches of my Gratitude which shall always testify for me how much I am  Your obliged and dutiful  P B  LETTER LIII  My dearest Mr  B  I WILL continue my Subject altho' I have not had an Opportunity to know whether you approve of my Notions or not by reason of the Excursions you have been pleas'd to allow me to make in your beloved Company to the Seaports of this Kingdom and to the more noted inland Towns of  Essex Kent Sussex Hampshire  and  Dorsetshire  which have given me infinite Delight and Pleasure and inlarg'd my Notions of the Wealth and Power of the Kingdom in which God's Goodness has given you so considerable a Stake  My next Topick will be upon an Home Education which Mr  Locke  prefers for several weighty Reasons to a School one provided such a Tutor can be procur'd as he makes next to an Impossibility to procure The Gentleman has set forth the Inconveniencies of both and was himself so discourag'd on a Review of them that he was ready as he says to throw up his Pen My chief Cares dear Sir on this Head are threefold  st  The Difficulty which as I said Mr  Locke  makes almost insuperable  to find a Tutor qualify'd  dly  The Necessity there is according to Mr  Locke  of keeping the Youth out of the Company of the meaner Servants who may set him bad Examples And next Those still greater Difficulties which will arise from the Examples of his Parents if they are not very discreet and circumspect  As to the Qualifications of the Tutor Mr  Locke  supposes that he is to be so learned so discreet so wise in short so  perfect  a Man that I doubt and so does Mr  Locke  such an one is hardly possible to be met with for this  humble  and  slavish  Imployment I presume Sir to call it so because of the too little Regard that is generally paid to these useful Men in the Families of the Great where they are too frequently put upon a Foot with the uppermost Servants and the rather if they happen to be Men of Modesty  "I would" says this Gentleman  "from Childrens first beginning to talk have some discreet sober nay  wise  Person about them whose Care it should be to fashion them right and to keep them from all Ill especially the Infection of bad Company"  I think" continues he  "this Province requires great Sobriety Temperance Tenderness Diligence and Discretion Qualities hardly to be found united in Persons that are to be had for ordinary Salaries nor easily to be found anywhere"  If this Sir be the Case does not this excellent Author recommend a Scheme that is render'd in a manner impracticable from this Difficulty  As to these Qualities being more rarely to be met with in Persons that are to be had for  ordinary Salaries  I cannot help being of Opinion altho' with Mr  Locke  I think no Expence should be spared if that  would  do that there is as good a Chance of  finding such an one among the needy Scholars as among those better provided for Because the Necessities of the former as they became a Spur to his own Learning and Improvement so will they at first setting out in the World quicken his Diligence and in Hopes of recommending him to a worthier Lot make him be glad of embracing an Offer of this kind in a Family which has Interest enough to prefer him  I say not this dear Sir to encourage that wretched Niggardliness which this Gentleman justly censures of those who grudge an handsome Consideration to so necessary and painful a Labour as that of a Tutor which where a deserving Man can be met with cannot be too genteelly rewarded nor himself too respectfully treated I only take the Liberty to deliver my Opinion that an humble Condition is as likely as any other to produce a Gentleman of these good Qualities as well for the Reason I have hinted at as for others which might be mention'd To which to name no more the Merit of Mr  Williams  and Mr  Adams  will bear Witness  But Mr  Locke  proceeds with his Difficulties in this Particular  "To form a young Gentleman as he should be"  says he  "'tis fit his Governor should be wellbred understand the Ways of Carriage and Measures of Civility in all the Variety of  Persons Times  and  Places  and keep his Pupil as far as his Age requires constantly to the Observation of them This is an Art"  continues he  "not to be learnt or taught by Books Nothing can give it but good Company and Observation join'd together"  And in another Place  "Besides being wellbred the Tutor should know the World well the Ways the Humours the Follies the Cheats the Faults of the Age he is fallen into and particularly of  the Country he lives in These he should be able to shew to his Pupil as he finds him capable teach him Skill in Men and their Manners pull off the Mask which their several Callings and Pretences cover them with and make his Pupil discern what lies at the Bottom under such Appearances that he may not as unexperienc'd young Men are apt to do if they are unwarn'd take one thing for another judge by the Outsides and give himself up to Shew and the Insinuation of a fair Carriage or an obliging Application Teach him to guess at and beware of the Designs of Men he hath to do with neither with too much Suspicion nor too much Confidence"  This dear Sir is excellently said 'Tis noble  Theory  And if the Tutor is a Man void of Resentment and Caprice and will not be govern'd by partial Considerations in his own Judgment of Persons and Things it will be well But if otherwise he may take Advantage of the Confidence plac'd in him to the Injury of some worthy Person and by Degrees monopolize the young Gentleman to himself and govern his Passions as absolutely as I have heard some First Ministers have done those of their Prince equally to his own personal Disreputation and to the Disadvantage of his People But  All this and much more according to Mr  Locke  is the Duty of a Tutor and on the finding out such an one depends his Scheme of an Home Education No Wonder then that he himself says  "When I consider the Scruples and Cautions I here lay in your Way methinks it looks as if I advised you to something which I would have offer'd at but in Effect not done  c  Permit me dear Sir in this Place to express my Fear that it is hardly possible for any one of Talents inferior to those of Mr  Locke  himself to come up to the  Rules he has laid down on this Subject and 'tis to be question'd whether even  he  with all that vast Stock of natural Reason and solid Sense for which as you tell me Sir he was so famous had attain'd to these Perfections at his first setting out into Life  Now therefore dear Sir you can't imagine how these Difficulties perplex me as to my knowing how to judge which is best an Home or a School Education For hear what this excellent Author so justly observes on the latter among other things no less to the Purpose  "I am sure he who is able to be at the Charge of a Tutor at Home may there give his Son a more genteel Carriage more manly Thoughts and a Sense of what is worthy and becoming with a greater Proficiency in Learning into the Bargain and ripen him up sooner into a Man than any at School can do Not that I blame the Schoolmaster in this"  says he  "or think it to be laid to his Charge The Difference is great between two or three Pupils in the same House and three or fourscore Boys lodg'd up and down For let the Master's Industry and Skill be never so great it is impossible he should have or Scholars under his Eye any longer than they are in the School together"  But then Sir if there be such a Difficulty as Mr  Locke  says to meet with a proper Tutor what a perplexing thing is this And what shall one say as to the Preference he gives to an Home Education in which such a Tutor is to be suppos'd necessary  But then according to this Gentleman there is another Difficulty attending an Home Education and is what I hinted at before in my second Article The Necessity there is to keep the Youth out of the Company of the meaner Servants who may set him bad Examples For thus he says  "Here is another great Inconvenience which Children  receive from the ill Examples which they meet with from the meaner Servants They are  wholly  if possible to be kept from such Conversation For the Contagion of these ill Precedents both in Civility and Virtue horribly infects Children as often as they come within Reach of it They frequently learn from unbred or debauched Servants such Language untowardly Tricks and Vices as otherwise they would be ignorant of all their Lives 'Tis an hard Matter wholly to prevent this Mischief"  continues he  "you will have very good Luck if you never have a clownish or vicious Servant and if from them your Children never get any Infection"  Then Sir my next Point which I mention'd in the Beginning of this Letter is a still greater Difficulty as it may happen in an Home Education to wit The Example of the Parents themselves if they be not very circumspect and discreet  All these Difficulties in an Home Education being put together let me dear Sir humbly propose it as a Matter for your Consideration and Determination Whether there be not a middle way to be found out in a School Education that may remedy some of these Inconveniencies For suppose Sir you cannot as the Task is so difficult get a Tutor so qualified as Mr  Locke  thinks he ought to be for your  Billy  as he grows up Suppose there is Danger from your meaner Servants and suppose we his Parents should not be able to lay ourselves under the requisite Restraints in order to form his Mind by our own Examples which I hope by GOD's Grace however will not be the Case Cannot some Master be found out who shall be so well rewarded for his Care of a  few  young Gentlemen as shall make it worth his while to be contented with those  few  suppose Five Six Seven  or Eight at most whose Morals and Breeding he may attend to as well as to their Learning The farther this Master lives from the young Gentlemens Friends the better it may be We will hope that he is a Man of a mild Disposition but strict in his Discipline and who shall make it a Rule not to give Correction for small Faults or till every other Method has been try'd who carries such a just Dignity in his Manner without the Appearance of Tyranny that his Looks may be of greater Force than the Words of some and his Words than the Blows of others and who will rather endeavour to shame than terrify a Youth out of his Faults Then Sir suppose such an one was to allot such a Portion of Time for the  more learned  Studies and before the Youth was tir'd with  them  suppose such another Portion was allotted for the  Writing  and  Arithmetick  Parts and then to relieve his Mind from both suppose the  Dancingmaster  should take his Part and innocent Exercises of mere Diversion to fill up the rest at his own Choice in which diverted by such a Rotation of Imployments all thus render'd delightful by their successive Variety he would hardly wish to pass much Time For the Dancing of itself will answer both Parts that of good Breeding and that of Exercise And thus different Studies at one time may be master'd  Moreover the Emulation which will be inspir'd where there are several young Gentlemen will be of inconceivable Use both to Tutor and Pupil in lessening the Trouble of the one and advancing the Learning of the other which cannot be expected where there is but a single young Gentleman to take care of  Such a Master will know it to be his Interest as well as his Duty to have a watchful Eye over the Conduct and Behaviour of his Servants His Assistants  in the different Branches of Science and Education will be Persons of approved Prudence for whom he will think himself answerable since his own  Reputation  will depend upon their Behaviour as well as his  Livelihood  The young Gentlemen will have young Gentlemen for their Companions all under the Influence of the same Precepts and Directions and if some chosen Period were fixed once a Week as a Reward for some Excellence where at a little Desk rais'd a Step or two above the other Seats the excelling Youth should be set to read under the Master's Direction a little Portion from the best Translations of the  Greek  and  Roman  Historians and even from the best  English  Authors this might in a very engaging manner initiate them into the Knowlege of the History of past Times and of their own Country and give them a Curiosity to pass some of their vacant Hours in the same laudable Pursuit For dear Sir I must still insist that Rewards and innocent Gratifications as also little Honours and Distinctions must needs be very attractive to the Minds of Youth  And don't you think dear Sir that the little Ride and Dairyhouse Breakfasting  See  Vol II  p    Also this  Vol  p    by which Miss  Goodwin  's Governess distinguishes the little Ladies who excel in their allotted Tasks is a sweet pretty Encouragement to their ductile Minds Yes it is to be sure And I have often thought of it with Pleasure and have partaken in a manner of the Delight that I have supposed their pretty Hearts must be fill'd with on the Occasion And why may not such little Triumphs be in Proportion as incentive to Children to master laudable Tasks as the  Roman  Triumphs of different Kinds and their  Mural and Civick Crowns all which I have heard you speak of were to their Heroes and Warriors of old For Mr  Dryden  well observes That  Men are but Children of a larger Growth  Our Appetites are apt to change as theirs  And full as craving too and full as vain  Permit me Sir to transcribe four or five Lines more for the Beauty of the Thought  And yet the Soul shut up in her dark Room  Viewing so clear  abroad  at  home  sees nothing  But like a Mole in Earth busy and blind  Works all her Folly up and casts it outward  To the World's open View  Improving the Thought methinks I can see the dear little Miss who has in some eminent Task borne away the Palm making her publick Entry as I may call it after her Dairy Breakfast and pretty Airing into her Governess's Courtyard through a Row of her Schoolfellows drawn out on each Side to admire her her Governess and Assistants receiving her at the Porch their little Capitol and lifting her out with Applauses and Encomiums with a  Thus shall it be done to the Miss whom her Governess delighteth to honour  I see not my Mr  B  why the dear Miss in this Case as she moves thro' her admiring Schoolfellows may not have her little Heart beat with as much Delight be as gloriously elated proportionally as that of the greatest Hero in his Triumphal Car who has return'd from Exploits perhaps much less laudable  But how I ramble Yet surely Sir you don't expect Method or Connexion from your Girl The Education of our Sex will not permit that where it is best We are forced to struggle for Knowlege  like the poor feeble Infant in the Month who as I describ'd in my first Letter on this Subject is pinn'd and fetter'd down upon the Nurse's Lap and who if its little Arms happen by Chance to escape its Nurse's Observation and offer but to expand themselves are immediately taken into Custody and pinion'd down to their passive Behaviour So when a poor Girl in spite of her narrow Education breaks out into Notice her Genius is immediately tamed by trifling Imployments lest perhaps she should become the Envy of one Sex and the Equal of the other But you Sir act more nobly by your  Pamela  for you throw in her Way all the Opportunities of Improvement that can offer and she has only to regret that she cannot make a better Use of them and of consequence render herself more worthy of your generous Indulgence  I know not how Sir to recover my Thread and so must break off with that Delight which I always take when I come near the Bottom of my Letters to your dear Self because then I can boast of the Honour which I have in being  Your ever dutiful  P B  LETTER LIV  WELL but my dear Mr  B  you will perhaps think from my last rambling Letter that I am most inclin'd to a  School  Education for your  Billy  some Years hence if it shall please GOD to spare him to us But indeed I cannot say that I am I only lay several things together in my usual indigested and roving way to take your Opinion upon which as it ought will be always decisive  with me And indeed I am so throughly convinc'd by Mr  Locke  's Reasons where the Behaviour of Servants can be so well answer'd for as that of yours can be where the Example of the Parents will be as I hope rather edifying than otherwise that without being sway'd as I think by maternal Fondness in this Case I must needs give a Preference to the Home Education and the little Scheme I presum'd to form in my last was only as you will be pleas'd to remember on a Supposition that those necessary Points could not be so well secur'd  In my Observations on this Head I shall take the Liberty Sir in one or two Particulars a little to differ from an Author that I admire exceedingly and that is the present Design of my writing these Letters for I shall hereafter if God spare my Life in my little Book when you have kindly decided upon the Points in which I presume to differ from that Gentleman shew you Sir my great Reverence and Esteem for him and shall then be able to let you know all my Sentiments on this important Subject and that more undoubtingly as I shall be more improv'd by Years and your dear Conversation especially Sir if I have the Honour and Happiness of a foreign Tour with you of which you give me Hope so much are you pleas'd with the Delight I take in these improving Excursions which you have now favour'd me with at times thro' more than half the Kingdom  Well then Sir I will proceed to consider a little more particularly the Subject of an Home Education with an Eye to those Difficulties which Mr  Locke  takes notice of as I have mention'd in my last  As to the first the Difficulty of finding a qualify'd Tutor we must not expect so much Perfection I doubt as Mr  Locke  lays down as necessary What therefore I humbly conceive is best to be done  will be to avoid chusing a Man of bigotted and narrow Principles who yet shall not be tainted with sceptical or heterodox Notions who shall not be a mere Scholar or Pedant who has travell'd and yet preserv'd his moral Character untainted and whose Behaviour and Carriage is easy unaffected unformal and genteel as well acquiredly as naturally so if possible who shall not be dogmatical positive overbearing on one hand nor too yielding suppliant fawning on the other who shall study the Child's natural Bent in order to direct his Studies to the Point in which he is most likely to excel In order to preserve the Respect due to his own Character from every one he must not be a Busybody in the Family a Whisperer a Talebearer but be a Person of a benevolent Turn of Mind ready to compose Differences who shall avoid of all things that Foppishness of Dress and Appearance which distinguishes the Petitsmaîtres and  French  Ushers that I have seen at some Boardingschools for Coxcombs rather than Guides of Education For as I have heard you my best Tutor often observe the Peculiarities of Habit where a Person aims at something fantastick or out of Character are an undoubted Sign of a wrong Head For such an one is so kind as always to hang out on his Sign what sort of Furniture he has in his Shop to save you the Trouble of asking Questions about him so that one may know what he  is  as much as one can know a Widow by her Weeds  Such a Person as I have thus negatively describ'd may be found without very much Difficulty perhaps because some of these Requisites are personal and others are such as are obvious at first Sight to a common Penetration or where not so may be found out by Inquiry into his general Character  and Behaviour And to the Care of such an one dear Sir let me for the present suppose your  Billy  is committed And so we acquit ourselves of the first Difficulty as well as we can that of the Tutor who to make himself more perfect may form himself as to what he wants by Mr  Locke  's excellent Rules on that Head  But before I quit this Subject will you give me Leave Sir to remind you of your own Opinion upon it in a Conversation that pass'd between you and Sir  George Stuart  and his Nephew in  London  in which you seem'd to prefer a  Scotish  Gentleman for a Tutor to those of your own Nation and still more than to those of  France  Don't you remember it dear Sir And how much those Gentlemen were pleas'd with your facetious Freedom with their Country and said You made them Amends for that in the Preference you gave to their learned and travell'd Youth If you have forgot it I will here transcribe it from my  Records  as I call my Book of Memorandums for every time I am pleas'd with a Conversation and have Leisure before it goes out of my Memory I enter it down as near the very Words as I can and now you have made me your Correspondent I shall sometimes perhaps give you back some Valuables from your own Treasure  Miss  Darnford  and Mr  Turner  and Mr  Fanshaw  were present I well remember These are your Words as I have them written down  "Since the Union of the Two Kingdoms we have many Persons of Condition who have taken Tutors for their Sons from  Scotland  which Practice to speak impartially has been attended with some advantageous Circumstances that should not be overlook'd For Sir  George  it  must be confess'd that notwithstanding your narrow and stiff manner of Education in  Scotland  a Spirit of manly Learning a kind of poetick Liberty as I may call it has begun to exert itself in that Part of the Island The blustering North forgive me Gentlemen seems to have harden'd the Foreheads of her hungry Sons and the Keenness with which they set out for Preferment in the kindlier South has taught them to know a good deal of the World betimes Thro' the easy Terms on which Learning is generally attain'd there as it is earlier inculcated so it may probably take deeper Root And since 'tis hardly possible forgive me dear Sir  George  and Mr  Stuart  they can go to a worse Country on this Side  Greenland  than some of the Northern Parts of  Scotland  so their Education with a View to travel and to better themselves by Settlements in other Countries may perhaps be so many Reasons for them to take greater Pains to qualify themselves for this Imployment and may make them succeed better in it especially when they have been able to shake off the Fetters which are rivetted upon them under the narrow Influences of a too tyrannical Kirkdiscipline which you Sir  George  have just now so freely censur'd  "To these Considerations when we add the Necessity which these remote Tutors lie under of behaving well because in the first place they seldom wish to return to their own Country and in the next because  that  cannot prefer them if it would and thirdly because it would not if it could if the Gentleman be of an inlarged Genius and generous way of Thinking I say when we add to the Premises these  Considerations they all make a kind of Security for their good Behaviour While those of our own Country have often Friends or Acquaintance on whose Favour they are apt to depend and for that Reason give less Attention to the Duties requisite for this important Office  "Besides as their kind Friend  Aeolus  who is accustom'd to spread and strengthen the bold Muscles of the strongfeatur'd  Scot  has generally blown away that inauspicious Bashfulness which hangs a much longer time commonly on the Faces of the Southern Students such an one if he falls not too egregiously into the contrary Extreme so as to become insufferable may still be the more eligible Person for a Tutor as he may teach a young Gentleman betimes that necessary Presence of Mind which those who are confin'd to a private Education sometimes want  "But after all if a Gentleman of this Nation be chosen for this Imployment it may be necessary that he should be such an one as has had as genteel and free an Education himself as his Country and Opportunities will afford and has had moreover the native Roughness of his Climate filed off and polished by Travel and Conversation who has made at least the Tour of  France  and  Italy  and has a Taste for the Politeness of the former Nation for from the natural Boisterousness of a  North Briton  and the fantastick Politeness of a  Frenchman  if happily blended such a Mixture may result as may furnish out a more complete Tutor than either of the Two Nations singly may be able to produce But it ought to be remember'd that this Person should by all means have conquer'd his native Brogue as I may call it and be a Master  of the  English  Pronunciation otherwise his Conversation will be very disagreeable to an  English  Ear  "And permit me Gentlemen to add That as an Acquaintance with the Muses contributes not a little to soften the Manners and to give a graceful and delicate Turn to the Imagination and a kind of Polish to severer Studies I believe it would not be amiss that he should have a Taste of Poetry altho' perhaps it were not to be wish'd he had such strong Inclinations that way as to make that lively and delectable Amusement his predominant Passion For we see very few Poets whose warm Imaginations do not run away with their Judgments And yet in order to learn the dead Languages in their Purity it will be necessary as I apprehend to inculcate both the Love and the Study of the antient Poets which cannot fail of giving a Youth a Taste for Poetry in general"  Permit me dear Sir to ask you Whether you advanc'd this for Argumentsake as sometimes you love to amuse and entertain your Friends in an uncommon way For I should imagine that our Two Universities which you have been so good as to shew me and for which I have ever since had a greater Reverence even than I had before are capable of furnishing as good Tutors as any Nation in the World For here the young Gentlemen seem to me to live both in the  World  and in the  University  and we saw several Gentlemen who had not only fine Parts and polite Behaviour but deep Learning as you assur'd me some of whom you entertain'd and were entertain'd by in so elegant a manner that no travell'd Gentleman if I may be allow'd to judge could excel them And  besides my dear Mr  B  I know who is reckon'd one of the politest and bestbred Gentlemen in  England  by every body and learned as well as polite and yet had his Education in one of those celebrated Seats of Learning I wish your  Billy  never may fall short of the Gentleman I mean in all these Acquirements and he will be a dear happy Creature I am sure  But how I wander again from my Subject I have no other way to recover myself when I thus ramble but by bringing back myself to that one delightful Point of Reflection that I have the Honour to be dear Sir  Your ever dutiful and obliged  P B  LETTER LV  Dearest Sir  I Now resume my Subject I had gone thro' the Article of the Tutor as well as I could and now let me trouble you with a few Lines upon what Mr  Locke  says That Children are wholly if possible to be kept from the Conversation of the meaner Servants whom he supposes to be as too frequently they are  unbred and debauch'd  to use his own Words  Now Sir let me observe on this Head that I think it is very difficult to keep Children from the Conversation of Servants at all times The Care of personal Attendance especially in the Child's early Age must fall upon Servants of one Denomination or other who little or much must be conversant with the inferior Servants and so be liable  to be tainted by their Conversation and it will be difficult in this Case to prevent the Taint being communicated to the Child Wherefore it will be a  surer  as well as a more  laudable  Method to insist upon the regular Behaviour of the whole Family than to expect the Child and its immediate Attendant or Tutor should be the only good ones in it  Nor is this so difficult a thing to bring about as may be imagin'd Your Family dear Sir affords an eminent Instance of it The Good have been confirm'd the Remiss have been reform'd the Passionate have been tam'd and there is not a Family in the Kingdom I will venture to say to the Honour of every Individual of it more uniform more regular and freer from Evil and more regardful of what they say and do than yours And I believe Sir you will allow that tho' they were always honest yet they were not always so laudably so exemplarily virtuous as of late Which I mention only to shew the Practicableness of a Reformation even where bad Habits have taken placeFor your  Pamela  Sir arrogates not to herself the Honour of this Change 'Tis owing to the Divine Grace shining upon Hearts naturally good for else an Example so easy so plain so simple from so young a Mistress who moreover had been exalted from their own Station could not have been attended with such happy Effects  You see dear Sir what a Master and Mistress's Example could do with a poor Soul so far gone as Mrs  Jewkes  And I dare be confident that if on the Hiring of a new Servant Sobriety of Manners and a virtuous Conversation were insisted upon and they were told that a general Inoffensiveness in Words as well as Actions was expected from them as indispensable Conditions of their Service  and that a Breach of that kind would be no more pass'd over than a wilful Fraud or Act of Dishonesty and if added to these Requisites their Principals take care to support these Injunctions by their own Example I say in this Case I dare be confident that if such a Service did not  find  them good it would  make  them so  And why indeed should we not think this a very practicable Scheme when it is consider'd that the Servants we take are at Years of Discretion and have the strong Tie of  Interest  superadded to the Obligations we require of them and which they must needs know let 'em have what bad Habits they will are right for  themselves  to discharge as well as for  us  to exact  We all know of how much Force the Example of Superiors is to Inferiors It is generally and too justly said That the Courts of Princes abound with the most profligate of Men insomuch that you cannot well give a Man a more significantly bad Title than by calling him a COURTIER Yet even among these one shall see the Force of  Example  as I have heard you Sir frequently observe For let but the Land be blest with a pious and religious Prince who makes it a Rule with him to countenance and promote none but Men of Virtue and Probity and to put the Case still stronger let such an one even succeed to the most libertine Reign wherein the Manners of the People have seem'd to be wholly deprav'd yet a wonderful Change will be immediately effected The flagitious Livers will be chas'd away or reform'd or at least will think it their Duty or their  Interest  which is a stronger Tie with such to  appear  reform'd and not a Man will seek for the Favour or Countenance of his Prince but by laudable Pretences or by worthy Actions  There was a Time the Reign of King  Richard  III when as I have read Deformity of Body was the Fashion and the Nobility and Gentry of the Court thought it an indispensable Requisite of a graceful Form to pad for themselves a round Shoulder because the King was crooked And can we think human Nature so absurdly wicked that it would not much rather have try'd to imitate a personal Perfection than a Deformity so shocking in its Appearance in People who were naturally strait  'Tis a melancholy thing to reflect that of all Professions of Men the Mariners who most behold the Wonders of Almighty Power display'd in the great Deep a Sight that has struck me with Awe and Reverence only from a Coast Prospect and who every Moment of their Lives while at Sea have but one frail Plank betwixt themselves and inevitable Destruction are yet generally speaking as I have often heard it observ'd the most abandon'd Invokers and Blasphemers of the Name of that GOD whose Mercies they every Moment unthankfully altho' so visibly experience Yet as I heard it once remark'd at your Table Sir on a particular Occasion we have now living one Commander in the  British  Navy who to his Honour has shewn the Force of an excellent Example supporting the best Precepts For on board of his Ship not an Oath or Curse was to be heard while Volleys of both issued from impious Mouths in the same Squadron out of his Knowlege seem'd to fill the Sails of other Ships with guilty Breath calling aloud for that Perdition to overtake them which perhaps his worthy Injunctions might be of Weight to suspend  If such then dear Sir be the Force of a good Example what have Parents to do who are dispos'd to bring up a Child at home under their own  Eye according to Mr  Locke  's Advice but first to have a strict Regard to  their own  Conduct This will not want its due Influence on the Servants especially if a proper Care and Scrutiny be made into their Characters before they are entertain'd and a watchful Eye be had over them to keep them up to those Characters afterwards And when they know they must forfeit the Favour of a worthy Master and their Places too which may be thought to be the best of Places because an  uniform  Character must make all around it easy and happy they will readily observe such Rules and Directions as shall be prescrib'd to themRules and Directions which their own Consciences will tell them are  right  to be prescrib'd and even  right  for them to follow were they  not  insisted upon by their Superiors And this Conviction must go a great way towards their  thorough  Reformation For a Person wholly convinc'd is half reform'd And thus the Hazard a Child will run of being corrupted by conversing with the Servants will be remov'd and all Mr  Locke  's other Rules be better inforc'd  I have the Boldness Sir to make another Objection and that is to the Distance which Mr  Locke  prescribes to be kept between Children and Servants For may not this be a Means to fill the Minds of the former with a Contempt of those below them and an Arrogance that is not warranted by any Rank or Condition to their Inferiors of the same Species  I have transcrib'd Sir  See p    what Mr  Locke  has injoin'd in relation to this Distance where he says That the Children are by all means to be kept  wholly  from the Conversation of the meaner ServantsBut how much better Advice does the same  Author give for the Behaviour of Children to Servants in the following Words Which I humbly presume to think are not so intirely consistent with the former as might be expected from so admirable an Author  "Another way" says he § "to instil Sentiments of Humanity and to keep them lively in young Folks will be to accustom them to Civility in their Language and Deportment towards their Inferiors and the meaner sort of People particularly Servants It is not unusual to observe the Children in Gentlemens Families treat the Servants of the House with domineering Words Names of Contempt and an imperious Carriage as if they were of another Race and Species beneath them Whether ill Example the Advantage of Fortune or their natural Vanity inspire this Haughtiness it should be prevented or weeded out and a gentle courteous affable Carriage towards the lower Ranks of Men plac'd in the Room of it No Part of their Superiority"  continues this excellent Author  "will be hereby lost but the Distinction increas'd and their Authority strengthen'd when Love in Inferiors is join'd to outward Respect and an Esteem of the Person has a Share in their Submission And Domesticks will pay a more ready and chearful Service when they find themselves not spurn'd because Fortune has laid them below the Level of others at their Master's Feet"  These dear Sir are certainly the Sentiments of a generous and inlarg'd Spirit But I hope I shall be forgiven if I observe that the great Distance Mr  Locke  before injoins to be kept between Children and Servants is not very consistent with the  abovecited For if we would prevent this undue Contempt of Inferiors in the Temper of Children the best way as I humbly presume to think is not to make it so unpardonable a Fault for them especially in their early Years to be in their Company For can one make the Children shun the Servants without rendering them odious or contemptible to them and representing them to the Child in such disadvantageous Lights as must needs make the Servants vile in their Eyes and themselves lofty and exalted in their own and thereby cause them to treat them with  "domineeringWords and an imperious Carriage as if they were of another Race or Species beneath them and so"  as Mr  Locke  says  "nurse up their natural Pride into an habitual Contempt of those beneath them And then"  as he adds  "where will that probably end but in Oppression and Cruelty"  But this Matter dear Sir as I presume to think will all be happily accommodated and reconcil'd when the Servants good Behaviour is secur'd by the Example and Injunctions of the Principals  Upon the Whole then of what Mr  Locke  has injoin'd and what I have taken the Liberty to suggest on this Head it shall be my Endeavour in that early Part of your dear  Billy  's Education which your Goodness will intrust to me to inculcate betimes in his Mind the Principles of universal Benevolence and Kindness to others especially to Inferiors  Nor dear Sir shall I fear that the little Dear will be wanting to himself in assuming as he grows up an Air of Superiority and Distance of Behaviour equal to his Condition or that he will descend too low for his Station For Sir there is a Pride and Selflove natural to human Minds that will seldom  be kept so low as to make them humbler than they ought to be  I have observ'd before now Instances of this in some of the Families we visit between the young Masters or Misses and those Children of lower Degree who have been brought to play with them or divert them On the Masters and Misses Side I have always seen they lead the Play and prescribe the Laws of it be the Diversion what it will while on the other hand their lowerrank Playfellows have generally given into their little Humours tho' ever so contrary to their own and the Difference of Dress and Appearance and the Notion they have of the more eminent Condition of their Playfellows Parents have begot in them a kind of Awe and Respect that perhaps more than sufficiently secures the Superiority of the one and the Subordination of the other  The Advantage of this universal Benevolence to a young Gentleman as he grows up will be as I humbly conceive that it will so diffuse itself over his Mind as to influence all his Actions and give a Grace to every thing he does or says and make him admir'd and respected from the best and most durable Motives and will be of greater Advantage to him for his attaining an handsome Address and Behaviour for it will make him conscious that he  merits  the Distinction he will meet with and encourage him still  more  to merit it than the best Rules that can be given him for that Purpose  I will therefore teach the little Dear Courteousness and Affability from the properest Motives I am able to think of and will instruct him in only one Piece of Pride That of being above doing a mean or low Action I will caution him not to behave in a lordly or insolent manner even to the  lowest Servants I will tell him as I do my dear Miss  Goodwin  That that Superiority is the most commendable and will be best maintain'd that is owing to Humanity and Kindness and which is grounded on the Perfections of the  Mind  rather than on the  accidental  Advantages of  Fortune  and  Condition  That if his Conduct be such as it ought to be there will be no Occasion to tell a Servant that he  will  be observ'd and respected That  Humility  as I once told my Miss  Goodwin  See p    l    is a charming Grace and most conspicuously charming in Persons of Distinction for that the Poor who are humbled by their Condition cannot glory in it as the Rich may and that it makes the lower Ranks of People love and admire the Highborn who can so condescend Whereas  Pride  in such is Meanness and Insult as it owes its Boast and its Being to accidental Advantages which at the same time are seldom of  his  procuring who can be so mean as to be proud That even I would sooner forgive Pride in a low Degree than in an high for it may be a Security in the first against doing a base thing But in the Rich it is a base thing itself and an impolitick one too for the more Distinction a proud Mind grasps at the less it will have and every poor despis'd Person can whisper such an one in the Ear when surrounded with and adorn'd by all his glittering Splendors that he  was  born and  must  die in the  same manner  with those whom he despises  Thus will the Doctrine of Benevolence and Affability inculcated early in the Mind of Youth and duly cultivated as he grows up inspire the young Gentleman with the requisite Conduct to command  Respect from  proper  Motives and at the same time that it will make the Servants observe a Decorum towards him it will oblige them to have a Guard upon their Words and Actions in the Presence of one whose Manner of Education and Trainingup would be so great a Reproach to them if they were grosly faulty So that hereby as I conceive a mutual Benefit would flow to the Manners of each and  his  good Behaviour would render him in some measure an instructive Monitor to the whole Family  But permit me Sir to inlarge on the Hint I have already given in relation to the Example of the Parents in case a Preference be given to the Home Education For if this Point cannot be secur'd I should always imagine it were best to put the Child to such a School as I have taken the Liberty to mention  See p    But yet the Subject Sir might be spar'd by me in the present Case as I write with a View only to your Family tho' you will remember that while I follow Mr  Locke  whose Work is publick I must be consider'd as if I was directing myself to the Generality of the World For Sir I have the Pleasure to say That your Conduct in your Family is unexceptionable and the Pride to think that mine is no Disgrace to it No one hears a Word from your Mouth unbecoming the Character of a polite Gentleman and I shall always endeavour to be very regardful of what falls from mine Your Temper Sir is equal and kind to all your Servants and they love you as well as awefully respect you And well does your Generosity and bountiful and considerate Mind deserve it of them all▪ And they seeing I am  watchful over my own Conduct so as not to behave unworthy of your kind Example regard me as much as I could wish they should for well do they know that their beloved Master will have it so and greatly honours and esteems me himself Your Tabletalk is such as Persons of the strictest Principles may hear and join in Your Guests and your Friends are generally speaking Persons of the genteelest Life and of the best Manners So that Mr  Locke  would have advis'd  you  of all Gentlemen had he been living and known you to give your Children an Home Education and assign'd these and still stronger Reasons for it  But dear Sir were we to speak to the Generality it is to be fear'd this would be an almost insuperable Objection to it For I am sorry to say it but when one turns one's Eyes to the bad Precedents given by the Heads of some Families it is hardly to be wonder'd at that there is so little Virtue and Religion among Men For can those Parents be surpris'd at the Ungraciousness of their  Children  who hardly ever shew them that their  own  Actions are govern'd by reasonable or moral Motives Can the gluttonous Father expect a selfdenying Son With how ill a Grace must a Man who will often be disguis'd in Liquor preach Sobriety A passionate Man Patience An irreligious Man Piety How will a Parent whose Hands are seldom without Cards or Dice be observ'd in Lessons against the pernicious Vice of Gaming Can the profuse Father who is squandering away the Fortunes of his Children expect to be regarded in a Lesson of Frugality 'Tis impossible he should except it were that the Youth seeing how pernicious his Father's Example is should have the Grace to make a proper Use of it and look upon it as a  Seamark as it were to enable him to shun the dangerous Rocks on which he sees his Father splitting And even in this  best  Case let it be consider'd how much Shame and Disgrace this thoughtless Parent ought to take to himself who can admonish his Child by nothing but the  Odiousness  of his own Vice and how little it is owing to him that his Guilt is not  doubled  by his Son's treading in his Steps Let such an unhappy Parent duly weigh this and think how likely he may be by his bad Example to be the Cause of his Child's Perdition as well as his own and stand unshock'd and unamended if he can  Give me Leave to add That it is then of no Avail to wish for discreet Servants if the Conduct of the Parents is faulty If the Fountainhead be polluted how shall the Undercurrents run clear That Master or Mistress who would exact from their Servants a Behaviour which they themselves don't practise will be but ill observ'd And that Child who discovers great Excesses and Errors in his Parents will be found to be less profited by their good Precepts than prejudic'd by their bad Examples Excessive Fondness this Hour violent Passions and perhaps Execrations the next unguarded Jests an Admiration for fashionable Vanities rash Censures are perhaps the best that the Child sees in or hears from those who are most concern'd to inculcate good Precepts into his Mind And where it is so an Home Education is not by any means surely to be chosen  Having Sir as well as my slender Abilities will permit presum'd to deliver my Opinion upon Three great Points  viz  The Qualifications of a Tutor The Necessity of having an Eye to the Morals of Servants and The Example of Parents all which  being taken care of gives a Preference as I imagine to an Home Education permit me dear Sir to offer one more Point on this Subject to your Consideration altho' I just touch'd upon it before  It is that of  Emulation  which I humbly conceive to be of great Efficacy to lead Children on in their Duties and Studies And how dear Sir shall this Advantage be procur'd for a young Master who has no Schoolfellows and who has no Example to follow but that of his Tutor whom he cannot from the Disparity of Years and other Circumstances without Pain because of this Disparity think of emulating And this I conceive is a very great Advantage to such a School Education as I mentioned in my former Letter  See p    where there are no more Scholars than the Master can with Ease and Pleasure instruct  But one way in my humble Opinion is left to answer this Objection and still preserve the Reason for the Preference which Mr  Locke  gives to an Home Education and that is what I formerly hinted to you dear Sir  See p    to take into your Family the Child of some honest Neighbour of but middling Circumstances and like Age with your own but who should give apparent Indications of his natural Promptitude ingenuous Temper obliging Behaviour and good Manners and to let him go handinhand with yours in his several Studies and Lessons under the same Tutor  This Child would be sensible of the Benefit as well as the Distinction he receiv'd and consequently of what was expected from him and would double his Diligence and exert all his good Qualities which would inspire the young Gentleman with the  wish'dfor Emulation and as I imagine would be so promotive of his Learning that it would even greatly compensate the Tutor's Pains with the additional Scholar for the young Gentleman would be asham'd to be outdone by one of like Years and Stature with himself And little Rewards might be propos'd to the greatest Proficient in order to heighten the Emulation  Then Sir permit me to add That the  Generosity  of such a Method to a Gentleman of your Fortune and beneficent Mind would be its own Reward were there no other Benefit to be receiv'd by it  Moreover such an ingenious Youth might by his good Morals and Industry hereafter be of Service in some Place of Trust in the Family and it would be easy for a Gentleman of your Interest in the World if such a thing offer'd not to provide for the Youth in the Navy in some of the publick Offices or among your private FriendsIf he prov'd faulty in his Morals his Dismission would be in your own Power and would be Punishment enough  But if on the other hand he prov'd a sober and hopeful Youth such an one would make an excellent Companion for your  Billy  in riper Years as he would be in a manner a Corroborator of his Morals for as his Circumstances would not support him in any Extravagance so those Circumstances would be a Check upon his Inclinations and this being seconded by the Hopes of future Preferment from your Favour and Interest which he could not expect but upon the Terms of his Perseverance in Virtue he would find himself under a Necessity of setting such an Example as might be of great Benefit to his Companion Who should be watch'd as he grew up  that he did not if his ample Fortune became dangerous to his Virtue contribute of his Affluence to draw the other after him into Extravagance And to this End as I humbly conceive the noble Doctrine of  Independence  should be early instill'd into both their Minds and upon all Occasions inculcated and inforc'd which would be an Inducement for the one to endeavour to  improve  his Fortune by his honest Industry lest he should never be inabled to rise out of a State of Dependence and to the other to  keep  if not  improve  his own lest he should ever fall into such a servile State and thereby lose the glorious Power of conferring Obligations on the Deserving which surely is one of the highest Pleasures that a generous Mind can know  A Pleasure Sir which you have oftener experienc'd than Thousands of Gentlemen And which may you still continue to experience for a long long and happy Succession of Years to come is the Prayer of one the most oblig'd of all others in her own Person as well as in the Persons of her dearest Relations and who owes to this glorious Beneficence the Honour she boasts of being  Your ever dutiful and grateful  P B  LETTER LVI  BUT now my dear Mr  B  if you will indulge me in a Letter or two more preparative to my little Book that I mention'd I will take the Liberty to touch upon one or two other Places wherein I differ from this learned Gentleman But first permit me to observe that if Parents are above all  things to avoid giving bad Examples to their Children they will be no less careful to shun the Practice of such fond Fathers and Mothers as are wont to indulge their Children in bad Habits and give them their Head at a time when like Wax their tender Minds may be moulded into what Shape they please This is a Point that if it please GOD I will carefully attend to because it is the Foundation on which the Superstructure of the whole future Man is to be erected For according as he is indulg'd or check'd in his childish Follies a Ground is laid for his future Happiness or Misery and if once they are suffer'd to become habitual to him it cannot but be expected that they will grow up with him and that they will hardly ever be eradicated "Try it" says Mr  Locke  speaking to this very Point  "in a Dog or an Horse or any other Creature and see whether the ill and resty Tricks they have learn'd when young are easily to be mended when they are knit▪ And yet none of these Creatures are half so wilful and proud or half so desirous to be Masters of themselves as Men"  And this brings me dear Sir to the Head of  Punishments  in which as well as in the Article of  Rewards  which I have touch'd upon I have a little Objection to somewhat advanc'd by Mr  Locke    But permit me Sir however to premise that I am exceedingly pleas'd with the Method laid down by this excellent Writer rather to shame the Child out of his Fault than beat him which latter serves generally for nothing but to harden his Mind  Obstinacy  and telling a  Lye  and committing a  wilful  Fault and then  persisting  in it are I agree with this Gentleman the only Causes for which the Child should be punish'd with Stripes And I  admire the Reasons he gives against a too rigorous and severe Treatment of Children  But I will give Mr  Locke  's Words to which I have some Objection  "It may be doubted" says he  "concerning Whipping when as the  last  Remedy it comes to be necessary at  what time  and by  whom  it should be done whether presently upon the committing the Fault whilst it is yet fresh and hotI think it should not be done presently"  adds he  "lest Passion mingle with it and so tho' it exceed the just Proportion yet it lose of its due Weight For even Children discern whenever we do things in a Passion"  I must beg Leave dear Sir to differ from Mr  Locke  in this Point for I think it ought rather to be a Rule with Parents who shall chastize their Children to conquer what would be extreme in  their own  Passion on this Occasion for those Parents who cannot do it are very unfit to be Punishers of the wayward Passions of their Children than to  defer  the Punishment especially if the Child knows its Fault has reach'd its Parent's Ear It is otherwise methinks giving the Child if of an obstinate Disposition so much more Time to harden its Mind and bid Defiance to its Punishment  Just now dear Sir your  Billy  is brought into my Presence all smiling crowing to come to me and full of heartchearing Promises and the Subject I am upon goes to my Heart Surely surely I can never beat your  Billy  Dear little Life of my Life how can I think thou canst ever deserve it or I can ever inflict itNo my Baby that shall be thy Papa's Task if ever thou art so heinously naughty and whatever  he  does must be rightPardon my foolish Fondness dear SirI will proceed  If then I humbly presume to advise the Fault be so atrocious as to deserve Whipping and the Parent be resolv'd on this exemplary Punishment by no means I should imagine ought the Childpoor dear little Soulto come into one's Presence without meeting his due Reward For else I should think a Fondness too natural to be resisted will get the Upperhand of one's Resentment and how shall one be able to whip the dear Creature one cannot be angry with Then after he has once seen one without meeting his Punishment will he not be inclin'd to hope for Connivance at his Fault And may he not be apt for Childrens Resentments are strong to impute to Cruelty a Correction that should always appear to be inflicted with Reluctance and thro' Motives of Love  If from Anger at his Fault one should go  above the due Proportion  I am sure I might be trusted for this let it take its CourseHow barbarously methinks I speakHe ought to  feel  the Lash first Because he  deserves  it poor little Creature Next Because it is  propos'd  to be exemplary And lastly Because it is not intended to be  often  us'd And the very Passion or Displeasure one expresses if it be not enormous will shew one is in Earnest and inspire him with a necessary Awe and make him be afraid to offend again The  End  of the Correction is to shew him the Difference betwixt a kind Parent and a provok'd one And as it is proper to take him at his first Offer of a full Submission and Repentance and not before and instantly dispassionate one's self and shew him the Difference by Acts of Pardon and Kindness which will let him see that one punishes him out of Necessity rather than Choice so one would not be afraid to make him smart so sufficiently that he should not  soon forget the Severity of the Discipline nor the Disgrace of it There's a cruel Mamma for you Mr  B  What my  Practice  may be I can't tell but this  Theory  I presume to think is right  As to the Act itself I much approve Mr  Locke  's Advice to do it by Pauses mingling Stripes and Expostulations together to shame and terrify the more and the rather as the Parent by this slow manner of inflicting the Punishment will less need to be afraid of giving too violent a Correction for those Pauses will afford  him  as well as the  Child  Opportunities for Consideration and Reflection  But as to the Person by whom the Discipline should be perform'd I humbly conceive that this excellent Author is here also to be objected to  "If you have a discreet Servant" says he "capable of it and has the Place of governing your Child for if you have a Tutor there is no Doubt I think it is best the Smart should come immediately from another's Hand tho' by the Parent's Order who should see it done whereby the Parent's Authority will be preserv'd and the Child's Aversion for the Pain it suffers rather be turn'd on the Person that immediately inflicts it For I would have a Father seldom strike the Child but upon very urgent Necessity and as the last Remedy"  'Tis in such an urgent Case dear Sir that we are supposing it should be done at all If there be not a Reason strong enough for the Father's whipping the Child himself there cannot be any sufficient for his ordering any other to do it and standing by to see it done But I humbly presume to think that if there be a Necessity for it no one can be so fit as the Father himself to do it The Child cannot dispute  his  Authority to punish from whom  he receives and expects all the good Things of this Life He cannot question  his  Love to him and after the Smart is over and his Obedience secur'd must believe that so tender so indulgent a Father could have no other End in whipping him but his Good Against him he knows he has no Remedy but must passively submit and when he is convinc'd he  must  he will in time conclude that he  ought    But to have this severe Office perform'd by a Servant tho' at the Father's Command and that professedly that the Aversion of the Child for the Pain it suffers should be turn'd on the Person who immediately inflicts it is I am humbly of Opinion the  Reverse  of what ought to be done And  more  so if this Servant has any Direction of the Child's Education and still  much  more so if it be his Tutor notwithstanding Mr  Locke  says there is no Doubt if there be a Tutor that it should be done by him  For dear Sir is there no Doubt that the Tutor should lay himself open to the Aversion of the Child whose Morals he is to direct whose Manners he is to form Is it not the best Method a Tutor can take in order to inforce the Lessons he would inculcate to endeavour to attract the Love and Attention of his Pupil by the most winning mild and inviting Ways that he can possibly think of And yet is  he  this very Tutor  out of all Doubt  to be the Instrument of doing an harsh and disgraceful thing and that in the last Resort when all other Methods are found ineffectual and that too because he ought to incur the Child's Resentment and Aversion rather than the Father No surely Sir it is not reasonable it should be so Quite contrary in my  humble Notion there can be no Doubt that it should be  otherwise    It should methinks be enough for a Tutor in case of a Fault in the Child to threaten to complain to his Father but yet not to make such Complaint without the Child obstinately persists in his Error which too should be of a Nature to merit such an Appeal And this methinks would highly contribute to preserve the Parent's Authority who on this Occasion should never fail of extorting a Promise of Amendment or of instantly punishing him with his own Hands And to heighten the Esteem of the Child to his Tutor and to reconcile him to him for complaining of him it might not possibly be amiss that his Interposition in the Child's Favour if the Fault were not too flagrant should be permitted to save him once or twice from the impending Discipline  'Tis certain that the Passions if I may so call them of Affection and Aversion are very early discoverable in Children insomuch that they will even before they can speak afford us Marks for the Detection of an hypocritical Appearance of Love to it before the Parents Faces For the Fondness or Averseness of the Child to some Servants as I have observ'd in other Families will at any time let one know whether their Love to the Baby is uniform and the same when one is absent as present For in one Case the Child will reject with Sullenness all the little Sycophancies that are made to it in one's Sight while on the other its Fondness of one who generally obliges it is an infallible Rule to judge of such an one's Sincerity behind one's Back This little Instance shews the Strength of a Child's Resentments and its Sagacity at the earliest Age in discovering who obliges and who disobliges  it And hence one may infer how improper a Person  he  is whom we would have a Child to love and respect or by whose Precepts we would have it directed to be the Punisher of his Faults or to do any harsh or disagreeable Office to it  For my own Part dear Sir I must take the Liberty to declare that if the Parent were not to inflict the Punishment himself I think it much better it should be given him in the Parent's Presence by the Servant of the lowest Consideration in the Family and one whose Manners and Example one would be the least willing of any other he should follow Just as the common Executioner who is the lowest and most flagitious Officer of the Commonwealth and who frequently deserves as much as the Criminal the Punishment he is chosen to inflict is pitch'd upon to perform as a Mark of greater Ignominy those Sentences which are intended as Examples to deter others from the Commission of heinous Crimes And this was the Method the Almighty took when he was dispos'd to correct severely his chosen People For in that Case He generally did it by the Hands of the most profligate Nations around them as we read in many Places of the Old Testament  But the following Rule among a thousand others equally excellent I admire in Mr  Locke  "When" says he "for any Misdemeanour the Father or Mother looks sour on the Child every one else should put on the same Coldness to him and nobody give him Countenance till Forgiveness ask'd and a Reformation of his Fault has set him right again and restor'd him to his former Credit If this were constantly observ'd"  adds he  "I guess there would be little Need of Blows or Chiding Their own Ease or Satisfaction would  quickly teach Children to court Commendation and avoid doing that which they found every body condemn'd and they were sure to suffer for without being chid or beaten This would teach them Modesty and Shame and they would quickly come to have a natural Abhorrence for that which they found made them slighted and neglected by every body"  This affords me dear Sir a pretty Hint For if ever your charming  Billy  should be naughty what would I do but proclaim throughout your worthy Family that the little Dear was in Disgrace And one should shun him another should decline answering him a third should say No Master I cannot obey you till your Mamma is pleas'd with you A fourth Who should mind what little Masters bid them do when little Masters won't mind what their Mamma's say to them And when the dear little Soul found this he would come in my Way and I see pardon me my dear Mr  B  he has some of his Papa's Spirit already indeed he has and I will direct myself with double Kindness to your beloved  Davers  and to my Miss  Goodwin  and take no Notice at all of the dear Creature if I can help it till I see his Papa forgive my Boldness Sir banish'd from his little sullen Brow and all his Mamma rise to his Eyes And when his musical Tongue shall be unlock'd to own his Fault and promise AmendmentO then how shall I clasp him to my Bosom and Tears of Joy I know will meet his Tears of PenitenceHow these Flights dear Sir please a bodyWhat Delights have those Mamma's which some fashionable Ladies are quite unacquainted with who can make their dear Babies and their first Educations their Entertainment and Diversion To watch the beamy  Dawnings of Reason in them to direct their little Passions as they shew themselves to this or that particular Point of Benefit and Use and to prepare the sweet Virgin Soil of their Minds to receive the Seeds of Virtue and Goodness so early that as they grow up one need only now a little Pruning and now a little Watering to make them the Ornaments and Delights of the Garden of this Life And then their pretty Ways their fond and grateful Endearments some new Beauty every Day rising to ObservationO my dearest Mr  B  whose Enjoyments and Pleasures are so great as those of such Mamma's as can bend their Minds two or three Hours every Day to the Duties of the Nursery  I have a few other things to observe upon Mr  Locke  's Treatise which when I have done I shall read admire and improve by the rest as my Years and Experiences advance of which in my propos'd little Book I shall give you better Proofs than I am able to do at present raw crude and indigested as the Notions of so young a Mamma must needs be But these shall be the Subjects of another Letter for now I am come to the Pride and the Pleasure I always have when I subscribe myself dearest Sir  Your ever dutiful and grateful  P B  LETTER LVII  Dear Sir  MR  Locke  gives a great many very pretty Instructions relating to the Playgames of Children  but I humbly presume to think what he says in one or two Places a little objectionable  He would not indulge them in any Playthings but what they make themselves or endeavour to make  "A smooth Pebble a Piece of Paper the Mother's Bunch of Keys or any thing they cannot hurt themselves with"  he rightly says  "serves as much to divert little Children as those more chargeable and curious Toys from the Shops which are presently put out of Order and broken"  These Playthings may certainly do well enough as he observes for little ones But methinks to a Person of easy Circumstances as the making these Toys imploys the industrious Poor the buying them for the Child might be dispens'd with tho' they  were  easily broken and especially as they are of all Prices and some less costly and more durable than others  "Tops Gigs Battledors" Mr  Locke  observes "which are to be used with Labour should indeed be procur'd themnot for Variety but Exercise But if they had a Top the Scourgestick and Leatherstrap should be left to their own making and fitting"  But may I presume to say That whatever be the Good Mr  Locke  proposes by this it cannot be equal to the Mischief Children may do themselves in making these Playthings For must they not have Implements to work with And is not a Knife or other edg'd Tool without which it is impossible they can make or shape a Scourgestick or  any  of their Playthings a fine Instrument in a Child's Hands This Advice is the Reverse of the Caution warranted from all Antiquity  That 'tis dangerous to meddle with edg'd Tools  And I am  afraid the Tutor must often act the Surgeon and follow the Indulgence with a Styptick and a Plaister and the young Gentleman's Hands might be so often bound up that it might indeed perhaps be one way to cure him of his earnest Desire to play but I can hardly imagine any other Good that it can do him For I doubt the excellent Consequences propos'd by our Author from this Doctrine such as to teach the Child Moderation in his Desires Application Industry Thought Contrivance and good Husbandry Qualities that as he observes will be useful to him when he is a Man are too remote to be ingrafted upon such Beginnings Altho' it must be confess'd that as Mr  Locke  wisely observes good Habits and Industry cannot be too early inculcated  But then Sir may I ask Are not the very Play and Sports to which Children accustom themselves whether they make their own Playthings or not equivalent to the Work or Labour of grown Persons Yes Sir I will venture to say they are and more than equivalent to the Exercises and Labour of many  Mr  Locke  advises that the Child's Playthings should be as few as possible which I intirely agree with That they should be in his Tutor's Power who is to give him but one at once But as it is the Nature of the human Mind to court most what is prohibited and to set light by what is in its own Power so I am half doubtful only that Mr  Locke  says it and the Matter may not be so very important as other Points in which I have taken the Liberty to differ from that Gentleman Whether the Child's absolute Possession of his own Playthings in some little Repository of which he may be permitted to keep the Key especially if he make no bad Use of the Privilege would not make him  more indifferent to them while the contrary Conduct might possibly inhance his Value of them And if when he had done with any Plaything he were oblig'd to put it into its allotted Place and was accustom'd to keep Account of the Number and Places of them severally this would teach him Order and at the same time instruct him to make a proper Account of them and to avoid being a Squanderer or Waster And if he should omit to put them in their Places or be careless of his Playthings the Command of them taken away for a time or threatening to give them away to others would make him be more heedful  Mr  Locke  says  "That he has known a Child so distracted with the Number and Variety of his Playgames that he tired his Maid every Day to look them over And was so accustom'd to Abundance that he never thought he had enough but was always asking What more What new thing shall I have A good Introduction"  adds he  "to moderate Desires and the ready way to make a contented happy Man"  All that I shall offer to this is that there are few  Men  so philosophical as one would wish them to be much less  Children  But no Doubt that this Variety engag'd the Child's Activity which of the two might be turn'd to better Purposes than Sloth or Indolence and if the Maid was tired it might be because she was not so much alive as the Child and perhaps the Grievance might not be so great because if she was his Attendant 'tis probable she had nothing else to do  However in the main as Mr  Locke  says it is no matter how few Playthings the Child is indulg'd with But yet I can hardly persuade myself that Plenty of them can have such bad Consequences as  the Gentleman apprehends and the rather because they will excite his Attention and keep alive his Industry and Activity His Inquiry after new Things let him have few or many is to be expected as a Branch of those natural Desires which are implanted in him and will every Day increase But this may be observ'd That as he grows in Years he will be above some Playthings and so the Number of the old ones will be always reducible perhaps in a greater Proportion than the new ones will increase  Mr  Locke  observes on the Head of good Breeding That  "There are two Sorts of ill Breeding the one a sheepish Bashfulness and the other a misbecoming Negligence and Disrespect in our Carriage both which says he are avoided by duly observing this one Rule Not to think meanly of ourselves and not to think meanly of others"  I think as Mr  Locke  explains this Rule it is an excellent one But on this Head I would beg Leave to observe that however discommendable a bashful Temper is in some Instances where it must be deem'd a Weakness of the Mind yet in my humble Opinion it is generally the Mark of an ingenuous one and is always to be preferr'd to an undistinguishing and hardy Confidence which is as it seems to me the genuine Production of unfeeling Ignorance  What is faulty in it which Mr  Locke  calls  Sheepishness  should indeed be shaken off as soon as possible because it is an Enemy to Merit in its Advancement in the World But were I to chuse a Companion for your  Billy  as he grows up I should not think the worse of the Youth who not having had the Opportunities of knowing Men or seeing the World had this Defect On the contrary  I should be apt to look upon it as an outward Fence or Inclosure as I may say to his Virtue which might keep off the lighter Attacks of Immorality the  Hussars  of Vice as I may say who are not able to carry on a formal Siege against his Morals and I should expect such an one to be docile humane goodhumour'd diffident of himself and so most likely to improve as well in Mind as Behaviour While an harden'd Mind that never doubts itself must be a Stranger to its own Infirmities and suspecting none is impetuous overbearing incorrigible and if rich a Tyrant if not possibly an Invader of other Mens Properties  Mr  Locke  proposes § a very pretty Method to cheat Children as it were into Learning But then he adds  "There may be Dice and Playthings with the Letters on them to teach Children the Alphabet by playing"  And in another Place §  "I know a Person of great Qualitywho by pasting on the six Vowels for in our Language  y  is one on the six Sides of a Die and the remaining eighteen Consonants on the Sides of three other Dice has made this a Play for his Children that he shall win who at one Cast throws most Words on these four Dice whereby his eldest Son yet in Coats has  play'd  himself  into Spelling  with great Eagerness and without once having been chid for it or forced to it"  I must needs say my dear Mr  B  that I should rather your  Billy  should be a Twelvemonth backwarder for want of this Method than forwarded by it For what may not be apprehended from so early inculcating the Use of Dice and Gaming upon the Minds of Children Let Mr  Locke  himself speak for this in his § and I should be glad to be able  to reconcile the two Passages in this excellent Author  "As to Cards and Dice" says he "I think the safest and best way is never to learn any Play upon them and so to be incapacitated for these dangerous Temptations and incroaching Wasters of useful Time"  and he might have added of the noblest Estates and Fortunes while Sharpers and Scoundrels have been listed into Distinction upon their Ruins Yet in § Mr  Locke  proceeds to give particular Directions in relation to the Dice he recommends  But after all if some innocent Plays were fix'd upon to cheat Children into Reading that as he says should look as little like a Task as possible it must needs be of Use for that Purpose But let every Gentleman who has a Fortune to lose and who if he games is on a foot with the vilest Company who generally have nothing at all to risque tremble at the Thoughts of teaching his Son tho' for the most laudable Purposes the early Use of Dice and Gaming  But dear Sir permit me to say how much I am charm'd with an Hint in Mr  Locke  which makes your  Pamela  hope she may be of greater Use to your Children even as they  grow up  than she could ever have flatter'd herself to be'Tis a charming charming Paragraph I must not skip one Word of it Thus it begins and I will observe upon it as I go along  "§ But under whose Care soever a Child is put to be taught"  says Mr  Locke    "during the tender and flexible Years of his Life this is certain it should be one who thinks  Latin  and Language the least Part of Education"  How agreeable is this to my Notions which I durst not have avow'd but after so excellent a Scholar  For I have long had the Thought that a deal of precious Time is wasted to little Purpose in the Attaining of  Latin  Mr  H  I think says he was Ten Years in endeavouring to learn it and as far as I can find knows nothing at all of the Matter neitherIndeed he lays that to the wicked Picture in his Grammar which he took for granted as he has said several times as well as once  See  Vol III  p    written was put there to teach Boys to rob Orchards instead of improving their Minds in Learning or common Honesty  But for this is too light an Instance for the Subject Mr  Locke  proceeds  "One who knowing how much Virtue and a welltemper'd Soul is to be preferr'd to any sort of  Learning  or  Language  "  What a noble Writer is this  "makes it his chief Business to form the Mind of his Scholars and give that a right Disposition"  Ay there dear Sir is the Thing  "Which if once got tho' all the rest should be neglected"  charmingly observ'd  "would in  due time  "  without wicked Dice I hope  "produce all the rest and which if it be not got and settled so as to keep out ill and vicious Habits  Languages  and  Sciences  and all the other Accomplishments of Education will be to no Purpose but to make the worse or more dangerous Man"  Now comes the Place I am so much delighted with  "And indeed whatever Stir there is made about getting of  Latin  as the great and difficult Business his Mother"  O thank you thank you dear Sir for putting this excellent Author into my Hands  "may teach it him herself if she will but spend two or three Hours in a Day with  him"  If she will Never fear dear Sir but I will with the highest Pleasure in the World  "and make him read the Evangelists in  Latin  to her"  How I long to be five or six Years older as well as my dearest Babies that I may enter upon this charming Scheme  "For she need but buy a  Latin  Testament and having got somebody to mark the last Syllable but one where it is long in Words above two Syllables which is enough to regulate her Pronunciation and Accenting the Words read daily in the Gospels and then let her avoid understanding them in  Latin  if she can"  Why dearest dear Sir you have taught me almost all this already and you my best and most beloved Tutor have told me often I read and pronounce  Latin  more than tolerably tho' I don't understand it But this Method will teach  me  as well as your dear  Children  But thus the good Gentleman proceeds  "And when she understands the Evangelists in  Latin  let her in the same manner read  Aesop  's Fables and so proceed on to  Eutropius Justin  and such other Books I do not mention this"  adds Mr  Locke    "as an Imagination of what I fansy  may  do but as of a thing I have  known  done and the  Latin  Tongue got with Ease this way"  Mr  Locke  proceeds to mention other Advantages which the Child may receive from his Mother's Instruction which I will endeavour more and more to qualify myself for Particularly after he has intimated That  "At the same time the Child is learning  French  and  Latin  he may be enter'd also in Arithmetick Geography Chronology History and Geometry too for if"  says he  "these be taught him in  French  or  Latin  when he begins once to understand either of these Tongues he  will get a Knowlege in these Sciences and the Language to boot"  After he has intimated this I say he proceeds  "Geography I think should be begun with For the learning of the Figure of the Globe the Situation and Boundaries of the Four Parts of the World and that of particular Kingdoms and Countries being only an Exercise of the Eyes and Memory a Child with Pleasure will learn and retain them And this is so certain that I now live in an House with a Child whom his MOTHER has so well instructed this way in Geography"  But had she not do you think dear Sir some of this good Gentleman's kind Assistance as he liv'd in the House with the Child  "that he knew the Limits of the Four Parts of the World would readily point being ask'd to any Country upon the Globe or any County in the Map of  England  knew all the great Rivers Promontories Streights and Bays in the World and could find the Longitude and Latitude of any Place before he was six Years old"  There's for you dear SirSee what a Mother can do if she pleases  I remember Sir formerly in that sweet  See  Vol II  p    Chariot Conference at the Dawning of my Hopes when all my Dangers were over a Conference I still think of with Pleasure that you ask'd me how I would bestow my Time supposing the neighbouring Ladies would be above being seen in my Company when I should have no Visits to receive or return no Parties of Pleasure to join in no Cardtables to imploy my Winter Evenings  I then Sir transported with my opening Prospects prattled to you how well I would endeavour to pass my Time in the Family Management and Accounts in Visits nowandthen to the indigent and worthy Poor in Musick sometimes in Reading in Writing in my superior DutiesAnd I hope I have not behaved quite unworthily of my Promises  But I also remember dear Sir what  now  that the fair Prospect is no longer distant and that I have been so long your happy thrice happy Wife I may speak without those Blushes which then cover'd my Face that you said with a modest Grace and with that virtuous Endearment that is so  beautiful  in  your  Sex as well as  becoming  in  ours  whether in the Character of Lover or Husband Maiden or Wife  "And I hope my  Pamela  to have superadded to all these such an Imployment"  asin short Sir I am now bless'd with and writing of no less than the useful Part I may be able to take in the first Education of your lovely Babies  And now I must add That this pleasing Hope sets me above all other Diversions I wish for no Parties of Pleasure but with you my dearest Mr  B  and these are Parties that will improve me and make me more capable of the other and more worthy of your Conversation and of the Time you pass beyond what I could ever have promised to my utmost Wishes in such poor Company as mine for no other Reason but because I love to be instructed And take my Lessons well as you are pleas'd to say And indeed I must be a sad Dunce if I did not from so beloved a Master  I want no Cardtable Amusements For I hope there's a proud Hope in a few Years to be able to teach my dear Littleones the First Rudiments  as Mr  Locke  points the Way of  Latin  of  French  and of Geography and Arithmetick  O my dear Mr  B  by your Help and Countenance what may I not be able to teach them and how may I prepare the Way for a Tutor's Instructions and give them up Minds half cultivated to their HandsAnd all this time improve myself too not only in Science but in Nature by tracing in the little Babes what all Mankind are and have been from Infancy to riper Years and watching the sweet Dawnings of Reason and delighting in every bright Emanation of that Ray of Divinity lent to the human Mind for great and happy Purposes when rightly pointed and directed  There is no going further in this Letter after these charming Recollections and Hopes For they bring me to that grateful Remembrance to whom under GOD I owe them all and also what I have been for so happy a Period and what I am which is what will be ever my Pride and my Glory and well it may when I look back to my Beginning which I ever shall with humble Acknowlegement and can call myself dearest Mr  B  Your honoured and honouring and I hope I may say in time useful Wife  P B  LETTER LVIII  My dearest Mr  B  HAving in my former Letters said as much as is necessary to let you into my Notion of the excellent Book you put into my Hands and having  touch'd those Points in which the Children of both Sexes may be concern'd with some  Art  in my Intention I own in Hopes that they would not be so much out of the way as to make you repent of the Honour and Pleasure you have done me in committing the dear Miss  Goodwin  to my Care I shall now very quickly set myself about the little Book which I have done myself the Honour to mention to you  You have been so good as to tell me at the same time that you have not disapprov'd these my Specimen Letters as I may call them that you will kindly accept of my intended Present and you encourage me to proceed in it and as I shall leave one Side of the Leaf blank for your Corrections and Alterations those Corrections will be a fine Help and Instruction to me in the pleasing Task which I propose to myself of assisting in the early Education of the dear Children which it has pleased God to give you And altho' I shall be Years in writing it perhaps as the dear Babies improve and as I improve by the Opportunities which their Advances in Years will give me and the Experience I shall gain I shall perhaps venture to give my Notions and Observations on the more material and nobler Parts of Education as well as the inferior for but that I think the Subjects above my present Abilities Mr  Locke  's Book would lead me into several Remarks that might not be unuseful and which appear to me intirely new tho' that may be owing to my slender Reading and Opportunities perhaps  But what my dearest Mr  B  I would now touch upon is a Word or two still more particularly upon the Education of my own Sex a Topick which naturally rises to me from the Subject of my last Letter For there dear Sir we saw that  the Mothers might teach the Child this Part of Science and that Part of Instruction and who I pray as our Sex is generally educated shall teach the  Mothers  How in a Word shall they come by their Knowlege  I know you'll be apt to say That Miss  Goodwin  gives all the Promises of a fine young Lady and takes her Learning and loves Reading and makes very pretty Reflections on all she reads and asks very pertinent Questions and is as knowing at her Years as most young Ladies This is very true Sir but it is not every one that can boast Miss  Goodwin  's Capacity and Goodness of Temper which have enabled her to get up a good deal of lost Time as I must call it for the first four Years in the dear Child were a perfect Blank as far as I can find just as if the pretty Dear was born the Day she was four Years old For what she had to  unlearn  as to Temper and Will and such things set against what little Improvements she had made might very fairly be compounded for as a Blank  I would indeed have a Miss brought up to her Needle but I would not have  all  her Time imploy'd in Samplers and learning to mark and to do those unnecessary things which she will never probably be call'd upon to practise  And why pray my dear Mr  B  are not Girls intitled to the same first Education tho' not to the same Plays and Diversions as Boys so far at least as it is supposed by Mr  Locke  a Mother can instruct them  Would not this lay a Foundation for their future Improvement and direct their Inclinations to useful Subjects such as should make them above the Imputations of some unkind Gentlemen who allot to their Parts common Teatable Prattle while they  do all they can to make them fit for nothing else and then upbraid them for it And would not the Men find us better and more suitable Companions and Assistants to them in every useful Purpose of LifeO that your lordly Sex were all like my dear Mr  B  I don't mean that they should all take raw uncouth unbred lowly Girls as I was from the Cottage and destroying all Distinction make such their Wives I cannot mean this Because it is a far greater Likelihood that such an one when she comes to be lifted up into so dazzling a Sphere would have her Head made giddy with her Exaltation than that she would balance herself well in it And then to what a Blot over all the fair Page of a long Life would this little Drop of dirty Ink spread itself What a standing Disreputation to the Choice of a Gentleman  But  this  I mean that after a Gentleman had enter'd into the Marriage State with a young Creature saying nothing at all of Birth or Descent far inferior to him in Learning in Parts in Knowlege of the World and in all the Graces that make Conversation agreeable and improving he would as you do endeavour to make her fit Company for himself as he shall find she is  willing  to improve and  capable  of Improvement That he would direct her Taste point out to her proper Subjects for her Amusement and Instruction travel with her nowandthen a Month in a Year perhaps and shew her the World after he has encourag'd her to put herself forward at his own Table and at the Houses of his Friends and has seen that she will not do him great Discredit anywhere What Obligations and Opportunities too will this give her to love and honour such an Husband every Hour more and more as she will see his Wisdom  in a thousand Instances and experience his Indulgence to her in ten thousand for which otherwise no Opportunity could have so fitly offer'd to the Praise of his Politeness and the Honour of them bathAnd then when select Parties of Pleasure or Business engag'd him not abroad in his home Conversation to have him as my dear Mr  B  does delight to instruct and open her Prospects and inspire her with an Ambition to inlarge her Mind and more and more to excel What an intellectual Kind of marry'd Life as I may call it would such Persons find theirs And how suitable to the Rules of Policy and Selflove in the Gentleman For is not the Wife and are not her Improvements all  his own Absolutely  as I may say  his own  And does not every Excellence she can be adorned by redound to her Husband's Honour because she is  his  even more than  to her own  In like manner as no Dishonour affects a Man so much as that which he receives from a bad Wife  But where would some say were they to see what I write is such a Gentlemen as Mr  B  to be met with Look around and see with all the Advantages of Sex of Education of Travel of Conversation in the open World where a Gentleman of his Abilities to instruct and inform is to be found And there are others who perhaps will question the Capacities and Inclinations of our Sex in general to improve in useful Knowlege were they to meet with such kind Indulgers either in the Characters of a Parent or Husband  As to the first I grant that it is not easy to find such a Gentleman But for the second would it be excus'd in me who am one of the Sex and so may be thought partial to it I could by Comparisons drawn from the Gentlemen and Ladies within  the Circle of my own Acquaintance produce Instances to the Advantage of Ladies which are so flagrantly in their Favour that might make it suspected that it is Policy more than Justice in those who would keep our Sex unacquainted with that more eligible Turn of Education which gives the Gentlemen so many Advantages over us in  that  and which will shew that they have none at all in  Nature  or  Genius    I know you'll pardon me dear Sir for you are so exalted above your  Pamela  by Nature and Education too that you cannot apprehend any Inconvenience from bold Comparisons I will take the Liberty therefore to mention a few Instances among our Friends where the Ladies notwithstanding their more cramp'd and confin'd Education make more than an equal Figure with the Gentlemen in all the graceful Parts of Conversation in Spite of the Contempts pour'd out upon our Sex by some witty Gentlemen whose Writings I have in my Eye  To begin then with Mr  Murray  and Miss  Darnford  that was Mr  Murray  has the Reputation of Scholarship and has travell'd too but how infinitely is he surpass'd in every noble and useful Quality and in Greatness of Mind and Judgment as well as Wit by the young Lady I have nam'd This we saw when last at the Hall in Fifty Instances where the Gentleman was you know Sir on a Visit to Sir  Simon  and his Lady  Next dear Sir permit me to observe that my good Lord  Davers  with all his Advantages born a Counsellor of the Realm and educated accordingly does not surpass his Lady your noble Sister  My  Countess as I delight to call her and Lady  Betty  her eldest Daughter greatly surpass the Earl and my Lord her eldest Brother in every Point of  Knowlege and even Learning as I may say altho' both Ladies owe that Advantage principally to their own Cultivation and Acquirement  Let me presume Sir to name Mr  H  and when I  have  nam'd him shall we be puzzled to find anywhere in our Sex one Remove from vulgar Life a Woman that will not outdo Mr  H  Lady  Darnford  upon all useful Subjects makes a much brighter Figure than Sir  Simon  whose Knowlege of the World has not yet made him acquainted with himself  Mr  Arthur  excels not his Lady  Mrs  Towers  a Maiden Lady is an Overmatch for half a dozen of the neighbouring Gentlemen I could name in what is call'd Wit and Politeness and not inferior to any of them in Judgment  I could multiply Instances of this Nature were it needful to the Confutation of that low and I had almost said  unmanly  Contempt with which a certain celebrated Genius treats our Sex in general in most of his Pieces that I have seen particularly in his  Letter of Advice to a newmarry'd Lady  A Letter written in such a manner as must disgust instead of instructing and looks more like the Advice of an Enemy to the Sex and a partial one too than a Friend to the particular Lady But I ought to beg Pardon for this my Presumption for two Reasons first Because of the truly admirable Talents of this Writer and next Because we know not what Ladies the ingenious Gentleman may have fallen among in his younger Days  Upon the Whole therefore I conclude That Mr  B  the nobleminded Mr  B  is almost the only Gentleman who excels  every  Lady I have seen so  greatly  excels that even the Emanations of his Excellence irradiate a low Cottageborn Girl and make her pass among Ladies of Birth and Education for Somebody  Forgive my Pride dear Sir but it would be almost a Crime in your  Pamela  not to glory in the mild Benignity of those Rays by which her beloved Mr  B  endeavours to make her look up to his own funny Sphere while she by the Advantages only of his reflected Glory in his Absence which makes a dark Night to her glides along with her paler and fainter Beaminess and makes a distinguishing Figure among such lesser Planets as can only poorly twinkle and glimmer for want of the Aids she boasts of Tho' after all her silvery Lustre is easily overshadow'd by those crossing Clouds that make his Glory shine the brighter  I dare not dear Sir conjecture whence arises this more than Parity in the Genius of the Sexes among the Persons I have mention'd notwithstanding the Disparity of Education and the Difference in the Opportunities of each It might lead one into too proud a Thought in Favour of a Sex too contemptuously treated by some  other  Wits I might name who indeed are the less to be regarded as they love to jest upon all God Almighty's Works Yet might I better do it too than any body since as I have intimated above I am so infinitely transcended by my dear Gentleman that no Competition Pride or Vanity could be apprehended from me  But however I would only beg of the Gentlemen who are so free in their Contempts of us that they will for  their own  sakes and that with such generally goes a great way rather try to  improve  than  depreciate  us We shall then make better Daughters better Wives better Mothers and better Mistresses And who permit me Sir to ask these People would be so much the better for these Opportunities and Amendments as our Upbraiders themselves  On reperusing what I have written I must repeatedly beg your Excuse dear Sir for these proud Notions in behalf of my Sex I can truly say That they are not if I know myself owing to Partiality because I have the Honour to be one of it but to a better Motive by far For what does this contemptuous Treatment of one Half if not the better Half of the human Species naturally produce but Libertinism and abandon'd Wickedness For does it not tend to make the Daughters the Sisters the Wives of Gentlemen the Subjects of profligate Attempts Does it not render the Sex vile in the Eyes of the most Vile And when a Lady is no longer beheld by such Persons with that Dignity and Reverence with which perhaps the Graces of her Person and the Innocence of her Mind should sacredly as it were encompass her do not her very Excellencies become so many Incentives for base Wretches to attempt her Virtue and bring about her Ruin  What then may not wicked Wit have to answer for when its Possessors prostitute it to such unmanly Purposes And as if they had never had a Mother a Sister a Daughter of their own throw down as much as in them lies those sacred Fences which may lay the fair Inclosure open to the Invasions of every clumsier and viler Beast of Prey who tho' destitute of  their  Wit yet corrupted by it shall fill their Mouths as well as their Hearts with the borrow'd Mischief and propagate it from one to another to the End of Time and who otherwise would have pass'd by the uninvaded Fence and only shew'd their Teeth and snarl'd at the wellsecured Fold within it  You cannot my dearest Mr  B  I know you cannot be angry at this Romantick Painting since you are not affected by it For when you were at worst you acted more dangerously 'tis true for  the poor Innocents a  principal  Part and were as a Lion among Beasts Do dear Sir let me say  among  this one time You scorn'd to borrow any Man's Wit  See  Vol II  p    and if nobody had follow'd your Example till they had had your Qualities the Number of Rakes would have been but small Yet dearest Sir don't mistake me neither I am not so mean as to bespeak your Favour by extenuating your Failings If I  were  you would deservedly despise me For undoubtedly I  must  say it Sir your Faults were the greater for your Perfections and such Talents misapply'd as they made you more capable of Mischief so did they increase the Evil of your Practices All then that I mean by saying you are not affected by this Painting is that you are not affected by the Description I have given of clumsy and sordid Rakes whose  Wit  is  borrow'd  and their  Wickedness  only what they may call  their own    Then dear Sir since that noble Conversation which you held with me at  Tunbridge  in relation to the Consequences that might had it not been for GOD's Grace intervening have follow'd the Masquerade Affair I have the Pleasure the inexpressible Pleasure to find a thorough Reformation from the  best  Motives taking Place and your joining with me in my Closet as Opportunity permits in my Evening Duties is the charming Confirmation of your kind and voluntary and I am proud to say your  pious  Assurances So that this makes me fearless of your Displeasure while I rather triumph in my Joy for your precious Soul's sake than presume to think of recriminating and when only this one time for all and for ever I take the Liberty of looking back from the delightful  Now  to the painful  Formerly  But what a Rambler am I again You command me Sir to write to you all I think without Fear I obey and as the Phrase is do it without either  Fear  or  Wit    If you  are not  displeas'd it is a Mark of the true Nobleness of your Nature and the Sincerity of your late pious Declarations  If  you are  I shall be sure I have done wrong in having apply'd a Corrosive to eat away the  Proud Flesh  of a  Wound  that is not yet so throughly  digested  as to bear a painful Application and requires Balsam and a gentler Treatment But when we were at  Bath  I remember what you said once of the Benefit of Retrospection and you charg'd me when ever a  proper  Opportunity offer'd to remind you by that one Word  Retrospection  of the charming Conversation we had there on our Return from the Rooms  If this be not one of those  proper  Opportunities forgive dearest Sir the Unseasonableness of your very impertinent but in Intention and Resolution  Ever dutiful  P B  LETTER LIX From Mrs  B  to her Father and Mother  Ever dear and Ever honoured  I Must write this one Letter to you altho' I have had the Happiness to see you so lately because Mr  B  is now about to honour me with the Tour he so kindly promised to me when with you and  it may therefore be several Months perhaps before I have again the Pleasure of paying you the like dutiful Respects  You know his kind Promise That he would for every dear Baby I present him with take an Excursion with me afterwards in order to establish and confirm my Health  The Task I have undertaken of dedicating all my Writing Amusements to the dearest of Gentlemen the full Imployment I have when at home the frequent Rambles he has been so often pleas'd to indulge me in with my dear Miss  Goodwin  to  Kent  to  London  to  Bedfordshire  to  Lincolnshire  and to my Lady  Davers  's take from me the Necessity of writing to your honoured Selves to my Miss  Darnford  that was and to Lady  Davers  so often as I formerly thought myself obliged to do when I saw all my worthy Friends so seldom the same things moreover occurring this Year as to our Conversations Visits Friends Imployments and Amusements with little Variation that fell out the last as they must do in a Family so uniform and methodical as ours  I have for these Reasons more Leisure to pursue my domestick Duties which are increas'd upon me and when I have said That I am every Day more and more happy in my beloved Mr  B  in Miss  Goodwin  my  Billy  and my  Davers  and now newly in my sweet little  Pamela  for so you know Lady  Davers  would have her called rather than by her own Name what can I say more  As to the Tour I spoke of you know the first Part of Mr  B  's obliging Scheme is to carry me to  France  for he has already travell'd with me over the greatest Part of  England  and I am sure by my Passage last Year to the  Isle of Wight  I shall not be afraid of crossing the Water from  Dover  thither and he will when we are at  Paris  he says take  my  further Directions that was his kind Expression whither to go next  My Lord and Lady  Davers  are so good as to promise to accompany us to  Paris  provided Mr  B  will give them his and my Company to  Aix la Chapelle  for a Month or six Weeks whither my Lord is advised to go And Mr  H  if he can get over his Fear of crossing the salt Water  See  Vol III  p    is to be of the Party  Lady G Miss  Darnford  that was who likewise has lately lain in of a fine Daughter and I are to correspond as Opportunity offers and she is so good as to promise to send to you what I write as formerly But I have refused to say one Word in my Letters of the Manners Customs Curiosities  c  of the Places we see because first I shall not have Leisure and next because those things are so much better described in Books already printed written by Persons who made stricter and better Observations than I can pretend to make So that what I shall write will relate only to our private Selves and shall be as brief as possible  If we are to do as Mr  B  has it in his Thought he intends to be out of  England  two Years But how can I bear that if for your sakes only and for those of my dear Babies But this must be my Time my  only  Time Mr  B  tells me to ramble and see distant Places and Countries for he is pleas'd to say That as soon as his Littleones are capable of my Instructions and begin to understand my Looks and Signs he will not spare me from them a Week together and he is so kind as to propose that my dear bold Boy for every one sees how greatly he resembles his Papa in his dear forward Spirit shall go with us and this pleases Miss  Goodwin  highly who is very fond of  him  and my little  Davers  but vows she will never love so well my little blackey'd  Pamela    You see what a sweet Girl Miss is and you admir'd her much Did I tell you what she said to me when first she saw you both with your silver Hairs and reverend Countenances Madam said she I dare say your Papa and Mamma  honoured their Father and Mother  They did my Dear but what is your Reason for saying so Because reply'd she  they have lived so long in the Land which the Lord their God has given them  I took the dear Charmer in my Arms and kiss'd her three or four times as she deserv'd for was not this very pretty in the Child  I must with inexpressible Pleasure write you Word how happily GOD's Providence has turn'd for the best that Affair which once made me so uneasy in relation to the fine Countess who is gone abroad of whom you and my Father had heard as you told me some Reports which had you known at the Time would have made you very apprehensive for Mr  B  's Morals as well as for my Repose  I will give you the Particulars of this dark Affair so far as shall make you Judges of my present Joy  There was but one thing wanting my dear Parents to complete all the Happiness I wish'd for in this Life and that was the remote Hope I had entertain'd that one Day my dear Mr  B  who from a licentious Gentleman became a Moralist would be so touch'd by the Divine Grace as to become in time more than a Moral a  Religious  Gentleman and that he would at last join in the Duties which he had the Goodness to countenance  For this Reason I began with mere  Inidispensables  I crouded not his Gate with Objects of Charity I visited them at their Homes and reliev'd them distinguishing the worthy Indigent made so by unavoidable  Accidents and Casualties from the wilfully or perversly or sottishly such by  greater  Marks of my Favour  I confin'd my Morning and Evening Devotions to my own Closet as privately as possible lest I should give Offence and Discouragement to so gay a Temper so unaccustom'd poor Gentleman to Acts of Devotion and Piety while I met his Houshold together only on Mornings and Evenings of the Sabbathday to prepare them for their publick Duties in the one and in hopes to confirm them in what they had heard at Church in the other leaving them to their own Reflections for the rest of the Week after I had suggested to them a Method I wish'd to be follow'd by themselves and in which they constantly obliged me  This good Order had its desired Effect and our Sabbathday Assemblies were held with so little Parade that we were hardly any of us miss'd All in short was done with chearful Ease and Composure and every one of us was better dispos'd to our domestick Duties by this Method I to attend the good Pleasure of my best Friend and they to attend that of us both  In this manner we went on very happily my neighbourly Visits of Charity taking up no more Time than common Airings and passing many of them for such my  private Duties  being only between my FIRST my HEAVENLY BENEFACTOR and myself and my Family ones personally confin'd to the Day separated for these best of Services And Mr  B  pleas'd with my Manner beheld the good Effects and countenanc'd me by his Praises and his Endearments  as  acting discreetly as not falling into Enthusiasm and as he used to say  as  not aiming at being  righteous overmuch    But still I wanted and I waited for with humble Impatience and I made it part of my constant  Prayers that the Divine Grace would at last touch his Heart and make him  more  than a Countenancer  more  than an Applauder of my Duties That he might for his own dear sake become a Partaker a Partner in them and then thought I when we can Hand in Hand Heart in Heart one Spirit as well as one Flesh join in the same Closet in the same Prayers and Thanksgivings what an happy Creature shall I be  I say  Closet  for I durst not aspire so high as to hope he would favour me with his Company among his Servants in our  Sunday  Devotions I knew it would be going too far in  his  Opinion to expect it from him In  me  their Mistress had I been ever so highborn it was not amiss because I and they  every one  of us were  his  I in one Degree Mr  Longman  in another Mrs  Jervis  in anotherBut from a Gentleman of his lordly Temper and manner of Education I knew I could never hope for it so would not lose  every  thing by grasping at  too much    But in the midst of all these comfortable Proceedings and my further charming Hopes a nasty Masquerade threw into the dear Gentleman's Way a Temptation that for a time blasted all my Prospects and indeed made me doubt my own Head almost For judge what my Disappointment must be when I found all my Wishes frustrated all my Prayers render'd ineffectual His very Morality which I had flatter'd myself in time I should be an humble Instrument to exalt into a religious Frame of Mind shock'd and in Danger and all the good Work to begin again if offended Grace should ever again offer itself to the dear wilful Trespasser  But who shall pretend to scrutinize the Councils of the Almighty For out of this  evil Appearance  was to proceed the  real Good  I had been so long and so often supplicating for  The dear Gentleman  was  to be on the Brink of relapsing It was proper that I should be so very uneasy as to assume a Conduct not natural to my Temper and to raise his generous Concern for me And in the very Crisis Divine Grace interposed made him sensible of his Danger made him resolve against his Error before it was yet too late and his sliding Feet quitting the slippery Path he was in collected new Strength and he stood the firmer and more secure for his Peril  For my dear Parents having happily put an End to that Affair he was pleas'd when we were at  Tunbridge  together and in very serious Discourse on divine Subjects to say to this Effect Is there not my  Pamela  a Text  That the unbelieving Husband shall be saved by the believing Wife while he beholds her chaste Conversation coupled with Fear  I need not tell you my dear Mr  B  that there is nor where it is  Then my Dear I begin to hope that will be my Case For from a late Affair of which this Spot of Ground puts me more in mind I see so much Reason to doubt my own Strength which I had built and as I thought securely on  moral  Foundations that I must look out for a  better  Guide to conduct me than the proud Word  Honour  can be in the general Acceptation of it among us lively young Gentlemen  How often my dearest Love continued he have I promised and I never promised but I intended to perform that I would be faithfully and only yours How often have I declar'd that I did not think I could possibly deserve my  Pamela  till I could shew her in my own Mind a Purity as nearly equal to hers as my past Conduct would admit of  But I depended too much upon my own Strength And I am now convinc'd that nothing but RELIGIOUS CONSIDERATIONS and a Resolution to watch over the very  first  Appearances of Evil and to check them as they arise can be of sufficient Weight to keep steady to his good Purposes a young vain Mind  too  little accustom'd to Restraint and too much us'd to play upon the Brink of Dangers from a Temerity and Love of Intrigue too natural to enterprising Minds  You shall therefore my  Pamela  from this Instant be my Guide and only taking care that you do not all at once by too  rigorous  Injunctions damp and discourage the rising Flame I will leave it to you to direct it as you please till by degrees it may be deem'd worthy to mingle with your own  Judge my dear Parents how rapturous my Joy was upon this Occasion and how ready I was to bless GOD for a Danger so narrowly escap'd which was attended with the  very  Consequences that I had so long pray'd for and which I little thought the Divine Providence was bringing about by the very Means that I apprehended would put an End to all my pleasing Hopes and Prospects of that Nature  It is in vain for me to think of finding Words to express what I felt and how I acted on this Occasion I heard him out with twenty different and impatient Emotions and then threw myself at his Feet embracing his Knees with Arms the most ardently clasping My Face lifted up to Heaven and to his dear Face by Turns my Eyes overflowing with Tears of Joy which half choak'd up the Passage of my Words At last his kind Arms clasping my Neck and kissing my tearful Cheek I could only say My Prayers my ardent Prayers are at last at last heard May GOD Almighty dear  Sir confirm your pious Purposes And Oh what an happy  Pamela  have you at your Feet  I wept for Joy till I sobb'd again and he raising me to his kind Arms when I could speak I said To have this  heavenly  Prospect O best Beloved of my Heart added to all my  earthly  Blessings how shall I contain my Joy For Oh to think that my dear Mr  B  is and will be mine and I' his thro' the Mercies of GOD when this transitory Life is past and gone to all Eternity what a rich Thought is this Methinks I am already dear Sir ceasing to be mortal and beginning to taste the Perfection of those Joys which this thrice welcome Declaration gives me Hope of hereafter But what shall I say oblig'd as I was beyond Expression before and now doubly oblig'd in the rapturous View you have open'd to me into an happy Fururity  He was pleas'd to say He was delighted with me beyond Expression that I was his ecstatick Charmer That the Love I shew'd for his future Good was the moving Proof of the Purity of my Heart and my Affection for him And that very Evening he was pleas'd to join with me in my retired Duties and at all proper Opportunities favours me with his Company in the same manner listening attentively to all my Lessons as he calls my fond chearful Discourses on serious Subjects  And now my dear Parents do you not rejoice with me in this charming charming Appearance For  before  I had the most generous the most beneficent the most noble the most affectionate but  now  I am likely to have the most  pious  of Husbands What an happy Wife what an happy Daughter is  his  and  your Pamela  GOD of his infinite Mercy continue and improve the ravishing Prospects  I was forc'd to leave off here to enjoy the charming Reflections which this lovely Subject and my blessed Prospects filled me with And now proceed to write a few Lines more  I am under some Concern on account of our going to travel into  Romancatholick  Countries for fear we should want the publick Opportunities of Divine Service For I presume the Embassador's Chapel will be the only Protestant Place of Worship allow'd of and  Paris  the only City in  France  where there is one But we must endeavour to make it up in our private and domestick Duties For as the Phrase is when we are at  Rome  we must do as they do at  Rome  that is to say so far as not to give Offence on one hand to the People we are among nor Scandal on the other by Compliances hurtful to one's Conscience But my Protector knows all these things so well no Place in what is called the Grand Tour being new to him that I have no Reason to be very uneasy on these Accounts  And now my dearest dear honoured Parents let me by Letter as I did on my Knees at Parting beg the Continuance of your Prayers and Blessings and that GOD will preserve us to one another and give us and all our worthy Friends a happy Meeting again  Kent  you may be sure will be our first Visit on our Return for your sakes for my dear  Davers  's sake and for my little  Pamela  's sake who will be both sent down and put into your Protection while my  Billy  and Miss  Goodwin  for since I began this Letter it is so determin'd are to be my delightful Companions for Mr  B  declar'd His Boy shall not be one Day out of my Presence if he can  help it because he is pleased to say his Temper wants looking after and his Notices of every thing are strong and significant  Poor little Dear he has indeed a little sort of Perverseness and Headstrongness as one may say in his Will But he is but a Baby and I shall I hope manage him pretty well for he takes great Notice of all I say and of every Look of mine already He is besides very goodhumour'd and willing to part with any thing for a kind Word and this gives me Hope of a docile and benevolent Disposition as he grows up  I thought when I began the last Paragraph but one that I was within a Line of concluding but it is  to  You and  of  my Babies I am writing so shall go on to the Bottom of this new Sheet if I do not directly put an End to my Scribbling Which I do with assuring you both my dear good Parents that whereever I am I shall always be thoughtful of you and remember you in my Prayers as becomes  Your ever dutiful Daughter  P B  My Respects to all your good Neighbours in general Mr  Longman  will visit you nowandthen Mrs  Jervis  will take one Journey to  Kent  she says and it shall be to accompany my Babies when they are carried down to you Poor  Jonathan  and she good Folks seem declining in their Health which much grieves me Once more GOD send us all an happy Meeting if it be his blessed Will Adieu Adieu my dear Parents  Your ever dutiful  c  LETTER LX  My dear Lady  G  I Received your last Letter at  Paris  as we were disposing every thing for our Return to  England  after an Absence of near Two Years in which as I have inform'd you from time to time I have been a great Traveller into  Holland  the  Netherlands  through the most considerable Provinces of  France  into  Italy  and in our Return to  Paris  again the principal Place of our Residence through several Parts of  Germany    I told you of the Favours and Civilities we receiv'd at  Florence  from the then Countess Dowager of who with her Humble Servant Lord  C  that had so assiduously attended her for so many Months in  Italy  accompany'd us from  Florence  to  Inspruck    Her Ladyship made that worthy Lord happy in about a Month after she parted from us and the noble Pair gave us an Opportunity at  Paris  in their Way to  England  to return some of the Civilities which we receiv'd from them in  Italy  And they are now arriv'd at her Ladyship's Seat on the Forest  Her Lord is exceedingly fond of her▪ as he well may for she is one of the most charming Ladies in  England  and behaves to him with so much Prudence and Respect that they are as happy in each other as can be wish'd And let me just add That both in  Italy  and at  Paris  Mr  B  's Demeanour and her Ladyship's to one another was so nobly open and unaffectedly polite as well as highly discreet that neither Lord  C  who had once been jealous of Mr  B  nor the  other Party  who had  had a Tincture of the same Yellow Evil as you know because of the Countess had so much as a Shadow of Uneasiness remaining on that Occasion  Lord  Davers  has had his Health which had begun to decline in  England  so well that there was no persuading Lady  Davers  to return before now altho' I begg'd and pray'd I might not have another little  Frenchman  for fear they should as they grew up forget as I pleasantly used to say the Obligations which their Parentage lays them under to dearer  England    And now my dearest Friend I have shut up my Rambles for my whole Life for Three little  English  Folks and One little  Frenchman  but a charming Baby as well as the rest  Charley  by Name and a near Prospect of a further Increase you will say are Family enough to employ all my Cares at home  I have told you from time to time altho' I could not write to you so often as I would because of our being so constantly in Motion what was most worthy of your Knowlege relating to our Particular and how happy we have all been in one another And I have the Pleasure to confirm to you what I have several times written that Mr  B  and my Lord and Lady  Davers  are all that I could wish and hope for with regard to their first Duties Indeed indeed we are an happy Family united by the best and most solid Motives  Miss  Goodwin  is a charming young Lady I cannot express how much I love her She is a perfect Mistress of the  French  Language and speaks  Italian  very prettily And as to myself I have improved so well under my dear Tutor's Lessons together with the Opportunity of conversing with the politest and most learned Gentry of different Nations that I will hold a Conversation with you in  two or three Languages if you please when I have the Happiness to see you There's a learned Boaster for you my dear Friend if the Knowlege of different Languages makes one learned But I shall bring you an Heart as intirely  English  as ever for all that  We landed on  Thursday  last at  Dover  and directed our Course to the dear Farmhouse and you can better imagine than I express what a Meeting we had with my dear Father and Mother and my beloved  Davers  and  Pamela  who are charming Babies But is not this the Language of every fond Mamma  Miss  Goodwin  is highly delighted now with my sweet little  Pamela  and says She shall be her Sister indeed For Madam said she Miss is a BeautyAnd we see no  French  Beauties like Master  Davers  and Miss  Beauty my dear Miss  Goodwin  said I what is Beauty if she be not a good Girl Beauty is but a specious and as it may happen a dangerous Recommendation a mere skindeep Perfection and if as she grows up she is not as good as my Miss  Goodwin  she shall be none of my Girl  What adds to my Pleasure my dear Friend is to see them both so well got over the Smallpox It has been as happy for them as it was for their Mamma and her  Billy  that they had it under so skilful and kind a Manager in that Distemper as my dear Mother I wish if it please GOD it was as happily over with my little pretty  Frenchman    Every body is surpris'd to see what the past two Years have done for Miss  Goodwin  and my  Billy  O my dear Friend they are both of them almostnay quite I think for their Years all that I wish them to be  In order to make them keep their  French  which Miss so well speaks and  Billy  so prettily prattles I make them when they talk to one another and  are in the Nursery speak nothing else But at Table except on particular Occasions when  French  may be spoken they are to speak in  English  that is to say when they  do  speak For I tell them that little Masters must do nothing but ask Questions for Information and say Yes or No till their Papa's or Mamma's give them Leave to speak nor little Ladies neither till they are Sixteen for my dear Loves cry I You would not speak before you know  how  And Knowlege is obtain'd by  Hearing  and not by  Speaking  And setting my  Billy  on my Lap in Miss's Presence Here said I taking an Ear in the Fingers of each Hand are two Ears my  Billy  and then pointing to his Mouth but one Tongue my Love So you must be sure to mind that you  hear  twice as much as you  speak  even when you grow a bigger Master than you are now  You have so many pretty Ways to learn one Madam says Miss nowandthen it is impossible we should not regard what you say to us  Several  French  Tutors when we were abroad were recommended to Mr  B  But there is one  English  Gentleman now on his Travels with young Mr  R  with whom Mr  B  has agreed and in the mean time my best Friend is pleas'd to compliment me that the Children will not suffer for want of a Tutor while I can take the Pains I do Which he will have to be too much for me especially that now on our Return my  Davers  and my  Pamela  are added to my Cares But what Mother can take too much Pains to cultivate the Minds of her Children If my dear Lady  G  it were not for these  frequent  Lyingsin But this is the Time of Life Tho' little did I think so early I should have so many careful Blessings  I have as great Credit as Pleasure from my little Family All our Neighbours here in  Bedfordshire  admire us more and more You'll excuse my seeming for it is but seeming Vanity I hope I know better than to have it realNever says Mrs  Towers  who is still a single Lady did I see before a Lady so much advantag'd by her Residence in that fantastick Nation for she loves not the  French  and who brought home with her nothing of their Affectations She will have it that the  French  Politeness and the  English  Frankness and Plainness of Heart appear happily blended in all we say and do And she makes me a thousand Compliments upon Lord and Lady  Davers  's Account who she would fain persuade me owe a great deal of Improvement my Lord in his Conversation and my Lady in her Temper to living in the same House with us  Indeed my Lady  Davers  is exceeding kind and good to me is always magnifying me to every body and says she knows not how to live from me and that I have been a Means of saving half an hundred Souls as well as her dear Brother's On an Indisposition of my Lord's at  Montpelier  which made her Ladyship very apprehensive she declar'd that were she to be depriv'd of his Lordship she would not let us rest till we had consented to permit her to live with us saying that we had Room enough in  Lincolnshire  and she would inlarge the  Bedfordshire  Seat at her own Expence  Mr  H  is Mr  H  still and that's the best I can say of him For I verily think he is more an Ape than ever His  whole  Head is now  French  'Twas  half  so before We had great Difficulties with him abroad His Aunt and I endeavouring to give him a serious and religious Turn we had like to have turn'd him into a  Roman  Catholick For he was pleased much with the shewy Part of that Religion and the fine Pictures and Decorations in the Churches of  Italy  and having got into Company with a  Dominican  at  Padua  a  Franciscan  at  Milan  and a  Jesuit  at  Paris  they lay so hard at him in their Turns that we had like to have lost him to each Assailant so were forced to let him take his own Course for his Aunt would have it that he had no other Defence from the Attacks of Persons to make him embrace a faulty Religion than to permit him to continue as he was that is to say to have none at all So she suspended attempting to proselyte the thoughtless Creature till he came to  England  I wish her Ladyship Success here but I doubt he will not be a Credit to any Religion for a great while And as he is very desirous to go to  London  as he has always been it will be found when there that any fluttering Coxcomb will do more to make him one of that Class in an Hour than his Aunt's Lessons to make him a good Man in a Twelvemonth  Where much is given much is required  The contrary of this I doubt is all poor Mr  H  has to trust to  Just now we have a Messenger to tell us that his Father who has been long ill is dead So now he is a Lord indeed He flutters and struts about most strangely I warrant and is wholly imploy'd in giving Directions relating to his Mourning Equipage And now there will be no holding of him in I doubt except his new Title has so much Virtue in it as to make him a wiser and a better Man  He will now have a Seat in the House of Peers of  Great Britain  but I hope for the Nation's sake he will not meet with many more like himself there For to me that is one of the most venerable Assemblies in the World and it appears the more so since I have been abroad for an  English  Gentleman is respected if he be any thing of a Man above a foreign Nobleman and an  English  Nobleman above some petty Sovereigns  If our travelling Gentry duly consider'd this Distinction in their Favour they would for the Honour of their Country as well as for their own Credit behave in a better manner in their foreign Tours than I am sorry to say it some of them do But what can one expect from the unlick'd Cubs pardon the Term sent abroad with only Stature to make them look like Men and Equipage to attract Respect without one other Qualification to inforce it  Here let me close this with a few Tears to the Memory of my dear Mrs  Jervis  my other Mother my Friend my Adviser my Protectress in my single State and my faithful Second and Partaker in the Comforts of my higher Life and better Fortunes  What would I have given to have been present as it seems she so earnestly wished to close her dying Eyes I should have done it with the Piety and the Concern of a truly affectionate Daughter But that melancholy Happiness was deny'd to us both for as I told you in the Letter on the Occasion the dear good Woman who now is in the Possession of her blessed Reward and is rejoicing in God's Mercies was no more when the News reached me so far off as at  Heidelburgh  of her last Illness and Wishes  I cannot forbear every time I enter her Parlour where I used to see with so much Delight the good Woman sitting always imploy'd in some useful or pious Work shedding a Tear to her Memory And in my Sabbath Duties missing  her  I miss half a dozen Friends methinks and I sigh in Remembrance of her and can only recover that chearful Frame which the Performance of those Duties always gave me by reflecting that she now is reaping the Reward of that sincere Piety which us'd to edify and encourage us all  The Servants we brought home with us and those we left behind us met in Tears at the Name of Mrs  Jervis  Mr  Longman  lamented too in the most moving Strain her Loss And all I can do now in Honour of her Memory and her Merit is to be a Friend to those she lov'd most as I have already begun to be and none of them shall suffer in those Concerns that can be answer'd now she is gone For the Loss of so excellent a Friend and Relation is Loss enough to all that knew her and claim'd Kindred with her  Poor worthy  Jonathan  too 'tis almost a Misery to have so soft so susceptible an Heart as I have or to have such good Servants and Friends as one cannot lose without such Emotions as I feel for their Loss his Silver Hairs which I have beheld with so much Delight and thought I had a Father in Presence when I saw them adorning so honest and comely a Face how are they now laid low Forgive me my dear Lady  G Jonathan  was not a common Servant neither are  any  of ours so But  Jonathan  excell'd all that excell'd in his Class I am told That these two worthy Folks dy'd within two Days of one another a Circumstance you mention'd not in your Letter to me on which Occasion I could not help saying to myself in the Words of  David  over  Saul  and his Son  Jonathan  the Namesake of our worthy Butler  They were lovely and pleasant in their Lives and in their Deaths they were not divided    I might have continu'd on in the Words of the Royal Lamenter for surely never did one Fellowservant love another in my Maiden State nor Servant love a Mistress in my exalted Condition better than  Jonathan  lov'd me I could see in his Eyes a glistening Pleasure whenever I pass'd by him If at such times I spoke to him as I seldom fail'd to do  with a  God bless you too  in Answer to his repeated Blessings he had a kind of Rejuvenescence may I say visibly running thro' his whole Frame And nowandthen if I laid my Hand upon his folded ones as I pass'd him on a  Sunday  Morning or Evening praying for me with a  How do you my worthy old Acquaintance  his Heart would spring to his Lips in a kind of Rapture and his Eyes would run over  O my beloved Friend how the Loss of these two Worthies of my Family oppresses me at times  Mr  B  likewise shew'd a generous Concern on the Occasion And when all the Servants welcom'd us in a Body on our Return Methinks my Dear said the good Gentleman I miss your Mrs  Jervis  and honest  Jonathan  A starting Tear and They are happy dear honest Souls and a Sigh were the Tribute I paid to their Memories on their beloved Master's so kindly repeating their Names  Who knows had I been here But away too painful Reflection They liv'd to a good old Age and fell like Fruit fully ripe They  died the Death of the Righteous  I must follow them in time God knows how soon And  Oh that my latter End may be like theirs  Once more forgive me my dear Friend this small Tribute to their Memories And believe that I am not so ungrateful for God's Mercies as to let the Loss of these dear good Folks lessen with me the Joy and the Delight I have still more than any other happy Creature left me in the Health and the Love of the best of good Husbands and good Men in the Children charming as ever Mother boasted charming I mean principally in the dawning Beauties of their Minds and in the Pleasure their Towardliness of Nature gives me including as I always do and have Reason to do from her dutiful Love as  I may call it for me and Observation of all I say to her my dear Miss  Goodwin  in the Preservation to me of the best and worthiest of Parents hearty tho' aged as they are in the Love and Friendship of good Lord and Lady  Davers  and my excellent Friend Lady  G  God preserve all these to me not forgetting the worthy Mr  Longman  as I am truly thankful for His Mercies And then notwithstanding my affecting Losses as above who will be so happy as I  That you my dear Lady  G  may long continue so likewise in the Love of a worthy Husband and the Delights of an increasing hopeful Family which will make you some Amends for the heavy Losses you also have sustain'd in the two last Years of an affectionate Father and a most worthy Mother and in Mrs  Jones  of a good Neighbour prays  Your ever affectionate Friend and Servant  P B  LETTER LXI  My beloved Lady  G  YOU will excuse my long Silence when you are  reminded  of the Occasions to which it has been owing for some of them you know and when you are  told  the others  In the first Place I was oblig'd to pay a dutiful and concerning Visit to  Kent  where my good Father was taken ill of a Fever and my Mother of an Ague And think Madam how this must affect me from their Time of Life O Death Death thou mayst knock at the Doors of Tenements so frail but so beloved We cannot help ourselves But we will not let thee in if we can possibly avoid it for the Lives of such dear Parents are a Part of  my own Life And if God see fit I cannot spare them Indeed I cannot  Mr  B  kindly accompany'd me apprehending that his beloved Presence would be necessary if that Recovery of them both in which I thankfully rejoice had not taken Effect especially as a Circumstance I am I think  always  in added more Weight to his Apprehensions  I had hardly return'd from  Kent  to  Bedfordshire  and look'd round when I was oblig'd to set out to attend Lady  Davers  who sent me word that she should  die  that was her strong Term if she saw me not to comfort and recover by my Counsel and Presence so sshe was pleas'd to express herself her sick Lord who was just got out of an intermittent Fever which left him without any Spirits and was occasion'd by fretting at the Conduct of her  stupid Nephew  those also were her Words  For you must have heard Everybody hears when Man of Quality does a foolish Thing and it has been in all the Newspapers That  'On  Wednesday  last the Right Honourable  John Jackey  they should have said Lord  H  Nephew to the Right Honourable  William  Lord  Davers  was marry'd to the Honourable Mrs  P  Relict of  J P  of  Twickenham    Esq  a Lady of celebrated Beauty and ample Fortune'  Now my dear Friend you must know that this celebrated Lady is 'tis true of the Family whence her Title of  Honourable  but is indeed so  celebrated  that every fluttering Coxcomb in Town can give some Account of her even before she was in Keeping of the Duke of who had cast her off to the Town he had robb'd of her  In short my Dear she is quite a common Woman has no Fortune at all as one may say only a small Jointure incumber'd and is much in DebtShe  is a Shrew into the Bargain and the poor Wretch is a Father already for he has had a Girl of Three Years old her Husband has been dead Seven brought him home which he knew nothing of nor ever inquir'd If his Widow had a Child And he is now imploy'd in paying the Mother's Debts and trying to make the best of his Bargain  This is the Fruit of a  London  Journey so long desir'd by him and his Fluttering about there with his new Title  He was drawn in by a Brother of his Lady and a Friend of that Brother's two Town Sharpers Gamesters and BulliesPoor Sir  Joseph Wittol  That was his Case and his Character it seems in  London    Shall I present you with a Curiosity 'Tis a Copy of his Letter to his Uncle who had as you may well think lost all Patience with him on occasion of this abominable Folly  My Lord  DAVERS  'FOR if you will not call me Nephew I have no Reason to call you Uncle Surely you forget who it was you held up your Cane to I have as little Reason to value your Displeasure as you have me for I am God be thanked a Lord and a Peer of the Realm as well as you And as to your not owning me nor your Brother  B  not looking upon me I care not a Farthing and bad as you think I have done I have marry'd a Woman of Family Take that among you  'As to your personal Abuses of her take care what you say You know the Statute will defend us as well as you And besides she has a Brother that won't let her good Name be call'd in Question Mind that  'Some Things I wish had been otherwise Perhaps I do What then Must you my Lord make more Mischief and add to my Plagues if I have any Is this your Uncleship  'But I sha'n't want your Advice I have as good an Estate as you have and am as much a Lord as yourself Why the Devil then am I to be treated as I am Why the Plague But I won't swear neither I desire not to see you any more than you do me I can tell you that And if we ever meet under one Roof with my Liking it must be at the House of Peers where I shall be upon a Par with you in every thing that's my Comfort  'As to my Lady  Davers  I desire not to see her Ladyship for she was always plaguy nimble with her Fingers but let my false Step be what it will I have in other respects marry'd a Lady who is as well descended as herself and no Disparagement neither so have not that to answer for to her Pride and who has as good a Spirit too if they were to come Face to Face or I am mistaken Nor will she take Affronts from any one So my Lord leave me to make the best of my Matters as I will you of yours So no more but that I am  '  Your Servant  'H  '  P S  I mean no Affront to Mrs  B  She is the best of ye allby G'  I will not take up your Time with further Observations upon this poor Creature's bad Conduct His Reflection must proceed from  Feeling  and will that's the worst of it come too late come  when  or  how  it will I will only say I am sorry for it on his own Account but more for that of Lord and Lady  Davers  who take the Matter very heavily and wish he had marry'd the lowestborn Creature in  England  so she had been honest and virtuous rather than done as he has done  But I suppose the poor Gentleman was resolv'd to shun at all Adventures Mr  B  's Fault and keep up to the Pride of Descent and Family and so marry'd the  only  Creature as I hope since it cannot be help'd that is so great a Disgrace to both For I presume to flatter myself for the sake of my Sex that among the poor Wretches who are sunk so low as the TownWomen are there are very few of Birth or Education but such principally as have had their Necessities or their Ignorance taken Advantage of by base Men since Birth and Education must needs set the most unhappy of the Sex above so sordid and so abandon'd a Guilt as the hourly Wickedness of such a Course of Life subjects them to  But let me pursue my Purpose of excusing my long Silence I had hardly return'd from Lord and Lady  Davers  's and recover'd my Family Management and resum'd my Nursery Duties when my Fourth dear Boy my  Jemmy  for I think I am going on to make out the Number Lady  Davers  allotted  See this  Vol  p    me press'd upon me in such a manner as not to be refus'd for one Month or Six Weeks close Attention And then a Journey to Lord  Davers  's and that noble Pair accompanying us to  Kent  and daily and hourly Pleasures crouding upon us narrow and confin'd as our Room there was tho' we went with as few Attendants as possible took up  more  of my Time So that I hope you will forgive me on all these Accounts because as soon as I return'd I set about writing this as an Excuse for myself in the first place to promise you the Subject you insist upon  in the next and to tell you that I am incapable of Forgetfulness or Negligence to such a Friend as Lady G For I must always be dear Madam  Your faithful and affectionate humble Servant P B  LETTER LXII  My dear Lady  G  THE Remarks which your Cousin  Fielding  tells you I have made on the Subject of young Gentlemens Travelling and which you request me to communicate to you are Part of a little Book upon Education which I wrote for Mr  B  's Correction and Amendment on occasion of his putting Mr  Locke  's Treatise on that Subject into my Hands and requiring my Observations upon it  I cannot flatter myself that they will answer your Expectation for I am sensible they must be unworthy even of the Opportunities I have had in the Excursions in which I have been indulg'd by the best of Gentlemen  But your Requests are so many Laws to me and I will give you a short Abstract of what I read to Miss  Fielding  who has so greatly overrated it to you  That Gentleman's Book contains many excellent Rules on the Subject of Education But this of Travel I will only refer you to at present You will there see his Objections against the Age at which young Gentlemen are sent abroad from Sixteen to Twentyone the Time in all their Lives he says in which young Men are the least suited to these Improvements and in which they have the least Fence and Guard against their Passions  The Age he proposes is from Seven to Fourteen because of the Advantage they will then have to master Foreign Languages and to form the Tongue to their true Accents as well as that then they will be easier directed by their Tutors or Governors Or else he proposes that more sedate Time of Life when the Gentleman is able to travel without a Tutor and to make his own Observations and when he is thoroughly acquainted with the Laws and Fashions the natural and moral Advantages and Defects of his own Country by which means as Mr  Locke  wisely observes the Traveller will have something to exchange with those abroad from whose Conversation he hopes to reap any Knowlege This Gentleman supports his Opinion by excellent Reasons to which I refer you  What I have written in my little Book which I have not yet quite finish'd on  this  Head relates principally to  Home Travelling  which Mr  B  was always resolv'd his Sons should undertake before they enter'd upon a Foreign Tour I have there observ'd That  England  abounds with Curiosities both of Art and Nature worth the Notice of a diligent Inquirer and equal with some of those we admire in Foreign Parts and that if the Youth be not sent abroad at Mr  Locke  's earliest Time from Seven to Fourteen which I can hardly think will be worth while merely for the sake of attaining a Perfection in the Languages he may with good Advantage begin at Fourteen or Fifteen the Tour of  Great Britain  nowandthen by Excursions in the Summer Months between his other Studies and as a Diversion to him  This I should wish might be enter'd upon in his Papa's Company as well as his Tutor's if it could conveniently be done who thus initiating both the Governed and the Governor in the Methods he  would have observ'd by both will obtain no small Satisfaction and Amusement to himself  For the Father would by this means be an Eyewitness of the Behaviour of the one and the other and have a Specimen how fit the young Man was to be trusted or the Tutor to be depended upon when  they  went abroad and were out of his Sight as  they  would of what was expected from them by the Father And hence a thousand Benefits as I humbly conceive would arise to the young Gentleman from the Observations and Reflections he would receive from his Father as Occasion offer'd with regard to Expence Company Conversation Hours and suchlike  If the Father could not himself accompany his Son he might appoint the Stages the young Gentleman should take and injoin both Tutor and Son to give at every Stage an Account of whatever they observed curious and remarkable not omitting the minutest Occurrences travelling Expences  c  By this means and the Probability that he might hear of them and their Proceedings from his Friends Acquaintance and Relations who might fall in with them or at whose Seats they might sometimes be entertained they would know the Inspection they were under and have a greater Regard to their Conduct  By seeing thus the different Customs Manners and Oeconomy of different Persons and Families for in so mix'd a Nation as ours is there is as great a Variety of that sort to be met with as in most and from their different Treatment at their several Stages a great deal of the World may be learn'd by the young Gentleman He would be prepar'd to go abroad with more Delight to himself as well as more Experience and greater Reputation to his Family and Country In such Excursions as these  the Tutor would see the Temper and Inclination of the young Gentleman and might give proper Notices to the Father if any thing was amiss that it might be set right while the Youth was yet in his Reach and more under his Inspection than he would be in a foreign Country And the Observations the young Gentleman would make at his Return as well as in his Letters▪ would shew how fit he was to be trusted and how likely to improve when at a greater Distance  After  England  and  Wales  as well the inland Parts as the Seacoasts let them if they behave according to Expectation take a Journey into  Scotland  and  Ireland  and visit the principal Islands as  Guernsey Jersey  c the young Gentleman continuing to write down his Observations all the way and keeping a Journal of Occurrences And let him imploy the little Time he will be on board of Ship in these small Trips from Island to Island or Coastwise in observing upon the noble Art of Navigation of the Theory of which it will not be amiss that he has some Notion as well as of the curious Structure of a Ship its Tackle and Furniture A Knowlege very far from being insignificant to a Gentleman who is an Islander and has a Stake in the greatest maritime Kingdom in the World and hence he will be taught to love and value that most useful and brave Set of Men the  British  Sailors who are the natural Defence and Glory of the Realm  Hereby he will confirm his Theory of the Geography of the  British  Dominions in  Europe  He will be appris'd of the Situation Conveniencies Interests and Constitution of his own Country and will be able to lay a Groundwork for the future Government of his Thoughts and Actions if the Interest he bears in his native Country should call  him to the publick Service in either House of Parliament  With this Foundation how excellently would he be qualify'd to go abroad and how properly then would he add to the Knowlege he had attain'd of his own Country that of the different Customs Manners and Forms of Government of others How would he be able to form Comparisons and to make all his Inquiries appear pertinent and manly All the Occasions of that ignorant Wonder which renders a Novice the Jest of all about him would be taken away He would be able to ask Questions and to judge without Leadingstrings Nor would he think he has seen a Country and answer'd the Ends of his Father's Expence and his own Improvement by running thro' a Kingdom and knowing nothing of it but the Inns and Stages at which he stopp'd to eat and drink For on the contrary he would make the best Acquaintance and contract worthy Friendships with such as would court and reverence him as one of the rising Genius's of his Country  Whereas most of the young Gentlemen who are sent abroad raw and unprepar'd as if to wonder at every thing they see and to be laugh'd at by all that see them do but expose themselves and their Country And if at their Return by Interest of Friends by Alliances or Marriages they shall happen to be promoted to Places of Honour or Profit their unmerited Preferment will only serve to make those Foreigners who were Eyewitnesses of their Weakness and Follies when among them conclude greatly in Disfavour of the whole Nation or at least of the Prince and his Administration who could find no fitter Subjects to distinguish  This my dear Friend is a brief Extract from my Observations on the Head of qualifying young Gentlemen to travel with Honour and Improvement  I doubt you'll be apt to think me not a little out of my Element but since you  would  have it I claim the Allowances of a Friend to which my ready Compliance with your Commands the rather intitles me  I am very sorry Mr and Mrs  Murray  are so unhappy in each other Were he a generous Man the heavy Loss the poor Lady has sustained as well as her Sister my beloved Friend in so excellent a Mother and so kind a Father would make him bear with her Infirmities a little  But really I have seen on Twenty Occasions that notwithstanding all the fine Things Gentlemen say to Ladies before Marriage if the latter do not  improve  upon their Husbands Hands their imputed Graces when single will not protect them from Indifference and probably from worse While the Gentleman perhaps thinks  he  only of the Two is intitled to go backward in Acts of Kindness and Complaisance A strange and a shocking Difference which too many Ladies experience who from fond Lovers prostrate at their Feet find surly Husbands trampling upon their Necks  You my dear Friend were happy in your Days of Courtship and are no less so in your State of Wedlock And may you continue to be so to a good old Age prays  Your affectionate and faithful Friend  P B  LETTER LXIII  My dear Lady  G  I WILL chearfully cause to be transcribed for you the Conversation you desire between myself Mrs  Towers  and Mrs  Arthur  and the Three young  Ladies their Relations in Presence of the Dean and his Daughter and Mrs  Brooks  and glad I shall be if it may be of Use to the two thoughtless Misses your Neighbours who you are pleased to tell me are great Admirers of my Story and my Example and will therefore as you say pay greater Attention to what I write than to the more passionate and interested Lessons of their Mamma  I am only forty that you should have been under any Concern about the supposed Trouble you give me by having mislaid my former Relation of it For besides obliging my dear Lady  G  the Hope that I may be able to do Service by it to a Family so worthy in a Case so nearly affecting its Honour as to make two headstrong young Ladies recollect what belongs to their Sex and their Characters and what their filial Duties require of them affords me high Pleasure and if it shall be attended with the wish'd Effects it will be an Addition to my Happiness  I said cause to be transcribed because I hope to answer a double End by it for after I had reconsider'd I set Miss  Goodwin  to transcribe it who writes a very pretty Hand and is not a little fond of the Task and indeed of any Task I set her and will be more affected as she  performs  it than she could be by  reading  it only altho' she is a very good Girl at present and gives me Hopes that she will continue to be so  As soon as it is done I will inclose it that it may be read to the Parties without this Introduction if you think fit And you will forgive me for having added a few Observations to this Transcription with a View to the Cases of your inconsiderate young Ladies and for having corrected the former Narrative in several Places  My dear Lady  G  THE Papers you have mislaid relating to the Conversation between me and the young Ladies Relations of Lady  Towers  and Lady  Arthur  in Presence of these two lastnam'd Ladies Mrs  Brooks  and the worthy Dean and Miss  L  of which in order to perfect your kind Collection of my Communications you request another Copy contained as follows  I first began with apprising you that I had seen these three Ladies twice or thrice before as Visitors at their Kinswomens Houses so that they and I were not altogether Strangers to one another And my two Neighbours acquainted me with their respective Tastes and Dispositions and gave me their Histories preparative to this Visit to the following Effect  'That Miss STAPYLTON is overrun with the Love of Poetry and Romance and delights much in flowery Language and metaphorical Flourishes Is about Eighteen wants not either Sense or Politeness and has read herself into a Vein that is more amorous that was Lady  Towers  's Word than discreet Has extraordinary Notions of a  Firstsight  Love and gives herself greater Liberties with a Pair of fine Eyes in hopes to make sudden Conquests in pursuance of that Notion than is pretty in her Sex and Age which makes those who know her not conclude her bold and forward and is more than suspected with a Mind thus prepared for instantaneous Impressions to have experienc'd the Argument to her own Disadvantage and to be  struck  before she has  stricken  by a Gentleman whom her Friends think not at all worthy of her and to whom she was making some indiscreet Advances under the Name of PHILOCLEA to PHILOXENUS in a Letter which she intrusted  to a Servant of the Family who discovering her Design prevented her Indiscretion for that Time  'That in other respects she has no mean Accomplishments will have a fine Fortune is genteel in her Person tho' with some visible Affectation dances well sings well and plays prettily on several Instruments is fond of Reading but affects the Action and Air and Attitude of a Tragedian and is too apt to give an Emphasis in the wrong Place in order to make an Author mean more significantly than it is necessary he should even where the Occasion is common and in a mere historical Fact that requires as much Simplicity in the Reader's Accent as in the Writer's Style No Wonder then that when she reads a Play she will put herself into a Sweat as Lady  Towers  says distorting very agreeable Features and making a  Multitude  of wry Mouths with  one  very pretty one in order to convince her Hearers what a near Neighbour her Heart is to her Lips  'Miss COPE is a young Lady of Nineteen lovely in her Person with a handsome Fortune in Possession and great Prospects Has a soft and gentle Turn of Mind which disposes her to be easily imposed upon Is address'd by a Libertine of Quality whose Courtship while permitted was Imperiousness and Tenderness Insult having found the young Lady too susceptible of Impression open and unreserv'd and even valuing him the more as it seem'd for treating her with ungenerous Contempt for that she was always making Excuses for Slights Illmanners and even Rudeness which no other young Lady would forgive  'That this Facility on her Side and this Insolence on his and an overfree and even indecent Degree of Ramping as it is called with Miss which  once her Mamma surpris'd them in made her Papa forbid  his  Visits and  her  receiving them  'That this however was so much to Miss's Regret that she was detected in a Design to elope to him out of the private Gardendoor where in all Probability the indelicate and dishonourable Peer would have triumphed over her Innocence having given out since that he intended to revenge himself on the Daughter for the Disgrace he had received from the Parents  'That tho' she was convinc'd of this 'twas fear'd she still lov'd him and would throw herself in his way the first convenient Opportunity urging that his rash Expressions were the Effect only of his Passion for that she knows he loves her too well to be dishonourable to her And by the same Degree of favourable Prepossession she will have it That his brutal Roughness is the Manliness of his Nature That his most shocking Expressions are Sincerity of Heart That his Boasts of his former Lewdness are but Instances that he knows the World That his Freedoms with her Person are but Excess of Love and innocent Gaiety of Temper That his resenting the Prohibition he has met with and his Threats are other Instances of his Love and his Courage And Peers of the Realm ought not to be bound down by little narrow Rules like the Vulgar for truly their  Honour  which is regarded in the greatest Cases equal with the  Oath  of a common Gentleman is a Security that a  Lady  may trust to if he is not a Profligate indeed and that Lord  P cannot  be  'That excepting these Weaknesses Miss has many good Qualities is charitable pious humane humble sings sweetly plays on the Spinnet charmingly is meek fearful and never was resolute or courageous enough to step out of the regular Path  till her too flexible Heart became touch'd with a Passion that is said to tame Lions and therefore her rough Peer has none of it and animate the Dove and Miss  Cope  has too much of it  'That Miss SUTTON a young Lady of the like Age with the two former has too lively and airy a Turn of Mind affects to be thought well read in the Histories of Kingdoms as well as in polite Literature Speaks  French  fluently talks upon all Subjects much and has a great deal of that flippant Wit which makes more Enemies than Friends However is innocent and unsuspectedly virtuous hitherto but makes herself cheap and accessible to Fops and Rakes and has not the worse Opinion of a Man for being such Listens eagerly to Stories told to the Disadvantage of Individuals of her own Sex tho' affecting to be a great Stickler for the Honour of the Sex in general Will unpityingly propagate such Stories Thinks without considering to what the Imprudence of her own Conduct may subject her the Woman that slips inexcusable Asserts that it is the  Man's  Place  to ask  the  Woman's to deny  and by this means encourages the one in their vile Attempts and gives up the other for their Weakness in a kind of silly Affectation to shew her Security in her own Virtue at the very time that she is dancing upon the Edge of a Precipice presumptuously inattentive to her own Danger'  The worthy Dean knowing the Ladies Intention in this Visit to me brought his Daughter with him as if by Accident For Miss  L  with many good Qualities is of a remarkably soft Temper tho' not so inconsiderately soft as Miss  Cope  But is too credulous and as her Papa suspects entertains more than a Liking to a wild young Gentleman the  Heir to a noble Fortune who makes Visits to her full of Tenderness and Respect but without declareing himself This gives the Dean a good deal of Uneasiness and he is very desirous that Miss should be in my Company on all Occasions as she is so kind to profess a great Regard to my Opinion and Judgment  'Tis easy to see the poor young Lady is in Love and she makes no doubt that the young Gentleman loves  her  But alas why then for he is not a bashful Man as you shall hear does he not say soHe has deceived already two young Creatures His Father has caution'd the Dean against his Son Has told him that he is sly subtle full of Stratagem yet has so much Command of himself which makes him more dangerous as not to precipitate his Designs but can wait with Patience till he thinks himself secure of his Prey and then pulls off the Mask at once and if he succeeds glories in his Villainy  Yet does the Father beg of the Dean to permit his Visits for he would be glad he would marry Miss  L  tho' greatly unequal in Fortune to his Son wishing for nothing so much as that he  would  marry And the Dean owing his principal Preferment to the old Gentleman cares not to disoblige him or affront his Son without some apparent Reason for the latter especially as the Father is bound up in him all the Family Hopes depending upon him having no other Child and being himself half afraid of him lest if too much thwarted he should fly out intirely  So here Madam are Four young Ladies of like Years and different Inclinations and Tempers all of whom may be said to have Dangers to encounter with resulting from their respective Dispositions And who professing to admire my Character and  the Example I had set were brought to me to be benefited as Lady  Towers  was pleased to say by my Conversation And all was to be as if accidental none of them knowing how well I was acquainted with their respective Characters  How proud my dear Lady G would this Compliment have made me from such a Lady as Mrs  Towers  had I not been as proud as proud could be before in the good Opinion of four beloved Persons Mr  B  Lady  Davers  the Countess of  C  and your dear Self  We were attended only by  Polly Barlow  who was as much concern'd as any body in some of the Points that came before us And as you know this was in the Time of the Visit paid us by Lord and Lady  Davers  and that noble Countess 'tis proper to say they were abroad together upon a Visit from which knowing how I was to be engag'd they excus'd me  The Dean was well known to and valu'd by all the Ladies and therefore was no manner of Restraint upon the Freedom of our Conversation  I was above in my Closet when they came and Lady  Towers  having presented each young Lady to me when I came down said being all seated I can guess at your Imployment Mrs  B  Writing I dare say I have often wish'd you for a Correspondent for every one who can boast that Favour exalts you to the Skies and says Your Letters exceed your Conversation but I always insisted upon it that  that  was impossible  Lady  Towers  said I is always saying the most obliging Things in the world of her Neighbours But may not one suffer dear Madam for these kind Prepossessions in the Opinion of greater Strangers who will judge more impartially than your Favour will permit you to do  That said Lady  Arthur  will be so soon put out of Doubt when Mrs  B  begins to speak that we will refer to that and so put an End to every thing that looks like Compliment  But Mrs  B  said Lady  Towers  may one ask What particular Subject was at this Time your Imployment  I had been writing you must know Lady  G  for the sake of engaging Miss  Stapylton  's flowery Vein a little Sketch of the Style she is so fond of and hoped for some such Opportunity as this Question gave me to bring it on the Carpet for my only Fear with her and Miss  Cope  and Miss  Sutton  was that they would deem me too grave and so what should fall in the Course of Conversation would make the less Impression upon them For even the best Instructions in the world you know will be ineffectual if the Method of conveying them is not adapted to the Taste and Temper of the Person you would engage Whence as I take it that excellent Rule of the Apostle of  becoming all Things to all Men    I answer'd That I had been meditating upon the Misfortune of a fine young Lady who had been seduced and betrayed by a Gentleman she loved and who notwithstanding had the Grace to stop short indeed later than were to be wished and to abandon Friends Country Lover in order to avoid any further Intercourse with him and that God had blessed her Penitence and Resolution and she was now very happy in a neighbouring Dominion  A fine Subject said Miss  Stapylton  Was the Gentleman a Man of Wit Madam Was the Lady a Woman of Taste  The Gentleman Miss was all that was desirable in Man had he been virtuous The Lady all that  was excellent in Woman had she been more circumspect But it was a first Love on both Sides and little did she think he could have taken Advantage of her Innocence and her Affection for him  A sad sad Story said Miss  Cope  But pray Madam did their Friends approve of their Visits For Danger sometimes as I have heard arises from the Cruelty of Friends who force Lovers upon private and clandestine Meetings when perhaps there can be no material Objection why the Gentleman and Lady may not come together  Well observ'd Miss  Cope  thought I How we are for making every Case applicable to our own when our Hearts are fix'd upon a Point  It cannot be called  Cruelty  in Friends Miss said I when their Cautions or even  Prohibitions  are so well justify'd by the Event as in  this  Caseand  generally  by the wicked Arts and Practices of Seducers And how happy is it for a Lady when she suffers herself to be convinc'd that those who have lived  Forty  Years in the World may know twice as much at least of that World as she can possibly know at  Twenty  Ten of which moreover are almost a Blank If they do  not  the one must be supposed very ignorant the other very knowing  But Miss the Lady whose hard Case I was meditating  hop'd  too much and  fear'd  too little that was her Fault which made her give Opportunities to the Gentleman which neither  Liberty  nor  Restraint  could justify in her She had not the Discretion poor Lady in this one great Point of all that the Ladies I have in my Eye I dare say would have had in her Case  I beg Pardon said Miss and blush'd I know not the Case and ought to have been silent  Ay Miss thought I so you would had not you thought yourself more affected by it than were to be wish'd you were  I think said Miss  Sutton  the Lady was the less to be pity'd as she must know what her Character requir'd of her and that Men will deceive whereever they are trusted 'Tis  their  Place to ask a  Lady's  to deny  So Miss reply'd I you are supposing a continual State of War between the Two Sexes one offensive the other defensive And▪ indeed I think the Notion not amiss for a Lady will assuredly be less in Danger when she rather  fears  an  Enemy  than  hopes  a  Friend  where so much depends upon the Issue either of her Doubt or of her Confidence  I don't know  neither  Madam return'd Miss very briskly whether the Men should be set out to us as such Bugbears as our Mamma's generally represent them It is doing too much Honour to their Sex It is making them too considerable and is a kind of Reflection upon the Discretion and Virtue of our own supposing us weak indeed  The late Czar I have read continued Miss took a better Method with the  Swedes  who had often beat him when after a great Victory he made his Captives march in Procession thro' the Streets of his principal City to familiarize them to the  Russes  and shew them they were  but  Men  Very well observ'd Miss reply'd I But then did you not say that this was thought necessary to be done because the  Russes  had been often  defeated  by these  Swedes  and thought  too highly  of them and when the  Swedes  taking Advantage of that Prepossession had the  greater Contempt  for the  Russes  Miss looked a little disconcerted and being silent I proceeded  I am very far Miss from thinking the Generality of Men considerable if our Sex do Justice to themselves and to what their Characters require of them Nevertheless give me Leave to say that  the Men I thought altogether  inconsiderable  would not think worthy of my Company nor give it to them when I could avoid it For when once they are persuaded that it is their Privilege to  ask  and the Lady's only to  deny  it will certainly imbolden them to solicit and to think themselves acting in Character when they put the Lady upon exerting her less active Privilege And yet I am humbly of Opinion with the Poet  He comes  too near  who comes to be  deny'd    For these Reasons Miss I was pleased with your Notion that it would be best to look upon that Sex especially if we allow them the Privilege you speak of in an  hostile  Light  But permit me to observe with regard to the most contemptible of the Species Fops Coxcombs and pretty Fellows that many a  good  General has been defeated when trusting to his superior Strength and Skill he has despised a  truly weak  Enemy  I believe Madam return'd Miss your Observation is very just I have read of such Instances But dear Madam permit me to ask Whether we speak not too generally when we condemn every Man who dresses well and is not a Sloven as a Fop or a Coxcomb  No doubt we do when this is the Case But permit me to observe that you hardly ever in your Life Miss saw a Gentleman who was  very  nice about his Person and Dress that had any thing he thought of  greater  Consequence to himself to regard 'Tis natural it should be so for should not the Man of  Body  take the greatest Care to set out and adorn the Part for which he thinks himself most valuable And will not the Man of  Mind  bestow his principal Care in improving that Mind Perhaps to the Neglect of Dress and outward Appearance which  is a Fault But surely Miss there is a Middleway to be observ'd between both in these as in most other Cases for a Man need not be a Sloven any more than a Fop He need not shew a Contempt for Dress and yet not think Appearance his first and chief Concern be ready to quarrel with a high Wind for discomposing his Peruque or to put on his Hat for fear of depressing his Foretop be more afraid of a Spot upon his Cloaths than twenty in his Mind Be a Selfadmirer and always at the Glass which he would perhaps never look into could it shew him the Deformity of his Mind as well as the Finery of his PersonWho has a Tailor for his Tutor and a Milaner for his Schoolmistress who laughs at Men of Sense indeed excusably perhaps in Revenge because they laugh at him Who calls Learning Pedantry and looks upon the Knowlege of the Fashions as the only useful Science to a fine Gentleman  Pardon me Ladies I could proceed with the Character of this Species of Men but I need not because every Lady present I am sure would despise such an one as much as I do were he to fall in her way And the rather because it is a certain Fact that he who admires himself will never admire his Lady as he ought and if he maintains his Niceness after Marriage it will be with a Preference to himself against her If not will sink very probably into the worst of Slovens for the Mind that is capable of one Extreme in every Case of human Life almost when that goes off if not a Man of Prudence constitutionally in a manner falls into its Opposite  But to return to the former Subject for the general Attention encouraged me to proceed permit me Miss  Sutton  to add That a Lady must run great Risques to her Reputation if not to her Virtue  who will admit into her Company  any  Gentleman who shall be of Opinion and  know  it to be  hers  that it is  his  Province to ask a Favour that she thinks it becomes  her  to deny  I believe Madam said Miss I spoke these Words a little too generally But I meant  honourable  Questions to be sure  There can be but  one  honourable Question thought I and that is seldom asked but when the Affair is brought near a Conclusion and there is a Probability of its being granted and which a Single Lady while she has Parents or Guardians should never think of permitting to be put to herself much less of approving nor perhaps as the Case may be of denying but I would not push her too far altho' there was Room to have made the young Lady blush for her inconsiderate Notion  So I said I don't  doubt  Miss but you meant honourable Questions A young Lady of Miss  Sutton  's good Sense and worthy Character could not mean otherwise  And yet Miss appear'd to be under an agreeable Confusion every Lady by her Eye seeming to think she had met with a deserv'd Rebuke and which not seeming to expect it abated her Liveliness all the Time after and turn'd as I may say her  Tongue  into  Ear    Lady  Towers  seasonably reliev'd us both from a Subject too  applicable  if I may so express it saying But dear Mrs  B  will you favour us with the Result of your Meditation if you have committed it to Writing on the unhappy Case you mention'd  I was rather Madam exercising my Fancy than my Judgment such as it is upon the Occasion I was aiming at a kind of allegorical or metaphorical Style I know not which to call it and it is not fit to be read before such Judges I doubt  O pray dear Madam said Miss  Stapylton  favour us with it  to chuse  for I am a great Admirer of that Style  We shall never know half your Excellencies said Lady  Arthur  I have a great Curiosity both from the  Subject  and the  Style  to hear what you have written And I beg you will oblige us all  Do dear Madam said Miss  L  Do dear Mrs  B  said Lady  Towers  I beg it of you also said the Dean Do dear Madam let us have it said all the Ladies  It is short and unfinish'd It is design'd to be woven into a Letter to a dear Friend And let it be ever so censurable I should be  more  so if I made any Difficulties after such an unanimous Request So taking it out of my Lettercase I read as follows  "While the  Banks  of  Discretion  keep within their natural Chanel the  proud Waves  of  Passion  all calm and serene glides along the silver Current inlivening the adjacent Meadows as it passes with a brighter and more flowery Verdure But if the  Torrents  of  sensual Love  are permitted to descend from the  Hills  of  credulous Hope  they may so swell the gentle Stream as to make it difficult if not impossible to be retain'd in its usual Bounds What then will be the ConsequenceWhy the  Trees of Resolution  and the  Shrubs of cautious Fear  whose intertwining Roots had contributed to support the frail Mound being loosen'd from their Hold  they  and the  Bank  itself will be seen floating on the Surface of the triumphant Waters  "But here a dear Lady having unhappily failed is enabled to set her  Foot  in the  newmade  Breach while yet it is  possible  to stop it and to say with little Variation in the Language of that Power  which only could enable her to say it  Hither ye proud Waves of dissolute Love altho' you  HAVE  come yet no farther  SHALL  ye come  is such an Instance of magnanimous Resolution and Selfconquest as is very rarely to be met with"  They were all greatly taken with what I read and the Dean gave it Beauties by his kind Comments which he himself could hardly think it merited supposing no doubt that it might afford a Subject for the young Ladies to contemplate upon in their own Taste as one may say Miss  Stapylton  particularly appear'd so delighted with it that she desired a Copy of it and the other Three young Ladies complaisantly join'd in her Request  Whereupon I said That if it could have the Benefit of the Dean's Remarks upon it it would be worthy of their Acceptance But however it was at their Service for I had the rough Sketch of it above  Miss  Stapylton  took it promising to give each a Copy and honour'd it with a Place in her Bosom I mention this because it answer'd my End and slight as the Cause was gave the young flighty Ladies an high Opinion of me which made them listen with the greater Attention to all that succeeded  Our Conversation after this took a more general Turn as to the Air of it if I may say so Which I thought right lest the young Ladies should imagine it was a designed Thing against them But yet it was such that every one of them found her Character and Taste little or much concerned in it and all seem'd as Lady  Towers  afterwards observ'd to me by their Silence and Attention to be busied with private Applications  The Dean began first with a View to his own Daughter and seeing his Drift I humour'd it accordingly  and the rather as Miss  Cope  's Case was included in that of Miss  L  He was pleased to say That I seem'd design'd by Providence as a Model as well as an Exemplar for my Sex and it was Matter of great Surprize to him that my tender Years consider'd I should be capable of making those Reflections by which Persons of twice my Age and Experience might be instructed You see Madam said he how attentive we all are when your Lips begin to open and I beg we may have nothing to do but to  be  attentive  I have had such Advantages Sir reply'd I from the Observations and Cautions of my late excellent Lady that did you but know half of them you would rather wonder I had made  no greater  Improvement than that I have made  so much  She used to think me pretty and not illtemper'd and  of course  not incredulous where I conceived a good Opinion and was always arming me on that Side as believing I might be the Object of wicked Attempts and the rather as my low Fortunes subjected me to Danger For had I been born to Rank and Condition as these young Ladies here I should have had Reason to think of  myself  as justly as no doubt  they  do and of consequence beyond the Reach of any vile Intriguer as I should have been above the greatest Part of that Species of Mankind who for want of Understanding or Honour or thro' pernicious Habits give themselves up to Libertinism  Charming Humility said Miss  Cope  with her Hands lifted up So said Miss  Stapylton    These were great Advantages no doubt said Miss  Sutton  but in  you  they met with a surprising Genius 'tis very plain Madam and there is not in my Opinion a Lady in  England  of your Years who would have improv'd by them as you have done  I answer'd That I was much obliged to her for her good Opinion But that I had always observ'd that the Person who admir'd any good Qualities in another gave a kind of  natural  Demonstration that she had the same in an eminent Degree herself altho' perhaps her modest Diffidence would not permit her to trace the generous Principle to its Source  The Dean in order to bring us back again to our Subject repeated my Remark that it was safer in Cases where so much depended upon the Issue as a Lady's Honour and Reputation to  fear  an  Enemy  than to  hope  a  Friend  and praised my Observation that even a  weak  Enemy is not to be too much despised  I said I had very high Notions of the Honour and Value of my own Sex and very mean ones of the gay and frothy Part of the other insomuch that I thought they could have no Strength but what was founded in our Weakness That indeed the Difference of Education must give Men Advantages even where the Genius was naturally equal and among others Courage and Hardness of Hearts which make Ladies where they meet not with Men of Honour to engage upon very unequal Terms for that it was so customary with them to make Vows and Promises and to set so light by them  when made  that an innocent Lady cannot guard too watchfully against them and in my Opinion should believe nothing they said or even  vow'd  but what carry'd Demonstration with it  I remember continued I my Lady used often to observe That there was a Time of Life in all young Persons which might properly be called  The Romantick  which was a very dangerous Period and requir'd therefore a great Guard of Prudence That the Risque was not a little augmented by reading Novels and Romances and that the Poetical Tribe had much  to answer for on this Head by reason of their inflaming and unnatural Descriptions which did much Hurt to thoughtless Minds and lively Imaginations For to those she would have it were principally owing the Rashness and Indiscretion of even  soft  and  tender  Dispositions which in Breach of their Duty and even Decorum of Sex too frequently set them upon Enterprizes like what they have read in those pernicious Writings which not seldom make them fall a Sacrifice to the base Designs of some vile Intriguer and even in Cases where their Precipitation ends the best that is to say in  Marriage  they too frequently in direct Opposition to the Cautions and Commands of their  try'd  their  experienc'd  and  unquestionable  Friends throw themselves upon an  almost Stranger  who had he not been unworthy of them would not nor  needed  to have taken indirect Methods to obtain their Favour  And the Misfortune is continu'd I the most innocent are generally the most credulous They would do no Harm to others themselves and cannot think others would do them any And with regard to the particular Person who has obtain'd perhaps a Share in her Confidence  he  cannot surely she thinks be so  ingrateful  as to return Evil for Good Were all the Men in the World besides to prove false the  beloved  Person cannot 'Twould be unjust to  her own Merit  as well as to  his Vows  to suppose it And so  Design  on his Side and  Credulity  and  Selfopinion  on the Lady's at last inroll the unhappy Believer in the List of the toolate Repenters  And what Madam said the Dean has not that Wretch to answer for who makes Sport of destroying a virtuous Character and in being the wicked Means of throwing perhaps upon the Town and into the Dregs of Prostitution a poor Creature whose Love  for him and Confidence in him was all her Crime and who otherwise might have made a worthy Figure at the Head of some reputable Family propagating good Examples instead of Ruin and Infamy to Mankind and so have been an useful Member of the Commonwealth To say nothing of what is still worse the dreadful Crime of occasioning the Loss of a Soul since final Impenitence too genenerally follows the first Sacrifice which the poor Wretch is seduced to make of her Honour  There are several Gentlemen in our Neighbourhood said Mrs  Brooks  who might be benefited by this touching Reflection if it was represented in the same strong Lights from the Pulpit And permit me to say Mr Dean that I think you should give us a Sermon upon this Subject for the sake of both Sexes one for Caution the other for Conviction  I will think of it reply'd he But I am sorry to say that we have too many among our younger Gentry who would think themselves pointed at were I to touch this Subject ever so cautiously  I am sure said Lady  Towers  there cannot well be a more useful one and the very Reason the Dean gives is a convincing Proof of it to me  When I have had the Pleasure of hearing the further Sentiments of such an Assembly as this upon the delicate Subject reply'd this polite Divine I shall be better enabled to treat it And pray Ladies proceed for it is from your Conversation that I must take my Hints  You have nothing to do then said Lady  Towers  but to engage Mrs  B  to speak and you may be sure we will all be as attentive to  her  as we shall be to  you  when we shall have the Pleasure to hear so fine a Genius improving upon her Hints from the Pulpit  I bow'd as the Dean did to Lady  Towers  and knowing that she praised me so highly in order to  induce the young Ladies to give the greater Attention to what she wished I should speak I said It would be almost an unpardonable Presumption in me after so high a Compliment to open my Lips Nevertheless as I was sure by speaking I should have the Benefit of Instruction whenever it made  them  speak I would not be backward to enter upon any Subject for that I should consider myself as a young Counsel in some great Cause who served but to open it and prepare the Way for those of greater Skill and Abilities  I beg then Madam said Miss  Stapylton  you will  open the Cause  be the Subject what it will And I could almost wish that we had as many Gentlemen here as Ladies who would have Reason to be asham'd of the Liberties they take in censuring the Conversations of the Teatable since the Pulpit as the worthy Dean gives us Reason to hope may be beholden to that of Mrs  B  Nor is it much Wonder reply'd I when the Dean himself is with us and it is grac'd by so charming and distinguish'd a Circle  If many of our young Gentlemen were here said Lady  Towers  they might improve themselves in all the Graces of polite and sincere Complaisance But compar'd to this I have generally heard such trite and coarse Stuff from our Race of Wou'dbewits that what they say may be compar'd to the Fawnings and Salutations of the Ass in the Fable who emulating the Lapdog merited a Cudgel rather than Encouragement  But Mrs  B  continued she begin I pray you to  open  and  proceed  in the Cause for there will be no Counsel imploy'd but you I can tell you  Then give me a Subject that will suit me Ladies and you shall see how my Obedience to your Commands will make me run on  Will you Madam said Miss  Stapylton  give us a few Cautions and Instructions on a Theme of your own That a young Lady should rather  fear  too much than  hope  too much A necessary Doctrine perhaps but a difficult one to be practised by a Lady who has begun to love and supposes all Truth and Honour in the Object of her Favour  Hope  Miss said I in my Opinion should never be unaccompany'd by  Fear  and the more Reason will a Lady ever have to fear and to suspect herself and doubt her Lover when she once begins to find in her own Breast a Favour for him For then her Danger is doubled since she has  herself  perhaps the more dangerous Enemy of the two to guard against as well as  him    She may secretly hope the best indeed but what  has been  the Fate of others  may be  her own and tho' she thinks it not  probable  from such a faithful Protester as he appears to her to be yet while it is  possible  she should never be off her Guard Nor will a prudent Woman trust to his Mercy or Honour but to her own Discretion and the rather because if he mean well he  himself  will value her the more for her Caution since every Man desires to have a virtuous and prudent Wife if not well she will detect him the sooner and so by her Prudence frustrate all his base Designs  The Ladies seeming by their Silence to approve what I said I proceeded  But let me my dear Ladies ask What that Passion is which generally we dignify by the Name of  Love  and which when  so  dignify'd puts us upon a thousand Extravagancies I believe if it were to be examined into it would be found too generally to owe its Original to  ungovern'd Fancy  and were we to judge of it by the Consequences that usually attend it it ought rather to be called  Rashness Inconsideration Weakness    any thing but  Love  for very seldom I doubt is the  solid Judgment  so much concern'd in it as the  airy Fancy  But when once we dignify the wild Misleader with the Name of  Love  all the Absurdities which we have read in Novels and Romances take Place and we are induc'd to follow Examples that seldom end happily but in  them    But permit me further to observe that Love as we call it operates differently in the Two Sexes as to its Effects For in Woman it is a  creeping  Thing in Man an  Incroacher  and this ought in my humble Opinion to be very seriously attended to Miss  Sutton  intimated thus much when she observ'd that it was the Man's Province to ask the Lady's to deny Excuse me Miss the Observation was just as to the Mens Notions altho' methinks I would not have a Lady allow of it except in Cases of Caution to themselves  The Doubt therefore proceeded I which a Lady has of her  Lover's  Honour is needful to preserve  her own  and  his  too And if she does him Wrong and he should be too just to deceive her she can make him Amends by Instances of greater Confidence when she pleases But if she has been accustom'd to grant him little Favours can she easily recal them and will not the  Incroacher  grow upon her Indulgence pleading for a Favour Today which was not refused him Yesterday and reproaching her want of Confidence as a want of Esteem till the poor Lady who perhaps has given way to this  creeping insinuating  Passion and has avow'd her Esteem for him puts herself too much in his Power in order to manifest as she thinks the  Generosity  of her Affection and so by Degrees is carry'd farther than she intended or nice Honour ought to have permitted and all because to keep up to my Theme she  hopes  too much and  doubts  too little And  permit me Ladies to add That there have been Cases where a Gentleman himself pursuing the Dictates of his  incroaching  Passion and finding a Lady  too conceding  has taken Advantages that probably at first he did not presume to think of  Miss  Stapylton  said That  Virtue  itself spoke when I spoke and she was resolv'd when she came home to recollect as much of this Conversation as was possible and write it down in her Commonplace Book where it would make a better Figure than any thing she had there  I suppose Miss said Lady  Towers  your chief Collections are Flowers of Rhetorick pick'd up from the  French  and  English  Poets and Novelwriters I would give something for the Pleasure of having it two Hours in my Possession  Fie Madam reply'd Miss a little abash'd How can you expose your Kinswoman thus before the Dean and Mrs  B  Lady  Towers  Miss said I only says this to provoke you to shew your Collections I wish I had the Pleasure of seeing them I doubt not but your Commonplace Book is a Storehouse of Wisdom  There is nothing bad in it I hope said Miss but I would not that Mrs  B  should see it for the World But let me tell you Madam to Lady  Towers  there are many beautiful Things and good Instructions to be collected from Novels and Plays and Romances and from the poetical Writers particularly light as you are pleased to make of them Pray Madam to me have you ever been at all conversant in such Writers  Not a great deal Miss there were very few Novels and Romances that my Lady would permit me to read and those I did gave me no great Pleasure for either they dealt so much in the  Marvellous  and  Improbable  or were so unnaturally  inflaming  to the  Passions  and so full of  Love  and  Intrigue  that hardly any of them but seem'd calculated to  fire  the  Imagination  rather than to  inform  the  Judgment  Tilts and Tournaments breaking of Spears in Honour of a Mistress swimming of Rivers engaging with Monsters rambling in Search of Adventures making unnatural Difficulties in order to shew the KnightErrant's Prowess in overcoming them is all that is requir'd to constitute the  Hero  in such Pieces And what principally distinguishes the Character of the  Heroine  is when she is taught to consider her Father's House as an inchanted Castle and her Lover as the Hero who is to dissolve the Charm and to set her at Liberty from one Confinement in order to put her into another and too probably a worse To instruct her how to climb Walls drop from Windows leap Precipices and do twenty other extravagant Things in order to shew the mad Strength of a Passion she ought to be asham'd of To make Parents and Guardians pass for Tyrants and the Voice of Reason to be drown'd in that of indiscreet Love which exalts the other Sex and debases her own And what is the Instruction that can be gather'd from such Pieces for the Conduct of common Life  Then have I been ready to quarrel with these Writers for another Reason and that is The dangerous Notion which they hardly ever fail to propagate of a  Firstsight Love  For there is such a Susceptibility supposed on both Sides which however it may pass in a Man very little becomes a Lady's Delicacy that they are smitten with a Glance the  fictitious  blind God is made a  real  Divinity and too often Prudence and Discretion are the first Offerings at his Shrine  I believe Madam said Miss  Stapylton  blushing and playing with her Fan there have been many  Instances of Peoples Loving at first Sight which have ended very happily  No doubt of it Miss reply'd I But there are three Chances to one that so precipitate a Liking does not For where can be the Room for Caution for Inquiry for the Display of Merit and Sincerity and even the Assurance of a  grateful Return  to a Lady who thus suffers herself to be prepossess'd Is it not a Random Shot Is it not a Proof of Weakness Is it not giving up the Negative Voice which belongs to the Sex even while she doubts to meet the Affirmative one from him she wishes for  Indeed Ladies continued I I cannot help concluding and I am the less afraid of speaking my Mind because of the Opinion I have of the Prudence of every Lady that hears me that where this Weakness is found it is no way favourable to a Lady's Character and to that Discretion which ought to distinguish it It looks to me as if a Lady's  Heart  were too much in the Power of her  Eye  and that she had permitted her  Fancy  to be much more busy than her  Judgment    Miss  Stapylton  blush'd and look'd around her  But I have generally observ'd Mrs  B  said Lady  Towers  that whenever you censure any Indiscretion you seldom fail to give Cautions how to avoid it And pray let us know what is to be done in this Case That is to say How a young Lady ought to guard against and overcome the first favourable Impressions  What I imagine reply'd I a young Lady ought to do on any the  least  favourable Impressions of this kind is immediately to  withdraw into herself  as one may say to reflect upon what she owes to her Parents to her Family to her Character and to her Sex and to resolve to check such a random Prepossession  which may much more probably as I hinted make her a Prey to the Undeserving than otherwise as there are so many of that Character to one Man of real Merit  The most that I apprehend a  Firstsight  Favour can do is to inspire a  Liking  and a Liking is conquerable if the Person will not brood over it till she hatches it into  Love  Then every Man and Woman has a black and a white Side and it is easy to set the Imperfections of the Person against the supposed Perfections while it is only  Liking  But if the busy Fancy be permitted to work as it pleases uncheck'd uncontroul'd then 'tis very likely were it but to keep itself in Countenance for her first Impressions she will see Perfections in the Object which no living Soul can see but herself And it will hardly be expected but that as a Consequence of her first Indiscretion she will confirm as an Act of her Judgment what her wild and ungovern'd Fancy had misled her to think of with so much partial Favour And too late as it may too probably happen she wilt see and lament her fatal and perhaps undutiful Error  We are talking of the Ladies only added I for I saw Miss  Stapylton  was become very grave But I believe the Case of Firstsight Love often operates alike in both Sexes and the same Inconveniencies may arise to both from a Rashness of this kind And where it is so it will be very lucky shall I say if either Gentleman or Lady find Reason on cool Reflection to approve a Choice which they were so ready to make without Thought  'Tis allow'd my dear Mrs  B  said Lady  Towers  that rash and precipitate Love may operate pretty much alike in the Rash and Precipitate of both Sexes and whichsoever loves generally exalts the Person beloved above his or her Merits But I am  desirous for the sake of us Maiden Ladies since 'tis a Science in which you are so great an Adept to have your Advice how we should watch and guard against its first Incroachments and that you will tell us what you apprehend gives the Men most Advantage over us  Nay now Lady  Towers  you railly my Presumption indeed  I admire you Madam reply'd she and every thing you say and do and I won't forgive you to call what I so seriously  say  and  think  Raillery For my own Part continued she I never was in Love yet nor I believe were any of these young Ladies Miss  Cope  looked a little silly upon this And who can better instruct us to guard  our  Hearts than a Lady who has so well defended  her own  Why then Madam if I must speak I think what gives the other Sex the greatest Advantage over even many of the most Deserving of ours is that dangerous Foible The  Love of Praise  and the Desire to be  flatter'd  and  admir'd  A Passion that I have observ'd to predominate more or less from Sixteen to Sixty in most of our Sex We are too generally delighted with the Company of those who extol our Graces of Person or Mind for will not a  grateful  Lady study hard to return a  few  Compliments to a Gentleman who makes her  so many  She is concern'd to  prove  him a Man of distinguishing Sense or a polite Man at least in regard to what she  thinks  of herself and so the Flatterer shall be preferr'd to such of the Sincere and Worthy as cannot say what they do not think And by this means many an excellent Lady has fallen a Prey to some sordid Designer  Then I think nothing gives Gentlemen so much Advantage over our Sex as to see how readily a virtuous Lady can forgive the capital Faults of the  most abandon'd of the other and that sad sad Notion  That a Reform'd Rake makes the best Husband  a Notion that has done more Hurt and Discredit too to our Sex as it has given more Encouragement to the Profligates of the other and more Discouragement to the sober Gentlemen than can be easily imagin'd A fine thing indeed as if the Wretch who had run thro' a Course of Iniquity to the endangering of Soul and Body was to be deem'd the best Companion for Life to an innocent and virtuous young Lady who is to owe the Kindness of his Treatment of her to his having never before accompany'd with a modest Woman nor till his Interest on one hand to which his Extravagance perhaps compels him to attend and his impair'd Constitution on the other oblige him him to it  wish'd  to accompany with one and who always made a Jest of the marry'd State and perhaps of every thing sacred and just  You observe very well my dear Mrs  B  said Lady  Towers  but People will be apt to think that you have less Reason than any of our Sex to be severe against the Notion you speak of For who was a greater Rake than a certain Gentleman and who a better Husband  Madam reply'd I the Gentleman you mean never was a common TownRake He is a Gentleman of Sense and fine Understanding and his Reformation  secondarily  as I may say has been the natural Effect of those extraordinary Qualities But besides Madam I will presume to say That that Gentleman as he has not many Equals in the Nobleness of his Nature so is not likely I doubt to have many Followers in a Reformation begun in the Bloom of Youth upon  Selfconviction  and altogether humanly speaking  spontaneous  Those young Ladies who would plead his Example in support  of this pernicious Notion should find out the same generous Qualities in the Gentleman before they trust to it and it will then do less Harm tho' even then I could not wish it to be generally propagated  It is really unaccountable said Lady  Towers  after all as Mrs  B  I remember once formerly said That our Sex should not as much insist upon Virtue and Sobriety in the Character of a Gentleman as the Gentleman be he ever such a Rake does in that of a Lady And 'tis certainly a great Encouragement to Libertinism that a wornout Debauchee shall think himself at any time good enough for an Husband and have the Confidence to imagine that a modest Lady will accept of his Address with a  Preference    I can account for it but one way said the Dean And that is that a modest Lady is apt to be  diffident  of herself and she thinks this Diffidence an Imperfection A Rake  never is  So he has in Perfection a Quality she thinks she wants and knowing  too little  of the World imagines she mends the Matter by accepting of one who knows  too much    That's well observ'd Mr Dean said Lady  Towers  But there is another Fault in our Sex which Mrs  B  has not touch'd upon and that is The foolish Pride some Ladies take in taming a wild Fellow and that they have been able to do more than many of their Sex before them could do A Pride that often costs them dear enough as I know in more than one Instance  Another Weakness said I might be produc'd against some of our Sex and that is in joining too readily to droll upon and sneer at the Misfortune of any poor young Creature who has shewn too little Regard for her Honour And that instead of speaking of it with Concern and thinking themselves  happy it was not their own Case and inveighing against the Seducer they will too lightly sport with the unhappy Creature's Fall propagate the Knowlege of it I would not look upon Miss  Sutton  while I spoke this and avoid her as an Infection yet after a while not scruple to admit into their Company the vile Aggressor and even smile with him at his barbarous Jests upon the poor Sufferer of their own Sex  I have known three or four Instances of this in my Time said Lady  Towers  that Miss  Sutton  might not take it to herself for she look'd down and was a little serious  This rejoin'd I puts me in mind of a little humourous Copy of Verses written as I believe by Mr  B  And which to the very Purpose we are speaking of he calls  Benefit of making others Misfortunes our own  Thou'st heard it or read it a Million of Times  That Men are made up of Falshoods and Crimes  Search all the old Authors and ransack the new  Thou'lt find in LoveStories scarce one Mortal true  Then why this complaining And why this wry Face  Is it 'cause thou'rt affected  most  with  thy own  Case  Hadst thou sooner made  OTHERS  Misfortunes thy own  Thou never  THYSELF  this Disaster hadst known  Thy  compassionate Caution  had kept thee from Evil  And thou mightst have defy'd Mankind and the Devil  The Ladies were pleas'd with the Lines but Lady  Towers  wanted to know she said at what Time of Mr  B  's Life they could be written Because added she I never suspected before that the good Gentleman ever took Pains to write Cautions or Exhortations  to our Sex to avoid the Delusions of his own  These Verses and this facetious but severe Remark of Lady  Towers  made every young Lady look up with a chearful Countenance because it pushed the Ball from  Self  And the Dean said to his Daughter So my Dear You that have been so attentive must let us know what useful Inferences you can draw from what Mrs  B  and the other Ladies have so excellently said  I observe Sir said Miss from the Faults the Ladies have so justly imputed to some of our Sex that the Advantage the Gentlemen  chiefly  have over us is from our own Weakness and that it behoves a prudent Lady to guard against  first Impressions  of Favour since she will think herself oblig'd in Compliment to  her own  Judgment to find Reasons if possible to confirm them  But I would be glad to know Ladies added Miss If there be any way that a Lady can judge whether a Gentleman means honourably or not in his Address to her  Mrs  B  can best inform you of that Miss  L  said Lady  Towers  What say you Mrs  B  There are a few Signs answer'd I easy to be known and I think almost infallible  Pray let's have 'em said Lady  Arthur  and they all were very attentive  These are they reply'd I I lay it down as an undoubted Truth That true Love is one of the most  respectful  Things in the World It strikes with Awe and Reverence the Mind of the Gentleman who boasts its Impression It is chaste and pure in Word and Deed and cannot bear to have the least Indecency mingle with it  If therefore a Gentleman be his Birth or Quality what it will the higher the worse presume to wound  a Lady's Ears with indecent Words If he endeavour in his Expressions or Sentiments to convey gross or impure Ideas to her Mind If he is continually pressing for  her Confidence  in  his  Honour If he requests Favours which a Lady ought to refuse If he can be regardless of his Conduct or Behaviour to her If he can use  boisterous  or  rude  Freedoms either to her  Person  or  Dress  Here poor Miss  Cope  by her Blushes bore Witness to her Case If he avoids  speaking  of  Marriage  when he has a  fair Opportunity  of doing it Here Miss  L  look'd down and blush'd or leaves it  once  to a Lady to wonder that he does not  In any or in all these Cases he is to be suspected and a Lady can have little Hope of such a Person nor as I humbly apprehend consistent with Honour and Discretion encourage his Address  The Ladies were so kind as to applaud all I said and so did the Dean Miss  Stapylton  and Miss  Cope  and Miss  L  were to try to recollect it when they came home and to write down what they could remember of the Conversation And our noble Guests coming in soon after with Mr  B  the Ladies would have departed but he prevailed upon them with some Difficulty to pass the Evening and Miss  L  who has an admirable Finger at the Spinnet as I have heretofore told you obliged us with two or three Tunes Each of the Ladies did the like and prevailed upon me to play a Tune or two But Miss  Cope  as well as Miss  L  surpass'd me much We all sung too in Turns and Mr  B  took the Violin in which he excels Lord  Davers  oblig'd us on the Harpsichord Mr  H  play'd on the Flute and sung us a Fop's Song and perform'd it in Character So that we had an exceeding gay Evening and parted with great Satisfaction on  all  Sides and high Delight on the young Ladies for this put them all  into good Humour and good Spirits enlivening the former Scene which otherwise might have closed perhaps more gravely than efficaciously  The Distance of Time since this Conversation passed enables me to add what I could not do when I wrote the Account of it which you have mislaid And which take briefly as follows  Miss  Stapylton  upon her Return home was as good as her Word and wrote down all she could recollect of the Conversation and suffered it to have such an Effect upon her as to turn the Course of her Reading and Studies to weightier and more solid Subjects and avoiding the Gentleman she had began to favour gave way to her Parents Recommendation and is happily marry'd to Sir  Jonathan Barnes    Miss  Cope  came to me a Week after this with the Leave of both her Parents and tarry'd with me Three Days in which time she open'd all her worthy Heart to me and return'd in such a Disposition and with such Resolutions that she never would see her Peer again nor receive Letters from him which she own'd to me she had done clandestinely before And she is now the happy Lady of Sir  Michael Beaumont  who makes her the best of Husbands and permits her to follow her charitable Inclinations according to a Scheme which she prevail'd upon me to give her  Miss  L  by the Dean's indulgent Prudence and Discretion has escaped her Rake and upon the Discovery of an Intrigue he was carrying on with another conceived a just Abhorrence of him and is since marry'd to Dr  Jenkins  as you know with whom she lives very happily  Miss  Sutton  is not quite so well off as the Three former tho' not altogether unhappy neither in her Way She could not indeed conquer her Love of  Dress and Tinsel and so became the Lady of Col  Wilson  And they are thus far easy in the Marriage State that being seldom together in all Probability they save a Multitude of Misunderstandings for the Colonel loves Gaming in which he is generally a Winner and so passes his Time mostly in Town His Lady has her Pleasures neither laudable nor criminal ones which she pursues in the Country And nowandthen a Letter passes on both Sides by the Inscription and Subscription of which they remind one another that they have been  once  in their Lives at  one  Church together  And what now my dear Lady  G  have I to add to this tedious Account for Letter I can hardly call it but that I am with great Affection  Your true Friend and Servant  P B  LETTER LXIV  My dear Lady  G  YOU desired me to send you a little Specimen of my  Nursery Tales  and  Stories  with which as Miss  Fenwick  told you on her Return to  Lincolnshire  I entertain my Miss  Goodwin  and my little Boys But you make me too high a Compliment when you tell me it is for your own Instruction and Example Yet you know my dear Lady  G  be your Motives what they will I must obey you altho' were others to see it I might expose myself to the Smiles and Contempt of Judges less prejudic'd in my Favour So I will begin without any further Apology and as near as I can give you  those very Stories with which Miss  Fenwick  was so pleased and of which she has made so favourable a Report  Let me acquaint you then that my Method is To give Characters of Persons I have known in one Part or other of my Life in feigned Names whose Conduct may serve for Imitation or Warning to my dear attentive Miss and sometimes I give Instances of good Boys and naughty Boys for the sake of my  Billy  and my  Davers  and they are continually coming about me Dear Madam a pretty Story now cries Miss And Dear Mamma tell me of good Boys and of naughty Boys cries  Billy    Miss is a surprising Child for her Age and is very familiar with many of the best Characters in the  Spectators  and having a Smattering of  Latin  and more than a Smattering of  Italian  and being a perfect Mistress of  French  is seldom at a Loss for the Derivation of even such Words as are not of  English  Original And so I shall give you a Story in feigned Names with which she is so delighted that she has wrote it down But I will first trespass on your Patience with one of my childish Tales  Every Day once or twice if I am not hinder'd I cause Miss  Goodwin  who plays and sings very prettily to give a Tune or two to me and my  Billy  and  Davers  who as well as my  Pamela  love and learn to touch the Keys young as the latter is and she will have a sweet Finger I can see that and a charming Ear and her Voice is Musick itselfOh the fond fond Mother I know you will say on reading this  Then Madam we all proceed hand in hand together to the Nursery to my  Charley  and  Jemmy  And in this happy Retirement so much my Delight in the Absence of my best Beloved imagine you see  me seated surrounded with the Joy and the Hope of my future Prospects as well as my present Comforts  Miss  Goodwin  imagine you see on my Right Hand sitting on a Velvet Stool because she is eldest and a Miss  Billy  on my Left in a little Cane Elbow Chair because he is eldest and a good Boy My  Davers  and my sparklingey'd  Pamela  with my  Charley  between them on little silken Cushions at my Feet hand in hand their pleased Eyes looking up to my more delighted ones and my sweetnatur'd promising  Jemmy  in my Lap the Nurses and the Cradle just behind us and the Nursery Maids delightedly pursuing some useful Needlework for the dear Charmers of my Heart All as hush and as still as Silence itself as the pretty Creatures generally are when their little watchful Eyes see my Lips beginning to open For they take great notice already of my Rule of Two Ears to  See this Vol p    One Tongue insomuch that if  Billy  or  Davers  are either of them for breaking the Mum as they call it they are immediately hush at any time if I put my Finger to my Lip or if Miss points hers to her Ears even to the breaking of a Word in two as it were And yet all my Boys are as lively as so many Birds while my  Pamela  is chearful easy soft gentle always smiling but modest and harmless as a Dove  I began with a Story of Two little Boys and Two little Girls the Children of a fine Gentleman and a fine Lady who loved them dearly That they were all so good and loved one another so well that every body who saw them admired them and talked of them far and near That they would part  with any thing to one another Loved the Poor Spoke kindly to the Servants Did every thing they were bid to do were not proud and knew no Strife but who should learn their Books best and be the prettiest Scholar That the Servants loved them and would do any thing they desired that they were not proud of fine Cloaths let not their Heads run upon their Playthings when they should mind their Books said Grace before they eat their Prayers before they went tobed and as soon as they rose were always clean and neat would not tell a Fib for the World and were above doing any thing that requir'd one That GOD blessed them more and more and blessed their Papa and Mamma and their Uncles and Aunts and Cousins for their sakes And there was a happy Family my dear LovesNo one idle all prettily imploy'd the Masters at their Books the Misses at their Books too or their Needles except at their Playhours when they were never rude nor noisy nor mischievous nor quarrelsome And no such Word was ever heard from their Mouths as Why mayn't I have this or that as well as  Billy  or  Bobby  Or Why should  Sally  have this or that any more than I But it was As my Mamma pleases My Mamma knows best and a Bow and a Smile and no Surliness or scouling Brow to be seen if they were deny'd any thing for well did they know that their Papa and Mamma loved them so dearly that they would refuse them nothing that was for their Good and they were sure when they were refused they asked for something that would have done them hurt had it been granted Never were such good Boys and Girls as these And they grew up and the Masters became fine Scholars and fine Gentlemen and every body honour'd them and  the Misses became fine Ladies and fine Housewives and this Gentleman when they grew to be Women sought to marry one of the Misses and that Gentleman the other and happy was he that could be admitted into their Companies So that they had nothing to do but pick and chuse the best Gentlemen in the County While the greatest Ladies for Birth and the most remarkable for Virtue which my Dears is better than either Birth or Fortune thought themselves honour'd by the Addresses of the Two Brothers And they marry'd and made good Papas and Mammas and were so many Blessings to the Age in which they lived There my dear Loves were happy Sons and Daughters For good Masters seldom fail to make good Gentlemen and good Misses good Ladies and GOD blesses them with as good Children as they were to their Parents and so the Blessing goes roundWho would not but be good  Well but Mamma we will all be good Won't we Master  Davers  cries my  Billy  Yes Brother  Billy  Then they kiss one another and if they have Playthings or any thing they like exchange with each other to shew the Effect my Lessons have upon them But what will become of the naughty Boys Tell us Mamma about the naughty Boys  Why there was a poor poor Widow Woman who had Three naughty Sons and One naughty Daughter and they would do nothing that their Mamma bid them do were always quarreling scratching and fighting would not say their Prayers would not learn their Book so that the little Boys used to laugh at them and point at them as they went along for Blockheads and nobody loved them or took notice of them except to beat and thump  them about for their naughty Ways and their Undutifulness to their poor Mother who worked hard to maintain them As they grew up they grew worse and worse and more and more stupid and ignorant so that they impoverish'd their poor Mother and at last broke her Heart poor poor Widow WomanAnd her Neighbours joined together to bury the poor Widow Woman for these sad ungracious Children made away with what little she had left while she was ill before her Heart was quite broken And this helped to break it the sooner for had she liv'd she saw she must have wanted Bread and had no Comfort from such wicked Children  Poor poor Widow Woman said my  Billy  with Tears and my little Dove shed Tears too and  Davers  was moved and Miss wiped her fine Eyes  But what became of the naughty Boys and the naughty Girl MammaBecame of them Why one Son was forced to go to Sea and there he was drowned Another turned Thief for he would not work and he came to an untimely End The third was idle and ignorant and nobody would imploy him that knew how he had used his poor Mother and so he was forced to go into a far Country and beg his Bread And the naughty Girl having never lov'd Work pined away in Sloth and Filthiness and at last broke her Arm and died of a Fever lamenting too late that she had been so wicked a Daughter to so good a MotherAnd so there was a sad End of all the Four ungracious Children who never would mind what their poor Mother said to them and GOD punished their Naughtiness as you seeWhile the good Children I mentioned before were the Ornament  and the Glory of their Family and the Delight of every body that knew them  Who would not be good was the Inference And the Repetition from  Billy  with his Hands clapt together Poor poor Widow Womangave me much Pleasure  So my childish Story ended with a Kiss of each pretty Dear and their Thanks for my Story And then came on Miss's Request for a  Woman  's Story as she called it I dismiss'd my Babies to their Playin the Apartment allotted for that purpose and taking Miss's Hand she standing before me all Attention began in a more womanly Strain to  her  for she is very fond of being thought a Woman and indeed is a prudent sensible Dear comprehends any thing instantly and makes very pretty Reflections upon what she hears or reads as you will observe in what follows  There is nothing my dear Miss  Goodwin  that young Ladies should be so watchful over as their Reputation 'Tis a tender Flower that the least Frost will nip the least cold Wind will blast and when once blasted it will never flourish again but wither to the very Root But this I have told you so often that I am sure I need not repeat what I have said So to my Story  There were Four pretty Ladies lived in one genteel Neighbourhood the Daughters of Four several Families but all Companions and Visitors and yet all of very different Inclinations COQUETILLA we will call one PRUDIANA another PROFUSIANA the third and PRUDENTIA the fourth their several Names denoting their respective Qualities  COQUETILLA a was the only Daughter of a worthy Baronet by a Lady very gay but rather indiscreet  than unvirtuous who took not due care of her Daughter's Education but let her be overrun with the Love of Fashions Dress and Equipage and when in  London  Balls Operas Plays the Park the Ring the WithdrawingRoom took up her whole Attention She admir'd nobody but herself flutter'd about laughing at and despising a Croud of MenFollowers whom she attracted by gay thoughtless Freedoms of Behaviour too nearly treading on the Skirts of Immodesty Yet made she not one worthy Conquest exciting on the contrary in all sober Minds that Contempt upon herself which she so profusely would be thought to pour down upon the rest of the World After she had several Years flutter'd about the dangerous Light like some silly Fly she at last sindged the Wings of her Reputation for being despised by every worthy Heart she became too easy and cheap a Prey to a Man the most unworthy of all her Followers who had Resolution and Confidence enough to break thro' those few cobweb Reserves in which she had incircled her precarious Virtue and which were no longer of Force to preserve her Honour than till she met with a Man more bold and more enterprising than herself and who was as designing as she was thoughtless And what then became of  Coquetilla  Why she was forced to pass over Sea to  Ireland  where nobody knew her and to bury herself in a dull Obscurity to go by another Name and at last unable to support a Life so unsuitable to the natural Gaiety of her Temper she pin'd herself into a Consumption and dy'd unpity'd and unlamented among Strangers and having not one Friend but whom she bought with her Money  Poor Lady  Coquetilla  said Miss what a sad thing it is to have a wrong Education And how  happy am I who have so good a Lady to supply the Place of a dear distant MammaBut be pleased Madam to proceed to the next  PRUDIANA my Dear was the Daughter of a Gentleman who was a Widower having while the young Lady was an Infant bury'd her Mamma He was a good sort of Man but had but one Lesson to teach to  Prudiana  and that was To avoid all manner of Conversation with the Men but never gave her the right Turn of Mind nor instilled into it that Sense of her religious Duties which would have been her best Guard in all Temptations For so as she kept out of the Sight and Conversation of the Gentlemen and avoided the Company of those Ladies who more freely conversed with the other Sex it was all her Papa desired of her This gave her a haughty sullen and reserved Turn made her stiff formal and affected She had Sense enough to discover early the Faults of  Coquetilla  and in Dislike of them fell the more easily into that contrary Extreme which her recluse Education and her Papa's Cautions naturally led her So that Pride Reserve Affectation and Censoriousness made up the Essentials of her Character and she became more unamiable even than  Coquetilla  and as the other was too accessible  Prudiana  was quite unapproachable by Gentlemen and unfit for any Conversation but that of her Servants being also deserted by those of her own Sex by whom she might have improv'd on account of her censorious Disposition And what was the Consequence Why this Every worthy Person of both Sexes despising her and she being used to see nobody but Servants at last throws herself upon one of that Class In an evil Hour she finds something that is taking to her low Taste in the Person of her Papa's Valet  a Wretch so infinitely beneath her but a Coxcomb of a Servant that every body attributed to her the Scandal of making the first Advances for otherwise it was presumed he durst not have looked up to his Master's Daughter So here ended all her Pride all her Reserves came to this Her Censoriousness of others redoubled People's Contempts upon herself and made nobody pity her She was finally turn'd out of Doors without a Peny of Fortune The Fellow was forced to set up a Barber's Shop in a Country Town for all he knew was to shave and dress a Peruque and her Papa would never look upon her more So that  Prudiana  became the Outcast of her Family and the Scorn of all that knew her and was forced to mingle in Conversation and Company with the Wretches of her Husband's Degree  Poor miserable  Prudiana  said MissWhat a sad sad Fall was hersAnd all owing to the want of a proper Education tooAnd to the Loss of such a Mamma as I have an Aunt and so wise a Papa as I have an UncleHow could her Papa I wonder restrain her Person as he did like a poor Nun and make her unacquainted with the generous Restraints of the Mind  I am sure my dear good Aunt it will be owing to you that I shall never be a  Coquetilla  nor a  Prudiana  neither Your Table is always surrounded with the best of Company with worthy Gentlemen as well as Ladies and you instruct me to judge of both and of every new Guest in such a manner as makes me esteem them all and censure nobody but yet to see Faults in some to avoid and Graces in others to imitate but in nobody but Yourself and my Uncle any thing so like Perfection as shall attract one's Admiration to one's own Ruin  You are young yet my Love and must always doubt your own Strength and pray to God more and more as your Years advance to give you more and more Prudence and Watchfulness over your Conduct  But yet my Dear you must think justly of yourself too for let the young Gentlemen be ever so learned and discreet your Education intitles you to think as well of yourself as of them For don't you see the Ladies who are so kind to visit us that have not been abroad as you have been when they were young yet make as good Figures in Conversation say as good things as any of the Gentlemen For my Dear all that the Gentlemen know more than the Ladies except here and there such an one as your dear Uncle with all their learned Education is only that they have been  disciplin'd  perhaps into an Observation of a few Accuracies in Speech that if they know no more rather distinguish the  Pedant  than the  Gentleman  Such as the avoiding of a false Concord▪ as they call it and which you know how to do as well as the best not to put a  was  for a  were  an  are  for an  is  and to be able to speak in Mood and Tense and such like valuable Parts of Education So that my Dear you can have no Reason to look upon that Sex in so high a Light as to depreciate your own And yet you must not be proud nor conceited neither but make this one Rule your Guide  In your  maiden State  think yourself  above  the Gentlemen and they'll think you so too and address you with Reverence and Respect if they see it is not arrogant Pride but a conscious Merit a true Dignity such as becomes Virgin Modesty and untainted Purity of Mind and Manners like that of an Angel among Men for so young Ladies  should look upon themselves to be and will then be treated as such by the other Sex  In your  marry'd State  which is a kind of State of Humiliation for a Lady you must think yourself subordinate to your Husband for so it has pleased GOD to make us You must have no Will of your own in  petty  Things And if you marry a Gentleman of Sense and Honour such an one as your Uncle he will look upon you as his Equal and will exalt you the more for your abasing yourselfIn short my Dear he will act by you just as your dear Uncle does by me And then what a happy Creature will you be  So I shall Madam To be sure I shallBut I know I shall be happy whenever I marry because I have such wise Directors and such an Example before me And if it please GOD I will never think of any Man in pursuance of your constant Advice to young Ladies at the Teatable who is not a Man of Sense and a virtuous Gentleman But now dear Madam for your next Character There are Two more yet to come that's my Pleasure I wish there were Ten  Why the next was PROFUSIANA you remember my dear Love  Profusiana  took another Course to  her  Ruin She fell into some of  Coquetilla  's Foibles but pursu'd them for another End and in another Manner Struck with the Grandeur and Magnificence of what weak People call the  Upper Life  she gives herself up to the Circus to Balls to Operas Masquerades and Assemblées affects to shine at the Head of all Company at  Tunbridge  at  Bath  and every Place of publick Resort plays high is always receiving and paying Visits giving Balls and making Treats and Entertainments and is so much  above  the Conduct which  mostly recommends a young Lady to the Esteem of the Deserving of the other Sex that no Gentleman who prefers solid Happiness can think of addressing her tho' she is a fine Person and has many outward Graces of Behaviour She becomes the favourite Toast of the Places she frequents is proud of that Distinction gives the Fashion and delights in the Pride that she can make Apes by Imitation whenever she pleases But yet endeavouring to avoid being thought proud makes herself cheap and is the Subject of the Attempts of every Coxcomb of Eminence and with much ado preserves her Virtue tho' hardly her Character  What all this while is poor  Profusiana  doing She would be glad perhaps of a suitable Proposal and would it may be give up some of her Gaieties and Extravagancies for  Profusiana  has Wit and is not totally abandon'd of Reflection when she suffers herself to think But her Conduct procures her not one solid Friendship and she has not in a Twelvemonth among a thousand Professions of Service one Devoir that she can attend to or a Friend that she can depend upon All the Women she sees if she excels them hate her the gay Part of the Men with whom she accompanies most are all in a Plot against her Honour Even the Gentlemen whose Conduct in the general is govern'd by Principles of Virtue come down to these publick Places to partake of the innocent Freedoms allowed there and oftentimes give themselves Airs of Gallantry and never have it in their Thoughts to commence a Treaty of Marriage with an Acquaintance begun upon that gay Spot What solid Friendships and Satisfactions then is  Profusiana  excluded from  Her Name indeed is written in every publick Window and prostituted as I may call it at the  Pleasure of every Profligate or Sot who carries a Diamond to ingrave it And that it may be with most vile and barbarous Imputations and Freedoms of Words added by Rakes who very probably never exchang'd a Syllable with her The wounded Trees are perhaps taught also to wear the Initials of her Name linked not unlikely and widening as they grow with those of a Scoundrel But all this while she makes not the least Impression upon one noble Heart And at last perhaps having run on to the End of an uninterrupted Race of Follies she is cheated into the Arms of some vile Fortunehunter who quickly lavishes away the Remains of that Fortune which her Extravagance had left and then after the worst Usage abandoning her with Contempt she sinks into an Obscurity that cuts short the Thread of her Life and leaves no Remembrance but on the brittle Glass and more faithful Bark that ever she had a Being  Alas alas what a Butterfly of a Day said Missan Expression she remembered of Lady  Towers  'swas poor  Profusiana  What a sad thing to be so dazled by worldly Grandeur and to have so many Admirers and not one real Friend  Very true my Dear and how carefully ought a Person of a gay and lively Temper to watch over it And what a Rock may publick Places be to a Lady's Reputation if she be not doubly vigilant in her Conduct when she is exposed to the Censures and Observations of malignant Crouds of People many of the worst of whom spare the least those who are most unlike themselves  But then Madam said Miss would  Profusiana  venture to play at publick Places Will Ladies game Madam I have heard you say that Lords and Sharpers but just out of Liveries in Gaming are  upon a Foot in every thing save that one has nothing to lose and the other much besides his Reputation And will Ladies so disgrace their Characters and their Sex as to pursue this pernicious Diversion in publick  Yes my Dear they will too often the more's the Pity And don't you remember when we were at  Bath  how I hurried you by some Knots of genteel People and you asked What those were doing I told you whisperingly They were Gameing and loth I was that my Miss  Goodwin  should stop to see some Sights to which till she arrived at Years of Discretion it was not proper to familiarize her Eye in some sort acting like the antient  Romans  who would not assign Punishments to certain atrocious Crimes because they were such Friends to human Nature as to suppose it incapable of committing them So I was not for having you while a little Girl see those things which I thought when you grew older should be new and shocking to you But now you are so much a Woman in Discretion that I may tell you any thing  She kiss'd my Hand and made me a fine CourtesyAnd told me That now she long'd to hear of  Prudentia  's Conduct  Her  Name Madam said she promises better things than those of her Three Companions and so it had need For how sad is it to think that out of Four Ladies of Distinction Three of them should be naughty and  of course  unhappyThese two Words  of course  my Dear said I were very prettily put in Let me kiss you for them Since every one that is naughty first or last must be  certainly  unhappy  Far otherwise than what I have related was it with the amiable PRUDENTIA Like the industrious Bee she makes up her Honeyhoard from every  Flower bitter as well as sweet for every Character is of Use to her by which she can improve her own She had the Happiness of an Aunt who loved her as I do you and of an Uncle who doted on her as yours does For alas poor  Prudentia  lost her Papa and Mamma almost in her Infancy in one Week But was so happy in her Uncle and Aunt's Care as not to miss them in her Education and but just to remember their Persons By Reading by Observation and by Attention she daily added new Advantages to those which her Education gave her She saw and pitied the fluttering Freedoms and dangerous Flights of COQUETILLA The sullen Pride the Affectation and stiff Reserves which PRUDIANA assumed she penetrated and made it her Study to avoid And the gay hazardous Conduct extravagant Temper and Love of tinsell'd Grandeur which were the Blemishes of PROFUSIANA's Character she dreaded and shunn'd She fortifies herself with the excellent Examples of the past and present Ages and knows how to avoid the Faults of the Faulty and to imitate the Graces of the most perfect She takes into her Scheme of that future Happiness which she hopes to make her own what are the  true  Excellencies of her Sex and endeavours to appropriate to herself the domestick Virtues which shall one Day make her the Crown of some worthy Gentleman's earthly Happiness and which  of course  as you prettily said my Dear will secure and heighten her own  That noble Frankness of Disposition that sweet and unaffected Openness and Simplicity all unconscious of Art or Design in herself and undreading it from others but yet her Prudence ever wakeful and on its Guard which shine in all her Actions and Behaviour commend her to the Esteem and  Reverence of all Mankind as her Humility and Affability and a Temper uncensorious and ever making the best for the absent Person of either Sex do to the Love of every Lady Her Name indeed is not prostituted on Windows nor carved on the Barks of Trees in publick Places and Walks But it smells sweet to every delighted Nostril dwells on every praiseful Tongue and is ingraved on every admiring Heart She meets with no Address but from Men of Honour and Probity The fluttering Coxcomb the inveigling Parasite the insidious Deceiver the mercenary Fortunehunter spread no Snares for a Heart guarded by Discretion and Prudence as hers is They see that all her amiable Virtues are the happy Result of an uniform Judgment and the Effects of her own Wisdom founded in an Education to which she does the highest Credit And at last after several worthy Offers enough to perplex any Lady's Choice she blesses some one happy Gentleman more distinguish'd than the rest for Learning good Sense and  true Politeness  which is but another Word for  Virtue  and  Honour  and shines to her last comfortable Hour in all the Duties of domestick Life as an excellent Wife Mother Mistress Friend and Christian and so confirms all the Expectations of which her Maiden Life had given such strong and such edifying Presages  Then folding my dear Miss in my Arms and kissing her Tears of Pleasure standing in her pretty Eyes Who would not said I shun the Examples of the COQUETILLA's the PRUDIANA's and the PROFUSIANA's of this World and chuse to imitate the Character of PRUDENTIAthe Happy and the Happymaking PRUDENTIA  O Madam Madam said the dear Creature smothering me with her even clamorous Kisses PRUDENTIA is YOUIs YOU indeedIt  can  be nobody elseO teach me good GOD to follow  your  Example and I shall be a SECOND PRUDENTIAIndeed I shall  GOD send you may my beloved Miss And may he bless you more if possible than  Prudentia  was blessed  And so my dear Lady  G  you have some of my Nursery Tales with which relying on your kind Allowance and Friendship I conclude myself  Your affectionate and faithful  P B  CONCLUSION  ALtho' it will be seen and confess'd notwithstanding the Sheets which compose these Two additional Volumes might have been easily formed into Three how difficult it was to reduce Materials so ample within the Compass which the Editor had assigned them yet being unwilling to deserve a Suspicion that the Extent of this Work was to be measur'd but by the Patience of its Readers He thinks proper to conclude in this Place Subjoining in order to elucidate the Whole a brief Note of the following Facts  That Mr  B  continued after the Affair that took Date at the Masquerade and so happily concluded to be one of the best and most exemplary of Men an Honour to his Country both in his publick and private Capacity having at the Instances of some of his Friends in very elevated Stations accepted of an honourable Imployment abroad in the Service of the State which he discharged in such a manner as might be expected from his Qualifications and Knowlege of the World And on his Return after an Absence of Three Years resisting all the Temptations of Ambition devoted himself to his privater Duties and join'd with his excellent Lady in every pious Wish of her Heart Adorning the married Life with all the Warmth of an elegant Tenderness Beloved by his Tenants respected by his Neighbours rever'd by his Children and almost ador'd by the Poor in every County where his Estates gave him Interest as well for his own bountiful Temper as for the Charities which he permitted  to be dispensed with so liberal a Hand by the Representative of his Heart his dear Lady  That she made him the Father of Seven fine Children Five Sons and Two Daughters all adorn'd and accomplish'd by Nature to be the Joy and Delight of such Parents being educated in every respect by the Rules of their inimitable Mother in that Book which she mentions to have written for the Revisal and Correction of her Consort the Contents of which may be gather'd from her Remarks upon Mr  Locke  's Treatise of Education in her Letters to Mr  B  and in those to Lady  G  That Miss GOODWIN at the Age of Eighteen was marry'd to a young Gentleman of fine Parts and great Sobriety and Virtue And that both she and her Spouse in every material Part of their Conduct and in their Behaviour to one another emulated the great and good Examples set them by Mr and Mrs  B  That Lord DAVERS dying Two Years before this Marriage his Lady went to reside at the Hall in  Lincolnshire  the Place of her Birth that she might enjoy the Company and Conversation of her excellent Sister who for Conveniency of the Chapel and Advantage of Room and Situation had prevail'd upon Mr  B  to make that the chief Place of his Residence and there the noble Lady lived long in the strictest Friendship with the happy Pair a resolv'd and an honourable Relict of her affectionate Lord  That the worthy Mr ANDREWS and the happy good Woman his Wife lived together in the calm conscious Sweetness set forth in their Letters for the Space of Twelve Years at the  Kentish  Farm where the good old Gentlewoman then died first full of Comfort and Years her dutiful  Daughter performing the last pious Offices to so beloved and so loving a Parent Her Husband surviving her about a Year only  That Lady  G  Miss DARNFORD that was after a happy Marriage of several Years died in Childbed of her Fourth Child to the inexpressible Concern of her affectionate Consort and of her dear Friend Mrs  B  That Mr LONGMAN liv'd to a great Age in the worthy Family much esteemed by every one having trained up a diligent Youth whom he had recommended to ease him in his Business and who answering Expectation succeeded him in it  That at last dying rich out of his great Love and Gratitude to the honourable Family in whose Service he had acquir'd most of his Fortune and in Disgust to his nearest Relations who had perversely disoblig'd him he bequeath'd to Three of them One hundred Pounds apiece and left all the rest to his honoured Principal Mr  B  Who as soon as he came to know it being at that Time abroad directed his Lady to call together the Relations of the old Gentleman and after touching them to the Heart with a just and effectual Reproof when she found them fill'd with due Sense of their Demerit which had been the Cause of their suffering then to divide the Whole which had been lest him among them according to their Proximity of Blood An Action worthy of so generous and ennobled a Spirit and which procured him the Prayers and Blessings not only of the Benefited but of all who heard of it For it is easy to imagine how chearfully and how gracefully his benevolent Lady discharged a Command so well suited to her natural Generosity  ADVERTISEMENT  THERE being Reason to apprehend from the former Attempts of some Imitators who supposing the Story of PAMELA a Fiction have murder'd that excellent Lady and mistaken and misrepresented other suppos'd imaginary CHARACTERS that Persons may not be wanting who will impose new Continuations upon the Publick  It is with a View to some Designs of this Nature that the Editor who is sorry to find himself under a Necessity of declaring disagreeable Truths and who both hates and would avoid all Occasion of Offence or Reflection gives this publick Assistance by way of Prevention That all the Copies of Mrs  B  's Observations and Writings upon
