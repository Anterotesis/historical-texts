 FUN A Paroditragicomical SATIRE  As it was to have been perform'd at the  CastleTavern PaternosterRow  ON THURSDAY FEBRUARY BUT  Suppressed  BY A Special ORDER from the LORDMAYOR and COURT of ALDERMEN  LONDON  Sold by F STAMPER in  Pope'shead Alley Cornhill and by all other Booksellers  MDCCLII  Price One Shilling  ADVERTISEMENT  THE Publication of this Piece would not have been so long delay'd but for the Expectation of performing it as at first intended which however by the same indefatigable Opposition was still frustrated  PREFACE  _THE Father of the following little Offspring being very well convinc'd of the natural Weakness of this his puny Child did never intend to trust it abroad without the  LEADING STRINGS  of  Action  had not the Fear of those who like Cowards are afraid of their own Shadows assiduously oppos'd the Representation being terribly apprehensive that the Strength of a poor Baby  Monosyllable  might affect the Magnanimity of a  Drawcansir  Such is the Force of SelfConvictionBut as this Infant is oblig'd to walk alone by many who are resolv'd on it's Appearance it's Father most humbly desires the goodnatur'd Town will not tumble the little Creature into the Dirt but that they will help it forward over the Kennels of Detraction and in Compassion to the Tenderness of it's Age keep the barking Curs the Critics at a Distance And to excite them to this Benevolence here  follow the Memoirs of the cruel and affecting Period of its Birth c  This Piece of  Fun  Son to the Father and Grandson to the Grandfather of the same Name was conceiv'd in a Fit of Laughter about the th of  February  in the Year His Mother advanc'd happily in her Pregnancy and there were great Hopes of a fine Offspring but unhappily just before the Time of her Delivery Measures were taken by a certain great Man to make her miscarry excited as some say to this Piece of Barbarity by an old Woman's Prophesy which he keeps by him cast in  leaden  Characters in a Chest of  Brass  secured like the  fortunate Tickets  of a Lottery by  seven Locks  And of which Prophesy the following is a Transcript  When  Fun  Has a Son  Then  Drawcansir  's Race is run  However childish and ridiculous it may seem for a Man to be affected with such idle Stuff as this it is not unprecedented or extravagantly strange since Tradition tells us that  Saturn  Father of  JUPITER  the Great Grandfather of  Cyrus  and many other august Personages were equally mov'd by such Instigations to much the same Absurdities  Notwithstanding however all such malignant Measures were taken the full Time of Pregnancy advanc'd and the Child was hourly expected when a  positive Order  came down that  Mrs FUN  who then lay at the  CastleTavern PaternosterRow  must not be brought tobed within the Walls lest the Child which was suspected to be a Bastard should bring a Scandal on the  Dignity  and  Chastity  of the City Upon this even while the Lady lay crying out the Father waited on the chief Personage of the  Liberties  with Remonstrances that the Child was very honestly got and that none but very creditable People were at the Labour complaining at the same Time that the same Privilege had been permitted an  old Woman  of  a very bad Character  one  Mother Midnight  who had often practis'd her Profession there tho' it was now denied others 'Twas all in vain The Gentleman though he behav'd with a great deal of Politeness and Goodmanners was so prepossess'd against the whole Family of  FUN  which had been falsely represented to him as of no Character or Reputation that he not only forbid the Men Midwives doing their Duty but sent others to see his Orders duly executedWhat could now be done  Mrs FUN  was in the midst of her Travail remov'd and nobody daring to give her Assistance her poor Offspring almost perished in the Birth But  Nature had been liberal the  Stamina  were sound and branched out for Life 'Tis true indeed its Features were so defac'd that the strong  Likeness  in them was almost lost and a Weakness which will be lasting as it's Life is the Consequence of the Usage it then met withIf after all then it should fail of answering those Expectations the Town had of it in Embrio it will undoubtedly be thought there is Reason enough to excuse all the Imperfections and Failings it is unhappily afflicted with since these are so far from being its Faults that they are Misfortunes which must infallibly engage the Protection of every candid tenderhearted  christian  Reader  PROLOGUE  AS dying Sinners hope to get to Heav'n  And beg and pray to have their Crimes forgiv'n  So I come here with humble Supplication  In Hopes you'll kindly save us from  Damnation  For you must know the whole of this  Design  The Plot the Manner Sentiment is mine  'Tis true we must confess our motley Piece  Is not confin'd by Laws from  Rome  or  Greece  For I disdain old  Aristotle  's Rules  That tie down Scriblers limit none but  Fools  I dare beyond the Goal of Critics run  What Order should confine the Works of  FUN  Whose  Self  I amAnd for your Information  Hear my Birth Parentage and Education  My Sire was thirty Years

RIBALDRY  her favourite Gallant  Now little Delicacy dwelt in either  For as I'm told they  all Three  lay together  Soon after I was born their darling Son  A Bastard Compound hewas christen'd  FUN  Laughter  a merry Jade was chose my Nurse  Whose  Birth  was mean but Education worse  Betimes she taught me to distort the Face  And sneer at ev'ry Thing but want of Grace  At twelve Years old she sent me first to School  My Tutor  Ignorance  a Coxcomb and a Fool  Little I learn'd 'tis true but ev'ry Day  The Truant play'd at length ran quite away  Proud of my Freedom rambling up and down  Folly  a Jilt that ruins half the Town  Spreading those Arms which ev'ry Fool admires  Caught me to satisfy her loose Desires  The Task tho' hard I follow'd with Delight  Sometimes most wisely wrong and sometimes blindly right  Above all Order or the vain Pretence  Of Learning Genius Taste or Common Sense  Who then will censure what may here be done  What  WIT  will criticise a  PIECE OF FUN

will find an ExcuseAnd I hope also the Error his Lordship might possibly unknowingly and I am confident unwillingly committed is not of such a Nature in itself as to make either of you slight a Reconciliation As nothing is more conducive to the Promotion of  Justice  and the  Good  of  Community  than the perfect Amity of People of  Power  and  Fortune  and which it is necessary they should preserve in order that the  lower  Part of Mankind should meet with the Punishment due to their Offencesif you will do me the Honour with his Lordship to step into the next Room a Moment I will
