I Of Caterpillars in General  IF we take a cursory view of insects in ge∣neral caterpillars alone and the butterflies and moths they give birth to will make a third part of the number Wherever we move wherever we turn these insects in one shape or another present themselves to our view Some in every state offer the most entertain∣ing spectacle others are beautiful only in their winged form Many persons of which number I am one have an invincible aversion to caterpillars and worms of every species there is something disagreeable in their slow crawling motion for which the variety of their colouring can never compensate But others feel no repugnance at observing and even handling them with the most attentive application  There is nothing in the butterfly state so beau∣tiful or splendid as these insects They serve not less than the birds themselves to banish so∣litude from our walks and to fill up our idle in∣tervals with the most pleasing speculations The butterfly makes one of the principal ornaments of oriental poetry but in those countries the insect is larger and more beautiful than with us  The beauties of the fly may therefore very well excite our curiosity to examine the reptile But we are still more strongly attached to this tribe from the usefulness of one of the number The silkworm is perhaps the most serviceable of all other animals since from its labours and the manufacture attending it near a third part of the world are cloathed adorned and supported  Caterpillars may be easily distinguished from worms or maggots by the number of their feet and by their producing butterflies of moths When the sun calls up vegetation and vivifies the various eggs of insects the caterpillars are the first that are seen upon almost every vegetable and tree eating its leaves and preparing for a state of greater perfection They have feet both before and behind which not only enable them to move forward by a sort of steps made by their fore and hinder parts but also to climb up ve∣getables and to stretch themselves out from the boughs and stalks to reach their food at a  distance All of this class have from eight feet at the least to sixteen and this may serve to distinguish them from the worm tribe that never have so many The animal into which they are converted is always a butterfly or a moth and these are always distinguished from other flies by having their wings covered over with a painted dust which gives them such various beauty The wings of flies are trans∣parent as we see in the common flesh fly while those of beetles are hard like horn from such the wing of a butterfly may be easily distin∣guished and words would obscure their dif∣ferences  From hence it appears that caterpillars whether in the reptile state or advanced to their last state of perfection into butterflies may easily be distinguished from all other insects being animals peculiarly formed and also of a pe∣culiar nature The transmutations they undergo are also more numerous than those of any insect hitherto mentioned and in consequence they have been placed in the third order of changes by Swammerdam who has thrown such lights upon this part of natural history In the second order of changes mentioned before we saw the grass∣hopper and the earwig when excluded from the egg assume a form very like that which they  were after to preserve and seemed arrived at a state of perfection in all respects except in not having wings which did not bud forth until they were come to maturity But the in∣sects of this third order that we are now about to describe go through a much greater variety of transformations for when they are excluded from the egg they assume the form of a small caterpillar which feeds and grows larger every day often changing its skin but still preserving its form When the animal has come to a cer∣tain magnitude in this state it discontinues eat∣ing makes itself a covering or husk in which it remains wrapped up seemingly without life or motion and after having for some time con∣tinued in this state it once more bursts its con∣finement and comes forth a beautiful butterfly Thus we see this animal put on no less than three different appearances from the time it is first excluded from the egg It appears a crawling caterpillar then an insensible aurelia as it is called without life or motion and lastly a butterfly variously painted according to its different kind Having thus distinguished this class of insects from all others we will first sur∣vey their history in general and then enter par∣ticularly into the manners and nature of a few of them which most deserve our curiosity and attention  CHAP II Of the Transformations of the Caterpillar into its corresponding Butterfly or Moth  WHEN winter has disrobed the trees of their leaves Nature then seems to have lost her in∣sects There are thousands of different kinds with and without wings which though swarming at other seasons then entirely disappear Our fields are repeopled when the leaves begin to bud by the genial influence of spring and ca∣terpillars of various sorts are seen feeding upon the promise of the year even before the leaves are completely unfolded Those caterpillars which we then see may serve to give us a view of the general means which Nature employs to preserve such a number of insects during that season when they can no longer find subsistence It is known by united experience that all these animals are hatched from the eggs of butterflies and those who observe them more closely will find the fly very careful in depositing its eggs in those places where they are likely to be hatched with the greatest safety and success During winter therefore the greatest number of ca∣terpillars are in an egg state and in this lifeless  situation brave all the rigours and the humi∣dity of the climate and though often exposed to all its changes still preserve the latent prin∣ciples of life which is more fully exerted at the approach of spring That same power that pushes forth the budding leaf and the opening flower impels the insect into animation and Nature at once seems to furnish the guest and the banquet When the insect has found force to break its shell it always finds its favourite aliments provided in abundance before it  But all caterpillars are not sent off from the egg in the beginning of spring for many of them have subsisted during the winter in their au∣relia state in which as we have briefly observed above the animal is seemingly deprived of life and motion In this state of insensibility many of these insects continue during the rigours of winter some enclosed in a kind of shell which they have spun for themselves at the end of autumn some concealed under the bark of trees others in the chinks of old walls and many buried under ground From all these a variety of butterflies are seen to issue in the beginning of spring and adorn the earliest part of the year with their painted flutterings  Some caterpillars do not make any change whatsoever at the approach of winter but con∣tinue  to live in their reptile state through all the severity of the season These chuse them∣selves some retreat where they may remain un∣disturbed for some months together and there they remain quite motionless and as insensible as if they were actually dead Their constitution is such that food at that time would be use∣less and the cold prevents their making those dissipations which require restoration In ge∣neral caterpillars of this kind are found in great numbers together enclosed in one common web that covers them all and serves to protect them from the injuries of the air  Lastly there are some of the caterpillar kind whose butterflies live all the winter and who having fluttered about for some part of the latter end of autumn seek for some retreat during the winter in order to answer the ends of pro∣pagation at the approach of spring These are often found lifeless and motionless in the hol∣lows of trees or the clefts of timber but by being approached to the fire they recover life and activity and seem to anticipate the desires of the spring  In general however whether the animal has subsisted in an egg state during the winter or whether as a butterfly bred from an aurelia in the beginning of spring or a butterfly that  has subsisted during the winter and lays eggs as soon as the leaves of plants are shot forward the whole swarm of caterpillars are in motion to snare the banquet that Nature has provided There is scarce a plant that has not its own pe∣culiar insects and some are known to support several of different kinds Of these many are hatched from the egg at the foot of the tree and climb up to its leaves for subsistence the eggs of others have been glued by the parent butterfly to the leaves and they are no sooner excluded from the shell but they find them∣selves in the midst of plenty  When the caterpillar first bursts from the egg it is small and feeble its appetites are in pro∣portion to its size and it seems to make no great consumption but as it encreases in magnitude it improves in its appetites so that in its adult caterpillar state it is the most ravenous of all animals whatsoever A single caterpillar will eat double its own weight of leaves in a day and yet seems no way disordered by the mealWhat would mankind do if their oxen or their horses were so voracious  These voracious habits with its slow crawling motion but still more a stinging like that of nettles which follows upon handling the greatest number of them make these insects not the most  agreeable objects of human curiosity However there are many philosophers who have spent years in their contemplation and who have not only attended to their habits and labours but mi∣nutely examined their structure and internal conformation  The body of the caterpillar when anato∣mically considered is found composed of rings whose circumference is pretty near circular or oval They are generally twelve in number and are all membraneous by which caterpillars may be distinguished from many other insects that nearly resemble them in form The head of the caterpillar is connected to the first ring by the neck that is generally so short and con∣tracted that it is scarce visible All the co∣vering of the head in caterpillars seems to consist of a shell and they have neither upper nor un∣der jaw for they are both placed rather verti∣cally and each jaw armed with a large thick tooth which is singly equal to numbers With these the animals devour their food in such amazing quantities and with these some of the kind defend themselves against their ene∣mies Though the mouth be kept shut the teeth are always uncovered and while the insect is in health they are seldom without employ∣ment Whatever the caterpillar devours these  teeth serve to chop it into small pieces and render the parts of the leaf fit for swallowing Many kinds while they are yet young eat only the succulent part of the leaf and leave all the fibres untouched others however attack the whole leaf and eat it clean away One may be amused for a little time in observing the avidity with which they are seen to feed some are seen eating the whole day others have their hours of repast some chuse the night and others the day When the caterpillar attacks a leaf it places its body in such a manner that the edge of the leaf shall fall between its feet which keeps it steady while the teeth are em∣ployed in cutting it these fall upon the leaf somewhat in the manner of a pair of gardener's sheers and every morsel is swallowed as soon as cut Some caterpillars feed upon leaves so very narrow that they are not broader than their mouths in this case the animal is seen to devour it from the point as we would eat a radish  As there are various kinds of caterpillars the numbers of their feet are various some having eight and some sixteen Of these feet the six foremost are covered with a sort of shining gristle and are therefore called the shelly legs The hindmost feet whatever be  their number are soft and flexible and are called membranaceous Caterpillars also with regard to their external figure are either smooth or hairy The skin of the first kind is soft to the touch or hard like shagreen the skin of the latter is hairy and as it were thorny and generally if handled stings like nettles Some of them even cause this stinging pain if but approached too nearly  Caterpillars in general have six small black spots placed on the circumference of the fore ring and a little to the side of the head Three of these are larger than the rest and are convex and transparent these Reaumur takes to be the eyes of the caterpillar however most of these reptiles have very little occasion for sight and seem only to be directed by their feeling  But the parts of the caterpillar's body which most justly demand our attention are the stigmata as they are called or those holes on the sides of its body through which the animal is supposed to breathe All along this insect's body on each side these holes are easily dis∣coverable They are eighteen in number nine on a side rather nearer the belly than the back a hole for every ring of which the animal's body is composed except the second the third and the last These oval openings may be con∣sidered  as so many mouths through which the insect breathes but with this difference that as we have but one pair of lungs the caterpillar has no less than eighteen It requires no great anatomical dexterity to discover these lungs in the larger kind of caterpillars they appear at first view to be hollow cartilaginous tubes and of the colour of motherofpearl These tubes are often seen to unite with each other some are perceived to open into the intestines and some go to different parts of the surface of the body That these vessels serve to convey the air appears evidently from the famous expe∣riment of Malpighi who by stopping up the mouths of the stigmata with oil quickly suf∣focated the animal which was seen to die con∣vulsed the instant after In order to ascertain his theory he rubbed oil upon other parts of the insect's body leaving the stigmata free and this seemed to have no effect upon the ani∣mal's health but it continued to move and eat as usual he rubbed oil on the stigmata of one side and the animal underwent a partial con∣vulsion but recovered soon after However it ought to be observed that air is not so ne∣cessary to these as to the nobler ranks of animals since caterpillars will live in an exhausted re∣ceiver for several days together and though  they seem dead at the bottom yet when taken out recover and resume their former vivacity  If the caterpillar be cut open longitudinally along the back its intestines will be perceived running directly in a straight line from the mouth to the anus They resemble a number of small bags opening into each other and strengthened on both sides by a fleshy cord by which they are united These insects are upon many occasions seen to cast forth the internal coat of their intestines with their food in the changes which they so frequently undergo But the intestines take up but a small part of the animal's body if compared to the fatty sub∣stance in which they are involved This sub∣stance changes its colour when the insect's me∣tamorphosis begins to approach and from white it is usually seen to become yellow If to these parts we add the caterpillar's imple∣ments for spinning for all caterpillars spin at one time or another we shall have a rude sketch of this animal's conformation however we shall reserve the description of those parts till we come to the history of the silkworm where the manner in which these insects spin their webs will most properly find place  The life of a caterpillar seems one continued succession of changes and it is seen to throw off  one skin only to assume another which also is divested in its turn and thus for eight or ten times successively We must not however confound this changing of the skin with the great metamorphosis which it is afterwards to undergo The throwing off one skin and assuming another seems in comparison but a slight operation among these animals this is but the work of a day the other is the great adventure of their lives Indeed this faculty of changing the skin is not peculiar to caterpillars only but is common to all the insect kind and even to some animals that claim a higher rank in nature We have already seen the lobster and the crab outgrowing their first shells and then bursting from their confine∣ment in order to assume a covering more roomy and convenient It is probable that the louse the flea and the spider change their covering from the same necessity and growing too large for the crust in which they have been for some time enclosed burst it for another This period is probably that of their growth for as soon as their new skin is hardened round them the animal's growth is necessarily cir∣cumscribed while it remains within it With respect to caterpillars many of them change their skins five or six times in a season and  this covering when cast off often seems so complete that many might mistake the empty skin for the real insect Among the hairy ca∣terpillars for instance the cast skin is covered with hair the feet as well gristly as mem∣braneous remain fixed to it even the parts which nothing but a microscope can discover are visible in it in short all the parts of the head not only the skull but the teeth  In proportion as the time approaches in which the caterpillar is to cast its old skin its colours become more feeble the skin seems to wither and grow dry and in some measure resembles a leaf when it is no longer supplied with moisture from the stock At that time the insect begins to find itself under a necessity of changing and it is not effected without violent labour and perhaps pain A day or two before the critical hour approaches the insect ceases to eat loses its usual activity and seems to rest immoveable It seeks some place to remain in se∣curity and no longer timorous seems regardless even of the touch It is now and then seen to bend itself and elevate its back again it stretches to its utmost extent it sometimes lifts up the head and then lets it fall again it sometimes waves it three or four times from side to side and then remains in quiet At length some of  within from the view but in others where it is more transparent the caterpillar when it has done spinning strikes into it the claws of the two feet under the tail and afterwards forces in the tail itself by contracting those claws and violently striking the feet one against the other If however they be taken from their web at this time they appear in a state of great languor and incapable of walking remain on that spot where they are placed In this condition they remain one or two days pre∣paring to change into an aurelia somewhat in the manner they made preparations for changing their skin They then appear with their bodies bent into a bow which they now and then are seen to straiten they make no use of their legs but if they attempt to change place do it by the contortions of their body In proportion as their change into an aurelia approaches their body becomes more and more bent while their extensions and con∣vulsive contractions become more frequent The hinder end of the body is the part which the animal first disengages from its caterpillar skin that part of the skin remains empty while the body is drawn up contractedly towards the head In the same manner they disengage themselves from the two succeeding rings so  the animal is then lodged entirely in the  fore part of its caterpillar covering that half which is abandoned remains flacid and empty while the fore part on the contrary is swolen and distended The animal having thus quitted the hinder part of its skin to drive itself up into the fore part still continues to heave and work as before so that the skull is soon seen to burst into three pieces and a longitudinal opening is made in the three first rings of the body through which the insect thrusts forth its naked body with strong efforts Thus at last it entirely gets free from its cater∣pillar skin and for ever forsakes its most odious reptile form  The caterpillar thus stripped of its skin for the last time is now become an aurelia in which the parts of the future butterfly are all visible but in so soft a state that the smallest touch can discompose them The animal is now become helpless and motionless but only waits for the assistance of the air to dry up the moisture on its surface and supply it with a crust capable of resisting external injuries Im∣mediately after being stripped of its caterpillar skin it is of a green colour especially in those parts which are distended by an extraordinary afflux of animal moisture but in ten or twelve hours after being thus exposed its parts harden  their glutinous silk make a kind of paste in which they wrap themselves up Many are the forms which these animals assume in this help∣less state and it often happens that the most deformed butterflies issue from the most beau∣tiful aurelias  In general however the aurelia takes the rude outline of the parts of the animal which is contained within it but as to the various co∣lours which it is seen to assume they are rather the effect of accident for the same species of insect does not at all times assume the same hue when it becomes an aurelia In some the beautiful gold colour is at one time found in others it is wanting This brilliant hue which does not fall short of the best gilding is formed in the same manner in which we see leather ob∣tain a gold colour though none of that metal ever enters into the tincture It is only formed by a beautiful brown varnish laid upon a white ground and the white thus gleaming through the transparency of the brown gives a charming golden yellow These two colours are found one over the other in the aurelia of the little animal we are describing and the whole ap∣pears gilded without any real gilding  The aurelia thus formed and left to time to expand into a butterfly in some measure re∣sembles  an animal in an egg that is to wait for external warmth to hatch it into life and vigour As the quantity of moisture that is enclosed within the covering of the aurelia continues to keep its body in the most tender state so it is requisite that this humidity should be dried away before the little butterfly can burst its prison Many have been the experiments to prove that nature may in this respect be assisted by art and that the life of the insect may be retarded or quickened without doing it the smallest injury For this purpose it is only requisite to continue the insect in its aurelia state by preventing the evaporation of its hu∣midity which will consequently add some days nay weeks to its life on the other hand by evaporating its moisture in a warm situation the animal assumes its winged state before its usual time and goes through the offices assigned its existence To prove this Mr Reaumur enclosed the aurelia in a glass tube and found the evaporated water which exhaled from the body of the insect collected in drops at the bottom of the tube he covered the aurelia with varnish and this making the evaporation more difficult and slow the butterfly was two months longer than its natural term in coming out of its case he found on the other hand  that by laying the animal in a warm room he hastened the disclosure of the butterfly and by keeping it in an icehouse in the same manner he delayed it Warmth acted in this case in a double capacity invigorating the animal and evaporating the moisture  The aurelia though it bears a different ex∣ternal appearance nevertheless contains within it all the parts of the butterfly in perfect form∣ation and lying each in a very orderly manner though in the smallest compass These how∣ever are so fast and tender that it is impossible to visit without discomposing them When either by warmth or encreasing vigour the parts have acquired the necessary force and so∣lidity the butterfly then seeks to disembarrass itself of those bands which kept it so long in confinement Some insects continue under the form of an aurelia not above ten days some twenty some several months and even for a year together  The butterfly however does not continue so long under the form of an aurelia as one would be apt to imagine In general those caterpillars that provide hemselves with cones continue within them but a few days after the cone is completely finished Some however remain buried in this artificial covering for eight  or nine months without taking the smallest sustenance during the whole time and though in the caterpillar state no animals were so vora∣cious when thus transformed they appear a miracle of abstinence In all sooner or later the butterfly bursts from its prison not only that natural prison which is formed by the skin of the aurelia but also from that artificial one of silk or any other substance in which it has enclosed itself  The efforts which the butterfly makes to get free from its aurelia state are by no means so violent as those which the insect had in changing from the caterpillar into the aurelia The quan∣tity of moisture surrounding the butterfly is by no means so great as that attending its former change and the shell of the aurelia is so dry that it may be cracked between the fingers  If the animal be shut up within a cone the butterfly always gets rid of the natural internal skin of the aurelia before it eats its way through the external covering which its own industry has formed round it In order to observe the manner in which it thus gets rid of the aurelia covering we must cut open the cone and then we shall have an opportunity of discovering the insect's efforts to emancipate itself from its natural shell When this operation begins there  seems to be a violent agitation in the humours contained within the little animal's body Its fluids seem driven by an hasty fermentation through all the vessels while it labours violently with its legs and makes several other violent struggles to get free As all these motions concur with the growth of the insect's wings and body it is impossible that the brittle skin which covers it should longer resist it at length gives way by bursting into four distinct and regular pieces The skin of the head and legs first separates then the skin at the back flies open and di∣viding into two regular portions disengages the back and wings then there likewise happens another rupture in that portion which covered the rings of the back of the aurelia After this the butterfly as if fatigued with its struggles remains very quiet for some time with its wings pointed downwards and its legs fixed in the skin which it had just thrown off At first sight the animal just set free and permitted the future use of its wings seems to want them entirely they take up such little room that one would wonder where they were hidden But soon after they expand so rapidly that the eye can scarce attend their unfolding From reach∣ing scarce half the length of the body they acquire in a most wonderful manner their full  extent and bigness so as to be each five times larger than they were before Nor is it the wings alone that are thus encreased all their spots and paintings before so minute as to be scarce discernible are proportionably extended so that what a few minutes before seemed only a number of confused unmeaning points now become distinct and most beautiful ornaments Nor are the wings when they are thus ex∣panded unfolded in the manner in which ear∣wigs and grasshoppers display theirs who unfurl them like a lady's fan on the contrary those of butterflies actually grow to their natural size in this very short space The wing at the instant it is freed from its late confinement is con∣siderably thicker than afterwards so that it spreads in all its dimensions growing thinner as it becomes broader If one of the wings be plucked from the animal just set free it may be spread by the fingers and it will soon become as broad as the other which has been left behind As the wings extend themselves so suddenly they have not yet had time to dry and accord∣ingly appear like pieces of wet paper soft and full of wrinkles In about half an hour they are perfectly dry their wrinkles entirely dis∣appear and the little animal assumes all its splendor The transmutation being thus per∣fectly  finished the butterfly discharges three or four drops of a bloodcoloured liquid which are the last remains of its superfluous moisture Those aurelias which are enclosed within a cone find their exit still more difficult as they have still another prison to break through this however they perform in a short time for the butterfly freed from its aurelia skin butts with its head violently against the walls of its artificial prison and probably with its eyes that are rough and like a file it rubs the internal surface away till it is at last seen bursting its way into open light and in less than a quarter of an hour the animal acquires its full per∣fection  Thus to use the words of Swammerdam we see a little insignificant creature distin∣guished in its last birth with qualifications and ornaments which man during his stay upon earth can never even hope to acquire The butterfly to enjoy life needs no other food but the dews of Heaven and the honeyed juices which are distilled from every flower The pageantry of princes cannot equal the orna∣ments with which it is invested nor the rich colouring that embellishes its wings The skies are the butterfly's proper habitation and the air its element whilst man comes into the  world naked and often roves about without habitation or shelter exposed on one hand to the heat of the sun and on the other to the damps and exhalations of the earth both alike enemies of his happiness and existenceA strong proof that while this little animal is raised to its greatest height we are as yet in this world only candidates for perfection  CHAP III Of Butterflies and Moths  IT has been already shewn that all Butterflies are bred from caterpillars and we have exhi∣bited the various circumstances of that sur∣prizing change It has been remarked that butterflies may be easily distinguished from flies of every other kind by their wings for in others they are either transparent like gauze as we see in the common flesh fly or they are hard and crusted as we see in the wings of the beetle But in the butterfly the wings are soft opake and painted over with a beautiful dust that comes off with handling  The number of these beautiful animals is very great and though Linnaeus has reckoned up above seven hundred and sixty different kinds the catalogue is still very incomplete Every collector of butterflies can shew undescribed species and such as are fond of minute dis∣covery can here produce animals that have been examined only by himself In general however those of the warm climates are larger and more beautiful than such as are bred at home and we can easily admit the beauty of  the butterfly since we are thus freed from the damage of the caterpillar It has been the amusement of some to collect these animals from different parts of the world or to breed them from caterpillars at home These they arrange in systematic order or dispose so as to make striking and agreeable pictures and all must grant that this specious idleness is far pre∣ferable to that unhappy state which is produced by a total want of employment  The wings of butterflies as was observed fully distinguish them from flies of every other kind They are four in number and though two of them be cut off the animal can fly with the two others remaining They are in their own substance transparent but owe their opa∣city to the beautiful dust with which they are covered and which has been likened by some naturalists to the feathers of birds by others to the scales of fishes as their imaginations were disposed to catch the resemblance In fact if we regard the wing of a butterfly with a good microscope we shall perceive it studded over with a variety of little grains of different dimensions and forms generally supported upon a footstalk regularly laid upon the whole sur∣face Nothing can exceed the beautiful and regular arrangement of these little substances  which thus serve to paint the butterfly's wing like the tiles of an house Those of one rank are a little covered by those that follow they are of many figures on one part of the wing may be seen a succession of oval studs on ano∣ther part a cluster of studs each in the form of an heart in one place they resemble a hand open and in another they are long or trian∣gular while all are interspersed with taller studs that grow between the rest like mush∣rooms upon a stalk The wing itself is com∣posed of several thick nerves which render the construction very strong though light and though it be covered over with thousands of these scales or studs yet its weight is very little encreased by the number The animal is with ease enabled to support itself a long while in air although its flight be not very graceful When it designs to fly to a considerable distance it ascends and descends alternately going some∣times to the right sometimes to the left with∣out any apparent reason Upon closer exa∣mination however it will be found that it flies thus irregularly in pursuit of its mate and as dogs bait and quarter the ground in pursuit of their game so these insects traverse the air in quest of their mates whom they can discover at more than a mile's distance  If we prosecute our description of the but∣terfly the animal may be divided into three parts the head the corselet and the body  The body is the hinder part of the butterfly and is composed of rings which are generally concealed under long hair with which that part of the animal is cloathed The corselet is more solid than the rest of the body because the fore wings and the legs are fixed therein The legs are six in number although four only are made use of by the animal the two fore legs being often so much concealed in the long hair of the body that it is sometimes difficult to discover them If we examine these parts in∣ternally we shall find the same set of vessels in the butterfly that we observed in the caterpillar but with this great difference that as the blood or humours in the caterpillar circulated from the tail to the head they are found in the but∣terfly to take a direct contrary course and to circulate from the head to the tail so that the caterpillar may be considered as the embryo animal in which as we have formerly seen the circulation is carried on differently from what it is in animals when excluded  But leaving the other parts of the butterfly let us turn our attention particularly to the head The eyes of butterflies have not all the same  form for in some they are large in others small in some they are the larger portion of a sphere in others they are but a small part of it and just appearing from the head In all of them however the outward coat has a lustre in which may be discovered the various colours of the rainbow When examined a little closely it will be found to have the ap∣pearance of a multiplying glass having a great number of sides or facets in the man∣ner of a brilliant cut diamond In this par∣ticular the eye of the butterfly and of most other insects entirely correspond and Luen∣hoek pretends there are above six thousand facets on the cornea of a flea These animals therefore see not only with great clearness but view every object multiplied in a surprizing manner Puget adapted the cornea of a fly in such a position as to see objects through it by the means of a microscope and nothing could exceed the strangeness of its representations a soldier who was seen through it appeared like an army of pigmies for while it multi∣plied it also diminished the object the arch of a bridge exhibited a spectacle more magni∣ficent than human skill could perform the flame of a candle seemed a beautiful illumi∣nation It still however remains a doubt  whether the insect sees objects singly as with one eye or whether every facet is itself a com∣plete eye exhibiting its own object distinct from all the rest  Butterflies as well as most other flying insects have two instruments like horns on their heads which are commonly called feelers They dif∣fer from the horns of greater animals in being moveable at their base and in having a great number of joints by which means the insect is enabled to turn them in every direction Those of butterflies are placed at the top of the head pretty near the external edge of each eye What the use of these instruments may be which are thus formed with so much art and by a Work∣man who does nothing without reason is as yet unknown to man They may serve to guard the eye they may be of use to clean it or they may be the organ of some sense which we are ignorant of but this is only explaining one difficulty by another  We are not so ignorant of the uses of the trunk which few insects of the butterfly kind are without This instrument is placed exactly between the eyes and when the animal is not employed in seeking its nourishment it is rolled up like a curl A butterfly when it is feeding flies round some flower and settles upon it  The trunk is then uncurled and thrust out either wholly or in part and is employed in searching the flower to its very bottom let it be never so deep This search being repeated seven or eight times the butterfly then passes to another and continues to hover over those agreeable to its taste like a bird over its prey This trunk consists of two equal hollow tubes nicely joined to each other like the pipes of an organ  Such is the figure and conformation of these beautiful insects that cheer our walks and give us the earliest intimations of summer But it is not by day alone that they are seen fluttering wantonly from flower to flower as the greatest number of them fly by night and ex∣pand the most beautiful colouring at those hours when there is no spectator This tribe of insects has therefore been divided into Di∣urnal and Nocturnal Flies or more properly speaking into Butterflies and Moths the one only flying by day the other most usually on the wing in the night They may be easily distinguished from each other by their horns or feelers those of the butterfly being clubbed or knobbed at the end those of the moth tapering finer and finer to a point To express it technicallythe feelers of butterflies are cla∣vated those of moths are filiform  The butterflies as well as the moths employ the short life assigned them in a variety of en∣joyments Their whole time is spent either in quest of food which every flower offers or in pursuit of the female whose approach they can often perceive at above two miles distance Their sagacity in this particular is not less asto∣nishing than true but by what sense they are thus capable of distinguishing each other at such distances is not easy to conceive It cannot be by the sight since such small objects as they are must be utterly imperceptible at half the distance at which they perceive each other it can scarcely be by the sense of smelling since the animal has no organs for that purpose Whatever be their powers of perception certain it is that the male after having fluttered as if carelesly about for some time is seen to take wing and go forward sometimes for two miles together in a direct line to where the female is perched on a flower  The general rule among insects is that the female is larger than the male and this obtains particularly in the tribe I am describing The body of the male is smaller and slenderer that of the female more thick and oval Previous to the junction of these animals they are seen sporting in the air pursuing and flying from  each other and preparing by a mock combat for the more important business of their lives If they be disturbed while united the female flies off with the male on her back who seems entirely passive upon the occasion  But the females of many moths and butterflies seem to have assumed their airy form for no other reason but to fecundate their eggs and lay them They are not seen fluttering about in quest of food or a mate all that passes during their short lives is a junction with the male of about half an hour after which they deposite their eggs and die without taking any nourishment or seeking any It may be ob∣served however that in all the females of this tribe they are impregnated by the male by one aperture and lay their eggs by another  The eggs of female butterflies are disposed in the body like a bed of chaplets which when excluded are usually oval and of a whitish colour some however are quite round and others flatted like a turnip The covering or shell of the egg though solid is thin and trans∣parent and in proportion as the caterpillar grows within the egg the colours change and are distributed differently The butterfly seems very well instructed by nature in its choice of the plant or the leaf where it shall deposite its  burthen Each egg contains but one caterpillar and it is requisite that this little animal when excluded should be near its peculiar provision The butterfly therefore is careful to place her brood only upon those plants that afford good nourishment to its posterity Though the little winged animal has been fed itself upon dew or the honey of flowers yet it makes choice for its young of a very different provision and lays its eggs on the most unsavoury plants the rag∣weed the cabbage or the nettle Thus every butterfly chuses not the plant most grateful to it in its winged state but such as it has fed upon in its reptile form  All the eggs of butterflies are attached to the leaves of the favourite plant by a sort of size or glue where they continue unobserved unless carefully sought after The eggs are sometimes placed round the tender shoots of plants in the form of bracelets consisting of above two hundred in each and generally surrounding the shoot like a ring upon a finger Some butterflies secure their eggs from the injuries of air by covering them with hair plucked from their own bodies as birds sometimes are seen to make their nests so that their eggs are thus kept warm and also entirely concealed  All the tribe of female moths lay their eggs a short time after they leave the aurelia but there are many butterflies that flutter about the whole summer and do not think of laying till the winter begins to warn them of their ap∣proaching end some even continue the whole winter in the hollows of trees and do not pro∣vide for posterity until the beginning of April when they leave their retreats deposite their eggs and die Their eggs soon begin to feel the genial influence of the season the little animals burst from them in their caterpillar state to become aurelias and butterflies in their turn and thus to continue the round of nature  CHAP IV Of the Enemies of the Caterpillar  NATURE though it has rendered some animals surprizingly fruitful yet ever takes care to prevent their too great encrease One set of creatures is generally opposed to another and those are chiefly the most prolific that are from their imbecility incapable of making any effectual defence The caterpillar has perhaps of all other animals the greatest number of enemies and seems only to exist by its sur∣prizing fecundity Some animals devour them by hundreds others more minute yet more dangerous mangle them in various ways so that how great soever their numbers may be their destroyers are in equal proportion In∣deed if we consider the mischiefs these reptiles are capable of occasioning and the various da∣mages we sustain from their insatiable rapacity it is happy for the other ranks of nature that there are thousands of fishes birds and even insects that live chiefly upon caterpillars and make them their most favourite repast  When we described the little birds that live in our gardens and near our houses as de∣structive  neighbours sufficient attention was not paid to the services which they are fre∣quently found to render us It has been proved that a single sparrow and its mate that have young ones destroy above three thousand ca∣terpillars in a week not to mention several butterflies in which numberless caterpillars are destroyed in embryo It is in pursuit of these reptiles that we are favoured with the visits of many of our most beautiful songsters that amuse us during their continuance and leave us when the caterpillars disappear  The maxim which has often been urged against man that he of all other animals is the only creature that is an enemy to his own kind and that the human species only are found to destroy each other has been adopted by persons who never considered the history of insects Some of the caterpillar kind in par∣ticular that seem fitted only to live upon leaves and plants will however eat each other and the strongest will devour the weak in pre∣ference to their vegetable food That which lives upon the oak is found to seize any of its companions which it conveniently can by the first rings and inflict a deadly wound it then feasts in tranquillity on its prey and leaves no∣thing of the animal but the husk  But it is not from each other they have most to fear as in general they are inoffensive and many of this tribe are found to live in a kind of society Many kinds of flies lay their eggs either upon or within their bodies and as these turn into worms the caterpillar is seen to nourish a set of intestine enemies within its body that must shortly be its destruction Nature having taught flies as well as all other animals the surest methods of perpetuating their kind  "Towards the end of August" says Reaumur "I perceived a little fly of a beautiful gold colour busily employed in the body of a large caterpillar of that kind which feeds upon cabbage I gently separated that part of the leaf on which these insects were placed from the rest of the plant and placed it where I might observe them more at my ease The fly wholly taken up by the business in which it was employed walked along the cater∣pillar's body now and then remaining fixed to a particular spot Upon this occasion I perceived it every now and then dart a sting which it carried at the end of its tail into the caterpillar's body and then drew it out again to repeat the same operation in another place It was not difficult for me to conjecture the business which engaged this animal so ear∣nestly  its whole aim was to deposite its eggs in the caterpillar's body which was to serve as a proper retreat for bringing them to per∣fection The reptile thus rudely treated seemed to bear all very patiently only mov∣ing a little when stung too deeply which however the fly seemed entirely to disregard I took particular care to feed this caterpillar which seemed to me to continue as voracious and vigorous as any of the rest of its kind In about ten or twelve days it changed into an aurelia which seemed gradually to decline and died upon examining its internal parts the animal was entirely devoured by worms which however did not come to perfection as it is probable they had not enough to sustain them within"  What the French philosopher perceived upon this occasion is every day to be seen in several of the larger kinds of caterpillars whose bodies serve as a nest to various flies that very carefully deposite their eggs within them The large cabbage caterpillar is so subject to its injuries that at certain seasons it is much easier to find them with than without them The ichnumon fly as it is called particularly infests these rep∣tiles and prevents their fecundity This fly is of all others the most formidable to insects of  various kinds The spider that destroys the ant the moth and the butterfly yet often falls a prey to the ichnumon who pursues the robber to his retreat and despising his nets tears him in pieces in the very labyrinth he has made This insect as redoubtable as the little quadru∣pede that destroys the crocodile has received the same name and from its destruction of the caterpillar tribe is probably more serviceable to mankind This insect I say makes the body of the caterpillar the place for depositing its eggs to the number of ten fifteen or twenty As they are laid in those parts which are not mortal the reptile still continues to live and to feed shewing no signs of being incommoded by its new guests The caterpillar changes its skin and sometimes undergoes the great change into an aurelia but still the fatal intruders work within and secretly devour its internal sub∣stance soon after they are seen bursting through its skin and moving away in order to spin them∣selves a covering previous to their own little transformation It is indeed astonishing some∣times to see the number of worms and those pretty large that thus issue from the body of a single caterpillar and eat their way through its skin but it is more extraordinary still that they should remain within the body devouring its  entrails without destroying its life The truth is they seem instructed by nature not to devour its vital parts for they are found to feed only upon that fatty substance which composes the largest part of the caterpillar's body When this surprizing appearance was first observed it was supposed that the animal thus gave birth to a number of flies different from itself and that the same caterpillar sometimes bred an ichnumon and sometimes a butterfly but it was not till after more careful inspection it was discovered that the ichnumon tribe were not the caterpillar's offspring but its murderers  CHAP V Of the Silkworm  HAVING mentioned in the last chapter the damages inflicted by the caterpillar tribe we now come to an animal of this kind that alone compensates for all the mischief occasioned by the rest This little creature which only works for itself has been made of the utmost service to man and furnishes him with a covering more beautiful than any other animal can supply We may declaim indeed against the luxuries of the times when silk is so generally worn but were such garments to fail what other arts could supply their deficiency  Though silk was anciently brought in small quantities to Rome yet it was so scarce as to be sold for its weight in gold and was considered as such a luxurious refinement in dress that it was infamous for a man to appear in habits of which silk formed but half the composition It was most probably brought among them from the remotest parts of the east since it was at the time of which I am speaking scarcely known even in Persia  Nothing can be more remote from the truth  than the manner in which their historians describe the animal by which silk is produced Pausanias informs us that silk came from the country of the Seres a people of Asiatic Scy∣thia in which place an insect as large as the beetle but in every other respect resembling a spider was bred up for that purpose They take great care as he assures us to feed and defend it from the weather as well during the summer's heat as the rigours of winter This insect he observes makes its web with its feet of which it has eight in number It is fed for the space of four years upon a kind of paste prepared for it and at the beginning of the fifth it is supplied with the leaves of the green willow of which it is particularly fond It then feeds till it bursts with fat after which they take out its bowels which are spun into the beautiful manufacture so scarce and costly  The real history of this animal was unknown among the Romans till the times of Justinian and it is supposed that silkworms were not brought into Europe till the beginning of the twelfth century when Roger of Sicily brought workmen in this manufacture from Asia Minor after his return from his expedition to the Holy Land and settled them in Sicily and Calabria From these the other kingdoms of Europe  learned this manufacture and it is now one of the most lucrative carried on among the southern provinces of Europe  The silkworm is now very well known to be a large caterpillar of a whitish colour with twelve feet and producing a butterfly of the moth kind The cone on which it spins is formed for covering it while it continues in the aurelia state and several of these properly wound off and united together form those strong and beautiful threads which is woven into silk The feeding these worms the gathering the winding the twisting and the weaving their silk is one of the principal manufactures of Europe and as our luxuries encrease seems every day to become more and more necessary to human happiness  There are two methods of breeding silk∣worms for they may be left to grow and re∣main at liberty upon the trees where they are hatched or they may be kept in a place built for that purpose and fed every day with fresh leaves The first method is used in China Tonquin and other hot countries the other is used in those places where the animal has been artificially propagated and still continues a stranger In the warm climates the silkworm proceeds from an egg which has been glued  by the parent moth upon proper parts of the mulberrytree and which remains in that situa∣tion during the winter The manner in which they are situated and fixed to the tree keeps them unaffected by the influence of the wea∣ther so that those frosts which are severe enough to kill the tree have no power to injure the silkworm  The insect never proceeds from the egg till Nature has provided it a sufficient supply and till the budding leaves are furnished in suffi∣cient abundance for its support When the leaves are put forth the worms seem to feel the genial summons and bursting from their little eggs crawl upon the leaves where they feed with a most voracious appetite Thus they become larger by degrees and after some months feeding they lay upon every leaf small bundles or cones of silk which appear like so many golden apples painted on a fine green ground Such is the method of breeding them in the East and without doubt it is best for the worms and least troublesome for the feeder of them But it is otherwise in our colder European climates the frequent changes of the weather and the heavy dews of our even∣ings render the keeping them all night exposed subject to so many inconveniences as to admit  of no remedy It is true that by the assistance of nets they may be preserved from the insults of birds but the severe cold weather which often succeeds the first heats of summer as well as the rain and high winds will destroy them all and therefore to breed them in Europe they must be sheltered and protected from every external injury  For this purpose a room is chosen with a south aspect and the windows are so well glazed as not to admit the least air the walls are well built and the planks of the floor ex∣ceeding close so as to admit neither birds nor mice nor even so much as an insect In the middle there should be four pillars erected or four wooden posts so placed as to form a pretty large square Between these are different stories made with ozier hurdles and under each hur∣dle there should be a floor with an upright bor∣der all round These hurdles and floors must hang upon pullies so as to be placed or taken down at pleasure  When the worms are hatched some tender mulberry leaves are provided and placed in the cloth or paper box in which the eggs were laid and which are large enough to hold a great number When they have acquired some strength they must be distributed on beds of  mulberry leaves in the different stories of the square in the middle of the room round which a person may freely pass on every side They will fix themselves to the leaves and afterwards to the sticks of the hurdles when the leaves are devoured They have then a thread by which they can suspend themselves on occasion to pre∣vent any shock by a fall but this is by no means to be considered as the silk which they spin afterwards in such abundance Care must be taken that fresh leaves be brought every morning which must be strewed very gently and equally over them upon which the silk∣worms will forsake the remainder of the old leaves which must be carefully taken away and every thing kept very clean for nothing hurts these insects so much as moisture and unclean∣liness For this reason their leaves must be gathered when the weather is dry and kept in a dry place if it be necessary to lay in a store As these animals have but a short time to live they make use of every moment and almost continually are spinning except at those in∣tervals when they change their skins If mul∣berry leaves be difficult to be obtained the leaves of lettuce or holyoak will sustain them but they do not thrive so well upon their new diet and their silk will neither be so copious nor of so good a quality  Though the judicious choice and careful management of their diet is absolutely ne∣cessary yet there is another precaution of equal importance which is to give them air and open their chamber windows at such times as the sun shines warmest The place also must be kept as clean as possible not only the several floors that are laid to receive their ordure but the whole apartments in general These things well observed contribute greatly to their health and encrease  The worm at the the time it bursts the shell is extremely small and of a black colour but the head is of a more shining black than the rest of the body some days after they begin to turn whitish or of an ashcoloured grey After the skin begins to grow too rigid or he animal is stinted within it the insect throws it off and appears cloathed anew it then be∣comes larger and much whiter though it has a greenish cast after some days which are more or less according to the different heat of the climate or to the quality of the food it leaves off eating and seems to sleep for two days together then it begins to stir and put itself into violent motions till the skin falls off the second time and is thrown aside by the animal's feet All these changes are made in three weeks  may easily be observed is that it is composed externally of a kind of rough cottonlike sub∣stance which is called floss within the thread is more distinct and even and next the body of the aurelia the apartment seems lined with a substance of the hardness of paper but of a much stronger consistence It must not be sup∣posed that the thread which goes to compose the cone is rolled round as we roll a bottom on the contrary it lies upon it in a very irre∣gular manner and winds off now from one side of the cone and then from the other This whole thread if measured will be found about three hundred yards long and so very fine that eight or ten of them are generally rolled off into one by the manufacturers The cone when completed is in form like a pidgeon's egg and more pointed at one end than the other at the smaller end the head of the aurelia is generally found and this is the place that the insect when converted into a moth is generally seen to burst through  It is generally a fortnight or three weeks before the aurelia is changed into a moth but no sooner is the winged insect completely formed than having divested itself of its aurelia skin it prepares to burst through its cone or outward prison for this purpose it extends its  head towards the point of the cone butts with its eyes which are rough against the lining of its cell wears it away and at last pushes for∣ward through a passage which is small at first but which enlarges as the animal encreases its efforts for emancipation while the tattered rem∣nants of its aurelia skin lie in confusion within the cone like a bundle of dirty linen  The animal when thus set free from its double confinement appears exhausted with fatigue and seems produced for no other pur∣pose but to transmit a future brood It neither flies nor eats the male only seeking the female whose eggs he impregnates and their union continues for four days without interruption The male dies immediately after separation from his mate and she survives him only till she has laid her eggs which are not hatched into worms till the ensuing spring  However there are few of these animals suf∣fered to come to a state of maturity for as their bursting through the cone destroys the silk the manufacturers take care to kill the aurelia by exposing it to the sun before the moth comes to perfection This done they take off the floss and throw the cones into warm water stirring them till the first thread offers them a clue for winding all off They generally take eight of  the silken threads together the cones still kept under water till a proper quantity of the silk is wound off however they do not take all for the latter parts grow weak and are of a bad colour As to the paperlike substance which remains some stain it with a variety of colours to make artificial flowers others let it lie in the water till the glutinous matter which cements it is all dissolved it is then carded like wool spun with a wheel and converted into silk stuffs of an inferior kind  PART IV  CHAP I Of the Fourth Order of Insects  IN the foregoing part we treated of cater∣pillars changing into butterflies in the present will be given the history of grubs changing into their corresponding winged animals These like the former undergo their transformation and appear as grubs or maggots as aurelias and at last as winged insects Like the former they are bred from eggs they feed in their reptile state they continue motionless and lifeless as aurelias and fly and propagate when furnished with wings But they differ in many respects the grub or maggot wants the number of feet which the caterpillar is seen to have the aurelia is not so totally wrapped up but that its feet and its wings appear The perfect animal when emancipated also has its wings either cased or transparent like gauze not coloured with that beautifully painted dust which adorns the wings of the butterfly  In this class of insects therefore we may place a various tribe that are first laid as eggs then are excluded as maggots or grubs then change  into aurelias with their legs and wings not wrapped up but appearing and lastly assum∣ing wings in which state they propagate their kind Some of these have four transparent wings as bees some have two membranous cases to their wings as beetles and some have but two wings which are transparent as ants Here therefore we will place the bee the wasp the humble bee the ichnumon fly the gnat the tipula or longlegs the bettle the maybug the glowworm and the ant The transformations which all these undergo are pretty nearly similar and though very different animals in form are yet produced nearly in the same manner  CHAP II Of the Bee  TO give a complete history of this insect in a few pages which some have exhausted vo∣lumes in describing and whose nature and pro∣perties still continue in dispute is impossible It will be sufficient to give a general idea of the animal's operations which though they have been studied for more than two thousand years are still but incompletely known The account given us by Reaumur is sufficiently minute and if true sufficiently wonderful but I find many of the facts which he relates doubted by those who are most conversant with bees and some of them actually declared not to have a real existence in nature  It is unhappy therefore for those whose me∣thod demands an history of bees that they are unfurnished with those materials which have in∣duced so many observers to contradict so great a naturalist His life was spent in the contem∣plation and it requires an equal share of at∣tention to prove the error of his discoveries Without entering therefore into the di  pute I will take him for my guide and just mention  as I go along those particulars in which suc∣ceeding observers have begun to think him er∣roneous Which of the two are right time only can discover for my part I have only heard one side for as yet none have been so bold as openly to oppose Reaumur's delightful researches  There are three different kinds of bees in every hive First the labouring bees which make up the far greatest number and are thought to be neither male or female but merely born for the purposes of labour and continuing the breed by supplying the young with provision while yet in their helpless state The second sort are the drones they are of a darker colour longer and more thick by one third than the former they are supposed to be the males and there is not above a hundred of them in a hive of seven or eight thousand bees The third sort is much larger than either of the former and still fewer in number some assert that there is not above one in every swarm but this later observers affirm not to be true there being sometimes five or six in the same hive These are called queen bees and are said to lay all the eggs from which the whole swarm is hatched in a season  In examining the structure of the common working bee the first remarkable part that  offers is the trunk which serves to extract the honey from flowers It is not formed like that of other flies in the manner of a tube by which the fluid is to be sucked up but like a besom to sweep or a tongue to lick it away The animal is furnished also with teeth which serve it in making wax This substance is gathered from flowers like honey it consists of that dust or farina which contribute to the fecundation of plants and is molded into wax by the little animal at leisure Every bee when it leaves the hive to collect this precious store enters into the cup of the flower particularly such as seem charged with the greatest quantities of this yellow farina As the animal's body is covered over with hair it rolls itself within the flower and soon becomes quite covered with the dust which it soon after brushes off with its two hind legs and kneads into two little balls In the thighs of the hind legs there are two cavities edged with hair and into these as into a basket the animal sticks its pellets Thus employed the bee flies from flower to flower encreasing its store and adding to its stock of wax until the ball upon each thigh becomes as big as a grain of pepper by this time having got a sufficient load it returns making the best of its way to the hive  The belly of the bee is divided into six rings which sometime shorten the body by slipping one over the other It contains within it beside the intestines the honeybag the venombag and the sting The honeybag is as transparent as chrystal containing the honey that the bee has brushed from the flowers of which the greater part is carried to the hive and poured into the cells of the honeycomb while the re∣mainder serves for the bee's own nourishment for during summer it never touches what has been laid up for the winter The sting which serves to defend this little animal from its enemies is composed of three parts the sheath and two darts which are extremely small and penetrating Both the darts have several small points or barbs like those of a fishhook which renders the sting more painful and makes the darts rankle in the wound Still however this instrument would be very slight did not the bee poison the wound The sheath which has a sharp point makes the first impression which is followed by that of the darts and then the venomous liquor is poured in The sheath sometimes sticks so fast in the wound that the animal is obliged to leave it behind by which the bee soon after dies and the wound is con∣siderably enflamed It might at first appear  well for mankind if the bee were without its sting but upon recollection it will be found that the little animal would then have too many rivals in sharing its labours An hundred other lazy animals fond of honey and hating la∣bour would intrude upon the sweets of the hive and the treasure would be carried off for want of armed guardians to protect it  From examining the bee singly we now come to consider it in society as an animal not only subject to laws but active vigilant laborious and disinterested All its provisions are laid up for the community and all its arts in building a cell designed for the benefit of posterity The substance with which bees build their cells is wax which is fashioned into convenient apart∣ments for themselves and their young When they begin to work in their hives they divide themselves into four companies one of which roves in the fields in search of materials another employs itself in laying out the bottom and par∣titions of their cells a third is employed in making the inside smooth from the corners and angles and the fourth company bring food for the rest or relieve those who return with their respective burthens But they are not kept constant to one employment they often change the tasks assigned them those that have been  at work being permitted to go abroad and those that have been in the fields already take their places They seem even to have signs by which they understand each other for when any of them want food it bends down its trunk to the bee from whom it is expected which then opens its honeybag and lets some drops fall into the other's mouth which is at that time opened to receive it Their diligence and labour is so great that in a day's time they are able to make cells which lie upon each other numerous enough to contain three thousand bees  If we examine their cells they will be found formed in the exactest proportion It was said by Pappus an ancient geometrician that of all other figures hexagons were the most con∣venient for when placed touching each other the most convenient room would be given and the smallest lost The cells of the bees are per∣fect hexagons these in every honeycomb are double opening on either side and closed at the bottom The bottoms are composed of little triangular panes which when united together terminate in a point and lie exactly upon the extremities of other panes of the same shape in opposite cells These lodgings have spaces like streets between them large enough to give the  bees a free passage in and out and yet narrow enough to preserve the necessary heat The mouth of every cell is defended by a border which makes the door a little less than the inside of the cell which serves to strengthen the whole These cells serve for different pur∣poses for laying up their young for their wax which in winter becomes a part of their food and for their honey which makes their principal subsistence  It is well known that the habitation of bees ought to be very close and what their hives want from the negligence or unskilfulness of man these animals supply by their own industry so that it is their principal care when first hived to stop up all the crannies For this purpose they make use of a resinous gum which is more tenacious than wax and differs greatly from it This the ancients called Propolis it will grow considerably hard in June though it will in some measure soften by heat and is often found different in consistence colour and smell It has generally an agreeable aromatic odour when it is warmed and by some it is considered as a most grateful perfume When the bees begin to work with it it is soft but it acquires a firmer consistence every day till at length it assumes a brown colour and becomes much  harder than wax The bees carry it on their hinder legs and some think it is met with on the birch the willow and poplar However it is procured it is certain that they plaister the inside of their hives with this composition  If examined through a glass hive from the hurry the whole swarm is in the whole at first appears like anarchy and confusion but the spectator soon finds every animal diligently em∣ployed and following one pursuit with a set∣tled purpose Their teeth are the instruments by which they model and fashion their various buildings and give them such symmetry and perfection They begin at the top of the hive and several of them work at a time at the cells which have two faces If they are stinted with regard to time they give the new cells but half the depth which they ought to have leaving them imperfect till they have sketched out the number of cells necessary for the present occasion The construction of their combs costs them a great deal of labour they are made by insen∣sible additions and not cast at once in a mold as some are apt to imagine There seems no end of their shaping finishing and turning them neatly up The cells for their young are most carefully formed those designed for lodging the drones are larger than the rest  and that for the queenbee the largest of all The cells in which the young brood are lodged serve at different times for containing honey and this proceeds from an obvious cause every worm before it is transformed into an aurelia hangs its old skin on the partitions of its cell and thus while it strengthens the wall dimi∣nishes the capacity of its late apartment The same cell in a single summer is often tenanted by three or four worms in succession and the next season by three or four more Each worm takes particular care to fortify the pannels of its cell by hanging up its spoils there thus the partitions being lined six or eight deep become at last too narrow for a new brood and are converted into storehouses for honey  Those cells where nothing but honey is de∣posited are much deeper than the rest When the harvest of honey is so plentiful that they have not sufficient room for it they either lengthen their combs or build more which are much longer than the former Sometimes they work at three combs at a time for when there are three workhouses more bees may be thus employed without embarrassing each other  But honey as was before observed is not the only food upon which these animals subsist  The meal of flowers of which their wax is formed is one of their most favourite repasts This is a diet which they live upon during the summer and of which they lay up a large winter provision The wax of which their combs are made is no more than this meal digested and wrought into a paste When the flowers upon which bees generally feed are not fully blown and this meal or dust is not offered in sufficient quantities the bees pinch the tops of the stamina in which it is contained with their teeth and thus anticipate the progress of vegetation In April and May the bees are busy from morning to evening in gathering this meal but when the weather becomes too hot in the midst of summer they work only in the morning  The bee is furnished with a stomach for its wax as well as its honey In the former of the two their powder is altered digested and concocted into real wax and is thus ejected by the same passage by which it was swallowed Every comb newly made is white but it be∣comes yellow as it grows old and almost black when kept too long in the hive Beside the wax thus digested there is a large portion of the powder kneaded up for food in every hive and kept in separate cells for winter provision  This is called by the country people beebread and contributes to the health and strength of the animal during winter Those who rear bees may rob them of their honey and feed them during the winter with treacle but no proper substitute has yet been found for the beebread and without it the animals become consumptive and die  As for the honey it is extracted from that part of the flower called the nectareum From the mouth this delicious fluid passes into the gullet and then into the first stomach or honeybag which when filled appears like an oblong bladder Children that live in country places are well acquainted with this bladder and destroy many bees to come at their store of honey When a bee has sufficiently filled its first stomach it returns back to the hive where it disgorges the honey into one of the cells It often happens that the bee delivers its store to some other at the mouth of the hive and flies off for a fresh supply Some honeycombs are always left open for common use but many others are stopped up till there is a necessity of opening them Each of these are covered care∣fully with wax so close that the covers seem to be made at the very instant the fluid is de∣posited within them  Having thus given a cursory description of the insect individually considered and of the habitation it forms we next come to its social habits and institutions and in considering this little animal attentively after the necessary pre∣cautions for the immediate preservation of the community its second care is turned to the continuance of posterity How numerous soever the multitude of bees may appear in one swarm yet they all owe their original to a single parent which is called the queenbee It is indeed surprizing that a single insect shall in one summer give birth to above twenty thousand young but upon opening her body the wonder will cease as the number of eggs appearing at one time amounts to five thousand This animal whose existence is of such importance to her subjects may easily be distinguished from the rest by her size and the shape of her body On her safety depends the whole wel∣fare of the commonwealth and the attentions paid her by all the rest of the swarm evidently shew the dependence her subjects have upon her security If this insect be carefully observed she will be seen at times attended with a nu∣merous retinue marching from cell to cell plunging the extremity of her body into many of them and leaving a small egg in each  The bees which generally compose her train are thought to be males which serve to im∣pregnate her by turns These are larger and blacker than the common bees without stings and without industry They seem formed only to transmit a posterity and to attend the queen whenever she thinks proper to issue from the secret retreats of the hive where she most usually resides Upon the union of these two kinds depends all expectations of a future pro∣geny for the working bees are of no sex and only labour for another offspring yet such is their attention to their queen that if she hap∣pens to die they will leave off working and take no farther care of posterity If however another queen is in this state of universal despair presented them they immediately acknowledge her for sovereign and once more diligently ap∣ply to their labour It must be observed how∣ever that all this fertility of the queenbee and the great attentions paid to her by the rest are controverted by more recent observers They assert that the common bees are parents themselves that they deposite their eggs in the cells which they have prepared that the females are impregnated by the males and bring forth a progeny which is wholly their own  However to go on with their history as  delivered us by Mr ReaumurWhen the queenbee has deposited the number of eggs necessary in the cells the working bees under∣take the care of the rising posterity They are seen to leave off their usual employments to construct proper receptacles for eggs or to complete those that are already formed They purposely build little cells extremely solid for the young in which they employ a great deal of wax those designed for lodging the males as was already observed are larger than the rest and those for the queenbees the largest of all There is usually but one egg deposited in every cell but when the fecundity of the queen is such that it exceeds the number of cells already pre∣pared there are sometimes three or four eggs crowded together in the same apartment But this is an inconvenience that the working bees will by no means suffer They seem sensible that two young ones stuffed up in the same cell when they grow larger will but embarrass and at last destroy each other they therefore take care to leave a cell to every egg and remove or destroy the rest  The single egg that is left remaining is fixed to the bottom of the cell and touches it but in a single point A day or two after it is depo∣sited the worm is excluded from the shell of  the egg having the appearance of a maggot rolled up in a ring and lying softly on a bed of a whitish coloured jelly upon which also the little animal begins to feed In the mean time the instant it appears the working bees attend it with the most anxious and parental tenderness they furnish it every hour with a supply of this whitish substance on which it feeds and lies and watch the cell with unre∣mitting care They are nurses that have a greater affection for the offspring of others than many parents have for their own children They are constant in visiting each cell and seeing that nothing is wanting preparing the white mixture which is nothing but a compo∣sition of honey and wax in their own bowels with which they feed them Thus attended and plentifully fed the worm in less than six days time comes to its full growth and no longer accepts the food offered it When the bees perceive that it has no further occasion for feeding they perform the last offices of ten∣derness and shut the little animal up in its cell walling up the mouth of its apartment with wax there they leave the worm to itself having secured it from every external injury  The worm is no sooner left enclosed but from a state of inaction it begins to labour  extending and shortening its body and by this means lining the walls of its apartment with a silken tapestry which it spins in the manner of caterpillars before they undergo their last transformation When their cell is thus pre∣pared the animal is soon after transformed into an aurelia but differing from that of the com∣mon caterpillar as it exhibits not only the legs but the wings of the future bee in its present state of inactivity Thus in about twenty or one and twenty days after the egg was laid the bee is completely formed and fitted to undergo the fatigues of its state When all its parts have acquired their proper strength and con∣sistence the young animal opens its prison by piercing with its teeth the waxen door that con∣fines it When just freed from its cell it is as yet moist and incommoded with the spoils of its former situation but the officious bees are soon seen to flock round it and to lick it clean on all sides with their trunks while another band with equal assiduity are observed to feed it with honey others again begin immediately to cleanse the cell that has been just left to carry the or∣dures out of the hive and to fit the place for a new inhabitant The young bee soon repays their care by its industry for as soon as ever its external parts become dry it discovers its na∣tural  appetites for labour and industriously be∣gins the task which it pursues unremittingly through life The toil of man is irksome to him and he earns his subsistance with pain but this little animal seems happy in its pur∣suits and finds delight in all its employments  When just freed from the cell and pro∣perly equipped by its fellow bees for duty it at once issues from the hive and instructed only by nature goes in quest of flowers chuses only those that yield it a supply rejects such as are barren of honey or have been already drained by other adventurers and when load∣ed is never at a loss to find its way back to the common habitation After this first sally it begins to gather the mealy powder that lies on every flower which is afterwards converted into wax and with this the very first day it returns with two large balls stuck to its thighs  When bees first begin to break their prisons there are generally above a hundred excluded in one day Thus in the space of a few weeks the number of the inhabitants in one hive of moderate size becomes so great that there is no place to contain the new comers and they are scarcely excluded from the cell when they are obliged by the old bees to sally forth in quest of new habitations In other words the  hive begins to swarm and the new progeny prepares for exile  While there is room enough in the hive the bees remain quietly together it is necessity alone that compels the separation Sometimes indeed the young brood with graceless ob∣stinacy refuse to depart and even venture to resist their progenitors The young ones are known by being browner than the old with whiter hair the old ones are of a lighter co∣lour with red hair The two armies are therefore easily distinguishable and dreadful battles are often seen to ensue But the victory almost ever terminates with strict poetical justice in favour of the veterans and the re∣bellious offspring are driven off not without loss and mutilation  In different countries the swarms make their appearance at different times of the year and there are several signs previous to this in∣tended migration The night before an un∣usual buzzing is heard in the hive in the morning though the weather be soft and in∣viting they seem not to obey the call being intent on more important meditations within All labour is discontinued in the hive every bee is either employed in forcing or reluctant∣ly yielding a submission at length after some  noise and tumult a queen bee is chosen to guard rather than conduct the young colony to other habitations and then they are marshalled with∣out any apparent conductor In less than a minute they leave their native abode and form∣ing a cloud round their protectress they set off without seeming to know the place of their desti∣nation  The world before them where to chuse their place of rest  The usual time of swarming is from ten in the morning to three in the afternoon when the sun shines bright and invites them to seek their fortunes They flutter for a while in the air like flakes of snow and sometimes un∣dertake a distant journey but more frequently are contented with some neighbouring asylum the branch of a tree a chimney top or some other exposed situation It is indeed remark∣able that all those animals of what ever kind that have long been under the protection of man seem to lose a part of their natural saga∣city in providing for themselves The rabbit when domesticated forgets to dig holes the hen to build a nest and the bee to seek a shelter that shall protect it from the inclemen∣cies of winter In those countries where the bees are wild and unprotected by man they are always sure to build their waxen cells in the hollow of a tree but with us they seem im∣provident  provident in their choice and the first green branch that stops their flight seems to be thought sufficient for their abode through win∣ter However it does not appear that the queen chuses the place where they are to alight for many of the stragglers who seem to be pleased with a particular branch go and settle upon it others are seen to succeed and at last the queen herself when she finds a sufficient number there before her goes to make it the place of her head quarters When the queen is settled the rest of the swarm soon follow and in about a quarter of an hour the whole body seem to be at ease It sometimes is found that there are two or three queens to a swarm and the colony is divided into parties but it most usually happens that one of these is more considerable than the other and the bees by degrees desert the weakest to take shelter under the most powerful protector The deserted queen does not long survive this defeat she takes refuge under the new monarch and is soon destroyed by her jealous rival Till this cruel execution is performed the bees never go out to work and if there should be a queen bee belonging to the new colony left in the old hive she always under∣goes the fate of the former However it must  be observed that the bees never sacrifice any of their queens when the hive is full of wax and honey for there is at that time no dan∣ger in maintaining a plurality of breeders  When the swarm is thus conducted to a place of rest and the policy of government is settled the bees soon resume their former la∣bours The making cells storing them with honey impregnating the queen making pro∣per cells for the reception of the rising progeny and protecting them from external danger employ their unceasing industry But soon after and towards the latter end of summer when the colony is sufficiently stored with in∣habitants a most cruel policy ensues The drone bees which are as has been said ge∣nerally in a hive to the number of an hundred are marked for slaughter These which had hitherto led a life of indolence and pleasure whose only employment was in impregnating the queen and rioting upon the labours of the hive without aiding in the general toil now share the fate of most voluptuaries and fall a sacrifice to the general resentment of society  The working bees in a body declare war against them and in two or three days time the ground all round the hive is covered with their dead bodies Nay the working bees  will even kill such drones as are yet in the worm state in the cell and eject their bodies from the hive among the general carnage  When a hive sends out several swarms in the year the first is always the best and the most numerous These having the whole summer before them have the more time for mak∣ing wax and honey and consequently their labours are the most valuable to the proprietor Although the swarm chiefly consists of the youngest bees yet it is often found that bees of all ages compose the multitude of emigrants and it often happens that bees of all ages are seen remaining behind The number of them is always more considerable than that of some populous cities for sometimes upwards of forty thousand are found in a single hive So large a body may well be supposed to work with great expedition and in fact in less than twentyfour hours they will make combs above twenty inches long and seven or eight broad Sometimes they will half fill their hives with wax in less than five days In the first fifteen days they are always found to make more wax than they do afterwards during the rest of the year  Such are the outlines of the natural history of these annimals as usually found in our own  country How they are treated so as to pro∣duce the greatest quantity of honey belongs rather to the rural oeconomist than the natural historian volumes have been written on the subject and still more remains equally curious and new One thing however it may be pro∣per to observe that a farm or a country may be over stocked with bees as with any other sort of animal for a certain number of hives always require a certain number of flowers to subsist on When the flowers near home are rifled then are these industrious insects seen tak∣ing more extensive ranges but their abilities may be over taxed and if they are obliged in quest of honey to go too far from home they are overwearied in the pursuit they are devour∣ed by birds or beat down by the winds and rain  For a knowledge of this in some parts of France and Piedmont they have contrived as I have often seen a kind of floating beehouse  They have on board one barge threescore or an hundred beehives well defended from the inclemency of an accidental storm and with these the owners suffer themselves to float gently down the river As the bees are con∣tinually chusing their flowery pasture along the banks of the stream they are furnished with sweets before unrifled and thus a single float∣ing  beehouse yields the proprietor a consider∣able income Why a method similar to this has never been adopted in England where we have more gentle rivers and more flowery banks than in any other part of the world I know not certainly it might be turned to ad∣vantage and yield the possessor a secure though perhaps a moderate income  Having mentioned the industry of these ad∣mirable insects it will be proper to say some∣thing of the effects of their labour of that wax and honey which are turned by man to such various uses Bees gather two kinds of wax one coarse and the other fine The coarser sort is bitter and with this which is called  propolis  they stop up all the holes and crevices of their hives It is of a more resinous nature than the fine wax and is consequently better qualified to resist the moisture of the season and preserve the works warm and dry within The fine wax is as necessary to the animals preservation as the honey itself With this they make their lodg∣ings with this they cover the cells of their young and in this they lay up their magazines of honey This is made as has been already observed from the dust of flowers which is carefully kneaded by the little insect then swallowed and having undergone a kind of di∣gestion  is formed into the cells which answers such a variety of purposes To collect this the animal rolls itself in the flower it would rob and thus takes up the vegetable dust with the hair of its body Then carefully brushing it into a lump with its fore paws it thrusts the composition into two cavities behind the thighs which are made like spoons to receive the wax and the hair that lines them serves to keep it from falling  As of wax there are also two kinds of honey The white and the yellow The white is taken without fire from the honeycombs The yellow is extracted by heat and squeezed through bags in a press The best honey is new thick and granulated of a clear transparent white colour of a soft and aromatic smell and of a sweet lively taste Honey made in moun∣tainous countries is preferable to that of the valley The honey made in the spring is more highly esteemed than that gathered in summer which last is still more valuable than that of autumn when the flowers begin to fade and lose their fragrance  The bees are nearly alike in all parts of the world yet there are differences worthy our notice In Guadaloupe the bee is less by one half than the European and more black and  round They have no sting and make their cells in hollow trees where if the hole they meet with is too large they form a sort of waxen house of the shape of a pear and in this they lodge and store their honey and lay their eggs They lay up their honey in waxen vessels of the size of a pigeon's egg of a black or deep violet colour and these are so joined to∣gether that there is no space left between them The honey never congeals but is fluid of the consistence of oil and the colour of amber Resembling these there are found little black bees without a sting in all the tropical cli∣mates and though these countries are replete with bees like our own yet those form the most useful and laborious tribe in that part of the world The honey they produce is neither so unpalatable nor so surfeiting as ours and the wax is so soft that it is only used for medi∣cinal purposes it being never found hard enough to form into candles as in Europe  Of insects that receive the name of bees among us there are several which however differ very widely from that industrious social race we have been just describing The HUM∣BLE BEE is the largest of all this tribe being as large as the first joint of one's middle finger These are seen in every field and perched on  every flower They build their nest in holes in the ground of dry leaves mixed with wax and wool defended with moss from the weather Each humble bee makes a separate cell about the size of a small nutmeg which is round and hollow containing the honey in a bag Se∣veral of these cells are joined together in such a manner that the whole appears like a cluster of grapes The females which have the ap∣pearance of wasps are very few and their eggs are laid in cells which the rest soon cover over with wax It is uncertain whether they have a queen or not but there is one much larger than the rest without wings and with∣out hair and all over black like polished ebony This goes and views all the works from time to time and enters into the cell as if it wanted to see whether every thing was done right In the morning the young humble bees are very idle and seem not at all inclined to labour till one of the largest about seven o'clock thrusts half its body from a hole designed for that purpose and seated on the top of the nest beats its wings for twenty minutes successively buzzing the whole time till the whole colony is put in motion The humble bees gather honey as well as the com∣mon  bees but it is neither so fine nor so good nor the wax so clean or so capable of fusion  Besides the bees already mentioned there are various kinds among us that have much the appearance of honeymakers and yet make only wax The WOOD BEE is seen in every garden It is rather larger than the common queen bee its body of a blueish black which is smooth and shining It begins to appear at the ap∣proach of spring and is seen flying near walls exposed to a sunny aspect This bee makes its nest in some piece of wood which it contrives to scoop and hollow for its purpose This however is never done in trees that are stand∣ing for the wood it makes choice of is half rotten The holes are not made directly for∣ward but turning to one side and have an opening sufficient to admit one's middle finger from whence runs the inner apartment gene∣rally twelve or fifteen inches long The instru∣ments used in boring these cavities are their teeth the cavity is usually branched into three or four apartments and in each of these they lay their eggs to the number of ten or twelve each separate and distinct from the rest The egg is involved in a sort of paste which serves at once for the young animal's protection  and nourishment The grown bees however feed upon small insects particularly a louse of a reddish brown colour of the size of a small pin's head  MASON BEES make their cells with a sort of mortar made of earth which they build against a wall that is exposed to the sun The mortar which at first is soft soon becomes as hard as stone and in this their eggs are laid Each nest contains seven or eight cells an egg in every cell placed regularly one over the other If the nest remains unhurt or wants but little repairs they make use of them the year ensuing and thus they often serve three or four years successively From the strength of their houses one would think these bees in perfect security yet none are more exposed than they A worm with very strong teeth is often found to bore into their little fortifica∣tions and devour their young  The GROUND BEE builds its nest in the earth wherein they make round holes five or six inches deep the mouth being narrow and only just sufficient to admit the little inhabi∣tant It is amusing enough to observe the patience and assiduity with which they labour They carry out all the earth grain by grain to the mouth of the hole where it forms a little  hillock an Alps compared to the power of the artist by which it is raised Sometimes the walks of a garden are found undermined by their labours some of the holes running directly downward others horizontally be∣neath the surface They lay up in these ca∣vities provisions for their young which consist of a paste that has the appearance of corn and is of a sweetish taste  The LEAFCUTTING BEES make their nest and lay their eggs among bits of leaves very artificially placed in holes in the earth of about the length of a toothpick case They make the bits of leaves of a roundish form and with them line the inside of their habita∣tions This tapestry is still further lined by a reddish kind of paste somewhat sweet or acid These bees are of various kinds those that build their nests with chesnutleaves are as big as drones but those of the rosetree are smaller than the common bee  The WALL BEES are so called because they make their nests in walls of a kind of silky membrane with which they fill up the vacuities between the small stones which form the sides of their habitation Their apartment consists of several cells placed end to end each in the shape of a woman's thimble Though the  web which lines this habitation is thick and warm yet it is transparent and of a whitish colour This substance is supposed to be spun from the animal's body the male and females are of a size but the former are without a sting To these varieties of the bee kind might be added several others which are all different in nature but not sufficiently distinguished to excite curiosity  CHAP III Of the Wasp and Hornet  HOWEVER similar many insects may be in appearance this does not imply a similitude in their history The bee and the wasp re∣semble each other very strongly yet in ex∣amining their manner and their duration they differ very widely the bee labours to lay up honey and lives to enjoy the fruits of its indu∣stry the wasp appears equally assiduous but only works for posterity as the habitation is scarcely completed when the inhabitant dies  The wasp is well known to be a winged in∣sect with a sting To be longer in proportion to its bulk than the bee to be marked with bright yellow circles round its body and to be the most swift and active insect of all the fly kind On each side of the mouth this animal is furnished with a long tooth notched like a saw and with these it is enabled to cut any substance not omitting meat itself and to carry it to its nest Wasps live like bees in community and sometimes ten or twelve thousand are found inhabiting a single nest  Of all other insects the wasp is the most fierce voracious and most dangerous when enraged They are seen wherever flesh is cutting up gorging themselves with the spoil and then flying to their nests with their reeking prey They make war also on every other fly and the spider himself dreads their ap∣proaches  Every community among bees is composed of females or queens drones or males and neutral or working bees Wasps have similar occupations the two first are for propagating the species the last for nursing defending and supporting the rising progeny Among bees however there is seldom above a queen or two in an hive among wasps there are above two or three hundred  As soon as the summer begins to invigorate the insect tribes the wasps are the most of the number and diligently employed either in providing provisions for their nest if already made or in making one if the former habi∣tation be too small to receive the encreasing community The nest is one of the most cu∣rious objects in natural history and contrived almost as artificially as that of the bees them∣selves Their principal care is to seek out an hole that has been begun by some other ani∣mal  a field mouse a rat or a mole to build their nests in They sometimes build upon the plain where they are sure of the dryness of their situation but most commonly on the side of a bank to avoid the rain or water that would otherwise annoy them When they have chosen a proper place they go to work with wonderful assiduity Their first labour is to enlarge and widen the hole taking away the earth and carrying it off to some distance They are perfectly formed for labour being furnished with a trunk above their mouths two saws on each side which play to the right and left against each other and six strong muscu∣lar legs to support them They cut the earth into small parcels with their saws and carry it out with their legs or paws This is the work of some days and at length the outline of their habitation is formed making a cavity of about a foot and an half every way While some are working in this manner others are roving the fields to seek out materials for their building To prevent the earth from falling down and crushing their rising city into ruin they make a sort of roof with their gluey substance to which they begin to fix the ru∣diments of their building working from the top downwards as if they were hanging a  bell which however at length they close up at the bottom The materials with which they build their nests are bits of wood and glue The wood they get where they can from the rails and posts which they meet with in the fields and elsewhere These they saw and di∣vide into a multitude of small fibres of which they take up little bundles in their claws letting fall upon them a few drops of gluey matter with which their bodies are provided by the help of which they knead the whole composition into a paste which serves them in their future building When they have returned with this to the nest they stick their load of paste on that part where they make their walls and par∣titions they tread it close with their feet and trowel it with their trunks still going back∣wards as they work Having repeated this ope∣ration three or four times the composition is at length flatted out until it becomes a small leaf of a grey colour much finer than paper and of a pretty firm texture This done the same wasp returns to the field to collect a second load of paste repeating the same several times placing layer upon layer and strengthening eve∣ry partition in proportion to the wants or con∣veniencies of the general fabric Other work∣ing wasps come quickly after to repeat the same  operation laying more leaves upon the former till at length after much toil they have finish∣ed the large roof which is to secure them from the tumbling in of the earth This dome be∣ing finished they make another entrance to their habitation designed either for letting in the warmth of the sun or for escaping in case one door be invaded by plunderers Cer∣tain however it is that by one of these they al∣ways enter by the other they sally forth to their toil each hole being so small that they can pass but one at a time The walls being thus composed and the whole somewhat of the shape of a pear they labour at their cells which they compose of the same paperlike substance that goes to the formation of their outside works Their combs differ from those of bees not less in the composition than the position which they are always seen to obtain The honeycomb of the bee is edgeways with respect to the hive that of the wasp is flat and the mouth of every cell opens downwards Thus is their habitation contrived story above story supported by several rows of pillars which give firmness to the whole building while the upper story is flatroofed and as smooth as the pave∣ment of a room laid with squares of marble The wasps can freely walk upon these stories  between the pillars to do whatever their wants require The pillars are very hard and com∣pact being larger at each end than in the middle not much unlike the columns of a building All the cells of the nest are only de∣stined for the reception of the young being replete with neither wax nor honey  Each cell is like that of the bee hexagonal but they are of two sorts the one larger for the production of the male and female wasps the other less for the reception of the working part of the community When the females are im∣pregnated by the males they lay their eggs one in each cell and stick it in with a kind of gummy matter to prevent its falling out From this egg proceeds the insect in its wormstate of which the old ones are extremely careful feeding it from time to time till it becomes large and entirely fills up its cell But the wasp community differs from that of the bee in this that among the latter the working bees take the parental duties upon them whereas among the wasps the females alone are permitted to feed their young and to nurse their rising pro∣geny For this purpose the female waits with great patience till the working wasps have brought in their provisions which she takes from them and cuts into pieces She then goes  with great composure from cell to cell and feeds every young one with her mouth When the young worms have come to a certain size they leave off eating and begin to spin a very fine silk fixing the first end to the entrance of the cell then turning their heads first on one side then on the other they fix the thread to different parts and thus they make a sort of a door which serves to close up the mouth of the cell After this they divest themselves of their skins after the usual mode of transforma∣tion the aurelia by degrees begins to emanci∣pate itself from its shell by little and little it thrusts out its legs and wings and insensibly acquires the colour and shape of its parent  The wasp thus formed and prepared for de∣predation becomes a bold troublesome and dangerous insect there are no dangers which it will not encounter in pursuit of its prey and nothing seems to satiate its gluttony Though it can gather no honey of its own no animal is more fond of sweets For this purpose it will pursue the bee and the humble bee de∣stroy them with its sting and then plunder them of their honeybag with which it flies triumphantly loaded to its nest to regale its young Wasps are ever fond of making their nests in the neighbourhood of bees merely to  have an opportunity of robbing their hives and feasting on the spoil Yet the bees are not found always patiently submissive to their ty∣ranny but fierce battles are sometimes seen to ensue in which the bees make up by conduct and numbers what they want in personal prow∣ess When there is no honey to be had they seek for the best and sweetest fruits and they are never mistaken in their choice From the garden they fly to the city to the grocers shops and butchers shambles They will sometimes carry off bits of flesh half as big as themselves with which they fly to their nests for the nourishment of their brood Those who cannot drive them away lay for them a piece of ox's liver which being without fibres they prefer to other flesh and whenever they are found all other flies are seen to desert the place immediately Such is the dread with which these little animals impress all the rest of the insect tribes which they seize and devour without mercy that they vanish at their ap∣proach Wherever they fly like the eagle or the falcon they form a desert in the air around them In this manner the summer is passed in plundering the neighbourhood and rearing up their young every day adds to their numbers and from their strength agility and indiscriminate appetite for every kind of pro∣vision  were they as long lived as the bee they would soon swarm upon the face of nature and become the most noxious plague of man but providentially their lives are measured to their mischief and they live but a single sea∣son  While the summer heats continue they are bold voracious and enterprizing but as the sun withdraws it seems to rob them of their courage and activity In proportion as the cold encreases they are seen to become more do∣mestic they seldom leave the nest they make but short adventures from home they flutter about in the noonday heats and soon after return chilled and feeble  As their calamities encrease new passions soon begin to take place the care for poste∣rity no longer continues and as the parents are no longer able to provide their grow∣ing progeny a supply they take the barba∣rous resolution of sacrificing them all to the necessity of the times In this manner like a garrison upon short allowance all the useless hands are destroyed the young worms which a little before they fed and protected with so much assiduity are now butchered and dragged fr  m their cells As the cold encreases they no longer find sufficient warmth in their nests which grow hateful to them and they fly to  seek it in the corners of houses and places that receive an artificial heat But the winter is still insupportable and before the new year begins they wither and die the working bees first the males soon following and many of the fe∣males suffering in the general calamity In every nest however one or two females survive the winter and having been impregnated by the male during the preceding season she begins in spring to lay her eggs in a little hole of her own contrivance This bundle of eggs which is clustered together like grapes soon produces two worms which the female takes proper pre∣caution to defend and supply and these when hatched soon give assistance to the female who is employed in hatching two more these also gathering strength extricate themselves out of the web that enclosed them and become likewise assistants to their mother fifteen days after two more make their appearance thus is the community every day encreasing while the female lays in every cell first a male and then a female These soon after become breed∣ers in turn till from a single female ten thou∣sand wasps are seen produced before the month of June After the female has thus produ∣ced her progeny which are distributed in dif∣ferent districts they assemble from all parts  in the middle of summer and provide for themselves the large and commodious habita∣tion which has been described above  Such is the history of the social wasp but as among bees so also among these insects there are various tribes that live in solitude these lay their eggs in a hole for the purpose and the parent dies long before the birth of its offspring In the principal species of the SOLITARY WASPS the insect is smaller than the working wasp of the social kind The fila∣ment by which the corselet is joined to the body is longer and more distinctly seen and the whole colour of the insect is blacker than in the ordinary kinds But it is not their figure but the manners of this extraordinary insect that claim our principal regard  From the end of May to the beginning of July this wasp is seen most diligently em∣ployed The whole purpose of its life seems to be in contriving and fitting up a commodious apartment for its young one which is not to succeed it till the year ensuing For this end it is employed with unwearied assiduity in boring a hole into the finest earth some inches deep but not much wider than the diameter of its own body This is but a gallery lead∣ing to a wider apartment destined for the con∣venient  lodgment of its young As it always chuses a gravelly soil to work in and where the earth is almost as hard as stone itself the digging and hollowing this apartment is an enterprize of no small labour for effecting its operations this insect is furnished with two teeth which are strong and firm but not sufficiently hard to penetrate the substance through which it is resolved to make its way In order therefore to soften that earth which it is unable to pierce it is furnished with a gummy liquor which it emits upon the place and which renders it more easily separable from the rest and the whole becoming a kind of soft paste is removed to the mouth of the habi∣tation The animal's provision of liquor in these operations is however soon exhausted and it is then seen either taking up water from some neighbouring flower or stream in order to supply the deficiency  At length after much toil a hole some inches deep is formed at the bottom of which is a large cavity and to this no other hostile insect would venture to find its way from the length and the narrowness of the defile through which it would be obliged to pass In this the solitary wasp lays its egg which is destined to continue the species there the nascent animal  is to continue for above nine months unattend∣ed and immured and at first appearance the most helpless insect of the creation But when we come to examine new wonders offer no other insect can boast so copiously luxurious a provision or such confirmed security  As soon as the mother wasp has deposited her egg at the bottom of the hole her next care is to furnish it with a supply of provisions which may be offered to the young insect as soon as it leaves the egg To this end she procures a number of little green worms generally from eight to twelve and these are to serve as food for the young one the instant it awakens into life When this supply is regularly arranged and laid in the old one then with as much assiduity as it before worked out its hole now closes the mouth of the passage and thus leaving its young one immured in perfect se∣curity and in a copious supply of animal food she dies satisfied with having provided for a future progeny  When the young one leaves the egg it is scarcely visible and is seen immured among a number of insects infinitely larger than itself ranged in proper order around it which how∣ever give it no manner of apprehension Whe∣ther the parent when she laid in the insect  provision contrived to disable the worms from resistance or whether they were at first incapa∣ble of any is not known Certain it is that the young glutton feasts upon the living spoil without any controul his game lies at his hand and he devours one after the other as the calls of appetite incite him The life of the young animal is therefore spent in the most luxurious manner till its whole stock of worms is exhausted and then the time of its transfor∣mation begins to approach and then spinning a silken web it continues fixed in its cell till the sun calls it from its dark abode the ensuing summer  The wasps of Europe are very mischievous yet they are innocence itself when compared to those of the tropical climates where all the insect tribes are not only numerous but large voracious and formidable Those of the West Indies are thicker and twice as long as the common bee they are of a grey colour striped with yellow and armed with a very dangerous sting They make their cells in the manner of a honeycomb in which the young ones are hatched and bred They generally hang their nests by threads composed of the same substance with the cells to the branches of trees and the eaves of houses They are  seen every where in great abundance de∣scending like fruit particularly pears of which shape they are and as large as one's head The inside is divided into three round stories full of cells each hexagonal like those of an honeycomb In some of the islands these insects are so very numerous that their nests are stuck up in this manner scarce two feet asunder and the inhabitants are in con∣tinual apprehension from their accidental re∣sentment It sometimes happens that no pre∣cautions can prevent their attacks and the pains of their sting is almost insupportable Those who have felt it think it more terrible than even that of a scorpion the whole visage swells and the features are so disfigured that a person is scarcely known by his most intimate acquaintance  CHAP IV Of the Ichnumon Fly  EVERY rank of insects how voracious soever have enemies that are terrible to them and that revenge upon them the injuries done upon the rest of the animated creation The wasp as we have seen is very troublesome to man and very formidable to the insect tribe but the ichnumon fly of which there are many varieties fears not the wasp itself it enters its retreats plunders its habitations and takes possession of that cell for its own young which the wasp had laboriously built for a dearer posterity  Though there are many different kinds of this insect yet the most formidable and that best known is called the common ichnumon with four wings like the bee a long slender black body and a three forked tail consisting of bristles the two outermost black and the middlemost red This fly receives its name from the little quadrupede which is found to be so destructive to the crocodile as it bears a strong similitude in its courage and rapacity  Though this instrument is to all appearance slender and feeble yet it is found to be a wea∣pon of great force and efficacy There is scarce any substance which it will not pierce and indeed it is seldom seen but employed in pe∣netration This is the weapon of defence this is employed in destroying its prey and still more by this the animal deposites her eggs where∣ever she thinks fit to lay them As it is an instrument chiefly employed for this purpose the male is unprovided with such a sting while the female uses it with great force and dexterity brandishing it when caught from side to side and very often wounding those who thought they held her with the greatest security  All the flies of this tribe are produced in the same manner and owe their birth to the de∣struction of some other insect within whose body they have been deposed and upon whose vitals they have preyed till they came to ma∣turity There is no insect whatever which they will not attack in order to leave their fatal present in its body the caterpillar the gnat and even the spider himself so formid∣able to others is often made the unwilling fosterer of this destructive progeny  About the middle of summer when other insects are found in great abundance the ich∣numon  is seen flying busily about and seeking proper objects upon whom to depose its pro∣geny As there are various kinds of this fly so they seem to have various appetites Some are found to place their eggs within the aurelia of some nascent insect others place them within the nest which the wasp had curiously contrived for its own young and as both are produced at the same time the young of the ichnumon not only devours the young wasp but the whole supply of worms which the parent had carefully provided for its provision But the greatest number of the ichnumon tribe are seen settling upon the back of the caterpillar and darting at different intervals their stings into its body At every dart they depose an egg while the wounded animal seems scarcely sensi∣ble of the injury it sustains In this manner they leave from six to a dozen of their eggs within the fatty substance of the reptile's body and then fly off to commit further depredations In the mean time the caterpillar thus irreparably injured seems to feed as voraciously as before does not abate of its usual activity and to all appearance seems no way affected by the in∣ternal enemies that are preparing its destruction in their darksome abode But they soon burst from their egg state and begin to prey upon  the substance of their prison As they grow larger they require a greater supply till at last the animal by whose vitals they are sup∣ported is no longer able to sustain them but dies its whole inside being almost eaten away It often happens however that it survives their worm state and then they change into a chrysalis enclosed in the caterpillar's body till the time of their delivery approaches when they burst their prisons and fly away The caterpillar however is irreparably destroyed it never changes into a chrysalis but dies shortly after from the injuries it had sustained  Such is the history of this fly which though very terrible to the insect tribe fails not to be of infinite service to mankind The millions which it kills in a single summer are uncon∣ceiveable and without such a destroyer the fruits of the earth would only rise to furnish a banquet for the insect race to the exclusion of all the nobler ranks of animated nature  CHAP V Of the Ant  THOUGH the number of two winged flies be very great and the naturalists have taken some pains to describe their characters and varieties yet there is such a similitude in their forms and manners that in a work like this one description must serve for all We now therefore come to a species of four winged insects that are famous from all antiquity for their social and industrious habits that are marked for their spirit of subordination that are offered as a pattern of parsimony to the profuse and of unremitting diligence to the sluggard  In the experiments however which have been more recently made and the observations which have been taken much of their boasted frugality and precaution seems denied them the treasures they lay up are no longer sup∣posed intended for future provision and the choice they make in their stores seems no way dictated by wisdom It is indeed somewhat surprizing that almost every writer of antiqui∣ty should describe this insect as labouring in the summer and feasting upon the produce  during the winter Perhaps in some of the warmer climates where the winter is mild and of short contiuance this may take place but in France and England these animals can have no manner of occasion for a supply of winter provisions as they are actually in a state of torpidity during that season  The common ants of Europe are of two or three different kinds some red some black some with stings and others without Such as have stings inflict their wounds in that manner such as are unprovided with these weapons of defence have a power of spurting from their hinder parts an acid pungent liquor which if it lights upon the skin inflames and burns it like nettles  The body of an ant is divided into the head breast and belly In the head the eyes are placed which are entirely black and under the eyes there are two small horns or feelers composed of twelve joints all covered with a fine silky hair The mouth is furnished with two crooked jaws which project outwards in each of which are seen incisures that look like teeth The breast is covered with a fine silky hair from which project six legs that are pretty strong and hairy the extremities of each armed with two small claws which the animal uses in  climbing The belly is more reddish than the rest of the body which is of a brown chesnut colour it is as shining as glass and covered with extremely fine hair  From such a formation this animal seems bolder and more active for its size than any other of the insect tribe and fears not to attack a creature often above ten times its own mag∣nitude  As soon as the winter is past in the first fine day in April the ant hill that before seemed a desart now swarms with new life and myriads of these insects are seen just awaked from their annual lethargy and preparing for the pleasures and fatigues of the season For the first day they never offer to leave the hill which may be considered as their citadel but run over every part of it as if to examine its present situation to observe what injuries it has sustained during the rigours of winter  Memoires pour servoir a l' Histoire des insectes par Charles de Geer  while they slept and to mediate and settle the labours of the day ensuing  At the first display of their forces none but the wingless tribe appears while those furnish∣ed with wings remain at the bottom These are the working ants that first appear and that  are always destitute of wings the males and females that are furnished with four large wings each are more slow in making their ap∣pearance  Thus like bees they are divided into males females and the neutral or the working tribe These are all easily distinguished from each other the females are much larger than the males the working ants are the smallest of all The two former have wings which however they sometimes are divested of the latter never have any and upon them are devolved all the labours that tend to the welfare of the commu∣nity The female also may be distinguished by the colour and structure of her breast which is a little more brown than that of the common ant and a little brighter than that of the male  In eight or ten days after their first appear∣ance the labours of the hill are in some for∣wardness the males and females are seen mix∣ed with the working multitude and pursued or pursuing each other They seem no way to partake in the common drugeries of the state the males pursue the females with great assiduity and in a manner force them to compliance They remain coupled for some time while the males thus united suffer themselves to be drawn along by the will of their partners  In the mean time the working body of the state take no part in their pleasures they are seen diligently going from the anthill in pursuit of food for themselves and their asso∣ciates and of proper materials for giving a comfortable retreat to their young or safety to their habitation In the fields of England anthills are formed with but little apparent regularity In the more southern provinces of Europe they are constructed with wonderful contrivance and offer a sight highly worthy a naturalist's curiosity These are generally formed in the neighbourhood of some large tree and a stream of water The one is con∣sidered by the animals as the proper place for getting food the other for supplying them with moisture which they cannot well dispense with The shape of the anthill is that of a sugar loaf about three feet high composed of various substances leaves bits of wood sand earth bits of gum and grains of corn These are all united into a compact body perforated with galleries down to the bottom and wind∣ing ways within the body of the structure From this retreat to the water as well as to the tree in different directions there are many paths worn by constant assiduity and along these the busy insects are seen passing and re∣passing  continually so that from May or the beginning of June according to the state of the season they work continually till the bad weather comes on  The chief employment of the working ants is in sustaining not only the idlers at home but also finding a sufficiency of food for them∣selves They live upon various provisions as well of the vegetable as of the animal kind Small insects they will kill and devour sweets of all kinds they are particularly fond of They seldom however think of their com∣munity till they themselves are first satiated Having found a juicy fruit they swallow what they can and then tearing it in pieces carry home their load If they meet with an insect above their match several of them will fall upon it at once and having mangled it each will carry off a part of the spoil If they meet in their excursions any thing that is too heavy for one to bear and yet which they are unable to divide several of them will endeavour to force it along some dragging and others push∣ing If any one of them happens to make a lucky discovery it will immediately give ad∣vice to others and then at once the whole republic will put themselves in motion If in these struggles one of them happens to be  killed some kind survivor will carry him off to a great distance to prevent the obstructions his body may give to the general spirit of industry  But while they are thus employed in support∣ing the state in feeding abroad and carrying in provisions to those that continue at home they are not unmindful of posterity After a few days of fine weather the female ants begin to lay their eggs and those are as assidu∣ously watched and protected by the working ants who take upon themselves to supply whatever is wanting to the nascent animal's convenience or necessity They are carried as soon as laid to the safest situation at the bot∣tom of their hill where they are carefully de∣fended from cold and moisture We are not to suppose that those white substances which we so plentifully find in every anthill are the eggs as newly laid On the contrary the ant's egg is so very small that though laid upon a black ground it can scarcely be discerned The little white bodies we see are the young animals in their maggot state endued with life long since freed from the egg and often in∣volved in a cone which it has spun round it∣self like the silk worm The real egg when laid if viewed through a microscope appears smooth polished and shining while the mag∣got  is seen composed of twelve rings and is oftener larger than the ant itself  It is impossible to express the fond attach∣ment which the working ants shew to their rising progeny In cold weather they take them in their mouths but without offering them the smallest injury to the very depths of their ha∣bitation where they are less subject to the severity of the season In a fine day they re∣move them with the same care nearer the sur∣face where their maturity may be assisted by the warm beams of the sun If a formidable enemy should come to batter down their whole habitation and crush them by thousands in the ruin yet these wonderful insects still mindful of their parental duties make it their first care to save their offspring They are seen running wildly about and different ways each loaded with a young one often bigger than the insect that supports it I have kept says Swammer∣dam several of the working ants in my closet with their young in a glass filled with earth I took pleasure in observing that in proportion as the earth dried on the surface they dug deeper and deeper to deposite their eggs and when I poured water thereon it was surprising to see with what care affection and diligence they laboured to put their brood in safety in  the driest place I have seen also that when water has been wanting for several days and when the earth was moistened after it a little they immediately carried their young ones to have a share who seemed to enjoy and suck the moisture  When the young maggot is come to its full growth the breast swells insensibly it casts its skin and loses all motion All the members which were hidden before then begin to appear an aurelia is formed which represents very distinctly all the parts of the animal though they are yet without mo∣tion and as it were wrapped up in swaddlingcloaths When at length the little insect has passed through all its changes and acquired its proper maturity it bursts this last skin to as∣sume the form it is to retain ever after Yet this is not done by the efforts of the little ani∣mal alone for the old ones very assiduously break open with their teeth the covering in which it is enclosed Without this assistance the aurelia would never be able to get free as Mr De Geer often found who tried the expe∣riment by leaving the aurelia to themselves The old ones not only assist them but know the very precise time for lending their assistance for if produced too soon the young one dies of  cold if retarded too long it is suffocated in its prison  When the female has done laying and the whole brood is thus produced her labours as well as that of the male become unnecessary and her wings which she had but a short time before so actively employed drop off What becomes of her when thus divested of her orna∣ments is not well known for she is seen in the cells for some weeks after The males on the other hand having no longer any occupation at home make use of those wings with which they have been furnished by nature and fly away never to return or to be heard of more It is probable they perish with the cold or are de∣voured by the birds which are particularly fond of this petty prey  In the mean time the working ants having probably deposed their queens and being de∣serted by the males that served but to clog the community prepare for the severity of the win∣ter and bury their retreats as deep in the earth as they conveniently can It is now found that the grains of corn and other substances with which they furnish their hill are only meant as fences to keep off the rigours of the weather not as provisions to support them during its con∣tinuance It is found generally to obtain that  every insect that lives a year after it is come to its full growth is obliged to pass four or five months without taking any nourishment and will seem to be dead all that time It would be to no purpose therefore for ants to lay up corn for the winter since they lie that time without motion heaped upon each other and are so far from eating that they are utterly unable to stir Thus what authors have dignified by the name of a magazine appears to be no more than a cavity which serves for a common re∣treat when the weather forces them to return to their lethargic state  What has been said with exaggeration of the European ant is however true if asserted of those of the tropical climates They build an anthill with great contrivance and regularity they lay up provisions and as they probably live the whole year they submit themselves to regulations entirely unknown among the ants of Europe  Those of Africa are of three kinds the red the green and the black the latter are above an inch long and in every respect a most for∣midable insect Their sting produces extreme pain and their depredations are sometimes ex∣tremely destructive They build an anthill of a very great size from six to twelve feet high  it is made of viscous clay and tapers into a py∣ramidal form This habitation is constructed with great artifice and the cells are so nume∣rous and even that a honeycomb scarce ex∣ceeds them in number and regularity  The inhabitants of this edifice seem to be un∣der a very strict regulation At the slightest warning they will sally out upon whatever dis∣turbs them and if they have time to arrest their enemies he is sure to find no mercy Sheep hens and even rats are often destroyed by these merciless insects and their flesh devoured to the bone No anatomist in the world can strip a skeleton so cleanly as they and no animal how strong soever when they have once seized upon it has power to resist them  It often happens that these insects quit their retreat in a body and go in quest of adventures  "During my stay" says Smith "at Cape Corse Castle a body of these ants came to pay us a visit in our fortification It was about daybreak when the advanced guard of this famished crew entered the chapel where some negroe servants were asleep upon the floor The men were quickly alarmed at the invasion of this unexpected army and prepared as well as they could for a de∣fence While the foremost battalion of in∣sects  had already taken possession of the place the rear guard was more than a quarter of a mile distant The whole ground seemed alive and crawling with unceasing destruc∣tion After deliberating a few moments up∣on what was to be done it was resolved to lay a large train of gunpowder along the path they had taken by this means millions were blown to pieces and the rear guard peceiv∣ing the destruction of their leaders thought proper instantly to return and make back to their original habitation"  The order which these ants observe seems very extraordinary whenever they sally forth fifty or sixty larger than the rest are seen to head the band and conduct them to their destined prey If they have a fixed spot where their prey continues to resort to they then form a vaulted gallery which is sometimes a quarter of a mile in length and yet they will hollow it out in the space of ten or twelve hours  CHAP VI Of the Beetle and its Varieties  HITHERTO we have been treating of in∣sects with four transparent wings we now come to a tribe with two transparent wings with cases that cover them close while at rest but which allow them their proper play when fly∣ing The principal of these are the Beetle the May Bug and the Cantharis These are all bred like the rest of their order first from eggs then they become grubs then a chrysalis in which the parts of the future fly are distinctly seen and lastly the animal leaves its prison breaking forth as a winged animal in full ma∣turity  Of the Beetle there are various kinds all however concurring in one common formation of having cases to their wings which are the more necessary to those insects as they often live under the surface of the earth in holes which they dig out by their own industry These cases prevent the various injuries their real wings might sustain by rubbing or crushing against the sides of their abode These though  depiction of some types of beetles  Beetles  E Martin sculp  they do not assist flight yet keep the internal wings clean and even and produce a loud buzzing noise when the animal rises in the air  If we examine the formation of all animals of the beetle kind we shall find as in shellfish that their bones are placed externally and their muscles within These muscles are formed very much like those of quadrupedes and are endued with such surprizing strength that bulk for bulk they are a thousand times stronger than those of a man The strength of these muscles is of use in digging the animal's subterraneous abode where it is most usually hatched and to which it most frequently re∣turns even after it becomes a winged insect capable of flying  Beside the difference which results from the shape and colour of these animals the size also makes a considerable one some beetles being not larger than the head of a pin while others such as the elephant beetle are as big as ones fist But the greatest difference among them is that some are produced in a month and in a single season go through all the stages of their existence while others take near four years to their production and live as winged insects a year more To give the history of all these  animals that are bred pretty much in the same way would be insipid and endless it will suffice to select one or two from the number the origin of which may serve as specimens of the rest I will therefore offer the history of the maybug to the reader's attention pre∣mising that most other beetles though not so long lived are bred in the same manner  The maybug or dorrbeetle as some call it has like all the rest a pair of cases to its wings which are of a reddish brown colour sprinkled with a whitish dust which easily comes off In some years their necks are seen covered with a red plate and in others with a black these however are distinct sorts and their difference is by no means accidental The fore legs are very short and the better calculated for burrowing in the ground where this insect makes its retreat It is well known for its evening buzz to children but till more formidably introduced to the acquaintance of husbandmen and gardeners for in some seasons it has been found to swarm in such numbers as to eat up every vegetable production  The two sexes in the maybug are easily distinguished from each other by the superior length of the tufts at the end of the horns in  the male They begin to copulate in summer and at that season they are seen joined together for a considerable time The female being im∣pregnated quickly falls to boring a hole into the ground where to deposit her burthen This is generally about half a foot deep and in it the places her eggs which are of an oblong shape with great regularity one by the other They are of a bright yellow colour and no way wrapped up in a common covering as some have imagined When the female is lightened of her burthen she again ascends from her hole to live as before upon leaves and ve∣getables to buzz in the summer evening and to lie hid among the branches of trees in the heat of the day  In about three months after these eggs have been thus deposited in the earth the contain∣ed insect begins to break its shell and a small grub or maggot crawls forth and feeds upon the roots of whatever vegetable it happens to be nearest All substances of this kind seem equally grateful yet it is probable the mother insect has a choice among what kind of veget∣ables she shall deposit her young In this manner these voracious creatures continue in the worm state for more than three years devouring the roots of every plant they ap∣proach  and making their way under ground in quest of food with great dispatch and facility At length they grow to above the size of a walnut being a great thick white maggot with a red head which is seen most frequently in new turned earth and which is so eagerly sought after by birds of every species When largest they are found an inch and an half long of a whitish yellow colour with a body consisting of twelve seg∣ments or joints on each side of which there are nine breathing holes and three red feet The head is large in proportion to the body of a reddish colour with a pincer before and a semicircular lip with which it cuts the roots of plants and sucks out their moisture As this insect lives entirely under ground it has no occasion for eyes and accordingly it is found to have none but is furnished with two feelers which like the crutch of a blind man serve to direct its motions Such is the form of this animal that lives for years in the worm state under ground still voracious and every year changing its skin  It is not till the end of the fourth year that this extraordinary insect prepares to emerge from its subterraneous abode and even this is not effected but by a tedious preparation  About the latter end of autumn the grub be∣gins to perceive the approaches of its transfor∣mation it then buries itself deeper and deeper in the earth sometimes six feet beneath the surface and there forms itself a capacious apartment the walls of which it renders very smooth and shining by the excretions of its body Its abode being thus formed it begins soon after to shorten itself to swell and to burst its last skin in order to assume the form of a chrysalis This in the beginning appears of a yellowish colour which heightens by de∣grees till at last it is seen nearly red Its exterior form plainly discovers all the vestiges of the future winged insect all the fore parts being distinctly seen while behind the animal seems as if wrapped in swaddling cloaths  The young maybug continues in this state for about three months longer and it is not till the beginning of January that the aurelia divests itself of all its impediments and be∣comes a winged insect completely formed Yet still the animal is far from attaining its natural strength health and appetite It un∣dergoes a kind of infant imbecillity and unlike most other insects that the instant they become flies are arrived at their state of full perfection the maybug continues feeble and sickly  Its colour is much brighter than in the perfect animal all its parts are soft and its voracious nature seems for a while to have entirely for∣saken it As the animal is very often found in this state it is supposed by those unacquainted with its real history that the old ones of the former season have buried themselves for the winter in order to revisit the sun the ensuing summer But the fact is the old one never survives the season but dies like all the other winged tribe of insects from the severity of cold in winter  About the latter end of May these insects after having lived for four years under ground burst from the earth when the first mild even∣ing invites them abroad They are at that time seen rising from their long imprisonment from living only upon roots and imbibing only the moisture of the earth to visit the mildness of the summer air to chuse the sweetest vegetables for their banquet and to drink the dew of the evening Wherever an attentive observer then walks abroad he will see them bursting up before him in his pathway like ghosts on a theatre He will see every part of the earth that had its surface beaten into hardness per∣forated by their egression When the season is favourable for them they are seen by myriads  buzzing along hitting against every object that intercepts their flight The midday sun how∣ever seems too powerful for their constitu∣tions they then lurk under the leaves and branches of some shady tree but the willow seems particularly their most favourite food there they lurk in clusters and seldom quit the tree till they have devoured all its ver∣dure In those seasons which are favourable to their propagation they are seen in an even∣ing as thick as flakes of snow and hitting against every object with a sort of capricious blindness Their duration however is but short as they never survive the season They begin to join shortly after they have been let loose from their prison and when the female is impregnated the cautiously bores a hole in the ground with an instrument fitted for that purpose which the is furnished with at the tail and there deposits her eggs generally to the number of threescore If the season and the soil be adapted to their propagation these soon multiply as already described and go through their noxious stages of their contemp∣tible existence This insect however in its worm state though prejudicial to man makes one of the chief repasts of the feathered tribe and is generally the first nourishment with  which they supply their young Rooks and hogs are particularly fond of these worms and de∣vour them in great numbers The inhabitants of the county of Norfolk some time since went into the practice of destroying their rookeries but in proportion as they destroyed one plague they were pestered with greater and these insects multiplied in such an amazing abundance as to destroy not only the verdure of the fields but even the roots of vegetables not yet shot forth One farm in particular was so injured by them in the year that the occupier was not able to pay his rent and the landlord was not only content to lose his income for that year but also gave money for the sup∣port of the farmer and his family In Ireland they suffered so much by these insects that they came to a resolution of setting fire to a wood of some miles in extent to prevent their mischievous propagation  Of all the beetle kind this is the most nume∣rous and therefore deserves the chief attention of history The numerous varieties of other kinds might repay the curiosity of the diligent observer but we must be content in general to observe that in the great outlines of the history they resemble those of which we have just been giving a description like them all  other beetles are bred from the egg which is deposited in the ground or sometimes tho' seldom in the barks of trees they change into a worm they subsist in that state by living up∣on the roots of vegetables or the succulent parts of the bark round them They generally live a year at least before they change into an aurelia in that state they are not entirely mo∣tionless nor intirely swaddled up without form  It would be tedious and endless to give a description of all and yet it would be an un∣pardonable omission not to mention the parti∣cularities of some beetles which are singular rather from their size their manners or their formation That beetle which the Americans call the tumbledung particularly demands our attention it is all over of a dusky black rounder than those animals are generally found to be and so strong tho' not much larger than the common black beetle that if one of them be put under a brass candlestick it will cause it to move backwards and forwards as if it were by an invisible hand to the admiration of those who are not accustomed to the sight but this strength is given it for much more use∣ful purposes than those of exciting human curi∣osity for there is no creature more laborious either in seeking subsistence or in providing a  proper retreat for its young They are endow∣ed with sagacity to discover subsistence by their excellent smelling which directs them in flights to excrements just fallen from man or beast on which they instantly drop and fall unanimously to work in forming round balls or pellets there∣of in the middle of which they lay an egg These pellets in September they convey three feet deep in the earth where they lye till the approach of spring when the eggs are hatched and burnt their nests and the insects find their way out of the earth They assist each other with indefatigable industry in rolling these globular pellets to the place where they are to be buried This they are to perform with the tail foremost by raising up their hinder part and shoving along the ball with their hindfeet They are always accompanied with other beetles of a larger size and of a more elegant structure and colour The breast of this is covered with a shield of a crimson co∣lour and shininglike metal the head is of the like colour mixed with green and on the crown of the head stands a shining black horn bended backwards These are called the kings of the beetles but for what reason is uncer∣tain since they partake of the same dirty drud∣gery with the rest  The Elephantbeetle is the largest of this kind hitherto known and is found in SouthAmerica particularly Guiana and Surinam as well as a∣bout the river Oroonoko It is of a black co∣lour and the whole body is covered with a very hard shell full as thick and as strong as that of a small crab Its length from the hinder part to the eyes is almost four inches and from the same part to the end of the proboscis or trunk four inches and three quarters The transverse dia∣meter of the body is two inches and a quarter and the breadth of each elytron or case for the wings is an inch and three tenths The an∣tennae or feelers are quite horny for which reason the proboscis or trunk is moveable at its insertion into the head and seems to sup∣ply the place of feelers The horns are eight tenths of an inch long and terminate in points The proboscis is an inch and a quarter long and turns upwards making a crooked line terminating in two horns each of which is near a quarter of an inch long but they are not perforated at the end like the proboscis of other insects About four tenths of an inch above the head or that side next the body is a prominence or small horn which if the rest of the trunk were away would cause this part to resemble the horn of a rhinoceros There is  indeed a beetle so called but then the horns or trunk has no fork at the end though the lower horn resembles this The feet are all forked at the end but not like lobsters claws  To this class we may also refer the glowworm that little animal which makes such a distinguished figure in the descriptions of our poets No two insects can differ more than the male and female of this species from each other The male is in every respect a beetle having cases to its wings and rising in the air at pleasure the female on the contrary has none but is entirely a creeping insect and is obliged to wait the approaches of her capri∣cious companion The body of the female has eleven joints with a shield breastplate the shape of which is oval the head is placed over this and is very small and the three last joints of her body are of a yellowish colour but what distinguishes it from all other animals at least in this part of the world is the shining light which it emits by night and which is supposed by force philosophers to be an emanation which she sends forth to allure the male to her com∣pany Most travellers who have gone through sandy countries must well remember the little shining sparks with which the ditches are stud∣ded on each side of the road If incited by  curiosity to approach more nearly he will find the light sent forth by the glowworm if he should keep the little animal for some time its light continues to grow paler and at last ap∣pears totally extinct The manner in which this light is produced has hitherto continued inexplicable it is probable the little animal is supplied with some electrical powers so that by rubbing the joints of its body against each other it thus supplies a stream of light which if it allures the male as we are told serves for very useful purposes  The cantharis is of the beetle kind from whence come cantharides well known in the chops by the name of Spanish flies and for their use in blisters They have feelers like bristles flexible cases to the wings a breast pretty plain and the sides of the belly wrink∣led Cantharides differ from each other in their size shape and colour those used in the shops also do the same The largest in these parts are about an inch long and as much in cir∣cumference but others are not above three quarters of an inch Some are of a pure azure colour others of pure gold and others again have a mixture of pure gold and azure colours but they are all very brilliant and extremely beautiful These insects as is well  known are of the greatest benefit to mankind making a part in many medicines conducive to human preservation They are chiefly natives of Spain Italy and Portugal but they are to be met with also about Paris in the summer time upon the leaves of the ash the poplar and the rosetrees and also among wheat and in meadows It is very certain that these in∣sects are fond of ash leaves insomuch that they will sometimes strip one of these trees quite bare Some affirm that these flies de∣light in sweetsmelling herbs and it is very certain that they are fond of honeysuckles liloc and wildcherry shrubs but some that have sought after them declare they never could find them on eldertrees nuttrees and among wheat We are told that the country people expect the return of these insects every seven years It is very certain that such a num∣ber of these insects have been seen together in the air that they appeared like swarms of bees and that they have so disagreeable a smell that it may be perceived a great way off especially about sunset though they are not seen at that time This bad smell is a guide for those who make it their business to catch them When they are caught they dry them after which they are so light that fifty will hardly weigh a  dram Those that gather them tie them in a bag or a piece of linnen cloth that has been well worn and then they kill them with the vapours of hot vinegar after which they dry them in the sun and keep them in boxes These flies thus dried being chymically ana∣lysed yield a great deal of volatile causticsalt mixed with a little oil phlegm and earth Cantharides are penetrating corrosive and ap∣plied to the skin raise blisters from whence proceeds a great deal of serosity They are made use of both inwardly and outwardly However it is somewhat strange that the effects of these flies should fall principally upon the urinary passages for though some authors have endeavoured to account for this we are mill in the dark for all they have said amounts to no more than that they affect these parts in a manner which may be very learnedly described but very obscurely comprehended  An insect of great tho' perhaps not equal use in medicine is that which is known by the name of the kermes it is produced in the ex∣crescence of an oak called the berrybearing ilex and appears at first wrapt up in a membranaceous bladder of the size of a pea smooth and shining of a brownish red colour and covered with a very fine ashcoloured pow∣der  This bag teems with a number of reddish eggs or insects which being rubbed with the fingers pour out a crimson liquor It is only met with in warm countries in the months of May and June In the month of April this insect becomes of the size and shape of a pea and its eggs some time after burst from the womb and soon turning worms run about the branches and leaves of the tree They are of two sexes and the females have been hitherto described but the males are very distinct from the former and are a sort of small flies like gnats with six feet of which the four forward are short and the two backward long divided into four joints and armed with three crooked nails There are two feelers on the head a line and a half long which are moveable streaked and articulated The tail at the back part of the body is half a line long and forked The whole body is covered with two transparent wings and they leap about in the manner of fleas The har∣vest of the kermes is greater or less in propor∣tion to the severity of the winter and the wo∣men gather them before sunrising tearing them off with their nails for fear there should be any loss from the hatching of the insects They sprinkle them with vinegar and lay them in the sun to dry where they acquire a red colour  An insect perhaps still more useful than either of the former is the cochineal which has been very variously described by authors some have supposed it a vegetable excrescence from the tree upon which it is found some have described it as a louse some as a bug and some as a beetle As they appear in our shops when brought from America they are of an irre∣gular shape convex on one side and a little concave on the other but are both marked with transverse streaks or wrinkles They are of a scarlet colour within and without of a blackish red and sometimes of a white reddish or ashcolour which are accounted the best and are brought to us from Mexico The cochineal insect is of an oval form of the size of a small pea with six feet and a snout or trunk It brings forth its young alive and is nourished by sucking the juice of the plant Its body consists of several rings and when it is once fixed on the plant it continues immove∣able being subject to no change Some pre∣tend there are two sorts the one domestic which is best and the other wild that is of a vivid colour however they appear to be the same only with this difference that the Wild feeds upon uncultivated trees without any assis∣tance whereas the domestic is carefully at a  stated season removed to cultivated trees where it feeds upon a purer juice Those who take care of these insects place them on the prickly pear plant in a certain order and are very industrious in defending them from other insects for if any other kind come among them they take care to brush them off with foxes tails Towards the end of the year when the rains and cold weather are coming on which are fatal to these insects they take off the leaves or branches covered with cochineal that have not attained their utmost degree of perfection and keep them in their houses till winter is past These leaves are very thick and juicy and supply them with sufficient nourish∣ment while they remain within doors When the milder weather returns and these animals are about to exclude their young the natives make them nests like those of birds but less of treemoss or soft hay or the down of co∣coanuts placing twelve in every nest These they fix on the thorns of the prickly pearplant and in three or four days time they bring forth their young which leave their nests in a few days and creep upon the branches of the plant till they find a proper place to rest in and take in their nourishment and until the fe∣males are secundated by the males which as  in the former tribe differ very widely from the females being winged insects whereas the others only creep and are at most stationary When they are impregnated they produce a new offspring so that the propagator has a new harvest thrice a year When the native Americans have gathered the cochineal they put them into holes in the ground where they kill them with boiling water and afterwards dry them in the sun or in an oven or lay them upon hot plates From the various me∣thods of killing them arise the different co∣lours which they appear in when brought to us While they are living they seem to be sprinkled over with a white powder which they lose as soon as the boiling water is poured upon them Those that are dried upon hot places are the blackest What we call the co∣chineal are only the females for the males are a sort of fly as already observed in the kermes They are used both for dyeing and medicine and are said to have much the same virtue as the ker∣mes tho' they are now seldom used alone but are mixed with other things for the sake of the colour  I shall end this account of the beetle tribe with the history of an animal which cannot pro∣perly be ranked under this species and yet which cannot be more methodically ranged under  any other This is the insect that forms and resides in the gallnut the spoils of which are converted to such useful purposes The gall insects are bred in a sort of bodies adhering to a kind of oak in Asia which differ with regard to their colour size roughness smoothness and shape and which we call galls They are not fruit as some have imagined but preternatural tumours owing to the wounds given to the buds leaves and twigs of the tree by a kind of insects that lay their eggs within them This animal is furnished with an implement by which the female penetrates into the bark of the tree or into that spot which just begins to bud and there sheds a drop of corrosive fluid into the cavity Having thus formed a recepta∣cle for her eggs she deposites them in the place and dies soon after The heart of the bud be∣ing thus wounded the circulation of the nu∣tritive juice is interrupted and the fermentation thereof with the poison injected by the fly burns the parts adjacent and then alters the natural colour of the plant The juice or sap turned bark from its natural course extravasates and flows round the egg After which it swells and dilates by the assistance of some bubbles of air which get admission through the pores of the bark and which run in the vessels with the sap  The external coat of this excrescence is dried by the air and grows into a figure which bears some resemblance to the bow of an arch or the roundness of a kernel This little ball receives its nutriment growth and vegetation as the other parts of the tree by slow degrees and is what we call the gallnut The worm that is hatched un∣der this spacious vault finds in the substance of the ball which is as yet very tender a subsistence suitable to its nature gnaws and digests it till the time comes for its transformation to a nymph and from that state of existence changes into a fly After this the insect perceiving it∣self duly provided with all things requisite dis∣engages itself soon from its confinement and takes its flight into the open air The case how∣ever is not similar with respect to the gallnut that grows in autumn The cold weather fre∣quently comes on before the worm is transform∣ed into a fly or before the fly can pierce through its inclosure The nut falls with the leaves and altho' you may imagine that the fly which lies within is lost yet in reality it is not so on the contrary its being covered up so close is the means of its preservation Thus it spends the winter in a warm house where every crack and cranny of the nut is well stopped up and lies buried as it were under a heap of leaves  which preserves it from the injuries of the weather This apartment however tho' so commodious a retreat in the winter is a per∣fect prison in the spring The fly rouzed out of its lethargy by the first heats breaks its way through and ranges where it pleases A very small aperture is sufficient since at this time the fly is but a diminutive crea∣ture Besides the ringlets whereof its body is composed dilate and become pliant is the passage  CHAP VII Of the Gnat and the Tipula  THERE are two insects which entirely re∣semble each other in their form and yet widely differ in their habits manners and propaga∣tion Those who have seen the tipula or longlegs and the larger kind of gnat have most probably mistaken the one for the other they have often accused the tipula a harmless insect of depredations made by the gnat and the innocent have suffered for the guilty in∣deed the differences in their form are so very minute that it often requires the assistance of a microscope to distinguish the one from the other they are both mounted on long legs both furnished with two wings and a slender body their heads are large and they seem to be humpbacked the chief and only difference therefore is that the tipula wants a trunk while the gnat has a large one which it often exerts to very mischievous purposes The tipula is a harmless peaceful insect that offers injury to nothing the gnat is sanguinary and  predaceous ever seeking out for a place in which to bury its trunk and pumping up the blood from the animal in large quantities  The gnat proceeds from a little worm which is usually seen at the bottom of standing waters The manner in which the insect lays its eggs is particularly curious after having laid the pro∣per number on the surface of the water it sur∣rounds them with a kind of unctuous matter which prevents them from sinking but at the same time fastens them with a thread to the bottom to prevent their floating away at the mercy of every breeze from a place the warmth of which is proper for their production to any other where the water may be too cold or the animals its enemies too numerous Thus the insects in their egg state resemble a buoy which is fixed by an anchor As they come to maturity they sink deeper and at last when they leave the egg as worms they creep at the bottom They now make themselves lodg∣ments of cement which they fasten to some solid body at the very bottom of the water unless by accident they meet with a piece of chalk which being of a soft and pliant nature gives them an opportunity of sinking a retreat for themselves where nothing but the claws of a crayfish can possibly molest them The worm  afterwards changes its form It appears with a large head and a tail invested with hair and moistened with an oleaginous liquor which she makes use of as a cork to sustain her head in the air and her tail in the water and to tran∣sport her from one place to another When the oil with which her tail is moistened begins to grow dry she discharges out of her mouth an unctuous humour which she sheds all over her tail by virtue whereof she is enabled totransport herself where she pleases without be∣ing either wet or any ways incommoded by the water The gnat in her second state is pro∣perly speaking in her form of a nymph which is an introduction or entrance into a new life In the first place the diverts herself of her se∣cond skin in the next she resigns her eyes her antennae and her tail in short she actually seems to expire However from the spoils of the amphibious animal a little winged insect cuts the air whose every part is active to the last de∣gree and whose whole structure is the just ob∣ject of our admiration Its little head is adorn∣ed with a plume of feathers and its whole body invested with scales and hair to secure it from any wet or dust She makes trial of the activity of her wings by rubbing them either against her body or her broad sidebags  which keep her in an equilibrium The fur∣below or little border of fine feathers which graces her wings is very curious and strikes the eye in the most agreeable manner There is nothing however of greater importance to the gnat than her trunk and that weak imple∣ment may justly be deemed one of nature's masterpieces It is so very small that the extremity of it can scarcely be discerned through the best microscope that can be procured That part which is at first obvious to the eye is nothing but a long scaly sheath under the throat At near the distance of two thirds of it there is an aperture through which the in∣sect darts out four stings and afterwards retracts them One of which however sharp and ac∣tive it may be is no more than the case in which the other three lie concealed and run in a long groove The sides of these stings are sharpened like twoedged swords they are likewise barbed and have a vast number of cutting teeth towards the point which turns up like a hook and is fine beyond expression When all these darts are stuck into the flesh of animals sometimes one after another and sometimes all at once the blood and humours of the adjacent parts must unavoidably be ex∣travasated upon which a tumour must conse∣quently  ensue the little orifice whereof is closed up by the compression of the external air When the gnat by the point of her case which she makes use of as a tongue has tasted any fruit flesh or juice that she has found out if it be a fluid she sucks it up without play∣ing her darts into it but in case she finds the least obstruction by any flesh whatever she ex∣erts her strength and pierces through it if possibly she can After this she draws back her stings into their sheath which she applies to the wound in order to extract as through a reed the juices which she finds inclosed This is the implement with which the gnat performs her work in the summer for during the winter the has no manner of occasion for it Then she ceases to eat and spends all that tedious season either in quarries or in caverns which she abandons at the return of summer and flies about in search after some commodious ford or standing water where she may produce her progeny which would be soon washed a∣way and lost by the too rapid motion of any running stream The little brood are some∣times so numerous that the very water is tin∣ged according to the colour of the species as green if they be green and of a sanguine hue if they be red  These are circumstances sufficiently extraor∣dinary in the life of this little animal but it offers something still more curious in the me∣thod of its propagation However similar in∣sects of the gnat kind are in their appearance yet they differ widely from each other in the manner in which they are brought forth for some are ovi∣parous and are produced from eggs some are viviparous and come forth in their most per∣fect form some are males and unite with the female some are females requiring the im∣pregnation of the male some are of neither sex yet still produce young without any copu∣lation whatsoever This is one of the strangest discoveries in all natural history A gnat se∣parated from the rest of its kind and inclosed in a glass vessel with air sufficient to keep it alive shall produce young which also when separated from each other shall be the parents of a numerous progeny Thus down for five or six generations do these extraordinary animals propagate without the use of copulation with∣out any congress between the male and female but in the manner of vegetables the young bursting from the body of their parents without any previous impregnation At the sixth genera∣tion however their propagation stops the gnat no longer produces its like from itself  alone but it requires the access of the male to give it another succession of secundity  The gnat of Europe gives but little uneasi∣ness it is sometimes heard to hum about our beds at night and keeps off the approaches of sleep by the apprehension it causes but it is very different in the illpeopled regions of America where the waters stagnate and the climate is warm and where they are produced in multitudes beyond expression The whole air is there filled with clouds of those famished insects and they are found of all sizes from six inches long to a minuteness that even re∣quires the microscope to have a distinct percep∣tion of them The warmth of the midday sun is too powerful for their constitutions but when the evening approaches neither art nor flight can shield the wretched inhabitants from their at∣tacks tho' millions are destroyed still millions more succeed and produce unceasing torment The native Indians who anoint their bodies with oil and who have from their infancy been used to their depredations find them much less inconvenient than those who are newly ar∣rived from Europe they sleep in their cot∣tages covered all over with thousands of the gnat kind upon their bodies and yet do not seem to have their slumbers interrupted by  their cruel devourers If a candle happens to be lighted in one of those places a cloud of insects at once light upon the flame and extinguish it they are therefore obliged to keep their candles in glass lanthorns a mi∣serable expedient to prevent an unceasing calamity  PART V  CHAP VIII Of Zoophytes in General  WE are now come to the last link in the chain of animated nature to a class of beings so confined in their powers and so defective in their formation that some historians have been at a loss whether to consider them as a superior rank of vegetables or the humblest order of the animated tribe In order therefore to give them a denomination agreeable to their existence they have been called Zoophytes a name implying vegetable nature indued with animal life and indeed in some the marks of the animal are so few that it is difficult to give their place in nature with precision or to tell whether it is a plant or an insect that is the object of our consideration  Should it be asked what it is that constitutes the difference between animal and vegetable life what it is that lays the line that separates those two great kingdoms from each other it would be difficult perhaps we should find it impossible to return an answer The power of motion cannot form this distinction since some vegetables are possest of motion and  many animals are totally without it The sen∣sitive plant has obviously a greater variety of motions than the oyster or the pholas The animal that fills the acornshell is immoveable and can only close its lid to defend itself from external injury while the flower which goes by the name of the flytrap seems to close upon the flies that light upon it and that attempt to rifle it of its honey The animal in this instance seems to have scarce a power of self defence the ve∣getable not only guards its possessions but seizes upon the robber that would venture to invade them In like manner the methods of propaga∣tion give no superiority to the lower rank of ani∣mals On the contrary vegetables are frequently produced more conformably to the higher ranks of the creation and though some plants are pro∣duced by cuttings from others yet the general manner of propagation is from seeds laid in the womb of the earth where they are hatched into the similitude of the parent plant or flower But a most numerous tribe of animals have lately been discovered which are propagated by cuttings and this in so extraordinary a manner that though the original insect be divided into a thousand parts each however small shall be formed into an animal entirely resembling that which was at first divided in this respect  therefore certain races of animals seem to fall beneath vegetables by their more imperfect propagation  What therefore is the distinction between them or are the orders so intimately blended as that it is impossible to mark the boundaries of each To me it would seem that all animals are possessed of one power of which vegetables are totally deficient I mean either the actual ability or an aukward attempt at selfpreser∣vation However vegetables may seem possessed of this important quality yet it is with them but a mechanical impulse resembling the rais∣ing one end of the lever when you depress the other the sensitive plant contracts and hangs its leaves indeed when touched but this mo∣tion no way contributes to its safety the flytrap flower acts entirely in the same manner and though it seems to seize the little animal that comes to annoy it yet in reality only closes mechanically upon it and this inclosure neither contributes to its preservation nor its defence But it is very different with insects even of the lowest order the earthworm not only contracts but hides itself in the earth and escapes with force share of swiftness from its pursuers The polypus hides its horns the starfish contracts its arms upon the ap∣pearance  even of distant dangers they not only hunt for their food but provide for their safety and however imperfectly they may be formed yet still they are in reality placed many degrees above the highest vegetable of the earth and are possessed of many animal functions as well as those that are more elaborately formed  But though these be superior to plants they are very far beneath their animated fellows of existence In the class of zoophytes we may place all those animals which may be propa∣gated by cuttings or in other words which if divided into two or more parts each part in time becomes a separate and perfect animal the head shoots forth a tail and on the contrary the tail produces a head some of these will bear dividing but into two parts such is the earthworm some may be divided into more than two and of this kind are many of the star fish others still may be cut into a thousand parts each becoming a per∣fect animal they may be turned inside out like the finger of a glove they may be mould∣ed into all manner of shapes yet still their vivacious principle remains still every single part becomes perfect in its kind and after a few days existence exhibits all the arts and in∣dustry  of its contemptible parent We shall therefore divide zoophytes according to their several degrees of perfection namely into worms starfish and polypi contenting our∣selves with a short review of those nauseous and despicable creatures that excite our curiosity chiefly by their imperfections it must not be concealed however that much has of late been written on this part of natural history A new mode of animal production could not fail of exciting not only the curiosity but the asto∣nishment of every philosopher many found their favourite systems totally overthrown by the dis∣covery and it was not without a wordy struggle that they gave up what had formerly been their pleasure and their pride At last however con∣viction became too strong for argument and a question which owed its general spread rather to its novelty than to its importance was given up in favour of the new discovery  CHAP IX Of Worms  THE first in the class of zoophytes are animals of the worm kind which being entirely destitute of feet trail themselves along upon the ground and find themselves a retreat under the earth or in the water As these like ser∣pents have a creeping motion so both in general go under the common appellation of reptiles a loathsome noxious malignant tribe to which man by nature as well as by religion has the strongest antipathy But though worms as well as serpents are mostly without feet and have been doomed to creep along the earth on their bellies yet their motions are very different The serpent as has been said before having a back bone which it is incapable of contract∣ing bends its body into the form of a bow and then shoots forward from the tail but it is very different with the worm which has a power of contracting or lengthening itself at will There is a spiral muscle that runs round its whole body from the head to tail somewhat resembling a wire wound round a walkingcane  which when slipped off and one end extended and held fast will bring the other nearer to it in this manner the earthworm having shot out or extended its body takes hold by the slime of the fore part of its body and so contracts and brings forward the hinder part in this manner it moves onward not without great effort but the occasions for its progressive motion are few  As it is designed for living under the earth and leading a life of obscurity so it seems toler∣ably adapted to its situation Its body is armed with small stiff sharp burrs or prickles which it can erect or depress at pleasure under the skin there lies a slimy juice to be ejected as oc∣casion requires at certain perforations between the rings of the musces to lubricate its body and facilitate its passage into the earth Like most other insects it hath breathingholes along the back adjoining each ring but it is without bones without eyes without ears and properly without feet It has a mouth and also an elemen∣tary canal which runs along to the very point of the tail In some worms however particular∣ly such as are found in the bodies of animals this canal opens towards the middle of the belly at some distance from the tail The in∣testines of the earthworm are always found  filled with a very fine earth which seems to be the only nourishment these animals are capable of receiving  The animal is entirely without brain but near the head is placed the heart which is seen to beat with a very distinct motion and round it are the spermatic vessels forming a number of little globules containing a milky fluid which have an opening into the belly not far from the head they are also often found to contain a number of eggs which are laid in the earth and are hatched in twelve or four∣teen days into life by the genial warmth of their situation like snails all these animals unite in themselves both sexes at once the reptile that impregnates being impregnated in turn few that walk out but must have ob∣served them with their heads laid against each other and so strongly attached that they suffer themselves to be trod upon  When the eggs are laid in the earth which in about fourteen days as has been said are hatched into maturity the young ones come forth very small but perfectly formed and suffer no change during their ex∣istence how long their life continues is not well known but it certainly holds for more than two or three seasons During the winter  they bury themselves deeper in the earth and seem in some measure to share the general torpidity of the insect tribe In spring they revive with the rest of nature and on those oc∣casions a moist or dewy evening brings them forth from their retreats for the universal pur∣pose of continuing their kind They chiefly live in a light rich and fertile soil moistened by dews or accidental showers but avoid those places where the water is apt to lie on the sur∣face of the earth or where the clay is too stiff for their easy progression under ground  Helpless as they are formed yet they seem very vigilant in avoiding those animals that chiefly make them their prey in particular the mole who feeds entirely upon them be∣neath the surface and who seldom ventures from the dimness of its sight into the open air him they avoid by darting up from the earth the instant they feel the ground move and fishermen who are well acquainted with this take them in what numbers they chuse by stirring the earth where they expect to find them They are also driven from their retreats under ground by pouring bitter or acrid water thereon such as that water in which green walnuts have been steeped or a lye made of potashes  Such is the general outline of the history of these reptiles which as it should seem degrades them no way beneath the rank of other animals of the insect creation but we now come to a part of their history which proves the imperfection of their organs from the easiness with which these little machines may be damaged and re∣paired again It is well known in mechanics that the finest and most complicated instruments are the most easily put out of order and the most difficultly set right the same also obtains in the animal machine Man the most com∣plicated machine of all others whose nerves are more numerous and powers of action more various is most easily destroyed he is seen to die under wounds which a quadruped or a bird could easily survive and as we descend gradu∣ally to the lower ranks the ruder the composi∣tion the more difficult it is to disarange it Some animals live without their limbs and of∣ten are seen to reproduce them some are seen to live without their brain for many weeks to∣gether caterpillars continue to increase and grow large tho' all their nobler organs are in∣tirely destroyed within some animals continue to exist though cut in two their nobler parts pre∣serving life while the others perish that were cut away but the earth worm and all the  zoophyte tribe continue to live in separate parts and one animal by the means of cut∣ting is divided into two distinct existences sometimes into a thousand  There is no phaenomenon in all natural histo∣ry more astonishing than this that man at plea∣sure should have a kind of creative power and out of one life make two each compleatly formed with all its apparatus and functions each with its perceptions and powers of motion and selfpreservation each as compleat in all respects as that from which it derived its exist∣ence and equally enjoying the humble grati∣fications of its nature  When De Cartes first started the opinion that brutes were machines the discovery of this surprising propagation was unknown which might in some measure have strengthened his fanciful theory What is life in brutes he might have said or where does it reside In some we find it so diffused that every part seems to maintain a vivacious principle and the same animal appears possessed of a thousand distinct irrational souls at the same time But let us not he would say give so noble a name to such contemptible powers but rank the vivi∣fying principle in these with the sap that rises in vegetables or the moisture that contracts a  cord or the heat that puts water into motion Nothing in fact deserves the name of soul but that which reasons that which understands and by knowing God receives the mark of its currency and is minted with the impression of its great Creator  Sucb might have been the speculations of this philosopher however to leave theory it will be sufficient to say that we owe the first discovery of this power of reproduction in animals to Mr Trembley who first observed it in the polypus and after him Spalanzani and others found it taking place in the earthworm the seaworm and several other illformed animals of a like kind which were susceptible of this new mode of propagation This last philosopher has tried several experiments upon the earthworm many of which succeeded according to his expectation every earthworm however did not retain the vivacious principle with the same obstinacy some when cut in two were intirely destroyed others survived only in the nobler part and while the head was living the tail entirely pe∣rished and a new one was seen to burge on from the extremity But what was most sur∣prising of all in some particularly in the small redheaded earth worm both extremities survived the operation the head produced a  tail with the anus the intestines the anular muscles and the prickly beards the tail part on the other hand was seen to shoot forth the nobler organs and in less than the space of three months sent forth a head heart with all the apparatus and instruments of gene∣ration This part as may easily be supposed was produced much more slowly than the for∣mer a new head taking above three or four months for its completion a new tail being shot forth in less than as many weeks Thus two animals by dissection were made out of one each with their separate appetites each endued with life and motion and seemingly as perfect as that single animal from whence they derived their origin  What was performed upon the earthworm was found to obtain also in many other of the vermicular species The seaworm the white waterworm and many of those little worms with feelers found at the bottom of dirty ditches in all these the nobler organs are of such little use that if taken away the ani∣mal does not seem to feel the want of them it lives in all its parts and in every part and by a strange paradox in nature the most useless and contemptible life is of all others the most difficult to destroy  CHAP X Of the Starfish  THE next order of zoophytes is that of the star fish a numerous tribe shapeless and de∣formed assuming at different times different appearances The same animal that now appears round like a ball shortly after flattens as thin as a plate All of this kind are formed of a se∣mitransparent gelatinous substance covered with a thin membrane and to an inattentive spectator often appear like a lump of inani∣mate jelly floating at random upon the surface of the sea or thrown by chance on shore at the departure of the tide But upon a more minute inspection they will be found possessed of life and motion they will be found to shoot forth their arms in every direction in order to seize upon such insects as are near and to devour them with great rapacity Worms the spawn of fish and even muscles themselves with their hard resisting shell have been found in the sto∣machs of these voracious animals and what is very extraordinary tho' the substance of their own bodies be almost as soft as water yet they are no way injured by swallowing  depiction of the cuttlefish the sea star starfish and the sea nettle type of jellyfish  The Cuttle Fish    The Sea Star    The Sea Nettle  E Martin sculp  these shells which are almost of a stony hardness They increase in size as all other ani∣mals do In summer when the water of the sea is warmed by the heat of the sun they float upon the surface and in the dark they send forth a kind of shining light resembling that of phosphorus Some have given these animals the name of seanettles because they burn the hands of those that touch them as nettles are found to do They are often seen fastened to the rocks and to the largest seashells as if to de∣rive their nourishment from them If they be taken and put into spirit of wine they will con∣tinue for many years intire but if they be left to the influence of the air they are in less than four and twenty hours melted down into a limpid and offensive water  In all of this species none are found to pos∣sess a vent for their excrements but the same passage by which they devour their food serves for the ejection of their faeces These animals as was said take such a variety of figures that it is impossible to describe them under one deter∣minate shape but in general their bodies re∣semble a truncated cone whose base is applied to the rock to which they are found usually attached Tho' generally transparent yet they are found of different colours some inclining to  green some to red some to white and some to brown In some their colours appear dif∣fused over the whole surface in some they are often streaked and in others often spotted They are possest of a very slow progressive mo∣tion and in fine weather they are continually seen stretching out and fishing for their prey Many of them are possest of a number of long slender filaments in which they entangle any small animals they happen to approach and thus draw them into their enormous stomachs which fill the whole cavity of their bodies The harder shells continue for some weeks in∣digested but at length they undergo a kind of maceration in the stomach and become a part of the substance of the animal itself The indigestible parts are returned by the same aperture by which they were swallowed and then the starfish begins to fish for more These also may be cut in pieces and every part will survive the operation each becoming a perfect animal endued with its natural rapacity Of this tribe the num∣ber is various and the description of each would be tedious and uninstructing the man∣ners and nature of all are nearly as described but I will just make mention of one creature which tho' not properly belonging to this class  yet is so nearly related that the passing it in silence would be an unpardonable omission  Of all other animals the cuttlefish tho' in some respect superior to this tribe possesses qualities the most extraordinary It is about two feet long covered with a very thin skin and its flesh composed of a gelatinous substance which however within side is strengthened by a strong bone of which such great use is made by the goldsmiths It is possessed of eight arms which it extends and which are proba∣bly of service to it in fishing for its prey while in life it is capable of lengthening or contract∣ing these at pleasure but when dead they con∣tract and lose their rigidity They feed upon small fish which they seize with their arms and they are bred from eggs which are laid upon the weeds along the seashore  The cuttle fish is found along many of the coasts of Europe but are not easily caught from a contrivance with which they are furnish∣ed by nature this is a black substance of the colour of ink which is contained in a bladder generally on the leftside of the belly and which is ejected in the manner of an excrement from the anus Whenever therefore this fish is pur∣sued and when it finds a difficulty of escaping it spurts forth a great quantity of this black  liquor by which the waters are totally darken∣ed and then it escapes by lying close at the bottom In this manner the creature finds its safety and men find ample cause for admira∣tion from the great variety of stratagems with which creatures are endued for their peculiar preservation  CHAP XI Of the Polypus  THOSE animals which we have described in the last chapter are variously denominated They have been called the Starfish Seanet∣tles and Seapolypi This last name has been peculiarly ascribed to them by the ancients because of the number of feelers or feet of which they are all possest and with which they have a slow progressive motion but the mo∣derns have given the name of Polypus to a reptile that lives in fresh water by no means so large or observable These are found at the bottom of wet ditches or attached to the un∣der surface of the broadleafed plants that grow and swim on the waters The same difference holds between these and the seawater polypus as between all the productions of the sea and of the land and the ocean The marine vegetables and animals grow to a monstrous size The eel the pike or the bream of freshwaters is but small but in the sea they grow to an enormous magnitude The herbs of the field are at most but a few feet high those of the sea often shoot forth a stalk of a hundred It is so between the polypi of  both elements Those of the sea are found from two feet in length to three or four and Pliny has even described one the arms of which were no less than thirty feet long Those in fresh waters however are comparatively minute at their utmost size seldom above three parts of an inch long and when gathered up into their usual form not above a third even of those dimensions  It was upon these minute animals that the power of dissection was first tried in multiply∣ing their numbers They had been long con∣sidered as little worthy the attention of observ∣ers and were consigned to that neglect in which thousands of minute species of insects remain to this very day It is true indeed that Reau∣mur observed classed and named them By contemplating their motions he was enabled di∣stinctly to pronounce on their being of the animal and not of the vegetable kingdom and he call∣ed them Polypi from their great resemblance to those larger ones that were found in the ocean Still however their properties were neglected and their history unknown  Mr Trembley was the person to whom we owe the first discovery of the amazing properties and powers of this little vivacious creature He divided this class of animals into four different  kinds into those inclining to green those of a brownish cast those of fleshcolour those which he calls the polype dé panache The differences of structure in these as also of co∣lour are observable enough but the manner of their subsisting of seizing their prey and of their propagation is pretty nearly the same in all  Whoever has looked with care into the bot∣tom of a wet ditch when the water is stagnant and the sun has been powerful may remember to have seen many little transparent lumps of jelly about the size of a pea and flatted on one side such also as have examined the un∣der side of the broadleafed weeds that grow on the surface of the water must have observed them studded with a number of these little jellylike substances which were probably then dis∣regarded because their nature and history was unknown These little substances however were no other than living polypi gathered up into a quiescent state and seemingly inanimate because either disturbed or not excited by the calls of appetite to action When they are seen exert∣ing themselves they put on a very different appearance from that when at rest to conceive a just idea of their figure we may suppose the finger of a glove cut off at the bottom we may  suppose also several threads or horns plant∣ed round the edge like a fringe The hollow of this finger will give us an idea of the stomach of the animal the threads issuing forth from the edges may be considered as the arms or feelers with which it hunts for its prey The animal at its greatest extent is seldom seen above an inch and a half long but it is much shorter when it is contracted and at rest it is furnished neither with muscles nor rings and its manner of length∣ening or contracting itself more resembles that of the snail than worms or any other insect The polypus contracts itself more or less in proportion as it is touched or as the water is agitated in which they are seen Warmth ani∣mates them and cold benumbs them but it requires a degree of cold approaching conge∣lation before they are reduced to perfect in∣activity those of an inch have generally their arms double often thrice as long as their bo∣dies The arms where the animal is not disturb∣ed and the season not unfavourable are thrown about in various directions in order to seize and entangle its little prey sometimes three or four of the arms are thus employed while the rest are contracted like the horns of a snail within the animal's body It seems capable of giving what length it pleases to these arms it con∣tracts  and extends them at pleasure and stretches them only in proportion to the remote∣ness of the object it would seize  These animals have a progressive motion which is performed by that power they have of lengthening and contracting themselves at plea∣sure they go from one part of the bottom to another they mount along the margin of the water and climb up the side of aquatic plants They often are seen to come to the surface of the water where they suspend themselves by their lower end As they advance but very slowly they employ a great deal of time in every action and bind themselves very strongly to whatever body they chance to move upon as they proceed their adhesion is voluntary and is probably performed in the manner of a cupping glass ap∣plied to the body  All animals of this kind have a remarkable attachment to turn towards the light and this naturally might induce an enquirer to look for their eyes but however carefully this search has been pursued and however excellent the microscope with which every part was examined yet nothing of the appearance of this or∣gan was found over the whole body and it is most probable that like several o∣ther insects which hunt their prey by their  feeling these creatures are unfurnished with advantages which would be totally useless for their support  In the center of the arms as was said before the mouth is placed which the animal can open and shut at pleasure and this serves at once as a passage for food and an opening for it after digestion The inward part of the animal's body seems to be one great stomach which is open at both ends but the purposes which the opening at the bottom serves are hitherto un∣known but certainly not for excluding their excrements for those are ejected at the aperture by which they are taken in If the surface of the body of this little creature be examined with a microscope it will be found studded with a number of warts as also the arms especially when they are contracted and these tubercles as we shall presently see answer a very important pur∣pose  If we examine their way of living we shall find these insects chiefly subsisting upon others much less than themselves particularly a kind of millepedes that live in the water and a very small red worm which they seize with great avidity In short no insect whatsoever less than themselves seems to come amiss to them their arms as was observed above serve them as a  net would a fisherman or perhaps more ex∣actly speaking as a limetwig does a fowler Wherever their prey is perceived which the ani∣mal effects by its feeling it is sufficient to touch the object it would seize upon and it is fastened without a power of escaping The instant one of this insect's long arms is laid upon a millepede the little insect sticks without a possibility of re∣treating The greater the distance at which it is touched the greater is the ease with which the Polypus brings the prey to its mouth If the lit∣tle object be near tho' irretrievably caught it is not without great difficulty that it can be brought to the mouth and swallowed When the Polypus is unsupplied with prey it testifies its hunger by opening its mouth the aperture however is so small that it cannot be easily perceived but when with any of its long arms it has seized upon its prey it then opens the mouth distinct∣ly enough and this opening is always in pro∣portion to the size of the animal which it would swallow the lips dilate insensibly by small degrees and adjust themselves precisely to the figure of their prey Mr Trembley who took a pleasure in feeding this useless brood found that they could devour aliments of every kind fish and flesh as well as insects but he owns they did not thrive so well upon beef and  veal as upon the little worms of their own provi∣ding When he gave one of these famished rep∣tiles any substance which was improper to serve for aliment at first it seized the prey with avi∣dity but after keeping it some time entangled near the mouth it let drop again with di∣stinguishing nicety  When several polypi happen to fall upon the same worm they dispute their common prey with each other Two of them are often seen seizing the same worm at different ends and dragging it at opposie directions with great force It often happens that while one is swal∣lowing its respective end the other is also em∣ployed in the same manner and thus they con∣tinue swallowing each his part until their mouths meet together they then rest each for some time in this situation till the worm breaks be∣tween them and each goes off with his share but it often happens that a seemingly more dangerous combat ensues when the mouths of both are thus joined upon one common prey to∣gether the largest polypus then gapes and swal∣lows his antagonist but what is very wonderful the animal thus swallowed seems to be rather a gainer by the misfortune After it has lain in the conquerors body for about an hour it is∣sues unhurt and often in possession of the prey  which had been the original cause of conten∣tion how happy would it be for men if they had as little to fear from each other  These reptiles continue eating the whole year except when the cold approaches to congelation and then like most others of the insect tribe they feel the general torpor of nature and all their faculties are for two or three months suspended but if they abstain at one time they are equally voracious at ano∣ther and like snakes ants and other animals that are torpid in winter the meal of one day sufficies them for several months together In general however they devour more largely in proportion to their size and their growth is quick exactly as they are fed such as are best supplied soonest acquire their largest size but they diminish also in their growth with the same facility if their food be taken away  Such are the more obvious properties of these little animals but the most wonderful still remain behind Their manner of propa∣gation or rather multiplication has for some years been the astonishment of all the learned of Europe They are produced in as great a variety of manners as every species of vegetable Some polypi are propagated from eggs as plants are from their seed  some are produced by buds issuing from their bodies as plants are produced by inoculation while all may be multiplied by cuttings and this to a degree of minuteness that exceeds even philosophical perseverance  With respect to such of this kind as are hatched from the egg little curious can be added as it is a method of propagation so com∣mon to all the tribes of insect nature but with regard to such as are produced like buds from their parent stem or like cuttings from an ori∣ginal root their history requires a more de∣tailed explanation If a polypus be carefully observed in summer when these animals are chiefly active and more particularly prepared for propagation it will be found to burgeon forth from different parts of its body several tubercles or little knobs which grow larger and larger every day after two or three days inspection what at first appeared but a small excrescence takes the figure of a small animal entirely resembling its parent furnished with feelers a mouth and all the apparatus for seizing and digesting its prey This little crea∣ture every day becomes larger like the parent to which it continues attached it spreads its arms to seize upon whatever insect is proper for aliment and devours it for its own  particular benefit thus it is possessed of two sources of nourishment that which it receives from the parent by the tail and that which it receives from its own industry by the mouth The food which these animals receive often tinctures the whole body and upon this occa∣sion the parent is often seen communicating a part of its own fluids to that of its progeny that grows upon it while on the contrary it never receives any tincture from any sub∣stance that is caught and swallowed by its young If the parent swallows a red worm which gives a tincture to all its fluids the young one par∣takes of the parental colour but if the latter should seize upon the same prey the parent polypus is no way benefited by the capture but all the advantage remains with the young one  But we are not to suppose that the parent is capable of producing only one at a time se∣veral young ones are thus seen at once of dif∣ferent sizes growing from its body some just budding forth others acquiring their perfect form and others come to sufficient maturity and just ready to drop from the original stem to which they had been attached for several days But what is more extraordinary still those young ones themselves that continue at∣tached  to their parent are seen to burgeon and propagate their own young ones also each holding the same dependance upon its respec∣tive parent and possessed of the same advan∣tages that have been already described in the first connection Thus we see a surprizing chain of existence continued and numbers of animals naturally produced without any union of the sexes or other previous disposition of nature  This seems to be the most natural way by which these insects are multiplied their pro∣duction from the egg being not so common and tho' some of this kind are found with a little bladder attached to their bodies which is supposed to be filled with eggs which afterwards come to maturity yet the artificial method of propagating these animals is much more expeditious and equally certain It is in∣different whether one of them be cut into ten or ten hundred parts each becomes as perfect an animal as that which was originally divided but it must be observed that the smaller the part which is thus separated from the rest the longer it will be in coming to maturity or in assuming its perfect form It would be end∣less to recount the many experiments that have been tried upon this philosophical prodigy  the animal has been twisted and turned into all manner of shapes it has been turned inside out it has been cut in every division yet still it continued to move its parts adapted them∣selves again to each other and in a short time it became as voracious and industrious as be∣fore  Besides these kinds mentioned by MrTremb∣ley there are various others which have been lately discovered by the vigilance of succeeding observers and some of these so strongly re∣semble a flowering vegetable in their forms that they have been mistaken by many natu∣ralists for such Mr Hughes the author of the Natural History of Barbadoes has described a species of this animal but has mistaken its nature and called it a sensitive flowering plant he observed it to take refuge in the holes of rocks and when undisturbed to spread forth a number of ramifications each terminated by a flowery petal which shrunk at the approach of the hand and withdrew into the hole from whence before it had been seen to issue This plant however was no other than an animal of the polypus kind which is not only to be found in Barbadoes but also on many parts of the coast of Cornwall and along the shores of the Continent  CHAP XII Of Lithophytes and Sponges  IT is very probable that the animals we see and are acquainted with bear no manner of proportion to those that are concealed from us Although every leaf and vegetable swarms with animals upon land yet at sea they are still more abundant for the greatest part of what would seem vegetables growing there are in fact nothing but the artificial formation of insects palaces which they have built for their own habitation  If we examine the bottom of the sea along some shores and particularly at the mouths of several rivers we shall find it has the ap∣pearance of a forest of trees under water mil∣lions of plants growing in various directions with their branches entangled in each other and sometime standing so thick as to obstruct navigation The shores of the Persian gulph the whole extent of the Redsea and the western coasts of America are so choaked up in many places with these Coraline substances that tho'  depiction of some types of coral  The Coralplants  E Martin sculp  ships force a passage through them boats and swimmers find it impossible to make their way These aquatic groves are formed of different substances and assume various appearances The coralplants as they are called some∣times shoot out like trees without leaves in winter they often spread out a broad surface like a fan and not uncommonly a large bund∣ling head like a faggot sometimes they are found to resemble a plant with leaves and flowers and often the antlers of a stag with great exactness and regularity In other parts of the sea are seen sponges of various magni∣tude and extraordinary appearances assuming a variety of phantastic forms like large mushrooms mitres fonts and flowerpots To an atten∣tive spectator these various productions seem intirely of the vegetable kind they seem to have their leaves and their flowers and have been experimentally known to shoot out branches in the compass of a year Philoso∣phers therefore till of late thought them∣selves pretty secure in ascribing these producti∣ons to the vegetable kingdom and Count Marsigli who has written very laboriously and learnedly upon the subject of corals and spon∣ges has not hesitated to declare his opinion that they were plants of the aquatic kind fur∣nished  with flowers and seed and endued with a vegetation intirely resembling that which is found upon land This opinion however some time after began to be shaken by Rumphius and Jussieu and at last by the ingeni∣ous Mr Ellis who by a more sagacious and dili∣gent enquiry into nature put it past doubt that corals and sponges were entirely the work of animals and that like the honeycomb which was formed by the bee the coral was the work of an infinite number of reptiles of the polypus kind whose united labours were thus capable of filling whole tracts of the ocean with those embarrassing tokens of their industry  If in our researches after the nature of these plants we should be induced to break off a branch of the coraline substance and observe it carefully we shall perceive its whole surface which is very rugged and irregular covered with a mucous fluid and almost in every part studded with little jellylike drops which when closely examined will be found to be no other than reptiles of the polypus kind These have their motions their arms their appetites exactly resembling those described in the last chapter but they soon expire when taken out of the sea and our curiosity is at once stopped in its  career by the animals ceasing to give any marks of their industry recourse therefore has been had to other expedients in order to de∣termine the nature of the inhabitant as well as the habitation  If a coraline plant be strictly observed while still growing in the sea and the animals upon its surface be not disturbed either by the agi∣tation of the waters or the touch of the ob∣server the little polypi will then be seen in infinite numbers each issuing from its cell and in some kinds the head covered with a little shell resembling an umbrella the arms spread abroad in order to seize its prey while the hinder part still remains attached to its habita∣tion from whence it never wholly removes By this time it is perceived that the number of inha∣bitants is infinitely greater than was at first sus∣pected that they are all assiduously employed in the same pursuits and that they issue from their respective cells and retire into them at plea∣sure Still however there are no proofs that those large branches which they inhabit are en∣tirely the construction of such feeble and minute animals But chemistry will be found to lend a clue to extricate us from our doubts in this par∣ticular Like the shells which are formed by  snails muscles and oysters these cora∣line substances effervesce with acids and may therefore well be supposed to partake of the same animal nature But Mr Ellis went still farther and examined their operations just as they were beginning Observing an oysterbed which had been for some time neglected he there perceived the first rudiments of a coraline plantation and tufts of various kinds shooting from different parts of this favourable soil It was upon these he tried his principal experiment He took out the oysters which were thus furnished with cora∣lines and placed them in a large wooden vessel covering them with seawater In about an hour he perceived the animals which before had been contracted by handling and had shewn no signs of life expanding themselves in every direction and appearing employed in their own natural manner Perceiving them therefore in this state his next aim was to preserve them thus expanded so as to be permanent objects of curiosity For this purpose he poured by slow degrees an equal quantity of boilingwater into the vessel of sea water in which they were immersed He then separated each polypus with pincers from its shell and plunged each se∣parately into small chrystal vases filled with spirit  of wine mixed with water By this means the animal was preserved entire without having time to contract itself and he thus perceived a variety of kinds almost equal to that variety of productions which these little animals are seen to form He has been thus able to perceive and describe fifty different kinds each of which is seen to possess its own peculiar mode of con∣struction and to form a coraline that none of the rest can imitate It is true indeed than on every coraline substance there are a number of polypi found no way resembling those which are the erectors of the building these may be called a vagabond race of reptiles that are only intruders upon the labours of others and that take possession of habitations which they have neither art nor power to build for themselves But in general the same difference that subsists between the honeycomb of the bee and the paperlike cells of the wasp subsists between the different habitations of the coralmaking polypi  With regard to the various forms of these substances they have obtained different names from the nature of the animal that produced them or the likeness they bear to some well∣known object such as coralines fungimadrepores sponges astroites and keratophytes Tho'  these differ extremely in their outward appear∣ances yet they all are formed in the same manner by reptiles of various kinds and nature When examined chemically they all discover the marks of animal formation the corals as was said dissolve in acids the sponges burn with an odour strongly resembling that of burnt horn We are left somewhat at a loss with re∣gard to the precise manner in which this multi∣tude of cells which at last assume the appearance of a plant or flower are formed If we may be led in this subject by analogy it is most probable that the substance of coral is produced in the same manner that the shell of the snail grows round it these little reptiles are each possessed of a slimy matter which covers its body and this hardening as in the snail be∣comes an habitation exactly fitted to the body of the animal that is to reside in it several of these habitations being joined together form at length a considerable mass and as most ani∣mals are productive in proportion to their mi∣nuteness so these multiplying in a surprising degree at length form those extensive forests that cover the bottom of the deep  Thus all nature seems replete with life almost every plant on land has its surface co∣vered with millions of these minute creatures  of whose existence we are certain but of whose uses we are intirely ignorant while numbers of what seem plants at sea are not only the receptacles of insects but also en∣tirely of insect formation This might have led some late philosophers into an opinion that all nature was animated that every even the most inert mass of matter was en∣dued with life and sensation but wanted or∣gans to make those sensations perceptible to the observer Those opinions taken up at random are difficultly maintained and as difficultly refuted like combatants that meet in the dark each party may deal a thousand blows without ever reaching the adversary Those perhaps are wiser who view nature as she offers who without searching too deeply into the recesses in which she ultimately hides are contented to take her as she pre∣sents herself and storing their minds with effects rather than with causes instead of the embarrasment of systems about which few agree are contented with the history of appearances concerning which all mankind have but one opinion  FINIS  INDEX OF THE Various Matter contained in this Work
