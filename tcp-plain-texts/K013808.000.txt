 SOME THOUGHTS UPON THE SUBJECT OF Commerce with  FRANCE    BY The Author of the REVIEW  JOB  Suffer me that I may speak and after that I have spoken Mock on  LONDON Printed for  J BAKER  at the  BlackBoy  in  PaterNosterRow  Price  d    SOME THOUGHTS UPON THE SUBJECT OF Commerce with  FRANCE    I Could by no means foresee when I formerly publish'd my Thoughts about TRADE that it should come to be so popular a Controversy as it is now  I am very glad however as things have since hapned That as my Opinion of the Trade with  France  was always the same and for the same Reasons that it is now so that I did put that Opinion in Print so many times and so long  ago That I have left no room for Malice it self without shameful prevarication to Charge me with having Chang'd my Hand or my Heart in the matters of Trade The time will come when I shall make it appear as plain in other Matters also  Six Year and Nine Year ago and when the Ministry who then Govern'd Affairs had Lock'd and Bar'd all the Doors of Trade against  France  I ventur'd to tell them in so many Words That  Vide  Review Vol I and Vol IV Pa  if they had been in their Trading Sences they would have Traded with  France  all the while they Fought with  France I told them THEN plainly That we Cheated the Nation of the Profits of an Advantageous Trade by Prohibiting our  Lead  and our  Corn  going to  France  under the Weak and Foolish Pretence of not Supplying the Enemy with  Bullets  to shoot at us and not Supplying the Enemy with  Corn  for their Magazines when at the same time we sold both our  Lead  and our  Corn  to the Neuteral Powers who at a double Price sold them to  France  so that the Enemy got our  Lead  and our  Corn  for Bullets and Magazines  and we only Cheated our selves of the Profit  Vide  Review  Vol    I Complain'd THEN That the  Dutch  had the Wit to have an open Trade with  France  all the time of the War and became thereby able to carry on that War while at the same time they got from the  French  in Trade part of that Money they spent upon them in the Field whereas we shut our selves out of the Trade and the Profits too tho' we were able to get by it as well as they and wanted the Gain as much as they  I Published THEN in Print an Account of a Calculation of the Gain we made from  France  after the Peace of  Ryswick  when by the Opinion of some Eminent Merchants then and still flourishing in  London  and who can witness if they please on what foot this Calculation was made this Nation Cleared Pounds  per  Month by the Trade to  France  from whence came that wonderful Flux of  French  Pistoles among us which Suprised our People and Raised that ridiculous Clamour of the  OysterBarrel  and of their being  sent over to  Bribe our Parliament Men  The truth of which was nothing but this That our prodigious Export of Goods to  France  so much overballanc'd their Import upon us that they were oblig'd to supply the Ballance in Gold the Parliament was oblig'd to reduce the said Pistoles from  s    d  to  s  and the quantity was so great that if our Accounts at that time did not err above Eleven Hundred Thousand of them were Melted down at the  Tower  and Coin'd into Guineas  Vide  Review  Vol N    All these things Gentlemen I Printed in  The Review  there they stand as Witnesses for or against me if I have gone from my Opinion chang'd my Sentiments of things or Written against my self let it appear if I have not why am I Causelesly Bullyed and Insulted by vile Mercenaries and Ignorant Journeymen Scribblers whose Fathers as  Job  says were not fit to be set with Dogs of the Flock and who do it only because they think they please you in filling your Mouths with Scandal and Reproach  But further yet    These things tho' Written against the late Measures and in the time of a Whig Government They could hear then and not Dislike not Quarrel at or Insult me for Writing If the Ministry themselves found it clasht with their Proceedings yet they were always so Generous and so Just to me as to allow me a freedom of speech when I spoke my real Sentiments of things Believing that I spoke what I thought I had good Ground to Support and if they had not allowed me that Liberty I should have ventur'd their Displeasure and have taken it The Day being yet to come that I ever withheld Speaking what I thought was needful to say and what I knew I could Defend the Truth of for fear of any Man's Face or Power in the World Upon which Principle I still act as appears by my standing fast to my said Opinion in a Time when it procures me such a Tumult of popular Rage even among those who I thought had some reason to have used me better  But how comes it to pass that what I might say then with so much freedom I must not speak a Word of now Whence comes this Change of your Tast  I affirm and dare tell you I can prove to your Faces  Trade is the same  there is not one Addition or Alteration to any part of the Trade which does not more and more confirm what I said then and make it just to be said now How comes it to pass that a Man could be a WHIG and say this Four Five and Six year ago and must be a TORY if he says it  Now  What Gentlemen have you transferr'd your Reason and Judgment of things to the Tories Are the Tories come down to make the right judgment of Trade and are the Whigs gone from it you will not allow this sure What then can be the matter  I'll tell you plainly the matter and prove it when I have told it The  Partystrife  between the Gentlemen out of Power and the Gentlemen in Power has  Cursed be the Misfortune  hook'd in the Affair of Trade into the Quarrel and your Commerce is now become a part of your Politicks  The Consequence of the thing  unhappily for the Nation  is this That whatsoever part the Publick Managers take the private Party Managers oppose It has hapned that the Ministry have made a  Treaty of Commerce Immediately a lowd Cry is rais'd against Trading with  France  as if we were to continue the Interdiction of Commerce after the War was over and were still to have a War of Trade tho' the War of State was at an end Now if you please let the Tables be turn'd take it the other way Had the Ministry chosen the other part and made no Treaty of Commerce I undertake to prove that it had been the same thing and the same  LowdCry  had been raised and that by the very same People about Neglecting the matters of Trade and taking no Care when they made a Peace to open the Trade again as other of the Confederates had done for themselves  I am sorry to speak this Scandalous Truth But the Fact is so plain and can be so easily proved even upon Names and Sirnames of Persons and is already made so publick by other hands that my saying it will be no discovery  I have nothing to do here with any Remarks upon these Proceedings there will be a time for it but at present it shews us by what Means and for what Reason with what View and for what  End the Affair of Trade is Drag'd in  as it were  by the Hair of the Head into the miserable  Partystrife  which this Nation is Involv'd in  By this Means what I might have said Four year ago without any Reproach what I might Print then in the very teeth of a Ministry then in Power without Displeasing them is made  Party Treason  to be spoken now and that Liberty which I took even at the hazard of Displeasing the Government I must not be allow'd now lest it be a Service to the Government and all this by Tumult Rabble and Roaring not by Reason and Evidence  But Blessed be the Author of Truth that has made it Eternal like himself and as no Man ought to be AFRAID of speaking truth so no Wise Man will ever be ASHAM'D of speaking truth however unpopular and disobliging it may be or to the Damage of what Party of Men soever provided only that it be seasonable necessary Truth And such is this I am upon I am very sure of it  What has Trade to do with your Politick Squabbles and what Business have Party Men with the Commerce of  the Nation Trade is neither  Whig  nor  Tory Church  or  Dissenter HighChurch  or  LowChurch  In all the Broils and Tumults that have exercised these unhappy Nations about  Putting  IN and  Putting  OUT Trade has stood always Neuter till now There may have been Parties in the Parishes in the Wardmotes CommonCouncils and CommonHalls of the City and so upward to the PrivyCouncil Convocation and Parliament But we never till now brought them upon the  Exchange  there was never any  Whigwalk  and  Torywalk HighChurchwalk  and  LowChurchWalk  upon  Change  that ever I knew of till now  Certainly it is the Interest of the whole Nation to lay aside this part of the Strife Parties have ruin'd our Peace our Charity our Society already and almost our Religion too If we let them Ruin our Trade also What have we left Well may the poor People wear Wooll in their Hats when they go to Vote for Parliament Men I wish it may Direct them to chuse such Men as may put a speedy end to this Breach for if Parties come to Govern our Trade all our Commerce will be at an end  and by Consequence our Woollen Manufactures  We see it every Day and I believe neither Party will Deny it That the Heats on both sides are such among our Parties That as if they resolv'd to oppose one another in every thing Right or Wrong what one Party proposes however Rational and Just the other will oppose  only because these do it  and at another time the same Party shall espouse the very thing which they opposed and be the Authors and Promoters of it themselves Let the Passing Bills in Parliament prove this  Both Parties  have brought in the same Bills when they have been in  Power  which they have Voted against when brought in by the other Party in the time of  their  being in  Power Take the alternative  Both Parties have  Voted against  those Bills when they have been  out of Power  which they themselves have brought in when they have been  in Power  The Bills for quallifying Members for Excluding Officers for Regulating Elections the Triennial and the Occasional Bills are all Evidences of what I say  This is the present Case and when it will be otherwise God only knows But run to what Extremes you please and push your own Disasters as far as you please I am resolv'd in all I shall say on the Subject of Trade to speak of it as it ought to be spoken of  viz  as a thing entirely unconcern'd with Parties or with any of our Divisions whether it be  with  or  against  popular Opinion  with  or  against  those People who I hope mean well or  with  or  against  the Government or Ministry is not the question to me What I say now I said before I always said and say again  If we are in our Trading Senses we ought to open the Trade to  France and my Reason is the same as it was before neither the Trade or the Reason of the Trade has suffer'd the least alteration  We ought to carry on the  French  Trade because we are able to do it to our Advantage  and we who are a Nation depending upon Trade ought  to Trade with every Nation we can get Money by    I hope no body will think so grosly as to suppose that I should mean by this That we ought to Trade to  France  whether it be to our Advantage or no  It remains for me therefore to Examin next upon what foot of Trade we now stand with  France  and how it appears that the Trade may now be carried on to our Advantage  I have nothing to do here with the Question so much Canvass'd lately in Print between the Writers of both sides  viz  Whether the Trade to  France  was always to our Advantage or no I acknowledge I was always of Opinion that it was not I mean as to the Ballance of Trade I was bred to the  French  Trade from a Youth and have known my share of the Particulars of it and I know their Import was always very Heavy when our Duties upon them were Low our Gust to their Wines Brandy Silks and Fashions High and the Number of sorts of Goods Great which we dealt with them in  Yet I must own since I have seen what has been alledg'd on both sides I am more enclin'd to think that what has been said on that Side as to our former Advantage by the Trade is more probable than I thought it before and I crave leave for a small Digression to shew what has so enclin'd me Not that  I design to enter into the Dispute about it at all but meerly hint at what I have Observ'd in it which I had not Consider'd before  It must be allow'd that our Exportations to  France  in Woollen Manufactures were very great I will not enter into particulars here they are Publish'd on both sides many times over Besides the Woollen Goods our Allom Corn Fish Lead Shot CastIron Wrought Iron and Brass BlockTin Pewter Skins Druggs Coal but especially Leather rise up to very great Sums  Our Forreign Trade or what is call'd Exports by Certificate were likewise very great and oftentimes much greater than any of the Accounts I have yet seen Printed  viz  our Plantation Goods such as Sugars Cottons Indico Ginger Pimento Tobacco  c  Our  EastIndia Turkey  and  Spanish WestIndia  Goods as Cochenele Indico Gauls Dyers Woods CottonYarn Grograms Oyl  Spanish  Wooll as also Elephants Teeth Beeswax Drugs and the like  But if these are not allow'd to Balance the Imports from  France  as I say  again I thought always they did not yet the two following Circumstances which I borrow from another Publick hand do incline me to believe they might and this is all I shall say to what is past  These Circumstances are The Carrying on the whole Trade in our own Shipping the Advantage of which I must acknowledge The Advance of the Price of the Goods sent from hence to  France  which are for the most partsold upon the Account of the  English  Stocks  I have seen what is suggested by others on these Heads  viz  That the  French  are so encreased in Shipping that they will now bring their own Goods hither and that as much of the Trade is carried on by Commission from  France  hither as by Commission from hence to  France  which are to me of no force nor is it true in Fact The Drapers in  Cornhill  will readily testify in the Linen Trade which is the Case alledged That they always gave Commission to  Morlaix  for their  Dowlas  and  Lockrams    As to our Freight out being Carried for a small Matter it is true it was so in such Ships as went for Wines for what Goods they could get But as the Bulk of our Goods went to Ports which the Wine and Brandy did not come from and from Ports in  England  which the Wine and Brandy did not come to this cannot be the Case our Corn Coal and Lead goes chiefly to  Dunkirk Roan Diep  and other Ports of  Normandy  from whence no Wines are brought  But I am not Disputing with any body I am neither to Defend the  Mercator  or Confute the  British Merchant  let them fight on their own way I am giving my own Thoughts only which I shall do as Impartially as I can  I must Ingeniously acknowledge that I formerly received my Opinion of the Ballance of the  French  Trade being  l per An  to our Loss from the Accounts given then about Town and into Parliament when I my self was in Trade which made it be receiv'd at that time as a Common Opinion and as such I Printed it in the  Review  which some People are mighty well pleased to quote upon me now and this Common Opinion was Derived from the Paper which past for Current Truth in those Times called  A Scheme c  But I have really been amazed to see that Scheme detected of such manifest Fraud proved to be wholly false and designedly to be Imposed upon the Nation even to stripping it stark naked from all manner of  Covering and not one Word said in its Defence So that the Authors on that Side are careful to publish that they had no hand in it Vide  British Merchant  N Upon these things Can any man blame me then that I acknowledge the Error which I among other People fell into by taking that Account for True And that I am not now of the Opinion that the Trade to  France  was so much to our Loss as I then Printed it to be  These are the Circumstances which I say have enclin'd me to believe that our Trade to  France  fully Ballanced our Trade from  France  in former times  If any Man Suggests that private Ends and Advantages have byass'd my Opinion That Suggestion is False and Malicious I Contemn the Slander and Defy them to prove the least Circumstance of it  But the Face of things is now Chang'd the Trade looks quite another way ever since the first War and whatever it might be before it is certain that NOW the Trade to  France  must be to our Advantage and that prodigiously compar'd to what it was And this is the Reason that it has ever since that time been my stated Opinion and I have always Professed it and Printed it That it is our Wisdom to open the Trade to  France  for the time to come and nothing but Stupidity and a TradeMadness can prevent it This I say is the Reason for the alteration of my Opinion in that Case without the least private view or the least regard to who is for or against it  I cannot but think if Men were enclin'd to do me any Justice either in this or any thing else That my having Printed this as my Opinion several times and several years ago before any Parties concern'd themselves about it ought to Defend me against the Malice of those who suggest my doing it now upon the Influence of others But Reason and Justice are not Lowd enough to be heard in the Noise and Clamour of this Day Time will make Men Cooler and I must wait till then  The Question therefore now before us is very short and plain  viz  Whether it is our Interest to open a Trade to  France  And whether we shall be Gainers by it if we do it on the Terms of the Treaty of Commerce which is now proposed to us I shall speak only my own Thoughts of it  I have Examin'd as Nicely as I can the whole Treaty I will not say that several things might not have been added to it to make it more to our Advantage than it is But the question then will be Whether it was Rational to Expect greater Advantages could be submitted to by the  French  If indeed we had been Masters of  France  and had only one side of a Treaty to make  viz  to set down what Terms the  French  King should be obliged to yield to without Conceding any thing to them on our part then it should not have been a Treaty but an Act of Parliament Enacting in what manner the  French  should Trade with us as we do with  Ireland  which had it been our  Case I should have taxt the Ministry with great Indolence and Neglect of our Interest that they had not forb  d the  French  making any kind of Woollen Manufacture atall and taken off all Duties on the Importation of ours They should have caused all Woollen Manufactures from  Holland Flanders Germany Swisserland  c to have been Prohibited  c  They should have caused the  French  to send no more Ships to the  EastIndies Turkey  or  Canada  and have caused  Martinico  and  Quebec  to have been surrendred to us as they did  Newfoundland  and St  Christophers    I do acknowledg these are all Articles in which the Treaty of Commerce might have been made better than it is  They might also have Continued all the high Duties on  French  Goods in  England  as they now stand and which are in the nature of Prohibitions and made the whole Coast of  France  a Free Port to the  English  and many other things might have been done  But take the Treaty as a Convention between two Nations in which we were to provide for the Equity and Justice of Trade to settle the Equallities of Commerce between them with due regard to the Proportions of Things and the Circumstances of the respective Nations for the Accomodation of the Subjects of both and either Nation being Free and without Dependance upon the other I say if we take the Treaty thus as really it ought to be taken I must Confess and I must Speak my Mind freely and plainly whoever it offends I do not see how the Treaty could be made  between the two Nations upon more equal terms than it is if I did I should not be backward to speak it  Nay on the contrary I do think That the  French  King has struck such a blow by this Treaty to the Manufactures of Wooll among his own People that if he stands long to the Conditions of it all the Undertakers of Woollen Manufactures in  France  must be Ruin'd and Undone  It might indeed have taken away some of the Clamour at this Treaty if there had been some little Advantage given to the  Portugal  Wine Trade but when I remember how the  French  and the  Portugal  Trade stood formerly when I was concern'd in them both how the  Portuguese  Wines paid above Eight Pound  per  Ton Custom more than the  French  and that now the  French  are brought to an equallity I must allow that it is a large step in Favour of the  Portugal  Trade and what must necessarily leave the said  Portugal  Trade in a better Condition than it was in before the War  Nor can it be possible that what some People say on that Head can be true  viz  That the  Portuguese  will on the Breach of this Article esteem the Peace broke and will prohibit our Manufactures The People who Argue so discover that they know but little of the  Portugal  Trade the encrease of the  Portugal  Trade is known to all the World and the occasion of it also is known  viz  the Encrease of their Trade to the  Brasils  This is not only carried on with  English  Goods but with  English  Stocks also and the  English  Merchants of  Lisbon  send great quantities of  English  Goods to the  Brasils  upon Account and Risqs of the  English  Merchants at  London  and upon their own Accounts or else Trust the  Portuguese  Merchants with those Goods to receive their Effects at the Return of the Fleets from the  Brasils  so that without the help of the  English  Stocks as well as the  English  Goods it would be but a poor Trade that is carried on to the  Brasils    From hence it is easy to see that the Danger of Prohibiting our Woollen Manufactures in  Portugal  is of no consequence nor could they carry on the  Brasil  Trade or indeed their own Trade without our Goods nor have they much Reason to complain when upon a general Settlement of the Peace and Trade of  Europe  Trade should be left to run in the same Channel which it used to run in since they are put therein upon an even foot of Customs with the  French  whereas before they paid near  l per  Ton Custome more than the  French    I know the  Portuguese  have a Treaty in which another kind of Proportion is settled and much pains is taken to magnify the Sacred Obligation of this Treaty but such Treaties must all as the present Treaty is be subject to the Determination of Parliament otherwise it must be true as the  Mercator  has alledg'd That we shall give the Prerogative a Power which it does not pretend to and put it into the Hands of a single Agent Envoy or Plenipotentiary to Repeal Laws and Limit the Parliament of  Britain  as to what they shall  or shall not do and as to what Duties they shall or shall not continue if laid on or lay on anew which I acknowledge is an Authority Destructive of the whole  British  Constitution and inconsistent with the very being of Parliament  If a Treaty with  Portugal  is made which goes this length it is void in its own Nature and is no Treaty at all and if the present Ministry had made such a Treaty with  France  the Parliament would not have been bound by it and indeed could not without giving up the Peoples Liberties which they are entrusted with  These are indeed but my private Thoughts nor do I regard in them what has been said by others on this Head on either side I say it again All Treaties so far as they respect the laying on or taking off of those Duties and Taxes must be Subject to Parliamentary Authority or else we give up Parliaments to the Prerogative and revive that fatal Exercise of it the DISPENSING POWER which I hope never to see done in  Britain  especially by those who Espouse the Revolution Principle  Also such Treaties ought to be Subject to the General Treaty for settling the Tranquility of  Europe  and as it has been thought fit to make some alteration in that Treaty if the Parliament shall confirm those Alterations I cannot see that the King of  Portugal  ought to think it unjust because he ought to have considered when he made that Treaty whether the Persons did not Capitulate with  him for what they had no Power to make Good and if by the  English  Constitution they had not Power to make it Good he ought not to be offended that we do not give up that Constitution to oblige him I am sorry to see some People who a few Years past shew'd such commendable Zeal for the  British  Constitution be willing now to Sacrifice it to a Treaty whose Conditions made by a private Minister exceed the Power that either he really had or that they who employ'd him were able to give him  On the other hand That the King of  Portugal  shall immediately look on the Infraction of this Treaty as an Insult and a Breach of the Peace and the like and should thereupon prohibit our Manufactures of every kind which indeed is Prohibiting Commerce with us and consequently Declaring War This I cannot perswade my self of for this would be an open Defiance and I am satisfied the King of  Portugal  has too much Sense of the Equity of things to break with  England  on that account or if he should have so little Wit  England  may find Ways and Means to reduce the  Portuguese  to Reason and to resettle the Trade again to our Satisfaction or else  Portugal  is represented to be a much more Potent Prince than I take him to be The King of  Portugal  if the Debate about the Peace between him and  Spain  continue is like to stand in too much need of the Councils and Assistance which  Britain  is in condition to yield him I say too much to suffer him to break with  Britain  on so trivial an occasion  I cannot but think our People give too much weight to the  Portuguese  in this case and make the  Portugal  Nation seem to carry a greater Poise in the Ballance and Trade of  Europe  than their Circumstances allow making  England  so much oblig'd to the  Portuguese  as to be afraid of their Prohibiting our Trade as if they were not at all concern'd to have their Wine their Oyl and their Fruit shut out of  England  altho' they know if it should be so they are quite undone  I insist the less on this because I see it in debate by other hands but I must own I cannot but wonder to see People lay as it were the whole stress of their Arguments upon a Treaty with  Portugal  which if it should be granted to be so sacred would be a dreadful Precedent for this Nation in Giving up our Parliament our Privileges and our Constitution to the Power of the Ministry and enable them to tye up the Parliaments hands by whatever little Bargains they may make Abroad pretending that They the Court have agreed that it shall be so and so  I would calmly entreat such Men to reflect a little how oddly it would sound in the Ears of all the Ancient Patriots of the Revolution and the Defenders of  English  Liberty If they were now alive to have a Minister of State stand up in the House of Commons when a MoneyBill was before them and say Mr Speaker  "We cannot lay any farther Duty on such and such Goods from  Portugal  for her Majesty has made a Treaty to the Contrary And Mr Speaker  Her Majesty Commands you to lay such and such higher Duties upon and not to take off such and such Duties from  French  Goods for a Treaty is made that it shall be so"  Let us but compare this with the Language of our Constitution to be found in  Magna Charta  Sir  Ed Coke Bracton  and all the Writings of our best Lawyers and see whether this is not laying the Axe to the Root of Parliaments and Sapping the Foundations of the  English  Liberty and all this to give a Sanction to a Treaty which stands in no need of it and which if the worst comes to the worst ends in the Imaginary Resentment of a Power who is in no manner of Condition to quarrel with us This is a step I confess I never expected to see taken in  Britain  and it is really a Melancholly thing to see our People willinger to give up their Liberties and their Parliaments than the Court to take the Surrender  I shall make no farther Reflections on this Case We are to be very Thankful that our Liberties are fix'd and very Careful that we do not undermine them with our own hands  If the present Ministry had taken Mr  Methuen  for their Precedent and quoted my Lord  N  for their Authority and had absolutely stipulated with the King of  France  to take off such and such Duties  c  as by the Ninth Article of this present Treaty is Expressed and had not left it to the Determination of the Parliament to whom it belongs What would these People have said then And how might  the Ministry have referr'd them back to the  Portugal  Treaty for their Justification  These things Clear up to me the Objection against the Treaty of Commerce which is Drawn from the  Portugal  Treaty I do not by this resolve the Question Whether it is proper to break in upon this  Portugal  Treaty in order to make the present Treaty Effectual Let no Man mistake or strain my Words beyond what I lay down as my express meaning I shall speak to that by it self But I say this with respect to the whole Treaty with  Portugal  which I am not at all backward to declare my Opinion of and the Reasons for it  viz  That I think it cannot be justified Those who made it ought if they had been living to have answer'd for it  I come back to the main Subject and to my Reasons as above why I always was of the Opinion That we ought to have kept open our Trade with  France    viz  Because we could get by the Trade and that we ought to Trade with every Nation we can get Money by  I think I need spend no time to prove the latter  viz  That we ought to Trade with every Nation we can get Money by We are a Nation which Depends upon our Commerce and our whole Prosperity Wealth and Subsistance depends upon it the Landed Interest not excepted whose Rents would soon be reduc'd to such a Condition as to starve the Landlords as well as the Tenants a few of higher Dimensions than ordinary excepted if our Commerce should fail  This Commerce is supported and maintained principally by our Woollen Manufacture which is so Considerable and Essential to it that should we have no more a free Export or a Vent Abroad for our Manufactures the Import we make from Abroad would so overballance us from all parts of the World that we should immediately be exhausted of all our Specie and the other Produce of our Country would scarce feed us For this Reason nothing but a blindness which no Nation but ours was ever possessed with would have led us to be accessary to the stopping the Exportation of our own Manufactures as has been done by Prohibitions of Trade whether to  France  or to any other part of the World  I know it has been Objected That if we had not the  French  would To which I answer then the  French  should it was not our business to have done it first to Prohibit our own Goods because if we did not the  French  would is Dying for fear of Death and like a Man Hanging himself because he is in danger of being Condemn'd to be Hang'd  Our business had been to have Loaded the  French  Goods here with such Duties as might have secur'd their Importations from hurting us and to have left our Woollen Manufacture Free to be Carried to  France  or any where else as long as ever they would have bought a piece of them and if they must have been Prohibited it had been the King of  France  's business to have Prohibited them not ours It is our business to sell our Woollen Manufactures  to every body in the World that would buy them because the Produce of our Land the Labour of the Poor the Consumption of Foreign Imported Goods which are the Returns of them is all carried on by it and depends upon it In short we ought to Trade with every Nation we can Gain by because the Gain of our Trade is the Essential Article on which the Wealth of the Nation depends  Having lay'd down this Foundation it follows to prove that we can and may Gain by the Trade to  France  This must be proved by proving that the vallue of our Exportation to  France  with its Appendices and additional Circumstances shall exceed the vallue of our Imports from  France  and this is proved by two Circumstances which attend our Trade now which did not attend it before the War  The several Kinds of Manufactures which we are now Masters of and make either wholly or in Part among our selves which we formerly Imported from  France    The Loading the other Goods which we shall Import from  France  with such heavy Duties as must ntcessarily lessen their Consumption  There are other Reasons to be given of less moment but these are the Two main Reasons which will prove our Imports to be very considerably abated  There was no other Reason ever given or indeed could be given why we should not Trade with  France  but this That we Imported such unreasonable quantities of their Goods that infinitely overballanc'd what they took from us Whether this was so or not is not my question I have spoken of that before But whether it shall be so for the future  Let any Man inform himself how much in a probable Calculation of things that Consumption of  French  Goods will be lessened by the quantities of their several Manufactures which we make here and if he will be just he will find them very Considerable  They are under a very great Mistake who think the Wine and the Brandy are the only Considerable Articles which weighed down the Scale of Trade to the  French  side there were several single Articles which very much exceeded the Wine Trade  The Accounts which those who argue against this Trade shew to the World and which are publish'd in Print make the Linen Imported from  France  into  England  amount to Pound and they tell us the  Lockrams  and  Dowlass  alone amounted to by the same Account Three Hundred and Sixty Thousand Pounds the wrought Silks Imported in one year they make to amount to Three Hundred Thousand Pounds whereas by the same Account the  French  Wine is made to Amount to but Pounds and the Brandy amounts to but Pounds the Paper they say amounts to Pounds and the like  I am not Examining here whether these Accounts are true are not it is manifest they are not if they are false then they will not make out the Ballance which they are brought to prove if they are true they will Confirm the Argument I am upon For these Great and Capital Articles are all in a manner destroy'd and cannot be recover'd tho' the Treaty now in suspense should take place  The Silk Trade is gon the Importations of one Part  viz Alamodes  and  Lustrings  is entirely stopt the Weavers themselves gave it up before the House of Commons the Duty which is upon them and which must continue upon them is  l    per  C Weight and is so great as utterly Destroys the Trade not a Piece can be Imported to any Advantage and take away the Profit of a Trade you take away Trade there cannot a Piece be Sold here but what must be Run on Shoar by stealth and if we cannot prevent that it will be our own fault  The other part of the Silk Trade is reduc'd by Two things By the Improvements which our own Weavers have made in the BroadWeaving Trade which since the Encouragement given them by Prohibiting the Wearing of  EastIndia  Silk is so very great that the  French  can never outdo them By the Duty of  s per  Pound Weight which is still to remain upon the  French  Silks even by this Treaty Under both which Circumstances the Importation of  French  Wrought Silks will be very Low I know it  is Calculated in a publick Paper to amount to between Fourty and Fifty Thousand Pounds a Year but I have Reason to believe and am Confirm'd in my Judgment by Men of Experience in that Trade That it will be very little except what they may endeavour to get in privately by stealing the Duty which as I say above if we cannot hinder it will be our own fault  I might give many Reasons to prove that the Importation of Linen from  France  which is the princpal Article of their Importations will likewise be cut short and after having hinted the Encouragement given to the Linen Manufacture in  Ireland  the very great quantity of Course Tabling made in  Lancashire Westmoreland Durham  and  Yorkshire  the thin  Diapers  and other Linen brought now free of Duty from  Scotland  and the more than usual quantity of Course Linen made in several parts of  England  besides this I say itmay be observable that whereas  they say  we Imported Pieces of  Lockrams  and  Dowlass  from  France  in a Year there has not been Imported one Sixth Part of that Quantity one Year with another of  Hambro Dowlass  or of all the other kinds of Cloth which have been supposed to answer to the Uses which the  French  Linen was applied to this must evedently Demonstrate that the gross of the quantity is made at home  The Undertakers of the Manufacture of  SailCloth  in  England  and  Scotland  may answer for me how much they shall abate the Importation of  Vitre Pertree  and  Noyels Canvass    with which we used to be supplied from  France  for making of Sails and if they may be Credited they pretend to be able to make the whole Quantity to which purpose if the present Duties on the  French  are not high enough and will not give them an Advantage of the  French  sufficient to encourage and support their Work on their Representing the same to the Parliament no doubt they may have farther and higher Duties laid on from which the Parliament are not at all Limited or Restrain'd by this Treaty  I might go on to speak of other Articles as of the Paper the Encrease of Distilling the making of Glass and several other things all which joyn to lessen our Demand of Goods from  Franee  by the finding ways to supply the Consumption at Home But I think these are sufficient to answer for an abatement so Considerable as would make the Argument good seeing I am assured by those whose Judgment and Experience I esteem better than my own That we shall not Import in each of those two Heads  viz  the Silk and the Linen so much by a prodigious Sum as they have given an account of to have been formerly Imported  The laying on high Duties and those Duties lessening the Consumption of other Goods is the next Article and might take up some of our time here but I find it is spoken to by other Hands the thing is so natural none can deny it There cannot be the same quantity of Brandy Imported when it is to pay upwards of  l per  Ton Custom  as would be or was when it paid but  s  altho' the Distilling of Malt Spirits were not to be spoken of The like of the Wines  These are the Reasons on one Part why I think it will for ever be true that we may Trade with  France  to our Advantage  viz  That their Importations to us cannot be so great by a very great Sum as they usually were in the Days of King  Charles  II and King  James  II  I come now to the Exportation of  English  Goods to  France  and I must acknowledg that I go in this Part upon a Foundation which is to me very satisfactory tho' perhaps not Discern'd by every one that Considers it  Our Manufactures which formerly were loaded in  France  with Extravagant high Duties and at last with a total Prohibition are now to be Freely Imported into  France  paying no other Duties than as by the Tariff of which is about Ten  per Cent  and with a small Exception to the Woollen Clothes and ClothSerges which are to pay as by the Tariff of  This must let in our Manufactures into  France  in a full stream and open a Door for a greater Consumption of them in  France  than ever was before and this I say is the Reason on the other side why I pretend to prove we shall now be Gainers by the  French  Trade For if the only Exception against the Trade is that of their overballancing our Export if then I prove that their Export to us shall now Lessen and our Export to them shall now Encrease so that we shall for the future overballance them then my Argument must  be Good  viz  That we ought to Trade with them  It is brought as an Objection and it is all the Objection that can be brought in the Case  viz  That the  French  make all our Manufactures now as well as we do and therefore will not want ours any more Nay so warm are some People to have this believed that they affirm tho' I doubt without Evidence That they make as good Cloth in  France  as we do and as good Serges and Perpets  c  and in such Quantities to as that they can supply all the World nay and supply us to if we will give them leave  These Gentlemen beg the Question very peremptorily and Demand that we should strangely take them upon Trust But the matter of Fact has never yet been proved and this is not an Age to believe Men on their Words in things of such a nature when Parties byass Men so much to strain their Principles as we see is the Case every day  It has been ask'd in Publick by one Paper and I must ask it here it is so natural it cannot be strange if every Man we talk with should ask itWhere is this Fine Cloth and good Woollen Manufacture that the  French  make where do they hide it How comes it to pass that none of the Gentlemen who come over hither have any of it ON Let the  French  Ambassador be a Test of this or any other  French  Man that comes over look on their Clothes their Liveries their Coaches The  French  Ambassador cannot take it for an affront  that we say  an  English  Servant to a  private Gentleman would have thought himself very ill used to have been Clothed in such Trappings How Course How Rusty the Black How Spungy how Nappy and Rough the Clothes How ill made How worse Dress'd and How worst of all the Wooll of the Clothes they appear'd at first in The  English Colchester Bays  would have look'd better than some of them look'd If these are the Manufactures they boast of I shall never fear but when our Woollen Clothes Stuffs Serges and other Goods come among them at reasonable Rates for the Customs and Duties they will make their own way and shew the  French  that they are not able to make our Manufacture to any perfection  It is said by those who Object against it That they have our Wooll and have gotten Workmen from hence and their People Work Cheaper than ours can do and why should they not make our Manufactures as good as we do  This I desire to Explain upon a little and I shall leave my Opinion to the Judgment of those who are Impartial if any such are left among us as for those who will not judge Impartially who  will  have it be as they  would  have it be and that will admit no Argument but their own positive affirming a thing these Sheets shall not meddle with them nothing but Experience can deal with such and they are never Convinc'd till they are made asham'd  As to the  French  getting Wooll from  England  it is too true that they get great quantities of Wooll both from  England  and  Ireland    ever have done so and I doubt ever will do so How to have it prevented I do not undertake to say It is like the Distemper of the Gout in the Body which every Body has a Medicine for and no body can Cure  As to getting Workmen from  England I will not say but  That may be True also tho' we have not seen it proved take that with you too Traytors to their Country are always to be had who for a Morsel of Bread will do any thing and as there is no Law to punish them and they are out of reach also we must always be Content  But neither of these can come into the Partyquestion The Government can no more hinder Men going over to  France  to teach the Clothworkers how to Dress their Cloth than they can hinder Men going to List in Foreign Armies The New Ministry can no more hinder the Exporting of Wooll than the Old Ministry could I believe they would willingly hearken to any means that would be effectual and so would the last Ministry have done but both have been tyred with the Quacking of Projectors who have always Worried Innocent Men Conniv'd at Rogues and left the Disease worse than they found it  But I shall undertake to prove two things here that shall Confound all this Notion That neither the Workmen or the Wooll will effectually answer for making our Woollen Manufacture That neither the  French  or any Nation in the World do or can Work Cheaper than the  English  both can and do  From these Principles I insist upon it That the  French  cannot make our Woollen Manufactures so as to prevent the Sale of ours when a Trade shall be opened by taking off the Duties as by the Tariff of but that on the Contrary our Goods coming among them shall be so much better and in proportion to that goodness so much Cheaper that they shall in time destroy all their Undertakings of Woollen Manufacture and encrease the Consumption of ours On this account joyn'd to what I have said before it is that I say we may gain by the  French  Trade and is therefore another Reason why we ought to Trade with them  The Original or Foundation of the Manufacture is the Wooll the first step to the Working this Wooll is the Sorting Combing Carding and Preparing the Wooll The first  to wit  the Sorting the Wooll requires Judgment and Experience in the Master Clothier who must know what kind of Wooll is proper for every Manufacture From hence we find that in the Clothing Countries they throw by a great quantity of their Wooll as not proper for their Work and this is Carried out of those Countries to the Worsted Works and to the Comber again in the Stuffmaking Countries the Wooll which is not proper for them is pick'd out and laid by and carried out of their Countries to the Clothiers and the like of other Manufactures  This judgment perhaps may be carried over to  France  by such Vagabond Bankrupt Clothiers  and Combers as were not able to show their Heads at Home Necessity may tempt such to go Abroad As to the Carding Combing and Preparing the Wooll when Sorted That is a Road which any one may Teach them and which they perhaps may not want to Learn So that this is not the Point  The next Article is the Spinning and give me leave to say THIS as it is the Essential so it is the Inimitable part of our Manufacture and the  French  are utterly Unable to do this and we are Unable to Teach them They are so far from being able to Imitate the various sorts of Spinning which is now practiced in  England  that really we cannot Imitate our selves There is so much Evidence in this Truth and it is so well known and so prov'd by Experience That I freely appeal to all the Manufactures of  GreatBritain  for the proof of it  The Spinning generally speaking is the Work of the Women and Children it is Learn'd from Mother to Daughter as Birds Learn to Sing Cocks to Crow and little Children to Speak  viz  by Immediate Imitation The manner is carried from one to another by that aptness which is in the young of every Creature to follow the old and becomes a Natural Habit like a Tone in the Speech which is peculiar to this or that County which they  who use it  know not how to alter and they  that do not  know not how to imitate  Thus you may know the People who are Born and Bred in the several parts of this  Kingdom by the Shibboleth of the Place they come from they cannot Conceal it nor can a Man Born in another part of the Country Mimick them so but that he will easily be known to be a Counterfeit This is plain in the People of  Norfolk  and  Suffolk East Devon Somerset Wilts  and  Dorset West Lancashire NorthWest Yorkshire Durham  and  Northumberland North Scotland Wales  and several other parts  In like manner every way the same in its kind and introduc'd the same way  viz  by a meer habit and that not to be alter'd by themselves or imitated by others is the Manufacture of Spinning Naturalized to the People of the several Parts of  England  according to the several Countries they have been taught to Work in Nay even in the same Countries the Spinning differs as the several Manufactures which this or that part of the County are Employ'd in differs  The Consequence of this is Essential to the Manufacture whence proceeds the variety of our sorts of Goods which appears not at all according to the Nature of the Wooll but according to the different Places where it is Wrought the Reason of which is the Spinning and nothing else  A Proof of this is easily known by this Experiment take the Spinning of one County and carry it to be wrought into another County and for another kind of Goods than it uses to be wrought in the Defect shall presently appear in the Goods altho' for the Goods it was Spun for it was the best of its Kind that could be  Nay take the Spinning of one Town and carry it to another Town where the same Kind of Goods are made and it shall Work into that same sort of the Kind which were made in the Town from whence it came How comes it to pass That no Place in  England  can make the  Bays  but  Colchester  the  Says  but  Sudbury  the  Serges  but  Devonshire  the  Kerseys  but  Hallifax  the  Fine Whites  but  Gloucester  and  Worcestershire  the  Tamies  but  Coventry  the  Cantaloons  but at  Bristol  Nay of these Goods How come the several Species to differ so from one another Why cannot the Men of  Bocking  make as good  Bays  as at  Colchester  Why are the  Shaloons  in  Northamptonshire  better than those in the  West  Why the  Devon Kersies  better than the  Yorkshire  and that these Towns and Countries tho' they have or may have the same Wooll are not able with all their Skill to Imitate or Come up to one another  It is manifest that it is all in the Spinning whatever the Difference is it is hard to determine but that such a Difference is I affirm and I appeal to all the Manufacturers in  England  for the truth of it And this Difference runs thro' the whole Operation of the Manfacture that follows it like an Error in the first Concoction which is never mended in the second so an Error or a peculiar way in the first Spinning is never Corrected afterward but as is the Yarn such is the Stuff let it be of what Kind it will  Now this I say is impossible to be Carried into  France  The People there Spin and  perhaps may Spin Finer than ours and I believe they do but unless they Spin the same Kind of Threed for the same Kind of Manufacture that we do they can no more Imitate ours than one of our Towns or Counties can Imitate another  For Example Take a Woman that has been bred to Spin for the making of  Flannel  suppose from  Shropshire  and carry her into  Essex  and let her see how they Spin as much as she will and try as much as she can she shall no more Spin good Yarn for making a Piece of  Bays  or to  Sudbury  she shall no more Spin for their Work than the Spinners there can for her  Flannel  she can no more alter her Hand effectually than she can shake off her  Shropshire  Dialect from her Tongue and learn to Whine and Talk as they do in  Suffolk    How many attempts of this kind have been made in  England    viz  to Transplant the Manufacture of one County into another and we have very rarely found it practicable If then one County cannot Imitate another if one Town cannot Imitate another nay in some Goods one Manufacturer cannot Imitate another tho' they have all the same Materials too How should another Nation Imitate us  And what is the Reason that we find such Struggling such Envying such Quarrelling among our Manufacturers like tittle Parties in the Trade to get one another's Spinners away and to get this or that Town Spinning away but because the Goodness of a Manufacture always depends upon the Goodness of  the Spinning How comes this or that Clothiers Goods to be known at  BlackwellHall  and to be enquired for by his Name and by his Mark and to Sell better than his Neighbours and the like of other Goods but that he has better Spinners than his Neighbours  I might Dwell upon this Prove and Explain it by many Arguments and Examples but I believe every one who has any Experience of Trade will grant it  If then I say we cannot Imitate one another in our Manufactures where we have plenty of all Materials Choice of the Wooll and Experienc'd Workmen only by Reason of the Difference and Difficulty of the Spinning How shall a Foreign Nation adapt their Spinning to our Manufacture a Nation that have a great scarcity of Wooll and must mix several Kinds and the Wooll of several Nations together that have a scarcity of all other Materials and above all must take such Wild and Untaught Spinners as they can get  Nor will it Argue in this Case to say they can have Spinners from hence for I affirm the best Spinner in  England  cannot teach another to Spin as she Spins if ever the Learner had Spun any thing before but if she Teaches it must be young Children from Five year and upwards or some that had never touch'd a Wheel  When this is done this Teaching Spinner can Teach only to Spin as she Spun her self be it for whatsoever Species of Manufacture she was brought up to and I dare say that the Nation can very rarely shew a Spinner that can Spin very well a Yarn for more than one Kind of Manufacture so that by this Rule the  French  must get Spinners over to Teach their People Distinguisht by their Work for every kind of Manufacture we make  This is a Reason why the  French  cannot come up to our Manufacture and a Reason which I flatter my self cannot be answer'd  There is yet another thing which affects indeed some of our Manufactures only but so many of them and that so Considerable a part  viz  our Clothing that I believe it renders it Inimitable in any other Part of the World and this is the Water I have not time to Enlarge upon this but let the Men of  Stroud water  in  Gloucestershire  be the Standard and let us see any  other Part of this Nation come up to them and then we may suggest that other Nations may also do it  This would take up a Tract by it self to Explain and to Examin the Reasons why one Kind of Water should be better than another for Dressing Milling Washing as well as Dying and why tho' the  Dutch  or  French  were able to fix brighter and better Colours than we can yet the Wooll it self shall not work so kindly the Nap of the Cloth rise so well nor the Shearer work so close with the Dressing in one Water as it shall in another and for this Reason the Clothiers in some Parts Carry their Goods many Miles to these or those Fulling Mills when there are others nearer home  I am so near the Close of this Tract that I cannot Enlarge but I come to another Case in our Manufacture wherein I find we are run down by a Vulgar Error which however at this time is made mighty Use of and makes more Noise than is for our Reputation especially as it comes out of our own Mouths and this is That the  French  People Work Cheaper than we nay so great is the assurance which our People speak it with that they are not slack to say that they can Work Cheaper by Four pence in a Shilling  I am bold to say such Discourse is enough to Convince any Man that understands Manufacturing that the People who speak it either say it without knowledge or against knowledge I am afraid it is the latter  Could the Poor in  France  Work Cheaper than the  English  by a Groat in a Shilling could the Spinner the Weaver the Carder the Dresser the Dyer  c  perform all those Works which are at the beginning of the Manufacture Fourpence in a Shilling Cheaper than the  English  the Clothier that finishes it would be able to Sell it Eight pence in the Shilling Cheaper when it was finished for that Difference in the first Work would double in the Price of the whole Cloth and so the Clothes which the  English  could not Sell under Twelve Shillings  per  Yard at Market the  French  would sell at Four Shillings  per  Yard and of Consequence must of Necessity have long ago had all the Trade of the World  As this tho' but a short hint is sufficient to Expose the falshood of that Suggestion so I shall lay one thing down as a certain Truth which I know to be True of my own certain knowledg in many Cases and offer to prove by good Evidence in others and I shall leave it to farther Enlargement if I am call'd to speak to it again The Assertion is this in short  That set the Goodness and Quantity of their Work against their Wages and no Nation in the World Works Cheaper than the  English    Let no Man suggest that this cannot be made out my Name is to this Book I'll make it good and at any reasonable Hazard I offer to prove it beyond the power of all the Cavils of the World Take it in any or all the Branches or Parts of the Woollen Manufacture I repeat it again in other Words  Set the goodness of the Performance and the quantity of Work done against the Wages  no Manufacturers in the World have their Work done Cheaper or for for less Wages than the  English    I do not deny but in Diligence they may outdo us I know the  English  Poor are not so forward to Work as the  French  and perhaps when the  English  have earn'd their Money hardly they may spend it lightlier than others and be as poor as any of them  I know that if you higher a  Frenchman  by the Day he shall come at less Wages  I know if the  French man  Works for himself he shall sit to it more hours  But then the  English Day Man  shall do more Work in less time  Or the  English Day Man  shall make better Work  And the  Englishman that Works for himself  shall perform as much in less time than the  Frenchman  or make his Work Deserve more Wages  I appeal to  Spittle fields  for the Truth of this in part and even to the  French  Manufacturers there themselves  Had I room here I should produce Experiments which I have made of the  English  Manufacturing against  Frenchmen Dutchmen Scotsmen  and others I can prove in them all that we Work much Cheaper  than any People in the World allow Weight for Inches as the Jockies call it and I am not at all partial to my own Country in it neither But I cannot Enlarge upon this Subject  CONCLUSION  THese are my Reasons why I think we are sure to Gain by the  French  Trade and I have set them down with as much Clearness and Impartiallity as I can and altho' the Treatment I receive from the World at this time might be justly allowed to move me I have done it Calmly and without any of the Rudeness which these things are now debated with Yet I cannot but say that I am Injuriously dealt with in these matters every Man has a right to Think of these things as his Reason Experience and Judgment Dictates and I do not know any Law that forbids him making that Opinion publick  But I must Complain of a Treatment which I Confess I never saw given to any Man but my self in this Nation I am Treated by the Writers of the Town as if it was Criminal in me to give my Opinion because it differs from theirs and with the utmost Fury and Scurtillity I am Treated as one that had lost my  English  Liberty and ought not to have freedom of Speech allow'd me  When other People Publish Pamphlets and Papers which Argue against these Men these Answer them upon me they adventure upon the meer Guess at Language to call me the Author of any thing they do not like tho' oftentimes I not only have not been the Author but the first knowledge I have had of the thing has been when I have seen my self Insolently Treated for Writing it  I lay'd down the  Review  because my thoughts of things did not agree with the present Opinion of those People for whom I had so much Respect that I was weary of differing with them and in the last which I Publish'd I hinted my Design of Going Abroad to be out of the reach of this Clamour as soon as publick  Obligations would allow me I am fallen upon by the scurrilous Writer of the  FlyingPost  as a Cheat because I am not gone abroad and yet he knows I am under Bail not to stir and that Running from my Bail has not been any part of my Practice  Whether I am Concern'd or no I am dayly Insulted and told That I am not to be Treated with Decency have the LYE given me in Print by Men that do not think fit to let me know their Names or to give me leave to ask them whether they will do it to my Face or no  Persecution has been Condemned by all Sides as an Unchristian Practice but if Causeless Slander be not a Cruelty worse than Death and the Persecution of the Tongue be not the worst Kind of Persecution let any Impartial Man judge  Under all this Treatment I arm my self with Patience and Desire to Return these Men no Evil for their Evil I have Ruin'd my Family in the Service of the People who I find now so Angry and because I could not Desert them Suffer'd all that the Rage of their Enemies could inflict and I have liv'd to see those very People Reproach me with that Suffering and that Fidelity which they once acknowledg'd was a Service to them is it seems now my Infamy Whether my Suffering merited their Thanks at that time I do not determine but sure it could not merit Thanks then and their Reproach now I appeal to themselves  But be all these things as he shall Direct who Governs the World and God be praised these Men are not to be my Judges at last In the mean time If I am not allow'd to give my Opinion in Things which no Law prescribes me in Where then is Justice where Charity where  English  Liberty and how do these men shew themselves Tyrants even of the worst Kind who would deprive a Man of his Liberty of Speech because he does not say what they approve of  It is my satisfaction that I am hitherto pursuing no end but what I firmly believe to be the True Interest of my Country and I am fully perswaded that even  the People who are at this time so Warm will in a few years be Convinc'd they are in the wrong and be asham'd of those Men who now endeavour to Enflame and Exasperate us one against another In the mean time I have here given my Reasons for my present Opinion relating to the Trade with  France  which I have done rather as a Testimony to future Times of the Foundation upon which my said Opinion is grounded and to Answer the Calumnies of those People who Malign and without provocation Insult me than from any prospect I have that the soundest Reasoning will allay the Ferment which the Parties among us have unhappily put the Nation into  I make no question in its proper time to clear my self likewise from the Charge of having  Chang'd Sides  in OTHER matters and to bring some People to acknowledge they do me Injustice in the Treatment they now give me but the ferment is too great for Reason to take place and I am content to suffer the Injury till it shall please Him that Guides the World to give me an Occasion to do my self Justice  But in Matters of Trade I think now is the time to speakA Trade with  France  or no Trade with  France  is now the question I have first to remove Scandal proved to you what my Opinion was of the  French  Trade formerly and what I said then about it and now I have offer'd my present Opinion if then what I say now of it is no more than what I said formerly it will hardly pass with any Reasonable Man That I am Chang'd unless to Change and to be the Same be proved to be  One part of Speech    God deliver this Kingdom from the Dreadful Consequences which our Blessed Saviour says must follow a Nation Divided against it self  FINIS
