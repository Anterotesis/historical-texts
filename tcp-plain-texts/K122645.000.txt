 AN ESSAY ON THE SURETISHIP OF CHRIST  IN TWO PARTS  PART I The Doctrine stated  PART II Objections answered  By Samuel Richardson  By so much was JESUS made a SURETY of a better Testament  Heb  vii  CHESTER Printed by C W LEADBEATER for the Author AND SOLD BY W BUTTON PaternosterRow T KNOTT LombardStreet London LEADBEATER and the AUTHOR Chester MORRISSON Perth and GILLIES Glasgow PRICE s  PREFACE  ALTHOUGH the following Essay originated in a private controversy that is a controversy carried on for some time in private between the Church of which I am a member and some other Churches of the same denomination and although I am in some measure sensible of my literary defects yet something may be said by way of apology for my appearing thus in print  We have no other way of communicating our sentiments to all who are concerned in this controversy  Some who were not immediately concerned herein have heard of the dispute and our sentiments have been so much misunderstood that it seems necessary to rectify these mistakes The SUBJECT in debate is in our estimation of infinite importance and of universal concernment and therefore I have not confined myself to the question as it stood amongst ourselves but have endeavoured to treat it in such a manner as to make this Essay equally interesting and useful to all who read it Although the truth of Christianity  in general  has been supported with ability and success against the bold attack made by Mr Thomas Paine  yet I have not met with any thing which I could esteem as a sufficient reply to the argument he has urged against that grand peculiarity of the Gospel  the doctrine of Redemption  I have therefore attempted something in that way I am in hopes that if there should seem a necessity for it this little Essay may give occasion to some more able Friend to take up his penFor the rest I can only say to the  Critic  Spare mebut to the  Deist Jew  or  Christian  I saySpare notSo much by way of Apology  I have used very freely every thing I found to my purpose in human Authors but I never rest any part of the argument upon their  Authority  They frequently helped me to express my own thoughts with more ease and clearness than I could otherwise have done and therefore I used their Words but so far am I from building upon the authority of their Names that I differ widely from almost all of them upon other mattersThe Age of Popery is gone let every man now exercise  his own  reasoning Powers and  "be fully persuaded in  his own  mind"  But although I reject all human authority in matters of a  religious  nature I have so frequently referred to the Authority of Revelation that I fear the reader will not have patience to examine the Sacred Text yet it is  what he ought to do  As to that part of the book which is controversial I can only say I hope I have neither misrepresented the sentiments nor abused the person of any man The replies I have made and the proofs I have advanced appear to me to be conclusive and I am fully satisfied that the doctrine we maintain is the most just to God and the most safe to man that can be imagined But I do not expect that every one else will be thus minded When we do not like a sentiment it is easy to misrepresent it to ourselves and others we can start objections and refuse to be satisfied and as to scripture texts we can  either find a different sense for the words as they stand or we can alter the translation At least we may darken or perplex the question so as to make it a matter of doubtful disputation which therefore ought not to be insisted upon For instance  Some perhaps may sayWhat a piece of work is here about a single word Christ is called a  Surety  only once in all the Bible and even then he is not said to be the Surety of  Sinners  but the Surety of a  Testament  Yet here is a book written upon the Suretiship of ChristI shall conclude the Preface with a reply to this  Although Christ is only  once  expressly called a Surety yet since it  is GOD who calls him so we are absolutely certain that Christ does sustain this Character We do not find that it was said to Adam any more than  once    "On the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die"  Was the threatening less certain or of less importance I might multiply instances of this kind The word  Atonement  occurs but  once  in the New Testament but the thing intended thereby is often mentioned so it is with respect to the Suretiship of Christ  As to the word  Testament  it will be granted that it is of the same import in this place as the word  Covenant  See Mr M'Lean's treatise on the Apostolic Commission p  Now as this is certainly a covenant  between GOD and  man  Christ must be the Surety of  sinners  for the following reasons  "EGGUS  or  EGGUHTHS  A Surety  is one that undertaketh for another wherein he is  defective  really or in reputation Whatever the undertaking be whether in words or promise or in depositing a real security in the hands of an arbitrator or by any other personal engagement of life and body it respects the  defect  of the person for whom any one becomes a surety Such an one is  sponsor  or  fidejussor  in all good authors and common use of speech And if any one be of absolute credit himself and of a reputation very unquestionable there is  no need of a surety unless in case of mortality The words of a surety in the behalf of another whose ability or reputation is dubious are  ad me recipio faciet aut faciam  "I take the matter upon me he shall do it or I will"  God therefore can have  no surety  properly because there can be no conceiveable  defect  on his part There may be indeed a question whether any words or promise be  his  but to assure us of that is not the work of a surety but of  any means  whatever that may give  evidence  that it is so He doth indeed make use of  witnesses  to confirm his word that is to testify that he hath made such promises but the  difference is wide enough between a  witness  and a  surety  for the latter must be of  more ability  or more credit and reputation than he for whom he engages or there is no need of his suretiship This none can be for GodAnd if this be not the notion of a surety in this place the apostle makes use of a word no where else used in the whole scripture to teach us that which it doth never signify among men which is sufficiently improbable and absurd For the sole reason why he made use of it was that from the nature and notion of it among men in other cases we may understand what he ascribes under that name to the Lord Jesus"  "We on all accounts  stand in need of a Surety  for us or on our behalf Neither without the interposition of such a Surety could any Covenant between God and us be firm and stable or an  everlasting Covenant  ordered in all things and sure In the first Covenant made with  Adam  there was no Surety but God and men were the immediate Covenanters And although we were then in a state and condition able to perform and answer all the Terms of the Covenant yet was it broken and disannulled If this came to pass by the failure of the  Promise  of God it was necessary that on the making of a new Covenant he  should have a Surety  to undertake for  him that the Covenant might be stable and everlasting But this is false and blasphemous to imagine It was  man alone  who sailed and broke that Covenant Wherefore it was necessary that upon the making of the  New Covenant  and that with a design and purpose that it should  never be disannulled  as the former was that we should have a  Surety  and undertaker for us For if that  first Covenant  was not firm and stable because there was no  Surety  to undertake for us notwithstanding all that Ability which we had to answer the terms of it how much less can any other be so now our Natures are become depraved and sinful Wherefore we  alone were  capable of a Surety  properly so called we alone  stood in need of  him and without him the Covenant could not be firm and inviolate on our parts The Surety therefore of this Covenant is so with God for us  "It is the  Priesthood of Christ  that the Apostle treats of in this place and that alone Wherefore seeing the Lord Christ is the Surety of the Covenant  as a priest  and all the sacerdotal actings of Christ have God for their  immediate object  and are performed with him on our behalf he was  properly  A SURETY FOR US"  DR OWEN  The following pages are designed to state and defend that work which Christ performed in the capacity of a SURETY I have attempted to prove that he acted in this capacity from his infancy to his death in obeying the commandments and suffering the penalty of the Moral Law This is the DOCTRINE however expressed which these lines are intended to maintain I contend not about particular words or modes of expression THE TRUTH ITSELF and not any particular mode of expressing it is that which I labour to defend Neither is it every particular  circumstance  attending the life death resurrection and ascension of Christ as they are  stated in this Essay which I contend for I have mentioned these circumstances as I found them or as I think I found them in the scriptures and that for the sake of illustration but they are not all  essential  to the main point as expressed aboveTherefore if any one should think it his duty to animadvert upon this Essay let him not spend his time in cavilling at meer expressions or circumstances but attend to the main Doctrine in question  Chester    Dec    S Richardson  AN ESSAY ON THE SURETISHIP OF CHRIST  PART I The Doctrine stated  SECTION I On the state of Man by Nature  I Take it for granted that there is a GOD who presides over the universe and takes notice of the moral actions of men and consequently that there is a future state of rewards and punishments of happiness and misery It is also reasonable to believe that the MORAL LAW delivered by Moses and continued as a rule of life to Christians under the New Testament dispensation is in  fubstance the very same law which naturally binds all men and by which God will judge the world This law dictates to us our duty towards God and man It also promises happiness to the obedient and condemns the sinner  The moral law requires that we love the only true God with all our heart soul mind and strength this is the first and great commandment The second is like unto it namely Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself Upon these two commandments hang all the law  Mat  Whatsoever flows naturally from this principle of love is a part of the moral law  Rom  and is binding upon all mankind  Rom  This law is enforced by a promise and a threatning If thou wilt  enter into life keep the Commandments  Mat  Rom  but cursed is every one who continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them  Gal  To be bound  upon these terms  to keep the commandments is what the Scriptures usually intend by the expression  "  under the law  "  Rom Chap  All men are by nature under this law The heathen nations who had not this law as delivered by Moses were nevertheless bound by it as it is made known by the light of nature All mankind lunaticks idiots and infants excepted may and actually do know enough of this law to constitute them sinners and leave them without excuse when they act contrary to it  In speaking of a law of nature we have no occasion to strive with Philosophers  about what they call  innate ideas  Equally impertinent would it be to enquire what impressions of duty men would have had if they were otherwise framed and situated than what they are that is if they were not every where surrounded with the visible works of their Creator if they were not furnished with powers of body and mind suited to perceive these works and if they had not been made Male and Female Parents Children Brethren c Taking men as they are it is evident they are abundantly furnished with the means of knowledge to render them accountable to their maker for all their ways  That which may be known of God says Paul is manifest unto men for God hath shewed it unto them For the invisible things of Him from the  creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and Godhead so that they are without excuse  Rom  It can do nothing toward invalidating these words of Scripture to recount the many absurd notions of the heathen concerning the number and quality of their gods because nothing more absurd has been either thought or done by them in regard to religion than what has been done by those who have lived under the superior light of revelation If Transubstantiation cannot prove that we are without a Bible no more can idolatry prove that the heathen are without a law of nature  Having shewed that the heathens transgressed the first part of the law our duty toward God the Apostle proceeds to speak of those things  which regard man and man And here speaking of the propensity bebetween the different sexes which stands at the head of all other relations among mankind he calls it  natural  and a similar propensity between those of the same sex he calls  unnatural  Rom  therefore highly criminal Is any other argument necessary to evince its criminality beside an appeal to the human breast I hope notIn like manner the other relations formed by nature between parents and their offspring between children of the fame parents c demand suitable affection and behavour and to counteract that affecton is to act an  unnatural  part Indeed the scriptures every where appeal to the human breast as fixing the law of natural affection ThusCan a woman forget her sucking child  Isa  Ye being  evil know how to give good gifts to your children  Mat  Like as a father pitieth his children  Psal  c c Remarkable are the words of Paul Rom Here he says that the Gentiles who had not the written law of Moses were nevertheless a law unto themselves He says they did the work of the law  by nature  which shewed it written in their hearts not indeed by perfect  obedience  to it but as he says by their mutual accusations and excuses touching the breaches of it In this sense we see many in our own days doing the work of the law even while they are in the act of disobeying it We can see the most infamous characters amongst men accusing each other and by their rapid exchange of the odious terms  drunkard whore thief lyar ungrateful  c  we see them very quick sighted and very capable of doing that work of the law which consists in condemning the guilty Now Paul says they did this in his days  by nature  Moreover  The Apostle shews not only that the heathen had a sense of right and wrong but also that they knew the judgment of God against sinners  Rom  And when we consider how universally  sacrifices  prevailed amongst the heathen nations we see Paul's testimony corroborated and we may conclude that a dread of future punishment ever haunts the guilty breast in a greater or less degree  There are two opposite extremes which some men run into upon this subject Some deny the very existence of the law of nature whilst  others contend for it's sufficiency to bring  fallen  man to happiness Both parties are wrong The law points out our duty finds us guilty condemns us and there it leaves us  When we read the history of all times and nationswhen we consider what daily passes before our own eyes and in our own breasts we find a melancholy proof of the scripture doctrine concerning our depraved state The most renowned of the heathen Philosophers  Socrates  died in the prosession of idolatry  See  Rollin's Ancient History  the chief man  Paul  in the strictest sect among the Jews was found disaffected to the true character of God  Tim  and christians unanimously say  "In many things we all offend"  James  How then shall man be just with God Hail thou SUN of RIGHTEOUSNESS  From the gloom of guilt and despair we turn our eyes toward thy chearing beams  SECTION II On the UNION between Christ and his people  IF in tracing the lowly steps of Immanuel from Bethlehem to Calvary we should view him as a single individual acting for himself alone much of the beauty of his sacred history would be lost To guard against this it may be useful to take some notice in this place of the unity or oneness of Christ and his Elect The inspired writers speak much of this union and illustrate it in a variety of ways  This union was foreordainedit was fixed upon in the Divine mind  before the foundation of the world see Ephesians Chap throughout  This union began to appear under the Old Testament dispensation It was prefigured by various types even from the Creation downward Adam and Eve  Gen  Eph  Every HighPriest who bore the names of the twelve tribes upon his shoulders and on his breast  Exod  Every animal sacrificed  in the people's stead  Gen  all these prefigured among other things the union of Christ and his people The Temple itself appears to have been a Type of Christ in such a sense as to comprehend his people  John  Eph  Nor did this union appear to saints of old only in types and shadows The spirit of Christ was in his people even before he came in the flesh  Pet  and this spirit  by testifying of Christ fixed the faith hope and love of the saints in him  John  Heb  It is true that there is something  peculiar  in the gift of the divine spirit under the New Testament dispensation nevertheless the saints of old were not destitute of this amazing gift  This union between Christ and his Elect was drawn still closer when the divine Word was made flesh and dwelt among us  John  For verily he took not on him the nature of Angels but he took on him the seed of Abraham At this time and in this way the Eternal WORD became the SON of God  Luke  and the BROTHER of all Gods' children Thus he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified by him are all of one Father for which cause he is not ashamed to call them his  Brethren  Heb  Adam was created the Foederal Head of his posterityhe stood as our representative and we were all in his loins So long as  He  obeyed  We  obeyed in him and when  He  sell  We  also sell in him This union prefigured that of Christ and his people  Rom  This union is compared with that which subsists between the Root Stock and Branches of a Tree  John  and with the union which is formed between the Foundation CornerStone and superstructure of an Edifice  Eph  and with the union which subsists between a Husband and Wife particularly that of Adam and Eve Upon this account we are said to be members of his body of his flesh and of his bones  Eph  Another union largely insisted upon in the word of God is  that which we see between the Head and members of one and the same living Body  Eph  Cor  where One Spirit animates all the members and governs every motion of the bodyThis last comparison seems to carry the Union of Christ with his people to the greatest possible perfectionit approaches to the idea of personal identity Indeed the Spirit of Christ dwelling in and informing and actuating all the members of his body the church forms such a wonderful union between him and them that he compares it to the Oneness of the Father and the Son  John  To the idea of union we must add that of a SURETY  Heb  A surety we all know is a Bondsman or one who gives security for another so that if  the debtor himself fails his surety must pay his debts  Prov  The debt we owe to God considered as his  creatures  is a perfect and continued obedience to all his righteous commandments but as we are not only creatures but  sinners  therefore justice has another demand viz satisfaction or atonement for the sin committedIf we carry the sentiments of this Section in our minds the next will appear more beautiful and interesting  SECTION III A summary view of that important Work in which every jot and tittle precept and penalty of the Moral Law are amply fulfilled in our Divine Surety  WHEN our first parents had sinned and thereby forfeited the divine favour and brought misery and death into the world then divine mercy began to unfold itself  The Seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head  Gen  was the first gracious promise to sinful man Sacrifices also were immediately appointed which served to cast light upon this obscure promise  Although this light was small when compared with ours yet it was sufficient to give hope to the guilty and we know not how far the spirit of Christ might open their understandings to comprehend it's import Certainly when they saw a Lamb sacrificed in their stead and their shame and nakedness which sin had discovered hid by the natural cloathing of the slaughtered victim  Gen  they might comprehend something of the true intent of the Promise and Paul informs us that it was by  Faith  Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than Cain  Heb  At sundry times and in divers manners  Heb  this first promise was repeated and further explained the light increasing more and more as the time advanced At length Daniel fixed the time for the Messiah's appearance and  told his nation plainly what their long expected Deliverer was to do viz Make reconciliation for iniquity and bring in everlasting Righteousness  Dan  When the fulness of the time was come God sent forth his Son made of a Woman made under the law to redeem  Gal  At eight days old he was circumcised  Luke  thereby intimating that he became a debtor to do the whole law  Gal  At twelve years old he speaks of being about his Faher's business and he speaks of this in such a manner as implies that he had been so employed before this time He mentions it as a thing which ought to have been so well known to Mary and Joseph as to have prevented that sorrow with which they sought and that amazement with which they found him  "  How  is it that ye sought me  "  said he  "  Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business  "  Luke  But although the Child Jesus was perfectly acquainted with his own divinity and although he was able to astonish all who heard him yet he went down to Nazareth with Joseph and Mary and was subject unto them  Luke  In this state he spent the first thirty years of his life  Luke  During which time it does not appear that he wrought any miracle or manifested forth his glory  John  Joseph was a Carpenter and there is reason to believe that the Son of the Highest worked at that trade earning his bread like a poor labouring man for he is called not only the Carpenter's Son but the Carpenter  Mark  Every period of the Redeemer's life has a glory peculiar to itself A certain  Author very properly observes We are apt not to have high enough thoughts of the glory of Christ's private life yea it is impossible for us to have high enough thoughts of it The peculiar glory of this part of his work consisted in it's obscurity which set an eternal brightness upon holiness upon every Duty and act of submission and obedience to God  Another Writer with less wisdom says  "As it hath seemed good to the wisdom of the Holy Spirit to be  very sparing  in the history of his private life we must be contented to remain in ignorance of what is not revealed"  That every thing which Jesus said and did is not revealed to us is readily granted but this is true not only of his private but also of his public life  John  The history of his private  life is indeed given in  few words  but it should be considered that few words are sufficient to record the history of a poor working man in whose days there might be very little  variety  The disappointment which some men discover in finding so little said in Scripture upon this period of our Suretie's life seems to proceed upon the supposition that his private life was more adorned and diversified with those shining acts which glitter in the eyes of men and commonly excite their admiration and applause than we have any account of in scripture and perhaps this way of thinking has it's foundation in the old jewish prejudice that it was inconsistent with the character of the Messiah to be a poor Carpenter But those who see the necssity of our Suretie's obedience to the moral Law or eternal rule of Righteousness  will rejoice to find him thus employedto find him spending thirty years of his humiliation in doing little else than fulfilling that law in a family connection and in that low and laborious situation to which the original curse had reduced fallen man  Gen  Those who view Immanuel in all this acting as our Suretydischarging the very debt in which we were involved will see a peculiar beauty and feel inexpressible satisfaction in the whole They will be ready to adopt the language of Paul  "We know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ who though he was rich for our sakes he became poor that we through his poverty might be made rich"  Cor  At length the scene changesJesus quits his obscurity and enters public life  "Then cometh Jesus from Galilee  to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him but John forbad him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me And Jesus answering said unto him Suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all Righteousness Then he suffered him And Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and Lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and it lighted upon him and Lo a voice from heaven saying THIS IS MY BELOVED SON IN WHOM I AM WELL PLEASED"  Mat  The Son of God being thus announced an universal terror pervades the infernallegions  Mark Chap  and men join with devils to resist the sinner's Friend  John  Nevertheless he is obeyed whether  willingly or by constraint by all sorts of beings The winds and seas and the inhabitants of the deep attend his word  Mat Chap  John  evil Spirits abandon their human habitations  Mat  diseases of all sorts fly at his command  Mat  he gives the Word and thousands of hungry men are filled with a handful of bread  Mat Chap  the blind see the lame walk the deaf hear the dead are raised and the poor have the GOSPEL preached unto them  Luke  Thus our Surety  "went about doing Good"  Acts  yet in the midst of all he himself continues poor a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief  Isa  He continues poor  He appears to have subsisted upon what some of his disciples were pleased to give him  Luke  but  so deficient were these supplies that he has been obliged to work a miracle for tribute money  Mat  and we find him at times destitute of a place to lay his head  Mat  Despised and rejected of men  The few indeed who saw his glory as the glory of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth  John  worshipped him as their Lord and their God  Mat Chap Chap and and and  Luke  John Chap  as do the whole Church  Psalms  Acts  Cor  and all the Angels in heaven  Heb  Rev  yet even among these he acted as a servant  Luke  and washed his disciple's feet  John  But the chief of the jewish nation were continually reproaching him and thirsting for his blood He was reproached as a glutton and Drunkard  a friend of publicans and sinners  Mat  he was called a deceiver  John  Mat  a madman  John Chap  a samaritan and possessed of a Devil  John Chap  they called him a blasphemer  John  and excommunicated all who owned him as the Messiah  John Chap  several times they attempted to stone him  John Chap and  and once they led him to a precipice intending to dash him to pieces  Luke  A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief  Although Jesus Christ endured all his suffering with more than the patience of Job yet he was not insensible or void of feeling One of those Psalms  Psalm  in which we know Jesus is the speaker gives us an affecting view of his feelings under the vile reproaches he met with from men Thus he laments  unto his Father  "They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head they that would destroy me being mine enemies wrongfully are mighty then I restored that which I took not awayLet not them that wait on thee O Lord God of hosts be ashamed for my sake let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake O God of Israel because for thy sake I have born reproach shame hath covered my face I am become a stranger unto my brethren and an alien unto my mother's children for the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me When I wept and chastened my soul with fasting that was to my reproach I made sackcloth my garment and I became a proverb unto them They  that sit in the gate speak against me and I was the song of the drunkard"  The remainder of this Psalm chiefly relates to what took place on the cross but this much evidently belongs to what Christ suffered during his public ministry Compare the th verse with John And the th verse with John  Having gone through the various scenes of private and public life having thus far continued in all things that are written in the book of the law and having already experienced much of that affliction to which sinful man is obnoxious he now enters upon the last awful scene in which he is to finish his work and thus fully discharge that debt which as our Surety he had taken upon himself  The hour being come he withdrew to eat his last passover supper with his  disciples After supper they left the City repaired to the mount of Olives  Mat  and from thence into the garden of Gethsemane  Mat  John  Judas was now gone to the chief priests  John  from whom he was shortly to come with an armed band Jesus therefore left part of his disciples  Mat  at the garden door to wait their arrival and took Peter James and John  Mat  to be witnesses of his Passion as they had been of his Transfiguration  Mat  "And he began to be sore amazed and to be very heavy and saith unto them My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry ye hear and watch And he went forward a little  Mark  and kneeled down and prayed saying Father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine  be done  We are not warranted to conclude that these were all or near all the words which Jesus now expressed They may contain the  substance  of all he prayed for at this time or at least of all which the disciples heard  distinctly  but from the circumstances of his  retiring  to pray and the disciples  falling asleep  while he was praying and his saying to Peter when he returned from prayer the first time  "Couldst thou not watch  one hour  "  from these circumstances I say It is evident that Jesus continued a considerable time at prayer  Luke  Having thus prayed he returned to the three disciples and finding them asleep He said unto Peter Simon sleepest thou couldst thou not watch one hour Watch ye and pray lest ye enter into temptation the spirit truly is willing but the flesh is weak  Mat  The sorrows of his soul still continuing he went and prayed again to the same purpose saying O my Father if this cup may not pass from me except I drink it thy will be done  Mat  Although the  three disciples had been admonished in such tender accents by their suffering Friend yet their eyes closed again before he had concluded his second prayer so that he found them asleep at his next return  By returning thus frequently to his disciples he gave them opportunity to read his diftress in his countenance and gestures  Once more he leaves them and there appeared an Angel unto him from heaven strengthening him And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling to the ground Thus our adorable Immanuel suffered unspeakable sorrows in his soul as long as divine justice at this time demanded And when he arose up from prayer and was come to his disciples he found them sleeping  for sorrow  Luke  This circumstance shews that they  were not quite inattentive to what was passing before them The grief they felt at the sight of his distress so overpowered them that they sank into sleep  Judas having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and pharisees now came with lanterns and torches and weapons and Jesus knowing all things that should come upon him went forth to meet them and said unto them Whom seek ye They said Jesus of Nazareth Jesus said unto them I AM HE Immanuel thought proper to make the guard sensible upon this occasion that they could not take him without his consent and accordingly these words were spoken in such a manner that the whole band went backward and fell to the ground The end being answered he permitted them to  recover Then asked he them again Whom seek ye They said Jesus of Nazareth Jesus answered I have told you that I am he if therefore ye seek me let these pointing to his disciples go their way  John  The soldiers or rather some of the servants of the high priest laid hands on Jesus  Mat  and Peter drew a sword smote one of them and cut off his ear Then said Jesus unto Peter Put up thy sword the cup which my Father hath given me shall I not drink it  John  And Jesus said suffer ye thus far and he touched his ear and healed him  Luke  All his disciples forsook him and fled  Mat  Then the band and the captain and the officers of the Jews took Jesus and bound him  John  and led him away to the high priest and with him were assembled all the chief priests  and the elders and the scribes  Mark  The high prist then asked Jesus of his disciples and of his doctrine Jesus answered him I spake openly to the world I ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple whither the Jews always resort and in secret have I said nothing Why askest thou me Ask them which heard me what I have said unto them behold they know what I said When he had thus spoken one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand saying Answerest thou the high priest so Jesus answered him If I have spoken evil bear witness of the evil but if well why smitest thou me  John  Now the chief priests and elders and all the council sought false witness against Jesus to put him to death  but found none for though many bare false witness against him their witness did not agree together  Mark  At last came two false witnesses and said This fellow said I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days The high priest arose and said unto him Answerest thou nothing What is it which these witness against thee But Jesus held his peace  Mat  Some of the council said unto him Art thou the Christ tell us And he said unto them If I tell you ye will not believe and if I also ask you ye will not answer me nor let me go  Luke  The high priest said unto him I adjure thee by the living God that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ the Son of God  Mat  Jesus saidI AM  Mark  Nevertheless or as some translate it  moreover  I say unto you hereafter  ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven  Mat  Upon this the whole council exclaimed Art thou then the SON OF GOD He answered Ye say that or  that which  I am  Luke  Then the high priest rent his clothes and said What need we any further witness  Mark  for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth  Luke  And they all condemned him to be guilty of death  Mark  Then did they spit in his face  Mat  they blindsolded him they buffetted him  Mark  and said Prophesy unto us thou Christ who it is that smote thee  Mat  And the servants struck him with the palms of their hands  Mark  The priests and elders having thus condemned Jesus they consulted together again  Mark  and resolved to carry  him before Pilate the Roman Governor that he likewise might pass sentence upon him Without this they could not accomplish their purpose because the power of life and death was now taken out of their hands  John  Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of Judgment Pilate went out unto them and said What accusation bring ye against this man They answered If he were not a malefactor we would not have delivered him unto thee Pilate said Take ye him and judge him according to your law They replied It is not lawful for us to put any man to death  John  Pilate being obliged to proceed to the tryal the Jews began to accuse him saying We found this fellow perverting the nation and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar saying that  he himself is Christ a King  Luke  Then Pilate entered into the judgmenthall again and called Jesus and said unto him Art thou the King of the Jews Jesus answered Sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it thee of me  When the Jews asked Jesus if he was the Son of God he answered directly  I am  but when Pilate asked him if he was a King he first sets him right about the import of the question and then he answers itThe question which the jews asked needed no explanationit was plain they intended to ask if he were the Son of God in such a sense as would be blasphemy in any meer creature to this he could directly reply I am But as Pilate intended or might be understood to ask if he were a  temporal  Monarch therefore Jesus entered into this explanation  Pilate replied Am I a jew thine own nation and the chief priests have dilivered thee unto me what hast thou done Jesus answered My kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom was of this world then would my servants fight that I should  not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence Pilate therefore said unto him Art thou a king then Jesus answered Thou sayest that I am or  that which I am  A King To this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth every one that is of the truth heareth my voice  Pilate having found that Jesus disallowed  fighting  and only proposed to erect a kingdom by bearing witness to truth he plainly saw that his kingdom could never interfere with the authority of CaesarWhat is truth said he and immediately went out to the jews and said I find in him no fault at all  John  This exasperated the jews much and they were the more fierce saying He stirreth up the people teaching  throughout all Jewry beginning from Galilee to this place  Luke  Mark informs us that they accused him of  many  things but he answered nothing Pilate asked him again Answerest thou nothing behold how many things they witness against thee But Jesus yet answered nothing so that Pilate marvelled  Mark  It is easy to see in Pilate the great man in embarrassment He evidently dreaded condemning Jesus for fear of what might happen in the next world but then he had measures to keep with the Jews and with his master Caesar and this at length had the ascendency At present perhaps he hoped to extricate himself from this dilemma by the next step he tookWhen Pilate heard of  Galilee  he asked whether the man were a Galilea  And as soon as he heard that he belonged to HEROD'S Jurisdiction he sent him to Herod who happened so to speak to be at Jerusalem at that time  When Herod saw Jesus he was exceeding glad for he was desirous to see him of a long season because he had heard many things of him and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him Then he questioned with him in many words but he answered him nothing  Luke  The expectation of this great man being raised so high his disappointment must have been very mortisyingThe chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused JesusWe are not informed particularly of what they now accused him but we may learn from the effect that they ran upon  his having assumed the titles and honours of the Messiah for the insults he met with were plainly in derision of thatAnd Herod with his men of war set him at nought and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him again to Pilate  Luke  Pilate called the chief priests and the rulers together and in the hearing of the multitude he addressed them thusYe have brought this man unto me as one that perverteth the people and behold I having examined him before you have found no fault in him touching the things whereof ye accuse him No nor yet Herod for I sent you to him I will therefore chastise him and release him For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast But the chief priest and elders persuaded  the multitude that they should ask Barabbas and destroy Jesus And they cried all at once Away with this man and release unto us Barabbas Pilate willing to release Jesus speak again unto them but they cried Crucify him Crucify him And he said unto them the third time Why what evil hath he done I find no cause of death in him I will therefore chastise him and let him go And they were instant with loud voices requiring that he should be crucified and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed  Luke  When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but that rather a tumult was made he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying I am innocent of the blood of this just person see ye to it Then answered  all the people and said His blood be upon us and on our children Then released he Barabbas unto them and when he had scourged Jesus he delivered him to be crucified  Mat  yet not without making other attempts to save him  The soldiers having received orders to crucify Jesus took him first and scourged him Then they put on him a scarlet or purple robe  It is said that the Ancients gave the name of purple to all colours that had any mixture of red in them consequently scarlet itself obtained that name  Mat  Mark  John  and when they had platted a crown of thorns they put it on his head and a reed in his hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying Hail king of the Jews And they spit upon him and took the reed and smote him upon the head  Mat  Pilate now goes forth again to the Jews and thus accosts themBehold I bring him forth unto you that ye may know I find no fault in him Then came Jesus forth wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe and Pilate saith unto them Behold the man When the chief priests and officers saw him they cried out Crucify him Crucify him Pilate saith unto them Take ye him and crucify him for I find no fault in him The Jews answered We have a law and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the Son of God  John  When Pilate heard that Jesus called himself the Son of God he was the more afraid and went again into the judgmenthall and saith unto Jesus Whence art thou But Jesus gave him no answer Then Pilate  said unto him Speakest thou not unto me Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee and have power to release thee Jesus answered Thou couldest have no power at all against me except it were given thee from above  Once more Pilate sought to release him but the Jews cried out If thou let this man go  thou art not Caesars friend  whosoever maketh himself a King speaketh against Caesar When Pilate heard  that saying  he brought Jesus forth and sat down in the judgmentseat And he said unto the Jews Behold your king But they cried out Away with him away with him crucify him Pilate said Shall I crucify your King The chief priests answered We have no king but Caesar  John  Then delivered he Jesus unto them to be crucified And they took the purple robe off him and put his own cloathes on him and led him away to crucify him  Mat  By comparing the Evangelists together it appears that when they first set out Jesus himself carried the Cross upon which he was to be crucified But as they led him away they laid hold upon one Simon a Cyrenian coming out of the country and on him they laid the Cross that he might bear it after Jesus  John  Luke  The cruel disposition which the Jews and Roman soldiers manifested forbids us to look upon this as an act of compassion toward Jesus it seems more probable that Jesus had sunk under its weight Nor should we think this at all inconsistent with his divinity for although as God he supported the universe by the word of his power  Heb  yet as man he was subject to the feelings of humanity  John  and if we consider the fatigue of the preceding night spent without sleepthe sufferings he had undergone in the gardenhis having been hurried from place to place during his tryal the want of food and loss of blood he had sustainedif we consider these things we may see reason to believe that he was not long able as man to carry the Cross  As they led him to Calvary there followed him a great company of people and of women who bewailed and lamented him but he said unto them Daughters of Jerusalem weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children for behold the days are coming in the which ye shall say Blessed are the barren and  the wombs that never bare and the paps that never gave suck Then shall they begin to say to the mountains Fall on us and to the hills Cover us For if they do these things in a green tree what shall be done in the dry  A  green  tree is an emblem of a righteous person and a  dry  tree of the wicked Ezek Chap The meaning therefore is If I who am Righteous suffer these things for the sins of my people what shall be done to the man who must bear his own sins  When they were come to a place called Golgotha they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall and when he had tasted thereof he would not drink And when they were come to Calvary they Crucified himThe appointed soldiers dig the ground wherein the Cross is to be erected The nails and the hammer are ready The Cross is laid on the ground Jesus is stripped and lies down on the bed of sorrows They nail him to it  They erect it He hangs upon his wounds bleeding between two thieves  John  praying for his enemies  Luke  reviled by the mob  Mat  the rulers  Luke  the priests  Mark  the soldiers  Luke  the two thieves  Mat  Mark  andGod his Father forsook him  Mat  It appears that Jesus continued in this situation for about six hours before he expired  Mark  during which time he did not utter many words so as to be heard by those who stood by but David informs us in what manner his mind was exercised  "My prayer is unto thee O Lord in an acceptable time O God in the multitude of thy mercy hear me in the truth of thy salvation Deliver me out of the mire and let me not sink let me be delivered from them that hate me and out of the deep  waters Let not the waterflood overflow me neither let the deep swallow me up and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me Hear me O Lord for thy lovingkindness is good turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies and hide not thy face from thy servant for I am in trouble hear me speedily Draw nigh unto my soul and redeem it deliver me because of mine enemies Thou hast known my reproach and my shame and my dishonour mine adversaries are all before thee Reproach hath broken my heart and I am full heaviness and I looked for some to take pity but there was none and for comforters but I found none They gave me gall for my meat and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink  Psal  MY GOD MY GOD WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME why  art thou so far from helping me and from the voice of my roaringBut thou art holy O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel Our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou didst deliver them They cried unto thee and were delivered they trusted in thee and were not confounded But I am a worm and no man a reproach of men and despised of the people All they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying He trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him But thou art he that took me out of the womb thou didst make me to hope when I was upon my mother's breast I was cast upon thee from the womb thou art my God from my mother's belly Be not far from me for trouble is near for there is none  to help Many bulls have compassed me strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round They gaped upon me with their mouths as a ravening and roaring lion I am poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint my heart is like wax it is melted in the midst of my bowels My strength is dried up like a potsherd and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws and  Thou  hast brought me into the dust of death For dogs have compassed me the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me they pierced my hands and my feet I may tell all my bones they look and stare upon me They part my garments among them and cast lots upon my vesture But be not  Thou  far from me O Lord O my Strength haste thee to help me  Psal  c'Tis doneThe voice of our Mediator prevails  our Surety has paid the debtthe law can demand no morejustice is satisfiedJesus looking to his reconciled Father said Into thy hands I commend my spirit  Luke  Thou hast sent me to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness  Dan  and now  IT IS FINISHED  John  And behold the veil of the Temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of their graves  after his resurrection  and went into the holy City and appeared unto many  Mat  The Jews because it was the preparation that the bodies should not remain upon the Cross on the Sabbath  day besought Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away Then came the soldiers and brake the legs of the first and of the other that was crucified with him but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was dead already they brake not his legs but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forth with came there out blood and water  The spear thrust into his side is thought to have reached his heart for the water issuing from the wound seems to shew that the pericardium was pierced and that Jesus had been some time dead Or if he had not this wound was of such a nature as must have killed him And therefore as it was of great importance to mankind to be ascertained of the truth of Christ's death when John relates this circumstance he insists upon it particularly and mentions it as a thing which he himself saw  "And he that saw it bear record and his record is true and he knoweth that he saith true that ye may believe"  John  When the Even was come Joseph of Arimathea a rich man and an honourable counsellor went to Pilate  and craved the body of Jesus  Marst  Nicodemus also came and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundred pound weight Then took they the body of Jesus and wound it in linnen cloths with the spices as the manner of the Jews is to bury In the place where he was crucified there was a garden and in the garden a new sepulchre there laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews preparationday for the sepulchre was nigh at hand  John  This tomb belonged to Joseph of Arimathea it was his own new tomb which he had hewn out of the rock And he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre and departed  Mat  SECTION IV As the payment of the uttermost farthing completes the satisfaction which is immediately followed by giving a discharge therefore as our Surety has now fully paid our debts it is expected that he should be discharged from the prison of the grave and also take possession of the reward of Righteousness  NOW the important question is brought to a crisis and the Judge of all is called upon by both parties to  interpose and give decisionJesus had called God his Father in a sense which implied equality of nature  John Chap  and accordingly he called upon all men to honour the Son even as they honoured the Father  John  The Jews upon the other hand called this BlasphemyAgain Jesus maintained that all men himself only excepted were sinners and that they could obtain the divine favour only through him  John Chap and and  But the Jews could by no means admit the truth of this they being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness could not submit to be saved by the righteousness of our incarnate God  Rom  They had no objection to a Messiah who should tell them what good thing  they  should do to obtain eternal lise but they were offended at the thought of his being the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth  These were the chief points in debate between Jesus and the Jewish nation and when Jesus was dead and buried they hoped that this controversy was decided in their favour They argued in a triumphant and insulting manner even while Jesus was nailed to the CrossHe saved others let him  save himself  said they if he be the Christ the chosen of God Let Christ the King of Israel descend from the Cross that we may see and believe He trusted in God let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said  I am the Son of God  Luke  Mark  Mat  This triumph was premature The decision of the question did not turn  upon his coming down from the Cross but upon his rising again from the dead This was to be the grand proof on either side If Christ did not rife from the dead the Jews were right in rejecting him as the promised Messiah but if he did then all he taught is TRUE and the Jews were guilty of a murder the most atrocious that could be committed  This medium of proof had been previously fixed upon The Jews more than once demanded a sign of his being the Messiah and Jesus referred them to his resurrection  Mat  John  They did not forget this as we shall see  Jesus was crucified and buried on the Jew's preparationday that is the day before the sabbath  John  The sabbath day commenced at sunset  Lev  and it was as much as they could do to  to get the Bodies from the Cross before its commencement  John  On the day after the day of preparation that is on the sabbath day which as was observed began when the sun was setting the chief priests and pharisees came together to Pilate saying Sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive After three days I will rise again Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people He is risen from the dead so the last error shall be worse than the first Pilate said unto them Ye have a watch go your way make it as sure as you can So they went and made the sepulchre sure sealing the stone  See  Dan  where a similar precaution is used by Darius in the case of Daniel  and setting a watch  Mat  Thus while  the chief priests and pharisees very prudently guarded against fraud resolving no doubt to exhibit the body of Jesus after the third day as an impostor they put the truth of his resurrection beyond all reasonable doubt by furnishing a number of unexceptionable witnesses to it even the Roman Soldiers whose testimony they themselves could not refuse For behold At the appointed hour the Angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door of the sepulchre His countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men  Mat  Jesus without an Angel could easily have opened himself a passage from the tomb but it was meet that  Angels should attend and open the door to their rising Lord It was meet that his  servant  should dismiss a band of ruffians and send them terrified to tell their employers the awful tale There was also a propriety in the Angel's opening a free passage into the sepulchre for the friends of Jesus and in waiting there until their arrival  Very early in the morning upon the first day of the week the women came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the Sun  Mark  bringing the spices which they had prepared  Luke  It appears that they were dissatisfied with the hasty manner in which upon account of the approaching sabbath the body of their Lord had been embalmed so they came when the sabbath was past to do it properly  And as they went along they said among themselves Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre  for it was great  They seem unacquainted with all that had passed since the evening of the day on which their Lord was crucified when the disciples rolled the stone to the door of the sepulchre and departed  And when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away  Mark  And they entered in but found not the body of the Lord Jesus  Luke  Upon this one of them Mary Magdalene ran to seek the Apostles to tell them the  distressing  news Finding Peter and John she saith unto them They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre and we know not where they have laid him Then these two Apostles ran to go to the sepulchre  Johe  While Mary Magdalene was gone in quest of the Apostles it appears that the other women having probably searched round the garden in  vain entered the sepulchre a second time and saw the Angel that rolled away the stone sitting within and they were affrighted  Mark  But the Angel said unto them Fear not ye for I know that ye seek Jesus which was crucified He is not here for he is risen as he said Come see the place where the Lord lay  Mat  And as they were much perplexed thereabout two Angels stood by them in shining garments and as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth the Angels said unto them Why seek ye the living among the dead He is not here but is risen remember how he spake unto you while he was yet with you in Galilee saying The son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day  rise again  Luke  But go your way tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into Galilee there shall ye see him as he said unto you  Mark  And they remembered his words  Luke  And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with sear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples word  Mat  After the women had departed Peter and John came to the sepulchre to examine the truth of what Mary Magdalene had told them concerning the body of Jesus being taken away and Mary herself followed them Peter and John having entered the sepulchre and not finding the body of their Lord they seem to have believed as Mary did that some one had taken it away as yet they knew nothing of his resurrection Then  they went again unto their own homeBut Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre and seeth two Angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain And they say unto her Woman why weepest thou she saith unto them Because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him And when she had thus said she turned herself back probably being affrighted and saw Jesus standing and knew not that it was Jesus Jesus saith unto her Woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou She supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him Sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and I will take him away Jesus  saith unto her  Mary  She turned herself and saith unto him MASTERCalling her by her name with his usual tone of voice she knew him and would have embraced him but he declined this for the present giving her to understand that as he was not yet ascended she would have other opportunities for expressing her joy but that she must go immediately and tell his  Brethren  c  John  While these things were passing the company of women who saw the Angels at the sepulchre and who were despatched by them to tell the disciples what they saw and heard found  some  of the disciples and delivered their message to them amongst whom were Cleopas and his companion  Luke  These women going in quest of some other of the disciples Jesus  met them saying All hail And they came and fell at his feet and worshipped him Jesus saith unto them Be not afraid go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee and there shall they see me  Mat    Now  these women had something more to tell Before they could only say We have seen a vision of Angels who said he is alive but now they could say We have seen him  While the women were going to spread these glad tidings some of the watch came into the City and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done And when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel they gave a great bribe unto the soldiers saying Say ye His disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept  Mat  The  priests could hardly be so stupid as not to know what judgment the world would form of guards telling what happened  while they were asleep  but absurd as this might be it was the best colour which could be put upon the matter  The women having found their brethren told all things which they had heard and seen And they when they had heard that Jesus was alive and had been seen and had spoken these things believed not  Mark  Peter however who had been mentioned  by name  as one unto whom the news should be told  Mark  arose and ran a second time unto the sspulchre and stooping down he beheld nothing but the linen clothes and departed wondering in himself at that which was come to pass  Luke  The Lord's appearance to Peter mentioned Cor may have  happened as he was returning from the sepulchre this second time for we are certain it took place on the day of the resurrection  After this Jesus appeared to two of his disciples who were going to Emmaus and a long and interesting conversation took place Its length obliges me to omit it here but the reader may see it in Luke These two disciples returned the same evening to Jerusalem where they found the Eleven that is the Apostles and others with them Before they came Peter had arrived with a confirmation of the report first given by the women and therefore the Apostles accost these two disciples thus THE LORD IS RISEN INDEED  and hath appeared unto Simon  Then Cleopas and his companion relate what they knew and as they spake Jesus himself stood  in the midst of them and gave them every demonstration that men are capable of receiving  Luke  John  But Thomas one of the twelve was not with them when Jesus came The other disciples therefore said unto him We have seen the Lord But he said unto them Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side I will not believe  And after eight days again his disciples were within and Thomas with them Then came Jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said Peace be unto you Then turning to Thomas Reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my sideThe sight of  Jesus must have been sufficient to prove his refurrection but the knowledge which he now shewed of what was doing when he was absent in body brought his divinity so strongly to mind that Thomas answered by saying unto Jesus My Lord and my God  John  Jesus having first by Angels  Mat  and afterwards in person  Mat  ordered his disciples to go home to Galilee with a promise that they should see him there they went And when they were come to their respective homes they followed their occupations as usual and particularly the Apostles who pursued their old trade of fishing upon the Lake There were together Peter Thomas Nathanael James John and two other disciples Peter saith unto them I go a fishing They  say unto him We also go with you They went and spent the whole night without catching any thing When the morning was now come Jesus stood on the shore but they did not know him owing probably to its being as yet somewhat dark and they being some distance from the shore Jesus saith unto them Children have ye any meat They answered No He said unto them Cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find They did so and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes Therefore John saith unto Peter It is the Lord Then they all made haste to shore found it even so and dined together in his company  John  John observes that this was the  third  time that Jesus appeared to his disciples  John  He means the third  time he appeared to the Apostles in a body or company for this was the  seventh  time he appeared viz to Mary Magdalene to the other women to Peter who was the first  man  who saw him to the two disciples going to Emmaus to the Apostles Thomas being absent to the Apostles again at Jerusalem Thomas being present and now for the first time in Galilee  After this he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part were still living when Paul wrote his first Epistle to the Corinthians  Cor  This seems to be that appearance of himself upon a mountain in Galilee which he had repeatedly promised to his brethren and unto which we read of the Apostles going Mat  It appears that the disciples returned  after this to Jerusalem  From  Acts  compared with  Luke  it is plain that the discourses before his ascension related  Mark  and  Luke  were delivered in or near Jerusalem Besides he ascended from the mount of Olives  Acts  Here again he appeared unto them and how often he did so we cannot tell  It is evident that he shewed himself to the apostle James alone though none of the evangelists relate that appearance  Cor  But we are told that he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible Proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God and being assembled with them commanded that they should not depart from Jerusalem until they were fully qualified by the holy spirit to preach the Gospel in all languages and nations  And he led them out to the mount of Olives as far as to Bethany  About two miles from Jerusalem  John  and  he lift up his hands and blessed them  Luke  Acts  And while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven  Luke  Acts  a cloud received him out of their sight  Luke  Acts  "God is gone up with a shout the Lord with the sound of a trumpet Sing praises to God sing praises sing praises to our King sing praises  Psalm  Lift up your heads O ye gates and be ye lift up ye everlasting doors and the King of glory shall come in Who is the King of glory The Lord of Hosts he is the King of glory  Psalm  The chariots of God are twenty thousand even thousands of Angels the Lord is among them as in Sinai in the holy place Thou hast ascended on high thou hast led captivity captive thou hast received gifts for men yea for the rebellious  also that the Lord God might dwell among them  Psal  Eph  "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world  Eph  We were by nature the children of wrath even as others but God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he hath loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus  Eph  Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into the holy of holies whither the FORERUNNER is  for us  entered even Jesus made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec being by interpretation first KING OF RIGHTEOUSNESS and after that KING OF PEACE  Heb Chap  Sing O ye Heavens for the Lord hath done it Shout ye lower parts of the earth Break forth into singing ye mountains O Forest and every tree therein For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob and glorified him self in Israel  Isa  TO THE READER  BELIEVE IN THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND THOU SHALT BE SAVED  Acts  PART II OBJECTIONS ANSWERED  OBJECTION I  THE famous Author of the Age of Reason says  "  The doctrine of Redemption has for its basis an idea of pecuniary justice and not that of moral justice If I owe a person money and am not able to pay him and he threatens to put me in prison another person may take the debt upon himself and pay it for me but if I have committed a crime every circumstance of the case is changed moral justice cannot take the innocent for the guilty even if the innocent would offer itself  "  To this we reply  This distinction between  moral  Justice and  pecuniary  Justice has no  foundation in the nature of things Justice is  moral  Justice still whether it has to do with money or with murder When the moral law says Owe no man any thing it delivers a  moral  precept and speaks the language of  moral  Justice no less than when it says Thou shalt not kill What is it no  crime  to contract debts when we are not able to pay Surely it is Yet if my friend is willing to become Surety for me however innocent he may be moral Justice requires that he should smart for it  When a Surety is admitted in any case his admission is founded not upon Justice  only  but also upon mercy If I owe money and am not able to pay it and if Justice admits of another person taking the debt upon himself and discharging it for me this is uniting Justice and mercy together  When my friend sees me in distress takes my place and discharges my debts this is an act of  mercy  Justice admits but mercy performs it Again When my creditor demands payment of my Surety his doing so is an act of Justice So that in this case Justice  demands  and mercy  grants  payment  From hence we may discover the principle upon which the office of a Surety is founded It is ordained chiefly for the sake of harmonizing Justice and mercy These two attributes in many cases seem to clash Justice might require the law to be put in force against an unfortunate or dishonest debtor while mercy might prompt a Judge to spare him either for his own or for his miserable family's sake What is to be done in this case If Justice is heard mercy cries  in vain if mercy prevails Justice retires dissatisfied but by the interposition of a Surety mercy and Justice kiss and embrace each other Does this render either attribute less amiable Far from it It heightens their native charmsIf Justice had refused the proposal of a Suretya Surety every way able to answer its demands would it not seem too implacable And upon the other hand if mercy had insisted upon the debt being cancelled without payment when the Surety could well afford it would it not appear an enemy to Justice and might not the creditor justly complain  Having discovered the principle upon which the office of a Surety proceeds to determine in any particular case whether a Surety may or may not be admitted we must consider whether the circumstances of the case  be such that all things considered the admission of a Surety can subserve the mutual purposes of Justice and mercy  We can now explain how it comes to pass that human laws can so seldom admit of a Surety in criminal cases I say  seldom  because even human laws sometimes go this far as for instance when a  crime  is punished by a fine which is often the case a man's friend may pay it for him Again sometimes when a crime is committed the criminal is set at liberty by finding sureties for his future good behaviour and if he afterwards is guilty of the same crime his sureties are liable to suffer in his stead And again  National Hostages  are a very ancient and general expedient In this case it is universally allowed that when any person delivers himself up  as the hostage or surety of his nation he is liable to suffer for the crimes of his country But as has been observed it is not always that human laws can admit of a surety in criminal cases This is not because our legislators condemn the principle itself for if they did how could they adopt it in the instances just alluded to but the reason is They find in certain cases the circumstances are such that a Surety cannot be made to subserve the mutual purposes of justice and mercy or answer any good end but would rather be attended with many evil consequences For instance When murder is committed justice demands life for life and here it is impossible amongst men to make use of a surety Because Who would willingly die for a murderer If such a person could be found who gave him power  over his life to dispose of it in such a way There would be no security for the future conduct of the criminal and therefore it would only be depriving society of a useful member to give back one who might immediately commence his former destructive practices It could not even serve the purpose of mercy because all that mercy might gain by the salvation of the criminal it would lose again in the death of his surety  For these causes we grant to the objector that in many cases of a criminal nature  "All the circumstances are so changed that moral justice cannot take the innocent for the guilty"  that is justice cannot under these circumstances admit of a surety But then when these circumstances come to be named not one of them can be objected to the Suretiship of Christ  For instance He had absolute power over his own life and a sovereign right to dispose of it as he saw good Moreover having humbled himself to the state of a servant he acted not only by his own choice but in obedience to the commandment of his Father No individual beside himself sustained the least inconvenience from his undertaking He did not redeem his people that they might continue their pernicious practices but made it absolutely certain that they should leave them off and begin a life of righteousness the moment they should be made acquainted with what he had done for them Their language upon this occasion is Lord the half of my goods I give to the poor and if I have taken any thing from any man I restore him foursold In substituting Jesus in the room  of the guilty all the ends of mercy as well as divine justice were fully answered Myriads of men were thus raised from the greatest depth of guilt and misery to an eternity of holiness and happiness And although this cost our divine Surety much yet in the end he obtained what he deemed an ample recompense He had power not only to lay down his life but also to take it again he saw of the travel of his soul and was satisfied he saw the eternal happiness of his people secured and this gave him infinite delight he saw every perfection of the Godhead glorified in the highest and the foundation laid for eternal hallelujah's from all the blessed and he saw himself in his human nature crowned with that glory which in his divine nature he had with his Father before the world was These  considerations go to prove that it was perfectly consistent with justice as well as glorious to divine mercy to substitute Jesus in the room of his guilty people To this we must add  It would not be consistent with justice to admit a  sinner  to glory without this substitution Mercy might provide such a surety as justice could admit but mercy could not consistently with justice bestow happiness on the guilty without a Surety No reason can be given why justice should refuse this Surety but many reasons may be given why it should demand him For instance If the sinner had been saved without this Surety the divine law would be made void The part of a subject is to obey the part of a Sovereign is to keep up the authority of his laws Though subjects neglect their part the Sovereign may  do his Though the law be broken yet while that treatment is given to disobedience and obedience which the Lawgiver has appointed the authority of the law is still kept up but if the Sovereign neglect his part dispense with the execution of the law then the law passes away and in effect the Governor resigns his authority and tolerates all manner of wickedness and confusion It is shocking to that reason which God has given us to see a magistrate without power over his subjects to see a parent without authority among his children or a master among his servants but this is nothing in comparison with beholding GOD destitute of authority among his creatures In other cases this want of authority would produce confusion only in kingdoms or families but in this case it would bring the  whole universe into disorder The former would infer confusion only for a  time  but this introduces confusion to  eternity  I shall conclude this article with two very opposite specimens of reasoning and leave the Reader to his choice  Mr Thomas Paine after telling his readers that  "No  external  evidence can at this long distance of time be produced to prove whether the church fabricated the doctrine of redemption or not" adds "therefore the question can only be referred to the  internal  evidence which the thing carries in itself and this" continues he "affords a very strong presumption of its being a fabrication for the internal evidence is that the doctrine of redemption has for its basis an idea of pecuniary justice and not that of moral justice"  Jonathan says  "As the character of THE JUST GOD AND THE SAVIOUR can no where be published but along with the doctrine of redemption I am assured by seeing the GRANDEST CHARACTER thence arising that the doctrine must be true For to suppose that the bare notion or idea of any thing greater than God could ever be any where imagined would be the wildest of all absurdities Moreover it must be very evident that that view of God which the lower it abases the pride of man raises his comfort and joy the higherwhich reduces man to the most unreserved dependence while it exalts him to the summit of all happiness could never be the contrivance of man whose strongest impulse is towards the gratifying of his pride and whose joy naturally rises or sinks according to the success  thereof Therefore when the doctrine of redemption and the character of God thence resulting are conveyed to my mind by the same testimony I have no room to doubt that God who alone can describe his own character is the testifier of both"  "This doctrine" continues Jonathan "while it proves all my former wisdom to be foolishness opens to me a new and more delightful source of knowledge throwing light upon a thousand facts that I could never account for before shewing me a no less satisfactory than wonderful propriety in all the extraordinary circumstances attending the Birth Life Death and Resurrection of Jesus and the ministry of his witnessesIt throws light upon all the ancient sacred writings and the extraordinary facts recorded in them from the creation downwards  It sets my mind at rest as to all the difficulties about the divine character and the condition of man which occasionally pinched me beforeI am now reconciled to the entrance of sin and death into the world and the whole dark side of things on account of the light that shines from the greatest darknessI am now reconciled to the shade on account of the magnificent picture thence arising to my view In a word I thence perceive a no less amiable than grand uniformity of design in all the works of God from first to last Whereas should I shut my eyes against the light issuing from thence I am immediately lost in an unfathomable abyss ofguilt despair and death"  "I am fully satisfied then in agreement with the Apostles to hold this doctrine as the Gospel the Word  and Testimony of God and to call it by way of eminence THE TRUTH in opposition to every false gloss upon the scriptures and every false reasoning about the light or law of nature or about any of the works or ways of GodLet this Truth be my companion and I will not be ashamed in the presence of all the sons of Socrates though joined with those of Gamaliel"  Thus far Jonathan  The objection we have now considered is supposed to come not only from Deists but also from all those nominal christians who reject  altogether  the Suretiship of Christ As Deists deny the authority of the Bible and as the others pay but little homage to it's divinity I have hitherto avoided the impertinence of quoting that Book  in a way of proof When arguing with such persons it is necessary to meet them upon their own groundthe light of nature  The objections which follow come from a different peoplepeople who admit  in part  the Suretiship of Christ and who profess a greater reverence for the Word of God The question therefore and the medium of proof are both changed In the former case the question was Can divine Justice admit of a Surety to act and suffer for sinful men In the present case this is granted and the question is What was the sinner's Surety bound to perform The former question was argued upon the ground of common sense but this is to be determined by the word of God Not that we are now to lay aside the use of our reason only whereas we formerly reasoned from  principles of natural light we must now reason from Revelation  OBJECTION II  "  WE grant that Christ  died  as our Substitute but his conformity to the moral law is set before us as an  example  which shews that he did not obey this law for us in his life in the same precise sense in which he obeyed it for us in his death otherwise we should have been as fully freed from obedience to it in every respect as we are from it's penalty or curse  "  Answer  His sufferings also are laid before us as an example  John  Peter  John  and if his sufferings may be both substitutional and exemplary why may not his obedience to the law be so also If it be said His sufferings are not exemplary in the same respect wherein they are substitutional I answer Neither is his  obedience Obedience to the law considered as the  condition  of happiness is no more binding upon his disciples  Rom  than sufferings are considered as  expiatory  And this indeed proves that he did obey the law for us in the same respect in which he suffered for us that is  As our Surety  for if he had not we should have been bound to obey it ourselves and that upon condition of obtaining happiness for obedience to this law is the unalterable condition upon which we may obtain eternal life But I need not say much in reply to this objection A babe in Christ will see that it betrays great ignorance of the nature of Christianity When we are told that If Christ obeyed the law for us we cannot be bound to observe it even as a rule of conduct it is just like saying  Since Christ has obeyed the law as well as suffered its penalty in order to give us a title to happiness therefore we are under no obligation to glorify God for his mercy  OBJECTION III  "  THE holiness of Christ's heart and life in conformity to the moral law was a necessary qualification of his own personit qualified him for the work he came to finish as our substitute but it was not the very work itself  "  Answer  If Christ had not been made under the law to fulfil it as our substitute his conformity to it could not have been a necessary qualification of his own person Immanuel would have been perfectly holy in heart and life if he had never been bound to obey those precepts which are proper and peculiar to  meer creatures  to  mensinful  men Therefore when the incarnate God was made under the law it was  to redeem  not to  qualify  himself for redeeming Thus the objection seems  to form a flat contradiction to the word of God To set this in a clearer light let us consider The law to which Immanuel conformed His conformity to this law The dignity of the person who thus conformed to this law  The law to which our divine Surety conformed is the very same law which his people were under  "He was made under the law to redeem them that were under the law"  The moral law may indeed be considered as the one law unto all God's reasonable creatures in respect of the principle from which obedience should proceed namely  Love  But still this law has different forms according to the different natures and also according to the different circumstances of those to whom it is given so that in some respects the law given to Angels  and the law given to men will be different It will not be said unto Angels  "Honour thy father and thy mother"  Nor yet  "Thou shalt not commit adultery"  Such precepts as these are not adapted to their natureAgain The moral law will differ also according to the different circumstances of creatures of the same species I shall mention two remarkable instances of this which cast considerable light upon the question before usThe first is that remarkable difference in the moral duties of men which is caused by the entrance of Sin The precept  "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self"  although it be the same precept both before and after the fall yet it  now  binds us to do many things which would not have been our duty if we had never sinned For instance If we had not sinned this  precept would only bind us to love the Righteous for we and all our neighbours would have been of that description but since we have sinned this same precept binds us to love the unrighteous for we and all our neighbours are at least by nature of this characterAnother important difference in the moral law which depends upon the circumstances of those to whom it is given is the difference between this law considered only as a rule of life and considered as prescribing the condition of acquiring happiness This is not a fanciful but a real and important difference and the persons to whom I now speak will admit it They know that all men are by nature under this law as prescribing the terms and condition of acquiring happiness but the believer in Jesus has a title to glory independent  of his own obedience and he conforms to the law only as a rule of conduct  We are to consider Christ's conformity to this law And here we must observe Christ was made under the law not before but after the entrance of sinnot when it bound man to love none but the righteous but when it bound us to love sinners Christ's conformity to the law was constant and universal that is he  continued  in  all  things that are written in the book of the law to do them His conformity to this law was properly  obedience  that is submission to its authority This is plainly taught us when we are told that He was made  under the law  for that expression always imports the authority of the law over its subjects To which we must add Christ was not only  bound to obey this law as a rule of life but in order to merit the reward of obedience This is what the scriptures usually intend by the phrase  "  Under the law  "  and there is no reason for understanding it differently when we are informed that Christ was  made under the law  Upon the contrary we have every reason for understanding the words in their usual sense for while he was fulfilling every jot and tittle of the law we see him not in the state of enjoying but of meriting the reward and he obtained it DECAUSE he had loved righteousness and hated iniquity  Heb  Consider now the Dignity of the Person who thus obeyed the law He is not a meer creature like those upon whom this law is binding He is the independent Jehovah  Jer  True he has  clothed himself in human nature but he is the same person still The person who made the world who supports all things by the word of his power whose sovereign will is the supreme law of the universethis is the PERSON who was made under the lawa law adapted to  creaturesmeer  creaturescreatures naturally below Angels and made far lower still by sinThis is the PERSON who  obeyed  this lawwho obeyed it as dictating the terms and condition of acquiring happiness And shall we say If He had not submitted to this as our substitute He must have done so as his own personal qualification Far be itHad man continued in his original purity and had our Creator been pleased to appear in our nature his holiness would no doubt incline him to love his imperfect image in sinless  man But this love would not be  obedience  to the moral law His appearing in human nature would not bring him so upon a level with his creatures that we might consider God and man as  neighbours  bound by the same precept and upon the same condition to mutual love Therefore when Immanuel was made under the law it must be that he might obey it as our substitute  This argument acquires additional weight when we consider our divine Surety as made under the law after the entrance of sin We have observed that the holiness of Immanuel would incline him to love his own image in  sinless  man but it would be perfectly consistent with his holiness to detest the whole human race after they became sinners and therefore to love sinful man in conformity to the moral  law could never be essential to the holiness of our incarnate God To what end then was he made under it Why must he fulfil every jot and tittle of this law Why must he do this in such a low obscure laborious and sorrowful state Why must he spend thirty years of his life in doing little else Why must he do this in the form of a servant working for a reward WhyBecause he was made under the law to redeem them that were under it  Altho' the objector cannot prove his point without refuting the foregoing argument yet I am at liberty to say that this argument is not essential to the doctrine I contend for I mean it is not so essential as that the truth of the doctrine depends upon itIf it were not blafphemy I might grant for sake of argument that the  incarnate God could not be holy if he had not been made under the moral lawif he had not obeyed that law in the manner in which we have seen he did obey it yet it would not follow from hence that he did not obey this law for us that is as our Surety and in our stead for since this law could have had no claim upon him if he had not been made mansince he was made man upon our accountand since his obedience is of infinitely greater merit than that of all the elect put together therefore no good reason can be given why he might not obey this law for himself if such a thing could be necessary and for us also This  alone  is a sufficient answer to the objection Yet we must remind the reader of what was said before and that we by no means give up the former argument for although holiness  was essential to our Redeemer's Sacrifice the obedience he yielded to the law was not essential to his own personal holiness he would have been perfectly holy if he had never been made under the law or bound to obey its precepts in the manner in which he did obey them  OBJECTION IV  "  IF Christ had obeyed the law as our Surety and that all through the previous course of his life it would have superceded the necessity of his expiatory sufferings and death for the law has not a double demand but an alternative requiring either perfect obedience or the suffering of its penalty  "  Answer  This objection is made up of truth and error connected together by false reasoning It is  not  true that our Suretie's obedience to the law could supercede the necessity of his sufferings and death because the wages of sin is deathIt  is  true that there are some cases in which the law has not a double demand but an alternative but these cases are so essentially different from the case of Christ and his people that it must be false reasoning  which concludes that no more can be demanded in one case than in the other But we shall be more particular  If a man could be found who had continued in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them certainly he would not deserve to suffer the penalty because in this case no sin has been committed But it is equally certain that those for whom Christ obeyed the law have sinned and this makes the difference  When a sinner has finished his course of tryal and filled up the measure of his iniquity then the divine law consigns him over to hopeless misery The "Alternative" does not run thus  Either obey the commandments or suffer the penalty and thou shalt obtain the reward  but rather thus  Obey or thou hast forfeited for ever the promised reward and also subjected thyself to endless misery    If obedience to the divine precepts as a condition of life as well as suffering the curse of a broken law are not both required of the damned it is because their case is hopelessthey are utterly rejected and shut up in eternal despair  Now I know of no other case but these two wherein the law does not make a double demand and these are each of them essentially different from the case of Christ and his people In the first of the two cases mentioned the law does not demand the personally righteous to suffer its penalty because they have not sinned In the second case the law does not require the damned to obey its precepts as a condition of life because the prospect of a reward is totally cut off from them But the case of Christ and his people stands thusThey have  sinned yet they do not suffer the penalty They have not perfectly obeyed the commandments yet they obtain the reward due to perfect obedience This difference is of such a nature as to demonstrate the fallacy of the reasoning in the objection To see the truth of this let us take the case wherein the law does not demand the suffering of its penalty and that wherein it does not demand obedience to its precepts as a condition of happiness and let us reason from each of these cases to that of Christ and his people In the first instance the argument will stand thus  The law does not require those to suffer its penalty who have obeyed its precepts and  NEVER SINNED  therefore it cannot require our Surety to obey its precepts and suffer its penalty altho' we  HAVE SINNEDIn the second instance the argument  runs thus  The law does not require the damned upon whom the penalty is inflicted to obey its precepts as a condition of life because  NO REWARD OF OBEDIENCE IS GIVEN OR HELD OUT TO THEM  therefore the law cannot require our Surety to suffer its penalty and obey its precepts although  THE REWARD OF OBEDIENCE IS GIVEN TO USA man who cannot see into the fallacy of this reasoning I can only say of him that his case is lamentable Others it is hoped will see that since the demerit of the damned and the reward of the righteous are both found in the case of a Christian therefore the work of his Surety must comprehend what answers to each that is the  penalty  and the  righteousness  of the law If not it is evident that the eternal law must be made void in one respect or other If our Surety had not suffered  for our sins and if nevertheless we were to escape the wrath to come it could no longer be said  "The wages of sin is death"  And if the commandments of the law are not obeyed for us and that perfectly and yet if we obtain the reward of perfect obedience where shall we find the obedience to which this reward is promised  I speak to men who are not vain enough to say that they themselves have yielded this perfect obedience  If thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments This is the language of that law concerning which it is saidTill heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled  That this is spoken of the commandments of the moral law cannot be disputed without great perverseness as is plain from all that follows in the chapter  Mat  OBJECTION V  "  IF Christ answered this twofold demand of the lawif he not only suffered the penalty but also obeyed its precepts and that as our Substitute how is it that the Scriptures so frequently ascribe our salvation to his sufferings  "  Answer  Because it was chiefly in suffering the penalty of the law that he obeyed its preceptsWhile he was growing up as a root out of a dry grounda man of sorrows and acquainted with griefwhile he suffered poverty that we might be made richwhile he suffered shame and reproach that we might escape bothwhile he was in agony that we might rejoicewhile he was stripped and scourged that we might be healedwhile he  was forsaken that we might be acceptedwhilein a word while he bore all our griefs and carried all our sorrows he was thereby manifesting the highest love to God and man which is the very essence of the moral law or eternal rule of Righteousness So that it is the same thing whether we say We are justified by his blood or We are made Righteous by his obedience The penalty and the commandments  must be distinguished  but in the obedience of our Surety they  cannot be separated  they include each other  OBJECTION VI  "  IT is granted that Christ in suffering for sin manifested the highest love to God and man but why should this love be considered as a fulfilment of the Moral Law  "  Answer  A side from his suretiship engagements I see no reason for considering his love in this light but since he stood in our place as our Head Representative and Surety it was necessary he should discharge every debt we owed so far as to give us a title to the forfeited reward and therefore  We are expressly told that God sent forth his son made of a woman  made under the law  Gal  and that he came into the world to fulfil this law  Mat  which  he could not do but by manifesting the highest love to God and man for LOVE  is the fulfilling of the Law  Rom  Hence also it is said  "The Lord is well pleased for his  Righteousness sake  he shall magnify the  Law  and make it honourable"  And again  "Christ is the end of the  Law  for  Righteousness  to every one that believeth"  Isa  Rom  OBJECTION VII  "  BUT if the inspired writers considered the work of Christ in this lightif they saw in the work he performed as our Surety not only the penalty of the law inflicted but also the righteousness of the law fulfilled then we might have expected to hear them ascribing salvation to this work considered sometimes in the former light and sometimes in the latter  "  Answer  The thing which we might have expected has actually come to pass In the scriptures the righteousness as well as the sufferings of our divine Surety every where meets our eye I shall here transcribe some passages after just observing that wherever salvation is ascribed to RIGHTEOUSNESS we may be sure it  is the righteousness of our Surety that is intended for it is  not by works of righteousness which  WE  have done  that we are saved  Tit  ADAM He was the Type of Him that was to come For if by one man's offence death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the Gift of  Righteousness  shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ  Rom  ABEL By  faith  he offered a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was  Righteous  Heb  NOAH He became heir of the  Righteousness  which is by saith  Heb  ABRAHAM He is the father of all  them that believe that  Righteousness  might be imputed to them also  Rom  MOSES The Righteousness which we obtain without works was  witnessed by the Law  and the Prophets even  the Righteousness of God  which is by saith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe  Rom  DAVID He described the blessedness  David described the  Effect  and Paul described the  Cause  David described the  Blessedness  of the man but Paul has described the medium through which this blessedness flowsThe  Blessedness  described by David is thisIniquity is forgiven sin is covered the meritorious cause of this as described by Paul is RIGHTEOUSNESS IMPUTED This was known to David also see  Psalm  Psalm  of the man unto whom the Lord imputeth  Righteousness  without works  Rom  ISAIAH Behold my servant whom  I uphold mine Elect in whom my soul delightethThe Lord is well pleased for his  Righteousness  sake He will magnisy the Law and make it honourable  Isa  Surely shall one say In the Lord have I  Righteousness  and strength  Isa  Hearken unto me ye stouthearted that are far from  Righteousness  I bring near  My Righteousness  it shall not be far off and my salvation shall not tarry and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory  Isa  Every tongue that shall rise in judgment against thee thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their  Righteousness  is of ME SAITH THE LORD  Isa  JEREMIAH Behold the days come saith the Lord that I will raise to David a Righteous Branch and a  King shall reign and prosper and shall execute justice and judgment in the earth In his days Judah shall be saved and Israel shall dwell safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS  Jer xxiii  DANIEL Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon the holy city to finish the transgression to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting  Righteousness  Dan ix  CHRIST  Think not that I am come to destroy the  Law  or the Prophets I am not come to destroy but to fulfil FOR verily I say unto you Till heaven and earth pass one jot or one one tittle shall in no wise pass from the LAW till all be fulfilled  Mat  THE FOUR EVANGELISTS They tell us of all things that Jesus began both to Do and Teach until the day in which he was taken up into heaven for an abstract of which I refer to the first part of this Essay  ACTS OF THE APOSTLES In this book we have the substance of what the Apostles preached unto sinners and by which they were to be saved In  six  of their sermons or discourses we find them careful to lay before their hearers not only the sufferings but also the righteousness of Christ In these discourses he is three times emphatically called THE HOLY ONE OF GOD  Acts ii Chap iii and xiii  and as often THE JUST ONE  Acts Chap vii and xxii  Peter gives a short but comprehensive and beautiful description of his character when he  says  He went about doing good  Acts  and also when he calls him  A man approved of God  Acts  If it should be objected that although these teachers represent Christ as an Holy Just or Righteous person yet they do not in these discourses expressly affirm that he wrought his righteousness in the capacity of our head representative or Surety I reply neither do they in these discourses expressly affirm that he  suffered  in this capacity One answer will equally suit his righteousness and sufferings The truth is there was no necessity for the Apostles to affirm in these discourses more expressly than they have done that Christ obeyed or suffered  for  sinners because when they preached the righteousness and sufferings of Christ as the ground of hope telling the people that  Through his name  whosoever believed in him should receive the remission of sins  Acts  and that  By him  all that believe are justified from all things  Acts  when the people heard this I say as many of them as understood it would easily see that Christ must have stood in the capacity of our Surety for it is this that lays a foundation for our being justified through him  ROMANS The doctrine of Imputed Righteousness appears in this Epistle not only to be a doctrine of Christianity but also to be one of the most important and fundamental doctrines of that religion For the sake of introducing this doctrine the Apostle sets himself to prove that the whole world is become guilty before God  Rom Read from chap to chap  and he makes the forgiveness of sin  Rom  justification  Rom  and eternal life  Rom  depend upon imputed righteousness and when he bewails the case of his brethren the jews it is because they were ignorant of this doctrine  Rom and chap  The Righteousness which is imputed to the believer is worthy of being made  so much  account of The incarnate God is the Lord our Righteousness  Jer  The righteousness which is unto and upon all them that believe is the righteousness of God  Rom  Cor  Philip  Pet  The righteousness which is bestowed as a gift and which is upon all men who believe is the righteousness of one Jesus Christ  Rom  This is the Person who is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth  Rom  And it is through his righteousness that grace reigns unto eternal life  Rom  Although the scriptures in general and the Epistle before us in particular are so very full and plain upon this yet some men will remind us in a way of  opposition  that FAITH  is imputed for righteousness  But the Apostle must be understood in a way consistent with himselfIt is a common thing with all writers to use one and the same word to express an  Object  and the  faculty  or affection which regards that object Hence the words  fear hope joy peace love  c are used indifferently to express the objects of these affections and these affections themselves God is called the  fear  of his people  Gen  Isa  because they sear him Christ is our  hope  Tim  because we hope for happiness through him He is our  peace  Eph  because we enjoy peace with God through him c So also the word  faith  is  used indifferently to express the  Truth  which we believe and our  belief  of the truth So that it is the same thing whether we say  Faith  is come  Gal  or  Christ  is comeIt is the same thing whether we sayPaul preached the  Faith  Gal  or He preached  Christ  It is the same thing whether we say we are Justified  by Faith  Rom  or  By Him  all that believe are justified  Acts  It is the same thing whether we say  Faith  is imputed for righteousness  Rom  or  Christ  is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth  Rom  CORINTHIANS Of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us Wisdom and  Righteousness  and Sanctification and Redemption that according as it is written He that  glorieth let him glory in the Lord  Cor  If the ministration of condemnation be glory much more doth the ministration of  Righteousness  exceed in glory  Cor  God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation Now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech you by us we pray you in Christ's stead be ye reconciled to God For he hath made him to be sin for us who know no sin that we might be made  the Righteousness of God in him  Cor  GALATIANS When the fulness of the time was come God sent forth  his Son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sonsAnd if sons then heirs of God thro' Christ  Gal  PHILIPIANS Christ Jesus being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross  Philip  For whom says Paul I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ and be found in him not having  mine own righteousness  which  is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ the  Righteousness which is of God  by faith  Philip  HEBREWS Unto the Son he saith Thy throne O God is for ever and ever a Sceptre of  Righteousness  is the Sceptre of thy Kingdom Thou hast  loved Righteousness  and  hated iniquity  THEREFORE God even thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows  Heb  Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec  Psalms    first  KING OF RIGHTEOUSNESS and  after that  KING OF PEACE  Heb  PAUL'S HOPE IN DEATH I have kept the faith hence forth there is laid up for me a  Crown of Righteousness  Tim  Compare this with Phillipians and Revelations  PETER a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us in the  Righteousness  of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ  Pet  JOHN These things write I unto you that ye sin not And if any man sin we have an Advocate with the Father Jesus Christ  the Righteous  and he is the propitiation for our sins  John  REVELATIONS These things saith the AMENI counsel thee to buy OF ME gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and  white raiment  that thou mayest be cloathed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear  Rev  Let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready And  to her was  granted  that she should be  arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the Righteousness of the saints  Rev  Upon this ground we may sayI will greatly rejoice in the Lord my soul shall be joyful in my God for he hath cloathed me with the garments of Salvation he hath covered me with the ROBE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments and as a bride adorneth herself with jewels Isa lxi Thus we see how this doctrine runs through the whole Bible  OBJECTION VIII  "  THE  DEATH of  Christ is that obedience by which we are made righteous Christ's death was a voluntary act of obedience to the commandment of his Father so he says  "Therefore doth my Father love me because I lay down my life that I might take it again No man taketh it from me but I lay it down of myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again This commandment have I received of my Father"  The will of God which he came to do and by which his people are sanctified was the offering up of his body once By this act of obedience he at once fulfilled the law to the utmost exercising the perfection of love to God and man and satisfying all its penal demands upon his guilty people The spotless holiness of his heart and life qualified him for this obedience and the divine dignity of his person gave it infinite worth and efficacy  See Mr M'CLEAN'S illustration of the Commission given by Christ to the Apostles page    In his life says this Author in another place he obeyed  the law for us as our  example  but in his death he obeyed it for us as our substitute the holiness of his heart and life in conformity to the moral law qualified him for performing that obedience by which we are made righteous but in his death he actually performed itAnd although I could have no hope from his death or mediation did I not consider him as perfectly holy and free from sin through the whole course of his life yet I do not find that the scriptures ascribe our justification directly to this but always to what he did in his death  "  Answer  Some things in this objection have been already considered viz what is said about Immanuel  qualifying  himself in holiness by his obedience to the moral law and also what is said of his obedience to the law as an  example  I mention these particulars now only to make other parts of the  objection more plain to the Reader for I find that many persons who read the book referred to above do not understand the Author upon the subject in hand The  Argument  contained in the objection shall be considered presently but I shall first make a few observations upon the  sentiment  which that argument is intended to support  This sentiment understood in the most favourable light will stand thusChrist did not begin to act as the Surety or Substitute of his people until about the time of his  death  his foregoing obedience and sufferings were not substitutional but intended for our example and for his own personal qualification but in his death he suffered the penalty and also obeyed the commandments of the moral law as his people's substitute and in their  stead And if we ask How could he obey the commandments of the moral law in his  death  the answer isIn his death he manifested the perfection of love to God and man which is the end of the commandment and the fulfilling of the law  This appears to me to be a very dangerous sentiment It seems to approach so near the Truth and it is supported in some instances by such plausible reasoning and by so able an Advocate that those who are weak in the Faith are in danger of being carried away by itBut the Good Shepherd has saidMy sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any pluck them out of my hand  This sentiment is I suppose  perfectly  new  It is no new thing indeed to deny that Christ fulfilled the commandments of the moral law in his people's stead but it is of  late  that we have been told he did this in his death only and not in his life I cannot speak with absolute certainty upon the  novelty  of this sentiment but am of opinion that it was not thought of until the close of the eighteenth Century It has not however come too late to find footing in the world for it seems to be adopted by several congregations in north and south Britain and perhaps it may give birth to another denomination of Christians  At times I fancy I understand this sentiment pretty clearly but at other times I find myself rather at a loss This uncertainty is owing to the principles upon which this sentiment is  sometimes desended and from which it's Advocates reason in order to oppose what they call the common popular doctrine for these principles seem to me as inconsistent with their own doctrine as with that which they reject For instance  Christ's obedience to the law is set before us as an  example  for us to copy after which shews  they  say that he did not obey this law as our substitute in his  life  Now these same people know that Christ's obedience in his  death  is also set before us as an example to copy after how then can  they  believe that he obeyed this law even in his death  as our substitute  They tell us that if Christ had obeyed the law for us in his life it would have superseded his expiatory sufferings StrangeBut waving all other remarks what is the reason that  Christ's vicarious obedience to the law in his life should supersede his expiatory sufferings and yet his vicarious obedience to the law in his death should  not  supersede themTo this it has been replied  "His fulfilling the law for us in his death includes his expiatory sufferings and therefore cannot supersede them"  But this answer leaves me just where I was To tell me that  The suffering of the penalty is included in Christ's vicarious obedience to the precepts of the law  is not to shew me  the use and necessity of this  which is the thing I am inquiring after It is the opinion of the Objector that if Christ had obeyed the precepts of the law in his life as our substitute then his sufferings considered as expiatory would be superfluous Seeing this is his opinion and seeing he professes to believe that Christ did  obey these precepts  for us  that is as our substitute in his death I am at a loss to conceive what necessity  he  finds for the sufferings of Christ  considered as expiatory  To tell me that his obedience to the law in his death includes his expiatory sufferings is only to provoke a repetition of the questionWhywhy must this substitutional obedience include expiatory sufferings Or seeing this obedience does in fact include these sufferings how is it that the former does not render the latter superfluous  When we plead for our Suretie's vicarious obedience and sufferings all through his life even unto death the Objector tells us that it is impossible to shew where the law makes this  "  double demand  "  He insists upon it that the law has not a double demand but an alternative requiring either  perfect obedience or else the suffering of its penalty  I have considered this sentiment before and mention it in this place only to point out the Objector s inconsistency  This way of talking makes it very difficult to understand what these people intend to admit One would think that what is here said makes as much against their own sentiment as it does against ours and when they are reminded of this their explanation only tends to involve their sentiment in complicated obscurity When we tell them that their own sentiment also infers a double demand of the law upon the sinner's Surety they seem inclined to admit that it does so but not  such  a double demand as we plead for and they say that the double demand which they admit may be reduced to a  single  one Upon this I would observe  If they realy intend to admit  that Christ did at any time living or dying not only bear the curse but also sulfil the precepts of the law  as our substitute  this is the double demand we plead for The difference between the life and death of Christ affects not the question concerning a  double  demand of the law for it is not length of time but the two things demanded which constitute the  double  demand If our Surety had  only  to obey the precepts or if he had  only  to suffer the penalty of the law this would be but a  single  demand although he had been bound thus to obey or else to suffer all through life even unto death and upon the other hand if he was bound to obey and also to suffer for us this is a  double  demand although he had thus obeyed and suffered only in the hour of death  When they talk of reducing  what they seem to admit to a  single  demand I am altogether at a loss to know their method of doing so If I were acquainted with their method of reducing I could try it upon my own view of this doctrine but as I do not my sentiment must needs remain as it is What their's will look like after it is reduced I cannot tell but it seems that  To be consistent with themselves they must not only reduce a double demand to a single one but that single one must be an  alternative  in contradistinction to a double demand that is Obedience to the precepts of the law including the suffering of it's penalty must be reduced to either one or the other of these two for they say The law has not a double demand but an  alternative  requiring  either perfect obedience or else  the  suffering of it's penalty  But whatever obscurity may attend this sentiment in other respects one thing is plain viz It stands opposed to the belief of our Suretie's having acted in our name all through his state of humiliationfrom the time he was made under the law to redeem until he said  It is Finished  I am not sure indeed from whence  they  date the commencement of his substitutional work  when  he finished the righteousness which according to them is appropriated to his own personal qualification and  when  he began the other righteousness unto which our justification is directly ascribed but their argument seems to confine the latter to his death meaning thereby I suppose the whole of his voluntary sufferings from the time he was nailed to the cross until his resurrection Taking the sentiment in this view we are  now to consider the main argument upon which it rests It is said  "The scriptures do not ascribe our justification directly to what Christ did through the whole course of his life but always to what he did in his death"  To this we reply  The inspired writers do indeed and that very frequently ascribe our justification and salvation to what Christ did in his death and considering his death as the  completion  of his substitutional undertaking it would be strange if they did not ascribe our justification to it But when the inspired writers ascribe our justification to the death of Christ how does it appear that they intend to  exclude  as  substitutional  his foregoing obedience and sufferings  To ascribe salvation in all it's parts to the death of Christ and to believe  at the same time that Christ acted as our Surety all through his state of humiliation are not such inconsistent things as to render it impossible for an accurate speaker or writer to do both Indeed I do not know an author of any note who held the doctrine I contend for but what does nevertheless ascribe our salvation to what Christ did in his  death  I shall give a few instances out of many  OWEN Mercy Pardon and Grace could find no other way to issue forth from the heart of the Father but by the heart's  blood  of the Son  WITSIUS A right to all the blessings of the covenant of grace was purchased  at once  to all the elect by Christ's  death  MC LAURIN We must believe that Salvation is the purchase of Christs  death  HERVEY The  death  of Christ procured  the pardon and acceptance of believers  SANDEMAN Ask a Christian What is his faith the spring of all his hope He answers you in a word The  Blood  of Christ  BOOTH O remember that grace has erected her throne This forbids despair For her wonderful throne is erected not in the ruins of justice not on the dishonour of the law but on the  Blood  of the Lamb  Now it is well known that these Authors had no intention to  confine  the Suretiship of Christ to his death It is well known that they considered Christ as the substitute of sinners all through his state of humiliation yet they ascribe salvation in all it's parts to his  death  in language  as strong  as that used by the ApostlesThe intelligent reader will readily perceive how far I intend this argument should go I have no thoughts of supporting any  doctrine by human authority and therefore I do not quote these Authors to that end It is sufficient if they are allowed to be men who knew how to express their own thoughts with propriety of speech and that they have actually done so upon this occasion And why should not this be admitted They considered the  death  of Christ as the  completion  of his vicarious work and in this view they ascribe salvation to it Is this to express their own thoughts improperly I suppose no one will say so What does this prove It proves that to ascribe salvation to the death of Christ does not amount to a denial of his having acted as our substitute all through his state of humiliation and consequently when the Apostles ascribed salvation to his death it does not prove that they intended  to exclude as substitutional his foregoing obedience and sufferingsI may here remind our opposers of what certain of their  own  poets have said and which they themselves repeatedly sing viz  " Tis  finished  THIS  his dying groan  " Shall sins of every kind atone  " Millions shall be redeem'd from death  " By THIS  his  LAST  expiring breath  "  The reasoner who should attempt to prove from this verse that the poet who made or that the persons who sing it consider nothing in the sufferings of Christ as substitutional but his dying groan and last expiring breath would serve the poet and those who adopt his words as some men do the apostles  It is past dispute that the scriptures do in other casescases too  which are closely connected with that in hand ascribe effects to the  death  of Christ which belong also to the whole of his humiliation obedience and sufferings For instance Christ is represented as saying  "Therefore doth my Father love me  because I lay down my life  "  John  Does this warrant us to say that laying down his life was the  only  thing for which his Father loved him No verily not even though we should soften the matter by adding the words  "immediately and directly"  For all that Christ did upon the earth were immediate and direct causes of the Father's love  Luke Chap  John Chap and  Again Paul says  "Jesus was crowned with glory and honour  for the suffering of death  "  Heb  Does this warrant us to say that his death  was the  only  direct cause for which he was crowned Was he not highly exalted for the  whole  of his humiliation obedience and sufferings  Phil  for loving righteousness and hating iniquity  Heb  for  all  that he did to glorify his Father upon the earth  John  Certainly he was yet the scriptures ascribe it to his  death  Therefore when the scriptures ascribe  salvation  to the death of Christ why should we not understand them as including his foregoing obedience and sufferings To understand the scriptures thus is only to take them for their own interpreter and to explain what they say of the death of Christ in one place by what we are sure they intend in another  When the scriptures ascribe salvation to the  death  of Christ it cannot  be with a view to exclude as substitutional his foregoing obedience and sufferings because it is impossible to find an adequate cause or end for this obedience or for these sufferings especially some of them without admitting that they were substitutional For instance What adequate cause or end shall we find for his dreadful sufferings in the garden and from thence to Calvary if we deny that they were substitutional Was it merely for the sake of setting us an example and qualifying himself in holiness that he began to be sore amazed and very heavy that his soul was exceeding sorrowful even unto death that he was in an agony and sweat great drops of blood falling to the ground that he was taken from hence bound smitten spit upon blindsolded mocked stripped  and scourgedIf the Objector should admit that these instances of suffering were substitutional he must then abandon his argument and be reduced to the necessity of begging the question for these sufferings were no more undergone  on the tree  than were any other sufferings of our Redeemer's life And it must be noticed that the Apostles not only ascribe our salvation to his last sufferings and  death  but also expressly to what he endured while hanging on the Tree  Gal  But if the Objector should go so far as to deny that the sufferings of Christ in the garden and from thence until he was led forth to be crucified were substitutional he ought to provide a good reason for so doing which I am persuaded is absolutely impossible I conclude therefore that  when the scriptures ascribe our justification to the  death  of Christ it is not with any intention to exclude as substitutional his foregoing obedience and sufferings  But the Objector has not only said that the scriptures always ascribe our justification to the  death  of Christ but also that they never ascribe it directly to his foregoing obedience and sufferings We have therefore now to consider what authority he has for this part of his argument In doing this I shall lay before the reader some passages of scripture which appear to ascribe our salvation to the  sufferings  of Christ  in general  and make some further observations upon the  Righteousness  of our divine Surety  First  I shall lay before the reader some passages of scripture which appear  to ascribe our justification and salvation to the  sufferings  of Christ  in general  Poverty Persecutions  and  Temptations  are remarkable instances of the sufferings of Christ and the scriptures ascribe our salvation to each of them  Poverty  "Ye know the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich"  Cor  Now Christ  became  poor when he was born of a woman brought forth in a stable and laid in a manger he  continued  poor all through his life upon this earth and at length died in the most dreadful kind of poverty When any period of this state of poverty is contrasted with his  original state and with what he had a right to enjoy as the Son of the Highest from the first moment of his birth it ought not to be esteemed a small matter We should also remember that a state of life such as our divine Surety led in this world was part of the original curse pronounced upon sinful man  "Cursed is the ground for thy sake in  sorrow  shalt thou eat of it ALL THE DAYS OF THY LIFE Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth unto thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return"  Gen  Persecution  "Let not them that  wait on thee O Lord God of hosts be ashamed  for my sake  let not those that seek thee be confounded  for my sake  O God of Israel BECAUSE for thy sake I have born reproach shame hath covered my face  Psalm    Upon this text we have to observe Christ is the speaker He is praying for his people who deserve eternal shame and confusion of face because they have sinned against God The reason why this shame and confusion is not to come upon his people to whom it belonged is because their Surety bore reproach shame covered his face Now although this took place in its most eminent degree upon the Cross it is plain from the context that Christ is here speaking of  all  that shame and reproach which he endured upon the earthIt is past dispute  with those who admit the authority of the New Testament that the sufferings mentioned in this Psalm upon the ground of which our Advocate intercedes are the sufferings of Christ  in general  Compare verse with John And verse with John  Temptations  "In all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful High Priest in things pertaining to God  to make reconciliation for the sins  of the people  for in that he himself hath  SUFFERED  being  TEMPTED he is able to succour them that are tempted"  Heb  It is readily granted that the  succour  here mentioned includes that continual support relief and protection which the tempted christian receives  from Christ who learned by painful experience how to feel for his people but it is plain that this is not the only nor yet the chief thing which the Apostle teaches The particulars which relate to the case in hand are Paul ranks the temptations which Christ endured amongst his  sufferings  These sufferings are amongst the  all things  in which it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren to the end he might  make reconciliation for the sins of the people  Now Christ was tempted not only in his death but in all points like as we are  Heb  By what authority then do we exclude from his atonement all those temptations which he endured before his death and particularly those of which we read when he was led into the wilderness away from the habitations of  men  to be tempted  of the chief of the infernal spirits In this horrid situation he continued during forty days and nights without foodHow different this from the delightful abode of sinless Adam How different from the proper habitation of Adam's Lord This indeed is a fit situation for guilt and despair but how came the Holy One of God in such a placein such company  "Surely he hath born our griefs and carried our sorrows"  Isa  This chapter gives a comprehensive view of the sufferings of Christ  from first to last  from his growing up as a tender plant to his being cut off out of the land of the living It speaks of the mean and despised appearence of the Messiah while  growing up  as a root out of a dry ground  Isa  of the general  hatred and contempt with which he should be treated  Isa verse  of the sorrows and griefs which were to be his constant companions  Isa verse  of his being wounded bruised and scourged  verse  of his being brought as a lamb to the slaughtertaken from prison and Judgmentand cut off c  verse  Now the prophet was sure that all these griefs and all these sorrows were  ours  He knew that these afflictions could not come upon him without an adequate cause and although the jews in general thought that Jesus of Nazareth deserved them all although they esteemed him as one stricken smitten of God for his own sins and afflicted yet the prophet knew that he was no less a person than Immanuel  Isa  the mighty God  chap  and that his condition in this world  was infinitely below and contrary to his own true character and consequently that every kind and degree of sufferings which he endured must be  ours  The Messiah was presented to the thoughts of this prophet as growing up in the meanest condition a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief but says he Surely these are  our  sorrows  our  griefs  Isa  he saw him wounded and bruised but when or wheresoever this was Isaiah was confident it must be for  our iniquities  verse  he saw him scourged but he knew that these stripes were to be our healing  verse  he saw him at length as a lamb brought to the slaughter and as a criminal led from prison and judgment to the fatal the accursed tree but he knew that in this as in every other instance it was for the transgressions of God's people that he was stricken  verse    I think the man must be rather perverse who will insist upon it that this chapter speaks  only  of the sufferings of Christ in his  death  or that all the sufferings mentioned are not referred to our sins as the cause and to our salvation as the end  "Our High Priest in the days of his flesh offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he seared though he were a Son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the Author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him"  Heb  This chapter from the first verse to the ninth consists of two parts a description of the office and duties of the high priest under the law  verse  the application of this to  the Person and Priesthood of Christ  Heb verse  I do not intend to enter fully into the discussion of this remarkable portion of scripture my limits only admit and my design only requires that I point out such circumstances as go to prove that the sufferings of Christ  in general  are included in his expiatory sacrifice and that our salvation is ascribed to his death on the cross considered as the  perfecting  and not as the  only  instance of his expiatory sufferings  The Apostle is evidently speaking of Christ under the character of a PRIEST by which he leads us to consider all the sufferings he mentions in this place as belonging to the atonement made by Christ for the sins of the people  verse  The Apostle mentions the  time  in which our High Priest endured these  sufferings viz  the days of his flesh  Heb  Now the DAYS  of his flesh  are more than the HOURS of his crucifixionthe days of his flesh are the days of his humiliation wherein he appeared in the form of sinful flesh  Rom  a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief  The sufferings of which the Apostle speaks in this place and which he represents as belonging to Christ's priestly office are of such a nature that we have reason to believe he certainly did endure them all through the days of his fleshHe offered up prayers and supplications with  crying  with  strong  cryingwith strong crying and  tears  Heb  Now compare this with the history of Christ's life given by the Evangelists There we read of his sending the multitude away dismissing his disciples also  and then retiring not to repose after the labours of the day but to a desert mountain to pray and continuing there until about the fourth watch of the night  Mat  At another time we read of his rising up in the morning a great while before day and departing into a solitary place to pray  Mark  And again we are told of his going out into a mountain to pray and continuing  all night  in prayer to God  Luke  Now from these instances we should conclude that it was common for him thus to spend his nights Indeed the Evangelist in one place telling us of his retiring at night to the mount of Olives says expressly  "  As he was wont  "  Luke  The last night which the Saviour of sinners spent in prayer to God he permitted three of his disciples to be with him and we know the awful  account they give of what they saw and heardthis was in the garden of Gethsemane I do not positively affirm that all his nightly prayers were attended with  equal  sorrows but this I know that the Apostle speaks in a  general  way when he tells us of the state of mind in which our High Priest offered up his prayers and supplications When he tells us they were offered up with  strong crying and tears  he does not appear to be speaking of what was done on some one particular occasion but he seems to be speaking in general of what he did  in the days of his flesh  Moreover these prayers and supplications which our High Priest offered up with strong crying and tears were a subject of  Prophecy  and they are spoken of as being offered up  day and night incessantly  Thus the Redeemer weeps  "O my God I cry unto thee in the  day time  but thou  hearest not  and in the  nightseason  and  am not silent  Psalm  Upon these memorable words I would make the following remarks We are sure that Jesus is the speaker This bitter complaint cannot refer meerly to the scene in Gethsemane because that scene took place at  night  and the complaint is  "O my God I cry in the  daytime  "  Neither can it refer  only  to what Jesus suffered on the Cross because he was taken down from the Cross  before sunset  and the complaint is  "I cry in the daytime and in the  nightseason  "  This complaint cannot well be  confined  to any one particular day and night because the words are more properly expressive of daily continued sorrow  O my God I cry unto thee  in the day time but thou hearest not and in the night season and am not silent  "  This way of speaking calls to our mind what the Evangelists tell us of his continuing whole nights in prayer on mountains and in solitary places and of this being his usual custom It appears from this  second  verse of the twentysecond Psalm that our Redeemer had occasion more than once to use the words of the  first  verse viz My God my God why hast thou forsaken me c We have just now mentioned some considerations which go to prove that the complaint uttered in the  second  verse cannot be  confined  to the awful scene in Gethsemane nor yet to that on the Cross and if the  second  verse cannot be thus confined no more can the  first  as may appear from hence The two verses seem to be closely connected together and to  form  one  complaint  "My God my God why hast thou forsaken me why art thou so far from helping me and from the words of my roaring O my God I cry in the day time but thou hearest not and in the night season and am not silent"  Does not the suffering Redeemer connect in this instance his  unheard cries  with his being  forsaken of God  And when he himself complains of crying thus unto God  day and night continually  shall  we  say He never had occasion thus to complain except during the six hours in which he hung upon the Cross Let it be far from christians to contradict their Lord in any thing and especially when his sufferings are in question When he intimates in any particular instance that he suffered for our sins the least we can do is to acknowledge that he did so  And being made perfect continues the Apostle he became the Author of eternal salvation  And being made perfect  this is just the form of expression which we might have expected if as we maintain the Apostle had been speaking of our Great High Priest as gradually advancing all through the days of his flesh in the great work of Atonement Considering all the sufferings of his life in this light it was natural to add  and being made perfect  Our Great High Priest was made perfect by his last sufferings on the Cross where according to his own words he  Finished  his work Being thus made perfect he became the Author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him By this one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified There is no need of repeating this sacrifice  like those which were offered under the law for then must he often have suffered  since the foundation of the world  but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself And as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvationI shall conclude what I have to say upon the  sufferings  of Christ in the words of WITSIUS not with any view to strengthen the argument by the authority of his Name but because he expresses my own views more clearly perhaps than I could have done myself  "I remember to have learned" says he "in the communion of the reformed church to the following effect  st That the death wherewith God threatned man for sin comprizes in its whole extent all that misery which by the justest despleasure of God has followed upon sin and to which the sinner man is obnoxious all his life the principal part of which consists in the want of the favour of God and in the keenest sense of the divine curse to be chiefly inflicted when it shall so please God dly That Christ by the interposition of his engagements for the elect took upon himself all that curse which man was liable to on account of sin hence it was that in order to the payment of the debt he engaged for he led a life in the assumed human nature subject to many vicissitudes of misery just like the life of a human sinner dly That as God uses much forbearance with respect to sinners and moderates the  bitterness of life with some sweetness of patience till the day of vengeance and of the retribution of his righteous judgment when the whole weight of the curse shall light upon the condemned sinner so also Christ when in the form of sinful flesh had not always the same sense of the painful effects of the sins that were laid upon him but sometimes rejoiced in an eminent mixture of favour till the hour and power of darkness came when being called to the bar he had every thing dreadful to undergo thly That as the death which consists in the separation of the soul and body is inflicted on the sinner man as the fad effect of the wrath of God so in like manner Christ underwent the same death that in this respect also making satisfaction to divine justice he might remove all the curse  of that death from the elect thly In fine that as all those miseries taken together are what sin deserves so Christ who by his engagement took upon himself all the debt of the elect did by all these miseries to which he was subject all his life satisfy divine justice so that taken all together they constitute the ransom which was due for our sinsAll the sufferings which Christ endured both in soul and body through the whole course of his life constitute his one and perfect satisfaction though it be certain that those were the most greivous sufferings with which he encountred on the last night and day and that what he bore in his body were far exceeded by those that oppressed his soul just as the whole of Christ's most holy obedience is imputed to us for righteousness tho' he gave an  eminent demonstration of it when he was obedient in death"  We come now  Secondly  to make some further observations upon the  Righteousness  of our Divine Surety I do not intend to enter fully into the consideration of this glorious Subject if I had ability suited to such a task my limits would not admit of it All that I intend is to propose one argument more taken from what the Scriptures say of the  Righteousness  of Christ in reply to the Objection now before us  The Objector will not admit that Christ obeyed and suffered all through his life upon earth as the Surety or Substitute of sinners He cannot find he says that the Scriptures ascribe our justification directly to what Christ did in his life but always to what he did in his deathIn reply to this we  have shewn that when the Scriptures ascribe our justification to the death of Christ it is not with any intention to exclude as substitutional his foregoing obedience and sufferings That the Scriptures do in many places ascribe our justification and salvation to the sufferings of Christ in general that is to  all  the sufferings he endured in the days of his humiliation To these considerations we have now to add what we have before proved that our justification is ascribed and that "  directly  " to the Righteousness of Christ This alone one might imagine is sufficient to decide this question But the Objector has found out a new way to evade the force of this argument Hitherto the question has beenIs the Righteousness of Christ including his sufferings the immediate and  direct cause of our justification This question being decided in the affirmative the dispute was ended The reason was there existed no dispute about what was meant by the  Righteousness  of Christ It was admitted upon all hands that the Righteousness of Christ is his conformity to the Rule of Righteousness or in other words the whole of his obedience to the Moral Law For men had not as yet learned to distinguish between his obedience to the precepts of the moral law in his life and his obedience to the precepts of the moral law in his death and to assign different kinds of influence to this obedience in the justification of the ungodly But by the help of these distinctions the Objector can admit in words that our justification is ascribed directly to the Rightcousness of Christ and yet  deny that it is directly  The Reader must impute the frequent repetition of the word "  directly  " to the singularity of the sentiment I am opposing  ascribed to the holiness of his heart and life in conformity to the moral law  If the Reader doubts whether this be a fair re+presentation let him read the Objector's own words page  of this Essay  So that it is not enough for us to prove that the scriptures ascribe our justification directly to the Righteousness of Christ we must also prove that the Righteousness of Christ is the whole of his conformity to that Rule of Righteousness under which he was madewhich one would think is so self evident that it does not require and that it hardly admits of proof It is almost like attempting to prove that the Righteousness of Christ isthe Righteousness of Christ And perhaps some Readers may  blame me for saying any more upon a subject which is already so plain Such as are thus minded may here close the book To others we shall propose the following remarks  The Righteousness of which we speak is the Righteousness of CHRIST It is not the Righteousness of the Eternal WORD considered  only  as God and as the Governor of the World but it is that Righteousness which this Person wrought in our nature after he was made of a woman and  while he was under the Law  It is that Righteousness of his which consists in a  perfect conformity to every jot and title of the Law  If it be askedIs every action of his life from his birth to his death included in this Righteousness I answer directly YES Upon which I fancy I hear some exclaimWhat did he conform  to the  Ceremonial  Law as our Substitute Did he work miracles as our SubstituteYes  in so far as his conformity to the  MORAL  Law was concerned in these things  When he attended to the ceremonial law he did so in obedience to the command of God which is not a ceremonial but  moral  duty  Cor vii  And while he wrought miracles he was going about doing good  Acts x  which is also a  moral  dutyBut the moral law never bound  us  to observe the ceremonial law it never bound  us  to work miraclesTrue but it bound us to obey God and to do good to man and it is only in this sense that we consider the Righteousness of Christ as concerned in Ceremonies and MiraclesIndeed these things are very inconsistently objected to us by the persons we now speak to  They  also  profess to believe that Christ obeyed the moral law as our substitute And how do they say he did thisBy dying to redeem lost sinnersBut the moral law never commanded us to perform such a work as this This was the greatest miracle of all Yet if any one was to object this to them they would and very justly consider it as an impertinent cavil At least they would know how to answer it and one answer will equally suit us both Neither party need be afraid if the only thing that can be objected to us is that Christ obeyed the law for us in a different and far more excellent manner than could be expected from usthis is our Glory The Righteousness of our Divine Surety does not exceed that which was demanded of the Elect more than his  Person  exceeds their persons  But who ever objected to the Suretiship of Christ meerly upon account of the excellency of his Person Yea I have heard one man and only one go thus far  "I cannot admit the doctrine of imputed righteousness" he said "for this reasonThe works of an  Infinite  Person cannot be imputed to one that is finite"  But this seems to proceed upon a mistaken notion of the nature of that imputation of which we speak It is indeed impossible that any finite person should perform the works which are peculiar to one who is infinite And as the judgment of God is always according to truth it is equally impossible that he should  so  impute the Righteousness of Christ unto us as to judge that this Righteousness is our own  personal  work This therefore is not what the scriptures teach neither  is it what any christian pleads forBut it was not impossible for the Eternal Word who is an infinite Person to take on him a finite nature to unite himself to his elect and become their surety it was not impossible for him in their nature and as their Surety to obey every jot and tittle of the moral law and suffer its penalty nor is it impossible for God to impute this unto the persons for whom it was done that is it is not impossible for God to place it to their account and upon this ground to justify them from all things from which they could not be justified by their own personal performances This is not impossible but divinely trueThe Righteousness of our Incarnate God is  "unto and upon all them that believe"  but neither he who wrought nor he who imputes this  Righteousneis nor they unto whom it is imputed ever mistake it for the workmanship of a finite person It is  ours  because it was wrought for us and is imputed unto us not because it is our own personal performance There is indeed such a close union between Christ and his elect that because he died rose and reigns and because his Righteousness is divine they also are represented as dead risen reigning and as made the Righteousness of God but they are all this IN HIM who is their Head and Representative To obey and suffer  in the second Adam  is one thing and to do so  in our own Persons  is anotherConsidering therefore the nature and grounds of this imputation the infinity of the Person of our Surety is so far from making the imputation of his Righteousness impossible that  the reverse is true for had he been a meer creature he could have yeilded no obedience to the law of God beyond what was necessary for himself much less could he make reconciliation for the innumerable sins of the whole redeemed company and work a Righteousness which should be adequate to the demands of the law upon them all It was necessary indeed that he should be  man  for otherwise he could neither obey the precepts nor suffer the penalty of the law given to man but it was his DIVINITY that gave sufficient worth and efficacy to the wholeThere is then a likeness and there is also a difference between the  Person  of our Surety and our persons and there is also a likeness and a difference between what the law demanded of us and what he performed as our Surety  As the children were partakers of flesh and blood he also himself took part of the same as we were under the law he was made under it as the law bound us to  continue  in  all  things that are written therein he came to fulfil  every jot and tittle  of the law and he  always  did those things that were pleasing in his Father's fight and as we were exposed to the righteous curse of a broken law so the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all and he suffered the just for the unjust Thus far there is a likeness But mark the difference we were mere creatures He was the Great Creator the obedience which the law demanded of us was only the obedience of mere men but His is the Righteousness of God because we could never satisfy divine justice for our sins we were doomed to endless  misery but he being fully able to do this his sufferings had an end  I think it has been proved that Christ  suffered  for the sins of his people not only in his  death  but also through the whole course of his life consequently he must have stood as our Surety all that time and if he did so in suffering the penalty of the law why not in obeying its precepts  I think we have also proved that the Incarnate God had no occasion to obey the moral law for himself at least not in the manner in which he did obey it all through his state of humiliation consequently it was for us he did so and not for himself  Although the love which Christ manifested in his death is undoubtedly included in his Righteousness and is the most eminent instance of it  yet we cannot think that this was all he intended when he said he came to fulfil  every jot and tittle  of the law This expression evidently includes not only the  "  weightier matters of the law  "  such as perfect love to God and man but also all  "  the least of those commandments  "  wherein that love should be expressed And we find that the Righteousness of Christ does in fact answer to the most minute as well as the most important duties of the law It is universal and in every respect perfect Neither the greatest nor the least precept was neglected by him He laid down his life for his brethren in obedience to the high command of his Father and he was subject to Joseph and Mary  Luke  in conformity to the fifth precept of the law And it should be observed that he did  all this  because  it was easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for  one tittle  of the law to fail  Christ's obedience to the law was not only  universal  but  constant  Nor was this unnecessary for although this law could have had no dominion over him if he had not been made under it to redeem yet after he was made under it he was bound to obey it in all points and to  continue  his obedience unto the end Therefore all that Christ did in obedience to this law is  essential  to his  Righteousness  I think it must be granted that the  Righteousness  of Christ taken in the most proper and complete sense of the word includes the whole of his obedience from his infancy to his death and why should we understand it as intending any thing short of this  when our justification is ascribed directly to it But  We call upon the Objector to produce one single text of scripture wherein the Righteousness of Christ must necessarily be understood as not including the  whole  of his conformity to the moral law or eternal rule of Righteousness  I shall conclude this Essay in the words of DR J OWEN  "I cannot but judge it sounds ill in the ears of all Christians" says he "That the obedience of our Lord Jesus Christ as our Mediator and Surety unto the whole Law of God was for himself and not for us or that what he did therein was not that he might be the end of the Law for Righteousness to every one that believethespecially considering that the saith of the church is That  he was given to us born to us that for us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven and did and suffered what was required of him"  "It is said  That this obedience was necessary as a  QUALIFICATION  of his Person that he might be  MEET  to be a mediator for us and therefore was for himself  But this I positively deny The Lord Christ was every way  meet  for the whole work of Mediation by the  ineffable union  of the  Human Nature  with the  Divine  which exalted it in dignity honour and worth above any thing or all things that ensued thereon For hereby he became in his whole Person the Object of Divine Worship and Honour for  "  When he bringeth the First Begotten into the world he saith And let all the Angels of God worship Him  "  Again That which is  an  effect  of the Person of the Mediator as constituted such cannot be a  Qualification  necessary unto its constitution"  "Whereas therefore he was neither made man nor of the posterity of Abraham for himself but for the Church namely to become thereby the  Surety of the Covenant  and  Representative  of the whole his obedience as Man unto the Law in general and as the Son of Abraham unto the law of Mofes was for his people and not for himself it was so designed so performed and without a respect unto the Church was of no use unto himself  He was born to us  and  given to us lived for us  and  died for us obeyed for us  and  suffered for us  that  by the obedience of one many might be made Righteous  This was the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and this is the Faith of  she Church And what he did  for  us is  imputed to us  This is included in the very notion of his  doing it for us  which cannot be spoken in the true and proper sense unless what he so did be  imputed unto us  And I think men ought to be cautious that they do not by  distinctions  and studied  evasions  for the defence of their own private opinions shake the foundations of the Christian Religion And I am sure it will be easier for them as it is in the proverb to wrest the club out of the hand of Hercules than to disposses the minds of true Believers of this persuasion viz That what the Lord Christ did in obedience unto God according unto the Law he designed in his love and grace to do it for them He needed no obedience for himself he came not into a capacity of yielding obedience for himself  but for us and therefore for us it was that He fulfilled the Law in obedience unto God according unto the terms of it The obligation that was on him unto obedience was originally no less for us no less needful unto us no more for himself no more necessary unto him than the obligation that was on him as the Surety of the Covenant to suffer the penalty of the Law was either the one or the other" Which may be illustrated thus "When the Apostle Paul wrote those words unto Philemon concerning Onesimus ver  If he hath wronged thee  dealt unrighteously or injuriously with thee  or oweth thee ought  wherein thou hast suffered loss by him put it on my account or impute it all unto me I will repay it or answer for it all He supposes that Philemon might have a double action  against Onesimus the one of wrong or injury the other of loss or debt If he hath  wronged thee or oweth thee ought  Hereon he proposeth himself and obligeth himself by his express obligation  I Paul have written it with my own hand  that he would answer for both Hereby he was obliged in his own person to make satisfaction unto Philemon but yet he was to do it for Onesimus and not for himself"  "Some of the ancients disputed That the Son of God should have been incarnate although man had not sinned and fallen but none of them once imagined that he should have been so made man as to be made under the law and be obliged thereby unto that obedience which he hath performed But they judged that immediately he was to have been a Glorious  Head unto the whole Creation For it is a common notion and presumption of all Christians but only such as will sacrifice these notions to their own private conceptions That the obedience which Christ yielded unto the law on the earth in the state and condition wherein he did yield it was not for himself but for the Church which was obliged unto perfect obedience but was not able to accomplish it"  FINIS
