STRAHAN and T CADELL in the Strand  MDCCLXXIII  TO THE KING  SIR  AFTER the great improvements that have been made in Navigation since the discovery of America it may well be thought strange that a very considerable part of the globe on which we live should still have remained unknown that it should still have been the subject of speculation whether a great portion of the Southern Hemisphere is land or water and even where land had been discovered that  neither its extent nor figure should have been ascertained But the cause has probably been that sovereign Princes have seldom any other motive for attempting the discovery of new countries than to conquer them that the advantages of conquering countries which must first be discovered are remote and uncertain and that ambition has always found objects nearer home  It is the distinguishing characteristic of Your Majesty to act from more liberal motives and having the best fleet and the bravest as well as most able navigators in Europe Your Majesty has not with a view to the acquisition of treasure or the extent of dominion but the improvement of commerce and the increase and diffusion of knowlege undertaken what has so long been neglected and under Your Majesty's auspices in little more than seven years discoveries have been made far greater than those of all the navigators in the world  collectively from the expedition of Columbus to the present time  To have been appointed to record them and permitted to inscribe the narrative to Your Majesty is an honour the sense of which will always be retained with the warmest gratitude by  YOUR MAJESTY's Most faithful and most obliged Subject and Servant JOHN HAWKESWORTH  BROMLEY KENT  st May  CONTENTS OF THE FIRST VOLUME  GENERAL INTRODUCTION Page i  An Explanation of the

Astronomical Observations  GENERAL INTRODUCTION  HIS Majesty soon after his accession to the crown formed a design of sending out vessels for making discoveries of countries hitherto unknown and in the year the kingdom being then in a state of profound peace he proceeded to put it into execution The Dolphin and the Tamar were dispatched under the command of Commodore Byron and the best account of his Majesty's motives and design that can be given will be found in the following preamble to Commodore Byron's instructions which are dated the th of June in that year  Whereas nothing can redound more to the honour of this nation as a maritime power to the dignity of the Crown of Great Britain and to the advancement of the trade and navigation thereof than to make discoveries of countries hitherto unknown and whereas there is reason to believe that lands and islands of great extent hitherto unvisited by any European power may be found in the Atlantic Ocean between the Cape of Good Hope and the Magellanic Streight within the latitudes convenient for navigation and in climates adapted to the produce of commodities useful in commerce and whereas his Majesty's islands called Pepys' Island and Falkland's Islands lying within the said tract notwithstanding their having been first discovered and visited by British navigators have never yet been so sufficiently surveyed as that an accurate judgment may be formed of their coasts and product his  Majesty taking the premises into consideration and conceiving no conjuncture so proper for an enterprize of this nature as a time of profound peace which his kingdoms at present happily enjoy has thought fit that it should now be undertaken  The Dolphin was a man of war of the sixth rate mounting twentyfour guns her complement was men with three Lieutenants and thirtyseven petty officers  The Tamar was a sloop mounting sixteen guns her complement was ninety men with three Lieutenants and two and twenty petty officers and the command of her was given to Captain Mouat  Commodore Byron returned in the month of May in the year and in the month of August following the Dolphin was again sent out under the command of Captain Wallis with the Swallow commanded by Captain Carteret in prosecution of the same general design of making discoveries in the southern hemisphere The equipment of the Dolphin was the same as before The Swallow was a sloop mounting fourteen guns her complement was ninety men with one Lieutenant and twentytwo petty officers  These vessels proceeded together till they came within sight of the South Sea at the western entrance of the Streight of Magellan and from thence returned by different routs to England  In the latter part of the year it was resolved by the Royal Society that it would be proper to send persons into some part of the South Sea to observe a transit of the planet Venus over the sun's disk which according to astronomical calculation would happen in the year and that the islands called Marquesas de Mendoza or those of Rotterdam  or Amsterdam were the properest places then known for making such observation  In consequence of these resolutions it was recommended to his Majesty in a memorial from the Society dated February that he would be pleased to order such an observation to be made upon which his Majesty signified to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty his pleasure that a ship should be provided to carry such observers as the Society should think fit to the South Seas and in the beginning of April following the Society received a letter from the Secretary of the Admiralty informing them that a bark of three hundred and seventy tons had been taken up for that purpose This vessel was called the Endeavour and the command of her given to Lieutenant James Cook a gentleman of undoubted abilities in astronomy and navigation who was soon after by the Royal Society appointed with Mr Charles Green a gentleman who had long been assistant to Dr Bradley at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich to observe the transit  While this vessel was getting ready for her expedition Captain Wallis returned and it having been recommended to him by Lord Morton when he went out to fix on a proper place for this astronomical observation he by letter dated on board the Dolphin the th of May the day before he landed at Hastings mentioned Port Royal harbour in an island which he had discovered then called George's Island and since Otaheite the Royal Society therefore by letter dated the beginning of June in answer to an application from the Admiralty to be informed whither they would have their observers sent made choice of that place  The Endeavour had been built for the coal trade and a vessel of that construction was preferred for many reasons particularly because she was what the sailors call a good sea  boat was more roomy would take and lie on the ground better and might be navigated by fewer men than other vessels of the same burden  Her complement of officers and men was Lieutenant Cook the Commander with two Lieutenants under him a Master and boatswain with each two mates a surgeon and carpenter with each one mate a gunner a cook a clerk and steward two quartermasters an armourer a sailmaker three midshipmen fortyone able seamen twelve marines and nine servants in all eightyfour persons besides the Commander she was victualled for eighteen months and took on board ten carriage and twelve swivel guns with good store of ammunition and other necessaries The Endeavour also after the astronomical observation should be made was ordered to prosecute the design of making discoveries in the South Seas What was effected by these vessels in their several voyages will appear in the course of this work of which it is now necessary to give some account  It is drawn up from the journals that were kept by the Commanders of the several ships which were put into my hands by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty for that purpose and with respect to the voyage of the Endeavour from other papers equally authentic an assistance which I have acknowledged in an introduction to the account of her voyage  When I first undertook the work it was debated whether it should be written in the first or third person it was readily acknowledged on all hands that a narrative in the first person would by bringing the Adventurer and the Reader nearer together without the intervention of a stranger more strongly excite an interest and consequently afford more entertainment but it was objected that if it was  written in the name of the several Commanders I could exhibit only a naked narrative without any opinion or sentiment of my own however fair the occasion and without noting the similitude or dissimilitude between the opinions customs or manners of the people now first discovered and those of nations that have been long known or remarking on any other incident or particular that might occur In answer to this objection however it was said that as the manuscript would be submitted to the Gentlemen in whose names it would be written supposing the narrative to be in the first person and nothing published without their approbation it would signify little who conceived the sentiments that should be expressed and therefore I might still be at liberty to express my own In this opinion all parties acquiesced and it was determined that the narrative should be written in the first person and that I might notwithstanding intersperse such sentiments and observations as my subject should suggest they are not indeed numerous and when they occur are always cursory and short for nothing would have been more absurd than to interrupt an interesting narrative or new descriptions by hypothesis and dissertation They will however be found most frequent in the account of the voyage of the Endeavour and the principal reason is that although it stands last in the series great part of it was printed before the others were written so that several remarks which would naturally have been suggested by the incidents and descriptions that would have occurred in the preceding voyages were anticipated by similar incidents and descriptions which occurred in this  Some particulars that are related in one voyage will perhaps appear to be repeated in another as they would necessarily have been if the several Commanders had written the account of their voyages themselves for a digest could not  have been made of the whole without invading the right of each navigator to appropriate the relation of what he had seen these repetitions however taken together will be found to fill but a few pages of the book  That no doubt might remain of the fidelity with which I have related the events recorded in my materials the manuscript account of each voyage was read to the respective Commanders at the Admiralty by the appointment of Lord Sandwich who was himself present during much the greatest part of the time The account of the voyage of the Endeavour was also read to Mr Banks and Dr Solander in whose hands as well as in those of Captain Cook the manuscript was left for a considerable time after the reading Commodore Byron also Captain Wallis and Captain Carteret had the manuscripts of their respective voyages to peruse after they had been read at the Admiralty in their presence and such emendations as they suggested were made In order thus to authenticate the voyage of Captain Cook the account of it was first written because it was expected when his journal was put into my hands that he would have sailed on the voyage he is now making in less than five months  It will probably be thought by many Readers that I have related the nautical events too minutely but it must be remembered that minutely to relate these events was the great object of the work It was in particular thought necessary to insert the situation of the ship at different hours of the day with the bearings of different parts of the land while she was navigating seas and examining shores that hitherto have been altogether unknown in order to ascertain her track more minutely than could be done in any chart however large the scale and to describe with critical  exactness the bays headlands and other irregularities of the coast the appearance of the country its hills vallies mountains and woods with the depth of water and every other particular that might enable future navigators easily to find and safely to visit every part of it I was not indeed myself sufficiently apprised of the minuteness that was necessary in this part of the work so that I was obliged to make many additions to it after I had prepared my manuscript It is however hoped that those who read merely for entertainment will be compensated by the description of countries which no European had before visited and manners which in many instances exhibit a new picture of human life In this part the relation of little circumstances requires no apology for it is from little circumstances that the relation of great events derives its power over the mind An account that ten thousand men perished in a battle that twice the number were swallowed up by an earthquake or that a whole nation was swept away by a pestilence is read in the naked brevity of an index without the least emotion by those who feel themselves strongly interested even for Pamela the imaginary heroine of a novel that is remarkable for the enumeration of particulars in themselves so trifling that we almost wonder how they could occur to the author's mind  This work is illustrated and adorned by a great number of cuts from which every class of readers whether their object is knowlege or pleasure will find equal advantage as they consist not only of maps and charts drawn with great skill and attention but of views and figures designed and executed by the best artists in this country  The most effectual way to prevent obscurity and confusion in relating events is to range them in order of time which  however cannot be done in an unbroken series when the complicated and multifarious objects of history are to be recorded but as each of the narratives in this work is a single thread the transactions of every day are set down in a regular succession and the time noted in the margin  Great care has been taken to make the charts and the nautical part of the narrative coincide if there should be any difference which it is hoped will not be the case the charts are to be confided in as of unquestionable authority By the charts as well as by the narrative especially by that on which the tracks of the several vessels are marked it will be seen how far the existence or non existence of a southern continent is already ascertained and what land has in the course of these voyages been first discovered The charts also will at one view prevent any mistake which might arise from the same name having been given to different islands by the several Commanders in these voyages without the trouble of comparing the latitudes and longitudes assigned them in the narrative  As it is but a very few years since the existence of a race of men above the common stature upon the coast of Patagonia was the subject of eager dispute among all ranks of people in this country I have brought together the whole of the evidence on the question as I find it in a collection of voyages lately printed in France under the title of "Histoire des Navigationes aux Terres Australes"  "It must be acknowledged that the contrariety of the reports that have been made by ocular witnesses concerning a fact easy to be determined does not deviate less from the common course of things than the gigantic stature of the people in question It appears that during an hundred  years almost all navigators of whatever country agree in affirming the existence of a race of giants upon the coast of Patagonia and that during another century the much greater number agree in denying the fact treating their predecessors as idle fabulists and imputing their reports either to the terror which the rude fierceness of a savage people inspired or to the natural propensity of mankind to assume importance by pretending to have seen wonderful things That men have a strange propensity to the marvelous cannot be denied nor that fear naturally magnifies its object but though it be allowed that the accounts of the Patagonians have in some instances been exaggerated it is certain that all who have affirmed their stature to be gigantic were not under the influence of fear and it is very strange that nations who have an hereditary hatred to each other and an acknowledged opposition of interest should agree in asserting an evident falsehood  "In the first place it is well known to have been an opinion long established both in our ancient world and in America that there was once a race of giants upon earth who distinguished themselves by violence and guilt  "Barbenais was told by the inhabitants of South America that a deluge having laid Peru under water the Indians retired to the mountains till the flood should subside and that when they came again down to the plain they found there men of an enormous stature who attacked them with great ferocity killing many and driving the rest to the caves of the rocks but that having continued in their hiding places many years they saw in the air a young man who destroyed the giants by thunderbolts and thus restored to them the possession of their country His guides also showed  him many marks upon a rock which they said were impressed by the thunderbolts and many bones of an extraordinary size which they believed to be remains of the giants but they did not pretend to know when the deluge happened  "The Ynca Garcilasso de la Vega in his history of Peru relates  Pedro de Cieca chap Garcilasso Hist du Perou liv chap  that according to a tradition universally received a number of vessels or junks came to Point Saint Helena with a company of giants on board of a stature so enormous that the natives of the country were not higher than their knees that their eyes were as broad as the bottom of a plate and their limbs proportionably large that some of them were naked and others slightly covered with the skins of beasts That when they came on shore they dug a pit of an astonishing depth in the rock and each of them consuming as much provisions as would be sufficient for fifty men the country was soon exhausted and they were obliged to live upon fish that they seized the women of the country to whom their brutality was fatal and afterwards giving themselves up to worse vices the whole race was destroyed by fire from heaven which however left their bones unconsumed as a lasting memorial of Divine vengeance Bones of an amazing size are said to have been found in this country and fragments of teeth which if they were whole must have weighed half a pound  "Those who wish to know all the particulars of these American traditions may satisfy their curiosity by reading Torquemado lib chap and where they will find that these fables are very similar to those relative to the same subject in other parts of the world The bones said to have been the bones of giants which have been found in America  and which were shewn at Mexico and other places in the year are probably the bones of some animal unknown and indeed nothing less than the sight of such a race of human beings or of an entire skeleton can be admitted as a proof of their existence Turner the naturalist reports that in the year the thigh bone of a man was shewn in London who must have been of an enormous size but this testimony is not decisive though the author adds that he had himself seen near the river Plata upon the coast of Brasil a race of giants who went stark naked that the hinder part of their heads was flat and not round that the women had long black hair as coarse as a horse's mane that the men were excellent archers and besides their bow and arrows carried two massive balls or bullets each fastened to one end of a thong a weapon which they used with great dexterity and force either by striking with it or throwing it like a stone from a sling One of these giants he says was twelve feet high but acknowledges that he saw no other so tall  "Of this fact there are other ocular witnesses who perhaps may be thought more worthy of credit among the Spaniards Magellan Loaisa Sarmiento and Nodal among the English Cavendish Hawkins and Knivet among the Dutch Sebald de Noort le Maire and Spilberg and among the French those who went in the expedition from Marseilles and Saint Maloes Those who bear testimony to the contrary are Winter the Dutch Admiral Hermite Froger in de Gennes's narrative and Sir John Narborough Winter after having himself seen the inhabitants of Patagonia says in direct terms that the accounts of their being giants are falsehoods invented by the Spaniards and it must be confessed that the testimony of these navigators at least counterbalances  the evidence on the other side especially as they were best acquainted with the Streight of Magellan and the neighbouring country Such navigators as have visited this country and are silent with respect to the stature of the inhabitants particularly Sir Francis Drake must be considered as witnesses against the fact in question for their silence is a proof that they saw nothing extraordinary It must however be observed in the first place that the greater part of those who hold the affirmative in this question speak of people that inhabited the desert coast of Patagonia to the east and west and that on the contrary those who hold the negative speak of those who inhabit the Streight upon the sides of the utmost point of America to the north and south The nations of these two districts are certainly not the same and if the first have sometimes been seen in the Streight it cannot be thought strange considering how short the distance is from Port Saint Julian which appears to be their ordinary habitation Magellan and his people saw them there very often and trafficked with them sometimes on board his ships and sometimes on shore nor was this all he seized two of them and kept them prisoners in his vessel one of whom was baptized some time before his death and taught several words of his language to Pigafette who formed them into a little dictionary these are facts than which nothing can be more positive or less subject to illusion  "I affirm says Knivet that when I was at Port Desire I measured several dead bodies that I found buried there which were from fourteen to sixteen spans high and saw tracks in the sand which must have been left by people of nearly the same stature I have also frequently seen at Brazil one of the Patagonians who had been taken at Port Saint  Julian and though he was but a youth he measured no less than thirteen spans and our English prisoners at Brazil have assured me that they had seen many men of the same stature upon the coasts of the streight" Sebald de Wert says that when he was in the Streight he saw giants of the same bulk who tore up trees by the roots that were a span in diameter with great facility he also saw women that were gigantic and others of the common stature Oliver de Noort reports that he saw savages of a gigantic stature at Port Desire but does not call them giants that he took six of them prisoners and carried them on board his ship one of whom afterwards told him that the country was inhabited by many different nations four of which were of the ordinary stature but that farther within the land in a territory called  Coin  there was a gigantic people distinguished by the name of Tiremenen who were continually making war upon the other nations Spilberg relates that he saw a man of an extraordinary stature upon the coast of Terra del Fuego but that the sepulchres which he found had received men of the common height ArisClasz who was on board La Maire's fleet in the character of Commissary a man well worthy of credit declares that having visited the sepulchres which he discovered upon the coast of Patagonia he found the bones of men who were between ten and eleven feet high which convinced him that the reports of former navigators were true and here it must be confessed that the examination was made in cold blood when it cannot be pretended that the object was magnified by fear Some others particularly Nodal and Sir Richard Hawkins content themselves with saying that these savages were a head taller than the inhabitants of Europe and of such a stature that the people on board their vessels called them giants Such is the evidence of past times we shall now consider that of the age  in which we live In the Captains Harrington and Carman who commanded two French vessels one from Saint Maloes and the other from Marseilles saw at one time seven of these giants in Possession Bay at another time six and at a third time they had an interview with a company of more than four hundred men part of whom were gigantic and part of the common stature That Harrington and Carman reported this fact is attested by M Frezier superintendant of the fortifications of Bretagne a man well known and universally esteemed Frezier never saw any of these savages himself but he says that being upon the coast of Chili Don Pedro Molina Governor of the isle of Chiloë and many other eyewitnesses told him that there was at a considerable distance within the country an Indian nation called by their neighbours  Caucohues  who sometimes came down to the Spanish settlements that were more than nine feet high and were the same race with the Patagonians who live on the eastern coast and have been mentioned in former relations We are told by Reaveneau de Lussan that the Spaniards who live upon the sea coast in South America report that certain white Indians inhabit part of Chili with whom they are always at war that they are of an enormous bulk and stature and that whenever they take a Spaniard prisoner they force up the breastbone as they would the shell of a tortoise and tear out his heart Narborough on the contrary though he agrees that the Indians who inhabit the mountains near the Spanish settlements at Chili and perpetually commit hostilities against them are tall expressly denies that their stature is gigantic He had often measured the skulls and the prints of the feet of the savages on the coasts of the Streight of Magellan which he says were of the common size he had also several times seen numerous companies of them even at Port Saint Julian and  these he declares not to be taller or bigger than other men Narborough is certainly a credible witness and his evidence is directly to the point it is confirmed by that of L'Hermite who says that the people he saw upon the coast of Terra del Fuego though they were robust and wellproportioned were not larger than the inhabitants of Europe and lastly M de Gennes bears testimony that none of the people he saw at Port Famine were six feet high  "Those who diligently consider these different relations will find reason to believe that all the parties have spoken truth each of them faithfully reporting what he saw and therefore that the existence of a gigantic race in these parts is a real fact not to be questioned merely because they were not seen by every mariner that visited the country  "It appears to be well established that the inhabitants of the two borders of the Streight are of the common stature and that the race distinguished by the name of Patagonians made their constant residence upon the desart coasts either in some miserable hovels in the depth of the woods or in some caverns of the rocks scarcely accessible to any but themselves and it appears from the account of Oliver de Noort that when the Streight began to be frequented by European vessels they hid themselves as soon as the ships were in sight which accounts both for their not being seen and for the recent marks of inhabitants upon a coast that appeared to be desart Perhaps the frequent appearance of our ships upon this coast at length determined them to quit it as a settled habitation returning only at particular seasons of the year and taking up their constant residence in the interior part of the country Lord Anson was of opinion that they resided statedly on the western side of the Cordeliers  and visited the eastern side occasionally but not often so that if they have been rarely seen by the vessels which have touched at the coast of Patagonia for the last hundred years the reason probably is that being like other Indian nations desirous to conceal themselves from strangers they retired to the mountains It is indeed to be regretted that no skeleton of these people has been brought into Europe and it may at first seem strange that no such evidence of their uncommon stature should have been produced as it is known that several of them who had been made prisoners by the Commanders of European vessels died on board soon after they came into a hot climate but the wonder will cease when it is considered that all mariners have a superstitious opinion that the compass will not traverse if there is a dead body on board the vessel" Upon the whole it may reasonably be presumed that the concurrent testimony of late navigators particularly Commodore Byron Captain Wallis and Captain Carteret Gentlemen of unquestionable veracity who are still living and who not only saw and conversed with these people but measured them will put an end to all the doubts that have been hitherto entertained of their existence  Having thus brought together the whole of the evidence for and against a fact which has long been the object both of popular and philosophical curiosity I shall not anticipate any opinion that the Reader may form concerning future navigations in the track which has been described by any of the vessels whose voyages are here related except that although it is the opinion of Commodore Byron who spent seven weeks and two days in passing through the Streight of Magellan that it may be passed in three weeks at the proper season yet the passage cost Captain Wallis near four  months though he performed it precisely at the time recommended by the Commodore having reached the eastern entrance about the middle of December  I cannot however dismiss my Readers to the following narratives without expressing the regret with which I have recorded the destruction of poor naked savages by our firearms in the course of these expeditions when they endeavoured to repress the invaders of their country a regret which I am confident my Readers will participate with me this however appears to be an evil which if discoveries of new countries are attempted cannot be avoided resistance will always be made and if those who resist are not overpowered the attempt must be relinquished It may perhaps be said that the expence of life upon these occasions is more than is necessary to convince the natives that further contest is hopeless and perhaps this may sometimes have been true but it must be considered that if such expeditions are undertaken the execution of them must be intrusted to persons not exempt from human frailty to men who are liable to provocation by sudden injury to unpremeditated violence by sudden danger to error by the defect of judgment or the strength of passion and always disposed to transfer laws by which they are bound themselves to others who are not subject to their obligation so that every excess thus produced is also an inevitable evil  If it should be said that supposing these mischiefs to be inevitable in attempting discoveries discoveries ought not to be attempted it must be considered that upon the only principles on which this opinion can be supported the risk of life for advantages of the same kind with those proposed in discovering new countries is in every other instance unlawful If it is not lawful to put the life of an Indian in  hazard by an attempt to examine the country in which he lives with a view to increase commerce or knowlege it is not lawful to risk the life of our own people in carrying on commerce with countries already known If it being said that the risk of life in our own people is voluntary and that the Indian is brought into danger without his consent the consequence will still follow for it is universally agreed at least upon the principles of Christianity that men have no more right over their own lives than over the lives of others and suicide being deemed the worst species of murder a man must be proportionably criminal in exposing his own life for any purpose that would not justify his exposing the life of another If the gratification of artificial wants or the inrease of knowlege are justifiable causes for the risk of life the landing by force on a newly discovered country in order to examine its produce may be justified if not every trade and profession that exposes life for advantages of the same kind is unlawful and by what trade or profession is not life exposed Let us examine all the multitudes that art has employed from the refiner who sweats at the furnace to the sedentary artificer who grows pale at the loom and perhaps none can be found in which life is not in some degree sacrificed to the artificial necessities of civil society But will it therefore be said that civil society to which this sacrifice is made is for that reason a combination contrary to the great original principles of morality which are the basis of all duty Will it be said that to exercise the faculties which are the distinguishing characteristics of our nature is unnatural and that being endowed with the various powers which in civil societies only can be brought into action it was incongruous to the will of our Creator that any such society should be formed and that it would be pleasing to him if still continuing in a savage state these powers should  lie torpid in our nature like life in an embrio during the whole of our existence This surely must appear extravagant and absurd in the highest degree especially as it must be allowed that although commerce and arts in some instances expose life in others they preserve it they supply the wants of Nature without rapine and violence and by producing a common interest they prevent the inhabitants of the same country from being divided into different clans which among savages are almost perpetually committing hostilities against each other with a ferocious cruelty which is not to be found where civil government and literary knowlege have meliorated the manners of mankind Upon the whole therefore it seems reasonable to conclude that the increase of knowlege and commerce are ultimately common benefits and that the loss of life which happens in the attempt is among the partial evils which terminate in general good  I have now only to request of such of my Readers as may be disposed to censure me for not having attributed any of the critical escapes from danger that I have recorded to the particular interposition of Providence that they would in this particular allow me the right of private judgment which I claim with the greater confidence as the very same principle which would have determined them to have done it has determined me to the contrary As I firmly believe the divine precept delivered by the Author of Christianity "there is not a sparrow falls to the ground without my Father" and cannot admit the agency of chance in the government of the world I must necessarily refer every event to one cause as well the danger as the escape as well the sufferings as the enjoyments of life and for this opinion I have among other respectable authorities that of the Bible Shall we says Job "receive good from the hand of God and shall we not receive evil" The Supreme Being is equally wise and benevolent  in the dispensation of both evil and good as means of effecting ultimate purposes worthy of his ineffable perfections so that whether we consider ourselves as christians or philosophers we must acknowledge that he deserves blessing not more when he gives than when he takes away If the fall of a sparrow as well as its preservation is imputed to providence why not the fall as well as the preservation of a man and why should we attribute to Providence only what appears to be good in its immediate effect when we suppose that the whole concatenation of events whether the preservation or destruction of particular parts tends ultimately to the good of the whole The same voice commissions the winds to plough up the deep which at the appointed time rebukes them saying "Peace be still" If the adorable Author and Preserver of Nature was such a being as Baal is represented to have been by the prophet when he derided his worshippers if he was sometimes on a journey and sometimes asleep we might with propriety say that a fire  happened  to break out or a storm to rise but that by the interposition of providence life was preserved expressions which imply that the mischief had one origin and the remedy another but such language certainly derogates from the honour of the great Universal Cause who acting through all duration and subsisting in all space fills immensity with his presence and eternity with his power  It will perhaps be said that in particular instances evil necessarily results from that constitution of things which is best upon the whole and that Providence occasionally interferes and supplies the defects of the constitution in these particulars but this notion will appear not to be supported by those facts which are said to be providential it will always be found that Providence interposes too late and only moderates the mischief which it might have prevented But  who can suppose an extraordinary interposition of Providence to supply particular defects in the constitution of nature who sees those defects supplied but in part It is true that when the Endeavour was upon the rock off the coast of New Holland the wind ceased and that otherwise she must have been beaten to pieces but either the subsiding of the wind was a mere natural event or not if it was a natural event providence is out of the question at least we can with no more propriety say that providentially the wind ceased than that providentially the sun rose in the morning If it was not a mere natural event but produced by an extraordinary interposition correcting a defect in the constitution of nature tending to mischief it will lie upon those who maintain the position to shew why an extraordinary interposition did not take place rather to prevent the ship's striking than to prevent her being beaten to pieces after she had struck a very slight impulse upon the ship's course would have caused her to steer clear of the rock and if all things were not equally easy to Omnipotence we should say that this might have been done with less difficulty than a calm could be produced by suspending the general laws of Nature which had brought on the gale  I have however paid my homage to the Supreme Being consonant to my own ideas of his agency and perfections and those who are of opinion that my notions are erroneous must allow that he who does what he thinks to be right and abstains from what he thinks to be wrong acquits himself equally of moral obligation whether his opinions are false or true  AN EXPLANATION

WORLD IN THE YEARS MDCCLXIV MDCCLXV and MDCCLXVI By the Honourable COMMODORE BYRON In his Majesty's Ship the DOLPHIN  CHAP I  The Passage from the Downs to Rio de Janeiro  The longitude in this voyage is reckoned from the meridian of London west to degrees and east afterwards  ON the st of June I sailed from the Downs  with his Majesty's ship the Dolphin and the Tamar frigate which I had received orders to take under my command as I was coming down the river the Dolphin got aground I therefore put into Plymouth where she was docked but did not appear to have received any damage At this place we changed some of our men and having paid the people two months wages in advance I hoisted the broad pendant and sailed again on the d of July  on the th we were off the Lizard  and made the best of our way with a fine breeze but had the mortification to find the Tamar a very heavy sailer In the night of Friday the th  the officer of the first watch saw either a ship on fire or an extraordinary phenomenon which greatly resembled it at some distance it continued to blaze for about half an hour and then disappeared In the evening of Thursday July the th  we saw the rocks near the island of Madeira which our people call the Deserters from  desertes  a name which has been given them from their barren and desolate appearance  the next day we stood in for the road of Funchiale where about three o'clock in the afternoon we came to an anchor In the morning of Saturday the th I waited upon the Governor  who received me with great politeness and saluted me with eleven  guns  which I returned from the ship The next day he returned my visit at the house of the Consul upon which I saluted him with eleven guns which he returned from the fort I found here his Majesty's ship the Crown and the Ferret sloop who also saluted the broad pendant  Having completed our water and procured all the refreshment I was able for the companies of both the ships every man having twenty pounds weight of onions for his sea stock  we weighed anchor on Thursday the th and proceeded on our voyage  On Saturday the st we made the island of Palma one of the Canaries and soon after examining our water we found it would be necessary to touch at one of the Cape de Verd islands for a fresh supply During the whole of our course from the Lizard we observed that no fish followed the ship which I judged to be owing to her being sheathed with copper  By the th our water was become foul and stunk intolerably but we purified it with a machine which had been put on board for that purpose it was a kind of ventilator by which air was forced through the water in a continued stream as long as it was necessary  In the morning of the th  we made the island of Sal one of the Cape de Verds and seeing several turtle upon the water we hoisted out our jolly boat and attempted to strike them but they all went down before our people could come within reach of them  On the morning of the th we were very near the island of Bona Vista  the next day off the Isle of May  and on Monday the th we came to an anchor in Port Praya bay The rainy season was already set in which renders this place very unsafe a large swell that rolls in from the southward makes a frightful surf upon the shore and there is reason every hour to expect a tornado  of which as it is very violent and blows directly in  the consequences are likely to be fatal so that after the th of August no ship comes hither till the rainy season is over which happens in November for this reason I made all possible haste to fill my water and get away I procured three bullocks for the people but they were little better than carrion and the weather was so hot that the flesh stunk in a few hours after they were killed  On Thursday the d of August  we got again under sail with a large cargo of fowls lean goats and monkies which the people contrived to procure for old shirts jackets and other articles of the like kind The intolerable heat and almost incessant rain very soon affected our health and the men began to fall down in fevers notwithstanding all my attention and diligence to make them shift themselves before they slept when they were wet  On Wednesday the th  the Tamar fired a gun upon which we shortened sail till she came up we found that she had suffered no damage but the carrying away of her topsailyard however as we were obliged to make an easy sail till she had got up another and the wind seemed to be coming again to the southward we lost a good deal of way We continued to our great mortification to observe that no fish would come near enough to our copper bottom for us to strike though we saw the sea as it were quickened with them at a little distance Ships in these hot latitudes generally take fish in plenty but except sharks we were not able to catch one  No event worthy of notice happened till Tuesday the th of September  when about three o'clock in the afternoon we saw Cape Frio on the coast of Brazil and about noon on Thursday the th  we anchored in eighteen fathom in  the great Road of Rio de Janeiro  The city which is large and makes a handsome appearance is governed by the Viceroy of Brazil who is perhaps in fact as absolute a sovereign as any upon earth When I visited him he received me in great form above sixty officers were drawn up before the palace as well as a captain's guard who were men of a good appearance and extremely well clothed his Excellency with a number of persons of the first distinction belonging to the place met me at the head of the stairs upon which fifteen guns were fired from the nearest port we then entered the room of state and after conversing about a quarter of an hour in French I took my leave and was dismissed with the same form that had been used at my reception He offered to return my visit at a house which I had hired on shore but this I declined and soon after he returned it on board  The people in my own ship who had as much fresh meat and greens as they could eat every day were very healthy but there being many sick on board the Tamar I procured a place for them on shore where they soon recovered I also engaged a number of Portuguese caulkers as the seams of both the ships were very open who after having worked some time rendered them perfectly tight  While we lay here Lord Clive in the Kent Indiaman came to the port This ship had sailed from England a month before us and had not touched any where yet she came in a month after us so that her passage was just two months longer than ours notwithstanding the time we lost in waiting for the Tamar which though the Dolphin was by no means a good sailer sailed so much worse that we seldom spread more than half our canvas The Kent had many of her people down in the scurvy  On Tuesday the th of October we weighed anchor  being impatient to get to sea for the heat here was intolerable but we lay four or five days above the bar waiting for the land breeze to carry us out for there is no getting out with the sea breeze and the entrance between the two first forts is so narrow and so great a sea breaks in upon them that it was not without much danger and difficulty we got out at last and if we had followed the advice of the Portuguese pilot we had certainly lost the ship As this narrative is published for the advantage of future navigators particularly those of our own nation it is also necessary I should observe that the Portuguese here carrying on a great trade make it their business to attend every time a boat comes on shore and practise every artifice in their power to entice away the crew if other methods do not succeed they make them drunk and immediately send them up the country taking effectual care to prevent their return till the ship to which they belong has left the place by this practice I lost five of my men and the Tamar nine mine I never recovered but the Tamar had the good fortune to learn where her's were detained and by sending out a party in the night surprised them and brought them back  CHAP II  Passage from Rio de Janeiro to Port Desire with some Description of that Place  ON Monday the d  being now once more at sea I called all hands upon deck and informed them that I was not as they imagined bound immediately to the East Indies but upon certain discoveries which it was thought might be of great importance to our country in consideration of which the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty had been pleased to promise them double pay and several other advantages if during the voyage they should behave to my satisfaction They all expressed the greatest joy imaginable upon the occasion and assured me that there was no danger or difficulty that they would not with the utmost cheerfulness undergo in the service of their country nor any order that I could give them which they would not implicitly and zealously obey  We continued our course till Monday the th  having frequently hard gales with sudden gusts which obliged us to strike our topgallantmasts and get up our stumps but this day it blew a storm with a terrible sea and the ship laboured so much that to ease her I ordered the two foremost and two aftermost guns to be thrown overboard the gale continued with nearly equal violence all the rest of the day and all night so that we were obliged to lie to under a doublereefed main sail but in the morning it being more moderate  and veering from N W to S by W we made sail again and stood to the westward We were now in latitude  ° ′ S and found the weather as cold as it is at the same season in England  although the month of November here is a spring month answering to our May and we were near twenty degrees nearer the line to us who within little more than a week had suffered intolerable heat this change was most severely felt and the men who supposing they were to continue in a hot climate during the whole voyage had contrived to sell not only all their warm clothes but their bedding at the different ports where we had touched now applied in great distress for slops and were all furnished for the climate  On Friday the d of November  after administering the proper oath to the Lieutenants of both ships I delivered them their commissions for till this time they acted only under verbal orders from me and expected to receive their commissions in India whither they imagined we were bound We now began to see a great number of birds about the ship many of them very large of which some were brown and white and some black there were among them large flocks of pintadoes which are somewhat larger than a pigeon and spotted with black and white On the th  we saw a great quantity of rock weed and several seals our latitude was ° ′ S longitude ° W the variation ° E the prevailing winds here were westerly so that being continually driven to the eastward we foresaw that it would not be easy to get in with the coast of Patagonia On the th we observed the water to change colour  but we had no ground with one hundred and forty fathom our latitude was now ° ′ S our longitude ° ′ W the variation was ° ′ E The next day we stood in for the land till eight in the evening when we had ground of red sand with fortyfive fathom We steered S W by W all night  and the next morning had fiftytwo fathom with the same ground  our latitude was ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W the variation ° ¾ E  On Monday the th  about four o'clock in the afternoon as I was walking on the quarterdeck all the people upon the forecastle called out at once "Land right ahead" it was then very black almost round the horizon and we had had much thunder and lightning I looked forward under the foresail and upon the lee bow and saw what at first appeared to be an island rising in two rude craggy hills but upon looking to leeward I saw land joining to it and running a long way to the south east we were then steering S W and I sent officers to the masthead to look out upon the weather beam and they called out that they saw land also a great way to the windward I immediately brought to and sounded we had still fiftytwo fathom but I thought that we were embayed and rather wished than hoped that we should get clear before night We made sail and steered E S E the land still having the same appearance and the hills looking blue as they generally do at a little distance in dark rainy weather and now many of the people said that they saw the sea break upon the sandy beaches but having steered out for about an hour what we had taken for land vanished all at once and to our great astonishment appeared to have been a fogbank Though I had been almost continually at sea for seven and twenty years I had never seen such a deception before others however have been equally deceived for the master of a ship not long since made oath that he had seen an island between the west end of Ireland and Newfoundland and even distinguished the trees that grew upon it Yet it is certain that no such island exists at least it could never be found though several ships were afterwards sent  out on purpose to seek it And I am sure  that if the weather had not cleared up soon enough for us to see what we had taken for land disappear every man on board would freely have made oath that land had been discovered in this situation Our latitude this day was ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W and the variation ° ′ E  The next day at four o'clock in the afternoon  the weather being extremely fine the wind shifted at once to the S W and began to blow fresh the sky at the same time becoming black to windward in a few minutes all the people that were upon the deck were alarmed with a sudden and unusual noise like the breaking of the sea upon the shore I ordered the topsails to be handed immediately but before it could be done I saw the sea approaching at some distance in vast billows covered with foam I called to the people to hawl up the foresail and let go the main sheet instantly for I was persuaded that if we had any sail out when the gust reached us we should either be overset or lose all our masts It reached us however before we could raise the main tack and laid us upon our beam ends the main tack was then cut for it was become impossible to cast it off and the main sheet struck down the First Lieutenant bruised him dreadfully and beat out three of his teeth the main topsail which was not quite handed was split to pieces If this squall which came on with less warning and more violence than any I had ever seen had taken us in the night I think the ship must have been lost When it came on we observed several hundred of birds flying before it which expressed their terror by loud shrieks it lasted about twenty minutes and then gradually subsided The Tamar split her main sail but as she was to leeward of us she had more time to prepare In a short time it began to blow very hard  again  so that we reefed our main sail and lay to under it all night As morning approached the gale became more moderate but we had still a great sea and the wind shifting to S by W we stood to the westward under our courses Soon after it was light the sea appeared as red as blood being covered with a small shellfish of that colour somewhat resembling our crayfish but less of which we took up great quantities in baskets  At half an hour past four in the morning of Thursday the th of November  we saw land which had the appearance of an island about eight or nine leagues long there being no land in sight either to the northward or southward though by the charts it should be Cape Saint Helena which projects from the coast to a considerable distance and forms two bays one to the north and the other to the south As the weather was very fine I tacked and stood in for it about ten o'clock but as there were many sunken rocks at about two leagues distance from it upon which the sea broke very high and the wind seemed to be gradually dying away I tacked again and stood off The land appeared to be barren and rocky without either tree or bush when I was nearest to it I sounded and had fortyfive fathom with black muddy ground To my great misfortune my three Lieutenants and the Master were at this time so ill as to be incapable of duty though the rest of the ship's company were in good health Our latitude was ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W the variation ° ′ E  The next day I shaped my course by the chart in the account of Lord Anson's voyage  for Cape Blanco In the evening it blew extremely hard at S W by S so that we brought to for the night under our main sail  In the morning we made sail again but we had a great sea and although it  was now almost midsummer in these parts the weather was  in every respect much worse than it is in the Bay of Biscay at the depth of winter About six in the evening having carried all the sail I could we made land bearing about S S W which as we had a good observation of the sun we knew to be Cape Blanco but it now began to blow with more violence than ever and the storm continued all night with a sea that was continually breaking over us so that the ship laboured very much At four in the morning  we sounded and had forty fathom with rocky ground having stood off in the night we now wore and stood in again the storm still continuing with hail and snow and about six o'clock we saw the land again bearing S W by W The ship was now so light that in a gale of wind she drove bodily to leeward so that I was very solicitous to get into Port Desire that I might put her hold in order and take in sufficient ballast to avoid the danger of being caught upon a lee shore in her present trim We steered in for the land with the wind at N E and in the evening brought to but the wind coming to the westward we were driven off in the night At seven the next morning we stood in again  steering S W by S by the compass and soon perceived the sea to break right ahead of us we immediately sounded and shoaled our water from thirteen to seven fathom soon after deepening it again from seventeen to fortytwo so that we went over the end of a shoal which a little farther to the northward might have been fatal to us Cape Blanco at this time bore W S W ½ S distant four leagues but we were still at a loss for Port Desire it being impossible that any description should be more confused than that which Sir John Narborough has given of this harbour I stood into a bay to the southward of the Cape as he directs but could find no such place I therefore stood along the shore to the southward  the wind blowing off the land very hard  and saw several large columns of smoke rising in many places but no tree or bush the country resembling in appearance the barren downs of England We observed also that the water was frequently very shallow at the distance of seven or eight miles from the shore for we had many times not more than ten fathom  We continued to stand along the shore all day as near as possible and in the evening we saw an island at the distance of about six leagues  in the morning we stood in for it and found that it corresponded with Narborough's description of Penguin island As Port Desire is said to lie about three leagues north west of this island I sent the boat to look for it and when she returned having found it I stood in for the land There were thousands of seals and penguins about the ship and near Penguin Island several smaller islands or rather rocks In the evening we saw a remarkable rock rising from the water like a steeple on the south side of the entrance of Port Desire this rock is an excellent mark to know the harbour which it would otherwise be difficult to find At night there being little wind we anchored at the distance of four or five miles from the shore and in the morning  with a breeze from the land we turned up the harbour's mouth we found it very narrow with many rocks and shoals about it and the most rapid tide I had ever known I came to an anchor off the harbour in nine fathom the entrance of the river being open and bearing W S W Penguin Island S E ½ E distant about three leagues the Steeple rock S W by W the northermost land N N W and two rocks which are covered at half tide and lie at the southermost extremity of a reef which runs from the same land N E by N I mention all these bearings particularly because I think it may be of importance to future navigators  especially as the descriptions that have been given of this place by the few who have already visited it  are extremely defective The wind blew very hard the greater part of this day and there ran an ugly sea where we were stationed yet I ordered out two boats to sound the harbour and attended in my own boat myself We found it very narrow for near two miles with a tide running at the rate of eight miles an hour we found also many rocks and shoals but all the danger shows itself above water When we came to the shore I landed and walked a little way into the country which as far as I could see was all downs without a single tree or shrub We saw the dung of many beasts and had a glimpse of four which ran away as soon as we came in sight so that we could not certainly determine what they were but we believed them to be Guanicoes many of which we afterwards saw come down to the water side they resemble our deer but are much larger the height of some being not less than thirteen hands they are very shy and very swift After I returned to my boat I went farther up the harbour and landed upon an island that was covered with seals of which we killed above fifty and among them many that were larger than a bullock having before half loaded our boat with different kinds of birds of which and seals there are enough to supply the navy of England Among the birds one was very remarkable the head resembled that of an eagle except that it had a large comb upon it round the neck there was a white ruff exactly resembling a lady's tippet the feathers on the back were as black as jet and as bright as the finest polish could render that mineral the legs were remarkably strong and large the talons were like those of an eagle except that they were not so sharp and the wings when they were extended measured from point to point no less than twelve feet  The Tamar worked into the harbour with the tide of flood  but I kept my station with the Dolphin till I should have a leading wind and the wind shifting to the eastward I weighed about five o'clock in the afternoon intending to go up with the evening flood before I could get under sail however the wind shifted again to N W by N and it being low water the ship lying but just within the harbour and there being no tide to assist us we were obliged to anchor near the south shore The wind came off the land in very hard flaws and in a short time our anchor coming home the ship tailed on shore against a steep gravelly beach The anchoring ground indeed as far as we had yet sounded was bad being very hard so that in this situation if the wind blows fresh there is always the greatest reason to fear that the anchor should come home before the ship can be brought up While we were on shore it began to blow very hard and the tide running like a sluice it was with the utmost difficulty that we could carry an anchor out to heave us off however after about four hours hard labour this was effected and the ship floated in the stream As there was only about six or seven feet of the after part of her that touched the ground there was reason to hope that she had suffered no damage however I determined to unhang the rudder that it might be examined  During all this night and the next morning the wind blew with great violence  we had let go out best bower anchor when we were near the shore in hopes it would have brought us up and had not yet been able to weigh it We now rode in a very disagreeable situation with our small bower and that unfortunately came home again we therefore got a hawser out of the Tamar who lay in the stream and after weighing the small bower we got out by her assistance  and then dropped it again  most ardently wishing for fair weather that we might get the ship properly moored  The next day we sounded the harbour higher up  and found the ground softer and the water not so deep yet the wind continued to blow so hard that we could not venture to change our station We had found a small spring of water about half a mile inland upon the north side of the bay but it had a brackish taste I had also made another excursion of several miles into the country which I found barren and desolate in every direction as far as the eye could reach We had seen many guanicoes at a distance but we could not get near enough to have a shot at them we tracked beasts of several kinds in the soil near a pond of salt water and among them a very large tyger we found also a nest of ostriches eggs which we eat and thought very good It is probable that all the animals which had left marks of their feet near the salt pond drank the water and indeed we saw no fresh water for them The spring that we had found which was not perfectly fresh was the only one of the kind that we had been able to discover and for that we had been obliged to dig there being no appearance of it except a slight moisture of the ground  On the th upon slack water  we carried both the ships higher up and moored them the extreme points of the harbour's mouth at low water bore from E by S ¼ S to E and the Steeple rock S E ¼ E We had here at low water but six fathom but at spring tides the water rises no less than four fathom and an half which is seven and twenty feet The tide indeed in this place is such as perhaps it is not in any other It happened by some accident that one of our men fell overboard the boats were all alongside and the man was an exceeding good swimmer yet before any assistance  could be sent after him  the rapidity of the stream had hurried him almost out of fight we had however at last the good fortune to save him This day I was again on shore and walked six or seven miles up the country I saw several hares as large as a fawn I shot one of them which weighed more than six and twenty pounds and if I had had a good greyhound I dare say the ship's company might have lived upon hare two days in the week In the mean time the people on board were busy in getting up all the cables upon deck and clearing the hold that a proper quantity of ballast might be taken in and the guns lowered into it except a few which it might be thought necessary to keep above  On the th  I went a good way up the harbour in the boat and having landed on the north side we soon after found an old oar of a very singular make and the barrel of a musquet with the King's broad arrow upon it The musquet barrel had suffered so much from the weather that it might be crumbled into dust between the fingers I imagined it had been left there by the Wager's people or perhaps by Sir John Narborough Hitherto we had found no kind of vegetables except a species of wild peas but though we had seen no inhabitants we saw places where they had made their fires which however did not appear to be recent While we were on shore we shot some wild ducks and a hare the hare ran two miles after he was wounded though it appeared when he was taken up that a ball had passed quite through his body I went this day many miles up the country and had a long chace after one of the guanicoes which was the largest we had seen he frequently stopped to look at us when he had left us at a good distance behind and made a noise that resembled the neighing of a horse but when we came pretty near him he set out again and at  last  my dog being so tired that he could not run him any longer he got quite away from us and we saw him no more We shot a hare however and a little ugly animal which stunk so intolerably that none of us could go near him The flesh of the hares here is as white as snow and nothing can be better tasted A Serjeant of marines and some others who were on shore at another part of the bay had better success than fell to our share for they killed two old guanicoes and a fawn they were however obliged to leave them where they fell not being able to bring them down to the water side near six miles without farther assistance though they were but half the weight of those that are mentioned by Sir John Narborough some however I saw which could not weigh less than seven or eight and thirty stone which is about three hundred pounds When we returned in the evening it blew very hard and the deck being so full of lumber that we could not hoist the boats in we moored them astern About midnight the storm continuing our six oared cutter filled with water and broke adrift the boatkeeper by whose neglect this accident happened being on board her very narrowly escaped drowning by catching hold of the stern ladder As it was tide of flood when she went from the ship we knew that she must drive up the harbour yet as the loss of her would be an irremediable misfortune I suffered much anxiety till I could send after her in the morning  and it was then some hours before she was brought back having driven many miles with the stream In the mean time I sent another party to fetch the guanicoes which our people had shot the night before but they found nothing left except the bones the tygers having eaten the flesh and even cracked the bones of the limbs to come at the marrow Several of our people had been fifteen miles up the country in search of fresh water  but could not find the least rill  we had sunk several wells to a considerable depth where the ground appeared moist but upon visiting them I had the mortification to find that all together they would not yield more than thirty gallons in twentyfour hours this was a discouraging circumstance especially as our people among other expedients had watched the guanicoes and seen them drink at the salt ponds  therefore determined to leave the place as soon as the ship could be got into a little order and the six oared cutter repaired which had been hauled up upon the beach for that purpose  On the th  some of our people who had been ashore on the north side of the bay to try for more guanicoes found the scull and bones of a man which they brought off with them and one young guanicoe alive which we all agreed was one of the most beautiful creatures we had ever seen it soon grew very tame and would suck our fingers like a calf but notwithstanding all our care and contrivances to feed it it died in a few days In the afternoon of this day it blew so hard that I was obliged to keep a considerable number of hands continually by the sheet anchor as there was too much reason to fear that our cables would part which however did not happen In the mean time some of our people that were on shore with the carpenters who were repairing the cutter on the south side of the bay found two more springs of tolerable water about two miles from the beach  in a direct line from the ship's station To these springs I sent twenty hands early in the morning with some small casks called Barecas and in a few turns they brought on board a tun of water of which we began to be in great want In the mean time I went myself about twelve miles up the river in my boat and the weather then growing bad  I went on shore the river as far as I could see  was very broad there were in it a number of islands some of which were very large and I make no doubt but that it penetrates the country for some hundreds of miles It was upon one of the islands that I went on shore and I found there such a number of birds that when they rose they literally darkened the sky and we could not walk a step without treading upon their eggs As they kept hovering over our heads at a little distance the men knocked down many of them with stones and sticks and carried off several hundreds of their eggs After some time I left the island and landed upon the main where our men dressed and eat their eggs though there were young birds in most of them I saw no traces of inhabitants on either side of the river but great numbers of guanicoes in herds of sixty or seventy together they would not however suffer us to approach them but stood and gazed at us from the hills In this excursion the Surgeon who was of my party shot a tygercat a small but very fierce animal for though it was much wounded it maintained a very sharp contest with my dog for a considerable time before it was killed  On the th we completed our ballast  which the strength of the tide and the constant gales of wind rendered a very difficult and laborious task we also got on board another ton of water On the morning of the th  the weather was so bad that we could not send a boat on shore but employed all hands on board in setting up the rigging It grew more moderate however about noon and I then sent a boat to procure more water The two men who first came up to the well found there a large tyger lying upon the ground having gazed at each other some time the men who had no firearms seeing the beast treat them with as  much contemptuous neglect as the lion did the knight of La Mancha  began to throw stones at him of this insult however he did not deign to take the least notice but continued stretched upon the ground in great tranquillity till the rest of the party came up and then he very leisurely rose and walked away  On the st of December  our cutter being thoroughly repaired we took her on board but the weather was so bad that we could not get off any water the next day we struck the tents which had been set up at the wateringplace and got all ready for sea The two wells from which we got our water bear about S S E of the Steeple rock from which they are distant about two miles and an half but I fixed a mark near them that they might be still more easily found than by their bearings During our stay in this harbour we sounded every part of it with great care as high as a ship could go and found that there is no danger but what may be seen at low water so that now fresh water is found though at some distance from the beach it would be a very convenient place for ships to touch at if it were not for the rapidity of the tide The country about the bay abounds with guanicoes and a great variety of wild fowl particularly ducks geese widgeon and seapies besides many others for which we have no name Here is also such plenty of excellent muscles that a boat may be loaded with them every time it is low water Wood indeed is scarce however in some parts of this coast there are bushes which in a case of necessity might produce a tolerable supply of fuel  On Wednesday the th of December  I unmoored in order to get out but the best bower came up foul and before we could heave short upon the small bower the tide of ebb made strong for at this place slack water scarcely continues  ten minutes  so that we were obliged to wait till it should be low water Between five and six in the evening we weighed and steered out E N E with a fresh gale at N N W  CHAP III  Course from Port Desire in Search of Pepys' Island and afterwards to the Coast of Patagonia with a Description of the Inhabitants  AS soon as we were out of the bay we steered for Pepys' Island which is said to lie in latitude ° S Our latitude was now ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W Port Desire bore S W distant twentythree leagues and Pepys' Island according to Halley's Chart E ¾ N distant thirtyfour leagues The variation here was ° E  We continued our course the next day with a pleasant gale and fine weather  so that we began to think that this part of the world was not wholly without a summer On the th  I found myself much farther to the northward than expected and therefore supposed the ship's way had been influenced by a current I had now made eighty degrees easting which is the distance from the main at which Pepys' Island is placed in Halley's chart but unhappily we have no certain account of the place The only person who pretends to have seen it is Cowley the account of whose voyage is now before me and all he says of its situation is that it lies in latitude S for he says nothing of its longitude he says indeed that it has a fine harbour but he adds that  the wind blew so hard he could not get into it  and that he therefore stood away to the southward At this time I also was steering southward for the weather being extremely fine I could see very far to the northward of the situation in which it is laid down As I supposed it must lie to the eastward of us if indeed it had any existence I made the Tamar's signal to spread early in the afternoon and as the weather continued to be very clear we could see between us at least twenty leagues We steered S E by the compass and at night brought to being by my account in latitude ° ′ S  The next morning it blew very hard at N W by N and I still thought the island might lie to the eastward I therefore intended to stand about thirty leagues that way and if I found no island to return into the latitude of again But a hard gale coming on with a great sea I brought to about six o'clock in the evening under the mainsail  and at six o'clock the next morning the wind being at W S W we made sail again under our courses to the northward I now judged myself to be about sixteen leagues to the eastward of the track I had run before Port Desire bore S ° ′ W distant ninetyfour leagues and in this situation I saw a great quantity of rockweed and many birds We continued to stand to the northward the next day under our courses  with a hard gale from S W to N W and a great sea At night being in latitude ° ′ S I wore ship and stood in to the westward again our ships having spread every day as far as they could be seen by each other and on the th at noon  being now certain that there could be no such island as is mentioned by Cowley and laid down by Halley under the name of Pepys' Island I resolved to stand in for the main and take in wood and water of which both ships were in great want at the first convenient place I could  find especially as the season was advancing very fast  and we had no time to lose From this time we continued to haul in for the land as the winds would permit and kept a lookout for the islands of Sebald de Wert which by all the charts we had on board could not be far from our track a great number of birds were every day about the ship and large whales were continually swimming by her The weather in general was fine but very cold and we all agreed notwithstanding the hope we had once formed that the only difference between the middle of summer here and the middle of winter in England lies in the length of the days On Saturday the th  being in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W we were overtaken about six in the evening by the hardest gale at S W that I was ever in with a sea still higher than any I had seen in going round Cape Horn with Lord Anson I expected every moment that it would fill us our ship being much too deep waisted for such a voyage it would have been safest to put before it under our bare poles but our stock of fresh water was not sufficient and I was afraid of being driven so far off the land as not to be able to recover it before the whole was exhausted we therefore lay to under a balanced mizen and shipped many heavy seas though we found our skreen bulkheads of infinite service  The storm continued with unabated violence the whole night but about eight in the morning began to subside  At ten we made sail under our courses and continued to steer for the land till Tuesday the th  when at four in the morning we saw it from the masthead Our latitude was now ° ′ S our longitude ° ′ W and Cape Virgin Mary the north entrance of the streight of Magellan bore S ° ′ W distant nineteen leagues As we had little or no wind we could not get in with the land tills day the  next morning  however it being northerly I stood in to a deep bay at the bottom of which there appeared to be a harbour but I found it barred the sea breaking quite from one side of it to the other and at low water I could perceive that it was rocky and almost all dry the water was shoal at a good distance from it and I was in six fathom before I stood out again In this place there seemed to be plenty of fish and we saw many porpoises swimming after them that were as white as snow with black spots a very uncommon and beautiful sight The land here has the same appearance as about Port Desire all downs without a single tree  At break of day on the th  we were off Cape Fairweather which bore about west at the distance of four leagues and we had here but thirteen fathom water so that it appears necessary to give that Cape a good birth From this place I ran close in shore to Cape Virgin Mary but I found the coast to lie S S E very different from Sir John Narborough's description and a long spit of sand running to the southward of the Cape for above a league in the evening I worked up close to this spit of sand having seen many guanicoes feeding in the vallies as we went along and a great smoke all the afternoon about four or five leagues up the streight upon the north shore At this place I came to an anchor in fifteen fathom water but the Tamar was so far to leeward that she could not fetch the anchoring ground and therefore kept under way all night  The next morning  at daybreak I got again under sail and seeing the same smoke that I had observed the day before I stood in for it and anchored about two miles from the shore This is the place where the crew of the Wager as they were passing the Streight in their boat after the loss of the vessel saw a number of horsemen who waved what appeared  N  o    to be white handkerchiefs  inviting them to come on shore which they were very desirous to have done but it blew so hard that they were obliged to stand out to sea Bulkeley the Gunner of the Wager who has published some account of her voyage says that they were in doubt whether these people were Europeans who had been shipwrecked upon the coast or native inhabitants of the country about the river Gallagoes Just as we came to an anchor I saw with my glass exactly what was seen by the people in the Wager a number of horsemen riding backward and forward directly abreast of the ship and waving somewhat white as an invitation to us to come on shore As I was very desirous to know what these people were I ordered out my twelve oar'd boat and went towards the beach with Mr Marshall my Second Lieutenant and a party of men very well armed Mr Gumming my First Lieutenant following in the six oar'd cutter When we came within a little distance of the shore we saw as near as I can guess about five hundred people some on foot but the greater part on horseback they drew up upon a stoney spit which ran a good way into the sea and upon which it was very bad landing for the water was shallow and the stones very large The people on shore kept waving and hallooing which as we understood were invitations to land I could not perceive that they had any weapons among them however I made signs that they should retire to a little distance with which they immediately complied they continued to shout with great vociferation and in a short time we landed though not without great difficulty most of the boat's crew being up to the middle in water I drew up my people upon the beach with my officers at their head and gave orders that none of them should move from that station till I should either call or beckon to them I then went forward  alone  towards the Indians but perceiving that they retired as I advanced I made signs that one of them should come near as it happened my signals were understood and one of them who afterwards appeared to be a Chief came towards me he was of a gigantic stature and seemed to realize the tales of monsters in a human shape he had the skin of some wild beast thrown over his shoulders as a Scotch Highlander wears his plaid and was painted so as to make the most hideous appearance I ever beheld round one eye was a large circle of white a circle of black surrounded the other and the rest of his face was streaked with paint of different colours I did not measure him but if I may judge of his height by the proportion of his stature to my own it could not be much less than seven feet When this frightful Colossus came up we muttered somewhat to each other as a salutation and I then walked with him towards his companions to whom as I advanced I made signs that they should sit down and they all readily complied there were among them many women who seemed to be proportionably large and few of the men were less than the Chief who had come forward to meet me I had heard their voices very loud at a distance and when I came near I perceived a good number of very old men who were chanting some unintelligible words in the most doleful cadence I ever heard with an air of serious solemnity which inclined me to think that it was a religious ceremony they were all painted and clothed nearly in the same manner the circles round the two eyes were in no instance of one colour but they were not universally black and white some being white and red and some red and black their teeth were as white as ivory remarkably even and well set but except the skins which they wore with the hair inwards most of them were naked a few only having upon their legs a kind of  boot with a short pointed stick fastened to each heel  which served as a spur Having looked round upon these enormous goblins with no small astonishment and with some difficulty made those that were still galloping up sit down with the rest I took out a quantity of yellow and white beads which I distributed among them and which they received with very strong expressions of pleasure I then took out a whole piece of green silk riband and giving the end of it into the hands of one of them I made the person that sat next take hold of it and so on as far as it would reach all this while they sat very quietly nor did any of those that held the riband attempt to pull it from the rest though I perceived that they were still more delighted with it than with the beads While the riband was thus extended I took out a pair of scissars and cut it between each two of the Indians that held it so that I left about a yard in the possession of every one which I afterwards tied about their heads where they suffered it to remain without so much as touching it while I was with them Their peaceable and orderly behaviour on this occasion certainly did them honour especially as my presents could not extend to the whole company neither impatience to share the new finery nor curiosity to gain a nearer view of me and what I was doing brought any one of them from the station that I had allotted him It would be very natural for those who have read Gay's fables if they form an idea of an Indian almost naked returning to his fellows in the woods adorned with European trinkets to think of the monkey that had seen the world yet before we despise their fondness for glass beads ribands and other things which among up are held in no estimation we should consider that in themselves the ornaments of savage and civil life are equal and that those who live nearly in a state of nature have nothing that resembles glass so much  as glass resembles a diamond  the value which we set upon a diamond therefore is more capricious than the value which they set upon glass The love of ornament seems to be a universal principle in human nature and the splendid transparency of glass and the regular figure of a bead are among the qualities that by the constitution of our nature excite pleasing ideas and although in one of these qualities the diamond excels glass its value is much more than in proportion to the difference the pleasure which it gives among us is principally by conferring distinction and gratifying vanity which is independant of natural taste that is gratified by certain hues and figures to which for that reason we give the name of beauty it must be remembered also that an Indian is more distinguished by a glass button or a bead than any individual among us by a diamond though perhaps the same sacrifice is not made to his vanity as the possession of his finery is rather a testimony of his good fortune than of his influence or power in consequence of his having what as the common medium of all earthly possessions is supposed to confer virtual superiority and intrinsic advantage The people however whom I had now adorned were not wholly strangers to European commodities for upon a closer attention I perceived among them one woman who had bracelets either of brass or very pale gold upon her arms and some beads of blue glass strung upon two long queues of hair which being parted at the top hung down over each shoulder before her she was of a most enormous size and her face was if possible more frightfully painted than the rest I had a great desire to learn where she got her beads and bracelets and enquired by all the signs I could devise but found it impossible to make myself understood One of the men shewed me the bowl of a tobacco pipe which was made of a red earth but  I soon found that they had no tobacco among them  and this person made me understand that he wanted some upon this I beckoned to my people who remained upon the beach drawn up as I had left them and three or four of them ran forward imagining that I wanted them The Indians who as I had observed kept their eyes almost continually upon them no sooner saw some of them advance than they all rose up with a great clamour and were leaving the place as I supposed to get their arms which were probably left at a little distance to prevent mischief therefore and put an end to the alarm which had thus accidentally been spread among them I ran to meet the people who were in consequence of my signal coming from the beach and as soon as I was within hearing I hallooed to them and told them that I would have only one come up with all the tobacco that he could collect from the rest As soon as the Indians saw this they recovered from their surprize and every one returned to his station except a very old man who came up to me and sung a long song which I much regretted my not being able to understand before the song was well finished Mr Cumming came up with the tobacco and I could not but smile at the astonishment which I saw expressed in his countenance upon perceiving himself though six feet two inches high become at once a pigmy among giants for these people may indeed more properly be called giants than tall men of the few among us who are full six feet high scarcely any are broad and muscular in proportion to their stature but look rather like men of the common bulk run up accidentally to an unusual height and a man who should measure only six feet two inches and equally exceed a stout wellset man of the common stature in breadth and muscle would strike us rather as being of a gigantic race than as an individual accidentally  anomalous  our sensations therefore upon seeing five hundred people the shortest of whom were at least four inches taller and bulky in proportion may be easily imagined After I had presented the tobacco four or five of the chief men came up to me and as I understood by the signs they made wanted me to mount one of the horses and go with them to their habitations but as it would upon every account have been imprudent to comply I made signs in return that I must go back to the ship at this they expressed great concern and sat down in their stations again During our pantomimical conference an old man often laid his head down upon the stones and shutting his eyes for about half a minute afterwards pointed first to his mouth and then to the hills meaning as I imagined that if I would stay with them till the morning they would furnish me with some provisions but this offer I was obliged to decline When I left them not one of them offered to follow us but as long as I could see them continued to sit quietly in their places I observed that they had with them a great number of dogs with which I suppose they chase the wild animals which serve them for food The horses were not large nor in good case yet they appeared to be nimble and well broken The bridle was a leathern thong with a small piece of wood that served for a bit and the saddles resembled the pads that are in use among the country people in England The women rode astride and both men and women without stirrups yet they gallopped fearlessly over the spit upon which we landed the stones of which were large loose and slippery  CHAP IV  Passage up the Streight of Magellan to Port Famine with some Account of that Harbour and the adjacent Coast  SOON after I returned on board I got under way  and worked up the Streight which is here about nine leagues broad with the flood not with a view to pass through it but in search of some place where I might get a supply of wood and water not chusing to trust wholly to the finding of Falkland's Islands which I determined afterwards to seek About eight in the evening the tide of ebb beginning to make I anchored in five and twenty fathom Point Possession bore N N E at about three miles distance and some remarkable hummocks on the north which Bulkeley from their appearance has called the Asses Ears W ½ N  At three in the morning of the d  we weighed with the wind at E and steered S W by W about twelve miles During this course we went over a bank of which no notice has hitherto been taken at one time we had but six fathom and a half but in two or three casts we had thirteen When our water was shallowest the Asses Ears bore N W by W ½ W distant three leagues and the north point of the first Narrow W by S distant between five and six miles We then steered S W by S near six miles to the entrance of the first Narrow and afterwards S S W about six miles which brought us through the tide here was so strong that the passage was very rapid During this course we saw a single  Indian upon the south shore  who kept waving to us as long as we were in sight we saw also some guanicoes upon the hills though Wood in the account of his voyage says there were none upon that shore As soon as we had passed the first Narrow we entered a little sea for we did not come in sight of the entrance of the second Narrow till we had run two leagues The distance from the first to the second Narrow is about eight leagues and the course S W by W The land is very high on the north side of the second Narrow which continues for about five leagues and we steered through it S W ½ W with soundings from twenty to five and twenty fathom we went out of the west end of this Narrow about noon and steered south about three leagues for Elizabeth's island but the wind then coming right against us we anchored in seven fathom The island bore S S E distant about a mile and Bartholomew's Island bore E S E In the evening six Indians upon the Island came down to the water side and continued waving and hallooing to us for a long time but as my people wanted rest I was unwilling to employ them in hoisting out a boat and the Indians seeing their labour fruitless at length went away While we were steering from Point Possession to the first Narrow the flood set to the southward but as soon as we entered the Narrow it set strongly over to the north shore it flows here at the full and change of the moon about ten o'clock Between the first and the second Narrow the flood sets to the S W and the ebb to the N E after the west end of the second Narrow is past the course with a leading wind is S by E three leagues Between the islands of Elizabeth and Saint Bartholomew the channel is about half a mile over and the water is deep we found the flood set very strongly to the southward with a great rippling but round the Islands the tides set many different ways  In the morning of the d  we weighed with the wind at S by W and worked between Elizabeth and Bartholomew's island before the tide was spent we got over upon the north shore and anchored in ten fathom Saint George's Island then bore N E by N distant three leagues a point of land which I called PORPOIS POINT N by W distant about five miles and the southermost land S by E distant about two miles In the evening we weighed and steered S by E about five miles along the north shore at about one mile's distance with regular soundings from seven to thirteen fathom and every where good ground At ten o'clock at night we anchored in thirteen fathom Sandy Point then bearing S by E distant four miles Porpois Point W N W three leagues and Saint George's Island N E four leagues All along this shore the flood sets to the southward at the full and change of the moon it flows about eleven o'clock and the water rises about fifteen feet  The next morning  I went out in my boat in search of Fresh Water Bay I landed with my Second Lieutenant upon Sandy Point and having sent the boat along the shore we walked abreast of her Upon the Point we found plenty of wood and very good water and for four or five miles the shore was exceedingly pleasant Over the Point there is a fine level country with a soil that to all appearance is extremely rich for the ground was covered with flowers of various kinds that perfumed the air with their fragrance and among them there were berries almost innumerable where the blossoms had been shed we observed that the grass was very good and that it was intermixed with a great number of peas in blossom Among this luxuriance of herbage we saw many hundreds of birds feeding which from their form and the uncommon beauty of their plumage we called  painted geese  We walked more than twelve miles and found great plenty of fine fresh water but not the bay that we sought for we saw no part of the shore in all our walk from Sandy Point where a boat could land without the utmost hazard the water being every where shoal and the sea breaking very high We fell in with a great number of the huts or wigwams of the Indians which appeared to have been very lately deserted for in some of them the fires which they had kindled were scarcely extinguished they were in little recesses of the woods and always close to fresh water In many places we found plenty of wild celery and a variety of plants which probably would be of great benefit to seamen after a long voyage In the evening we walked back again and found the ships at anchor in Sandy Point Bay at the distance of about half a mile from the shore The keen air of this place made our people so voraciously hungry that they could have eaten three times their allowance I was therefore very glad to find some of them employed in hauling the seine and others on shore with their guns sixty very large mullets were just taken with the seine as I came up and the gunners had good sport for the place abounded with geese teale snipes and other birds that were excellent food  On the th  Christmas day we observed by two altitudes and found the latitude of Sandy Point to be ° ′ S At eight in the morning we weighed and having sailed five leagues from Sandy Point in the direction of S by E ½ E we anchored again in thirtytwo fathom about a mile from the shore the south point of Fresh Water Bay then bearing N N W distant about four miles and the southermost land S E by S As we sailed along the shore at about two miles distance we had no ground with sixty fathom but at the distance of one mile we had from twenty to thirtytwo fathom  At the full and change of the moon  the tide flows off Fresh Water Bay at twelve o'clock it runs but little yet flows very much by the shore  On the th at eight o'clock in the morning we weighed  with the wind at E N E and steered S S E for Port Famine At noon St Anne's Point which is the northermost point of that port bore S by E ½ E distant three leagues Along this shore at the distance of two or three miles we had very deep water but within a mile had ground with twentyfive or thirty fathom From St Anne's Point a reef of rocks runs out S E by E about two miles and at the distance of two cables length from this reef the water will suddenly shoal from sixtyfive to thirtyfive and twenty fathom The Point itself is very steep so that there is no sounding till it is approached very near and great care must be taken in standing into Port Famine especially if the ship is as far southward as Sedger river for the water will shoal at once from thirty to twenty fifteen and twelve fathom and at about two cables length farther in at more than a mile from the shore there is but nine feet water when the tide is out By hauling close round St Anne's Point soundings will soon be got and as the water shoals very fast it is not safe to go farther in when there is no more than seven fathom the streight here is not more than four leagues wide  The next day at noon having had little wind and calms  we anchored in Port Famine close to the shore and found our situation very safe and convenient we had shelter from all winds except the S E which seldom blows and if a ship should be driven ashore in the bottom of the bay she could receive no damage for it is all fine soft ground We found drift wood here sufficient to have furnished a thousand sail  so that we had no need to take the trouble of cutting green  The water of Sedger river is excellent but the boats cannot get in till about two hours flood because at low water it is very shallow for about three quarters of a mile I went up it about four miles in my boat and the fallen trees then rendered it impossible to go farther I found it indeed not only difficult but dangerous to get up thus far The stream is very rapid and many stumps of trees lie hidden under it one of these made its way through the bottom of my boat and in an instant she was full of water We got on shore as well as we could and afterwards with great difficulty hauled her up upon the side of the river here we contrived to stop the hole in her bottom so as that we made a shift to get her down to the river's mouth where she was soon properly repaired by the carpenter On each side of this river there are the finest trees I ever saw and I make no doubt but that they would supply the British navy with the best masts in the world Some of them are of a great height and more than eight feet in diameter which is proportionably more than eight yards in circumference so that four men joining hand in hand could not compass them among others we found the pepper tree or winter's bark in great plenty Among these woods notwithstanding the coldness of the climate there are innumerable parrots and other birds of the most beautiful plumage I shot every day geese and ducks enough to serve my own table and several others and every body on board might have done the same we had indeed great plenty of fresh provisions of all kinds for we caught as much fish every day as served the companies of both ships As I was much on shore here I tracked many wild beasts in the sand but never saw one we also found many huts or wigwams but never met with an Indian The country between this Port and Cape Forward  which is distant about four leagues is extremely fine  the soil appears to be very good and there are no less than three pretty large rivers besides several brooks  While we lay here I went one day to Cape Forward and when I set out I intended to have gone farther but the weather became so bad with heavy rain that we were glad to stop there and make a great fire to dry our clothes which were wet through From the place where we stopped the Indians had been gone so lately that the wood which lay half burnt where they had made their fire was still warm and soon after our fire was kindled we perceived that another was kindled directly opposite to it on the Terra del Fuego shore probably as a signal which if we had been Indians we should have understood After we were dried and refreshed at our fire the rain having abated I walked cross the Cape to see how the Streight ran which I found to be about W N W The hills as far as I could see were of an immense height very craggy and covered with snow quite from the summit to the base I made also another excursion along the shore to the northward and found the country for many miles exceedingly pleasant the ground being in many places covered with flowers which were not inferior to those that are commonly found in our gardens either in beauty or fragrance and if it were not for the severity of the cold in winter this country might in my opinion be made by cultivation one of the finest in the world I had set up a small tent at the bottom of this bay close to a little rivulet and just at the skirts of a wood soon after the ship came to an anchor where three men were employed in washing they slept on shore but soon after sunset were awakened out of their first sleep by the roaring of some wild beasts which the darkness of the night and the solitariness of their situation in this pathless  detail  rendered horrid beyond imagination the tone was hollow and deep so that the beasts of whatever kind were certainly large and the poor fellows perceived that they drew nearer and nearer as the sound every minute became more loud From this time sleep was renounced for the night a large fire was immediately kindled and a constant blaze kept up this prevented the beasts from invading the tent but they continued to prowl round it at a little distance with incessant howlings till the day broke and then to the great comfort of the affrighted sailors they disappeared  At this place not far from where the ship lay there is a hill that has been cleared of wood and we supposed this to be the spot where the Spaniards formerly had a settlement  See some account of this settlement in the Voyage of Captain Wallis chap iii p  One of the men as he was passing over this hill perceived that in a particular part the ground returned the sound of his foot as if it was hollow he therefore repassed it several times and finding the effect still the same he conceived a strong notion that something was buried there when he came on board he related what he had remarked to me and I went myself to the spot with a small party furnished with spades and pickaxes and saw the spot opened to a considerable depth but we found nothing nor did there appear to be any hollow or vault as was expected As we were returning through the woods we found two very large skulls which by the teeth appeared to have belonged to some beasts of prey but of what kind we could not guess  Having continued here till Friday the th of January  and completed the wood and water of both ships for which purpose I had entered the Streight I determined to steer back again in search of Falkland's Islands  A Chart of HAWKINS's MAIDENLAND  Discovered by S  r  Richard Hawkins in  and FALKLAND SOUND  so called by Cap  n  John Strong  of the Farewell from London  who Sailed through it  in  map  CHAP V  The Course back from Port Famine to Falkland's Islands with some Account of the Country  WE weighed anchor at four o'clock in the morning  and worked to windward out of the harbour the wind continued contrary at N N E till about one o'clock the next day  when it shifted to W S W and blew a fresh gale We steered N W by N four leagues and then three leagues north between Elizabeth and Bartholomew islands we then steered from the islands N by E three leagues to the second Narrow and steered through N E ½ E continuing the same course from the second Narrow to the first which was a run of eight leagues As the wind still continued to blow fresh we steered through the first Narrow against the flood in the direction of N N E but about ten o'clock at night the wind dying away the flood set us back again into the entrance of the first Narrow where we were obliged to anchor in forty fathom within two cables length of the shore The tide flows here at the full and change of the moon about two o'clock and runs full six knots an hour  At one o'clock the next morning we weighed  with a light northerly breeze and about three we passed the first Narrow a second time Having now seen the ship safe through and being quite exhausted with fatigue as I had been upon the deck all the preceding day and all night I went into my cabbin to get some rest I lay down and soon fell asleep  but in less than half an hour  I was awakened by the beating of the ship upon a bank I instantly started up and ran upon the deck where I soon found that we had grounded upon a hard sand It was happy for us that at this time it was stark calm and I immediately ordered out the boats to carry an anchor astern where the water was deepest the anchor took the ground but before we could work the capstern in order to heave the ship off to it she went off by the mere rising of the tide It happened fortunately to be just low water when she went aground and there was fifteen feet forward and six fathom a very little way astern The Master told me that at the last cast of the lead before we were aground he had thirteen fathom so that the water shoaled at once no less than sixtythree feet  This bank which has not been mentioned by any navigator who has passed the Streight is extremely dangerous especially as it lies directly in the fair way between Cape Virgin Mary and the first Narrow and just in the middle between the south and north shores It is more than two leagues long and full as broad in many places also it is very steep When we were upon it Point Possession bore N E distant three leagues and the entrance of the narrow S W distant two leagues I afterwards saw many parts of it dry and the sea breaking very high over other parts of it where the water was shallow A ship that should ground upon this shoal in a gale of wind would probably be very soon beaten to pieces  About six o'clock in the morning we anchored in fifteen fathom the shoal bearing N N W ½ W at the distance of about half a mile At noon we weighed with a light breeze at N E and worked with the ebb tide till two but finding the water shoal we anchored again in six fathom and an  half  at about the distance of half a mile from the south side of the shoal The Asses Ears then bearing N W by W distant four leagues and the south point of the entrance of the first Narrow W S W distant about three leagues At this time the opening of the Narrow was shut in and upon sending out the boats to sound they discovered a channel between the shoal and the south shore of the Streight The Tamar in the mean time as she was endeavouring to come near us was very near going on shore having once got into three fathom but soon after came to an anchor in the channel between the shoal and the north shore  The next morning about eight o'clock we weighed  with little wind at W S W and steered about half a mile S E by E when having deepened our water to thirteen fathom we steered between the E and E N E along the south side of the shoal at the distance of about seven miles from the south shore keeping two boats at some distance one on each bow to sound The depth of water was very irregular varying continually between nine and fifteen fathom and upon hauling nearer to the shoal we had very soon no more than seven fathom the boats went over a bank upon which they had six fathom and an half it being then low water but within the bank they had thirteen fathom At noon we were to the eastward of the shoal and as we hauled over to the north shore we soon deepened our water to twenty fathom Point Possession at this time bore N N W distant between four and five leagues the Asses Ears W N W distant six leagues and Cape Virgin Mary N E ½ E distant about seven leagues From this situation we steered N E by E for the south end of the spit which runs to the southward of the Cape and had no soundings with five and twenty fathom At four in the afternoon Cape Virgin Mary bore N E and the south end of the spit N E by E distant three leagues At  eight the next morning  the Cape bore N by W distant two leagues Our latitude was ° ′ and our soundings were eleven and twelve fathom We now brought to for the Tamar who had come through the north channel and was some leagues astern of us and while we were waiting for her coming up the officer of the watch informed me that the head of the mainmast was sprung I immediately went up to look at it myself and found it split almost in a strait line perpendicularly for a considerable length but I could not discover exactly how far the fissure went for the cheeks that were upon the mast We imagined this to have happened in the very hard gale that had overtaken us some time before but as it was of more importance to contrive how to repair the damage than discover how it happened we immediately put on a strong fish and woolded it so well that we had reason to hope the mast would be as serviceable as ever Cape Virgin Mary now bore S W distant twentyone leagues and our latitude was ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W the variation ° E  On the th  having sailed S E our latitude was ° ′ S our longitude ° ′ W and Cape Virgin Mary bore S W distant thirtythree leagues  On the th  there having been little wind for the last twentyfour hours between the north and east with thick foggy weather our course was N W for thirtynine miles Our latitude was ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W variation ° E and Cape Virgin Mary bore S W distant thirtythree leagues  On the th  we had strong gales at S W with a great sea our course was N E for ninetynine miles Our latitude was ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W Cape Virgin Mary bore S ° ′ W distant sixtyfive leagues and Cape Fairweather  W S distant seventy leagues the variation was now ° E  About seven in the evening I thought I saw land ahead of us but the Tamar being some leagues astern I wore ship and made an easy sail off the next morning  at break of day I stood in again the wind having shifted in the night to N W and about four o'clock I recovered sight of the land ahead which had the appearance of three islands I imagined they might be the islands of Sebald de Wert but intending to stand between them I found that the land which had appeared to be separated was joined by some very low ground which formed a deep bay As soon as I had made this discovery I tacked and stood out again and at the same time saw land a great way to the southward which I made no doubt was the same that is mentioned in the charts by the name of the New Islands As I was hauling out of this bay I saw a long low shoal of rocks stretching out for more than a league to the northward of us and another of the same kind lying between that and what we had taken for the northermost of De Wert's islands This land except the low part which is not seen till it is approached near consists of high craggy barren rocks which in appearance very much resemble Staten Land When I had got to near as to discover the low land I was quite embayed and if it had blown hard at S W so great a sea must have rolled in here as would have rendered it almost impossible to claw off the shore all ships therefore that may hereafter navigate these parts should avoid falling in with it The seals and birds here are innumerable we saw also many whales spouting about us several of which were of an enormous size Our latitude now was ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W the variation was ° ′ E In the evening we brought to and at daybreak the next morning  stood in for the north part of the island by the coast of which  we had been embayed  when we had got about four miles to the eastward it fell calm and rained with great violence during which there arose such a swell as I never remember to have seen it came from the westward and ran so quick and so high that I expected every moment it would break it set us very fast towards the shore which is as dangerous as any in the world and I could see the surge breaking at some distance from it mountains high happily for us a fresh gale sprung up at south east with which to our great joy we were able to stand off and it behoves whoever shall afterwards come this way to give the north part of this island a good birth After I had got to some distance the weather being thick and it raining very hard I brought to Our latitude was now ° S and longitude ° ′ W  On Monday the th  the weather having cleared up and the wind shifted to the S S W we steered along the shore S E by E four miles and saw a low flat island full of high tufts of grass resembling bushes bearing south at the distance of two or three leagues the northermost land at the same time bearing west distant about six leagues we had here thirtyeight fathom with rocky ground We continued our course along the shore six leagues farther and then saw a low rocky island bearing S E by E distant about five miles here we brought to and having sounded we had forty fathom water with a bottom of white sand This island is about three leagues distant from the land we were coasting which here forms a very deep bay and bears E by N of the other island on which we had seen the long tufts of grass we saw the sea break at a good distance from the shore and during the night stood off and on The next morning at three o'clock we made sail and stood in for the land to look for a harbour  At six the east end of the rocky island bore W S W distant about three miles and our soundings  then were sixteen fathom with rocky ground  but when we got within the island we had twenty fathom with fine white sand The coast from this rocky island lies E by S distant about seven or eight leagues where there are two low islands which make the eastermost land in sight At eight o'clock we saw an opening which had the appearance of an harbour bearing E S E and being between two and three leagues distant Upon this discovery we brought to and sent a boat from each of the ships to examine the opening but it beginning to blow very hard soon after and the weather growing thick with heavy rain we were obliged to stand out to sea with both the ships and it was not without great difficulty that we cleared the two rocky islands which were to the eastward of us We had now a great sea and I began to be under much concern lest we should be blown off and our people in the boats left behind however about three in the afternoon the weather clearing up I tacked and stood in again and presently after had the satisfaction to see one of the boats though it was a long way to leeward of us I immediately bore down to her and found her to be the Tamar's boat with Mr Hindman the Second Lieutenant on board who having been on shore in the opening had ventured off notwithstanding the great sea and bad weather to inform me that he had found a fine harbour we immediately stood in for it and found it equally beyond his report and our expectations the entrance is about a mile over and every part of it is perfectly safe the depth of water close to the shore being from ten to seven fathom We found this harbour to consist of two little bays on the starboard side where ships may anchor in great safety and in each of which there is a fine rivulet of fresh water Soon after we entered an harbour of much greater extent which I called PORT EGMONT  in honour of the earl  who was then First Lord of the Admiralty and I think it is one of the finest harbours in the world The mouth of it is S E distant seven leagues from the low rocky island which is a good mark to know it by within the island and at the distance of about two miles from the shore there is between seventeen and eighteen fathom water and about three leagues to the westward of the harbour there is a remarkable white sandy beach off which a ship may anchor till there is an opportunity to run in In standing in for this sandy beach the two low rocky islands which we found it difficult to clear when the weather obliged us to stand off appear to the eastward and Port Egmont is about sixteen leagues from the north end of these islands We moored in ten fathom with fine holding ground The northermost point of the western shore was distant two miles and an half the wateringplace on that shore bore W N W ½ W and was distant half a mile and the islands on the east side bore E by S and were distant four miles The whole navy of England might ride here in perfect security from all winds Soon after the ship came to an anchor the other boat which had remained on shore when Mr Hindman put off came on board In the southermost part of the harbour there are several islands but there is no passage out for a ship I went however through in my boat about seven leagues distant from where the ship lay and entered a large sound which is too much exposed to a westerly wind for ships to lie in it safely and the Master of the Tamar who had been round in her boat and entered this sound from without reported that many shoals lay off it so that if the harbour was ever so good it would not be prudent to attempt getting in In every part of Port Egmont there is fresh water in the greatest plenty and geese ducks snipes and other birds are so numerous that  our people grew tired of them it was a common thing for a boat to bring off sixty or seventy fine geese without expending a single charge of powder and shot for the men knocked down as many as they pleased with stones wood however is wanting here except a little that is found adrift along the shore which I imagined came from the Streight of Magellan Among other refreshments which are in the highest degree salutary to those who have contracted scorbutic disorders during a long voyage here are wild celery and wood sorrel in the greatest abundance nor is there any want of mussels clams cockles and limpets the seals and penguins are innumerable so that it is impossible to walk upon the beach without first driving them away and the coast abounds with sea lions many of which are of an enormous size We found this animal very formidable I was once attacked by one of them very unexpectedly and it was with the utmost difficulty that I could disengage myself from him at other times we had many battles with them and it has sometimes afforded a dozen of us an hour's work to dispatch one of them I had with me a very fine mastiff dog and a bite of one of these creatures almost tore him to pieces Nor were these the only dangerous animals that we found here for the Master having been sent out one day to sound the coast upon the south shore reported at his return that four creatures of great fierceness resembling wolves ran up to their bellies in the water to attack the people in his boat and that as they happened to have no firearms with them they had immediately put the boat off into deep water The next morning after this happened I went upon the southern shore myself where we found one of the largest sea lions I had ever seen as the boat's crew were now well armed they immediately engaged him and during the contest one of the other animals was seen running towards us he was  fired at before he came up and was presently killed though I afterwards wished that we had endeavoured to take him alive which if we had been aware of his attack I dare say might easily have been done When any of these creatures got fight of our people though at ever so great a distance they ran directly at them and no less than five of them were killed this day They were always called wolves by the ship's company but except in their size and the shape of the tail I think they bore a greater resemblance to a fox They are as big as a middlesized mastiff and their fangs are remarkably long and sharp There are great numbers of them upon this coast though it is not perhaps easy to guess how they first came hither for these islands are at least one hundred leagues distant from the main they burrow in the ground like a fox and we have frequently seen pieces of seal which they have mangled and the skins of penguins lie scattered about the mouth of their holes To get rid of these creatures our people set fire to the grass so that the country was in a blaze as far as the eye could reach for several days and we could see them running in great numbers to seek other quarters I dug holes in many places about two feet deep to examine the soil which I found first a black mould and then a light clay While we lay here we set up the armourer's forge on shore and completed a great deal of iron work that was much wanted Our people had every morning an excellent breakfast made of portable soup and wild celery thickened with oatmeal neither was our attention confined wholly to ourselves for the Surgeon of the Tamar surrounded a piece of ground near the wateringplace with a fence of turf and planted it with many esculent vegetables as a garden for the benefit of those who might hereafter come to this place Of this harbour and all the neighbouring islands I took possession for his Majesty  King George the Third of Great Britain by the name of FALKLAND's ISLANDS and there is I think little reason to doubt that they are the same land to which Cowley gave the name of Pepys's Island  In the printed account of Cowley's voyage he says  we held our course S W till we came into the latitude of  fortyseven  degrees where we saw land the same being an island not before known lying to the  westward  of us it was not inhabited and I gave it the name of PEPYS's ISLAND We found it a very commodious place for ships to water at and take  in wood  and it has  a very good harbour where a thousand sail of ships may safely ride  Here is  great plenty of fowls  and we judge abundance of fish by reason of the grounds being nothing but rocks and sands  To this account there is annexed a representation of Pepys's Island in which names are given to several points and head lands and the harbour is called Admiralty Bay yet it appears that Cowley had only a distant view of it for he immediately adds  the wind being so extraordinary high that we could not get into it to water we stood to the southward shaping our course  S S W  till we came into the latitude of  and though he says that  it was commodious to take in wood  and it is known that there is no wood on Falkland's Islands Pepys's Island and Falkland's Islands may notwithstanding be the same for upon Falkland's Islands there are immense quantities of flags with narrow leaves reeds and rushes which grow in clusters so as to form bushes about three feet high and then shoot about six or seven feet higher these at a distance have greatly the appearance of wood and were taken for wood by the French who landed there in the year  as appears by Pernetty's account of their voyage It has been suggested that the latitude of Pepys's Island might in the M S from which the account of Cowley's voyage was printed be expressed in figures which if ill made might equally resemble fortyseven and fiftyone and therefore as there is no island in these seas in latitude fortyseven and as Falkland's Islands lie nearly in fiftyone that fiftyone might reasonably be concluded to be the number for which the figures were intended to stand recourse therefore was had to the British Musaeum and a manuscript journal of Cowley's was there found In this manuscript no mention is made of an island not before known to which he gave the name of Pepys's Island but land is mentioned in latitude fortyseven degrees forty minutes expressed in words at length which exactly answers to the description of what is called Pepys's Island in the printed account and which here he says he supposed to be the islands of Sebald de Wert This part of the manuscript is in the following words  January This month wee were in the latitude of  fortyseaven degrees  and forty minnetts where wee espyed an island bearing  west  from us wee having the wind at east north east wee bore away for it it being too late for us to goe on shoare wee lay by all night The island seemed very pleasant to the eye  with many woods  I may as well say the whole land was woods There being a rock lying above water to the eastward of it where an  innumerable company of fowles  being of the bignesse of a small goose which fowles would strike at our men as they were aloft some of them wee killed and eat they seemed to us very good only tasted somewhat fishly I sailed along that island to the southward and about the south west side of the island there seemed to me to be a good place for shipps to ride I  would have had the boat out to have gone into the harbour but the wind blew fresh and they would not agree to go with it Sailing a litle further keeping the lead and having six and twenty and seaven and twenty fathoms water untill wee came to a place where wee saw the weeds ride having the lead againe found but seaven fathoms water Fearing danger went about the shipp there were then fearefull to stay by the land any longer it being all rocky ground but  the harbour seemed to be a good place for shipps  to ride there in the island seeming likewise to have water enough there seemed to me to be harbour  for five hundred saile of shipps  The going in but narrow and the north side of the entrance shallow water that I could see but I verily believe that there is water enough for any shipp to goe in on the south side for there cannot be so great a lack of water but must needs scowre a channell away at the ebbe deepe enough for shipping to goe in I would have had them stood upon a wind all night but they told me they were not come out to goe upon discovery Wee saw likewise another island by this that night which made me thinke them to be the Sibble D'wards  The same night wee steered our course againe  west south west  which was but our south west the compasse having two and twenty degrees variation eastwardly keeping that course till wee came in the latitude of  three and fifty  degrees  In both the printed and manuscript account this land is said to lie in latitude fortyseven to be situated to the westward of the ship when first discovered to appear woody to have an harbour where a great number of ships might ride in safety and to be frequented by innumerable birds It  appears also by both accounts that the weather prevented his going on shore and that he steered from it W S W till he came into latitude fiftythree there can therefore be little doubt but that Cowley gave the name of Pepys's Island after he came home to what he really supposed to be the island of Sebald de Wert for which it is not difficult to assign several reasons and though the supposition of a mistake of the figures does not appear to be well grounded yet there being no land in fortyseven the evidence that what Cowley saw was Falkland's Islands is very strong The description of the country agrees in almost every particular and even the map is of the same general figure with a streight running up the middle The chart of Falkland's that accompanies this narrative was laid down from the journals and drawings of Captain Macbride who was dispatched thither after my return and circumnavigated the whole coast the two principal islands were probably called Falkland's Islands by Strong about the year as he is known to have given the name of Falkland's Sound to part of the streight which divides them The journal of this navigator is still unprinted in the British Musaeum The first who saw these islands is supposed to be Captain Davies the associate of Cavendish in In Sir Richard Hawking saw land supposed to be the same and in honour of his mistress Queen Elizabeth called them HAWKINS's MAIDEN LAND Long afterwards they were seen by some French ships from Saint Maloes and Frezier probably for that reason called them the Malouins a name which has been since adopted by the Spaniards  Having continued in the harbour which I had called Port Egmont till Sunday the th of January  we sailed again at eight o'clock in the morning with the wind at S S W but  we were scarcely got out of the Port before it began to blow very hard  and the weather became so thick that we could not see the rocky islands I now most heartily wished myself again at anchor in the harbour we had quitted but in a short time we had the satisfaction to see the weather become clear though it continued to blow very hard the whole day At nine the entrance of Port Egmont harbour bore E S E distant two leagues the two low islands to the northward E by N distant between three and four miles and the Rocky island W ½ N distant four leagues At ten the two low islands bore S S E distant four or five miles and we then steered along the shore east by the compass and after having run about five leagues we saw a remarkable headland with a rock at a little distance from it bearing E S E ½ E distant three leagues This headland I called CAPE TAMAR Having continued the same course five leagues farther we saw a rock about five miles from the main bearing N E at the distance of four or five leagues this rock I called the EDISTONE and then steered between it and a remarkable headland which I called CAPE DOLPHIN in the direction of E N E five leagues farther From Cape Tamar to Cape Dolphin a distance of about eight leagues the land forms what I thought a deep sound and called CARLISLE SOUND but what has since appeared to be the northern entrance of the Streight between the two principal islands In the part that I supposed to be the bottom of the sound we saw an opening which had the appearance of a harbour From Cape Dolphin we steered along the shore E ½ N sixteen leagues to a low flat cape or headland and then brought to In this day's run the land for the most part resembled the east side of the coast of Patagonia not having so much as a single tree or even a bush being all downs with here and there a few of the high tufts of grass that we had seen  at Port Egmont  and in this account I am sure I am not mistaken for I frequently sailed within two miles of the shore so that if there had been a shrub as big as a gooseberry bush I should have seen it During the night we had forty fathom water with rocky ground  The next morning  at four o'clock we made sail the low flat cape then bearing S E by E distant five leagues at half an hour after five it bore S S E distant two leagues and we then steered from it E S E five leagues to three low rocky islands which lie about two miles from the main From these islands we steered S S E four leagues to two other low islands which lie at the distance of about one mile from the main Between these islands the land forms a very deep sound which I called BERKELEY's SOUND In the south part of this sound there is an opening which has the appearance of a harbour and about three or four miles to the southward of the south point of it at the distance of about four miles from the main some rocks appear above the water upon which the sea breaks very high there being here a great swell from the southward When we were abreast of these breakers we steered S W by S about two leagues when the southermost land in sight which I took to be the southermost part of Falkland's Islands bore W S W distant five leagues The coast now began to be very dangerous there being in all directions rocks and breakers at a great distance from the shore The country also inland had a more rude and desolate appearance the high ground as far as we could see being all barren craggy rocks very much resembling that part of Terra del Fuego which lies near Cape Horn As the sea now rose every moment I was afraid of being caught here upon a lee shore in which case there would have been very little chance of my getting off  and therefore I tacked and stood to the northward  the latitude of the southermost point in sight being about ° ′ S As we had now run no less than seventy leagues along the coast of this island it must certainly be of very considerable extent It has been said by some former navigators to be about two hundred miles in circumference but I made no doubt of its being nearer seven Having hauled the wind I stood to the northward about noon the entrance of Berkeley's Sound at three o'clock bore S W by W distant about six leagues At eight in evening the wind shifting to the S W we stood to the westward  CHAP VI  The Passage through the Streight of Magellan as far as Cape Monday with a Description of several Bays and Harbours formed by the Coast on each Side  WE continued to make sail for Port Desire till Wednesday the th of February  when about one o'clock in the afternoon we saw land and stood in for the Port During the run from Falkland's Islands to this place the number of whales about the ship was so great as to render the navigation dangerous we were very near striking upon one and another blew the water in upon the quarter deck they were much larger than any we had seen As we were standing in for Port Desire we saw the Florida a storeship that we expected from England and at four we came to an anchor off the harbour's mouth  The next morning  Mr Dean the Master of the storeship came on board and finding from his report that his foremast was sprung and his ship little better than a wreck I determined to go into the harbour and try to unload her there although the narrowness of the place and the rapidity of the tides render it a very dangerous situation We got in in the evening but it blowing very hard in the night both the Tamar and the storeship made signals of distress I immediately sent my boats to their assistance who found that notwithstanding they were moored they had been driven up the harbour and were in the greatest danger of  being on shore They were got off  not without great difficulty and the very next night they drove again and were again saved by the same efforts from the same danger As I now found that the storeship was continually driving about the harbour and every moment in danger of being lost I gave up with whatever reluctance my design of taking the provisions out of her and sent all our carpenters on board to fish the mast and make such other repairs as they could I also lent her my forge to complete such iron work as they wanted and determined the moment she was in a condition to put to sea to take her with us into the Streight of Magellan and unload her there While this was doing Captain Mouat who commanded the Tamar informed me that his rudder was sprung and that he had reason to fear it would in a short time become wholly unserviceable Upon this I ordered the carpenter of the Dolphin on board the Tamar to examine the rudder and he reported it to be so bad that in his opinion the vessel could not proceed in her voyage without a new one A new one however it was not in our power to procure at this place and I therefore desired Captain Mouat to get his forge on shore and secure his rudder with iron clamps in the best manner he could hoping that in the Streight a piece of timber might be found which would furnish him with a better  On Wednesday the th the storeship being ready for sea  I put on board her one of my petty officers who was well acquainted with the Streight and three or four of my seamen to assist in navigating her I also lent her two of my boats and took those belonging to her which were staved on board to get them repaired and then I ordered her Master to put to sea directly and make the best of his way to Port Famine though I did not doubt but that I  should come up with her long before she got thither  as I intended to follow her as soon as the Tamar was ready and Captain Mouat had told me that the rudder having been patched together by the joint labour and skill of the carpenter and smith he should be in a condition to proceed with me the next morning  The next morning we accordingly put to sea  and a few hours afterwards being abreast of Penguin Island we saw the storeship a long way to the eastward  On Saturday the th  about six o'clock in the morning we saw Cape Fairweather bearing W S W at the distance of five or six leagues and at nine we saw a strange sail to the N W standing after us  On the th  at six in the morning Cape Virgin Mary bearing south distant five miles we hauled in for the Streight and the strange ship still followed us  On the th we passed the first Narrow  and as I perceived the strange ship to have shaped the same course that we had from the time she had first seen us shortening or making sail as we did she became the subject of much speculation and as I was obliged after I had got through the first Narrow to bring to for the storeship which was a great way astern I imagined she would speak with us and therefore I put the ship in the best order I could As soon as he had passed the Narrow and saw me lying to he did the same about four miles to windward of me In this situation we remained till night came on and the tide setting us over to the south shore we came to an anchor the wind however shifted before morning and at daybreak I saw our satellite at anchor about three leagues to leeward of us As it was then tide of stood I thought of working through the second Narrow  but seeing the stranger get under way  and work up towards us I ran directly over into Gregory Bay and brought the ship to an anchor with a spring upon our cable I also got eight of our guns which were all we could get at out of the hold and brought them over on one side In the mean time the ship continued to work up towards us and various were our conjectures about her for she showed no colours neither did we It happened about this time that the storeship as she was endeavouring to come to an anchor near us ran aground upon which the stranger came to an anchor a little way astern at the same time hoisting French colours and sending his launch and another boat with an anchor to assist her Still however I showed no colours but sent my own boats and a boat of the Tamar's to assist the storeship giving orders at the same time to the officers not to suffer the French boats to come on board her but to thank them in polite terms for the assistance they intended These orders were punctually obeyed and with the assistance of our own boats only the storeship was soon after got off my people reported that the French ship was full of men and seemed to have a great number of officers on board  At six o'clock in the evening I made the signal and weighed we worked through the second Narrow and at ten o'clock passed the west end of it at eleven we anchored in seven fathom off Elizabeth's Island and the French ship at the same time anchored in a bad situation to the southward of Saint Bartholomew's Island which convinced me that she was not acquainted with the channel  At six o'clock the next morning  I weighed and sailed between Elizabeth and Bartholomew Islands with the wind at N W and after steering S S W five or six miles we crossed a bank where among the weeds we had seven fathom  water  This bank lies W S W five or six miles from the middle of George's Island and it is said in some former accounts that in many places there is not three fathom water upon it the danger here therefore is considerable and to avoid it it is necessary to keep near Elizabeth's Island till the western shore is but at a short distance and then a southern course may be steered with great safety till the reef which lies about four miles to the northward of Saint Anne's Point is in sight At noon this day the north point of Fresh Water Bay bore W by N and Saint Anne's Point S by E ½ E The French ship still steered after us and we imagined that she was either from Falkland's Islands where the French had then a settlement to get wood or upon a survey of the Streight The remaining part of this day and the next morning  we had variable winds with calms in the afternoon therefore I hoisted out the boats and towed round Saint Anne's Point into Port Famine at six in the evening we anchored and soon after the French ship passed by us to the southward  Here we continued till Monday the th  when both the Dolphin and Tamar having taken out of the storeship as much provision as they could stow I gave the Master of her orders to return to England as soon as he could get ready and with the Tamar sailed from Port Famine intending to push through the Streight before the season should be too far advanced At noon we were three leagues distant from Saint Anne's Point which bore N W and three or four miles distant from Point Shutup which bore S S W Point Shutup bears from Saint Anne's Point S ½ E by the compass and they are about four or five leagues asunder Between these two Points there is a flat shoal which runs from Port Famine before Sedger river and three or four miles to the southward  We steered S S W with little wind along the shore  from Point Shutup towards Cape Forward and about three o'clock in the afternoon we passed by the French ship which we saw in a little cove about two leagues to the southward of Point Shutup She had hauled her stern close into the woods and we could see large piles of the wood which she had cut down lying on each side of her so that I made no doubt of her having been sent out to procure that necessary for their new settlement though I could not conceive why they should have come so far into the Streight for that purpose After my return to England I learnt that this vessel was the Eagle commanded by M Bougainville and that her business in the Streight was as I conjectured to cut wood for the French settlement in Falkland's Islands From Cape Shutup to Cape Forward the course by compass is S W by S and the distance is seven leagues At eight o'clock in the evening Cape Forward bore N W ½ W and was distant about a mile and we brought to for the night This part of the Streight is about eight miles over and off the Cape we had forty fathom within half a cable's length of the shore About four o'clock in the morning  we made sail and at eight having had light airs almost quite round the compass Cape Forward bore N E by E distant about four miles and Cape Holland W N W ½ W distant about five leagues At ten we had fresh gales at W N W and at intervals sudden squalls so violent as to oblige us to clew all up every time they came on We kept however working to windward and looking out for an anchoringplace endeavouring at the same time to reach a bay about two leagues to the westward of Cape Forward At five o'clock I sent a boat with an officer into this bay to sound who finding it fit for our purpose we entered it and about six o'clock anchored in nine fathom Cape Forward bore E ½ S distant  five miles  a small island which lies in the middle of the bay and is about a mile distant from the shore W by S distant about half a mile and a rivulet of fresh water N W by W distant three quarters of a mile  At six o'clock the next morning  we weighed and continued our course through the Streight from Cape Holland to Cape Gallant which are distant about eight leagues the coast lies W ½ S by the compass Cape Gallant is very high and steep and between this and Cape Holland lies a reach about three leagues over called English Reach About five miles south of Cape Gallant lies a large island called Charles's Island which it is necessary to keep to the northward of we sailed along the north shore of it at about two miles distance and sometimes much less A little to the eastward of Cape Holland is a fair sandy bay called Wood's Bay in which there is good anchoring The mountains on each side the Streight are I think higher and of a more desolate appearance than any other in the world except perhaps the Cordeliers both being rude craggy and steep and covered with snow from the top to the bottom  From Cape Gallant to Passage Point which are distant about three leagues the coast lies W by N by compass Passage Point is the east point of Elizabeth's bay and is low land with a rock lying off it Between this and Cape Gallant there are several islands some of them are very small but the eastermost which is Charles's Island that has been just mentioned is two leagues long the next is called Monmouth's Island and the westermost Rupert's Island Rupert's Island lies S by E of Point Passage These islands make the Streight narrow between Point Passage and Rupert's Island it is not more than two miles over and it is necessary to go to the northward of them all keeping the north shore on  board we sailed within two cables' length of it  and had no ground with forty fathom At six in the evening the wind shifted to the westward upon which we stood in for Elizabeth's Bay and anchored in ten fathom with very good ground the best anchoring however is in thirteen fathom for there was but three or four fathom about a cable's length within us In this Bay there is a good rivulet of fresh water We found the flood here set very strong to the eastward and according to our calculation it flows at the full and change of the moon about twelve o'clock We found the variation two points easterly  At two o'clock in the afternoon of Thursday the th  the wind being between the N W and W with fresh gales and squalls we made the signal to weigh and just as we had got the ship over the anchor a violent gust brought it home the ship immediately drove into shoal water within two cables' length of the shore upon which we let go the small bower in four fathom and had but three fathom under our stern the stream anchor was carried out with all possible expedition and by applying a purchase to the capstern the ship was drawn towards it we then heaved up both the bower anchors slipt the stream cable and with the gibb and staysails ran out into ten fathom and anchored with the best bower exactly in the situation from which we had been driven  At five o'clock the next morning the wind being northerly  and the weather moderate we weighed again and at seven passed Muscle bay which lies on the southern shore about a league to the westward of Elizabeth's Bay At eight we were abreast of Bachelor's River which is on the north shore about two leagues W by N from Elizabeth's Bay At nine we passed St Jerom's Sound the entrance of which is about a league from Bachelor's River when St Jerom's Sound  was open  it bore N W We then steered W S W by the compass for Cape Quod which is three leagues distant from the southermost point of the Sound Between Elizabeth Bay and Cape Quod is a reach about four miles over called Crooked Reach At the entrance of Jerom's Sound on the north side we saw three or four fires and soon afterwards perceived two or three canoes paddling after us At noon Cape Quod bore W S W ½ W distant four or five miles and soon after having light airs and calms we drove to the eastward with the flood tide in the mean time the canoes came up and after having paddled about us some time one of them had the resolution to come on board The canoe was of bark very ill made and the people on board which were four men two women and a boy were the poorest wretches I had ever seen They were all naked except a stinking seal skin that was thrown loosely over their shoulders they were armed however with bows and arrows which they readily gave me in return for a few beads and other trifles The arrows were made of a reed and pointed with a green stone they were about two feet long and the bows were three feet the cord of the bow was the dried gut of some animal In the evening we anchored abreast of Bachelor's River in fourteen fathom The entrance of the River bore N by E distant one mile and the northermost point of Saint Jerom's Sound W N W distant three miles About three quarters of a mile eastward of Bachelor's River is a shoal upon which there is not more than six feet water when the tide is out it is distant about half a mile from the shore and may be known by the weeds that are upon it The tide flows here at the full and change of the moon about one o'clock Soon after we were at anchor several Indians came on board us and I made them all presents of beads ribands and other trifles with which they appeared to be greatly  delighted  This visit I returned by going on shore among them taking only a few people with me in my jolly boat that I might not alarm them by numbers They received us with great expressions of kindness and to make us welcome they brought us some berries which they had gathered for that purpose and which with a few muscles seem to be a principal part if not the whole of their subsistence  At five o'clock in the morning of the d we weighed  and towed with the tide but at ten having no wind and finding that we drove again to the eastward we anchored with the stream anchor in fifteen fathom upon a bank which lies about half a mile from the north shore after veering about twothirds of a cable we had five and forty fathom alongside and still deeper water at a little distance The south point of Saint Jerom's Sound bore N N E distant two miles and Cape Quod W S W distant about eight miles From the south point of Saint Jerom's Sound to Cape Quod is three leagues in the direction of S W by W The tides in this Reach are exceedingly strong though very irregular we found them set to the eastward from nine o'clock in the morning till five o'clock the next morning and the other four hours from five to nine they set to the westward At twelve o'clock at night it began to blow very hard at W N W and at two in the morning  the ship drove off the bank we immediately hove the anchor up and found both the flukes broken off till three o'clock we had no ground and then we drove into sixteen fathom at the entrance of Saint Jerom's Sound as it still blew a storm we immediately let go the best bower and veered to half a cable The anchor brought the ship up at so critical a moment that we had but five fathom and even that depth was among breakers We let go the small bower under foot and at five finding the tide set to the westward and the weather  more moderate  we got up both the anchors and kept working to windward At ten we found the tide setting again strongly to the eastward and we therefore sent the boat back to seek for an anchoringplace which she found in a bay on the north shore about four miles to the eastward of Cape Quod and a little way within some small islands we endeavoured to get into this bay but the tide rushed out of it with such violence that we found it impossible and at noon bore away for York Road at the entrance of Bachelor's River where we anchored about an hour afterwards  At six o'clock the next morning  we weighed and worked with the tide which set the same as the day before but we could not gain an anchoringplace so that at noon we bore away for York Road again I took this opportunity to go up Bachelor's River in my jolly boat as high as I could which was about four miles in some places I found it very wide and deep and the water was good but near the mouth it is so shallow at low water that even a small boat cannot get into it  At six o'clock on the th  we weighed again and at eight it being stark calm we sent the boats ahead to tow at eleven however the tide set so strong from the westward that we could not gain the bay on the north shore which the boat had found for us on the th and which was an excellent harbour fit to receive five or six sail we were therefore obliged to anchor upon a bank in fortyfive fathom with the stream anchor Cape Quod bearing W S W distant five or six miles the south point of the island that lies to the east of the Cape being just in one with the pitch of it and a remarkable stone patch on the north shore bearing N ½ W distant half a mile Close to the shore here the depth of water was seventyfive fathom As soon as we were at anchor  I sent an officer to the westward to look out for a harbour but he did not succeed  It was calm the rest of the day and all night the tide setting to the eastward from the time we anchored till six o'clock the next morning  when we weighed and were towed by the boats to the westward At eight a fresh breeze sprung up at W S W and W and at noon Cape Quod bore E by S at the distance of about five miles In this situation I sent the boats out again to look for an anchoringplace and about noon by their direction we anchored in a little bay on the south shore opposite to Cape Quod in five and twenty fathom with very good ground A small rocky island bore W by N at the distance of about two cables' length the eastermost point E ½ S and Cape Quod N E by N distant about three miles in this place we had shellfish of various kinds in great plenty The Tamar not being able to work up to us anchored about two o'clock in the bay on the north shore about six miles to the eastward of Cape Quod which has been mentioned already During the night it was stark calm but in the morning having little airs of wind westerly  I weighed about eight o'clock and worked with the tide At noon Cape Quod bore E by S distant between two and three leagues and Cape Monday which is the westermost land in sight on the south shore W by N distant about ten or eleven leagues This part of the Streight lies W N W ½ W by the compass and is but four miles over so that the craggy mountains which bound it on each side towering above the clouds and covered with everlasting snow give it the most dreary and desolate appearance that can be imagined The tides here are not very strong the ebb sets to the westward but with an irregularity for which it is very difficult to account About one o'clock the Tamar anchored in the bay on the south shore opposite to Cape Quod which  we had just left  and we continued working to windward till seven in the evening when we anchored in a small bay on the north shore about five leagues to the westward of Cape Quod with very good ground This bay may be known by two large rocks that appear above water and a low point which makes the east part of the bay The anchoringplace is between the two rocks the eastermost bearing N E ½ E distant about two cables' length and the westermost which is near the point W N W ½ W at about the same distance there is also a small rock which shows itself among the weeds at low water and bears E ½ N distant about two cables' length If there are more ships than one they may anchor farther out in deeper water During the night it was calm and the weather became very foggy  but about ten in the morning it cleared up and I went on shore I found abundance of shellfish but saw no traces of people In the afternoon while the people were filling water I went up a deep lagoon which lies just round the westermost rock at the head of it I found a very fine fall of water and on the east side several little coves where ships of the greatest draught may lie in perfect security We saw nothing else worthy of notice and therefore having filled our boat with very large muscles we returned  At seven o'clock the next morning  we weighed and towed out of the bay and at eight saw the Tamar very far astern steering after us At noon we had little wind at E N E but at five o'clock it shifted to W N W and blew fresh At six we were abreast of Cape Monday and at six the next morning  Cape Upright bore E by S distant three leagues From Cape Monday to Cape Upright which are both on the south shore and distant from each other about five leagues the course is W by N by the compass the shore on each side is rocky with broken ground At about half an hour after  seven we had a very hard squall  and the weather being then exceedingly thick we suddenly perceived a reef of rocks close under our lee bow upon which the sea broke very high we had but just time to tack clear of them and if the ship had missed stays every soul on board must inevitably have perished These rocks lie at a great distance from the south shore and are about three leagues to the north of Cape Upright At nine the weather cleared a little and we saw the entrance of Long Reach upon which we bore away keeping nearest the south shore in hopes of finding an anchoringplace At ten we had strong gales and thick weather with hard rain and at noon we were again abreast of Cape Monday but could find no anchoringplace which however we continued to seek still steering along the south shore and were soon after joined by the Tamar who had been six or seven leagues to the eastward of us all night At six in the evening we anchored in a deep bay about three leagues to the eastward of Cape Monday we let go the anchor in five and twenty fathom near an island in the bottom of the bay but before we could bring up the ship we were driven off and the anchor took the ground in about fifty fathom The extream points of the bay bore from N W to N E by E and the island W ½ S we veered to a whole cable and the anchor was about a cable's length from the nearest shore In the night we had fresh gales westerly with sudden squalls and hard rain but in the morning the weather became more moderate  though it was still thick and the rain continued As a great swell set into this place and broke very high upon the rocks near which we lay I got up the anchor and warped the ship to a bank where the Tamar was riding we let go our anchor in fourteen fathom and moored with the stream anchor to the eastward in fortyfive fathom In the bottom of this  bay there is a bason  at the entrance of which there is but three fathom and an half at low water but within there is ten fathom and room enough for six or seven sail to lie where no wind can hurt them  We continued here till Friday the th and during all that time had one continued storm with impenetrable fogs and incessant rain  On the th I sent out the boat with an officer to look for harbours on the southern shore the boat was absent till the th  and then returned with an account that there were five bays between the ship's station and Cape Upright where we might anchor in great safety The officer told me that near Cape Upright he had fallen in with a few Indians who had given him a dog and that one of the women had offered him a child which was sucking at her breast It is scarcely necessary to say that he refused it but the offer seems to degrade these poor forlorn savages more than any thing in their appearance or manner of life it must be a strange depravity of nature that leaves them destitute of affection for their offspring or a most deplorable situation that impresses necessities upon them by which it is surmounted Some hills which when we first came to this place had no snow upon them were now covered and the winter of this dreary and inhospitable region seemed to have set in at once the poor seamen not only suffered much by the cold but had scarcely ever a dry thread about them I therefore distributed among the crews of both the ships not excepting the officers two bales of a thick woollen stuff called Fearnought which is provided by the government so that every body on board had now a warm jacket which at this time was found both comfortable and salutary  At eight o'clock in the morning of the th  we weighed and made sail and at three o'clock in the afternoon we were  once more abreast of Cape Monday and at five  we anchored in a bay on the east side of it The pitch of the Cape bore N W distant half a mile and the extream points of the bay from E to N by W We lay at about half a cable's length from the nearest shore which was a low island between the ship and the Cape  At six o'clock the next morning we weighed  and found that the palm was gone from the small bower anchor The wind was at W N W with hard rain at eight o'clock we found a strong current setting us to the eastward and at noon Cape Monday bore W N W distant two miles The Tamar being to windward of us fetched into the bay and anchored again We continued to lose ground upon every tack and therefore at two o'clock anchored upon the southern shore in sixteen fathom about five miles to the eastward of Cape Monday At three however I weighed again for the boat having sounded round the ship found the ground rocky The wind was N W with hard rain and we continued working all the rest of the day and all night every man on board being upon deck the whole time and every one wet to the skin for the rain or rather sheets of water that came down did not cease a moment  In the morning  we had again the mortification to find that notwithstanding all our labour we had lost ground upon every tack in consequence of the current which continued to set with great force to the eastward At eight o'clock we bore away and at nine anchored in the same bay from which we sailed on the th  The wind continued W and W N W without any tide to the westward all the th and th  and the weather was exceedingly bad with hard squalls and heavy rain In the mean time I had sent an officer with a boat to sound a bay  on the north shore  but he found no anchorage in it On the th at six o'clock in the morning a hard squall coming on the ship drove and brought the anchor off the bank into forty fathom but by heaving up the bower and carrying out the kedge anchor we got the ship on the bank again At eight  the day following though the wind was from W N W to S W we weighed and once more stood out of the bay the current still set very strongly to the eastward but at noon we found that we had gained about a mile and a half in a contrary direction The wind now became variable from S W to N W and at five in the afternoon the ship had gained about four miles to the westward but not being able to find an anchoringplace and the wind dying away we drove again very fast to the eastward with the current At six however we anchored in forty fathom with very good ground in a bay about two miles to the westward of that from which we sailed in the morning A swell rolled in here all night so that our situation was by no means desirable and therefore although the wind was still at W S W we weighed and made sail about eight o'clock the next day  we had still incessant rain so that the people were continually wet which was a great aggravation of their fatigue yet they were still cheerful and what was yet less to be expected still healthy This day to our great joy we found the current setting to the westward and we gained ground very fast At six in the evening we anchored in the bay on the east side of Cape Monday where the Tamar lay in eighteen fathom the pitch of the Cape bearing W by N distant half a mile We found this place very safe the ground being excellent and there being room enough for two or three ships of the line to moor  CHAP VII  The Passage from Cape Monday in the Streight of Magellan into the South Seas with some general Remarks on the Navigation of that Streight  AT eight the next morning we weighed  and soon after we made sail opened the South Sea from which such a swell rolled in upon us as I have seldom seen At four o'clock in the afternoon we anchored in a very good bay with a deep sound at the bottom by which it may be known about a league to the eastward of Cape Upright in fourteen fathom The extream point of the bay bore from N W to N E by E and Cape Upright W N W about a cable's length to the eastward of a low island which makes the bay  At three o'clock in the morning of the th I sent a boat  with an officer from each ship to look for anchoringplaces to the westward but at four in the afternoon they returned without having been able to get round Cape Upright  The next morning I sent the boats again to the westward  and about six in the evening they returned having been about four leagues and found two anchoringplaces but neither of them were very good We made sail however about eight in the forenoon of the next day and at three  Cape Upright bore E S E distant about three leagues a remarkable cape on the north shore at the same time bearing N E distant four or five miles This cape which is very lofty and steep lies N N W by compass from Cape Upright  at the distance of about three leagues  The south shore in this place had a very bad appearance many sunken rocks lying about it to a considerable distance upon which the sea breaks very high At four the weather became very thick and in less than half an hour we saw the south shore at the distance of about a mile but could get no anchoringplace we therefore tacked and stood over to the north shore At half an hour after six I made the Tamar's signal to come under our stern and ordered her to keep ahead of us all night and to show lights and fire a gun every time she changed her tack At seven it cleared up for a moment just to show us the north shore bearing W by N we tacked immediately and at eight the wind shifted from N N W to W N W and blew with great violence Our situation was now very alarming the storm increased every minute the weather was extremely thick the rain seemed to threaten another deluge we had a long dark night before us we were in a narrow channel and surrounded on every side by rocks and breakers We attempted to clew up the mizentopsail but before this service could be done it was blown all to rags we then brought to with the main and foretopsail close reefed and upon the cap keeping the ship's head to the south west but there being a prodigious sea it broke over us so often that the whole deck was almost continually under water At nine by an accidental breaking of the fog we saw the high Cape on the north shore that has been just mentioned bearing east at about a mile distance but had entirely lost sight of the Tamar At half an hour after three in the morning  we suddenly perceived ourselves close to a high land on the south shore upon which we wore and brought to to the northward The gale still continued if possible with increasing violence and the rain poured down in torrents so that we were in a manner immersed in water  and expected every moment to be among the breakers  The long wishedfor day at length broke but the weather was still so thick that no land was to be seen though we knew it could not be far distant till after six when we saw the south shore at about the distance of two miles and soon after to our great satisfaction we saw the Tamar at this time Cape Monday bore S E distant about four miles and the violence of the gale not abating we bore away About seven both ships came to an anchor in the bay which lies to the eastward of Cape Monday notwithstanding the sea that rolled in for we were glad to get anchorage any where We had now been twice within four leagues of Tuesday's Bay at the western entrance of the Streight and had been twice driven back ten or twelve leagues by such storms as we had now just experienced When the season is so far advanced as it was when we attempted the passage of this Streight it is a most difficult and dangerous undertaking as it blows a hurricane incessantly night and day and the rain is as violent and constant as the wind with such fogs as often render it impossible to discover any object at the distance of twice the ship's length This day our best bower cable being quite rubbed to pieces we cut it into junk and bent a new one which we rounded with old rigging eight fathom from the anchor  In the afternoon of the day following  the Tamar parted a new best bower cable it being cut by the rock and drove over to the east side of the bay where she was brought up at a very little distance from some rocks against which she must otherwise have been dashed to pieces  At seven o'clock in the morning of the th  we weighed and found our small bower cable very much rubbed by the foul ground so that we were obliged to cut no less than six  and twenty fathom of it off  and bend it again In about half an hour the Tamar being very near the rocks and not being able to purchase her anchor made signals of distress I was therefore obliged to stand into the bay again and having anchored I sent hawsers on board the Tamar and heaved her up while she purchased her anchor after which we heaved her to windward and at noon being got into a proper birth she anchored again We continued in our station all night  and the next morning a gale came on at W N W which was still more violent than any that had preceded it the water was torn up all round us and carried much higher than the masts heads a dreadful sea at the same time rolling in so that knowing the ground to be foul we were in constant apprehension of parting our cables in which case we must have been almost instantly dashed to atoms against the rocks that were just to leeward of us and upon which the sea broke with inconceivable fury and a noise not less loud than thunder We lowered all the main and fore yards let go the small bower veered a cable and an half on the best bower and having bent the sheet cable stood by the anchor all the rest of the day and till midnight the sea often breaking halfway up our main shrouds About one in the morning the weather became somewhat more moderate  but continued to be very dark rainy and tempestuous till midnight when the wind shifted to the S W and soon afterwards it became comparatively calm and clear  The next morning  which was the first of April we had a stark calm with now and then some light airs from the eastward but the weather was again thick with hard rain and we found a current setting strongly to the eastward At four o'clock we got up the lower yards unbent the sheet cable and weighed the small bower at eight we weighed  the best bower  and found the cable very much rubbed in several places which we considered as a great misfortune it being a fine new cable which never had been wet before At eleven we hove short on the stream anchor but soon after it being calm and a thick fog coming on with hard rain we veered away the stream cable and with a warp to the Tamar heaved the ship upon the bank again and let go the small bower in two and twenty fathom  At six in the evening we had strong gales at W N W with violent squalls and much rain and continued in our station till the morning of the d  when I sent the Tamar's boat with an officer from each ship to the westward in search of anchoringplaces on the south shore and at the same time I sent my own cutter with an officer to seek anchoringplaces on the north shore  The cutter returned the next morning at six o'clock  having been about five leagues to the westward upon the north shore and found two anchoringplaces The officer reported that having been on shore he had fallen in with some Indians who had with them a canoe of a construction very different from any that they had seen in the Streight before this vessel consisted of planks sewed together but all the others were nothing more than the bark of large trees tied together at the ends and kept open by short pieces of wood which were thrust in transversely between the two sides like the boats which children make of a bean shell The people he said were the nearest to brutes in their manner and appearance of any he had seen they were like some which we had met with before quite naked notwithstanding the severity of the weather except part of a seal skin which was thrown over their shoulders and they eat their food which was such as no other animal but a hog would touch  without any dressing  they had with them a large piece of whale blubber which stunk intolerably and one of them tore it to pieces with his teeth and gave it about to the rest who devoured it with the voracity of a wild beast They did not however look upon what they saw in the possession of our people with indifference for while one of them was asleep they cut off the hinder part of his jacket with a sharp flint which they use as a knife  About eight o'clock we made sail and found little or no current At noon Cape Upright bore W S W distant three leagues and at six in the evening we anchored in the bay on the southern shore which lies about a league to the eastward of the Cape and had fifteen fathom water  While we were lying here and taking in wood and water seven or eight Indians in a canoe came round the western point of the bay and having landed opposite to the ship made a fire We invited them to me on board by all the signs we could devise but without success I therefore took the jolly boat and went on shore to them I introduced myself by making them presents of several trifles with which they seemed to be much gratified and we became very intimate in a few minutes after we had spent some time together I sent away my people in the boat for some bread and remained on shore with them alone When the boat returned with the bread I divided it among them and I remarked with equal pleasure and surprise that if a bit of the biscuit happened to fall not one of them offered to touch it till I gave my consent In the mean time some of my people were cutting a little grass for two or three sheep which I had still left on board and at length the Indians perceiving what they were doing ran immediately and tearing up all the weeds they could get carried them to the  boat  which in a very short time was filled almost up to her gunwale I was much gratified by this token of their goodwill and I could perceive that they were pleased with the pleasure that I expressed upon the occasion they had indeed taken such a fancy to us that when I returned on board the boar they all got into their canoe and followed me When we came near the ship however they stopped and gazed at her as if held in surprise by a mixture of astonishment and terror but at last though not without some difficulty I prevailed upon four or five of them to venture on board As soon as they entered the ship I made them several presents and in a very little time they appeared to be perfectly at ease As I was very desirous to entertain them one of the midshipmen played upon the violin and some of my people danced at this they were so much delighted and so impatient to show their gratitude that one of them went over the ship's side into the canoe and fetched up a seal skin bag of red paint and immediately smeared the fiddler's face all over with it he was very desirous to pay me the same compliment which however I thought fit to decline but he made many very vigorous efforts to get the better of my modesty and it was not without some difficulty that I defended myself from receiving the honour he designed me in my own despight After having diverted and entertained them several hours I intimated that it would be proper for them to go on shore but their attachment was such that it was by no means an easy matter to get them out of the ship Their canoe was not of bark but of planks sewed together  On Sunday the th  at six o'clock in the morning we weighed with a moderate breeze at E N E and fine weather At seven we were abreast of Cape Upright and at noon it bore E S E distant four leagues soon after we tried  the current  and found it set to the eastward at the rate of a knot and an half an hour At three it fell calm and the current driving us to the eastward very fast we dropped an anchor which before it took the ground was in one hundred and twenty fathom  This day and not before the Tamar's boat returned from the westward she had been within two or three leagues of Cape Pillar and had found several very good anchoringplaces on the south more  At one o'clock the next morning  having a fresh gale at west we weighed notwithstanding the weather was thick and made sail at eleven it blew very hard with violent rain and a great sea and as we perceived that we rather lost than gained ground we stood in for a bay on the south shore about four leagues to the westward of Cape Upright and anchored in twenty fathom the ground was not good but in other respects this was one of the best harbours that we had met with in the Streight for it was impossible that any wind should hurt us There being less wind in the afternoon and it inclining a little towards the south we unmoored at two and at four the wind having then come round to the S S E and being a moderate breeze we weighed and steered to the westward we made about two leagues and an half but night then coming on we anchored not without great difficulty in a very good bay on the south shore in twenty fathom As very violent gusts came from the land we were very near being driven off before we could let go an anchor and if we had not at last succeeded we must have passed a dreadful night in the Streight for it blew a hurricane from the time we came to an anchor till the morning with violent rain which was sometimes intermingled with snow  At six o'clock  the wind being still fresh and squally at S S E we weighed and steered W by N along the south shore At eleven we were abreast of Cape Pillar which by compass is about fourteen leagues W ½ N from Cape Upright Cape Pillar may be known by a large gap upon the top and when it bears WSW an island appears off it which has an appearance somewhat like a haystack and about which lie several rocks The Streight to the eastward of the Cape is between seven and eight leagues over the land on each side is of a moderate height but it is lowest on the north shore the south shore being much the boldest though both are craggy and broken Westminster Island is nearer to the north than the south shore and by the compass lies N E from Cape Pillar The land on the north shore near the west end of the Streight makes in many islands and rocks upon which the sea breaks in a tremendous manner The land about Cape Victory is distant from Cape Pillar about ten or eleven leagues in the direction of N W by N From the Cape westward the coast trends S S W ½ W to Cape Deseada a low point off which lie innumerable rocks and breakers About four leagues W S W from Cape Deseada lie some dangerous rocks called by Sir John Narborough the Judges upon which a mountainous surf always breaks with inconceivable fury Four small islands called the Islands of Direction are distant from Cape Pillar about eight leagues in the direction of N W by W When we were off this Cape it was stark calm but I never saw such a swell as rolled in here nor such a surge as broke on each shore I expected every moment that the wind would spring up from its usual quarter and that the best which could happen to us would be to be driven many leagues up the streight again Contrary however to all expectation a  fine steady gale sprung up at S E to which I spread all the sail that it was possible for the ship to bear  and ran off from this frightful and desolate coast at the rate of nine miles an hour so that by eight o'clock in the evening we had left it twenty leagues behind us And now to make the ship as stiff as possible I knocked down our after bulkhead and got two of the boats under the halfdeck I also placed my twelve oared cutter under the boom so that we had nothing upon the skids but the jolly boat and the alteration which this made in the vessel is inconceivable for the weight of the boats upon the skids made her crank and in a great sea they were also in danger of being lost  It is probable that whoever shall read this account of the difficulties and dangers which attended our passage through the Streight of Magellan will conclude that it ought never to be attempted again but that all ships which shall hereafter sail a western course from Europe into the South Seas ought to go round Cape Horn I however who have been twice round Cape Horn am of a different opinion I think that at a proper season of the year not only a single vessel but a large squadron might pass the Streight in less than three weeks and I think to take the proper season they should be at the eastern entrance some time in the month of December One great advantage of this passage is the facility with which fish is almost every where to be procured with wild celery scurvygrass berries and many other vegetables in great abundance for to this I impute the heathiness of my ship's company not a single man being affected with the scurvy in the slightest degree nor upon the sick list for any other disorder notwithstanding the hardship and labour which they endured in the passage which cost us seven weeks and two days as we entered  the Streight on Sunday the th of February  and quitted it on Tuesday the th of April Wood and water are also to be procured almost at every anchoringplace beyond Fresh Water Bay Our sufferings I impute wholly to our passing the Streight just as the sun approached the equinox when in this high latitude the worst weather was to be expected and indeed the weather we had was dreadful beyond all description  CHAP VIII  The Run from the Western Entrance of the Streight of Magellan to the Islands of Disappointment  HAVING cleared the Streight we pursued our course to the westward as appears by the track in the chart till Friday April the th  when we discovered the island of Masafuero bearing W N W ½ W distant about sixteen leagues but as to the northward it was hazey the island of Don Juan Fernandes was not in sight During this run the variation had gradually decreased from ° to ° ′ E  We bore away for Masafuero and at sunset being within about seven leagues of it we brought to and afterwards kept the wind all night  At daybreak the next day we bore away again for the island at the same time sending an officer with a boat from each ship to sound the eastern side of it About noon the middle of the island bore W distant about three miles and as I saw the boats run along the shore without being able to land any where for the surf I bore down to the north part of the island off which a reef runs for the distance of about two miles and lay by for them This island is very high and the greater part of it is covered with wood but towards the north end where I lay some spots seemed to have been cleared upon which great numbers of goats were feeding and they had a green and pleasant appearance When the boats returned the officer informed me that he had found a bank on the east side of the island nearest to the south point at a considerable distance from the shore where we might anchor and opposite  to which there was a fine fall of fresh water  but near the north point he said he could find no anchorage The boats brought off a great quantity of very fine fish which they had caught with hook and line near the shore and as soon as we had taken them on board which was late in the afternoon we made sail and worked to windward in the night  At seven o'clock in the morning  we anchored with the small bower on the bank which the boats had discovered in twentyfour fathom with black sandy ground The extream points bore from S to N W and the fall of water bore S S W distant about a mile from the ship's station This part of the island lies north and south and is about four miles long the soundings are very regular from twenty to fifteen fathom within two cables' length of the shore Soon after we were come to an anchor I sent out the boats to endeavour to get some wood and water but as I observed the shore to be rocky and a surf to break with great violence upon it I ordered all the men to put on cork jackets which had been sent with us to be made use of upon such occasions By the help of these jackets which not only assisted the men in swimming but prevented their being bruised against the rocks we got off a considerable quantity of water and wood which without such assistance we could not have done there was however another species of danger here against which cork jackets afforded no defence for the sea abounded with sharks of an enormous size which when they saw a man in the water would dart into the very surf to seize him our people however happily escaped them though they were many times very near one of them which was upwards of twenty feet long came close to one of the boats that was watering and having seized a large seal instantly devoured it at one mouthful and I myself saw another  of nearly the same size  do the same thing under the ship's stern Our people killed and sent off several of the goats which we thought as good as the best venison in England and I observed that one of them appeared to have been caught and marked its right ear being slit in a manner that could not have happened by accident We had also fish in such plenty that one boat would with hooks and lines catch in a few hours as much as would serve a large ship's company two days they were of various sorts all excellent in their kind and many of them weighed from twenty to thirty pounds  This evening the surf running very high the gunner and one of the seamen who were on shore with the waterers were afraid to venture off and the boat therefore when she came on board the last time left them behind her  The next day we found a more convenient wateringplace  about a mile and a half to the northward of the ship and about the middleway between the north and south points of the island there being at this place less surf than where the boats first went on shore The tide here set twelve hours to the northward and twelve to the southward which we found very convenient for as the wind was southerly with a great swell the boats could not otherwise have got on board with their water We got off ten tons of water from the new wateringplace this day and in the afternoon I sent a boat to fetch off the gunner and seaman who had been left on shore at the old wateringplace the night before but the surf was still so great that the seaman who could not swim was afraid to venture he was therefore again left behind and the gunner stayed with him  As soon as this was reported to me I sent another boat to inform them that as by the appearances of the weather  there was reason to believe it would soon blow hard  I was afraid I might be driven off the bank in the night the consequence of which would be that they must be left behind upon the island When the boat came to the surf the people on board delivered my message upon which the gunner swam through the surf and got on board her but the seaman though he had a cork jacket on said he was sure he should be drowned if he attempted to get off to the boat and that chusing rather to die a natural death he was determined at all events to remain upon the island he then took an affectionate leave of the people wishing them all happiness and the people on board returned his good wishes One of the midshipmen however just as the boat was about to return took the end of a rope in his hand jumped into the sea and swam through the surf to the beach where poor John still continued ruminating upon his situation in a dejected attitude and with a most disconsolate length of countenance The midshipman began to expostulate with him upon the strange resolution he had taken and in the mean time having made a running knot in his rope he dexterously contrived to throw it round his body calling out to his companions in the boat who had hold of the other end of it to haul away they instantly took the hint and the poor seceder was very soon dragged through the surf into the boat he had however swallowed so great a quantity of water that he was to all appearance dead but being held up by the heels he soon recovered his speech and motion and was perfectly well the next day In the evening I removed Captain Mouat from the Tamar and appointed him Captain of the Dolphin under me Mr Cumming my First Lieutenant I appointed Captain of the Tamar taking Mr Carteret her First Lieutenant on board  in his room and gave Mr Kendal one of the mates of the Dolphin a commission as Second Lieutenant of the Tamar  On the th  at seven o'clock in the morning we weighed and steered to the northward along the east and north east side of the island but could find no anchoringplace we bore away therefore with a fresh gale at S E and hazey weather and at noon the middle of the island was distant eight leagues in the direction of S S E I continued to steer N ° W the next day  and at noon on the d of May I changed my course and steered W intending if possible to make the land which is called Davis's Land in the charts and is laid down in latitude ° ′ S and about five hundred leagues west of Copiapo in Chili  but on the th finding little prospect of getting to the westward in the latitude which I at first proposed being then in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W and having a great run to make I determined to steer a north west course till I got the true tradewind and then to stand to the westward till I should fall in with Solomon's Islands if any such there were or make some new discovery  On the th  we saw several dolphins and bonettas about the ship  and the next day some straggling birds which were brown on the back and the upper part of their wings and white on the rest of the body with a short beak and a short pointed tail The variation was now decreased to ° ′ E our latitude was ° ′ S our longitude ° ′ W  On the th  we saw several grampuses and more of the birds which have just been described so that imagining we might be near some land we kept a good lookout but saw nothing In latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W the variation by azimuth was ° ′ E  On the morning of the th  we saw two very remarkable birds they flew very high were as large as geese and all over as white as snow except their legs which were black I now began to imagine that I had passed some land or islands which lay to the southward of us for the last night we observed that although we had generally a great swell from that quarter the water became quite smooth for a few hours after which the swell returned  On the d being in latitude ° ′ S  longitude ° ′ W with a faint breeze at E S E we had so great a swell from the southward that we were in perpetual danger of our masts rolling over the ship's side so that I was obliged to haul more to the northward as well to ease the ship as in hopes of getting the true tradewind which we had not yet and now to my great concern some of my best men began to complain of the scurvy This day for the first time we caught two bonettas we also saw several tropic birds about the ship and observed that they were larger than any we had seen before their whole plumage was white and they had two long feathers in the tail The variation now had changed its direction and was ′ W  On the th we saw two large birds about the ship  which were all black except the neck and the beak which were white they had long wings and long feathers in their tail yet we observed that they flew heavily and therefore imagined that they were of a species which did not usually fly far from the shore I had flattered myself that before we had run six degrees to the northward of Masafuero we should have found a settled tradewind to the S E but the winds still continued to the north though we had a mountainous swell from the S W Our latitude was now ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W and here the needle at this time had no variation  On the th  we saw two fine large birds about the ship one of which was brown and white and the other black and white they wanted much to settle upon the yards but the working of the ship frighted them  On the st  the wind shifted from N by W to N W by W and the number of birds that were now about the ship was very great from these circumstances and our having lost the great south west swell I imagined some land to be near and we looked out for it with great diligence for our people began now to fall down with the scurvy very fast  We saw no land however till one o'clock in the morning of Friday the th of June  when we were in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W and observed the variation to be ° ′ E After making the land I hauled upon a wind under an easy sail till the morning and then a low small island bore from us W S W at the distance of about two leagues In a very short time we saw another island to windward of us bearing ESE distant between three and four leagues this appeared to be much larger than that which we first discovered and we must have passed very near it in the night  I stood for the small island which as we drew near it had a most beautiful appearance it was surrounded by a beach of the finest white sand and within it was covered with tall trees which extended their shade to a great distance and formed the most delightful groves that can be imagined without underwood We judged this island to be about five miles in circumference and from each end of it we saw a spit running out into the sea upon which the surge broke with great fury there was also a great surf all round it We soon perceived that it was inhabited for many of the natives appeared upon the beach with spears in their hands  that were at least sixteen feet long  They presently made several large fires which we supposed to be a signal for we immediately perceived several fires upon the larger island that was to windward of us by which we knew that also to be inhabited I sent the boat with an officer to look for an anchoringplace who to our great regret and disappointment returned with an account that he had been all round the island and that no bottom could be found within less than a cable's length of the shore which was surrounded close to the beach with a steep coral rock The scurvy by this time had made dreadful havock among us many of my best men being now confined to their hammocks the poor wretches who were able to crawl upon the deck stood gazing at this little paradise which Nature had forbidden them to enter with sensations which cannot easily be conceived they saw cocoanuts in great abundance the milk of which is perhaps the most powerful antiscorbutic in the world they had reason to suppose that there were limes bananas and other fruits which are generally found between the tropics and to increase their mortification they saw the shells of many turtle scattered about the shore These refreshments indeed for want of which they were languishing to death were as effectually beyond their reach as if there had been half the circumference of the world between them yet their being in sight was no inconsiderable increase of the distress which they suffered by the want of them Their situation in itself indeed was no worse than it would have been if the obstacle to their wishes had been distance and not a reef of rocks and both being alike insuperable a Being wholly under the influence of reason would by both have been equally affected but this is a situation among many others that may be remarked by a diligent observer in which reason cannot preserve man  kind from the power which fancy is perpetually exerting to aggravate the calamities of life  When I knew the soundings I could not forbear standing close round the island with the ship though I also knew it was impossible to procure any of the refreshments which it produced The natives ran along the shore abreast of the ship shouting and dancing they also frequently brandished their long spears and then threw themselves backward and lay a few minutes motionless as if they had been dead this we understood as a menace that they would kill us if we ventured to go on shore As we were sailing along the coast we took notice that in one place the natives had fixed upright in the sand two spears to the top of which they had fastened several things that fluttered in the air and that some of them were every moment kneeling down before them as we supposed invoking the assistance of some invisible Being to defend them against us While I was thus circumnavigating the island with the ship I sent the boats out again to sound and when they came near the shore the Indians set up one of the most hideous yells I had ever heard pointing at the same time to their spears and poising in their hands large stones which they took up from the beach Our men on the contrary made all the signs of amity and goodwill that they could devise and at the same time threw them bread and many other things none of which they vouchsafed so much as to touch but with great expedition hauled five or six large canoes which we saw lying upon the beach up into the wood When this was done they waded into the water and seemed to watch for an opportunity of laying hold of the boat that they might drag her on shore the people on board her apprehending that this was their design and that if they got them on shore they would certainly put them to death were very impatient to be beforehand with them  and would fain have fired upon them  but the officer on board having no permission from me to commit any hostilities restrained them I should indeed have thought myself at liberty to have obtained by force the refreshments for want of which our people were dying if it had been possible to have come to an anchor supposing we could not have made these poor savages our friends but nothing could justify the taking away their lives for a mere imaginary or intentional injury without procuring the least advantage to ourselves They were of a deep copper colour exceedingly stout and well limbed and remarkably nimble and active for I never saw men run so fast in my life This island lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W from the meridian of London As the boats reported a second time that there was no anchoring ground about this island I determined to work up to the other which was accordingly done all the rest of the day and the following night  At six o'clock in the morning of the th  we brought to on the west side of it at the distance of about three quarters of a mile from the shore but we had no soundings with one hundred and forty fathom of line We now perceived several other low islands or rather peninsulas most of them being joined one to the other by a neck of land very narrow and almost level with the surface of the water which breaks high over it In approaching these islands the cocoanut trees are first discovered as they are higher than any part of the surface I sent a boat with an officer from each ship to sound the leeside of these islands for an anchoringplace and as soon as they left the ship I saw the Indians run down to the beach in great numbers armed with long spears and clubs they kept abreast of the boats as they went sounding along the shore and used many threatening  gestures to prevent their landing  I therefore fired a nine pound shot from the ship over their heads upon which they ran into the woods with great precipitation At ten o'clock the boats returned but could get no soundings close in with the surf which broke very high upon the shore The middle of this cluster of islands lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W the variation of the compass was here ° ′ E  At half an hour after ten we bore away and made sail to the westward finding it impossible to procure at these islands any refreshment for our sick whose situation was becoming more deplorable every hour and I therefore called them the ISLANDS OF DISAPPOINTMENT  CHAP IX  The Discovery of King George's Islands with a Description of them and an Account of several Incidents that happened there  AT half an hour after five o'clock in the afternoon of the th we saw land again  bearing W S W at the distance of six or seven leagues and at seven we brought to for the night In the morning  being within three miles of the shore we discovered it to be a long low island with a white beach of a pleasant appearance full of cocoanut and other trees and surrounded with a rock of red coral We stood along the north east side of it within half a mile of the shore and the savages as soon as they saw us made great fires as we supposed to alarm the distant inhabitants of the island and ran along the beach abreast of the ship in great numbers armed in the same manner as the natives of the Islands of Disappointment Over the land on this side of the island we could see a large lake of salt water or lagoon which appeared to be two or three leagues wide and to reach within a small distance of the opposite shore Into this lagoon we saw a small inlet about a league from the south west point off which we brought to At this place the natives have built a little town under the shade of a fine grove of cocoanut trees I immediately sent off the boats with an officer in each to sound but they could find no anchorage the shore being every where as steep as a wall except at the very mouth of the inlet which was  scarcely a ship's length wide  and there they had thirteen fathom with a bottom of coral rock We stood close in with the ships and saw hundreds of the savages ranged in very good order and standing up to their waists in water they were all armed in the same manner as those that we had seen at the other islands and one of them carried a piece of mat fastened to the top of a pole which we imagined was an ensign They made a most hideous and incessant noise and in a short time many large canoes came down the lake to join them Our boats were still out and the people on board them made all the signs of friendship that they could invent upon which some of the canoes came through the inlet and drew near them We now began to hope that a friendly intercourse might be established but we soon discovered that the Indians had no other design than to haul the boats on shore many of them leaped off the rocks and swam to them and one of them got into that which belonged to the Tamar and in the twinkling of an eye seized a seaman's jacket and jumping overboard with it never once appeared above water till he was close in shore among his companions Another of them got hold of a midshipman's hat but not knowing how to take it off he pulled it downward instead of lifting it up so that the owner had time to prevent its being taken away otherwise it would probably have disappeared as suddenly as the jacket our men bore all this with much patience and the Indians seemed to triumph in their impunity  About noon finding there was no anchorage here I bore away and steered along the shore to the westermost point of the island the boats immediately followed us and kept founding close to the beach but could get no ground  When we came to the westermost point of this island  we saw another bearing S W by W about four leagues distant We were at this time about a league beyond the inlet where we had left the natives but they were not satisfied with having got rid of us quietly for I now perceived two large double canoes sailing after the ship with about thirty men in each all armed after the manner of their country The boats were a good way to leeward of us and the canoes passing between the ship and the shore seemed very eagerly to give them chace Upon this I made the signal for the boats to speak with the canoes and as soon as they perceived it they turned and made towards the Indians who seeing this were seized with a sudden pannic and immediately hauling down their sails paddled back again at a surprising rate Our boats however came up with them but notwithstanding the dreadful surf that broke upon the shore the canoes pushed through it and the Indians immediately hauled them up upon the beach Our boats followed them and the Indians dreading an invasion of their coast prepared to defend it with clubs and stones upon which our men fired and killed two or three of them one of them received three balls which went quite through his body yet he afterwards took up a large stone and died in the action of throwing it against his enemy This man fell close to our boats so that the Indians who remained unhurt did not dare to attempt the carrying off his body which gave us an opportunity to examine it but they carried off the rest of their dead and made the best of their way back to their companions at the inlet Our boats then returned and brought off the two canoes which they had pursued One of them was thirtytwo feet long and the other somewhat less but they were both of a very curious construction and  must have cost those who made them infinite labour  They consisted of planks exceedingly well wrought and in many places adorned with carving these planks were sewed together and over every seam there was a strip of tortoiseshell very artificially fastened to keep out the weather their bottoms were as sharp as a wedge and they were very narrow and therefore two of them were joined laterally together by a couple of strong spars so that there was a space of about six or eight feet between them a mast was hoisted in each of them and the sail was spread between the masts the sail which I preserved and which is now in my possession is made of matting and is as neat a piece of work as ever I saw their paddles were very curious and their cordage was as good and as well laid as any in England though it appeared to be made of the outer covering of the cocoanut When these vessels sail several men fit upon the spars which hold the canoes together  As the surf which broke very high upon the shore rendered it impossible to procure refreshments for the sick in this part of the island I hauled the wind and worked back to the inlet being determined to try once more what could be done there  I recovered that station in the afternoon and immediately sent the boats to sound the inlet again but they confirmed the account which had been made before that it afforded no anchorage for a ship While the boats were absent I observed a great number of the natives upon the point near the spot where we had left them in the morning and they seemed to be very busy in loading a great number of large canoes which lay close to the beach As I thought they might be troublesome and was unwilling that they should suffer  by another unequal contest with our people  I fired a shot over their heads which produced the effect I intended for they all disappeared in a moment  Just before the evening closed in our boats landed and got a few cocoanuts which they brought off but saw none of the inhabitants In the night during which we had rain and hard squalls I stood off and on with the ships and at seven o'clock in the morning brought to off the inlet  I immediately sent the boats on shore in search of refreshments and made all the men who were not so ill of the scurvy as to be laid up go in them I also went on shore myself and continued there the whole day We saw many houses or wigwams of the natives but they were totally deserted except by the dogs who kept an incessant howling from the time we came on shore till we returned to the ship they were low mean hovels thatched with cocoanut branches but they were most delightfully situated in a fine grove of stately trees many of which were the cocoanut and many such as we were utterly unacquainted with The cocoanut trees seem to furnish them with almost all the necessaries of life particularly food sails cordage timber and vessels to hold water so that probably these people always fix their habitations where the trees abound We observed the shore to be covered with coral and the shells of very large pearl oysters so that I make no doubt but that as profitable a pearl fishery might be established here as any in the world We saw but little of the people except at a distance we could however perceive that the women had a piece of cloth of some kind probably fabricated of the same stuff as their sail hanging from the waist as low as the knee the men were naked  Our people  in rummaging some of the huts found the carved head of a rudder which had manifestly belonged to a Dutch longboat and was very old and wormeaten They found also a piece of hammerediron a piece of brass and some small iron tools which the ancestors of the present inhabitants of this place probably obtained from the Dutch ship to which the longboat had belonged all which I brought away with me Whether these people found means to cut off the ship or whether she was lost upon the island or after she left it cannot be known but there is reason to believe that she never returned to Europe because no account of her voyage or of any discoveries that she made is extant If the ship sailed from this place in safety it is not perhaps easy to account for her leaving the rudder of her longboat behind her and if she was cut off by the natives there must be much more considerable remains of her in the island especially of her ironwork upon which all Indian nations who have no metal set the highest value we had no opportunities however to examine this matter farther The hammerediron brass and iron tools I brought away with me but we found a tool exactly in the form of a carpenter's adze the blade of which was a pearl oystershell possibly this might have been made in imitation of an adze which had belonged to the carpenter of the Dutch ship for among the tools that I brought away there was one which seemed to be the remains of such an implement though it was worn away almost to nothing  Close to the houses of these people we saw buildings of another kind which appeared to be buryingplaces and from which we judged that they had great veneration for their dead They were situated under lofty trees that gave a thick shade the sides and tops were of stone and in their  figure they somewhat resembled the square tombs  with a flat top which are always to be found in our country churchyards Near these buildings we found many neat boxes full of human bones and upon the branches of the trees which shaded them hung a great number of the heads and bones of turtle and a variety of fish inclosed in a kind of basketwork of reeds some of the fish we took down and found that nothing remained but the skin and the teeth the bones and entrails seemed to have been extracted and the muscular flesh dried away  We sent off several boatloads of cocoanuts and a great quantity of scurvygrass with which the island is covered refreshments which were of infinite service to us as by this time I believe there was not a man among us wholly untouched by the scurvy  The fresh water here is very good but it is scarce the wells which supply the natives are so small that when two or three cocoanut shells have been filled from them they are dry for a few minutes but as they presently fill again if a little pains were taken to enlarge them they would abundantly supply any ship with water  We saw no venomous creature here but the flies were an intolerable torment they covered us from head to foot and filled not only the boat but the ships We saw great numbers of parrots and parroquets and several other birds which were altogether unknown to us we saw also a beautiful kind of dove so tame that some of them frequently came close to us and even followed us into the Indian huts  All this day the natives kept themselves closely concealed and did not even make a smoke upon any part of the islands as far as we could see probably fearing that a smoke might  discover the place of their retreat  In the evening we all returned on board the ship  This part of the island lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W and after I got on board I hauled a little way farther from the shore intending to visit the other island in the morning which had been seen to the westward of that before which the ship lay and which is distant about sixtynine leagues from the Islands of Disappointment in the direction of W ½ S  The next morning  at six o'clock I made sail for the island which I intended to visit and when I reached it I steered S W by W close along the north east side of it but could get no soundings this side is about six or seven leagues long and the whole makes much the same appearance as the other having a large salt water lake in the middle of it As soon as the ship came in sight the natives ran down to the beach in great numbers they were armed in the same manner as those that we had seen upon the other island and kept abreast of the ship for several leagues As the heat of this climate is very great they seemed to suffer much by running so far in the sun for they sometimes plunged into the sea and sometimes fell flat upon the sand that the surf might break over them after which they renewed the race with great vigour Our boats were at this time sounding along the shore as usual but I had given strict orders to the officers who commanded them never to molest the natives except it should become absolutely necessary for their own defence but to try all possible means to obtain their confidence and goodwill our people therefore went as near to the shore as they durst for the surf and made signs that they wanted water the Indians readily understood them and directed them to run down farther along the shore  which they did  till they came abreast of such a cluster of houses as we had just left upon the other island to this place the Indians still followed them and were there joined by many others the boats immediately hauled close into the surf and we brought to with the ships at a little distance from the shore upon which a stout old man with a long white beard that gave him a very venerable appearance came down from the houses to the beach He was attended by a young man and appeared to have the authority of a Chief or King the rest of the Indians at a signal which he made retired to a little distance and he then advanced quite to the water's edge in one hand he held the green branch of a tree and in the other he grasped his beard which he pressed to his bosom in this attitude he made a long oration or rather song for it had a musical cadence which was by no means disagreeable We regretted infinitely that we could not understand what he said to us and not less that he could not understand any thing which we should say to him to shew our goodwill however we threw him some trifling presents while he was yet speaking but he would neither touch them himself nor suffer them to be touched by others till he had done he then walked into the water and threw our people the green branch after which he took up the things which had been thrown from the boats Every thing now having a friendly appearance our people made signs that they should lay down their arms and most of them having complied one of the midshipmen encouraged by this testimony of confidence and friendship leaped out of the boat with his clothes on and swam through the surf to the shore The Indians immediately gathered round him and began to examine his clothes with great curiosity they seemed particularly to admire his waistcoat and being willing to gratify his new friends he took it off and presented  it to them  this courtesy however produced a disagreeable effect for he had no sooner given away his waistcoat than one of the Indians very ingeniously untied his cravat and the next moment snatched it from his neck and ran away with it Our adventurer therefore to prevent his being stripped by piecemeal made the best of his way back again to the boat still however we were upon good terms and several of the Indians swam off to our people some of them bringing a cocoanut and others a little fresh water in a cocoanut shell But the principal object of our boats was to obtain some pearls and the men to assist them in explaining their meaning had taken with them some of the pearl oyster shells which they had found in great numbers upon the coast but all their endeavours were ineffectual for they could not even with this assistance at all make themselves understood It is indeed probable that we should have succeeded better if an intercourse of any kind could have been established between us but it was our misfortune that no anchorage could be found for the ships As all Indians are fond of beads it can scarcely be supposed that the pearls which the oysters at this place contained were overlooked by the natives and it is more than probable that if we could have continued here a few weeks we might have obtained some of great value in exchange for nails hatchets and billhooks upon which the natives with more reason set a much higher value We observed that in the lake or lagoon there were two or three very large vessels one of which had two masts and some cordage aloft to support them  To these two islands I gave the name of KING GEORGE's ISLANDS  in honour of his Majesty That which we last visited lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W the variation of the compass here was ° E  CHAP X  The Run from King George's Islands to the Islands of Saypan Tinian and Aguigan with an Account of several Islands that were discovered in that Track  WE pursued our course to the westward the same day  and the next about three o'clock in the afternoon we saw land again bearing S S W distant about six leagues We immediately stood for it and found it to be a low and very narrow island lying east and west we ran along the south side of it which had a green and pleasant appearance but a dreadful surf breaks upon every part of it with foul ground at some distance and many rocks and small islands scattered at about three leagues from the shore We found it about twenty leagues in length and it appeared to abound with inhabitants though we could get only a transient glance of them as we passed along To this place I gave the name of the PRINCE OF WALES's ISLAND  It lies in latitude ° S and the westermost end of it in longitude ° ′ W It is distant from King George's Islands about eight and forty leagues in the direction of S W the variation here was ° ′ E  From the western extremity of this island we steered N W and at noon on the th were in latitude ° ′ S  longitude ° ′ W the variation being ° ′ E The wind was now easterly and we had again the same mountainous swell from the southward that we had before we made the Islands of Direction and which from that time to  this day we had lost  when we lost that swell and for some days before we saw vast stocks of birds which we observed always took their flight to the southward when evening was coming on These appearances persuaded me that there was land in the same direction and I am of opinion that if the winds had not failed me in the higher latitudes I should have fallen in with it I would indeed at this time have hauled away to the southward and attempted the discovery if our people had been healthy for having observed that all the islands we had seen were full of inhabitants I was still more confirmed in my opinion as I could account for their being peopled only by supposing a chain of islands reaching to a continent but the sickness of the crews in both ships was an insuperable impediment  The next day  we again saw many birds of various sorts about the ship and therefore supposed that some other island was not far distant for the swell continuing I concluded that the land was not of very great extent I proceeded however with caution for the islands in this part of the ocean render the navigation very dangerous they being so low that a ship may be close in with them before they are seen We saw nothing  however on the th the th nor the th during which we continued to steer the same course though the birds still continued about the vessel in great numbers Our latitude was now ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W The Prince of Wales's Island was distant three hundred and thirteen leagues and the variation of the needle was ° ′ E  The next morning about seven o'clock we discovered a most dangerous reef of breakers bearing S S W and not farther distant than a single league In about half an hour afterwards land was seen from the masthead bearing W N W and distant about eight leagues it had the appearance of three islands with rocks and broken  ground between them  The south east side of these islands lies N E by N and S W by S and is about three leagues in length between the extream points from both which a reef runs out upon which the sea breaks to a tremendous height We sailed round the north end and upon the north west and west side saw innumerable rocks and shoals which stretched near two leagues into the sea and were extremely dangerous The islands themselves had a more fertile and beautiful appearance than any we had seen before and like the rest swarmed with people whose habitations we saw standing in clusters all along the coast We saw also a large vessel under sail at a little distance from the shore but to our unspeakable regret we were obliged to leave the place without farther examination for it was surrounded in every direction by rocks and breakers which rendered the hazard more than equivalent to every advantage we might procure At this time I took these for part of the islands called Solomon's Islands and was in hopes that I should fall in with others of them in some of which we might find an harbour  The reef of rocks which we first saw as we approached these islands lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W and it bears from Prince of Wales's Island N ° ′ W distant leagues The islands bear from the reef W NW distant nine leagues I called them the ISLANDS OF DANGER and steered from them N W by W allowing for the variation  After having seen the breakers soon after it was light in the morning I told my officers that I apprehended we should have frequent alarms in the night at night therefore every body was upon the watch which a very hard squall of wind with rain rendered the more necessary About nine o'clock having just gone down into my cabbin I heard a  great noise above  and when I enquired what was the matter I was told that the Tamar who was ahead had fired a gun and that our people saw breakers to leeward I ran instantly upon deck and soon perceived that what had been taken for breakers was nothing more than the undulating reflection of the moon which was going down and shone faintly from behind a cloud in the horizon we therefore bore away after the Tamar but did not get sight of her till an hour afterwards  Nothing worthy of notice happened till Monday the th  when about ten o'clock in the morning we discovered another island bearing S S W distant about seven or eight leagues we steered for it and found it to be low but covered with wood among which were cocoanut trees in great abundance It had a pleasant appearance and a large lake in the middle like King George's Island it is near thirty miles in circumference a dreadful sea breaks upon almost every part of the coast and a great deal of foul ground lies about it We sailed quite round it and when we were on the leeside sent out boats to sound in hopes of finding anchorage no soundings however were to be got near the shore but I sent the boats out a second time with orders to land if it were possible and procure some refreshments for the sick they landed with great difficulty and brought off about two hundred cocoanuts which to persons in our circumstances were an inestimable treasure The people who were on shore reported that there were no signs of its having ever been inhabited but that they found thousands of sea fowl sitting upon their nests which were built in high trees these birds were so tame that they suffered themselves to be knocked down without leaving their nests the ground was covered with land crabs but our people saw no other animal At first I was inclined to believe  that this island was the same that in the  Neptune François  is called  Maluita  and laid down about a degree to the eastward of the great island of Saint Elizabeth which is the principal of the Solomon's Islands but being afterwards convinced of the contrary I called it the DUKE of YORK's ISLAND  in honour of his late Royal Highness and I am of opinion that we were the first human beings who ever saw it There is indeed great reason to believe that there is no good authority for laying down Solomon's Islands in the situation that is assigned to them by the French the only person who has pretended to have seen them is Quiros and I doubt whether he left behind him any account of them by which they might be found by future navigators  We continued our course till the th  in the track of these islands and being then ten degrees to the westward of their situation in the chart without having seen any thing of them I hauled to the northward in order to cross the equinoxial and afterwards shape my course for the Ladrone Islands which though a long run I hoped to accomplish before I should be distressed for water notwithstanding it now began to fall short Our latitude this day was ° ′ S longitude ° ′ E and the variation was ° ′ E  On Tuesday the d of July  we again saw many birds about the ship and at four o'clock in the afternoon discovered an island bearing north and distant about six leagues we stood for it till sunset when it was distant about four leagues and then kept off and on for the night In the morning we found it a low flat island  of a most delightful appearance and full of wood among which the cocoanut tree was very conspicuous we saw however to our great regret much foul ground about it upon which the sea broke with a dreadful surf We steered along the  south west side of it  which we judged to be about four leagues in length and soon perceived not only that it was inhabited but very populous for presently after the ship came in sight we saw at least a thousand of the natives assembled upon the beach and in a very short time more than sixty canoes or rather proas put off from the shore and made towards us We lay by to receive them and they were very soon ranged in a circle round us These vessels were very neatly made and so clean that they appeared to be quite new none of them had fewer than three persons on board nor any of them more than six After these Indians had gazed at us some time one of them suddenly jumped out of his proa swam to the ship and ran up the side like a cat as soon as he had stepped over the gunwale he sat down upon it and burst into a violent fit of laughter then started up and ran all over the ship attempting to steal whatever he could lay his hands upon but without success for being stark naked it was impossible to conceal his booty for a moment Our seamen put him on a jacket and trowsers which produced great merriment for he had all the gestures of a monkey newly dressed we also gave him bread which he eat with a voracious appetite and after having played a thousand antic tricks he leaped overboard jacket and trowsers and all and swam back again to his proa after this several others swam to the ship ran up the side to the gunroom ports and having crept in snatched up whatever lay in their reach and immediately leaped again into the sea and swam away at a great rate though some of them having both hands full held up their arms quite out of the water to prevent their plunder from being spoiled These people are tall well proportioned and cleanlimbed their skin is a bright copper colour their features are extremely good and there is a mixture of intrepidity  and cheerfulness in their countenances that is very striking  They have long black hair which some of them wore tied up behind in a great bunch others in three knots some of them had long beards some only whiskers and some nothing more than a small tuft at the point of the chin They were all of them stark naked except their ornaments which consisted of shells very prettily disposed and strung together and were worn round their necks wrists and waists all their ears were bored but they had no ornaments in them when we saw them such ornaments as they wear when they wear any are probably very heavy for their ears hang down almost to their shoulders and some of them were quite split through One of these men who appeared to be a person of some consequence had a string of human teeth about his waist which was probably a trophy of his military prowess for he would not part with it in exchange for any thing that I could offer him Some of them were unarmed but others had one of the most dangerous weapons I had ever seen it was a kind of spear very broad at the end and stuck full of shark's teeth which are as sharp as a lancet at the sides for about three feet of its length We shewed them some cocoanuts and made signs that we wanted more but instead of giving any intimation that they could supply us they endeavoured to take away those we had  I sent out the boats to sound soon after we brought to off the island and when they came back they reported that there was ground at the depth of thirty fathom within two cables' length of the shore but as the bottom was coral rock and the soundings much too near the breakers for a ship to lie in safety I was obliged again to make sail without procuring any refreshments for the sick This island to which my officers gave the name of BYRON's ISLAND  lies in latitude  ° ′ S  longitude ° ′ E the variation of the compass here was one point E  In our course from this place we saw for several days abundance of fish but we could take only sharks which were become a good dish even at my own table Many of the people now began to fall down with fluxes which the Surgeon imputed to the excessive heat and almost perpetual rains  By the st  all our cocoanuts being expended our people began to fall down again with the scurvy The effect of these nuts alone in checking this disease is astonishing many whose limbs were become as black as ink who could not move without the assistance of two men and who besides total debility suffered excruciating pain were in a few days by eating these nuts although at sea so far recovered as to do their duty and could even go aloft as well as they did before the distemper seized them For several days about this time we had only faint breezes with smooth water so that we made but little way and as we were now not far from the Ladrone Islands where we hoped some refreshments might be procured we most ardently wished for a fresh gale especially as the heat was still intolerable the glass for a long time having never been lower than eightyone but often up to eightyfour and I am of opinion that this is the hottest the longest and most dangerous run that ever was made  On the th we were in latitude ° ′ N longitude ° ′ E  and on the d in latitude ° ′ N longitude ° ′ E during which time we had a northerly current Being now nearly in the latitude of Tinian I shaped my course for that island  CHAP XI  The Arrival of the Dolphin and Tamar at Tinian a Description of the present Condition of that Island and an Account of the Transactions there  ON the th  we saw a great number of birds about the ship which continued till the th when about two o'clock in the afternoon we saw land bearing W ½ N which proved to be the islands Saypan Tinian and Aiguigan At sunset the extremes of them bore from N W ½ N westward to S W and the three islands had the appearance of one At seven we hauled the wind and stood off and on all night and at six the next morning  the extremes of the islands which still made in one bore from N W by N to S W by S distant five leagues The east side of these islands lies N E by N and S W by S Saypan is the northermost and from the north east point of that island to the south west point of Aiguigan the distance is about seventeen leagues These three islands are between two and three leagues distant from each other Saypan is the largest and Aiguigan which is high and round the smallest We steered along the east side of them and at noon hauled round the south point of Tinian between that island and Aiguigan and anchored at the south west end of it in sixteen fathom water with a bottom of hard sand and coral rock opposite to a white sandy bay about a mile and a quarter from the shore and about three quarters of a mile from a reef of rocks that lies at a good distance from the shore in the very  spot where Lord Anson lay in the Centurion  The water at this place is so very clear that the bottom is plainly to be seen at the depth of four and twenty fathom which is no less than one hundred and fortyfour feet  As soon as the ship was secured I went on shore to six upon a place where tents might be erected for the sick which were now very numerous not a single man being wholly free from the scurvy and many in the last stage of it We found several huts which had been left by the Spaniards and Indians the year before for this year none of them had as yet been at the place nor was it probable that they should come for some months the sun being now almost vertical and the rainy season set in After I had fixed upon a spot for the tents six or seven of us endeavoured to push through the woods that we might come at the beautiful lawns and meadows of which there is so luxuriant a description in the Account of Lord Anson's Voyage and if possible kill some cattle The trees stood so thick and the place was so overgrown with underwood that we could not see three yards before us we therefore were obliged to keep continually hallooing to each other to prevent our being separately lost in this trackless wilderness As the weather was intolerably hot we had nothing on besides our shoes except our shirts and trowsers and these were in a very short time torn all to rags by the bushes and brambles at last however with incredible difficulty and labour we got through but to our great surprise and disappointment we found the country very different from the account we had read of it the lawns were entirely overgrown with a stubborn kind of reed or brush in many places higher than our heads and no where lower than our middles which continually entangled our legs and cut us like whipcord our  stockings perhaps might have suffered still more  but we wore none During this march we were also covered with flies from head to foot and whenever we offered to speak we were sure of having a mouthful many of which never failed to get down our throats After we had walked about three or four miles we got sight of a bull which we killed and a little before night got back to the beach as wet as if we had been dipt in water and so fatigued that we were scarcely able to stand We immediately sent out a party to fetch the bull and found that during our excursion some tents had been got up and the sick brought on shore  The next day our people were employed in setting up more tents getting the watercasks on shore  and clearing the well at which they were to be filled This well I imagined to be the same that the Centurion watered at but it was the worst that we had met with during the voyage for the water was not only brackish but full of worms The Road also where the ships lay was a dangerous situation at this season for the bottom is hard sand and large coral rocks and the anchor having no hold in the sand is in perpetual danger of being cut to pieces by the coral to prevent which as much as possible I rounded the cables and buoyed them up with empty water casks Another precaution also was taught me by experience for at first I moored but finding the cables much damaged I resolved to lie single for the future that by veering away or heaving in as we should have more or less wind we might always keep them from being slack and consequently from rubbing and this expedient succeeded to my wish At the full and change of the moon a prodigious swell tumbles in here so that I never saw ships at anchor roll so much as ours did while we lay here and it once drove in from the westward with such  violence and broke so high upon the reef that I was obliged to put to sea for a week for if our cable had parted in the night and the wind had been upon the shore which sometimes happens for two or three days together the ship must inevitably have been lost upon the rocks  As I was myself very ill with the scurvy I ordered a tent to be pitched for me and took up my residence on shore where we also erected the armourer's forge and began to repair the ironwork of both the ships I soon found that the island produced limes four oranges cocoanuts breadfruit  See a particular description of the breadfruit vol ii p  guavas and paupaus in great abundance but we found no watermelons scurvygrass or sorrel  Notwithstanding the fatigue and distress that we had endured and the various climates we had passed through neither of the ships had yet lost a single man since their sailing from England but while we lay here two died of fevers a disease with which many were seized though we all recovered very fast from the scurvy I am indeed of opinion that this is one of the most unhealthy spots in the world at least during the season in which we were here The rains were violent and almost incessant and the heat was so great as to threaten us with suffocation The thermometer which was kept on board the ship generally stood at eightysix which is but nine degrees less than the heat of the blood at the heart and if it had been on shore it would have risen much higher I had been upon the coast of Guinea in the West Indies and upon the island of Saint Thomas which is under the Line but I had never felt any such heat as I felt here Besides the inconvenience which we suffered from the weather we were incessantly tormented by the flies in the  day and by the musquitos in the night The island also swarms with centipieds and scorpions and a large black ant scarcely inferior to either in the malignity of its bite Besides these there were venomous insects without number altogether unknown to us by which many of us suffered so severely that we were afraid to lie down in our beds nor were those on board in a much better situation than those on shore for great numbers of these creatures being carried into the ship with the wood they took possession of every birth and left the poor seamen no place of rest either below or upon the deck  As soon as we were settled in our new habitations I sent out parties to discover the haunts of the cattle some of which were found but at a great distance from the tents and the beasts were so shy that it was very difficult to get a shot at them Some of the parties which when their haunts had been discovered were sent out to kill them were absent three days and nights before they could succeed and when a bullock had been dragged seven or eight miles through such woods and lawns as have just been described to the tents it was generally full of flyblows and stunk so as to be unfit for use nor was this the worst for the fatigue of the men in bringing down the carcass and the intolerable heat they suffered from the climate and the labour frequently brought on fevers which laid them up Poultry however we procured upon easier terms there was great plenty of birds and they were easily killed but the flesh of the best of them was very illtasted and such was the heat of the climate that within an hour after they were killed it was as green as grass and swarmed with maggots Our principal resource for fresh meat was the wild hog with which the island abounds These creatures are very fierce  and some of them so large that a carcass frequently weighed two hundred pounds We killed them without much difficulty but a Black belonging to the Tamar contrived a method to snare them so that we took great numbers of them alive which was an unspeakable advantage for it not only ensured our eating the flesh while it was sweet but enabled us to send a good number of them on board as seastores  In the mean time we were very desirous of procuring some beef in an eatable state with less risk and labour and Mr Gore one of our Mates at last discovered a pleasant spot upon the north west part of the island where cattle were in great plenty and whence they might be brought to the tents by sea To this place therefore I dispatched a party with a tent for their accommodation and sent the boats every day to fetch what they should kill sometimes however there broke such a sea upon the rocks that it was impossible to approach them and the Tamar's boat unhappily lost three of her best men by attempting it We were now upon the whole pretty well supplied with provisions especially as we baked fresh bread every day for the sick and the fatigue of our people being less there were fewer ill with the fever but several of them were so much disordered by eating of a very fine looking fish which we caught here that their recovery was for a long time doubtful The Author of the Account of Lord Anson's Voyage says that the people on board the Centurion thought it prudent to abstain from fish as the few which they caught at their first arrival surfeited those who eat of them But not attending sufficiently to this caution and too hastily taking the word  surfeit  in its literal and common acceptation we imagined that those who tasted the fish when Lord Anson first came hither were made sick merely by eating too much  whereas if that had been the case there would have been no reason for totally abstaining afterwards but only eating temperately We however bought our knowlege by experience which we might have had cheaper for though all our people who tasted this fish eat sparingly they were all soon afterwards dangerously ill  Besides the fruit that has been mentioned already this island produces cotton and indigo in abundance and would certainly be of great value if it was situated in the West Indies The Surgeon of the Tamar enclosed a large spot of ground here and made a very pretty garden but we did not stay long enough to derive any advantage from it  While we  ay here I sent the Tamar to examine the island of Saypan which is much larger than Tinian rises higher and in my opinion has a much pleasanter appearance She anchored to the leeward of it at the distance of a mile from the shore and in about ten fathom water with much the same kind of ground as we had in the road of Tinian Her people landed upon a fine sandy beach which is six or seven miles long and walked up into the woods where they saw many trees which were very fit for topmasts They saw no fowls nor any tracks of cattle but of hogs and guanicoes there was plenty They found no fresh water near the beach but saw a large pond inland which they did not examine They saw large heaps of pearl oystershells thrown up together and other signs of people having been there not long before possibly the Spaniards may go thither at some seasons of the year and carry on a pearl fishery They also saw many of those square pyramidal pillars which are to be found at Tinian and which are particularly described in the Account of Lord Anson's Voyage  On Monday the th of September  having now been here nine weeks and our sick being pretty well recovered I ordered the tents to be struck and with the forge and oven carried back to the ship I also laid in about two thousand cocoanuts  which I had experienced to be so powerful a remedy for the scurvy and the next day I weighed hoping that before we should get the length of the Bashe Islands the N E monsoon would be set in I stood along the shore to take in the beefhunters  but we had very little wind this day and the next till the evening  when it came to the westward and blew fresh I then stood to the northward till the morning of the d when we made Anatacan an island that is remarkable high and the same that was first fallen in with by Lord Anson  CHAP XIII  The Run from Tinian to Pulo Timoan with some Account of that Island its Inhabitants and Productions and thence to Batavia  WE continued our course till Thursday the th  when being in latitude ° ′ N longitude ° ′ E we found the ship two and twenty miles to the southward of her account which must have been the effect of a strong current in that direction The variation here was ° ′ E and for some time we found it regularly decreasing so that on the th being in latitude ° ′ N longitude ° ′ E the needle pointed due north  On the th  we had found the ship eighteen miles to the northward of her account and saw several land birds about the ship which appeared to be very much tired we caught one as it was resting upon the booms and found it very remarkable It was about as big as a goose and all over as white as snow except the legs and beak which were black the beak was curved and of so great a length and thickness that it is not easy to conceive how the muscles of the neck which was about a foot long and as small as that of a crane could support it We kept it about four months upon biscuit and water but it then died apparently for want of nourishment being almost as light as a bladder It was very different from every species of the Toucan that is represented by Edwards and I believe has never been described  These birds appeared to have been blown off some island to the northward of us  that is not laid down in the charts  The needle continued to point due north till the d  when at six o'clock in the morning Grafton's Island the northermost of the Bashé Islands bore south distant six leagues As I had designed to touch at these islands I stood for that in sight but as the navigation from hence to the Streight of Banca is very dangerous and we had now both a fine morning and a fine gale I thought it best to proceed on our way and therefore steered westward again The principal of these islands are five in number and by a good observation Grafton's Island lies in latitude ° ′ N longitude ° ′ E The variation of the compass was now ° ′ W  On the th  being in latitude ° ′ N longitude ° ′ E we kept a good lookout for the Triangles which lie without the north end of the Prasil and form a most dangerous shoal On the th  we saw several trees and large bamboos floating about the ship and upon sounding had three and twenty fathom with dark brown sand and small pieces of shells Our latitude was now ° ′ N longitude ° ′ E  the variation was ′ W The next day we found the ship thirteen miles to the northward of her account which we judged to be the effect of a current and on the d of November  we found her thirtyeight miles to the southward of her account Our latitude by observation was ° ′ N longitude ° ′ E We had here soundings at fortytwo and fortythree fathom with soft mud  At seven o'clock the next morning  we saw the island of Timoan bearing S W by W distant about twelve leagues As Dampier has mentioned Pulo Timoan as a place where  some refreshments are to be procured  I endeavoured to touch there having lived upon salt provisions which were now become bad ever since we were at Tinian but light airs calms and a southerly current prevented our coming to an anchor till late in the evening of the th  We had sixteen fathom at about the distance of two miles from the shore in a bay on the east side of the island  The next day I landed to see what was to be got  and found the inhabitants who are Malays a surly insolent set of people As soon as they saw us approaching the shore they came down to the beach in great numbers having a long knife in one hand a spear headed with iron in the other and a cressit or dagger by their side We went on shore however notwithstanding these hostile appearances and a treaty soon commenced between us but all we could procure was about a dozen of fowls and a goat and kid We had offered them knives hatchets bill hooks and other things of the same kind but these they refused with great contempt and demanded rupees as we had no rupees we were at first much at a loss how to pay for our purchase but at last we bethought ourselves of some pocket handkerchiefs and these they vouchsafed to accept though they would take only the best  These people are of a small stature but extremely well made and of a dark copper colour We saw among them one old man who was dressed somewhat in the manner of the Persians but all the rest were naked except a handkerchief which they wore as a kind of turban upon their heads and some pieces of cloth which were fastened with a silver plate or clasp round their middles We saw none of their women and probably some care was taken to keep them out of our fight The habitations are very neatly  built of slit bamboo  and are raised upon posts about eight feet from the ground Their boats are also well made and we saw some of a large size in which we supposed that they carried on a trade to Malacca  The island is mountainous and woody but we found it pleasant when we were ashore it produces the cabbage and cocoanut tree in great plenty but the natives did not chuse to let us have any of the fruit We saw also some rice grounds but what other vegetable productions Nature has favoured them with we had no opportunity to learn as we staid here but two nights and one day In the bay where the ship rode there is excellent fishing though the surf runs very high we hauled our seine with great success but could easily perceive that it gave umbrage to the inhabitants who consider all the fish about these islands as their own There are two fine rivers that run into this bay and the water is excellent it was indeed so much better than what we had on board that I filled as many casks with it as loaded the boat twice While we lay here some of the natives brought down an animal which had the body of a hare and the legs of a deer one of our officers bought it and we should have been glad to have kept it alive but it was impossible for us to procure for it such food as it would eat it was therefore killed and we found it very good food All the while we lay here we had the most violent thunder lightning and rain that I had ever known and finding that nothing more was to be procured we sailed again on Thursday morning  with a fine breeze off the land In the afternoon we tried the current and found it set S E at the rate of a mile an hour The variation here was ′ W We certainly made this passage at an improper season of the year for after we came into the latitude of Pulo Condore  we had nothing but light airs calms and tornados with violent rain thunder and lightning  At seven o'clock in the morning of Sunday the th  we saw the east end of the island of Lingen bearing S W by W distant eleven or twelve leagues The current set E S E at the rate of a mile an hour At noon it fell calm and I anchored with the kedge in twenty fathom At one o'clock the weather having cleared up we saw a small island bearing S W ½ S distant ten or eleven leagues  At one o'clock the next morning  we weighed and made sail and at six the small island bore W S W distant about seven leagues and some very small islands which we supposed to be Domines islands W ½ N distant about seven or eight leagues a remarkable double peak on the island of Lingen bearing at same time W by N distant about ten or twelve leagues Our latitude by observation was now ′ S The latitude of the east end of Lingen is ′ S longitude ° ′ E Pulo Taya beard from it nearly S by W and is distant about twelve leagues  At ten o'clock in the morning of Tuesday the th  we saw a small Chinese junk to the north east and at seven the next morning a small island called Pulo Toté bearing S E by E distant about twelve leagues A little to the northward of Pulo Taya is a very small island called Pulo Toupon  The next day at four in the afternoon  there being no wind we came to an anchor in fourteen fathom with soft ground Pulo Taya bearing N W distant about seven leagues We tried the current and found it set by E by S at the rate of two knots two fathom an hour We saw a sloop at anchor about four miles from us which hoisted Dutch  colours  In the night we had violent rain with hard squalls during one of which we parted the stream cable and therefore let go the small bower At eight in the morning  the wind became moderate and variable from N N W to W S W We got out our longboat and weighed the stream anchor and at nine made sail We found the current still very strong to the eastward and at two we anchored again in fourteen fathom Pulo Taya bearing NW ½ N distant between seven and eight leagues The vessel which we had seen the day before under Dutch colours still lying at anchor in the same place I sent a boat with an officer to speak with her the officer was received on board with great civility but was extremely surprised to find that he could not make himself understood for the people on board were Malays without a single white man among them they made tea for our men immediately and behaved with great chearfulness and hospitality The vessel was of a very singular construction her deck was of slit bamboo and she was steered not by a rudder but by two large pieces of timber one upon each quarter  The next morning  at six o'clock we weighed and made sail at two Monopin Hill bore S by E distant about ten or eleven leagues and had the appearance of a small island It bears S by W from the seven islands and is distant from them about twelve leagues its latitude is ° South From the seven islands we steered S W by S and had regular soundings from twelve to seven fathom and soon after saw the coast of Sumatra bearing from W S W to W by N at the distance of about seven leagues In the evening  we anchored in seven fathom and the next morning at four we made sail again and continued our course S by E till the peak of Monopin Hill bore east and Batacarang  Point on the Sumatra shore S W to avoid a shoal  called Frederick Hendrick which is about midway between the Banca and Sumatra shore the soundings were thirteen and fourteen fathom We then steered E S E and kept midchannel to avoid the banks of Palambam River and that which lies off the westermost point of Banca When we were abreast of Palambam River we regularly shoaled our water from fourteen to seven fathom and when we had passed it we deepened it again to fifteen and sixteen fathom We continued to steer E S E between the Third and Fourth Points of Sumatra which are about ten leagues distant from each other the soundings nearest to the Sumatra shore were all along from eleven to thirteen fathom and the high land of Queda Banca appeared over the Third Point of Sumatra bearing E S E From the Third Point to the Second the course is S E by S at the distance of about eleven or twelve leagues The high land of Queda Banca and the Second Point of Sumatra bear E N E and W S W of each other The Streight is about five leagues over and in the midchannel there is twentyfour fathom At six o'clock in the evening we anchored in thirteen fathom Monopin Hill bearing N ½ W and the Third Point of Sumatra S E by E distant between two and three leagues Many small vessels were in sight and most of them hoisted Dutch colours In the night we had fresh gales and squalls with thunder and lightning and hard rain but as our cables were good we were in no danger for in this place the anchor is buried in a stiff clay  In the morning the current or tide set to the S E at the rate of three knots at five we weighed  with a moderate gale at west and hazey weather and in the night the tide shifted and ran as strongly to the N W so that it ebbs and flows here twelve hours  On the th  we spoke with an English snow belonging to the East India Company which was bound from Bencoolen to Malacca and Bengal We had now nothing to eat but the ship's provisions which were become very bad for all our beef and pork stunk intolerably and our bread was rotten and full of worms but as soon as the Master of this snow learnt our situation he generously sent me a sheep a dozen fowls and a turtle which I verily believe was half his stock besides two gallons of arrack and would accept nothing but our thanks in return It is with great pleasure that I pay this tribute to his liberality and am very sorry that I cannot recollect his name or the name of his vessel In the afternoon we worked round the First Point of Sumatra and our soundings on the northside at the distance of about a mile and a half from the shore were fourteen fathom At half an hour after three we anchored and sent a boat to sound for the shoals which lie to the northward of the island called Lasipara which bore from us S E by S distant about six leagues Little wind and a strong tide of flood to the northward prevented our working between these shoals and the coast of Sumatra till the afternoon of the twentieth  the soundings were very regular being nine or ten fathom as we stood over to the island and five or six when we stood over to Sumatra As this Streight has been often navigated and is well known it is not necessary to insert all the particulars of our passage through it I shall therefore only say that at six o'clock in the evening of Tuesday the th  we steered between the islands Edam and Horn and entered the road of Batavia At eight we anchored without the ships Onrust bearing W N W distant five or six miles  CHAP XIII  Transactions at Batavia and Departure from that Place  THE next day which by our account was the th  but by the account of the Dutch at this place was the th we having lost a day by having steered westward a year we anchored nearer to the town and saluted the water fort with eleven guns which were returned We found here above a hundred sail great and small and among others a large English ship belonging to Bombay which saluted us with thirteen guns  There is always lying here a Dutch Commodore belonging to the Company who among his countrymen is a person of very great consequence This gentleman thought fit to send his boat on board of me with only the cockswain in her who was a very dirty ragged fellow as soon as he was brought to me he asked whence I came whither I was bound and many other questions which I thought equally impertinent at the same time pulling out a book and pen and ink that he might set down the answers but as I was impatient to save him this trouble he was desired immediately to walk over the ship's side and put off his boat with which he was graciously pleased to comply  When we came to this place we had not one man sick in either of the ships but as I knew it to be more unhealthy than any other part of the East Indies as the rainy season was at hand and arrack was to be procured in great plenty I determined to make my stay here as short as possible I went on shore to wait upon the Dutch Governor but was  told that he was at his country house about four miles distant from the town I met however with an officer called a shebander who is a kind of master of the ceremonies and he acquainted me that if I chose to go to the Governor immediately rather than wait for his coming to town he would attend me I accepted his offer and we set out together in his chariot The Governor received me with great politeness and told me that I might either take a house in any part of the city that I should like or be provided with lodgings at the hotel This hotel is a licensed lodginghouse the only one in the place and kept by a Frenchman an artful fellow who is put in by the Governor himself It has indeed more the appearance of a palace than a house of entertainment being the most magnificent building in Batavia nor would a small edifice answer the purpose for as there is a penalty of five hundred dollars upon any person in the city who shall suffer a stranger to sleep a single night at his house the strangers who make it their residence are never few all the houses indeed have a stately appearance on the outside and are elegantly fitted up within and we were told that the Chinese of whom there are great numbers at this place were the architects The city is large and the streets well laid out but they have greatly the appearance of those in the cities of Holland for a canal runs through most of them with a row of trees planted on each side this is convenient for the merchants who have every thing brought up to their own doors by water but it probably contributes to the unhealthiness of the place the canal indeed as the city is built in a swamp might be necessary as a drain but the trees though they have a pleasant appearance must certainly prevent the noxious vapours that are perpetually arising from being dispersed by obstructing the circulation of the air  The number of people here is incredible and they are of almost every nation in the world Dutch Portuguese Chinese Persians Moors Malays Javanese and many others the Chinese however have a large town to themselves without the walls and carry on a considerable trade for they have annually ten or twelve large junks from China and to these the opulence of the Dutch at Batavia is in a great measure owing The beef here is bad and the mutton scarce but the poultry and fish are excellent and in great plenty Here are also the greatest variety and abundance of the finest fruit in the world but the musquitos centipieds scorpions and other noxious vermin which are innumerable prevent all enjoyment and even rest as well by night as by day The roads for many miles about the city are as good as any in England they are very broad and by the side of them runs a canal shaded by tall trees which is navigable for vessels of a very large size on the other side of the canal are gardens of a very pleasant appearance and country houses of the citizens where they spend as much of their time as possible the situation being less unwholesome than the city and there are so few of them who do not keep a carriage that it is almost a disgrace to be seen on foot  At this place I continued from the th of November to the th of December when  having procured what refreshments I could for my people and taken on board a sufficient quantity of rice and arrack to serve for the rest of the voyage I weighed anchor and made sail The fort saluted me with eleven guns and the Dutch Commodore with thirteen which I returned we were saluted also by the English ship We worked down to Prince's Island in the Streight of Sunda and came to an anchor there on the th  In this passage the boats came off to us from the Java shore and supplied us with turtle in such plenty that neither of the  ships' companies eat any thing else  We lay at Prince's Island till the th and during all that time we subsisted wholly upon the same food which was procured from the inhabitants at a very reasonable rate Having now taken on board as much wood and water as we could stow we weighed and got without Java Head before night but by this time a dangerous putrid fever had broken out among us three of my people had died and many others now lay in so dangerous a condition that there were little hopes of their recovery we did not however bury one at Batavia which notwithstanding our stay was so short was thought to be a very extraordinary instance of good fortune and our sick gradually recovered after we had been a week or two at sea  CHAP XIV  The Passage from Batavia to the Cape of Good Hope and from thence to England  WE continued our course  without any event worthy of notice except that one of my best men unhappily fell overboard and was drowned till Monday the th of February  when at six o'clock in the morning we saw the coast of Africa bearing from N N W to N E distant about seven leagues it made in several high hills and white sandy cliffs and its latitude was ° ′ S longitude ° ′ E the variation here was ° W and our depth of water fiftythree fathom with a bottom of coarse brown sand  I stood in for the land and when I was within about two leagues of it I saw a great smoke rising from a sandy beach I imagined the smoke to be made by the Hottentots yet I was astonished at their chusing this part of the coast for their residence for it consisted of nothing but sand banks as far as we could see without the least bush or a single blade of verdure and so heavy a sea broke upon the coast that it was impossible to catch any fish  On Wednesday the th at three o'clock in the afternoon  we were abreast of Cape Lagullas from which the coast lies W N W to the Cape of Good Hope which is distant about thirty leagues The next day  we passed between Penguin  Island and Green Point  and worked into Table Bay with our topsails close reefed there being a strong gale with hard squalls at S S E At three o'clock in the afternoon we anchored and saluted the fort which was returned The Dutch told me that none of their ships could have worked in in such a gale of wind and that we seemed to come in faster than they were generally able to do when the wind was fair  The next morning  I waited upon the Governor who had sent his coach and six to the waterside for me He is an old man but is a favourite with all ranks of people he received me with the greatest politeness and not only offered me the Company's house in the garden for my residence while I should continue at the Cape but his coach whenever I should think fit to use it As I was one day at dinner with him and some other gentlemen I took occasion to mention the smoke that I had seen upon one of the sandy beaches on a desolate part of the coast and the surprise with which it had struck me they then told me that another ship some time before had fallen in with that part of the coast and had seen large smokes as I had done although the place was uninhabited and supposed to be an island to account for the smokes however they told me also that two Dutch East Indiamen had about two years before sailed from Batavia for the Cape and had never afterwards been heard of and it was supposed that one or both of them had been shipwrecked there and that the smokes which had been seen were made by some of the unfortunate crew they added that they had more than once sent out vessels to look for them but that there broke so dreadful a sea upon the coast they were obliged to return without attempting to go on  shore When I heard this melancholy account I could only regret that I had not known it before for I would then certainly have made every effort in my power to have found these unhappy wretches and taken them from a place where now in all probability they must miserably perish  The Cape is certainly a most excellent place for ships to touch at it is a healthy climate a fine country and abounds with refreshments of every kind The Company's garden is a delightful spot and at the end of it there is a paddock belonging to the Governor in which are kept a great number of rare and curious animals and among others when I was there were three fine ostriches and four zebras of an uncommon size I gave all the people leave to go on shore by turns and they always contrived to get very drunk with Cape wine before they came back Many ships came in while we lay here some were Dutch some French some Danes but all were outward bound  Having continued here three weeks and during that time refreshed our men and completed our water I took leave of the good old Governor on the th of March and on the th  sailed out of the bay with a fine breeze at S E  On Sunday the th at six in the morning  we saw the island of Saint Helena bearing W by N at the distance of about sixteen leagues and about noon a large ship which shewed French colours We pursued our course and a few days afterwards as we were sailing with a fine gale and at a great distance from land the ship suddenly received a rude shock as if she had struck the ground this instantly brought all who were below upon the deck in great consternation and upon looking out we saw the water to a very large extent tinged with blood this put an end to our  fears  and we concluded that we must have struck either a whale or a grampus from which the ship was not likely to receive much damage nor in fact did she receive any About this time also we had the misfortune to bury our carpenter's mate a very ingenious and diligent young man who had never been well after our leaving Batavia  On the th  we crossed the equator in longitude ° ′ W and the next morning Captain Cumming came on board and informed me that the Tamar's three lower rudder braces on the stern were broken off which rendered the rudder unserviceable I immediately sent the carpenter on board who found the condition of the braces even worse than had been reported so that the rudder could not possibly be new hung he therefore went to work upon a machine like that which had been fixed to the Ipswich and by which she was steered home this machine in about five days he completed and with some little alterations of his own it was an excellent piece of work The Tamar steered very well with it but thinking that it might not be sufficient to secure her in bad weather or upon a lee shore Lordered Captain Cumming to run down to Antigua that he might there heave the ship down and get the rudder new hung with a fresh set of braces which he had with him for that purpose for the braces with which the ship went out being of iron were not expected to last as long as our's the lower ones with the sheathing being of copper  Pursuant to these orders the Tamar parted company with us on the st of April  and steered for the Caribbee Islands When we came into latitude ° N longitude ° W we had strong gales from W S W to W N W with a great sea which broke over us continually for six days successively and  run us into latitude ° N longitude ° W  On the th of May at seven o'clock in the morning we made the Islands of Scilly having been just nine weeks coming from the Cape of Good Hope and somewhat more than two and twenty months upon the voyage the th  the ship came to anchor in the Downs and on the same day I landed at Deal and set out for London  AN ACCOUNT OF A VOYAGE round the WORLD IN THE YEARS MDCCLXVI MDCCLXVII and MDCCLXVIII By SAMUEL WALLIS  Esq  Commander of his Majesty's Ship the DOLPHIN  CHAP I  The Passage to the coast of Patagonia with some account of the Natives  The longitude in this voyage is reckoned from the meridian of London  HAVING received my commission which was dated the th of June  I went on board the same day hoisted the pendant and began to enter seamen but according to my orders took no boys either for myself or any of the officers  The ship was fitted for the sea with all possible expedition during which the articles of war and the act of parliament were read to the ship's company  on the th of July we sailed down the river and on the th of August  at eight o'clock in the morning anchored in Plymouth Sound  On the th I received my sailing orders  with directions to take the Swallow sloop and the Prince Frederick storeship under my command and this day I took on board among other things three thousand weight of portable soup and a bale of cork jackets Every part of the ship was filled with stores and necessaries of various kinds even to the steerage and stateroom which were allotted to the slops and portable soup The surgeon offered to purchase an extraordinary quantity of medicines and medical necessaries which as the ship's company might become sickly  he said would in that case be of great service if room could be found to flow them in I therefore gave him leave to put them into my cabbin the only place in the ship where they could be received as they consisted of three large boxes  On the d  at four o'clock in the morning I weighed and made sail in company with the Swallow and Prince Frederick and had soon the mortification to find that the Swallow was a very bad sailer  We proceeded in our voyage without any remarkable incident till Sunday the seventh of September  when about eight o'clock in the morning we saw the island of Porto Santo bearing west and about noon saw the eastend of the island of Madeira  About five o'clock we ran between this end of the island and the Deserters On the side next the Deserters is a low flat island and near it a needle rock the side next to Madeira is full of broken rocks and for that reason it is not safe to come within less than two miles of it  At six in the evening we anchored in Madeira Road about twothirds of a mile from the shore in fathom with a muddy bottom about eight the Swallow and Prince Frederick also came to an anchor and I sent an officer on shore to the Governor to let him know that I would salute him if he would return an equal number of guns which he promised to do  the next morning therefore at six o'clock I saluted him with thirteen guns and he returned thirteen as he had promised  Having taken in a proper quantity of water at this place with four pipes and ten puncheons of wine some fresh beef and a large quantity of onions we weighed anchor on the th  and continued our voyage  At six o'clock in the morning of Tuesday the th  we saw the island of Palma and found the ship miles to the southward of her reckoning As we were sailing along this island at the rate of no less than eight miles an hour with the wind at east it died away at once so that within less than two minutes the ship had no motion though we were at least four leagues distant from the shore Palma lies in lat ° ′ N long ° ′ W  On the th we tried the current  and found it set S W by W one mile an hour this day we saw two herons flying to the eastward and a great number of bonettos about the ship of which we caught eight  In the night between the st and d we lost our companion the Swallow  and about eight in the morning we saw the island of Sal bearing S ½ W at noon it bore S ¾ W distant leagues and at noon on the d  the nearest land of the island of Bonavista bore from S to W S W distant seven or eight miles the eastend at the same time bearing W distant two leagues In this situation we sounded and had only fathom with rocky ground at the same time we saw a very great rippling which we supposed to be caused by a reef stretching off the point about E S E three miles and breakers without us distant also about three miles in the direction of S E We steered between the rippling and the breakers but after hauling the ship off about half a mile we had no soundings The Prince Frederick passed very near the breakers in the S E but had no soundings yet these breakers are supposed to be dangerous The middle of the isle of Sal is in lat ° ′ N long ° ′ W the middle of Bonavista is in lat ° ′ long ° W  On the next day  at six in the morning the isle of May bore from W to S W six leagues and soon after the Swallow again joined company At half an hour after the westend of the isle of May bore north at the distance of five miles and we found a current here setting to the southward at the rate of twenty miles in four and twenty hours The latitude of this island is ° ′ N longitude ° ′ W  At noon the southend of the island St Iago bore S W by W distant four leagues and the northend N W distant five leagues At half an hour after three we anchored in Port Praya in that island in company with the Swallow and Prince Frederick in eight fathom water upon sandy ground We had much rain and lightning in the night and early in the morning I sent to the commandingofficer at the fort  for leave to get off some water and other refreshments which he granted  We soon learnt that this was the sickly season and that the rains were so great as to render it extremely difficult to get any thing down from the country to the ships it happened also unfortunately that the smallpox which is extremely fatal here was at this time epidemic so that I permitted no man to go ashore who had not had that distemper and I would not suffer even those that had to go into any house  We procured however a supply of water and some cattle from the shore and caught abundance of fish with the seine which was hauled twice every day we found also in the valley where we got our water a kind of large purslain growing wild in amazing quantities this was a most welcome refreshment both raw as a sallad and boiled with the  broth and pease and when we left the place we carried away enough of it to serve us a week  On the th  at half an hour after twelve we weighed and put to sea at half an hour after six in the evening the peak of Fuego bore W N W distant leagues and in the night the burning mountain was very visible  This day I ordered hooks and lines to be served to all the ship's company that they might catch fish for themselves but at the same time I also ordered that no man should keep his fish more than four and twenty hours before it was eaten for I had observed that stale and even dried fish had made the people sickly and tainted the air in the ship  On the first of October  in lat ° ′ N we lost the true tradewind and had only light and variable gales and this day we found that the ship was set twelve miles to the northward by a current  on the third we found a current run S by E at the rate of six fathom an hour or about twenty miles and a half a day  on the seventh we found the ship miles to the southward of her reckoning  On the th our butter and cheese being all expended  we began to serve the ship's company with oil and I gave orders that they should also be served with mustard and vinegar once a fortnight during the rest of the voyage  On the d we saw an incredible number of birds  and among the rest a man of war bird which inclined us to think that some land was not more than leagues distant this day we crossed the equator in longitude ° ′ W  On the th I ordered the ship's company to be served with brandy and reserved the wine for the sick and convalescent  On the th the Prince Frederick made signals of distress  upon which we bore down to her and found that she had  carried away her foretopsailyard To supply this loss we gave her our spritsailtopsailyard which we could spare and she hoisted it immediately  On the th she again made signals of distress  upon which I brought to and sent the carpenter on board her who returned with an account that she had sprung a leak under the larboard cheek forward and that it was impossible to do any thing to it till we had better weather Upon speaking with Lieutenant Brine who commanded her he informed me that his crew were sickly that the fatigue of working the pumps and constantly standing by the sails had worn them down that their provisions were not good that they had nothing to drink but water and that he feared it would be impossible for him to keep company with me except I could spare him some assistance For the badness of their provision I had no remedy but I sent on board a carpenter and six seamen to assist in pumping and working the ship  On the eighth of November  being in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ we sounded with fathom but had no ground on the ninth having seen a great number of birds called albatrosses we sounded again with fathom but had no ground  On the th  having by signal brought the storeship under our stern I sent the carpenter with proper assistants on board to stop the leak but they found that very little could be done we then compleated our provisions and those of the Swallow from her stores and put on board her all our staves iron hoops and empty oil jars The next day I sent a carpenter and six seamen to relieve the men that had been sent to assist her on the th of October who by this time began to suffer much by their fatigue Several of her crew having the appearance of the scurvy I sent  the surgeon on board her with some medicines for the sick This day having seen some albatrosses turtles and weeds we sounded but had no ground with fathom  On the th being now in latitude south  we began to find it very cold we therefore got up our quarter cloths and fitted them to their proper places and the seamen put on their thick jackets This day we saw a turtle and several albatrosses but still had no ground with fathom  We continued to see weeds and birds on board the ship but had no ground till the th  when we found a soft muddy bottom at the depth of fathom We were now in lat ° ′ S long ° ′ W and this was the first sounding we had after our coming upon the coast of Brazil  On the th about eight o'clock in the evening  we saw a meteor of a very extraordinary appearance in the northeast which soon after we had observed it flew off in a horizontal line to the southwest with amazing rapidity it was near a minute in its progress and it left a train of light behind it so strong that the deck was not less illuminated than at noonday This day we saw a great number of seals about the ship and had soundings at fathom with a muddy bottom The next day the seals continued  and we had soundings at fathom with a dark coloured sand upon which we bent our cables  On the st we had no ground with fathom  Our lat at noon was ° ′ S long ° ′ W  On the d we had soundings again at fathom  with a dark brown sand and saw many whales and seals about the ship with a great number of butterflies and birds among which were snipes and plover Our lat at noon was ° ′ long ° ′ W  Our soundings continued from to fathom till the eighth of December  when about six o'clock in the morning we saw land bearing from S W to W by S and appearing like many small islands At noon it bore from W by S to S S W distant leagues our latitude then being ° ′ S long ° ′ W About three o'clock Cape  Blanco  bore W N W distant six leagues and a remarkable double saddle W S W distant about three leagues We had now soundings from to fathom sometimes with coarse sand and gravel sometimes with small black stones and shells At eight in the evening the Tower rock at Port Desire bore S W by W distant about three leagues and the extreams of the land from S by E to N W by N At nine Penguin Island bore S W by W ½ W distant two leagues and at four o'clock in the morning of the ninth  the land seen from the masthead bore from S W to W by N  At noon Penguin island bore S by E distant miles our latitude being ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W This day we saw such a quantity of red shrimps about the ship that the sea was coloured with them  At noon the next day Wednesday the th  the extreams of the land bore from S W to N W and Wood's Mount near the entrance of Saint Julian's bore S W by W distant three or four leagues Our latitude was ° ′ S our longitude ° ′ W and our soundings were from to fathom sometimes fine sand sometimes soft mud  At noon on Thursday the th  Penguin island bore N N E distant leagues Our latitude was ° ′ S our longitude ° ′ W  We continued our course till Saturday the th  when our latitude being ° ′ S and our longitude ° ′ W  the extreams of the land bore from N ½ to S S W ½ W and the ship was about five or six miles distant from the shore Cape Beachyhead the northermost cape was found to lie in latitude ° ′ S and Cape Fairweather the southermost cape in latitude ° ′ S  On Sunday the th at four in the morning  Cape Beachyhead bore N W ½ N distant about eight leagues and at noon our latitude being ° ′ S and longitude ° ′ W Penguin island bore N ° E distant leagues We were six leagues from the shore and the extreams of the land were from N W to W S W  At eight o'clock in the morning of Monday the th  being about six miles from the shore the extreams of the land bore from S by E to N by E and the entrance of the river Saint Croix S W ½ W We had fathom quite cross the opening the distance from point to point being about seven miles and afterwards keeping at the distance of about four miles from each cape we had from to fathom The land on the north shore is high and appears in three capes that on the south shore is low and flat At seven in the evening Cape Fairweather bore S W ½ S distant about four leagues a low point running out from it S S W ¾ W We stood off and on all night and had from to fathom water with a bottom of sand and mud At seven the next morning Tuesday the th  we shoaled gradually into fathom with a bottom of fine sand and soon after into six we then hauled off S E by S somewhat more than a mile then steered east five miles then E by N and deepened into fathom Cape Fairweather at this time bore W ½ S distant four leagues and the northermost extremity of the land W N W When we first came into shoal water Cape Fairweather bore W ½ N and a low point without it W S W  distant about four miles At noon Cape Fairweather bore W N W ½ W distant six leagues and a large hummock S W ½ W distant seven leagues At this time our lat was ° ′ S long ° W  At one o'clock being about two leagues distant from the shore the extreams of three remarkable round hills bore from S W by W to W S W At four Cape Virgin Mary bore S E by S distant about four leagues At eight we were very near the Cape and upon the point of it saw several men riding who made signs for us to come on shore In about half an hour we anchored in a bay close under the south side of the Cape in ten fathom water with a gravelly bottom The Swallow and storeship anchored soon after between us and the Cape which then bore N by W ½ W and a low sandy point like Dungeness S by W From the Cape there runs a shoal to the distance of about half a league which may be easily known by the weeds that are upon it We found it high water at half an hour after eleven and the tide rose twenty foot  The natives continued abreast of the ship all night making several great fires and frequently shouting very loud As soon as it was light  on Wednesday morning the th we saw great numbers of them in motion who made signs for us to land About five o'clock I made the signal for the boats belonging to the Swallow and the Prince Frederick to come on board and in the mean time hoisted out our own These boats being all manned and armed I took a party of marines and rowed towards the shore having left orders with the master to bring the ship's broadside to bear upon the landing place and to keep the guns loaded with round shot We reached the beach about six o'clock and before we went from the boat I made signs to the natives to retire  to some distance they immediately complied  and I then landed with the captain of the Swallow and several of the officers the marines were drawn up and the boats were brought to a grappling near the shore I then made signs to the natives to come near and directed them to sit down in a semicircle which they did with great order and chearfulness When this was done I distributed among them several knives scissars buttons beads combs and other toys particularly some ribands to the women which they received with a very becoming mixture of pleasure and respect Having distributed my presents I endeavoured to make them understand that I had other things which I would part with but for which I expected somewhat in return I shewed them some hatchets and billhooks and pointed to some guanicoes which happened to be near and some ostriches which I saw dead among them making signs at the same time that I wanted to eat but they either could not or would not understand me for though they seemed very desirous of the hatchets and the billhooks they did not give the least intimation that they would part with any provisions no traffick therefore was carried on between us  Each of these people both men and women had a horse with a decent saddle stirrups and bridle The men had wooden spurs except one who had a large pair of such as are worn in Spain brass stirrups and a Spanish cimeter without a scabbard but notwithstanding these distinctions he did not appear to have any authority over the rest the women had no spurs The horses appeared to be well made and nimble and were about hands high The people had also many dogs with them which as well as the horses appeared to be of a Spanish breed  As I had two measuring rods with me  we went round and measured those that appeared to be tallest among them One of these was six feet seven inches high several more were six feet five and six feet six inches but the stature of the greater part of them was from five feet ten to six feet Their complexion is a dark copper colour like that of the Indians in North America their hair is strait and nearly as harsh as hog's bristles it is tied back with a cotton string but neither sex wears any headdress They are well made robust and boney but their hands and feet are remarkably small They are cloathed with the skins of the guanico sewed together into pieces about six foot long and five wide these are wrapped round the body and fastened with a girdle with the hairy side inwards some of them had also what the Spaniards have called a  puncho  a square piece of cloth made of the downy hair of the guanico through which a hole being cut for the head the rest hangs round them about as low as the knee The guanico is an animal that in size make and colour resembles a deer but it has a hump on its back and no horns These people wear also a kind of drawers which they pull up very tight and buskins which reach from the midleg to the instep before and behind are brought under the heel the rest of the foot is without any covering We observed that several of the men had a red circle painted round the left eye and that others were painted on their arms and on different parts of the face the eyelids of all the young women were painted black They talked much and some of them called out Capitane but when they were spoken to in Spanish Portuguese French and Dutch they made no reply Of their own language we could distinguish only one word which was  chevow  we supposed it to be a salutation as they always  pronounced it when they shook hands with us and when  by signs they asked us to give them any thing When they were spoken to in English they repeated the words after us as plainly as we could do and they soon got by heart the words "Englishmen come on shore" Every one had a missile weapon of a singular kind tucked into the girdle It consisted of two round stones covered with leather each weighing about a pound which were fastened to the two ends of a string about eight feet long This is used as a sling one stone being kept in the hand and the other whirled round the head till it is supposed to have acquired sufficient force and then discharged at the object They are so expert in the management of this doubleheaded shot that they will hit a mark not bigger than a shilling with both the stones at the distance of fifteen yards it is not their custom however to strike either the guanico or the ostrich with them in the chace but they discharge them so that the cord comes against the legs of the ostrich or two of the legs of the guanico and is twisted round them by the force and swing of the balls so that the animal being unable to run becomes an easy prey to the hunter  While we stayed on shore we saw them eat some of their flesh meat raw particularly the paunch of an ostrich without any other preparation or cleaning than just turning it inside out and shaking it We observed among them several beads such as I gave them and two pieces of red baize which we supposed had been left there or in the neighbouring country by Commodore Byron  After I had spent about four hours with these people I made signs to them that I was going on board and that I would take some of them with me if they were desirous to go As soon as I had made myself understood above an hundred  eagerly offered to visit the ship  but I did not chuse to indulge more than eight of the number They jumped into the boats with the joy and alacrity of children going to a fair and having no intention of mischief against us had not the least suspicion that we intended any mischief against them They sung several of their country songs while they were in the boat and when they came on board did not express either the curiosity or wonder which the multiplicity of objects to them equally strange and stupendous that at once presented themselves might be supposed to excite I took them down into the cabbin where they looked about them with an unaccountable indifference till one of them happened to cast his eyes upon a lookingglass this however excited no more astonishment than the prodigies which offer themselves to our imagination in a dream when we converse with the dead fly in the air and walk upon the sea without reflecting that the laws of nature are violated but it afforded them infinite diversion they advanced retreated and played a thousand tricks before it laughing violently and talking with great emphasis to each other I gave them some beef pork biscuit and other articles of the ship's provisions they eat indiscriminately whatever was offered to them but they would drink nothing but water From the cabbin I carried them all over the ship but they looked at nothing with much attention except the animals which we had on board as live stock they examined the hogs and sheep with some curiosity and were exceedingly delighted with the Guinea hens and turkies they did not seem to desire any thing that they saw except our apparel and only one of them an old man asked for that we gratified him with a pair of shoes and buckles and to each of the others I gave a canvas bag in which I put some needles ready threaded a few slips of cloth a knife a pair of scissars some twine a  few beads a comb and a lookingglass  with some new sixpences and halfpence through which a hole had been drilled that was fitted with a riband to hang round the neck We offered them some leaves of tobacco rolled up into what are called segars and they smoked a little but did not seem fond of it I showed them the great guns but they did not appear to have any notion of their use After I had carried them through the ship I ordered the marines to be drawn up and go through part of their exercise When the first volley was fired they were struck with astonishment and terror the old man in particular threw himself down upon the deck pointed to the muskets and then striking his breast with his hand lay some time motionless with his eyes shut by this we supposed he intended to shew us that he was not unacquainted with firearms and their fatal effect The rest seeing our people merry and finding themselves unhurt soon resumed their cheerfulness and good humour and heard the second and third volley fired without much emotion but the old man continued prostrate upon the deck some time and never recovered his spirits till the firing was over About noon the tide being out I acquainted them by signs that the ship was proceeding farther and that they must go on shore this I soon perceived they were very unwilling to do all however except the old man and one more were got into the boat without much difficulty but these stopped at the gangway where the old man turned about and went aft to the companion ladder where he stood some time without speaking a word he then uttered what we supposed to be a prayer for he many times lifted up his hands and his eyes to the heavens and spoke in a manner and tone very different from what we had observed in their conversation his oraison seemed to be rather sung than said so that we found it impossible to distinguish one  word from another  When I again intimated that it was proper for him to go into the boat he pointed to the sun and then moving his hand round to the west he paused looked in my face laughed and pointed to the shore by this it was easy to understand that he wished to stay on board till sunset and I took no little pains to convince him that we could not stay so long upon that part of the coast before he could be prevailed upon to go into the boat at length however he went over the ship's side with his companion and when the boat put off they all began to sing and continued their merriment till they got on shore When they landed great numbers of those on shore pressed eagerly to get into the boat but the officer on board having positive orders to bring none of them off prevented them though not without great difficulty and apparently to their extream mortification and disappointment  When the boat returned on board I sent her off again with the master to sound the shoal that runs off from the point he found it about three miles broad from north to south and that to avoid it it was necessary to keep four miles off the Cape in twelve or thirteen fathom water  CHAP II  The Passage through the Streight of Magellan with some further account of the Patagonians and a description of the Coast on each side and its Inhabitants  ABOUT one o'clock on Wednesday the th of December  I made the signal and weighed ordering the Swallow to go ahead and the storeship to bring up the rear The wind was right against us and blew fresh so that we were obliged to turn into the Streight of Magellan with the floodtide between Cape Virgin Mary and the Sandy Point that resembles Dungeness When we got abreast of this Point we stood close into the shore where we saw two guanicoes and many of the natives on horseback who seemed to be in pursuit of them when the horsemen came near they ran up the country at a great rate and were pursued by the hunters with their slings in their hands ready for the cast but neither of them was taken while they were within the reach of our sight  When we got about two leagues to the west of Dungeness and were standing off shore we fell in with a shoal upon which we had but seven fathom water at half flood this obliged us to make short tacks and keep continually heaving the lead At half an hour after eight in the evening we anchored about three miles from the shore in fathom with a muddy bottom Cape Virgin Mary then bearing N E by E ½ E Point Possession W ½ S at the distance of about five leagues  About half an hour after we had cast anchor  the natives made several large fires abreast of the ship and at break of day we saw about four hundred of them encamped in a fine green valley between two hills with their horses feeding beside them  About six o'clock in the morning the tide being done we got again under sail it's course here is from east to west it rises and falls thirty feet and its strength is equal to about three knots an hour About noon there being little wind and the ebb running with great force the Swallow who was ahead made the signal and came to an anchor upon which I did the same and so did the storeship that was astern  As we saw great numbers of the natives on horseback abreast of the ship and as Captain Carteret informed me that this was the place where Commodore Byron had the conference with the tall men I sent the lieutenants of the Swallow and the storeship to the shore but with orders not to land as the ships were at too great a distance to protect them When these gentlemen returned they told me that the boat having lain upon her oars very near the beach the natives came down in great numbers whom they knew to be the same persons they had seen the day before with many others particularly women and children that when they perceived out people had no design to land they seemed to be greatly disappointed and those who had been on board the ship waded off to the boat making signs for it to advance and pronouncing the words they had been taught "Englishmen come on shore" very loud many times that when they found they could not get the people to land they would fain have got into the boat and that it was with great difficulty they were prevented That they presented them  with some bread tobacco and a few toys pointing at the same time to some guanicoes and ostriches and making signs that they wanted them as provisions but that they could not make themselves understood that finding they could obtain no refreshment they rowed along the shore in search of fresh water but that seeing no appearance of a rivulet they returned on board  At six o'clock the next morning we weighed  the Swallow being still ahead and at noon we anchored in Possession bay having twelve fathom with a clean sandy bottom Point Possession at this time bore East distant three leagues the Asses Ears west and the entrance of the Narrows S W ½ W the bottom of the bay which was the nearest land to the ship was distant about three miles We saw a great number of Indians upon the Point and at night large fires on the Terra del Fuego shore  From this time to the d  we had strong gales and heavy feas so that we got on but slowly and we now anchored in fathom with a muddy bottom The Asses Ears bore N W by W ½ W Point Possession N E by E and the point of the Narrows on the south side S S W distant between three and four leagues In this situation our longitude by observation was ° ′ W latitude ° ′ S The tide here sets S E by S and N E by N at the rate of about three knots an hour the water rises four and twenty feet and at this time it was high water at four in the morning  In the morning of the d we made sail  turning to windward but the tide was so strong that the Swallow was set one way the Dolphin another and the storeship a third there was a fresh breeze but not one of the vessels would answer her helm We had various soundings and saw the rippling in the middle ground in these circumstances  sometimes backing  sometimes filling we entered the first Narrows About six o'clock in the evening the tide being done we anchored on the south shore in fathom with a sandy bottom the Swallow anchored on the north shore and the storeship not a cable's length from a sand bank about two miles to the eastward The streight here is only three miles wide and at midnight the tide being slack we weighed and towed the ship through A breeze sprung up soon afterwards  which continued till seven in the morning and then died away We steered from the first Narrows to the second S W and had fathom with a muddy bottom At eight we anchored two leagues from the shore in fathom Cape Gregory bearing W ½ N and Sweepstakes Foreland S W ½ W The tide here ran seven knots an hour and such  bores  sometimes came down with immense quantities of weeds that we expected every moment to be adrift  The next day  being Christmas day we sailed through the second Narrows In turning through this part of the Streight we had fathom within half a mile of the shore on each side and in the middle fathom fathom and no ground At five o'clock in the evening the ship suddenly shoaled from fathom to St Bartholomew's island then bearing S ½ W distant between three and four miles and Elizabeth island S S W ½ W distant five or six miles About half an hour after eight o'clock the weather being rainy and tempestuous we anchored under Elizabeth island in fathom with hard gravelly ground Upon this island we found great quantities of celery which by the direction of the surgeon was given to the people with boiled wheat and portable soup for breakfast every morning Some of the officers who went ashore with their guns saw two small dogs and several places where fires had been recently  made with many fresh shells of muscles and limpets lying about them they saw also several wigwams or huts consisting of young trees which being sharpened at one end and thrust into the ground in a circular form the other ends were brought to meet and fastened together at the top but they saw none of the natives  From this place we saw many high mountains bearing from S to W S W several parts of the summits were covered with snow though it was the midst of summer in this part of the world they were clothed with wood about three parts of their height and above with herbage except where the snow was not yet melted This was the first place where we had seen wood in all South America  At two o'clock in the morning of the th we weighed  and having a fair wind were abreast of the north end of Elizabeth's island at three at half an hour after five being about midway between Elizabeth's island and St George's island we suddenly shoaled our water from fathom to six we struck the ground once but the next cast had no bottom with fathom When we were upon this shoal Cape Porpoise bore W S W ½ W the southend of Elizabeth's island W N W ½ W distant three leagues and the southend of Saint George's island N E distant four leagues The storeship which was about half a league to the southward of us had once no more than four fathom and for a considerable time not seven the Swallow which was three or four miles to the southward had deep water for she kept near to St George's island In my opinion it is safest to run down from the northend of Elizabeth's island about two or three miles from the shore and so on all the way to Port Famine At noon a low point bore E ½ N Freshwater Bay S W ½ W At this time we were about three miles distant  from the north shore  and had no ground with fathom Our longitude by observation which was made over the shoal was ° ′ W our latitude ° ′ S  About four o'clock we anchored in Port Famine Bay in fathom and there being little wind sent all the boats and towed in the Swallow and Prince Frederick  The next morning  the weather being squally we warped the ship farther into the harbour and moored her with a cable each way in nine fathom I then sent a party of men to pitch two large tents in the bottom of the bay for the sick the wooders and the sailmakers who were soon after sent on shore with the surgeon the gunner and some midshipmen Cape St Anne now bore N E by E distant three quarters of a mile and Sedger River S ½ W  On the th we unbent all the sails  and sent them on shore to be repaired erected tents upon the banks of Sedger River and sent all the empty casks on shore with the coopers to trim them and a mate and ten men to wash and fill them We also hauled the seine and caught fish in great plenty some of them resembled a mullet but the flesh was very soft and among them were a few smelts some of which were twenty inches long and weighed four and twenty ounces  During our whole stay in this place we caught fish enough to furnish one meal a day both for the sick and the well we found also great plenty of celery and peatops which were boiled with the pease and portable soup besides these we gathered great quantities of fruit that resembled the cranberry and the leaves of a shrub somewhat like our thorn which were remarkably sour When we arrived all our people began to look pale and meagre many had the scurvy to a great degree and upon others there were manifest signs of its approach yet in a fortnight there was not  a scorbutic person in either of the ships Their recovery was effected by their being on shore eating plenty of vegetables being obliged to wash their apparel and keep their persons clean by daily bathing in the sea  The next day we set up the forge on shore  and from this time the armourers carpenters and the rest of the people were employed in refitting the ship and making her ready for the sea  In the mean time a considerable quantity of wood was cut and put on board the storeship to be sent to Falkland's island and as I well knew there was no wood growing there I caused some thousands of young trees to be carefully taken up with their roots and a proper quantity of earth and packing them in the best manner I could I put them also on board the storeship with orders to deliver them to the commanding officer at Port Egmont and to sail for that place with the first fair wind putting on board two of my seamen who being in an ill state of health when they first came on board were now altogether unfit to proceed in the voyage  On Wednesday the th of January  we got all our people and tents on board having taken in seventyfive tons of water from the shore and twelve months provisions of all kinds at whole allowance for ourselves and ten months for the Swallow from on board the storeship I sent the master in the cutter which was victualed for a week to look out for anchoring places on the north shore of the Streight  After several attempts to sail  the weather obliged us to continue in our old station till Saturday the th when the Prince Frederick Victualer sailed for Falkland's island and  the master returned from his expedition The master reported that he had found four places in which there was good anchorage between the place where we lay and Cape Froward that he had been on shore at several places where he had found plenty of wood and water close to the beach with abundance of cranberries and wild celery He reported also that he had seen a great number of currant bushes full of fruit though none of it was ripe and a great variety of beautiful shrubs in full blossom bearing flowers of different colours particularly red purple yellow and white besides great plenty of the winter's bark a grateful spice which is well known to the botanists of Europe He shot several wild ducks geese gulls a hawk and two or three of the birds which the sailors call a RaceHorse  At five o'clock in the morning of Sunday the th  we made sail and at noon being about two miles from the shore Cape Froward bore N by E a bluff point N N W and Cape Holland W ½ S Our latitude at this place by observation was ° ′ S and we found the Streight to be about six miles wide Soon after I sent a boat into Snug bay to lie at the anchoring place but the wind coming from the land I stood off again all night and at a mile from the shore we had no ground with fathom  In the morning of Monday the th  the Swallow having made the signal for anchoring under Cape Holland we ran in and anchored in fathom with a clear sandy bottom Upon sending the boats out to sound we discovered that we were very near a reef of rocks we therefore tripped the anchor and dropped farther out where we had fathom and were about half a mile from the shore just opposite to a large stream of water which falls with great rapidity from  the mountains for the land he  is of a stupendous height Cape Holland bore W S W ½ W distant two miles and Cape Froward E Our latitude by observation was ° ′ S  The next morning we got off some water  and great plenty of wild celery but could get no fish except a few muscles I sent off the boats to sound and found that there was good anchorage at about half a mile from the shore quite from the Cape to four miles below it and close by the Cape a good harbour where a ship might refresh with more safety than at Port Famine and avail herself of a large river of fresh water with plenty of wood celery and berries though the place affords no fish except muscles  Having completed our wood and water  we sailed from this place on the d about three o'clock in the afternoon At nine in the evening the ship being about two miles distant from the shore Cape Gallant bore W ½ N distant two leagues Cape Holland E by N distant six leagues Cape Gallant and Cape Holland being nearly in one a white patch in Monmouth's island bore S S W ¾ W Rupert's island W S W At this place the Streight is not more than five miles over and we found a tide which produced a very unusual effect for it became impossible to keep the ship's head upon any point  At six the next morning  the Swallow made the signal for having found anchorage and at eight we anchored in a bay under Cape Gallant in fathom with a muddy bottom The east point of Cape Gallant bore S W by W ¼ W the extream point of the eastermost land E by S a point making the mouth of a river N by W and the white patch on Charles's island S W The boats being sent out to sound found good anchorage every where except within two cables length S W of the ship where it was coral and  deepened to fathom In the afternoon I sent out the master to examine the bay and a large lagoon and he reported that the lagoon was the most commodious harbour we had yet seen in the Streight having five fathom at the entrance and from four to live in the middle that it was capable of receiving a great number of vessels had three large fresh water rivers and plenty of wood and celery We had here the misfortune to have a seine spoiled by being entangled with the wood that lies sunk at the mouth of these rivers but though we caught but little fish we had an incredible number of wild ducks which we found a very good succedaneum  The mountains are here very lofty and the master of the Swallow climbed one of the highest hoping that from the summit he should obtain a fight of the South Sea but he found his view intercepted by mountains still higher on the southern shore before he descended however he erected a pyramid within which he deposited a bottle containing a shilling and a paper on which was written the ship's name and the date of the year a memorial which possibly may remain there as long as the world endures  In the morning of the th we took two boats and examined Cordes bay  which we found very much inferior to that in which the ship lay it had indeed a larger lagoon but the entrance of it was very narrow and barred by a shoal on which there was not sufficient depth of water for a ship of burden to float the entrance of the bay also was rocky and within it the ground was foul  In this place we saw an animal that resembled an ass but it had a cloven hoof as we discovered afterwards by tracking it and was as swift as a deer This was the first animal we had seen in the Streight except at the entrance where we  found the guanicoes that we would fain have trafficked for with the Indians We shot at this creature but we could not hit it probably it is altogether unknown to the naturalists of Europe  The country about this place has the most dreary and forlorn appearance that can be imagined the mountains on each side the Streight are of an immense height about one fourth of the ascent is covered with trees of a considerable size in the space from thence to the middle of the mountain there is nothing but withered shrubs above these are patches of snow and fragments of broken rock and the summit is altogether rude and naked towering above the clouds in vast crags that are piled upon each other and look like the ruins of Nature devoted to everlasting sterility and desolation  We went over in two boats to the Royal Islands and sounded but found no bottom a very rapid tide set through wherever there was an opening and they cannot be approached by shipping without the most imminent danger Whoever navigates this part of the Streight should keep the north shore close on board all the way and not venture more than a mile from it till the Royal Islands are passed The current sets easterly through the whole four and twenty hours and the indraught should by all means be avoided The latitude of Cape Gallant road is ° ′ S  We continued in this station taking in wood and water and gathering muscles and herbs  till the morning of the th when a boat that had been sent to try the current returned with an account that it set nearly at the rate of two miles an hour but that the wind being northerly we might probably get round to Elizabeth bay or York road before night we therefore weighed with all expedition At noon on the th  the west point of Cape Gallant bore W N W  distant half a mile and the white patch on Charles's island S E by S We had fresh gales and heavy flaws off the land and at two o'clock the west point of Cape Gallant bore E distant three leagues and York Point W N W distant five leagues At five we opened York road the Point bearing N W at the distance of half a mile at this time the ship was taken aback and a strong current with a heavy squall drove us so far to leeward that it was with great difficulty we got into Elizabeth bay and anchored in fathom near a river The Swallow being at anchor off the point of the bay and very near the rocks I sent all the boats with anchors and hausers to her assistance and at last she was happily warped to windward into good anchorage York Point now bore W by N a shoal with weeds upon it W N W at the distance of a cable's length Point Passage S E ½ E distant half a mile a rock near Rupert's isle S ½ E and a rivulet on the bay N E by E distant about three cable's length Soon after sunset we saw a great smoke on the southern shore and another on Prince Rupert's island  Early in the morning I sent the boats on shore for water  and soon after our people landed three canoes put off from the south shore and landed sixteen of the natives on the east point of the bay When they came within about a hundred yards of our people they stopt called out and made signs of friendship our people did the same shewing them some beads and other toys At this they seemed pleased and began to shout our people imitated the noise they made and shouted in return the Indians then advanced still shouting and laughing very loud When the parties met they shook hands and our men presented the Indians with several of the toys which they had shewn them at a distance They were covered with seal skins which stunk abominably and some of them were eating the rotten flesh and blubber raw  with a keen appetite and great seeming satisfaction  Their complexion was the same as that of the people we had seen before but they were low of stature the tallest of them not being more than five foot six they appeared to be perishing with cold and immediately kindled several fires How they subsist in winter it is not perhaps easy to guess for the weather was at this time so severe that we had frequent falls of snow They were armed with bows arrows and javelins the arrows and javelins were pointed with flint which was wrought into the shape of a serpent's tongue and they discharged both with great force and dexterity scarce ever failing to hit a mark at a considerable distance To kindle a fire they strike a pebble against a piece of mundic holding under it to catch the sparks some moss or down mixed with a whitish earth which takes fire like tinder they then take some dry grass of which there is every where plenty and putting the lighted moss into it wave it to and fro and in about a minute it blazes  When the boat returned she brought three of them on board the ship but they seemed to regard nothing with any degree of curiosity except our cloaths and a lookingglass the lookingglass afforded them as much diversion as it had done the Patagonians and it seemed to surprize them more when they first peeped into it they started back first looking at us and then at each other they then took another peep as it were by stealth starting back as before and then eagerly looking behind it when by degrees they became familiar with it they smiled and seeing the image smile in return they were exceedingly delighted and burst into fits of the most violent laughter They left this however and every thing else with perfect indifference the little they possessed being to all appearance equal to their desires They  eat whatever was given them  but would drink nothing but water  When they left the ship I went on shore with them and by this time several of their wives and children were come to the wateringplace I distributed some trinkets among them with which they seemed pleased for a moment and they gave us some of their arms in return they gave us also several pieces of mundic such as is found in the tin mines of Cornwall they made us understand that they found it in the mountains where there are probably mines of tin and perhaps of more valuable metal As this seems to be the most dreary and inhospitable country in the world not excepting the worst parts of Sweden and Norway the people seem to be the lowest and most deplorable of all human beings Their perfect indifference to every thing they saw which marked the disparity between our state and their own though it may preserve them from the regret and anguish of unsatisfied desires seems notwithstanding to imply a defect in their nature for those who are satisfied with the gratifications of a brute can have little pretension to the prerogatives of men When they left us and embarked in their canoes they hoisted a seal skin for a sail and steered for the southern shore where we saw many of their hovels and we remarked that not one of them looked behind either at us or at the ship so little impression had the wonders they had seen made upon their minds and so much did they appear to be absorbed in the present without any habitual exercise of their power to reflect upon the past  In this station we continued till Tuesday the d of February  At about half an hour past twelve we weighed and in a sudden squall were taken aback so as that both ships were in the most imminent danger of being driven ashore  on a reef of rocks the wind however suddenly shifted  and we happily got off without damage At five o'clock in the afternoon the tide being done and the wind coming about to the west we bore away for York road and at length anchored in it the Swallow at the same time being very near Island bay under Cape Quod endeavoured to get in there but was by the tide obliged to return to York road In this situation Cape Quod bore W ½ S distant miles York Point E S E distant one mile Bachelor's River N N W three quarters of a mile the entrance of Jerom's Sound N W by W and a small island on the south shore W by S We found the tide here very rapid and uncertain in the stream it generally set to the eastward but it sometimes though rarely set westward six hours together This evening we saw five Indian canoes come out of Bachelor's River and go up Jerom's Sound  In the morning  the boats which I had sent out to sound both the shores of the Streight and all parts of the bay returned with an account that there was good anchorage within Jerom's Sound and all the way thither from the ship's station at the distance of about half a mile from the shore also between Elizabeth and York Point near York Point at the distance of a cable and a half's length from the weeds in fathom with a muddy bottom There were also several places under the islands on the south shore where a ship might anchor but the force and uncertainty of the tides and the heavy gusts of wind that came off the high lands by which these situations were surrounded rendered them unsafe Soon after the boats returned I put fresh hands into them and went myself up Bachelor's River we found a bar at the entrance which at certain times of the tide must be dangerous We hauled the seine and should have caught plenty of fish if it had not been for the weeds and  stumps of trees at the bottom of the river We then went ashore where we saw many wigwams of the natives and several of their dogs who as soon as we came in sight ran away We also saw some ostriches but they were beyond the reach of our pieces we gathered muscles limpets seaeggs celery and nettles in great abundance About three miles up this river on the west side between Mount Misery and another mountain of a stupendous height there is a cataract which has a very striking appearance it is precipitated from an elevation of above four hundred yards half the way it rolls over a very steep declivity and the other half is a perpendicular fall The sound of this cataract is not less awful than the sight  In this place contrary winds detained us till o'clock in the morning of Saturday the th  when we weighed and in half an hour the current set the ship towards Bachelor's River we then put her in stays and while she was coming about which she was long in doing we drove over a shoal where we had little more than feet water with rocky ground so that our danger was very great for the ship drew feet inches aft and feet one inch forward as soon as the ship gathered way we happily deepened into three fathom within two cables' length we had five and in a very short time we got into deep water We continued plying to windward till four o'clock in the afternoon and then finding that we had lost ground we returned to our station and again anchored in York road  Here we remained till five o'clock in the morning of the th  when we weighed and towed out of the road At nine though we had a fine breeze at west the ship was carried with great violence by a current towards the south shore the boats were all towing ahead and the sails asleep yet we  drove so close to the rock  that the oars of the boats were entangled in the weeds In this manner we were hurried along near three quarters of an hour expecting every moment to be dashed to pieces against the cliff from which we were seldom farther than a ship's length and very often not half so much We sounded on both sides and found that next the shore we had from to fathom and on the other side of the ship no bottom as all our efforts were ineffectual we resigned ourselves to our fate and waited the event in a state of suspense very little different from despair At length however we opened Saint David's Sound and a current that rushed out of it set us into the midchannel During all this time the Swallow was on the north shore and consequently could know nothing of our danger till it was past We now sent the boats out to look for an anchoring place and at noon Cape Quod bore N N E and Saint David's head S E  About one o'clock the boats returned having found an anchoring place in a small bay to which we gave the name of Butler's bay it having been discovered by Mr Butler one of the mates It lies to the west of Rider's bay on the south shore of the Streight which is here about two miles wide We ran in with the tide which set fast to the westward and anchored in fathom water The extreams of the bay from W by N to N ½ W are about a quarter of a mile asunder a small rivulet at the distance of somewhat less than two cables' length bore S ½ W and Cape Quod N at the distance of four miles At this time the Swallow was at anchor in Island bay on the north shore at about six miles distance  I now sent all the boats out to sound round the ship and in the neighbouring bays and they returned with an account  that they could find no place fit to receive the ship neither could any such place be found between Cape Quod and Cape Notch  In this place we remained till Friday the th  when about noon the clouds gathered very thick to the westward and before one it blew a storm with such rain and hail as we had scarcely ever seen We immediately struck the yards and topmasts and having run out two hausers to a rock we hove the ship up to it we then let go the small bower and veered away and brought both cables ahead at the same time we carried out two more hausers and made them fast to two other rocks making use of every expedient in our power to keep the ship steady The gale continued to increase till six o'clock in the evening and to our great astonishment the sea broke quite over the forecastle in upon the quarterdeck which considering the narrowness of the Streight and the smallness of the bay in which we were stationed might well have been thought impossible Our danger here was very great for if the cables had parted as we could not run out with a sail and as we had not room to bring the ship up with any other anchor we must have been dashed to pieces in a few minutes and in such a situation it is highly probable that every soul would immediately have perished however by eight o'clock the gale was become somewhat more moderate and gradually decreasing during the night  we had tolerable weather the next morning Upon heaving the anchor we had the satisfaction to find that our cable was sound though our hausers were much rubbed by the rocks notwithstanding they were parcelled with old hammacoes and other things The first thing I did after performing the necessary operations about the ship was to send a boat to the Swallow to enquire how she had fared during the gale the boat returned with an account that she had felt but  little of the gale but that she had been very near being lost  in pushing through the Islands two days before by the rapidity of the tide that notwithstanding an alteration which had been made in her rudder she steered and worked so ill that every time they got under way they were apprehensive that she could never safely be brought to an anchor again I was therefore requested in the name of the captain to consider that she could be of very little service to the expedition and to direct what I thought would be best for the service I answered that as the Lords of the Admiralty had appointed her to accompany the Dolphin she must continue to do it as long as it was possible that as her condition rendered her a bad sailer I would wait her time and attend her motions and that if any disaster should happen to either of us the other should be ready to afford such assistance as might be in her power  We continued here eight days during which time we completed our wood and water dried our sails and sent great part of the ship's company on shore to wash their cloathes and stretch their legs which was the more necessary as the cold snowy and tempestuous weather had confined them too much below We caught muscles and limpets and gathered celery and nettles in great abundance The muscles were the largest we had ever seen many of them being from five to six inches long we caught also great plenty of a fine firm red fish not unlike a gurnet most of which were from four to five pounds weight At the same time we made it part of the employment of every day to try the current which we found constantly setting to the eastward  The master having been sent out to look for anchoring places returned with an account that he could find no shelter except near the shore where it should not be sought but in  cases of the most pressing necessity  He landed upon a large island on the north side of Snow Sound and being almost perished with cold the first thing he did was to make a large fire with some small trees which he found upon the spot He then climbed one of the rocky mountains with Mr Pickersgill a midshipman and one of the seamen to take a view of the Streight and the dismal regions that surround it He found the entrance of the Sound to be full as broad as several parts of the Streight and to grow but very little narrower for several miles in land on the Terra del Fuego side The country on the south of it was still more dreary and horrid than any he had yet seen it consisted of craggy mountains much higher than the clouds that were altogether naked from the base to the summit there not being a single shrub nor even a blade of grass to be seen upon them nor were the vallies between them less desolate being intirely covered with deep beds of snow except here and there where it had been washed away or converted into ice by the torrents which were precipitated from the fissures and crags of the mountain above where the snow had been dissolved and even these vallies in the patches that were free from snow were as destitute of verdure as the rocks between which they lay  On Sunday the first of March  at half an hour after four o'clock in the morning we saw the Swallow under sail on the north shore of Cape Quod At seven we weighed and stood out of Butler's bay but it falling calm soon afterwards the boats were obliged to take the vessel in tow having with much difficulty kept clear of the rocks the passage being very narrow we sent the boats about noon to seek for anchorage on the north shore At this time Cape Notch bore W by N ½ N distant between three and four leagues and Cape Quod E ½ N distant three leagues  About three o'clock in the afternoon there being little wind we anchored with the Swallow under the north shore in a small bay where there is a high steep rocky mountain the top of which resembles the head of a lion for which reason we called the bay Lion's Cove We had here fathom with deep water close to the shore and at half a cable's length without the ship no ground We sent the boats to the westward in search of anchoring places and at midnight they returned with an account that there was an indifferent bay at the distance of about four miles and that Goodluck bay was three leagues to the westward  At half an hour after the next day  the wind being northerly we made sail from Lion's Cove and at five anchored in Good Luck bay at the distance of about half a cable's length from the rocks in fathom water A rocky island at the west extremity of the bay bore N W by W distant about a cable's length and a half and a low point which makes the eastern extremity of the bay bore E S E distant about a mile Between this point and the ship there were many shoals and in the bottom of the bay two rocks the largest of which bore N E by N the smallest N by E From these rocks shoals run out to the S E which may be known by the weeds that are upon them the ship was within a cable's length of them when she swung with her stern in shore we had fathom with coral rock when she swung off we had fathom with sandy ground Cape Notch bore from us W by S ½ W distant about one league and in the intermediate space there was a large lagoon which we could not sound the wind blowing too hard all the while we lay here After we had moored the ship we sent two boats to assist the Swallow and one to look out for anchorage beyond Cape Notch The boats that were sent to assist the Swallow towed her into a small bay where  as the wind was southerly and blew fresh she was in great danger for the Cove was not only small but full of rocks and open to the southeasterly winds  All the day following  and all the night we had hard gales with a great sea and much hail and rain The next morning we had gusts so violent  that it was impossible to stand the deck they brought whole sheets of water all the way from Cape Notch which was a league distant quite over the deck They did not last more than a minute but were so frequent that the cables were kept in a constant strain and there was the greatest reason to fear that they would give way It was a general opinion that the Swallow could not possibly ride it out and some of the men were so strongly prepossessed with the notion of her being lost that they fancied they saw some of her people coming over the rocks towards our ship The weather continued so bad till Saturday the seventh  that we could send no boat to enquire after her but the gale being then more moderate a boat was dispatched about four o'clock in the morning which about the same hour in the afternoon returned with an account that the ship was safe but that the fatigue of the people had been incredible the whole crew having been upon the deck near three days and three nights At midnight the gusts returned though not with equal violence with hail sleet and snow The weather being now extremely cold and the people never dry  I got up the next morning eleven bales of thick woollen stuff called Fearnought which is provided by the government and set all the taylors to work to make them into jackets of which every man in the ship had one  I ordered these jackets to be made very large allowing one with another two yards and thirtyfour inches of the cloth  to each jacket I sent also seven bales of the same cloth to the Swallow which made every man on board a jacket of the same kind and I cut up three bales of finer cloth and made jackets for the officers of both ships which I had the pleasure to find were very acceptable  In this situation we were obliged to continue a week during which time I put both my own ship and the Swallow upon twothirds allowance except brandy but continued the breakfast as long as greens and water were plenty  On Sunday the th about noon  we saw the Swallow under sail and it being calm we sent our launch to assist her In the evening the launch returned having towed her into a very good harbour on the south shore opposite to where we lay The account that we received of this harbour determined us to get into it as soon as possible the next morning therefore at eight o'clock we sailed from Good Luck bay and thought ourselves happy to get safe out of it When we got abreast of the harbour where the Swallow lay we fired several guns as signals for her boats to assist us in getting in and in a short time the master came on board us and piloted us to a very commodious station where we anchored in fathom with a muddy bottom This harbour which is sheltered from all winds and excellent in every respect we called SWALLOW HARBOUR There are two channels into it which are both narrow but not dangerous as the rocks are easily discovered by the weeds that grow upon them  At nine o'clock the next morning  the wind coming easterly we weighed and sailed from Swallow harbour At noon we took the Swallow in tow but at five there being little wind we cast off the tow At eight in the evening the boats which had been sent out to look for anchorage  returned with an account that they could find none at nine we had fresh gales and at midnight Cape Upright bore S S W ½ W  At seven the next morning  we took the Swallow again in tow but was again obliged to cast her off and tack as the weather became very thick with a great swell and we saw land close under our lee As no place for anchorage could be found Captain Carteret advised me to bear away for Upright bay to which I consented and as he was acquainted with the place he went ahead the boats were ordered to go between him and the shore and we followed At eleven o'clock there being little wind we opened a large lagoon and a current setting strongly into it the Swallow was driven among the breakers close upon the lee shore to aggravate the misfortune the weather was very hazey there was no anchorage and the surf ran very high In this dreadful situation she made signals of distress and we immediately sent our launch and other boats to her assistance the boats took her in tow but their utmost efforts to save her would have been ineffectual if a breeze had not suddenly come down from a mountain and wafted her off  As a great swell came on about noon we hauled over to the north shore We soon found ourselves surrounded with islands but the fog was so thick that we knew not where we were nor which way to steer Among these islands the boats were sent to cast the lead but no anchorage was to be found we then conjectured that we were in the bay of islands and that we had no chance to escape shipwreck but by hauling directly out this however was no easy task for I was obliged to tack almost continually to weather some island or rock At four o'clock in the afternoon it happily cleared up for a minute just to shew us Cape Upright  for which we directly steered and at half an hour after five anchored with the Swallow in the bay When we dropped the anchor we were in fathom and after we had veered away a whole cable in with a muddy bottom In this situation a high bluff on the north shore bore N W ½ N distant five leagues and a small island within us S by E ½ E Soon after we had anchored the Swallow drove to leeward notwithstanding she had two anchors ahead but was at last brought up in fathom about a cable's length astern of us At four o'clock in the morning I sent the boats with a considerable number of men and some hausers and anchors on board her to weigh her anchors and warp her up to windward When her best bower anchor was weighed it was found entangled with the small one I therefore found it necessary to send the stream cable on board and the ship was hung up by it To clear her anchors and warp her into a proper birth cost us the whole day and was not at last effected without the utmost difficulty and labour  On the th we had fresh breezes  and sent the boats to sound cross the Streight Within half a mile of the ship they had fathom and then had no ground till within a cable's length of the lee shore where they had fathom We now moored the ship in fathom with the stream anchor  The next morning  while our people were employed in getting wood and water and gathering celery and muscles two canoes full of Indians came along side of the ship They had much the same appearance as the poor wretches whom we had seen before in Elizabeth's bay They had on board some seal's flesh blubber and penguins all which they cat raw Some of our people who were fishing with a  hook and line  gave one of them a fish somewhat bigger than a herring alive just as it came out of the water The Indian took it hastily as a dog would take a bone and instantly killed it by giving it a bite near the gills he then proceeded to eat it beginning with the head and going on to the tail without rejecting either the bones fins scales or entrails They eat every thing that was given them indifferently whether salt or fresh dressed or raw but would drink nothing but water They shivered with cold yet had nothing to cover them but a seal skin thrown loosely over their shoulders which did not reach to their middle and we observed that when they were rowing they threw even this by and sat stark naked They had with them some javelins rudely pointed with bone which they used to strike seals fish and penguins and we observed that one of them had a piece of iron about the size of a common chissel which was fastened to a piece of wood and seemed to be intended rather for a tool than a weapon They had all sore eyes which we imputed to their sitting over the smoke of their fires and they smelt more offensively than a fox which perhaps was in part owing to their diet and in part to their nastiness Their canoes were about fifteen foot long three broad and nearly three deep they were made of the bark of trees sewn together either with the sinews of some beast or thongs cut out of a hide Some kind of rush was laid into the seams and the outside was smeared with a resin or gum which prevented the water from soaking into the bark Fifteen slender branches bent into an arch were fewed transversely to the bottom and sides and some strait pieces were placed cross the top from gunwale to gunwale and securely lashed at each end upon the whole however it was poorly made nor had these people any thing among them in which there was the least appearance of ingenuity  I gave them a hatchet or two with some beads  and a few other toys with which they went away to the southward and we saw no more of them  While we lay here we sent out the boats as usual in search of anchoring places and having been leagues to the westward they found but two one was to the westward of Cape Upright in the Bay of Islands but was very difficult to enter and get out of the other was called Dolphin bay at leagues distance which was a good harbour with even ground in all parts They saw several small coves which were all dangerous as in them it would be necessary to let go the anchor within half a cable's length of a lee shore and steady the ship with halsers fastened to the rocks The people belonging to one of the boats spent a night upon an island upon which while they were there six canoes landed about thirty Indians The Indians ran immediately to the boat and were carrying away every thing they found in her out people discovered what they were doing just time enough to prevent them As soon as they found themselves opposed they went to their canoes and armed themselves with long poles and javelins pointed with the bones of fish They did not begin an attack but stood in a threatening manner our people who were two and twenty in number acted only on the defensive and by parting with a few trifles to them they became friends and behaved peaceably the rest of the time they staid  For many days we had hail lightning rain and hard gales with a heavy sea so that we thought it impossible for the ship to hold though she had two anchors ahead and two cables an end The men however were sent frequently on shore for exercise which contributed greatly to  their health and procured an almost constant supply of muscles and greens Among other damages that we had sustained our fireplace was broken to pieces we therefore found it necessary to set up the forge and employ the armourers to make a new back we also made lime of burnt shells and once more put it into a useful condition  On Monday the th  we had the first interval of moderate weather and we improved it in drying the sails which though much mildewed we had not before been able to loose for fear of setting the ship adrift we also aired the spare sails which we found much injured by the rats and employed the sailmakers to mend them Captain Carteret having represented that his fireplace as well as ours had been broken to pieces our armourers made him also a new back and set it up with lime that we made upon the spot in the same manner as had been done on board our own ship This day we saw several canoes full of Indians put to shore on the east side of the bay  and the next morning several of them came on board and proved to be the same that our people who were out in the boat had met with on shore They behaved very peaceably and we dismissed them with a few toys as usual  The day following  several other Indians came off to the ship and brought with them some of the birds called RaceHorses Our people purchased the birds for a few trifles and I made them a present of several hatchets and knives  On Thursday the second of April  the master of the Swallow who had been sent out to seek for anchoring places returned and reported that he had found three on the north shore which were very good one about four miles to the eastward of Cape Providence another under the east side of  Cape Tamer  and the third about four miles to the eastward of it but he said that he found no place to anchor in under Cape Providence the ground being rocky  This day two canoes came on board with four men and three young children in each The men were somewhat more decently dressed than those that we had seen before but the children were stark naked They were somewhat fairer than the men who seemed to pay a very tender attention to them especially in lifting them in and out of the canoes To these young visitors I gave necklaces and bracelets with which they seemed mightily pleased It happened that while some of these people were on board and the rest waiting in their canoes by the ship's side the boat was sent on shore for wood and water The Indians who were in the canoes kept their eyes fixed upon the boat while she was manning and the moment she put off from the ship they called out with great vociferation to those that were on board who seemed to be much alarmed and hastily handing down the children leaped into their canoes without uttering a word None of us could guess at the cause of this sudden emotion but we saw the men in the canoes pull after the boat with all their might hallooing and shouting with great appearance of perturbation and distress The boat outrowed them and when she came near the shore the people on board discovered some women gathering muscles among the rocks This at once explained the mystery the poor Indians were afraid that the strangers either by force or favour should violate the prerogative of a husband of which they seemed to be more jealous than the natives of some other countries who in their appearance are less savage and sordid Our people to make them easy immediately lay upon their oars and suffered the canoes to pass them The Indians however still continued to call  out to their women till they took the alarm and ran out of sight and as soon as they got to land drew their canoes upon the beach and followed them with the utmost expedition  We continued daily to gather muscles till the th  when several of the people being seized with fluxes the surgeon desired that no more muscles might be brought into the ship  The weather being still tempestuous and unsettled we remained at anchor till o'clock in the morning of Friday the th  and then in company with the Swallow we made sail At noon Cape Providence bore N N W distant four or five miles at four in the afternoon Cape Tamer bore N W by W ½ W distant three leagues Cape Upright E S E ½ S distant three leagues and Cape Pillar W distant leagues We steered about W ½ N all night and at six o'clock in the morning  had run eight and thirty miles by the log At this time Cape Pillar bore S W distant half a mile and the Swallow was about three miles astern of us At this time there being but little wind we were obliged to make all the sail we could to get without the Streight's mouth At o'clock I would have shortened sail for the Swallow but it was not in my power for as a current set us strongly down upon the Isles of Direction and the wind came to the west it became absolutely necessary for me to carry sail that I might clear them Soon after we lost sight of the Swallow and never saw her afterwards At first I was inclined to have gone back into the Streight but a fog coming on and the sea rising very fast we were all of opinion that it was indispensibly necessary to get an ossing as soon as possible for except we pressed the ship with sail before the sea rose too high it would be impracticable either to weather Terra del Fuego on one tack or Cape Victory on  the other At noon  the Islands of Direction bore N ′ W distant three leagues Saint Paul's cupola and Cape Victory in one N distant seven leagues and Cape Pillar E distant six leagues  Our latitude by observation was ° ′ and we computed our longitude to be ° W  Thus we quitted a dreary and inhospitable region where we were in almost perpetual danger of shipwreck for near four months having entered the Streight on the th of December and quitted it on the th of April a region where in the midst of summer the weather was cold gloomy and tempestuous where the prospects had more the appearance of a chaos than of Nature and where for the most part the vallies were without herbage and the hills without wood  CHAP III  A particular Account of the Places in which we anchored during our Passage through the Streight and of the Shoals and Rocks that lie near them  HAVING cleared the Streight we steered a western course But before I continue the narrative of our voyage I shall give a more particular account of the several places where we anchored plans of which are deposited in the Admiralty Office for the use of future navigators with the shoals and rocks that lie near them the latitude longitude tides and variation of the compass  I CAPE VIRGIN MARY The bay under this Cape is a good harbour when the wind is westerly There is a shoal lying off the Cape but that may easily be known by the rock weed that grows upon it the Cape is a steep white cliff not unlike the South Foreland Its latitude by observation is ° ′ S and its longitude by account ° ′ W The variation of the needle by the medium of five azimuths and one amplitude was ° ′ E In this place we saw no appearance either of wood or water We anchored in fathom with coarse sandy ground about a mile from the shore Cape Virgin Mary bearing N by W ½ W distant about two miles and Dungeness Point S S W distant four miles We anchored here on the th of December and sailed the next day There is good landing on a fine sandy beach all along the shore  II POSSESSION BAY In sailing into this bay it is necessary to give the point a good birth because there is a reef  that runs right off it about a short mile The soundings are very irregular all over the bay but the ground is every where a fine soft mud and clay so that the cables can come to no damage The Point lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude by account ° ′ W the variation is two points easterly In the bay the tide rises and falls between four and five fathom and runs at the rate of about a mile an hour in the midchannel without the bay it runs nearly three miles an hour In this place we saw no appearance either of wood or water The landing appeared to be good but we did not go on shore We anchored here on the th of December and sailed again on the d  III PORT FAMINE At this place the Spaniards in the year built a town which they called Phillippeville and left in it a colony consisting of persons When our celebrated navigator Cavendish arrived here in he found one of these unhappy wretches the only one that remained upon the beach they had all perished for want of subsistence except twentyfour twentythree of these set out for the river Plata and were never afterwards heard of This man whose name was Hernando was brought to England by Cavendish who called the place where he had taken him up Port Famine It is a very fine bay in which there is room and conveniency for many ships to moor in great safety We moored in nine fathom having brought Cape St Anne N E by E and Sedger River S ½ W which perhaps is the best situation though the whole bay is good ground In this place there is very good wooding and watering we caught many fine small fish with a hook and line off the ship's side and hauled the seine with great success in a fine sandy bay a little to the southward of Sedger River we also shot a great number of birds of various kinds particularly geese ducks teal snipes plover and racehorses and we  found wild celery in great plenty The latitude of this place is ° ′ S longitude by observation ° ′ W the variation is two points easterly We anchored here the th of December and sailed again the th of January  IV CAPE HOLLAND BAY There is no danger in sailing into this bay and there is good anchoring ground in every part of it We lay at about three cables' length from the shore in fathom the ground coarse sand and shells Cape Holland bearing W S W ½ W distant three miles Cape Froward a little to the N of the E Right abreast of the ship there was a very fine rivulet and close under Cape Holland a large river navigable for boats many miles the shore also affords fire wood in great plenty We found abundance of wild celery and cranberries muscles and limpets but caught very little fish either with hook and line or the seine We killed some geese ducks teal and racehorses but they were not plenty This bay lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude by account ° ′ W the variation is two points easterly The water rose about eight feet we found however no regular tide but for the most part a strong current setting to the eastward We anchored here on the th of January and sailed again on the d  V CAPE GALLLANT BAY In this bay which may be entered with great safety there is a fine large lagoon where a fleet of ships may moor in perfect security There is a depth of four fathom in every part of it with a soft muddy ground In the bay the best anchoring is on the east side where there is from six to ten fathom Here is good watering from two rivers and plenty of wood The lagoon abounded with wild fowl and we found wild celery muscles and limpets in plenty We did not haul the seine having torn one to pieces and the other being unpacked  but if we had there is reason to believe that we should have been well supplied with fish The landing is good The latitude of the bay and lagoon is ° ′ S longitude by account ° ′ W the variation is two points easterly I observed the water to rise and fall about nine feet but the tide was very irregular We anchored here the d of January and sailed again the th  VI ELIZABETH's BAY At the entrance of this bay there are two small reefs which appear above water The most dangerous lies off the east point of the bay but this may easily be avoided by keeping at the distance of about two cables' length from the point There is good landing all round the bay but it is much exposed to the westerly winds The best place for anchoring is Passage Point at half a mile distance bearing S E and the river bearing N E by E distant three cables' length in this situation a bank or shoal which may be known by the weeds bears W N W distant a cable's length the ground is coarse sand with shells Sufficient wood is to be procured here for the use of ships and there is good watering at a small river We found a little celery and a few cranberries but neither fish nor fowl The latitude of this place is ° ′ S the longitude by account ° ′ W the variation is two points easterly We anchored here the th of January and sailed the th of February  VII YORK ROAD The only danger of sailing into the bay that is formed by two points in this road arises from a reef that runs off to about a cable's length from the western point which once known may be easily avoided To anchor in this bay it is safest to bring York Point E S E Bachelor's River N by W ½ W the west point of the bay or reef N W ½ W and St Jerom's Sound W N W at the distance of  half a mile from the shore There is good watering about a mile up Bachelor's River and good wooding all round the bay where the landing also is in all parts very good We found plenty of celery cranberries muscles and limpets many wild fowl and some fish but not enough to supply the ship's company with a fresh meal The latitude here is ° ′ S longitude by account ° ′ W the variation two points easterly The water rises and falls about eight feet but the tide is irregular The master who crossed the Streight many times to examine the bays frequently found the current setting in three different directions We anchored here on the th of February and sailed again the th  VIII BUTLER's BAY This is a small bay intirely surrounded by rocks so that no ship should anchor here if she can possibly avoid it We found however sufficient wood and water to keep up our stock muscles and limpets in plenty some good rockfish and a few wild fowl but celery and cranberries were very scarce This bay lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude by account ° ′ W the variation is two points easterly The water rises and falls here about four feet but the current always sets to the eastward We anchored here the th of February and sailed the st of March  IX LION COVE This is a small bay and surrounded by rocks The water is deep but the ground is good It is not a bad place for one ship nor a good one for two Here is good watering up a small creek but no wood There is good landing at the wateringplace but no where else We found no refreshment but a few muscles limpets and rockfish with a little celery The latitude is ° ′ S longitude by account ° ′ W the variation was two points easterly The water as far as we could judge by the appearance of  the rocks rises and falls about five feet and the current sets at the rate of about two knots an hour We anchored here on the d of March and sailed the next day  X GOODLUCK BAY This is a small bay and like several others in this Streight intirely surrounded by rocks The ground is very coarse and the cable of our best bower anchor was so much rubbed that we were obliged to condemn it and bend a new one At this place there is a little wood and plenty of good water but the rocks render it very difficult of access No man that sees this part of the coast can expect to find any kind of refreshment upon it and indeed we caught nothing except a few rockfish with hook and line There may be circumstances in which it may be good luck to get into this bay but we thought it very good luck to get out of it It lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude by account ° ′ W the variation is two points easterly The water rises and falls between three and four feet though whenever we had an opportunity of trying the current we found it run easterly We anchored here the d of March and sailed the th  XI SWALLOW HARBOUR This harbour when once entered is very safe being sheltered from all winds but the entrance is narrow and rocky the rocks however may be easily avoided by keeping a good lookout as there are large bunches of rockweed upon them all We found here a sufficient supply of wood and water the wood however was very small As the water is constantly smooth here the landing is every where good but we found no supply of provisions except a few muscles and rockfish The mountains round it have the most horrid appearance and seem to be altogether deserted by every thing that has life The latitude is ° ′ S the longitude by account ° ′ W the  variation is two points easterly and the tide rises and falls between four and five feet We anchored here the th of March and left the place the next day  XII UPRIGHT BAY This bay may be safely entered as there is no obstruction but what is above water The wood here is very small but we found sufficient to keep up our stock The water is excellent and in great plenty As to provisions we got only a few wild fowl rockfishes and muscles The landing is bad The latitude of this place is ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W the variation two points easterly The water rises and falls about five feet but the tide or current is very irregular We anchored here on the th of March and sailed again on the th of April  There are three very good bays a little beyond Cape Shutup which we called RIVER BAY LODGING BAY and WALLIS's BAY Wallis's bay is the best  About half way between Elizabeth's bay and York road lies Muscle bay where there is very good anchorage with a westerly wind There is also a bay with good anchorage opposite to York road and another to the eastward of Cape Crosstide but this will hold only a single ship Between Cape Cross and Saint David's Head lies Saint David's Sound on the south side of which we found a bank of coarse sand and shells with a depth of water from to fathom where a ship might anchor in case of necessity and the Master of the Swallow found a very good small bay a little to the eastward of Saint David's Head A little to the eastward of Cape Quod lies Island bay where the Swallow lay some time but it is by no means an eligible situation The ground of Chance bay is very rocky and uneven and for that reason should be avoided  As all the violent gales by which we suffered in this navigation blew from the westward it is proper to stand about a hundred leagues or more to the westward after sailing out of the Streight that the ship may not be endangered on a lee shore which at present is wholly unknown

Otaheite in the South Sea with an account of the Discovery of several other Islands and a description of their Inhabitants  AS we continued our course to the westward  after having cleared the Streight we saw a great number of gannets sheerwaters pintado birds and many others about the ship and had for the most part strong gales hazy weather and heavy seas so that we were frequently brought under our courses and there was not a dry place in the ship for some weeks together  At eight in the morning of the d  we had an observation by which we found our longitude to be ° ′ W and at noon our latitude was ° ′ S and the variation by azimuth ° ′ E  By the th  the men began to fall down very fast in colds and fevers in consequence of the upper works being open and their cloaths and beds continually wet  On the th at four in the afternoon the variation  by azimuth  was ° ′ E and at six in the morning of the next day it was ° ′ E Our latitude on the th at noon was ° ′ S our longitude by account ° W This day the weather being moderate and fair we dried all the people's cloaths and got the sick upon deck to whom we gave salop  and wheat boiled with portable soup every morning for breakfast and all the ship's company had as much vinegar and mustard as they could use portable soup was also constantly boiled in their pease and oatmeal  The hard gales with frequent and violent squalls and a heavy sea soon returned and continued with very little intermission The ship pitched so much that we were afraid she would carry away her masts and the men were again wet in their beds  On the th  the variation by azimuth was ° ′ E our latitude was ° ′ longitude by account ′ W I began now to keep the ship to the northward as we had no chance of getting westing in this latitude and the surgeon was of opinion that in a little time the sick would so much increase that we should want hands to work the ship if we could not get into better weather  On the third of May  about four in the afternoon we had an observation of the sun and moon by which we found our longitude to be ° ′ W the variation by the azimuth was ° ′ E at six in the evening  and at six the next morning it was ° ′ E Our latitude this day at noon was ° ′ S At four in the afternoon we had several observations for the longitude and found it to be ° ′ W at seven in the evening the variation was ° ′ E by the azimuth and the next morning at it was  by amplitude ° ′ E at three in the afternoon the variation by amplitude was ° ′ E This day we saw a tropic bird  At six o'clock in the morning of Friday the eighth of May  the variation of the needle by amplitude was ° ′ E In the afternoon we saw several sheerwaters and sea swallows At eight in the morning of the th  the variation by  azimuth was ° ′ E and in the morning of the th  by azimuth and amplitude it was ° ′ E Our latitude was ° ′ S longitude by account ° W This day and the next we saw several sea swallows sheerwaters  and porpoises about the ship  On the th of May the variation by four azimuths  was ° E About four o'clock in the afternoon we saw a large flock of brown birds slying to the eastward and something which had the appearance of high land in the same quarter We bore away for it till sunset and it still having the same appearance we continued our course but at two in the morning having run leagues without making it we hauled the wind and at daylight nothing was to be seen We had now the satisfaction to find our ailing people mend apace Our latitude was ° ′ S our longitude by account ° W During all this time we were looking out for the Swallow  At four in the afternoon of the th the variation  by azimuth and amplitude was ° E and at six the next morning by four azimuths it was ° ′  The carpenters were now employed in caulking the upper works of the ship and repairing and painting the boats and on the th  I gave a sheep among the people that were sick and recovering  On Wednesday the th we found our longitude  by observation to be ° ′ W and our latitude ° ′ S The next day we saw several flying fish  which were the first we had seen in these seas  On the d our longitude by observation  was ° W and our latitude ° ′ S and this day we saw some bonettoes dolphins and tropic birds  The people who had been recovering from colds and fevers now began to fall down in the scurvy upon which at the surgeon's representation wine was served to them wort was also made for them of malt and each man had half a pint of pickled cabbage every day The variation from to E  On the th we saw two grampuses on the th we saw another  and the next day several birds among which was one about the size of a swallow which some of us thought was a land bird  Our men now began to look very pale and sickly and to fall down very fast in the scurvy notwithstanding all our care and attention to prevent it They had vinegar and mustard without limitation wine instead of spirits sweet wort and salop Portable soup was still constantly boiled in their peas and oatmeal their birth and cloaths were kept perfectly clean the hammocks were constantly brought upon the deck at eight o'clock in the morning and carried down at four in the afternoon Some of the beds and hammocks were washed every day the water was rendered wholesome by ventilation and every part between decks frequently washed with vinegar  On Sunday the st of May  our longitude by observation was ° ′ W our latitude ° ′ S and the variation by azimuth and amplitude ° ′ E  The next day  at three in the afternoon our longitude by observation was ° ′ W and our latitude ° ′ S We had squally weather with much lightning and rain and saw several men of war birds  On the d  we saw several gannets which with the uncertainty of the weather inclined us to hope that land was not  very far distant  The next day a turtle swam close by the ship on the th we saw many birds which confirmed our hope that some place of refreshment was near and at o'clock in the forenoon of the th Jonathan Puller a seaman called out from the masthead "Land in the W N W" At noon it was seen plainly from the deck and found to be a low island at about five or six leagues distance The joy which every one on board felt at this discovery can be conceived by those only who have experienced the danger sickness and fatigue of such a voyage as we had performed  When we were within about five miles of this island we saw another bearing N W by W About three o'clock in the afternoon being very near the island that was first discovered we brought to and I sent Mr Faurneaux my second lieutenant my first lieutenant being very ill with the boats manned and armed to the shore As he approached it we saw two canoes put off and paddle away with great expedition towards the island that lay to leeward At seven in the evening the boats returned and brought with them several cocoa nuts and a considerable quantity of scurvygrass they brought also some fish hooks that were made of oystershells and some of the shells of which they were made They reported that they had seen none of the inhabitants but had visited three huts or rather sheds consisting only of a roof neatly thatched with cocoa nut and palm leaves supported upon posts and open all round They saw also several canoes building but found no fresh water nor any fruit but cocoa nuts They sounded but found no anchorage and it was with great difficulty that they got on shore as the surf ran very high Having received this account I stood off and on all night  and early the next morning I sent the boats out again to sound with orders if possible to find a place where the ship might come to an  anchor  but at o'clock they returned with no better success than before The people told me that the whole island was surrounded by a reef and that although on the weather side of the island there was an opening through it into a large bason that extended to the middle of the island yet they found it so full of breakers that they could not venture in neither indeed had they been able to land on any part of the island the surf running still higher than it had done the day before As it would therefore answer no purpose to continue here I hoisted the boats in and stood away for the other island which bore S ° E distant about four leagues The island which I now quitted having been discovered on Whitsuneve I called it WHITSUN ISLAND  It is about four miles long and three wide Its latitude is ° ′ S and its longitude by observation ° ′ W  When we came under the lee of the other island I sent Lieutenant Furneaux with the boats manned and armed to the shore where I saw about fifty of the natives armed with long pikes and several of them running about with firebrands in their hands I ordered Mr Furneaux to go to that part of the beach where we saw the people and endeavour to traffick with them for fruit and water or whatever else might be useful at the same time being particularly careful to give them no offence I ordered him also to employ the boats in sounding for anchorage About seven o'clock he returned and told me that he could find no ground with the line till he came within half a cable's length of the shore and that there it consisted of sharp rocks and lay very deep  As the boat approached the shore the Indians thronged down towards the beach and put themselves upon their guard with their long pikes as if to dispute the landing Our men then lay upon their oars and made signs of friendship  shewing at the same time several strings of beads  ribands knives and other trinkets The Indians still made signs to out people that they should depart but at the same time eyed the trinkets with a kind of wishful curiosity Soon after some of them advanced a few steps into the sea and our people making signs that they wanted cocoa nuts and water some of them brought down a small quantity of both and ventured to hand them into the boat the water was in cocoa nutshells and the fruit was stripped of its outward covering which is probably used for various purposes For this supply they were paid with the trinkets that had been shewed them and some nails upon which they seemed to set a much greater value During this traffick one of the Indians found means to steal a silk handkerchief in which some of our small merchandize was wrapped up and carried it clear off with its contents so dexterously that no body observed him Our people made signs that a handkerchief had been stolen but they either could not or would not understand them The boat continued about the beach sounding for anchorage till it was dark and having many times endeavoured to persuade the natives to bring down some scurvygrass without success she returned on board  I stood off and on with the ship all night  and as soon as the day broke I sent the boats again with orders to make a landing but without giving any offence to the natives that could possibly be avoided When our boats came near the shore the officer was greatly surprised to see seven large canoes with two stout masts in each lying just in the surf with all the inhabitants upon the beach ready to embark They made signs to our people to go higher up they readily complied and as soon as they went ashore all the Indians embarked and sailed away to the westward being joined  by two other canoes at the west end of the island  About noon the boats returned laden with cocoa nuts palm nuts and scurvygrass Mr Furneaux who commanded the expedition told me that the Indians had left nothing behind them but four or five canoes He found a well of very good water and described the island as being sandy and level full of trees but without underwood and abounding with scurvygrass The canoes which steered about W S W as long as they could be seen from the masthead appeared to be about thirty feet long four feet broad and three and an half deep Two of these being brought along side of each other were fastened together at the distance of about three feet asunder by cross beams passing from the larboard gunwale of one to the starboard gunwale of the other in the middle and near to each end  The inhabitants of this island were of a middle stature and dark complexion with long black hair which hung loose over their shoulders The men were well made and the women handsome Their cloathing was a kind of coarse cloth or matting which was fastened about their middle and seemed capable of being brought up round their shoulders  In the afternoon I sent Lieutenant Furneaux with the boats again on shore He had with him a mate and twenty men who were to make a rolling way for getting the casks down to the beach from the well I gave orders that he should take possession of the island in the name of King George the Third and give it the name of QUEEN CHARLOTTE's ISLAND  in honour of her Majesty The boats returned freighted with cocoa nuts and scurvygrass and the officer told me that he had found two more wells of good water not far from the beach I was at this time very ill yet I went ashore with the Surgeon and several of the people  who were enfeebled by the scurvy to take a walk  I found the wells so convenient that I left the mate and twenty men on shore to fill water and ordered a week's provisions to be sent them from the ship they being already furnished with arms and ammunition In the evening I returned on board with the Surgeon and the sick leaving only the waterers on shore As we had not been able to find any anchorage I stood off and on all night  In the morning  I sent all the empty water casks on shore the Surgeon and the sick were also sent for the benefit of another airing but I gave them strict orders that they should keep near the waterside and in the shade that they should not pull down or injure any of the houses nor for the sake of the fruit destroy the cocoa trees which I appointed proper persons to climb At noon the rollingway being made the cutter returned laden with water but it was with great difficulty got off the beach as it is all rock and the surf that breaks upon it is often very great At four I received another boatload of water and a fresh supply of cocoa nuts palm nuts and scurvygrass the Surgeon also returned with the sick men who received much benefit from their walk The next morning  as soon as it was light I dispatched orders to the mate to send all the water that was filled on board and to be ready to come off with his people when the boats should return again bringing with them as many cocoa nuts and as much scurvygrass as they could procure About eight o'clock all the boats and people came on board with the water and refreshments but the cutter in coming off shipped a sea which almost filled her with water the barge was happily near enough to assist her by taking great part of her crew on board while the rest freed her without any other damage than the loss of the cocoa nuts and greens that were on  board  At noon I hoisted the boats in and there being a great sea with a dreadful surf rolling in upon the shore and no anchorage I thought it prudent to leave this place with such refreshments as we had got The people who had resided on shore saw no appearance of metal of any kind but several tools which were made of shells and stones sharpened and fitted into handles like adzes chissels and awls They saw several canoes building which are formed of planks sewed together and fastened to several small timbers that pass transversely along the bottom and up the sides They saw several repositories of the dead in which the body was left to putrefy under a canopy and not put into the ground  When we sailed we left a union jack flying upon the island with the ship's name the time of our being here and an account of our taking possession of this place and Whitsun Island in the name of his Britannic Majesty cut on a piece of wood and in the bark of several trees We also left some hatchets nails glass bottles beads shillings sixpences and halfpence as presents to the natives and an atonement for the disturbance we had given them Queen Charlotte's Island is about six miles long and one mile wide lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude by observation ° ′ W and we found the variation here to be ° ′ E  We made sail with a fine breeze and about one o'clock saw an island W by S Queen Charlotte's Island at this time bearing E by N distant miles At half an hour after three we were within about three quarters of a mile of the east end of the island and ran close along the shore but had no soundings The east and west ends are joined to each other by a reef of rocks over which the sea breaks into a lagoon in the middle of the island which therefore had  the appearance of two islands  and seemed to be about six miles long and four broad The whole of it is low land full of trees but we saw not a single cocoa nut nor any huts we found however at the westermost end all the canoes and people who had fled at our approach from Queen Charlotte's Island and some more We counted eight double canoes and about fourscore people men women and children The canoes were drawn upon the beach the women and children were placed near them and the men advanced with their pikes and firebrands making a great noise and dancing in a strange manner We observed that this island was sandy and that under the trees there was no verdure As the shore was every where rocky as there was no anchorage and as we had no prospect of obtaining any refreshment here I set sail at six o'clock in the evening from this island to which I gave the name of EGMONT ISLAND  in honour of the Earl of Egmont who was then first Lord of the Admiralty It lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude by observation ° ′ W  At one o'clock on the th  we saw an island in the W S W and stood for it At four in the afternoon we were within a quarter of a mile of the shore and ran along it sounding continually but could get no ground It is surrounded on every side by rocks on which the sea breaks very high It is full of trees but not one cocoa nut and has much the same appearance with Egmont island but is much narrower Among the rocks at the west end we saw about sixteen of the natives but no canoes they carried long pikes or poles in their hands and seemed to be in every respect the same kind of people that we had seen before As nothing was to be had here and it blew very hard I made sail till eight in the evening and then brought to To this island which is about six miles long and from  one mile to one quarter of a mile broad I gave the name of GLOUCESTER ISLAND  in honour of his Royal Highness the Duke It lies in latitude ° ′ S and longitude by observation ° ′ W  At five o'clock in the morning  we made sail and soon after saw another island At o'clock the weather being tempestuous with much rain we saw a long reef with breakers on each side of the island and therefore brought the ship to with her head off the shore To this island which lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude by observation ° ′ W I gave the name of CUMBERLAND ISLAND  in honour of his Royal Highness the Duke It lies low and is about the same size as Queen Charlotte's Island We found the variation of the needle here to be ° ′ E As I had no hope of finding any refreshment here I stood on to the westward  At daybreak on Saturday the th  we saw another small low island in the N N W right to windward It had the appearance of small flat keys This place I called PRINCE WILLIAM HENRY's ISLAND  in honour of his Majesty's third son It lies in latitude ° S longitude by observation ° ′ W I made no stay here hoping that to the westward I should find higher land where the ship might come to an anchor and such refreshments as we wanted be procured  Soon after daylight on the th  we saw land bearing W by N and making in a small round hummock At noon when it bore N W distant about five leagues its appearance greatly resembled the Mewstone in Plymouth Sound but it seemed to be much larger We found the ship this day miles to the northward of her reckoning which I imputed to a great S W swell  At five in the evening  this island bore N W distant about eight miles I then hauled the wind and stood on and off all night At ten we saw a light upon the shore which though the island was small proved that it was inhabited and gave us hopes that we should find anchorage near it We observed with great pleasure that the land was very high and covered with cocoa trees a sure sign that there was water  The next morning  I sent Lieutenant Furneaux to the shore with the boats manned and armed and all kinds of trinkets to establish a traffick with the natives for such refreshment as the place would afford I gave him orders also to find if possible an anchoring place for the ship While we were getting out the boats several canoes put off from the island but as soon as the people on board saw them make towards the shore they put back At noon the boats returned and brought with them a pig and a cock with a few plantains and cocoa nuts Mr Furneaux reported that he had seen at least an hundred of the inhabitants and believed there were many more upon the island but that having been all round it he could find no anchorage nor scarcely a landingplace for the boat When he reached the shore he came to a grapling and threw a warp to the Indians upon the beach who caught it and held it fast He then began to converse with them by signs and observed that they had no weapon among them but that some of them had white sticks which seemed to be ensigns of authority as the people who bore them kept the rest of the natives back In return for the pig and the cock he gave them some beads a lookingglass a few combs with several other trinkets and a hatchet The women who had been kept at a distance as soon as they saw the trinkets ran down in a croud to the beach with great eagerness but were soon driven away by  the men  at which they expressed much disappointment and vexation While this traffick was carrying on a man came secretly round a rock and diving down took up the boat's grappling and at the same time the people on shore who held the warp made an effort to draw her into the surf As soon as this was perceived by the people on board they fixed a musket over the man's head who had taken up the grappling upon which he instantly let it go with marks of great terror and astonishment the people on shore also let go the rope The boats after this lay some time upon their oars but the officer finding that he could get nothing more returned on board Mr Furneaux told me that both the men and women were cloathed and he brought a piece of their cloth away with him The inhabitants appeared to him to be more numerous than the island could support and for this reason especially as he saw some large double canoes upon the beach he imagined there were islands of larger extent not far distant where refreshments in greater plenty might be procured and hoped that they might be less difficult of access As I thought this a reasonable conjecture I hoisted in the boats and determined to run farther to the westward To this place which is nearly circular and about two miles over I gave the name of OSNABURGH ISLAND  in honour of Prince Frederick who is bishop of that see It lies in latitude ° ′ S and longitude ° ′ W the variation here was ° ′ E  CHAP V  An Account of the Discovery of King George the Third's Island or Otaheite and of several Incidents which happened both on board the Ship and on Shore  AT two o'clock the same day we bore away  and in about half an hour discovered very high land in the W S W At seven in the evening Osnaburgh Island bore E N E and the new discovered land from W N W to W by S As the weather was thick and squally we brought to for the night or at least till the fog should break away At two in the morning it being very clear we made sail again  at daybreak we saw the land at about five leagues distance and steered directly for it but at eight o'clock when we were close under it the fog obliged us again to lie to and when it cleared away we were much surprised to find ourselves surrounded by some hundreds of canoes They were of different sizes and had on board different numbers from one to ten so that in all of them together there could not be less than eight hundred people When they came within pistol shot of the ship they lay by gazing at us with great astonishment and by turns conferring with each other In the mean time we shewed them trinkets of various kinds and invited them on board Soon after they drew together and held a kind of council to determine what should be done then they all paddled round the ship making signs of friendship and one of them holding up a branch of the plantain tree made a speech that lasted near a quarter of an  hour  and then threw it into the sea Soon after as we continued to make signs of invitation a fine stout lively young man ventured on board he came up by the mizen chains and jumped out of the shrouds upon the top of the awning We made signs to him to come down upon the quarterdeck and handed up some trinkets to him he looked pleased but would accept of nothing till some of the Indians came along side and after much talk threw a few branches of plantain tree on board the ship He then accepted our presents and several others very soon came on board at different parts of the ship not knowing the proper entrance As one of these Indians was standing near the gangway on the larboard side of the quarterdeck one of our goats butted him upon the haunches being surprised at the blow he turned hastily about and saw the goat raised upon his hindlegs ready to repeat the blow The appearance of this animal so different from any he had ever seen struck him with such terror that he instantly leaped over board and all the rest upon seeing what had happened followed his example with the utmost precipitation they recovered however in a short time from their fright and returned on board After having a little reconciled them to our goats and sheep I shewed them our hogs and poultry and they immediately made signs that they had such animals as these I then distributed trinkets and nails among them and made signs that they should go on shore and bring us some of their hogs fowls and fruit but they did not seem to understand my meaning they were in the mean time watching an opportunity to steal some of the things that happened to lie in their way but we generally detected them in the attempt At last however one of the midshipmen happened to come where they were standing with a new laced hat upon his head and began to talk to  one of them by signs while he was thus engaged  another of them came behind him and suddenly snatching off the hat leaped over the taffarel into the sea and swam away with it  As we had no anchorage here we stood along the shore sending the boats at the same time to sound at a less distance As none of these canoes had sails they could not keep up with us and therefore soon paddled back towards the shore The country has the most delightful and romantic appearance that can be imagined towards the sea it is level and is covered with fruit trees of various kinds particularly the cocoa nut Among these are the houses of the inhabitants consisting only of a roof and at a distance having greatly the appearance of a long barn The country within at about the distance of three miles rises into lofty hills that are crowned with wood and terminate in peaks from which large rivers are precipitated into the sea We saw no shoals but found the island skirted by a reef of rocks through which there are several openings into deep water About three o'clock in the afternoon we brought to abreast of a large bay where there was an appearance of anchorage The boats were immediately sent to sound it and while they were thus employed I observed a great number of canoes gather round them I suspected that the Indians had a design to attack them and as I was very desirous to prevent mischief I made the signal for the boats to come aboard and at the same time to intimidate the Indians I fired a nine pounder over their heads As soon as the cutter began to stand towards the ship the Indians in their canoes though they had been startled by the thunder of our nine pounder endeavoured to cut her off The boat however sailing faster than the canoes could paddle soon got clear of those that were about her but some others that  were full of men  waylaid her in her course and threw several stones into her which wounded some of the people Upon this the officer on board fired a musquet loaded with buckshot at the man who threw the first stone and wounded him in the shoulder The rest of the people in the canoes as soon as they perceived their companion wounded leapt into the sea and the other canoes paddled away in great terror and confusion As soon as the boats reached the ship they were hoisted on board and just as she was about to stand on we observed a large canoe under sail making after us As I thought she might have some Chief on board or might have been dispatched to bring me a message from some Chief I determined to wait for her She sailed very fast and was soon along side of the ship but we did not observe among those on board any one that seemed to have an authority over the rest One of them however stood up and having made a speech which continued about five minutes threw on board a branch of the plantain tree We understood this to be a token of peace and we returned it by handing over one of the branches of plantain that had been left on board by our first visitors with this and some toys that were afterwards presented to him he appeared to be much gratified and after a short time went away  The officers who had been sent out with the boats informed me that they had sounded close to the reef and found as great a depth of water as at the other islands however as I was now on the weather side of the island I had reason to expect anchorage in running to leeward I therefore took this course but finding breakers that ran off to a great distance from the southend of the island I hauled the wind and continued turning to windward all night in order to run down on the east side of the island  At five o'clock in the morning we made sail  the land bearing N W by W distant leagues and there seemed to be land five leagues beyond it to the N E a remarkable peak like a sugar loaf bore N N E when we were about two leagues from the shore which afforded a most delightful prospect and was full of houses and inhabitants We saw several large canoes near the shore under sail but they did not steer towards the ship At noon we were within two or three miles of the island and it then bore from S ¾ W to N W by W We continued our course along the shore sometimes at the distance of half a mile and sometimes at the distance of four or five miles but hitherto had got no soundings At six o'clock in the evening we were abreast of a fine river and the coast having a better appearance here than in any other part that we had seen I determined to stand off and on all night and try for anchorage in the morning As soon as it was dark we saw a great number of lights all along the shore At daybreak  we sent out the boats to sound and soon after they made the signal for fathom This produced an universal joy which it is not easy to describe and we immediately ran in and came to an anchor in fathom with a clear sandy bottom We lay about a mile distant from the shore opposite to a fine run of water the extreams of the land bearing from E S E to N W by W As soon as we had secured the ship I sent the boats to sound along the coast and look at the place where we saw the water At this time a considerable number of canoes came off to the ship and brought with them hogs fowls and fruit in great plenty which we purchased for trinkets and nails But when the boats made towards the shore the canoes most of which were double and very large sailed after them At first they kept at a distance but as the boats approached the  shore  they grew bolder and at last three of the largest ran at the cutter staved in her quarter and carried away her outrigger the Indians preparing at the same time to board her with their clubs and paddles in their hands Our people being thus pressed were obliged to fire by which one of the assailants was killed and another much wounded Upon receiving the shot they both fell overboard and all the people who were in the same canoe instantly leaped into the sea after them the other two canoes dropped astern and our boats went on without any farther interruption As soon as the Indians who were in the water saw that the boats stood on without attempting to do them any farther hurt they recovered their canoe and hauled in their wounded companions They set them both upon their feet to see if they could stand and finding they could not they tried whether they could sit upright one of them could and him they supported in that posture but perceiving that the other was quite dead they laid the body along at the bottom of the canoe After this some of the canoes went ashore and others returned again to the ship to traffick which is a proof that our conduct had convinced them that while they behaved peaceably they had nothing to fear and that they were conscious they had brought the mischief which had just happened upon themselves  The boats continued sounding till noon when they returned with an account that the ground was very clear that it was at the depth of five fathom within a quarter of a mile of the shore but that there was a very great surf where we had seen the water The officers told me that the inhabitants swarmed upon the beach and that many of them swam off to the boat with fruit and bamboos filled with water They said that they were very importunate with them to come on shore particularly the women who came down to the  beach and stripping themselves naked  endeavoured to allure them by many wanton gestures the meaning of which could not possibly be mistaken At this time however our people resisted the temptation  In the afternoon I sent the boats again to the shore with some barecas or small casks which are filled at the head and have a handle by which they are carried to endeavour to procure some water of which we began to be in great want In the mean time many of the canoes continued about the ship but the Indians had been guilty of so many thefts that I would not suffer any more of them to come on board  At five in the evening the boats returned with only two barecas of water which the natives had filled for them and as a compensation for their trouble they thought fit to detain all the rest Our people who did not leave their boat tried every expedient they could think of to induce the Indians to return their water vessels but without success and the Indians in their turn were very pressing for our people to come on shore which they thought it prudent to decline There were many thousands of the inhabitants of both sexes and a great number of children on the beach when our boats came away  The next morning  I sent the boats on shore again for water with nails hatchets and such other things as I thought most likely to gain the friendship of the inhabitants In the mean time a great number of canoes came off to the ship with breadfruit  See a description of this fruit in the Account of the Voyage of the Endeavour  plantains a fruit resembling an apple only better fowls and hogs which we purchased with beads nails knives and other articles of the like kind so  that we procured pork enough to serve the ship's company two days  at a pound a man  When the boats returned they brought us only a few calibashes of water for the number of people on the beach was so great that they would not venture to land though the young women repeated the allurements which they had practised the day before with still more wanton and if possible less equivocal gestures Fruit and provisions of various kinds were brought down and ranged upon the beach of which our people were also invited to partake as an additional inducement for them to leave the boat They continued however inexorable and shewing the Indians the barecas on board made signs that they should bring down those which had been detained the day before to this the Indians were inexorable in their turn and our people therefore weighed their grapplings and sounded all round the place to see whether the ship could come in near enough to cover the waterers in which case they might venture on shore in defiance of the whole island When they put off the women pelted them with apples and bananas shouting and shewing every mark of derision and contempt that they could devise They reported that the ship might ride in four fathom water with sandy ground at two cables' length from the shore and in five fathom water at three cables' length The wind here blew right along the shore raising a great surf on the side of the vessel and on the beach  At daybreak  the next morning we weighed with a design to anchor off the wateringplace As we were standing off to get farther to windward we discovered a bay about six or eight miles to leeward over the land from the  masthead and immediately bore away for it  sending the boats ahead to sound At nine o'clock the boats making the signal for fathom we hauled round a reef and stood in with a design to come to an anchor but when we came near the boats one of which was on each bow the ship struck Her head continued immoveable but her stern was free and upon casting the lead we found the depth of water upon the reef or shoal to be from fathom to two and a half we clewed all up as fast as possible and cleared the ship of what lumber there happened to be upon the deck at the same time getting out the longboat with the stream and kedge anchors the stream cable and hauser in order to carry them without the reef that when they had taken ground the ship might be drawn off towards them by applying a great force to the capstern but unhappily without the reef we had no bottom Our condition was now very alarming the ship continued beating against the rock with great force and we were surrounded by many hundred canoes full of men they did not however attempt to come on board us but seemed to wait in expectation of our shipwreck In the anxiety and terror of such a situation we continued near an hour without being able to do any thing for our deliverance except staving some water casks in the forehold when a breeze happily springing up from the shore the ship's head swung off We immediately pressed her with all the sail we could make upon which she began to move and was very soon once more in deep water  We now stood off and the boats being sent to leeward found that the reef ran down to the westward about a mile and a half and that beyond it there was a very good harbour The master after having placed a boat at the end of the reef and furnished the longboat with anchor and hausers  and a guard to defend her from an attack of the Indians  came on board and piloted the ship round the reef into the harbour where about twelve o'clock she came to an anchor in fathom water with a fine bottom of black sand  The place where the ship struck appeared upon farther examination to be a reef of sharp coral rock with very unequal soundings from six fathom to two and it happened unfortunately to lie between the two boats that were placed as a direction to the ship the weathermost boat having fathom and the leewardmost nine The wind freshened almost as soon as we got off and though it soon became calm again the surf ran so high and broke with such violence upon the rock that if the ship had continued fast half an hour longer she must inevitably have been beaten to pieces Upon examining her bottom we could not discover that she had received any damage except that a small piece was beaten off the bottom of the rudder She did not appear to admit any water but the trussletrees at the head of all the masts were broken short which we supposed to have happened while she was beating against the rock Our boats lost their grapplings upon the reef but as we had reason to hope that the ship was sound they gave us very little concern As soon as the ship was secured I sent the master with all the boats manned and armed to sound the upper part of the bay that if he found good anchorage we might warp the ship up within the reef and anchor her in safety The weather was now very pleasant a great number of canoes were upon the reef and the shore was crouded with people  About four in the afternoon the master returned and reported that there was every where good anchorage I therefore determined to warp the ship up the bay early in  N  o    the morning and in the mean time  I put the people at four watches one watch to be always under arms loaded and primed all the guns fixed musquetoons in all the boats and ordered all the people who were not upon the watch to repair to the quarters assigned them at a moment's warning there being a great number of canoes some of them very large and full of men hovering upon the shore and many smaller venturing to the ship with hogs fowls and fruit which we purchased of them much to the satisfaction of both parties and at sunset all the canoes rowed in to the shore  At six o'clock the next morning  we began to warp the ship up the harbour and soon after a great number of canoes came under her stern As I perceived that they had hogs fowls and fruit on board I ordered the gunner and two midshipmen to purchase them for knives nails beads and other trinkets at the same time prohibiting the trade to all other persons on board By eight o'clock the number of canoes was greatly increased and those that came last up were double of a very large size with twelve or fifteen stout men in each I observed with some concern that they appeared to be furnished rather for war than trade having very little on board except round pebble stones I therefore sent for Mr Furneaux my first lieutenant being still very ill and ordered him to keep the fourth watch constantly at their arms while the rest of the people were warping the ship In the mean time more canoes were continually coming off from the shore which were freighted very differently from the rest for they had on board a number of women who were placed in a row and who when they came near the ship made all the wanton gestures that can be conceived While these ladies were practising their allurements the large canoes which were freighted with  stones  drew together very close round the ship some of the men on board singing in a hoarse voice some blowing conchs and some playing on a flute After some time a man who sat upon a canopy that was fixed on one of the large double canoes made signs that he wished to come up to the ship's side I immediately intimated my consent and when he came along side he gave one of the men a bunch of red and yellow feathers making signs that he should carry it to me I received it with expressions of amity and immediately got some trinkets to present him in return but to my great surprise he had put off to a little distance from the ship and upon his throwing up the branch of a cocoanut tree there was an universal shout from all the canoes which at once moved towards the ship and a shower of stones was poured into her on every side As an attack was now begun in which our arms only could render us superior to the multitude that assailed us especially as great part of the ship's company was in a sick and feeble condition I ordered the guard to fire two of the quarterdeck guns which I had loaded with small shot were also fired nearly at the same time and the Indians appeared to be thrown into some confusion in a few minutes however they renewed the attack and all our people that were able to come upon deck having by this time got to their quarters I ordered them to fire the great guns and to play some of them constantly at a place on shore where a great number of canoes were still taking in men and pushing off towards the ship with the utmost expedition When the great guns began to fire there were not less than three hundred canoes about the ship having on board at least two thousand men many thousands were also upon the shore and more canoes coming from every quarter the firing however soon drove away the canoes that were about the ship and put a stop to the  coming off of others  As soon as I saw some of them retreating and the rest quiet I ordered the firing to cease hoping that they were sufficiently convinced of our superiority not to renew the contest In this however I was unhappily mistaken a great number of the canoes that had been dispersed soon drew together again and lay some time on their paddles looking at the ship from the distance of about a quarter of a mile and then suddenly hoisting white streamers pulled towards the ship's stern and began again to throw stones with great force and dexterity by the help of slings from a considerable distance each of these stones weighed about two pounds and many of them wounded the people on board who would have suffered much more if an awning had not been spread over the whole deck to keep out the sun and the hammocks placed in the nettings At the same time several canoes well manned were making towards the ship's bow having probably taken notice that no shot had been fired from this part I therefore ordered some guns forward to be well pointed and fired at these canoes at the same time running out two guns abaft and pointing them well at the canoes that were making the attack Among the canoes that were coming toward the bow there was one which appeared to have some Chief on board as it was by signals made from her that the others had been called together it happened that a shot fired from the guns forward hit this canoe so full as to cut it asunder As soon as this was observed by the rest they dispersed with such haste that in half an hour there was not a single canoe to be seen the people also who had crouded the shore immediately fled over the hills with the utmost precipitation  Having now no reason to fear any further interruption we warped the ship up the harbour and by noon we were  not more than half a mile from the upper part of the bay  within less than two cables' length of a fine river and about two and a half of the reef We had here nine fathom water and close to the shore there were five We moored the ship and carried out the streamanchor with the two shroud hausers for a spring to keep the ship's broadside abreast of the river we also got up and mounted the eight guns which had been put into the hold As soon as this was done the boats were employed in sounding all round the bay and in examining the shore where any of the inhabitants appeared in order to discover whether it was probable that they would give us any further disturbance All the afternoon  and part of the next morning was spent in this service and about noon the master returned with a tolerable survey of the place and reported that there were no canoes in sight that there was good landing on every part of the beach that there was nothing in the bay from which danger could be apprehended except the reef and some rocks at the upper end which appeared above water and that the river though it emptied itself on the other side of the point was fresh water  Soon after the master had brought me this account I sent Mr Furneaux again with all the boats manned and armed the marines being also put on board with orders to land opposite to our station and secure himself under cover of the boats and the ship in the clearest ground he could find About two o'clock the boats landed without any opposition and Mr Furneaux stuck up a staff upon which he hoisted a pendant turned a turf and took possession of the island in his Majesty's name in honour of whom he called it KING GEORGE THE THIRD's ISLAND he then went to the river and tasted the water which he found excellent and mixing some of it with rum every man drank his Majesty's health  While he was at the river  which was about twelve yards wide and fordable he saw two old men on the opposite side of it who perceiving that they were discovered put themselves in a supplicatory posture and seemed to be in great terror and confusion Mr Furneaux made signs that they should come over the river and one of them complied When he landed he came forward creeping upon his hands and knees but Mr Furneaux raised him up and while he stood trembling shewed him some of the stones that were thrown at the ship and endeavoured to make him apprehend that if the natives attempted no mischief against us we should do no harm to them He ordered two of the water casks to be filled to shew the Indian that we wanted water and produced some hatchets and other things to intimate that he wished to trade for provisions The old man during this pantomimical conversation in some degree recovered his spirits and Mr Furneaux to confirm his professions of friendship gave him a hatchet some nails beads and other trifles after which he reimbarked on board the boats and left the pendant flying As soon as the boats were put off the old man went up to the pendant and danced round it a considerable time he then retired but soon after returned with some green boughs which he threw down and retired a second time it was not long however before he appeared again with about a dozen of the inhabitants and putting themselves in a supplicating posture they all approached the pendant in a slow pace but the wind happening to move it when they were got close to it they suddenly retreated with the greatest precipitation After standing some time at a distance and gazing at it they went away but in a short time came back with two large hogs alive which they laid down at the foot of the staff and at length taking courage they began to dance When they had performed  this ceremony  they brought the hogs down to the water side launched a canoe and put them on board The old man who had a large white beard then embarked with them alone and brought them to the ship when he came along side he made a set speech and afterwards handed in several green plantain leaves one by one uttering a sentence in a solemn slow tone with each of them as he delivered it after this he sent on board the two hogs and then turning round pointed to the land I ordered some presents to be given him but he would accept of nothing and soon after put off his canoe and went on shore  At night soon after it was dark we heard the noise of many drums with conchs and other wind instruments and saw a multitude of lights all along the coast  At six in the morning seeing none of the natives on shore and observing that the pendant was taken away which probably they had learnt to despise as the frogs in the fable did King Log I ordered the lieutenant to take a guard on shore and if all was well to send off that we might begin watering in a short time I had the satisfaction to find that he had sent off for water casks and by eight o'clock we had four tons of water on board While our people were employed in filling the casks several of the natives appeared on the opposite side of the river with the old man whom the officer had seen the day before and soon after he came over and brought with him a little fruit and a few fowls which were also sent off to the ship At this time having been very ill for near a fortnight I was so weak that I could scarcely crawl about however I employed my glasses to see what was doing on shore At near half an hour after eight o'clock I perceived a multitude of the natives coming over a hill at about the distance of a mile and at the same time a great number of canoes making round the western point and  keeping close along the shore  I then looked at the wateringplace and saw at the back of it where it was clear a very numerous party of the natives creeping along behind the bushes I saw also many thousands in the woods pushing along towards the wateringplace and canoes coming very fast round the other point of the bay to the eastward Being alarmed at these appearances I dispatched a boat to acquaint the officer on shore with what I had seen and order him immediately to come on board with his men and leave the casks behind him he had however discovered his danger and embarked before the boat reached him Having perceived the Indians that were creeping towards him under shelter of the wood he immediately dispatched the old man to them making signs that they should keep at a distance and that he wanted nothing but water As soon as they perceived that they were discovered they began to shout and advanced with greater speed The officer immediately repaired to the boats with his people and the Indians in the mean time having crossed the river took possession of the water casks with great appearance of exultation and joy The canoes now pulled along the shore towards the place with the utmost expedition all the people on land keeping pace with them except a multitude of women and children who seated themselves upon a hill which overlooked the bay and the beach The canoes from each point of the bay as they drew nearer to that part of it where the ship was at anchor put on shore and took in more men who had great bags in their hands which afterwards appeared to be filled with stones All the canoes that had come round the points and many others that had put off from the shore within the bay now made towards the ship so that I had no doubt but that they intended to try  their fortune in a second attack  As to shorten the contest would certainly lessen the mischief I determined to make this action decisive and put an end to hostilities at once I therefore ordered the people who were all at their quarters to fire first upon the canoes which were drawn together in groups this was immediately done so effectually that those which were to the westward made towards the shore as fast as possible and those to the eastward getting round the reef were soon beyond the reach of our guns I then directed the fire into the wood in different parts which soon drove the Indians out of it who ran up the hill where the women and children had seated themselves to see the battle Upon this hill there were now several thousands who thought themselves in perfect security but to convince them of the contrary and hoping that when they saw the shot fall much farther than they could think possible they would suppose it could reach them at any distance I ordered some of the guns to be let down as low as they would admit and fired four shot towards them Two of the balls fell close by a tree where a great number of these people were fitting and struck them with such terror and consternation that in less than two minutes not one of them was to be seen Having thus cleared the coast I manned and armed the boats and putting a strong guard on board I sent all the carpenters with their axes and ordered them to destroy every canoe that had been run ashore Before noon this service was effectually performed and more than fifty canoes many of which were sixty feet long and three broad and lashed together were cut to pieces Nothing was found in them but stones and slings except a little fruit and a few fowls and hogs which were on board two or three canoes of a much smaller size  At two o'clock in the afternoon  about ten of the natives came out of the wood with green boughs in their hands which they stuck up near the water side and retired After a short time they appeared again and brought with them several hogs with their legs tied which they placed near the green boughs and retired a second time After this they brought down several more hogs and some dogs with their fore legs tied over their heads and going again into the woods brought back several bundles of the cloth which they use for apparel and which has some resemblance to Indian paper These they placed upon the beach and called to us on board to fetch them away As we were at the distance of about three cables' length we could not then perfectly discover of what this peaceoffering consisted we guessed at the hogs and the cloth but seeing the dogs with their fore legs appearing over the hinder part of the neck rise up several times and run a little way in an erect posture we took them for some strange unknown animal and were very impatient to have a nearer view of them The boat was therefore sent on shore with all expedition and our wonder was soon at an end Our people found nine good hogs besides the dogs and the cloth the hogs were brought off but the dogs were turned loose and with the cloth left behind In return for the hogs our people left upon the shore some hatchets nails and other things making signs to some of the Indians who were in sight to take them away with their cloth Soon after the boat had come on board the Indians brought down two more hogs and called to us to fetch them the boat therefore returned and fetched off the two hogs but still left the cloth though the Indians made signs that we should take it Our people reported that they had not touched any of the things which  they had left upon the beach for them  and somebody suggesting that they would not take our offering because we had not accepted their cloth I gave orders that it should be fetched away The event proved that the conjecture was true for the moment the boat had taken the cloth on board the Indians came down and with every possible demonstration of joy carried away all I had sent them into the wood Our boats then went to the wateringplace and filled and brought off all the casks to the amount of about six tons We found that they had suffered no injury while they had been in the possession of the Indians but some leathern buckets and funnels which had been taken away with the casks were not returned  The next morning I sent the boats on shore  with a guard to fill some more casks with water and soon after the people were on shore the same old man who had come over the river to them the first day came again to the farther side of it where he made a long speech and then crossed the water When he came up to the waterers the officer shewed him the stones that were piled up like cannon balls upon the shore and had been brought thither since our first landing and some of the bags that had been taken out of the canoes which I had ordered to be destroyed filled with stones and endeavoured to make him understand that the Indians had been the aggressors and that the mischief we had done them was in our own defence The old man seemed to apprehend his meaning but not to admit it he immediately made a speech to the people pointing to the stones slings and bags with great emotion and sometimes his looks gestures and voice were so furious as to be frightful His passions however subsided by degrees and the officer who to his great regret could not understand one  word of all that he had said endeavoured to convince him  by all the signs he could devise that we wished to live in friendship with them and were disposed to shew them every mark of kindness in our power He then shook hands with him and embraced him giving him at the same time several such trinkets as he thought would be most acceptable He contrived also to make the old man understand that we wished to traffick for provisions that the Indians should not come down in great numbers and that they should keep on one side of the river and we on the other After this the old man went away with great appearance of satisfaction and before noon a trade was established which furnished us with hogs fowls and fruit in great abundance so that all the ship's company whether sick or well had as much as they could use  CHAP VI  The Sick sent on Shore and a regular Trade established with the Natives some Account of their Character and Manners of their Visits on board the Ship and a Variety of Incidents that happened during this Intercourse  MATTERS being thus happily settled  I sent the Surgeon with the Second Lieutenant to examine the country and fix upon some place where the sick might take up their residence on shore When they returned they said that with respect to health and convenience all the places that they had seen upon the island seemed to be equally proper but that with respect to safety they could recommend none but the wateringplace as they would be there under the protection of the ship and the guard and would easily be prevented from straggling into the country and brought off to their meals To the wateringplace therefore I sent them with those that were employed in filling the casks and appointed the gunner to command the party that was to be their guard A tent was erected for them as a shelter both from the sun and the rain and the Surgeon was sent to superintend their conduct and give his advice if it should be wanted It happened that walking out with his gun after he had seen the sick properly disposed of in the tent a wild duck flew over his head which he shot and it fell dead among some of the natives who were on the other side of the river This threw them into a panic and  they all ran away  when they got to some distance they stopped and he made signs to them to bring the duck over this one of them at last ventured to do and pale and trembling laid it down at his feet Several other ducks happening at the instant to fly over the spot where they were standing he fired again and fortunately brought down three more This incident gave the natives such a dread of a gun that if a musquet was pointed at a thousand of them they would all run away like a flock of sheep and probably the ease with which they were afterwards kept at a distance and their orderly behaviour in their traffick was in a great measure owing to their having upon this occasion seen the instrument of which before they had only felt the effects  As I foresaw that a private traffick would probably commence between such of our people as were on shore and the natives and that if it was left to their own caprice perpetual quarrels and mischief would ensue I ordered that all matters of traffick should be transacted by the gunner on behalf of both parties and I directed him to see that no injury was done to the natives either by violence or fraud and by all possible means to attach the old man to his interest This service he performed with great diligence and fidelity nor did he neglect to complain of those who transgressed my orders which was of infinite advantage to all parties for as I punished the first offenders with a necessary severity many irregularities that would otherwise have produced the most disagreeable consequences were prevented we were also indebted for many advantages to the old man whose caution kept our people perpetually upon their guard and soon brought back those who straggled from the party The natives would indeed sometimes pilfer but by the terror of a gun without using it he always found means to make them bring back what was stolen A fellow had one day the  dexterity and address to cross the river unperceived  and steal a hatchet the gunner as soon as he missed it made the old man understand what had happened and got his party ready as if he would have gone into the woods after the thief the old man however made signs that he would save him the trouble and immediately setting off returned in a very short time with the hatchet The gunner then insisted that the offender should be delivered up and with this also the old man though not without great reluctance complied When the fellow was brought down the gunner knew him to be an old offender and therefore sent him prisoner on board I had no intention to punish him otherwise than by the fear of punishment and therefore after great entreaty and intercession I gave him his liberty and sent him on shore When the natives saw him return in safety it is hard to say whether their astonishment or joy was greatest they received him with universal acclamations and immediately carried him off into the woods the next day however he returned and as a propitiation to the gunner he brought him a considerable quantity of breadfruit and a large hog ready roasted  At this time the people on board were employed in caulking and painting the weatherwork overhauling the rigging stowing the hold and doing other necessary business but my disorder which was a bilious cholic increased so much that this day I was obliged to take to my bed my First Lieutenant also still continued very ill and the Purser was incapable of his duty The whole command devolved upon Mr Furneaux the Second Lieutenant to whom I gave general directions and recommended a particular attention to the people on shore I also ordered that fruit and fresh provisions should be served to the ship's company as long as they could be procured and that the boats should never be  absent from the ship after sunset  These directions were fulfilled with such prudence and punctuality that during all my sickness I was not troubled with any business nor had the mortification to hear a single complaint or appeal The men were constantly served with fresh pork fowls and fruit in such plenty that when I left my bed after having been confined to it near a fortnight my ship's company looked so fresh and healthy that I could scarcely believe them to be the same people  Sunday the th was marked by no incident  but on Monday the th  one of the gunner's party found a piece of saltpetre near as big as an egg As this was an object of equal curiosity and importance diligent enquiry was immediately made from whence it came The surgeon asked every one of the people on shore separately whether he had brought it from the ship every one on board also was asked whether he had carried it on shore but all declared that they had never had such a thing in their possession Application was then made to the natives but the meaning of both parties was so imperfectly conveyed by signs that nothing could be learnt of them about it during our whole stay here however we saw no more than this one piece  While the gunner was trafficking for provisions on shore we sometimes hauled the seine but we caught no fish we also frequently crawled but with no better success the disappointment however was not felt for the produce of the island enabled our people to "fare sumptuously every day"  All matters continued in the same situation till the d of July when our old man being absent  the supply of fresh provisions and fruit fell short we had however enough to  serve most of the messes reserving plenty for the sick and convalescent  On the d  we heeled the ship and looked at her bottom which we found as clean as when she came out of dock and to our great satisfaction as sound During all this time none of the natives came near our boats or the ship in their canoes This day about noon we caught a very large shark and when the boats went to fetch the people on board to dinner we sent it on shore When the boats were putting off again the gunner seeing some of the natives on the other side of the river beckoned them to come over they immediately complied and he gave them the shark which they soon cut to pieces and carried away with great appearance of satisfaction  On Sunday the th  the old man returned to the markettent and made the gunner understand that he had been up the country to prevail upon the people to bring down their hogs poultry and fruit of which the parts near the wateringplace were now nearly exhausted The good effects of his expedition soon appeared for several Indians whom our people had never seen before came in with some hogs that were larger than any that had been yet brought to market In the mean time the old man ventured off in his canoe to the ship and brought with him as a present to me a hog ready roasted I was much pleased with his attention and liberality and gave him in return for his hog an iron pot a lookingglass a drinkingglass and several other things which no man in the island was in possession of but himself  While our people were on shore several young women were permitted to cross the river who though they were not averse to the granting of personal favours knew the  value of them too well not to stipulate for a consideration  the price indeed was not great yet it was such as our men were not always able to pay and under this temptation they stole nails and other iron from the ship The nails that we brought for traffick were not always in their reach and therefore they drew several out of different parts of the vessel particularly those that fastened the cleats to the ship's side This was productive of a double mischief damage to the ship and a considerable rise at market When the gunner offered as usual small nails for hogs of a middling size the natives refused to take them and produced large spikes intimating that they expected such nails as these A most diligent enquiry was set on foot to discover the offenders but all to no purpose and though a large reward was offered to procure intelligence none was obtained I was mortified at the disappointment but I was still more mortified at a fraud which I found some of our people had practised upon the natives When no nails were to be procured they had stolen lead and cut it up in the shape of nails Many of the natives who had been paid with this base money brought their leaden nails with great simplicity to the gunner and requested him to give them iron in their stead With this request however reasonable he could not comply because by rendering lead current it would have encouraged the stealing it and the market would have been as effectually spoiled by those who could not procure nails as by those who could it was therefore necessary upon every account to render this leaden currency of no value though for our honour I should have been glad to have called it in  On Tuesday the th  I sent one of the mates with thirty men to a village at a little distance from the market hoping  that refreshments might there be bought at the original price  but here they were obliged to give still more than at the waterside In the mean time being this day able to get up for the first time and the weather being fine I went into a boat and rowed about four miles down the coast I found the country populous and pleasant in the highest degree and saw many canoes on the shore but not one came off to us nor did the people seem to take the least notice of us as we passed along About noon I returned to the ship  The commerce which our men had found means to establish with the women of the island rendered them much less obedient to the orders that had been given for the regulation of their conduct on shore than they were at first I found it necessary therefore to read the articles of war and I punished James Proctor the corporal of marines who had not only quitted his station and insulted the officer but struck the Master at Arms such a blow as brought him to the ground  The next day  I sent a party up the country to cut wood and they met with some of the natives who treated them with great kindness and hospitality Several of these friendly Indians came on board in our boat and seemed both by their dress and behaviour to be of a superior rank To these people I paid a particular attention and to discover what present would most gratify them I laid down before them a Johannes a guinea a crown piece a Spanish dollar a few shillings some new halfpence and two large nails making signs that they should take what they liked best The nails were first seized with great eagerness and then a few of the halfpence but the silver and gold lay neglected Having presented them therefore with some nails and halfpence I sent them on shore superlatively happy  From this time our market was very ill supplied  the Indians refusing to sell provisions at the usual price and making signs for large nails It was now thought necessary to look more diligently about the ship to discover what nails had been drawn and it was soon found that all the belaying cleats had been ripped off and that there was scarcely one of the hammock nails left All hands were now ordered up and I practised every artifice I could think of to discover the thieves but without success I then told them that till the thieves were discovered not a single man should go on shore this however produced no effect except that Proctor the corporal behaved in a mutinous manner for which he was instantly punished  On Saturday the th  in the afternoon the gunner came on board with a tall woman who seemed to be about five and forty years of age of a pleasing countenance and majestic deportment He told me that she was but just come into that part of the country and that seeing great respect paid her by the rest of the natives he had made her some presents in return for which she had invited him to her house which was about two miles up the valley and given him some large hogs after which she returned with him to the wateringplace and expressed a desire to go on board the ship in which he had thought it proper on all accounts that she should be gratified She seemed to be under no restraint either from diffidence or fear when she first came into the ship and she behaved all the while she was on board with an easy freedom that always distinguishes conscious superiority and habitual command I gave her a large blue mantle that reached from her shoulders to her feet which I threw over her and tied on with ribands I gave her also a lookingglass beads of several sorts and many other things of which she accepted with a very good  grace  and much pleasure She took notice that I had been ill and pointed to the shore I understood that she meant I should go thither to perfect my recovery and I made signs that I would go thither the next morning When she intimated an inclination to return I ordered the gunner to go with her who having set her on shore attended her to her habitation which he described as being very large and well built He said that in this house she had many guards and domesticks and that she had another at a little distance which was enclosed in latticework  The next morning I went on shore for the first time  and my princess or rather queen for such by her authority she appeared to be soon after came to me followed by many of her attendants As she perceived that my disorder had left me very weak she ordered her people to take me in their arms and carry me not only over the river but all the way to her house and observing that some of the people who were with me particularly the First Lieutenant and Purser had also been sick she caused them also to be carried in the same manner and a guard which I had ordered out upon the occasion followed In our way a vast multitude crouded about us but upon her waving her hand without speaking a word they withdrew and left us a free passage When we approached near her house a great number of both sexes came out to meet her these she presented to me after having intimated by signs that they were her relations and taking hold of my hand she made them kiss it We then entered the house which covered a piece of ground feet long and feet broad It consisted of a roof thatched with palm leaves and raised upon pillars on each side and in the middle The ridge of the thatch on the inside was feet high and the sides of the house to the edge of the roof were feet high all below the  N  o    roof being open As soon as we entered the house  she made us sit down and then calling four young girls she assisted them to take off my shoes draw down my stockings and pull off my coat and then directed them to smooth down the skin and gently chafe it with their hands the same operation was also performed upon the First Lieutenant and the Purser but upon none of those who appeared to be in health While this was doing our Surgeon who had walked till he was very warm took off his wig to cool and refresh himself a sudden exclamation of one of the Indians who saw it drew the attention of the rest and in a moment every eye was fixed upon the prodigy and every operation was suspended the whole assembly stood some time motionless in silent astonishment which could not have been more strongly expressed if they had discovered that our friend's limbs had been screwed on to the trunk in a short time however the young women who were chafing us resumed their employment and having continued it for about half an hour they dressed us again but in this they were as may easily be imagined very aukward I found great benefit however from the chafing and so did the Lieutenant and Purser After a little time our generous benefactress ordered some bales of Indian cloth to be brought out with which she clothed me and all that were with me according to the fashion of the country At first I declined the acceptance of this favour but being unwilling not to seem pleased with what was intended to please me I acquiesced When we went away she ordered a very large sow big with young to be taken down to the boat and accompanied us thither herself She had given directions to her people to carry me as they had done when I came but as I chose rather to walk she took me by the arm and whenever we came to a plash of water or dirt she lifted me over with as  little trouble as it would have cost me to have lifted over a child if I had been well  The next morning I sent her by the gunner  six hatchets six billhooks and several other things and when he returned he told me that he found her giving an entertainment to a great number of people which he supposed could not be less than a thousand The messes were all brought to her by the servants that prepared them the meat being put into the shells of cocoa nuts and the shells into wooden trays somewhat like those used by our butchers and she distributed them with her own hands to the guests who were seated in rows round the great house When this was done she sat down herself upon a place somewhat elevated above the rest and two women placing themselves one on each side of her fed her she opening her mouth as they brought their hands up with the food When she saw the gunner she ordered a mess for him he could not certainly tell what it was but he believed it to be fowl picked small with apples cut among it and seasoned with salt water it was however very well tasted She accepted the things that I sent her and seemed to be much pleased with them After this correspondence was established with the queen provisions of every kind became much more plenty at market but though fowls and hogs were every day brought in we were still obliged to pay more for them than at the first the market having been spoiled by the nails which our men had stolen and given to the women I therefore gave orders that every man should be searched before he went on shore and that no woman should be suffered to cross the river  On the th  the gunner being on shore to trade perceived an old woman on the other side of the river weeping  bitterly  when she saw that she had drawn his attention upon her she sent a young man who stood by her over the river to him with a branch of the plantain tree in his hand When he came up he made a long speech and then laid down his bough at the gunner's feet after this he went back and brought over the old woman another man at the same time bringing over two large fat hogs The woman looked round upon our people with great attention fixing her eyes sometimes upon one and sometimes upon another and at last burst into tears The young man who brought her over the river perceiving the gunner's concern and astonishment made another speech longer than the first still however the woman's distress was a mystery but at length she made him understand that her husband and three of her sons had been killed in the attack of the ship During this explanation she was to affected that at last she sunk down unable to speak and the two young men who endeavoured to support her appeared to be nearly in the same condition they were probably two more of her sons or some very near relations The gunner did all in his power to sooth and comfort her and when she had in some measure recovered her recollection she ordered the two hogs to be delivered to him and gave him her hand in token of friendship but would accept nothing in return though he offered her ten times as much as would have purchased the hogs at market  The next morning I sent the Second Lieutenant  with all the boats and sixty men to the westward to look at the country and try what was to be got About noon he returned having marched along the shore near six miles He found the country very pleasant and populous and abounding as well with hogs and fowls as fruit and other vegetables of various kinds The inhabitants offered him no molestation  but did not seem willing to part with any of the provisions which our people were most desirous to purchase  they gave them however a few cocoanuts and plantains and at length sold them nine hogs and a few fowls The Lieutenant was of opinion that they might be brought to trade freely by degrees but the distance from the ship was so great that too many men would be necessary for a guard He saw a great number of very large canoes upon the beach and some that were building He observed that all their tools were made of stone shells and bone and very justly inferred that they had no metal of any kind He found no quadrupeds among them besides hogs and dogs nor any earthen vessel so that all their food is either baked or roasted Having no vessel in which water could be subjected to the action of fire they had no more idea that it could be made hot than that it could be made solid As the queen was one morning at breakfast with us on board the ship one of her attendants a man of some note and one of those that we thought were priests saw the Surgeon fill the teapot by turning the cock of an urn that stood upon the table having remarked this with great curiosity and attention he presently turned the cock and received the water upon his hand as soon as he felt himself scalded he roared out and began to dance about the cabbin with the most extravagant and ridiculous expressions of pain and astonishment the other Indians not being able to conceive what was the matter with him stood staring at him in amaze and not without some mixture of terror The Surgeon however who had innocently been the cause of the mischief applied a remedy though it was some time before the poor fellow was easy  On Thursday the th  Mr Furneaux my Second Lieutenant was taken very ill which distressed me greatly as  the First Lieutenant was not yet recovered  and I was still in a very weak state myself I was this day also obliged once more to punish Proctor the corporal of marines for mutinous behaviour The queen had now been absent several days but the natives made us understand by signs that the next day she would be with us again  Accordingly the next morning she came down to the beach and soon after a great number of people  whom we had never seen before brought to market provisions of every kind and the gunner sent off fourteen hogs and fruit in great plenty  In the afternoon of the next day  the queen came on board with a present of two large hogs for she never condescended to barter and in the evening she returned on shore I sent a present with her by the Master and as soon as they landed she took him by the hand and having made a long speech to she people that flocked round them she led him to her house where she clothed him as she had before done me according to the fashion of the country  The next morning  he sent off a greater quantity of stock than we had ever procured in one day before it consisted of fortyeight hogs and pigs four dozen of fowls with breadfruit bananas apples and cocoanuts almost without number  On the th we continued to trade with good success  but in the afternoon it was discovered that Francis Pinckney one of the seamen had drawn the cleats to which the main sheet was belayed and after stealing the spikes thrown them over board Having secured the offender I called all the people together upon the deck and after taking some pains to explain his crime with all its aggravations I ordered that he should be whipped with nettles while he ran  the gauntlet thrice round the deck  my rhetoric however had very little effect for most of the crew being equally criminal with himself he was handled so tenderly that others were rather encouraged to repeat the offence by the hope of impunity than deterred by the fear of punishment To preserve the ship therefore from being pulled to pieces and the price of refreshments from being raised so high as soon to exhaust our articles of trade I ordered that no man except the wooders and waterers with their guard should be permitted to go on shore  On the st  the queen came again on board and brought several large hogs as a present for which as usual she would accept of no return When she was about to leave the ship she expressed a desire that I should go on shore with her to which I consented taking several of the officers with me When we arrived at her house she made us all sit down and taking off my hat she tied to it a bunch or tuft of feathers of various colours such as I had seen no person on shore wear but herself which produced by no means a disagreeable effect She also tied round my hat and the hats of those who were with me wreaths of braided or plaited hair and gave us to understand that both the hair and workmanship were her own she also presented us with some matts that were very curiously wrought In the evening she accompanied us back to the beach and when we were getting into the boat she put on board a fine large sow big with young and a great quantity of fruit As we were parting I made signs that I should quit the island in seven days she immediately comprehended my meaning and made signs that I should stay twenty days that I should go two days journey into the country stay there a few days bring down plenty of hogs and poultry and after that leave the island I again made signs that I must go in seven days  upon which she burst into tears and it was not without great difficulty that she was pacified  The next morning  the gunner sent off no less than twenty hogs with great plenty of fruit Our decks were now quite full of hogs and poultry of which we killed only the small ones and kept the others for sea stores we found however to our great mortification that neither the fowls nor the hogs could without great difficulty be brought to eat any thing but fruit which made it necessary to kill them faster than we should otherwise have done two however a boar and a sow were brought alive to England of which I made a present to Mr Stephens Secretary to the Admiralty the sow afterwards died in pigging but the boar is still alive  On the d we had very heavy rain  with a storm of wind that blew down several trees on shore though very little of it was felt where the ship lay  The next day I sent the old man  who had been of great service to the gunner at the markettent another iron pot some hatchets and bills and a piece of cloth I also sent the queen two turkies two geese three Guinea hens a cat big with kitten some china lookingglasses glass bottles shirts needles thread cloth ribands peas some small white kidney beans called callivances and about sixteen different sorts of garden seeds and a shovel besides a considerable quantity of cutlery wares consisting of knives scissars billhooks and other things We had already planted several sorts of the garden seeds and some peas in several places and had the pleasure to see them come up in a very flourishing state yet there were no remains of them when Captain Cook left the island I sent her also two iron pots and a few spoons In return for these things the gunner brought off eighteen hogs and some fruit  In the morning of the th  I ordered Mr Gore one of the mates with all the marines forty seamen and four midshipmen to go up the valley by the river as high as they could and examine the soil and produce of the country noting the trees and plants which they should find and when they saw any stream from the mountains to trace it to its source and observe whether it was tinctured with any mineral or ore I cautioned them also to keep continually upon their guard against the natives and directed them to make a fire as a signal if they should be attacked At the same time I took a guard on shore and erected a tent on a point of land to observe an eclipse of the sun which the morning being very clear was done with great accuracy     Hours  Min  Seconds  The immersion began by true time at        The emersion by true time was at        The duration of the eclipse was        The latitude of the point on which the observation was made was ° ′ S the sun's declination was ° ′ N and the variation of the needle ° ′ E  After the observation was taken I went to the queen's house and shewed her the telescope which was a reflector After she had admired its structure I endeavoured to make her comprehend its use and fixing it so as to command several distant objects with which she was well acquainted but which could not be distinguished with the naked eye I made her look through it As soon as the saw them she started back with astonishment and directing her eye as the glass was pointed stood some time motionless and silent she then looked through the glass again and again sought in vain with the naked eye for the objects which it discovered As they by turns vanished and reappeared her  countenance and gestures expressed a mixture of wonder and delight which no language can describe  When the glass was removed I invited her and several of the Chiefs that were with her to go with me on board the ship in which I had a view to the security of the party that I had sent out for I thought that while the queen and the principal people were known to be in my power nothing would be attempted against any person belonging to the ship on shore When we got on board I ordered a good dinner for their entertainment but the queen would neither eat nor drink the people that were with her eat very heartily of whatever was set before them but would drink only plain water  In the evening our people returned from their excursion and came down to the beach upon which I put the queen and her attendants into the boats and sent them on shore As she was going over the ship's side she asked by signs whether I still persisted in my resolution of leaving the island at the time I had fixed and when I made her understand that it was impossible I should stay longer she expressed her regret by a flood of tears which for a while took away her speech As soon as her passion subsided she told me that she would come on board again the next day and thus we parted  CHAP VII  An Account of an Expedition to discover the inland Part of the Country and our other Transactions till we quitted the Island to continue our Voyage  AFTER the mate came on board  he gave me a written account of his expedition to the following effect  "At four o'clock in the morning of Saturday the th of June I landed with four midshipmen a serjeant and twelve marines and twentyfour seamen all armed besides four who carried hatchets and other articles of traffick and four who were loaded with ammunition and provisions the rest being left with the boat every man had his day's allowance of brandy and the hatchet men two small kegs to give out when I should think proper  "As soon as I got on shore I called upon our old man and took him with us we then followed the course of the river in two parties one marching on each side For the first two miles it flowed through a valley of considerable width in which were many habitations with gardens walled in and abundance of hogs poultry and fruit the soil here seemed to be a rich fat earth and was of a blackish colour After this the valley became very narrow and the ground rising abruptly on one side of the river we were all obliged to march on the other Where the stream was precipitated from the hills channels had been cut to lead the water into gardens and plantations of fruit trees in these gardens we found an herb which had never been brought down to the  waterside and which we perceived the inhabitants eat raw  I tasted it and found it pleasant its flavour somewhat resembling that of the West Indian spinnage called  Calleloor  though its leaf was very different The ground was fenced off so as to make a very pretty appearance the breadfruit and apple trees were planted in rows on the declivity of the hills and the cocoa nut and plantain which require more moisture on the level ground under the trees both on the sides and at the foot of the hills there was very good grass but no underwood As we advanced the windings of the stream became innumerable the hills on each side swelled into mountains and vast crags every where projected over our heads Travelling now became difficult and when we had proceeded about four miles the road for the last mile having been very bad we sat down to rest ourselves and take the refreshment of our breakfast we ranged ourselves upon the ground under a large apple tree in a very pleasant spot but just as we were about to begin our repast we were suddenly alarmed by a confused sound of many voices and a great shouting and presently afterwards saw a multitude of men women and children upon the hill above us our old man seeing us rise hastily and look to our arms beckoned to us to sit still and immediately went up to the people that had surprised us As soon as he joined them they were silent and soon after disappeared in a short time however they returned and brought with them a large hog ready roasted with plenty of breadfruit yams and other refreshments which they gave to the old man who distributed them among our people In return for this treat I gave them some nails buttons and other things with which they were greatly delighted After this we proceeded up the valley as far as we could searching all the runs of water and all the places where water had run for  appearances of metal or ore  but could find none except what I have brought back with me I shewed all the people that we met with the piece of saltpetre which had been picked up in the island and which I had taken with me for that purpose but none of them took any notice of it nor could I learn from them any thing about it The old man began now to be weary and there being a mountain before us he made signs that he would go home before he left us however he made the people who had so liberally supplied us with provisions take the baggage with the fruit that had not been eaten and some cocoa nutshells full of fresh water and made signs that they should follow us up the side of the mountain As soon as he was gone they gathered green branches from the neighbouring trees and with many ceremonies of which we did not know the meaning laid them down before us after this they took some small berries with which they painted themselves red and the bark of a tree that contained a yellow juice with which they stained their garments in different parts We began to climb the mountain while our old man was still in sight and he perceiving that we made our way with difficulty through the weeds and brushwood which grew very thick turned back and said something to the natives in a firm loud tone upon which twenty or thirty of the men went before us and cleared us a very good path they also refreshed us with water and fruit as we went along and assisted us to climb the most difficult places which we should otherwise have found altogether impracticable We began to ascend this hill at the distance of about six miles from the place where we landed and I reckoned the top of it to be near a mile above the river that runs through the valley below When we arrived at the summit we again sat down to rest and refresh ourselves While we were  climbing we flattered ourselves that from the top we should command the whole island  but we now saw mountains before us so much higher than our situation that with respect to them we appeared to be in a valley towards the ship indeed the view was enchanting the sides of the hills were beautifully clothed with wood villages were every where interspersed and the vallies between them afforded a still richer prospect the houses stood thicker and the verdure was more luxuriant We saw very few habitations above us but discovered smoke in many places ascending from between the highest hills that were in sight and therefore I conjecture that the most elevated parts of the country are by no means without inhabitants As we ascended the mountain we saw many springs gush from fissures on the side of it and when we had reached the summit we found many houses that we did not discover as we passed them No part of these mountains is naked the summits of the highest that we could see were crowned with wood but of what kind I know not those that were of the same height with that which we had climbed were woody on the sides but on the summit were rocky and covered with fern Upon the flats that appeared below these there grew a sedgy kind of grass and weeds in general the soil here as well as in the valley seemed to be rich We saw several bushes of sugarcane which was very large and very good growing wild without the least culture I likewise found ginger and turmerick and have brought samples of both but could not procure seeds of any tree most of them being in blossom After traversing the top of this mountain to a good distance I found a tree exactly like a fern except that it was or feet high This tree I cut down and found the inside of it also like a fern I would have brought a piece of it with me but found it too cumbersome and I knew not  what difficulties we might meet with before we got back to the ship  which we judged to be now at a great distance After having again recruited our strength by refreshment and rest we began to descend the mountain being still attended by the people to whose care we had been recommended by our old man We kept our general direction towards the ship but sometimes deviated a little to the right and left in the plains and vallies when we saw any houses that were pleasantly situated the inhabitants being every where ready to accommodate us with whatever they had We saw no beast except a few hogs nor any birds except parrots parroquets and green doves by the river however there was plenty of ducks and every place that was planted and cultivated appeared to flourish with great luxuriance though in the midst of what had the appearance of barren ground I planted the stones of peaches cherries and plums with a great variety of garden seeds where I thought it was most probable that they would thrive and limes lemons and oranges in situations which resembled those in which they are found in the West Indies In the afternoon we arrived at a very pleasant spot within about three miles of the ship where we procured two hogs and some fowls which the natives dressed for us very well and with great expedition Here we continued till the cool of the evening and then made the best of our way for the ship having liberally rewarded our guides and the people who had provided us so good a dinner Our men behaved through the whole day with the greatest decency and order and we parted with our Indian friends in perfect goodhumour with each other"  About o'clock  the next morning the queen came on board according to her promise with a present of hogs and fowls but went on shore again soon afterwards This day  the Gunner sent off near thirty hogs  with great plenty of fowls and fruit We completed our wood and water and got all ready for sea More inhabitants came down to the beach from the inland country than we had seen before and many of them appeared by the respect that was paid them to be of a superior rank About three o'clock in the afternoon the queen came again down to the beach very well dressed and followed by a great number of people Having crossed the river with her attendants and our old man she came once more on board the ship She brought with her some very fine fruit and renewed her solicitation that I would stay ten days longer with great earnestness intimating that she would go into the country and bring me plenty of hogs fowls and fruit I endeavoured to express a proper sense of her kindness and bounty but assured her that I should certainly sail the next morning This as usual threw her into tears and after she recovered she enquired by signs when I should return I endeavoured to express fifty days and she made signs for thirty but the sign for fifty being constantly repeated she seemed satisfied She stayed on board till night and it was then with the greatest difficulty that she could be prevailed upon to go on shore When she was told that the boat was ready she threw herself down upon the armchest and wept a long time with an excess of passion that could not be pacified at last however though with the greatest reluctance she went into the boat and was followed by her attendants and the old man The old man had often intimated that his son a lad about fourteen years of age should go with us and the boy seemed to be willing he had however now disappeared for two days I enquired after him when I first missed him and the old man gave me to understand that he was gone into the country to see his friends and would return time  enough to go with us  but I have reason to think that when the time drew near the father's courage failed and that to keep his child he secreted him till the ship was gone for we never saw him afterwards  At break of day on Monday the th  we unmoored and at the same time I sent the barge and cutter to fill the few watercasks that were now empty When they came near the shore they saw to their great surprise the whole beach covered with inhabitants and having some doubt whether it would be prudent to venture themselves among such a multitude they were about to pull back again for the ship As soon as this was perceived from the shore the queen came forward and beckoned them at the same time guessing the reason of what had happened she made the natives retire to the other side of the river the boats then proceeded to the shore and filled the casks in the mean time she put some hogs and fruit on board and when they were putting off would fain have returned with them to the ship The officer however who had received orders to bring off none of the natives would not permit her upon which she presently launched a double canoe and was rowed off by her own people Her canoe was immediately followed by fifteen or sixteen more and all of them came up to the ship The queen came on board but not being able to speak she sat down and gave vent to her passion by weeping After she had been on board about an hour a breeze springing up we weighed anchor and made sail Finding it now necessary to return into her canoe she embraced us all in the most affectionate manner and with many tears all her attendants also expressed great sorrow at our departure Soon after it fell calm and I sent the boats ahead to tow upon which all the canoes returned to the ship and that which had the queen on board came up to the gunroom port where her  people made it fast  In a few minutes she came into the bow of her canoe where she sat weeping with inconsolable sorrow I gave her many things which I thought would be of great use to her and some for ornament she silently accepted of all but took little notice of any thing About o'clock we were got without the reef and a fresh breeze springing up our Indian friends and particularly the queen once more bade us farewel with such tenderness of affection and grief as filled both my heart and my eyes  At noon the harbour from which we sailed bore S E ½ E distant about twelve miles It lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° W and I gave it the name of Port Royal Harbour  CHAP VIII  A more particular Account of the Inhabitants of Otaheite and of their domestic Life Manners and Arts  HAVING lain off this if island from the th of June to the th of July  I shall now give the best account of its inhabitants with their manners and arts that I can but having been in a very bad state of health the whole time and for great part of it confined to my bed it will of necessity be much less accurate and particular than I might otherwise have made it  The inhabitants of this island are a stout wellmade active and comely people The stature of the men in general is from five feet seven to five feet ten inches though a few individuals are taller and a few shorter that of the women from five feet to five feet six The complexion of the men is tawney but those that go upon the water are much redder than those who live on shore Their hair in general is black but in some it is brown in some red and in others flaxen which is remarkable because the hair of all other natives of Asia Africa and America is black without a single exception It is generally tied up either in one bunch in the middle of the head or in two one on each side but some wear it loose and it then curls very strongly in the children of both sexes it is generally flaxen They have no combs yet their hair is very neatly dressed and those who had combs from us made good use of them It is a universal custom to anoint the head with cocoanut oil in  which a root has been scraped that smells something like roses The women are all handsome and some of them extremely beautiful Chastity does not seem to be considered as a virtue among them for they not only readily and openly trafficked with our people for personal favours but were brought down by their fathers and brothers for that purpose they were however conscious of the value of beauty and the size of the nail that was demanded for the enjoyment of the lady was always in proportion to her charms The men who came down to the side of the river at the same time that they presented the girl shewed a stick of the size of the nail that was to be her price and if our people agreed she was sent over to them for the men were not permitted to cross the river This commerce was carried on a considerable time before the officers discovered it for while some straggled a little way to receive the lady the others kept a lookout When I was acquainted with it I no longer wondered that the ship was in danger of being pulled to pieces for the nails and iron that held her together which I had before puzzled myself to account for in vain the whole ship's company having daily as much fresh provision and fruit as they could eat Both men and women are not only decently but gracefully clothed in a kind of white cloth that is made of the bark of a shrub and very much resembles coarse China paper Their dress consists of two pieces of this cloth one of them a hole having been made in the middle to put the head through hangs down from the shoulders to the midleg before and behind another piece which is between four and five yards long and about one yard broad they wrap round the body in a very easy manner This cloth is not woven but is made like paper of the macerated fibres of an inner bark spread out and beaten together Their ornaments are feathers flowers  pieces of shells and pearls the pearls are worn chiefly by the women from whom I purchased about two dozen of a small size they were of a good colour but were all spoiled by boring Mr Furneaux saw several in his excursion to the west but he could purchase none with any thing he had to offer I observed that it was here a universal custom both for men and women to have the hinder part of their thighs and loins marked very thick with black lines in various forms These marks were made by striking the teeth of an instrument somewhat like a comb just through the skin and rubbing into the punctures a kind of paste made of foot and oil which leaves an indelible stain The boys and girls under twelve years of age are not marked but we observed a few of the men whose legs were marked in chequers by the same method and they appeared to be persons of superior rank and authority One of the principal attendants upon the queen appeared much more disposed to imitate our manners than the rest and our people with whom he soon became a favourite distinguished him by the name of Jonathan This man Mr Furneaux clothed completely in an English dress and it sat very easy upon him Our officers were always carried on shore it being shoal water where we landed and Jonathan assuming new state with his new finery made some of his people carry him on shore in the same manner He very soon attempted to use a knife and fork at his meals but at first when he had stuck a morsel upon his fork and tried to feed himself with that instrument he could not guide it but by the mere force of habit his hand came to his mouth and the victuals at the end of the fork went away to his car  Their food consists of pork poultry dog's flesh and fish breadfruit bananas plantains yams apples and a four fruit which though not pleasant by itself gives an agreeable  relish to roasted breadfruit with which it is frequently beaten up They have abundance of rats but as far as I could discover these make no part of their food The river affords them good mullet but they are neither large nor in plenty They find conchs muscles and other shellfish on the reef which they gather at low water and eat raw with breadfruit before they come on shore They have also very fine crayfish and they catch with lines and hooks of mother of pearl at a little distance from the shore parrotfish groopers and many other sorts of which they are so fond that we could seldom prevail upon them to sell us a few at any price They have also nets of an enormous size with very small meshes and with these they catch abundance of small fish about the size of sardines but while they were using both nets and lines with great success we could not catch a single fish with either We procured some of their hooks and lines but for want of their art we were still disappointed  The manner in which they dress their food is this they kindle a fire by rubbing the end of one piece of dry wood upon the side of another in the same manner as our carpenters whet a chissel then they dig a pit about half a foot deep and two or three yards in circumference they pave the bottom with large pebble stones which they lay down very smooth and even and then kindle a fire in it with dry wood leaves and the husks of the cocoanut When the stones are sufficiently heated they take out the embers and rake up the ashes on every side then they cover the stones with a layer of green cocoanuttree leaves and wrap up the animal that is to be dressed in the leaves of the plantain if it is a small hog they wrap it up whole if a large one they split it When it is placed in the pit they cover it with the hot embers and lay upon them breadfruit and yams which are  also wrapped up in the leaves of the plantain over these they spread the remainder of the embers mixing among them some of the hot stones with more cocoanuttree leaves upon them and then close all up with earth so that the heat is kept in After a time proportioned to the size of what is dressing the oven is opened and the meat taken out which is tender full of gravy and in my opinion better in every respect than when it is dressed any other way Excepting the fruit they have no sauce but salt water nor any knives but shells with which they carve very dexterously always cutting from them It is impossible to describe the astonishment they expressed when they saw the Gunner who while he kept the market used to dine on shore dress his pork and poultry by boiling them in a pot having as I have before observed no vessel that would bear the fire they had no idea of hot water or its effects but from the time that the old man was in possession of an iron pot he and his friends eat boiled meat every day The iron pots which I afterwards gave to the queen and several of the Chiefs were also in constant use and brought as many people together as a monster or a puppetshow in a country fair They appeared to have no liquor for drinking but water and to be happily ignorant of the art of fermenting the juice of any vegetable so as to give it an intoxicating quality they have as has been already observed the sugarcane but they seemed to make no other use of it than to chew which they do not do habitually but only break a piece off when they happen to pass by a place where it is growing  Of their domestic life and amusements we had not sufficient opportunity to obtain much knowlege but they appear sometimes to have wars with each other not only from their weapons but the scars with which many of them were  marked and some of which appeared to be the remains of very considerable wounds made with stones bludgeons or some other obtuse weapon by these scars also they appear to be no inconsiderable proficients in surgery of which indeed we happened to have more direct evidence One of our seamen when he was on shore run a large splinter into his foot and the Surgeon being on board one of his comrades endeavoured to take it out with a penknife but after putting the poor fellow to a good deal of pain was obliged to give it over Our good old Indian who happened to be present then called over one of his countrymen that was standing on the opposite side of the river who having looked at the seaman's foot went immediately down to the beach and taking up a shell broke it to a point with his teeth with this instrument in little more than a minute he laid open the place and extracted the splinter in the mean time the old man who as soon as he had called the other over went a little way into the wood returned with some gum which he applied to the wound upon a piece of the cloth that was wrapped round him and in two days time it was perfectly healed We afterwards learned that this gum was produced by the apple tree and our Surgeon procured some of it and used it as a vulnerary balsam with great success  The habitations of these happy people I have described already and besides these we saw several sheds inclosed within a wall on the outside of which there were several uncouth figures of men women hogs and dogs carved on posts that were driven into the ground Several of the natives were from time to time seen to enter these places with a slow pace and dejected countenance from which we conjectured that they were repositories of the dead The area within the walls of these places was generally well paved  with large round stones but it appeared not to be much trodden for the grass every where grew up between them I endeavoured with particular attention to discover whether they had a religious worship among them but never could find the least traces of any  The boats or canoes of these people are of three different sorts Some are made out of a single tree and carry from two to six men these are used chiefly for fishing and we constantly saw many of them busy upon the reef some were constructed of planks very dexterously sewed together these were of different sizes and would carry from ten to forty men Two of them were generally lashed together and two masts set up between them if they were single they had an outrigger on one side and only one mast in the middle With these vessels they sail far beyond the sight of land probably to other islands and bring home plantains bananas and yams which seem also to be more plenty upon other parts of this island than that off which the ship lay A third sort seem to be intended principally for pleasure and show they are very large but have no sail and in shape resemble the gondolas of Venice the middle is covered with a large awning and some of the people sit upon it some under it None of these vessels came near the ship except on the first and second day after our arrival but we saw three or four times a week a procession of eight or ten of them passing at a distance with streamers flying and a great number of small canoes attending them while many hundreds of people ran abreast of them along the shore They generally rowed to the outward point of a reef which lay about four miles to the westward of us where they stayed about an hour and then returned These processions however are never made but in fine weather and all  the people on board are dressed though in the other canoes they have only a piece of cloth wrapped round their middle Those who rowed and steered were dressed in white those who sat upon the awning and under it in white and red and two men who were mounted on the prow of each vessel were dressed in red only We sometimes went out to observe them in our boats and though we were never nearer than a mile we saw them with our glasses as distinctly as if we had been upon the spot  The plank of which these vessels are constructed is made by splitting a tree with the grain into as many thin pieces as they can They first fell the tree with a kind of hatchet or adze made of a tough greenish kind of stone very dexterously fitted into a handle it is then cut into such lengths as are required for the plank one end of which is heated till it begins to crack and then with wedges of hard wood they split it down some of these planks are two feet broad and from to feet long The sides are smoothed with adzes of the same materials and construction but of a smaller size Six or eight men are sometimes at work upon the same plank together and as their tools presently lose their edge every man has by him a cocoa nutshell filled with water and a flat stone with which he sharpens his adze almost every minute These planks are generally brought to the thickness of about an inch and are afterwards fitted to the boat with the same exactness that would be expected from an expert joiner To fasten these planks together holes are bored with a piece of bone that is fixed into a stick for that purpose a use to which our nails were afterwards applied with great advantage and through these holes a kind of plaited cordage is passed so as to hold the planks strongly together the seams are caulked with dried rushes and the whole outside of the vessel is paid with a  gummy juice which some of their trees produce in great plenty and which is a very good succedaneum for pitch  The wood which they use for their large canoes is that of the apple tree which grows very tall and strait Several of them that we measured were near eight feet in the girth and from to to the branches with very little diminution in the size Our carpenter said that in other respects it was not a good wood for the purpose being very light The small canoes are nothing more than the hollowed trunk of the breadfruit tree which is still more light and spongy The trunk of the breadfruit tree is six feet in girth and about feet to the branches  Their principal weapons are stones thrown either with the hand or sling and bludgeons for though they have bows and arrows the arrows are only fit to knock down a bird none of them being pointed but headed only with a round stone  I did not see one turtle all the while I lay off this island but upon shewing some small ones which I brought from Queen Charlotte's Island to the inhabitants they made signs that they had them of a much larger size I very much regretted my having lost our hegoat which died soon after we left Saint Iago and that neither of our shegoats of which we had two were with kid If the hegoat had lived I would have put them all on shore at this place and I would have left a shegoat here if either of them had been with kid and I doubt not but that in a few years they would have stocked the island  The climate here appears to be very good and the island to be one of the most healthy as well as delightful spots in the world We saw no appearance of disease among the inhabitants The hills are covered with wood and the vallies  with herbage and the air in general is so pure that notwithstanding the heat our flesh meat kept very well two days and our fish one We met with no frog toad scorpion centipied or serpent of any kind and the only troublesome insects that we saw were ants of which there were but few  The southeast part of the island seems to be better cultivated and inhabited than where we lay for we saw every day boats come round from thence laden with plantains and other fruit and we always found greater plenty and a lower price soon after their arrival than before  The tide rises and falls very little and being governed by the winds is very uncertain though they generally blow from the E to the S S E and for the most part a pleasant breeze  The benefit that we received while we lay off this island with respect to the health of the ship's company was beyond our most sanguine expectations for we had not now an invalid on board except the two Lieutenants and myself and we were recovering though still in a very feeble condition  It is certain that none of our people contracted the venereal disease here and therefore as they had free commerce with great numbers of the women there is the greatest probability that it was not then known in the country It was however found here by Captain Cook in the Endeavour and as no European vessel is known to have visited this island before Captain Cook's arrival but the Dolphin and the Boudeuse and Etoil commanded by M Bougainville the reproach of having contaminated with that dreadful pest a race of happy people to whom its miseries had till then been unknown must be due either to him or to me to England or to France and I think myself happy to be able to exculpate myself and my country beyond the possibility of doubt  It is well known that the Surgeon on board his Majesty's ships keeps a list of the persons who are sick on board specifying their diseases and the times when they came under his care and when they were discharged It happened that I was once at the paytable on board a ship when several sailors objected to the payment of the Surgeon alleging that although he had discharged them from the list and reported them to be cured yet their cure was incomplete From this time it has been my constant practice when the Surgeon reported a man to be cured who had been upon the sick list to call the man before me and ask him whether the report was true if he alleged that any symptoms of his complaint remained I continued him upon the list if not I required him as a confirmation of the Surgeon's report to sign the book which was always done in my presence A copy of the sick list on board the Dolphin during this voyage signed by every man in my presence when he was discharged well in confirmation of the Surgeon's report written in my own hand and confirmed by my affidavit I have deposited in the Admiralty by which it appears that the last man on board the ship in her voyage outward who was upon the sick list for the venereal disease except one who was sent to England in the Store ship was discharged cured and signed the book on the th of December near six months before our arrival at Otaheite which was on the th of June and that the first man who was upon the list for that disease in our return home was entered on the th of February six months after we left the island which was on the th of July so that the ship's company was intirely free fourteen months within one day the very middle of which time we spent at Otaheite and the man who was first entered as a venereal patient on our return home was known to have contracted the disease at the Cape of Good Hope where we then lay

Account of several other Islands that were discovered in the South Seas  HAVING made sail from King George the Third's Island  we proceeded along the shore of the Duke of York's Island at the distance of about two miles There appeared to be good bays in every part of it and in the middle a fine harbour but I did not think it worth while to go on shore The middle and west end is very mountainous the east end is lower and the coast just within the beach is covered with cocoanut breadfruit apple and plantain trees  At daylight the next morning we saw land  for which we made sail and ran along the leeside of it On the weatherside there were very great breakers and the leeside was rocky but in many places there appeared to be good anchorage We saw but few inhabitants and they appeared to live in a manner very different from those of King George's Island their habitations being only small huts We saw many cocoanut and other trees upon the shore but all of them had their heads blown away probably in a hurricane This island is about six miles long and has a mountain of considerable height in the middle which seems to be fertile It lies in latitude ° ′ S and longitude by our last observation ° ′ W and I called it SIR CHARLES SAUNDERS's ISLAND  On the th the variation of the compass by azimuth  was ° ′ E and early the next morning at daybreak  we saw land bearing from N by E to N W We stood for it but could find no anchorage the whole island being surrounded  by breakers  We saw smoke in two places but no inhabitants A few cocoanut trees were growing on the leepart of it and I called it LORD HOW's ISLAND  It is about ten miles long and four broad and lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude by observation ° ′ W  In the afternoon we saw land bearing W by N and stood for it At five o'clock we saw breakers running a great way out to the southward and soon after low land to the S W and breakers all about it in every direction  We turned to windward all night and as soon as it was light crowded sail to get round these shoals At nine we got round them and named them SCILLY ISLANDS  They are a group of islands or shoals extremely dangerous for in the night however clear the weather and by day if it is hazey a ship may run upon them without seeing land They lie in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W  We continued to steer our course westward till daybreak on the th of August  when we saw land bearing W by S and hauled towards it At o'clock in the forenoon we saw more land in the W S W At noon the first land that we saw which proved to be an island bore W ½ S distant about five leagues and had the appearance of a sugar loaf the middle of the other land which was also an island and appeared in a peak bore W S W distant six leagues To the first which is nearly circular and three miles over I gave the name of BOSCAWEN's ISLAND  and the other which is three miles and a half long and two broad I called KEPPEL's ISLE  Port Royal at this time bore E ° ′ S distant leagues  At two o'clock being about two miles distant from Boscawen's Island we saw several of the inhabitants but Keppel's Isle being to windward and appearing more likely to afford us anchorage we hauled up for it At six it was not  more than a mile and an half distant and with our glasses  we saw many of the inhabitants upon the beach but there being breakers at a considerable distance from the shore we stood off and on all night  At four o'clock the next morning  we sent off the boats to sound and visit the island and as soon as it was light we ran down and lay overagainst the middle of it At noon the boats returned and reported that they had run within a cable's length of the island but could find no ground that seeing a reef of rocks lie off it they had hauled round it and got into a large deep bay which was full of rocks that they then sounded without the bay and found anchorage from to fathom with a bottom of sand and coral that afterwards they went again into the bay and found a rivulet of good water but the shore being rocky went in search of a better landingplace which they found about half a mile farther and went ashore They reported also that from the water to this landingplace a good rollingway might be made for supplying the ship but that a strong guard would be necessary to prevent molestation from the inhabitants They saw no hogs but brought off two fowls and some cocoanuts plantains and bananas While the boats were on shore two canoes came up to them with six men they seemed to be peaceably inclined and were much the same kind of people as the inhabitants of King George's Island but they were clothed in a kind of matting and the first joint of their little fingers had been taken off at the same time about fifty more came down from the country to within about an hundred yards of them but would advance no farther When our people had made what observations they could they put off and three of the natives from the canoes came into one of the boats but when she got about half a mile from the shore they all suddenly jumped overboard and swam back again  Having received this account  I considered that the watering here would be tedious and attended with great fatigue that it was now the depth of winter in the southern hemisphere that the ship was leaky that the rudder shook the stern very much and that what other damage she might have received in her bottom could not be known That for these reasons she was very unfit for the bad weather which she would certainly meet with either in going round Cape Horn or through the Streight of Magellan that if she should get safely through the Streight or round the Cape it would be absolutely necessary for her to refresh in some port but in that case no port would be in her reach I therefore determined to make the best of my way to Tinian Batavia and so to Europe by the Cape of Good Hope By this rout as far as we could judge we should sooner be at home and if the ship should prove not to be in a condition to make the whole voyage we should still save our lives as from this place to Batavia we should probably have a calm sea and be not far from as port  In consequence of this resolution at noon I bore away and passed Boscawen's Island without visiting it It is a high round island abounding in wood and full of people but Keppel's Isle is by far the largest and the best of the two  Boscawen's Island lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° W and Keppel's Isle in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W  We continued a W N W course till o'clock in the morning of Sunday the th  when we saw land bearing N by E and hauled up for it At noon we were within three leagues of it the land within shore appeared to be high but at the waterside it was low and had a pleasant appearance the whole seemed to be surrounded by reefs that ran two or three miles into the sea As we sailed along the shore which was covered with cocoanut trees  map  we saw a few huts  and smoke in several parts up the country Soon after we hauled without a reef of rocks to get round the leeside of the island and at the same time sent out the boats to sound and examine the coast  The boats rowed close along the shore and found it rocky with trees growing close down to the waterside These trees were of different sorts many of them very large but had no fruit on the leeside however there were a few cocoanuts but not a single habitation was to be seen They discovered several small rills of water which by clearing might have been made to run in a larger stream Soon after they had got close to the shore several canoes came up to them each having six or eight men on board They appeared to be a robust active people and were quite naked except a kind of mat that was wrapped round their middle They were armed with large maces or clubs such as Hercules is represented with two of which they sold to the Master for a nail or two and some trinkets As our people had seen no animal either bird or beast except seafowl they were very desirous to learn of the natives whether they had either but could not make themselves understood It appears that during this conference a design was formed to seize our cutter for one of the Indians suddenly laid hold of her painter and hauled her upon the rocks Our people endeavoured in vain to make them desist till they fired a musket cross the nose of the man that was most active in the mischief No hurt was done but the fire and report so affrighted them that they made off with great precipitation Both our boats then put off but the water had fallen so suddenly that they found it very difficult to get back to the ship for when they came into deep water they found the points of rocks standing up and the whole reef except in one part was now dry and a great sea broke over it The Indians probably perceived their distress for they turned back and  followed them in their canoes all along the reef till they got to the breach  and then seeing them clear and making way fast towards the ship they returned  About six in the evening it being then dark the boats returned and the Master told me that all within the reef was rocky but that in two or three places at about two cables' length without it there was anchorage in and fathom upon sand and coral The breach in the reef he found to be about fathom broad and here if pressed by necessity he said a ship might anchor or moor in fathom but that it would not be safe to moor with a greater length than half a cable  When I had hoisted the boats in I ran down four miles to leeward where we lay till the morning and then finding that the current had set us out of sight of the island I made sail The officers did me the honour to call this island after my name  WALLIS's ISLAND lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° W  As the latitudes and longitudes of all these islands are accurately laid down and plans of them delivered in to the Admiralty it will be easy for any ship that shall hereafter navigate these seas to find any of them either to refresh or to make farther discoveries of their produce  I thought it very remarkable that although we found no kind of metal in any of these islands yet the inhabitants of all of them the moment they got a piece of iron in their possession began to sharpen it but made no such attempt on brass or copper  We continued to steer N westerly and many birds were from time to time seen about the ship till the th  when her longitude being by observation ° ′ W we crossed the line into North latitude Among the birds that came about the ship one which we caught exactly resembled a dove in size shape and colour It had red legs  WALLIS's ISLANDS  map  and was webfooted We also saw several plantain leaves and cocoanuts pass by the ship  On Saturday the th  about two o'clock in the afternoon being in latitude ° ′ N longitude ° W we crossed a great rippling which stretched from the N E to the S W as far as the eye could reach from the masthead We sounded but had no bottom with a line of two hundred fathoms  On Thursday the d of September  at five o'clock in the morning we saw land bearing E N E distant about five miles in about half an hour we saw more land in the N W and at six saw in the N E an Indian proa such as is described in the account of Lord Anson's voyage Perceiving that she stood towards us we hoisted Spanish colours but when she came within about two miles of us she tacked and stood from us to the N N W and in a short time was out of sight  At eight o'clock the islands which I judged to be two of the Piscadores bore from S W by W to W and to windward from N by E to N E and had the appearance of small flat keys They were distant about three leagues but many others much farther off were in sight The latitude of one of those islands is ° N longitude ° ′ W and the other ° ′ N longitude ° ′ W  On the th we saw a curlieu and a pewit  and on the th we caught a landbird very much resembling a starling  On the th we saw two gannets  and judged the island of Tinian to bear West at about one and thirty leagues distance our latitude being ° N and our longitude ° ′ W At six o'clock the next morning  we saw the island of Saypan bearing W by N distant about ten leagues In  the afternoon  we saw Tinian and made sail for the road where at nine o'clock in the morning of Saturday the th we came to an anchor in two and twenty fathom sandy ground at about a mile distant from the shore and half a mile from the reef  CHAP XI  Some Account of the present State of the Island of Tinian and our Employment there with what happened in the Run from thence to Batavia  AS soon as the ship was secured I sent the boats on shore to erect tents and bring off some refreshments and about noon they returned with some cocoanuts limes and oranges  In the evening the tents being erected I sent the Surgeon and all the invalids on shore with two months provisions of every kind for forty men the smith's forge and a chest of carpenter's tools I then landed myself with the First Lieutenant both of us being in a very sickly condition taking with us also a mate and twelve men to go up the country and hunt for cattle  When we first came to an anchor  the North part of the bay bore N ° W Cocoa Point N ° W the landingplace NE by N and the south end of the island S ° E but next morning the Master having sounded all the bay and being of opinion that there was a better situation to the southward we warped the ship a little way up and moored with a cable each way  At six in the evening  the hunters brought in a fine young bull of near four hundred weight part of it we kept on shore and sent the rest on board with breadfruit limes and oranges  Early the next morning  the carpenters were set at work to caulk the ship all over and put every thing in repair as far as possible All the sails were also got on shore and the sailmakers employed to mend them the armourers at the same time were busy in repairing the ironwork and making new chains for the rudder The number of people now on shore sick and well was fiftythree  In this place we got beef pork poultry papaw apples breadfruit limes oranges and every refreshment that is mentioned in the account of Lord Anson's voyage The sick began to recover from the day they first went on shore the air however was so different here from what we found it in King George's Island that flesh meat which there kept sweet two days could here be scarcely kept sweet one There had been many cocoanut trees near the landingplace but they had been all wastefully cut down for the fruit and none being grown up in their stead we were forced to go three miles into the country before a single nut could be procured The hunters also suffered incredible fatigue for they were frequently obliged to go ten or twelve miles through one continued thicket and the cattle were so wild that it was very difficult to come near them so that I was obliged to relieve one party by another and it being reported that cattle were more plenty at the North end of the island but that the hunters being quite exhausted with fatigue when they got thither were not able to kill them much less to bring them down I sent Mr Gore with fourteen men to establish themselves in that part of the island and ordered that a boat should go every morning at daybreak to bring in what  they should kill  In the mean time the ship was laid by the stern to get at some of the copper sheathing which had been much torn and in repairing the copper the carpenter discovered and stopped a large leak under the lining of the knee of the head by which we had reason to hope most of the water that the vessel had lately admitted in bad weather came in During our stay here I ordered all the people on shore by turns  and by the th of October all the sick being recovered our wood and water completed and the ship made fit for the sea we got every thing off the shore and embarked all our men from the wateringplace each having at least five hundred limes and there being several tubs full on the quarterdeck for every one to squeeze into his water as he should think fit  At break of day on Friday the th  we weighed and sailed out of the bay sending the boats at the same time to the North end of the island to bring off Mr Gore and his hunters At noon we received them and their tents on board with a fine large bull which they had just killed  While we lay at anchor in this place we had many observations for the latitude and longitude from which we drew up the following table  Latitude of the ship as she lay at anchor  °  ′ N  long ° ′ W  Latitude of the wateringplace    N     Longitude of the body of Tinian    W     Longitude of Tinian Road    W     Medium of longitude observed at Tinian         We continued a westerly course inclining somewhat to the North  till the st when Tinian bearing S ° ′ E distant leagues  we saw many birds and the next day saw three resembling gannets of the same kind that we had seen when we were within about thirty leagues of Tinian  On the d we had much thunder lightning and rain  with strong gales and a great sea The ship laboured very much and the rudder being loose again shook the stern as much as ever The next day  we saw several small land birds and the gales continuing we split the gib and maintopmaststaysail the wind increased all the remainder of the day and all night and on Sunday it blew a storm  The foresail and mizensail were torn to pieces and lost and having bent others we wore and stood under a reefed foresail and balanced mizen We had the mortification to find the ship admit more water than usual We got the topgallant masts down upon the deck and took the gibboom in soon after which a sea struck the ship upon the bow and washed away the roundhouses with all the rails of the head and every thing that was upon the forecastle we were however obliged to carry as much sail as the ship would bear being by Lord Anson's account very near the Bashee Islands and by Mr Byron's not more than thirty leagues with a leeshore  The next morning we saw several ducks and shags  some small land birds and a great number of horseflies about the ship but had no ground with fathom The incessant and heavy rain had kept every man on board constantly wet to the skin for more than two days and two nights the weather was still very dark and the sea was continually breaking over the ship  On the th the darkness rain and tempest continuing  a mountainous sea that broke over us staved all the halfports to pieces on the starboardside broke all the iron stanchions on the gunwale washed the boat off the skids and carried many things overboard We had however this day a gleam of sunshine sufficient to determine our latitude  which we found to be ° ′ N and the ship appeared to be fifty minutes North of her reckoning  The weather now became more moderate At noon on the th  we altered our course steering S by W and at half an hour after one we saw the Bashee Islands bearing from S by E to S S E distant about six leagues These islands are all high but the northermost is higher than the rest By an observation made this day we found Grafton Island to lie in the longitude of ° W and in latitude of ° ′ N At midnight the weather being very dark with sudden gusts of wind we missed Edmund Morgan a marine taylor whom we supposed to have fallen overboard having reason to fear that he had drunk more than his allowance  From this time to the d of November  we found the ship every day from ten to fifteen miles North of her reckoning The day before we had seen several gannets but upon sounding many times during the day and the next night we had no ground with fathom This morning at seven o'clock we saw a ledge of breakers bearing S W at the distance of about three miles we hauled off from them and at eleven saw more breakers bearing S W by S distant about five miles At noon we hauled off the east end of them from which we were not distant more than a quarter of a mile  The first shoal lies in latitude ° ′ N longitude from Bashee Islands ° W  The second shoal lies in latitude ° ′ N longitude of the N E end from Bashee Islands ° ′ W  We saw much foul ground to the S and S S E but had no bottom with fathom Before one however we saw shoal water on the larboard bow and standing from it passed  another ledge at two At three we saw a low sandy point  which I called SANDY ISLE  bearing N ½ E distant about two miles At five we saw a small island which I called SMALL KEY  bearing N by E distant about five miles and soon after another larger which I called LONG ISLAND  beyond it At six in the evening the largest island being distant between two and three leagues we brought to and stood off and on from midnight till break of day continually sounding but having no ground  At seven in the morning of Wednesday the th  we saw another island which I called NEW ISLAND  bearing S E by E and a large reef of rocks bearing S ½ W distant six miles At ten we saw breakers from W S W to W by N At noon the North end of the great reef bore S E by E distant two leagues and another reef bore W N W at about the same distance  The latitudes and longitudes of these islands and shoals appear by the following table     Lat N  Long W  Sandy Isle  ° ′  ° ′  Small Key      Long Island      New Island      First Shoal      Second Shoal      Third Shoal      Soon after we saw another reef in latitude ° ′ longitude °  The next day we found the ship  which had for some time been to the northward of her reckoning eight miles to the southward  We continued our course often sounding but finding no bottom On the th  we passed through several ripplings of a current and saw great quantities of driftwood cocoanut leaves things like cones of firs and weed which swam in a stream N E and S W We had now soundings at sixtyfive fathom with brown sand small shells and stones and at noon found the ship again to the northward of her reckoning ten miles and had decreased our soundings to twentyeight fathom with the same ground Our latitude was ° ′ N longitude ° W At two o'clock we saw the island of Condore from the masthead bearing W ½ N At four we had ground with twenty fathom the island bearing from W to N W by W distant about thirteen leagues and having the appearance of high hummocks The latitude of this island is ° ′ N longitude by our reckoning ° ′  We now altered our course and the next morning  I took from the petty officers and seamen all the log and journal books relative to the voyage  On the th  being in latitude ° ′ N longitude ° W we found a current setting four fathom an hour S by W and during our course to the islands Timoun Aros and Pesang which we saw about six in the afternoon of the th  we were every day from ten to twenty miles southward of our reckoning  On the th  at ten in the morning we crossed the line again into South latitude in longitude ° and soon after we saw two islands one bearing S by E distant five leagues the other S by W distant seven leagues  The next morning  the weather became very dark and tempestuous with heavy rain we therefore clewed all up  and lay by till we could see about us The two islands proved to be Pulo Toté and Pulo Weste and having made sail till one o'clock we saw the Seven Islands We continued our course till two the next morning  the weather being very dark with heavy squalls of wind and much lightning and rain While one of these blasts was blowing with all its violence and the darkness was so thick that we could not see from one part of the ship to the other we suddenly discovered by a flash of lightning a large vessel close aboard of us The steersman instantly put the helm alee and the ship answering her rudder we just cleared each other This was the first ship we had seen since we parted with the Swallow and it blew so hard that not being able to understand any thing that was said we could not learn to what nation she belonged  At six the weather having cleared up we saw a sail at anchor in the E S E and at noon we saw land in the W N W which proved to be Pulo Taya Pulo Toté bearing S ° E Pulo Weste S ° E At six in the evening we anchored in fifteen fathom with sandy ground and observed a current running E N E at the rate of five fathom an hour  At six in the morning we weighed and made sail  and soon after saw two vessels ahead but at six in the evening finding that we lost much ground we came again to an anchor in fifteen fathom with a fine sandy bottom  At six o'clock the next morning the current being slack  we hove short on the small bower which soon after parted at a third from the clench We immediately took in the cable and perceived that although we had sounded with great care before we anchored and found the bottom clear it had been cut through by the rocks After some time the current  becoming strong  a fresh gale springing up and the ship being a great way to the leeward I made sail in hopes to get up and recover the anchor but I found at last that it was impossible without anchoring again and being afraid of the consequences of doing that in foul ground I determined to stand on especially as the weather was become squally  We were  however able to make very little way till the next day when about three in the afternoon we saw Monopin Hill bearing S ¾ E and advancing very little saw the coast of Sumatra at half an hour after six the next morning  We continued to suffer great delay by currents and calms but on Monday the th of November  we anchored in Batavia Road  CHAP XII  Transactions at Batavia and an Account of the Passage from thence to the Cape of Good Hope  WE found here fourteen sail of Dutch East India ships  a great number of small vessels and his Majesty's ship the Falmouth lying upon the mud in a rotten condition  I sent an officer on shore to acquaint the Governor of our arrival to obtain his permission to purchase refreshments and to tell him that I would salute him if he would engage to return an equal number of guns The Governor readily agreed and at sunrise on Tuesday the st of December  I saluted him with thirteen guns which he returned with fourteen from the fort Soon after the Purser sent off some fresh beef and plenty of vegetables which I ordered to be served immediately at the same time I called the ship's company together and told them that I would not suffer any liquor to come on board and would severely punish those who should attempt to bring any and I took some pains to reconcile them to this regulation by assuring them that in this country intemperance would inevitably destroy them As a further preservative I suffered not a man to go on shore except those who were upon duty and took care that none even of these straggled into the town  On the d I sent the boatswain and the carpenter  with the carpenter of the Falmouth to look at such of her stores as had been landed at Onrust with orders that if any were  fit for our use they should be bought  At their return they informed me that all the stores they had seen were rotten and unfit for use except one pair of tacks which they brought with them the masts yards and cables were all dropping to pieces and even the iron work was so rusty that it was worth nothing They also went on board the Falmouth to examine her hulk and found her in so shattered a condition that in their opinion she could not be kept together during the next monsoon Many of her ports were washed into one the sternpost was quite decayed and there was no place in her where a man could be sheltered from the weather The few people who belonged to her were in as bad a state as their vessel being quite broken and worn down and expecting to be drowned as soon as the monsoon should set in  Among other necessaries we were in want of an anchor having lost two and of three inch rope for rounding the cables but the officers whom I had sent to procure these articles reported that the price which had been demanded for them was so exorbitant that they had not agreed to give it On Saturday the th  therefore I went on shore myself for the first time and visited the different storehouses and arsenals but found it impossible to make a better bargain than my officers I suspected that the dealers took advantage of our apparent necessity and supposing that we could not sail without what we had offered to purchase determined to extort from us more than four times its value I was however resolved to make any shift rather than submit to what I thought a shameful imposition and therefore told them that I should certainly sail on the next Tuesday that if they would agree to my terms in the mean time I would take the things I had treated for if not that I would sail without them  Soon after I returned on board  I received a petition from the WarrantOfficers of the Falmouth representing that there was nothing for them to look after that the Gunner had been long dead and his stores spoiled particularly the powder which by order of the Dutch had been thrown into the sea that the boatswain by vexation and distress had lost his senses and was then a deplorable object in a Dutch hospital that all his stores had been long spoiled and rotten the roof of the storehouse having fallen in during a wet monsoon and left them exposed many months all endeavours to procure another place to put them in being ineffectual that the carpenter was in a dying condition and the cook a wounded cripple For these reasons they requested that I would take them home or at least dismiss them from their charge It was with the greatest regret and compassion that I told these unhappy people it was not in my power to relieve them and that as they had received charge of stores they must wait orders from home They replied that they had never received a single order from England since they had been left here and earnestly intreated that I would make their distress known that it might be relieved They had they said ten years pay due in the expectation of which they were grown old and which now they would be content to forfeit and go home sweepers rather than continue to suffer the miseries of their present situation which were indeed very great They were not suffered to spend a single night on shore whatever was their condition and when they were sick no one visited them on board they were besides robbed by the Malays and in perpetual dread of being destroyed by them as they had a short time before burnt the Siam prize I assured them that I would do my utmost to procure them relief and they left me with tears in their eyes  As I heard nothing more of the anchor and rope for which I had been in treaty  I made all ready for sea The ship's company had continued healthy and sober and been served with fresh beef every day from the time of our first coming to an anchor in the Road we had also some beef and a live ox to carry out with us We had now only one man upon the sick list except a seaman who had been afflicted with rheumatic pains ever since our leaving the Streight of Magellan and at six o'clock in the morning of Tuesday the th of December  after a stay of just one week we set sail  On the th  at noon we were off a small island called the Cap between the coasts of Sumatra and Java and several of our people fell down with colds and fluxes  The next day a Dutch boat came on board and sold us some turtle which was served to the ship's company At night being at the distance of about two miles from the Java shore we saw an incredible number of lights upon the beach which we supposed were intended to draw the fish near it as we had seen the same appearance at other places  On Monday the th  we anchored off Prince's Island and began to take in wood and water  The next morning the natives came in with turtle poultry and hogdeer which we bought at a reasonable price We continued here fitting the ship for the sea  till the th during which time many of the people began to complain of intermitting disorders something like an ague  At six o'clock the next morning having completed our wood and taken on board seventysix tons of water we made sail  While we lay here one of the seamen fell from the main yard into the barge which lay along side the ship His body was dreadfully bruised and many of his bones were broken it happened also that in his fall he struck two other  men  one of whom was so much hurt that he continued speechless till the th and then died though the other had only one of his toes broken We had now no less than sixteen upon the sick list and by the st of January  the number was increased to forty we had buried three among whom was the QuarterMaster George Lewis who was a diligent sober man and the more useful as he spoke both the Spanish and Portuguese languages The diseases by which we suffered were fluxes and fevers of the putrid kind which are always contagious and for that reason alone would be more fatal on board a ship than any other The Surgeon's mate was very soon laid up and those who were appointed to attend the sick were always taken ill in a day or two after they had been upon that service To remedy this evil as much as it was in my power I made a very large birth for the sick by removing a great number of people from below to the half deck which I hung with painted canvass keeping it constantly clean and directing it to be washed with vinegar and fumigated once or twice a day Our water was well tasted and was kept constantly ventilated a large piece of iron also used for the melting of tar and called a loggerhead was heated red hot and quenched in it before it was given out to be drank The sick had also wine instead of grog and salep or sago every morning for breakfast two days in a week they had mutton broth and had a fowl or two given them on the intermediate days they had besides plenty of rice and sugar and frequently malt meshed so that perhaps people in a sickly ship had never so many refreshments before the Surgeon also was indefatigable yet with all these advantages the sickness on board gained ground In the mean time to aggravate our misfortune the ship made more than three  feet water in a watch  and all her upper works were very open and loose  By the th of January  the sickness began in some degree to abate but more than half the company were so feeble that they could scarcely crawl about On this day being in latitude ° ′ S longitude by account ° ′ W we saw many tropic birds about the ship  On the th  being in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W we saw several albatrosses and caught some bonettas The ship was this day ten miles to the southward of her account  On the th  in latitude ° ′ S longitude by account ° ′ W we met with a violent gale which split the maintopsail and the maintopmaststaysail all to pieces The sea broke over the ship in a dreadful manner the starboard rudderchain was broken and many of the booms were washed overboard During the storm we saw several birds and butterflies and our first attention after it subsided was to dry the bedding of the sick at the same time every one on board who could handle a needle was employed in repairing the sails which were now in a shattered condition  On the th and th  being in latitude ° ′ and becalmed we had several observations by which we determined the longitude of the ship to be ° ′ and it appeared that we were several degrees to the Eastward of our reckoning  At six in the evening of the th of January  we saw land and on the th of February  we anchored in Table Bay at the Cape of Good Hope  Our run from Prince's Island to the Cape was by our reckoning degrees longitude which makes the longitude  of the Cape ° W but the longitude of the Cape being by observation ° ′ it appeared that the ship was three degrees to the Eastward of her reckoning  CHAP XIII  An Account of our Transactions at the Cape of Good Hope and of the Return of the Dolphin to England  AS soon as the ship was at anchor I sent an officer on shore with the usual compliments to the Governor who received him with great civility telling him that we were welcome to all the refreshments and assistance that the Cape afforded and that he would return our salute with the same number of guns  We found riding here a Dutch Commodore with sixteen sail of Dutch East Indiamen a French East India ship and the Admiral Watson Captain Griffin an East India packet boat for Bengal We saluted the Governor with thirteen guns and he returned the same number the Admiral Watson saluted us with eleven guns and we returned nine the French ship afterwards saluted us with nine guns and we returned seven  Having got off some mutton for the ship's company with plenty of greens I sent the Surgeon on shore to hire quarters for the sick but he could procure none for less than two shillings a day and a stipulation to pay more if any of them should take the smallpox which was then in almost every house in proportion to the malignity of the disease  The first expence being great and it appearing upon enquiry that many of our people had never had the smallpox so that the increase was likely to be considerable besides the danger I requested the Governor's permission to erect a tent upon a spacious plain at about two miles distance from the town called Green Point and to send my people on shore thither during the day under the care of an officer to prevent their straggling This permission the Governor immediately granted and gave orders that they should suffer no molestation  In this place therefore I ordered tents to be erected and the Surgeon and his mate with proper officers to attend at the same time strictly charging that no man should be suffered to go into the town and that no liquor should be brought to the tents All the sick except two left the ship early in the morning with their provisions and firing and for those that were reduced to great weakness I ordered the Surgeon to procure such extraordinary provisions as he should think proper particularly milk though it was sold at an excessive price About six in the evening they returned on board and seemed to be greatly refreshed At the same time being extremely ill myself I was obliged to be put on shore and carried about eight miles up the country where I continued all the time the ship lay here and when she was ready to sail returned on board without having received the least benefit  No time however was lost in refitting the vessel the sails were all unbent the yards and topmasts struck the forge was set up the carpenters were employed in caulking the sailmakers in mending the sails the cooper in repairing the casks the people in overhauling the rigging and the boats in filling water  By the th of February  the heavy work being nearly dispatched twenty of the men who had had the smallpox were permitted to go ashore at the town and others who were still liable to the distemper were landed at some distance with orders to go into the country and return in the evening which they punctually obeyed this liberty therefore was continued to them all the while the vessel lay at this port which produced so good an effect that the ship's company except the sick who recovered very fast had a more healthy and vigorous appearance than when they left England We purchased here the necessaries that we endeavoured to procure at Batavia at a reasonable price besides canvas and other stores we also procured fresh water by distillation principally to shew the captains of the Indiamen and their officers that upon an emergency wholesome water might be procured at sea At five o'clock in the morning we put fiftysix gallons of salt water into the still at seven it began to run and in about five hours and a quarter afforded us six and thirty gallons of fresh water at an expence of nine pounds of wood and sixtynine pounds of coals Thirteen gallons and two quarts remained in the still and that which came off had no ill taste nor as we had often experienced any hurtful quality I thought the shewing this experiment of the more consequence as the being able to allow plenty of water not only for drink but for boiling any kind of provision and even for making tea and coffee especially during long voyages and in hot climates conduces greatly to health and is the means of saving many lives I never once put my people to an allowance of water during this whole voyage always using the still when we were reduced to five and forty tons and preserving the rain water with the utmost diligence I did not however allow water to be fetched away at pleasure but the officer of  the watch had orders to give such as brought provisions of any kind water sufficient to dress it and a proper quantity also to such as brought tea and coffee  On the th  the wood and water being nearly completed and the ship almost ready for the sea I ordered every body to go on board and the sick tents to be brought off the people being so well recovered that in the whole ship's company there were but three men unable to do duty and happily since our leaving Batavia we had lost but three The next day  and the day following the carpenters finished caulking all the outworks the forecastle and the maindeck we got all our bread on board from the shore with a considerable quantity of straw and thirtyfour sheep for seastores In the mean time I came on board and having unmoored  lay waiting for a wind till the evening of Thursday the d of March when a breeze springing up we got under sail While we were on shore at Green Point we had an opportunity of making many celestial observations by which we determined Table Bay to lie in latitude ° ′ S longitude from Greenwich ° ′ E The variation of the needle at this place was ° ′ W  On the th  being in latitude ° ′ S longitude by account ° ′ the ship was eight miles to the Northward of her dead reckoning  On the th  having sailed westward degrees from the meridian of London we had lost a day I therefore called the latter part of this day Monday March th  At six o'clock in the evening of Wednesday the th  we saw the Island of Saint Helena at the distance of about fourteen leagues  and at one the next morning brought to At break of day we made sail for the island and at nine anchored in the bay The fort saluted us with thirteen guns  and we returned the same number  We found riding here the Northumberland Indiaman Captain Milford who saluted us with eleven guns and we returned nine We got out all the boats as soon as possible and sent the empty casks to be filled with water at the same time several of the people were employed to gather purslain which grows here in great plenty About two o'clock I went on shore myself and was saluted by the fort with thirteen guns which I returned The Governor and the principal gentlemen of the island did me the honour to meet me at the waterside and having conducted me to the fort told me that it was expected I should make it my home during my stay  By noon the next day our water was completed  and the ship was made ready for sea soon after she was unmoored to take advantage of the first breeze and at five in the afternoon I returned on board Upon my leaving the shore I was saluted with thirteen guns and soon after upon getting under way I was saluted with thirteen more both which I returned the Northumberland Indiaman then saluted me with thirteen guns so did the Osterly which arrived here the evening before I made sail and I returned the compliment with the same number  On the st in the evening  we saw several men of war birds and at midnight heard many birds about the ship  At five o'clock in the morning of the d  we saw the Island of Ascension and at eight discovered a ship to the Eastward who brought to and hoisted a jack at her maintopmasthead upon which we shewed our colours and she then stood in for the land again We ran down close along the northeast side of the island and looked into the bay but seeing no ship there and it blowing a stiff gale I made the best of my way  On Monday the th we crossed the equator  and got again into North latitude  On Wednesday the th of April  we passed a great quantity of gulph weed and on the th  we passed a great deal more On the th  we saw two flocks of birds and observing the water to be discoloured we thought the ground might be reached but upon sounding could find no bottom  At five o'clock in the morning of Sunday the th  we saw the peak of the Island of Pico bearing N N E at the distance of about eighteen leagues We found by observation that Fyal lies in latitude ° ′ N longitude ° ′ W from London  No incident worth recording happened till about noon on the th of May  when being in latitude ° ′ N longitude ° ′ W we saw a ship in chace of a sloop at which she fired several guns We bore away and at three fired a gun at the chace and brought her to the ship to windward being near the chace immediately sent a boat on board her and soon after Captain Hammond of his Majesty's sloop the Savage came on board of me and told me that the vessel he had chaced when he first saw her was in company with an Irish wherry and that as soon as they discovered him to be a man of war they took different ways the wherry hauled the wind and the other vessel bore away That he at first hauled the wind and stood after the wherry but finding that he gained no ground he bore away after the other vessel which probably would also have escaped if I had not stopped her for that he gained very little ground in the chace She appeared to be laden with tea brandy and other goods from Roscoe in France and though she was steering a southwest course pretended to be bound to Bergen in Norway She belonged to Liverpool was called the Jenny and commanded by one Robert Christian Her brandy and tea were in small kegs and bags and all appearances  being strongly against her I detained her in order to be sent to England  At half an hour after five on the th  we saw the Islands of Scilly on the th I landed at Hastings in Sussex  and at four the next morning  the ship anchored safely in the Downs it being just days since her weighing anchor in Plymouth Sound To this narrative I have only to add that the object of the voyage being discovery it was my constant practice during the whole time of my navigating those parts of the sea which are not perfectly known to lie to every night and make sail only in the day that nothing might escape me  A TABLE OF THE LATITUDES and the LONGITUDES West of LONDON with the Variation of the Needle at several Ports and Situations at Sea from Observations made on board his Majesty's Ship the

CHAP I  The Run from Plymouth to Madeira and from thence through the Streight of Magellan  The longitude in this voyage is reckoned from London westward to and eastward afterwards  SOON after I returned from a voyage round the world with the Honourable Commodore Byron  I was appointed to the command of his Majesty's sloop the Swallow by a commission bearing date the st of July the Swallow then lay at Chatham and I was ordered to fit her out with all possible expedition She was an old ship having been in the service thirty years and was in my opinion by no means fit for a long voyage having only a slight thin sheathing upon her bottom which was not even filled with nails to supply the want of a covering that would more effectually keep out the worm I had been given to understand that I was to go out with the Dolphin but the disparity of the two ships and the difference in their equipment made me think that they could not be intended for the same duty the Dolphin which was sheathed with copper being supplied with every thing that was requisite for a long and dangerous navigation and the Swallow having only a scanty supply of common necessaries However I ventured to apply for a forge some iron a small skiff and several other things  which I knew by experience would be of the utmost importance if it was intended that I should make another voyage round the world but I was told that the vessel and her equipment were very fit for the service she was to perform and none of the requisites for which I applied were allowed me I was therefore confirmed in my opinion that if the Dolphin was to go round the world it could never be intended that I should go farther than Falkland's Islands where the Jason a fine frigate which was like the Dolphin sheathed with copper and amply equipped would supply my place I was however deficient in junk an article which is essentially necessary in every voyage and for this I applied when I got to Plymouth but I was told that a quantity sufficient for both the ships had been put on board the Dolphin  On Friday the d of August  the ship's company having the evening before received two months pay I weighed and made sail from Plymouth found in company with the Dolphin under the command of Captain Wallis and the Prince Frederic storeship commanded by Lieutenant James Brine  We proceeded together without any remarkable incident till the th of September when we came to an anchor in Madeira road  While I lay at this place not being yet acquainted with my destination I represented my want of junk and the reply that had been made to my application for a supply by the commissioner at Plymouth in a letter to Captain Wallis who sent me five hundred weight This quantity however was so inadequate to my wants that I was soon afterwards reduced to the disagreeable necessity of cutting off some of my cables to save my rigging  On the th very early in the morning  the Lieutenant acquainted me that in the night nine of my best men had secretly set off from the ship to swim on shore having stripped themselves naked and left all their clothes behind them taking only their money which they had secured in a handkerchief that was tied round their waist that they proceeded together till they came very near the surf which breaks high upon the shore and that one of them being then terrified at the sound had swum back again to the ship and been taken on board but that the rest had ventured through As the loss of these men would have been very severely felt I immediately sat down to write a letter to the Consul entreating his assistance to recover them but before I had finished it he sent me word that all of them having to the great astonishment of the natives been found naked on the beach they had been taken into custody and would be delivered up to my order The boat was dispatched immediately and as soon as I heard they were on board I went upon the deck I was greatly pleased to see a contrition in their countenances which at once secretly determined me not to inflict the punishment by which they seemed most heartily willing to expiate their fault but I asked them what could have induced them to quit the ship and desert the service of their country at the risk of being devoured by sharks or dashed to pieces by the surf against the shore They answered that though they had indeed at such risks ventured to swim on shore they never had any intention of deserting the ship which they were determined to stand by as long as she could swim but that being well assured they were going a long voyage and none being able to tell who might live or who might die they thought it hard not to have an opportunity of spending their own money and therefore determined as they said once more to  get a skinful of liquor  and then swim back to the ship which they hoped to have done before they were missed As I had resolved to remit their punishment I did not too severely scrutinize their apology which the rest of the ship's company who stood round them seemed very much to approve but observing that with a skinful of liquor they would have been in a very unfit condition to swim through the surf to the ship I told them that hoping they would for the future expose their lives only upon more important occasions and that their conduct would thenceforward give me no cause of complaint I would for this time be satisfied with the shame and regret which I perceived they suffered from a sense of their misbehaviour I then admonished them to put on their clothes and lie down as I was confident they wanted rest and added that as I might possibly during the course of the voyage have occasion for good swimmers I was very glad that I knew to whom I might apply Having thus dismissed these honest fellows from their fears I was infinitely gratified by the murmur of satisfaction which instantly ran through the ship's company and was afterwards amply rewarded for my lenity there being no service during all the toils and dangers of the voyage which they did not perform with a zeal and alacrity that were much to their honour and my advantage as an example to the rest  We sailed again on the th  and I was then first acquainted with the particulars of our voyage by Captain Wallis who gave me a copy of his instructions and appointed Port Famine in the Streight of Magellan to be the place of rendezvous if we should happen to be separated  I was now convinced that I had been sent upon a service to which my vessel and her equipment were by no means  equal  but I determined at all events to perform it in the best manner I was able  We proceeded on our voyage without any remarkable event till we anchored off Cape Virgin Mary where we saw the Patagonians of which I have given some account in a letter to Dr Matty which was published in the sixtieth volume of the Transactions of the Royal Society and which it is not necessary here to repeat as it is in general the same as those which have been given by Commodore Byron and Captain Wallis  When we entered the Streight I was ordered to keep ahead of the Dolphin and the storeship to pilot them through the shoals but my ship worked so ill that we could but very seldom make her tack without the help of a boat to tow her round however with much labour and at no inconsiderable risk we anchored in Port Famine on Friday the th of December  At this place we unhung our rudder and added a piece of wood to it in hopes that by making it broader we should obtain some advantage in working the ship in which however we were altogether disappointed  After many difficulties and dangers  we got into Island Bay on the th of February and before we made sail again I represented the condition of my ship by letter to Captain Wallis and requested him to consider what was best for his Majesty's service whether she should be dismissed or continue the voyage Captain Wallis replied that as the Lords of the Admiralty had ordered the Swallow on this service with the nature of which I was well acquainted he did not think himself at liberty to alter her destination  We continued therefore for some time to navigate the Streight together and as I had passed it before I was ordered to keep ahead and lead the way with liberty to anchor and weigh when I thought proper but perceiving that the bad sailing of the Swallow would so much retard the Dolphin as probably to make her lose the season for getting into high southern latitudes and defeat the intention of the voyage I proposed to Captain Wallis that he should lay the Swallow up in some cove or bay and that I should attend and assist him with her boats till the Streight should be passed which would probably be in much less time than if he continued to be retarded by my ship and I urged as an additional advantage that he might complete not only his stock of provisions and stores but his company out of her and then send her back to England with such of his crew as sickness had rendered unfit for the voyage proposing also that in my way home I would examine the eastern cost of Patagonia or attempt such other discoveries as he should think proper If this was not approved and my knowlege of the South Seas was thought necessary to the success of the voyage I offered to go with him on board the Dolphin and give up the Swallow to be commanded by his First Lieutenant whose duty I would perform during the rest of the voyage or to make the voyage myself with only the Dolphin if he would take the Swallow back to Europe but Captain Wallis was still of opinion that the voyage should be prosecuted by the two ships jointly pursuant to the orders that had been given  The Swallow was now become so foul that with all the sails she could set she could not make so much way as the Dolphin  with only her topsails and a reef in them we continued in company however till Friday the th of  April when the western entrance of the Streight was open  and the great South Sea in sight Hitherto I had pursuant to my directions kept ahead but now the Dolphin being nearly abreast of us set her foresail which soon carried her ahead of us and before nine o'clock in the evening as she shewed no lights we lost sight of her We had a fine eastern breeze of which we made the best use we could during the night carrying all our small sails even to the topgallant studding sails notwithstanding the danger to which it exposed us but at daybreak the next morning  we could but just see the Dolphin's topsails above the horizon we could perceive however that she had studding sails set and at nine o'clock we had entirely lost sight of her we judged that she was then clear of the Streight's mouth but we who were still under the land had but light and variable airs From this time I gave up all hope of seeing the Dolphin again till we should arrive in England no plan of operation having been settled nor any place of rendezvous appointed as had been done from England to the Streight I thought myself the more unfortunate in this separation as no part of the woollen cloth linen beads scissars knives and other cutleryware and toys which were intended for the use of both ships and were so necessary to obtain refreshments from Indians had during the nine months we had sailed together been put on board the Swallow and as we were not provided either with a forge or iron which many circumstances might render absolutely necessary to the preservation of the ship I had the satisfaction however to see no marks of despondency among my people whom I encouraged by telling them that although the Dolphin was the best ship I did not doubt but that I should find more than equivalent advantages in their courage ability and good conduct  At noon  this day we were abreast of Cape Pillar when a gale springing up at S W we were obliged to take down our small sails reef our topsails and haul close to the wind soon after it freshened to the W S W blowing right in from the sea and after making two boards we had the mortification to find that we could not weather the land on either tack It was now almost dark the gale increased driving before it a hollow swell and a fog came on with violent rain we therefore got close under the south shore and sent our boat ahead to find out Tuesday's Bay which is said by Sir John Narborough to lie about four leagues within the Streight or to find out any other place in which we might come to an anchor At five o'clock we could not see the land notwithstanding its extream height though we were within less than half a mile of it and at six the thickness of the weather having rendered the night so dark that we could not see half the ship's length I brought to for the boat and was indeed with good reason under great concern for her safety we hoisted lights and every now and then made a false fire but still doubting whether they could be seen through the fog and rain I fired a gun every half hour and at last had the satisfaction to take her on board though she had made no discovery either of Tuesday's Bay or any other anchoringplace We made sail the rest of the night endeavouring to keep near the south shore and our ground to the westward as much as possible and as soon as it was light the next morning  I sent the Master again out in the cutter in search of anchorage on the south shore I waited in a state of the most painful suspense for her return till five o'clock in the afternoon fearing that we should be obliged to keep out in this dangerous pass another night but I then saw her sounding a bay and immediately stood in after her in a short time the Master came on board and  to our unspeakable comfort  reported that we might here come safely to an anchor this with the help of our boat was effected about six o'clock and I went down into my cabbin to take some rest I had however scarcely lain down before I was alarmed with a universal shout and tumult among the people all that were below running hastily upon the deck and joining the clamour of those above I instantly started up imagining that a gust had forced the ship from her anchor and that she was driving out of the bay but when I came upon the deck I heard the people cry out the Dolphin the Dolphin in a transport of surprize and joy which appeared to be little short of distraction a few minutes however convinced us that what had been taken for a sail was nothing more than the water which had been forced up and whirled about in the air by one of the violent gusts that were continually coming off the high land and which through the haze had a most deceitful appearance The people were for a few minutes somewhat dejected by their disappointment but before I went down I had the pleasure to see their usual fortitude and cheerfulness return  The little bay where we were now at anchor lies about three leagues E by S from Cape Pillar it is the first place which has any appearance of a bay within that Cape and bears S by E about four leagues from the island which Sir John Narborough called Westminster Hall from its resemblance to that building in a distant view The western point of this bay makes a very remarkable appearance being a perpendicular plane like the wall of a house There are three islands about two cables' length within its entrance and within those islands a very good harbour with anchorage in between twentyfive and thirty fathom with a bottom of soft mud We anchored without the islands the passage  on each side of them being not more than onefourth of a cable's length wide Our little bay is about two cables' length broad the points bearing east and west of each other in the inner part there is from sixteen to eighteen fathom but where we lay it is deeper we had one anchor in seventeen fathom and the other in fortyfive with great overfalls between them and rocks in several places Here we rode out a very hard gale and the ground being extremely uneven we expected our cables to be cut in two every minute yet when we weighed to our great surprize they did not appear to have been rubbed in any part though we found it very difficult to heave them clear of the rocks The land round this bay and harbour is all high and as the current sets continually into it I doubt not but it has another communication with the sea to the south of Cape Deseada The Master said he went up it four miles in a boat and could not then be above four miles from the Western Ocean yet I still saw a wide entrance to the S W The landing is every where good there is plenty of wood and water and muscles and wild geese in abundance  From the north shore of the western end of the Streight of Magellan which lies in about latitude ° ½ S to latitude ° the land which is the western coast of Patagonia runs nearly north and south and consists wholly of broken islands among which are those that Sharp has laid down by the name of the Duke of York's Islands he has indeed placed them at a considerable distance from the coast but if there had been many islands in that situation it is impossible but that the Dolphin the Tamar or the Swallow must have seen them as we ran near their supposed meridian and so did the Dolphin and the Tamar the last voyage Till we came into this latitude we had tolerable weather and little  or no current in any direction but when we came to the northward of ° we found a current setting strongly to the north so that probably we then opened the great bay which is said to be ninety leagues deep We found here a vast swell from the N W and the winds generally blew from the same quarter yet we were set every day twelve or fifteen miles to the northward of our account  On Wednesday the th  at about four o'clock in the morning after surmounting many dangers and difficulties we once more got abreast of Cape Pillar with a light breeze at S E and a great swell Between five and six o'clock just as we opened Cape Deseada the wind suddenly shifted to S and S by W and blew so hard that it was with great difficulty we could carry the reefed topsails the sudden changing of the wind and its excessive violence produced a sea so dreadfully hollow that great quantities of water were thrown in upon our deck so that we were in the utmost danger of foundering yet we did not dare to shorten sail it being necessary to carry all we could spread in order to weather the rocky islands which Sir John Narborough has called the Islands of Direction for we could not now run back again into the Streight without falling down among the broken land and incurring the dangers of the northern shore which was to leeward towards this broken land however and lee shore the ship settled very fast notwithstanding our utmost efforts in this pressing emergency we were obliged to stave all the watercasks upon the deck and between decks to clear the vessel and to make her carry better sail and at length happily escaped the danger which threatened us After we got clear of these islands and drew off from the Streight's mouth and the land we found  the sea run more regularly from the S W and the wind soon after coming from S S W to S S E we had by noon got a pretty good offing  about nine leagues from Cape Victory which is on the north shore Thus we cleared the western entrance of this Streight which in my opinion is too dangerous for navigation a deliverance which happened in the very crisis of our fate for almost immediately afterwards the wind came again to the S W and if it had continued in that quarter our destruction would have been inevitable  CHAP II  The Passage from Cape Pillar at the Western Entrance of the Streight of Magellan to Masafuero with some Account of that Island  I TOOK my departure from Cape Pillar  which I make to lie in the latitude of ° ′ S and in the longitude ° ′ W of the meridian of London and as soon as I got clear of the Streight steered to the northward along the coast of Chili Upon examining what quantity of fresh water we had now on board I found that it amounted only to between four and five and twenty tons which I thought not sufficient for so long a voyage as was probably before us I therefore hauled to the northward intending to make the island of Juan Fernandes or Masafuero that we might increase our stock before we sailed to the westward  In the middle of the night of the th  we had the wind first to the S S E and then to the S E with which we kept away N W and N N W in high spirits hoping that in a short time we should be in a more temperate climate we had the misfortune however very soon to find ourselves disappointed for on the th  the wind came to the N N W and blew directly from the point upon which we were steering We had now got about a hundred leagues from the Streight's mouth our latitude was ° ′ S and we were by account ° ′ W of Cape Pillar but from this time till the th of May the wind continued unfavourable and blew a continued storm with sudden gusts still more  violent  and much rain and hail or rather fragments of half melted ice at intervals also we had thunder and lightning more dreadful than all the past and a sea which frequently laid the whole vessel under water  From the time of our clearing the Streight and during our passage along this coast we saw a great number of sea birds particularly albatrosses gannets sheerwaters and a thick lumpish bird about as big as a large pigeon which the sailors call a Cape of Good Hope hen they are of a dark brown or blackish colour and are therefore sometimes called the black gull we saw also a great many pintado birds of nearly the same size which are prettily spotted with black and white and constantly on the wing though they frequently appear as if they were walking upon the water like the peterels to which sailors have given the name of Mother Carey's chickens and we saw also many of these  In the evening of Monday the th  which was very dark as we were standing to the westward under our courses and a close reefed topsail the wind in a hard squall suddenly shifted and took the vessel right ahead the violent jerk with which the sails were instantly thrown aback was very near carrying the masts away by the board and oversetting the ship the sails being at this time extremely wet and the gale in the highest degree violent they clung so fast to the masts and rigging that it was scarcely possible to get them either up or down yet by the dexterous activity of our people we got the mainsail up clewed up the main topsail and got the ship's head round without receiving much damage The violence of the wind continued several hours but before morning it veered again to the N W and continued in that quarter till the afternoon of the th  when  it died away and we had a dead calm for six hours  During this time we had a high sea which ran in great confusion from all quarters and broke against the ship in a strange manner making her roll with so violent and sudden a motion that I expected every moment to lose our masts The wind afterwards sprung up at W S W which was fair and we carried all the sail we could set to make the most of it It blew very hard in this direction with heavy rain for a few hours but by noon on the th  it returned to its usual quarter the N W and was so violent as to bring us again under our courses there being at the same time a prodigious swell which frequently broke over us  At five o'clock the next morning as we were lying to under the reefed mainsail and balanced mizen a vast sea broke over the quarter where the ship's oars were lashed and carried away six of them with the weathercloth it also broke the mizen gaff close where the sail was reefed and the iron strap of one of the main dead eyes laying the whole vessel for some time under water we were however fortunate enough to haul up the main sail without splitting though it blew a hurricane and a deluge of rain or rather of half melted ice at the same time poured down upon us The wind soon after shifted again from N W to S W and for about an hour blew if possible stronger than ever This wind made the ship come up with her head right against the vast sea which the north west wind had raised and at every pitch which she made against it the end of the bowsprit was under water and the surge broke over the forecastle as far aft as the mainmast in the same manner as it would have broke over a rock so that there was the greatest reason to apprehend she would founder With all her defects she was indeed a good sea boat and if she had not it would have been impossible for her to have outlived this storm in which  as well as on several other occasions  we experienced the benefit of the bulkheads which we had fixed on the forepart of the half deck and to the afterpart of the forecastle  Notwithstanding this wind was fair we durst not venture to put the ship before it for if in wearing any of these enormous seas had broken on her side it would inevitably have carried away all before it After some time however it became more moderate and we then got up our yards and made sail steering N by W and now the men having been up all night and being wet to the skin I ordered every one of them a dram  By the next morning the d of May  the wind came again to the N W and N N W but by this time we had got down the broken mizen gaff repaired it as well as we could got it up again in its place and bent the sail to it but we now most sensibly felt the want of a forge and iron  On the d  at daybreak we found the rudderchain broken and upon this occasion we again most feelingly regretted the want of a forge we made however the best shift we could  and the next day the weather being more moderate though the wind was still contrary we repaired our rigging and the carpenters fixed a new dead eye where the old one had been broken the sailmaker also was busy in mending the sails that had been split  On the th  we were again brought under our courses by a hurricane from the N by W and N N W and the ship was tossed about with such violence that we had no command of her During this storm two of our chainplates were broken and we continued toiling in a confused hollow sea till midnight when a light gale sprung up at N W which soon blew very hard  but at two in the morning we were again taken right ahead by a sudden and violent squall at  west which at once threw all our sails aback  and before we could get the ship round was very near carrying all by the board With this gale we stood north and in the forenoon the carpenters fixed new chainplates to the main shrouds and one to the fore shrouds in the place of those which had been broken in the squall during the night This was another occasion on which it was impossible not to regret the want of a forge and iron  The gale continued in this direction till eight in the morning of the th  when it returned to the N W with unsettled weather On the th it came to south  and this was a fine day the first we had seen after our leaving the Streight of Magellan Our latitude at noon was ° ′ S and we were about five degrees to the westward of Cape Pillar  The next day we made the island of Masafuero and on the th the island of Juan Fernandes in the afternoon we got close to the eastermost part of it and soon after hauled round the north end and opened Cumberland Bay As I did not know that the Spaniards had fortified this island I was greatly surprized to see a considerable number of men about the beach with a house and four pieces of cannon near the waterside and a fort about three hundred yards farther from the sea just upon the rising of the hill with Spanish colours flying on the top of it This fort which is faced with stone has eighteen or twenty embrasures and within it a long house which I supposed to be barracks for the garrison five and twenty or thirty houses of different kinds are scattered round it and we saw much cattle feeding on the brow of the hills which seemed to be cultivated as many spots were divided by enclosures from each other we saw also two large boats lying on the beach The gusts of wind which came right out of this bay prevented my going so near as I intended for they were so violent as to oblige us  many times to let fly our topsail sheets  though the sails were close reefed and I think it is impossible to work a ship into this bay when the wind blows hard from the southward As we stood cross the bay to the westward one of the boats put off from the shore and rowed towards us but perceiving that the gusts or flaws made us lie at a considerable distance from the land she went in again We then opened West Bay on the east part of which close to the sea side is a small house which I took for a guardhouse and two pieces of cannon mounted upon their carriages without any works about them We now wore and stood again for Cumberland Bay but as soon as we opened it the boat again put off and made towards us as the hard gusts would not permit us to come any nearer to the land than before we stood along it to the eastward the boat still making after us till she was very far out of the bay at length it grew dark and we lost sight of her upon which we made all the sail we could to the eastward  During all this time I hoisted no colours having none but English on board which at this time I did not think it proper to shew  As I was disappointed of wood and water at this place and of the refreshments of which after the dangers and fatigue of our voyage through the Streight and our passage from it  we stood in the most pressing need I made all the sail I could for the island of Masafuero On the th of May we arrived off the south eastermost part of it but it blowing hard with a great sea we did not dare to come near it on this side and therefore went round to the west side where in the evening we cast anchor upon an excellent bank sit to receive a fleet of ships which in the summer might ride here with great advantage I sent out both the boats to endeavour  to get some water  but they found it impossible to land for the beach is rocky and the surf at this time was so great that the swimmers could not get through the breakers this was the more mortifying as we saw a fine run of fresh water from the ship with plenty of trees sit for firewood and a great number of goats upon the hills  The next morning as soon as it was light  I sent the boats out again to examine any place where they could get on shore They returned with a few casks of water which they had filled at a small rill and reported that the wind being at S E blew so strong on the east side of the island and raised so great a sea that they could not come near the shore  We continued here till the th at daybreak and then  the weather becoming more moderate we weighed and in the evening just at sunset we anchored on the east side of the island in the same place where Commodore Byron had anchored about two years before We lost no time but immediately got off fifteen casks of water and sent a number of men on shore with others that were empty to be filled against the next morning and a strong party to cut wood  but it happened that about two o'clock in the morning a hard gale of wind came on from the N W with violent gusts from the shore which drove us off the bank though we had two anchors ahead which were in the utmost danger of being lost we got them up however with great difficulty and immediately set the sails and worked under the lee of the island keeping as near the shore as we could the weather soon afterwards became more moderate so that we could carry double reefed topsails we had also very smooth water yet we could not make the ship tack and were forced to wear her every time we wanted to go about  At daybreak  though we were at a good distance from the shore I sent the cutter to get off a load of water before the surf should be so great upon the beach as to prevent her landing About ten o'clock the wind came to the N N E which enabled us to get within a little distance of the wateringplace and we might have recovered our anchoring ground upon the bank from which we had been driven but the weather had so bad an appearance and the gale freshened so fast that we did not think it prudent to venture we brought to however as near the shore as possible for the advantage of smooth water to unload the cutter which soon after came alongside with twelve casks of water As soon as we had taken these on board I sent the cutter again for another freight and as we were at a very little distance from land I ventured to send our longboat a clumsey heavy fouroared vessel with provisions for the people on shore and orders to bring back a load of water if she could get it as soon as these boats were dispatched we made a tack off to keep our ground At noon it blew hard with heavy rain and thick weather and at one as we were standing in again we saw the boats running along the shore for the lee part of the island this side being open to the wind we therefore followed them and brought to as near the shore as possible to favour their coming on board they presently made toward us and we hoisted them in but the sea was now risen so high that in going it they received considerable damage and we soon learnt that they found the surf so great as not to be able even to land their empty water casks We continued to lie to under a balanced mizen off the lee part or the island all the afternoon and although all hands had been constantly employed ever since the ship had been driven off her anchoring ground the carpenters worked all night in repairing the boats  At four o'clock in the morning the island bore west of us  being four leagues distant and right to windward we had now a fine gale and smooth water and about ten o'clock we fetched very near to the south part of it and with the help of the boat made the ship tack As it was not probable that with such a vessel we could regain the anchoringground I took advantage of our being so near the shore though at a good distance from the wateringplace to send the cutter for another load In the mean time I stood on and off with the ship and about four o'clock in the afternoon the cutter brought her freight of water on board I enquired of the Lieutenant after the people on shore and he told me that the violent rain which had fallen in the night had suddenly brought down such torrents of water through the hollow or gully where they had taken up their station that they were in the utmost danger of being swept away before it and though with great difficulty they saved themselves several of the casks were intirely lost It was now too late for the boat to make another turn to the place where we had hitherto got our water but Mr Erasmus Gower the Lieutenant whose diligence and ability in all our dangers and distress I cannot sufficiently commend having as he returned with the cutter observed that many runs of water had been made by the night's rain on that part of the island which was nearest to us and knowing how impatient I was of delay offered to go thither with the boat and fill as many casks as she could bring back I gladly accepted this offer Mr Gower went away in the boat and in the mean time I made a tack off with the ship but before they had been gone an hour the weather began to grow gloomy and the wind to freshen a heavy black cloud at the same time settled over the island so as to hide the tops of the hills and soon after it began to thunder and lighten at a dreadful  rate  as these appearances were very threatening I stood in again towards the island in hopes of meeting with the boat but though we ran in as close as we durst we saw nothing of her In the mean time night came on which the thickness of the weather rendered extremely dark the gale increased and it began to rain with great violence in this situation I lay to under a balanced mizen firing guns and burning false fires as a guide to the boat and not being able to account for her delay I suffered the most distressful anxiety and had indeed but too much reason to fear that she was lost About seven o'clock however to my unspeakable satisfaction she came safe alongside and as I had long seen a storm gathering which I expected every moment to burst upon us we got her in with all possible expedition It was indeed happy for us all that no time was lost for before she could be got into her place the squall came on which in a moment laid the ship down in a surprising manner and broke the mizen gaff just where the sail was reefed so that if another minute had passed before the boat had been got in we must inevitably have lost her and every soul on board would have perished This wind and weather continued till midnight when it became somewhat more moderate so that we were able to set our courses and topsails In the mean time I had enquired of Mr Gower how it came to be so long before he returned to the ship and he told me that after he had got to the place where he intended to fill the casks three of the boat's crew had swum ashore with them for that purpose but that within a few minutes the surf had risen so high and broke with such fury on the shore that it was impossible for them to get back to the boat that being unwilling to leave them behind especially as they were stark naked he had waited in hopes that an opportunity might be found for their coming on  board  but that being intimidated by the appearance of the weather and the uncommon darkness of the night he had at last with whatever reluctance been obliged to come on board without them The situation of these poor fellows now furnished another subject of solicitude and anxiety they were naked upon a desolate island at a great distance from the wateringplace where their shipmates had a tent without food and without shelter in a night of violent and incessant rain with such thunder and lightning as in Europe is altogether unknown In the evening of the th however I had the satisfaction to receive them on board and to hear an account of their adventures from their own lips As long as it was light they flattered themselves like their friends in the boat that they should find an opportunity to return on board her but afterwards when the darkness of the night was broken only by the flashes of lightning and the tempest became every moment more violent they knew that to reach the boat was impossible if it still remained in its station and that most probably the people on board had provided for their own safety by returning on board the ship to reach the tent of their shipmates during the darkness and tempest was equally beyond their power and they were reduced to the necessity of passing such a night in such a place without the least defence against either the rain or the cold which now began to be severely felt Necessity is said to be ingenious and they contrived to procure a temporary succedaneum both for apparel and a shed by lying one upon another each man alternately placing himself between the other two in this situation it may easily be believed that they longed most ardently for the dawn and as soon as it appeared they set out for the tent they were obliged however to make their way along the sea shore for the inland country was impassable nor was this the worst  for they were frequently stopped by high steep bluff points  which they were obliged to swim round at a considerable distance for if they had not taken a compass they would have been dashed to pieces against the rocks by the surf and as it was they were every moment in danger of being devoured by a shark About ten o'clock in the morning however they reached the tents almost perished with hunger and cold and were received with equal surprise and joy by their shipmates who immediately shared with them such provisions and clothes as they had When they came on board I gave orders that they should have such refreshments as were proper and remain in their hammocks the whole night The next day they were as hearty as if nothing had happened nor did they suffer any farther inconvenience from the accident These were three of the honest fellows who had swum naked from the ship at the island of Madeira to get a skinful of liquor I now return to my narrative in the order of time  On the th  the weather was moderate and in the evening we were within half a mile of the anchoringground from which we had been driven but the wind suddenly failing and a current making against us we could not reach it we took advantage however of being so near the waterer's tent to send a boat on shore to enquire after the three men whose adventure has been just related and soon after she brought them on board The carpenters were all this time employed in making a new mizengaff out of a gibboom and in the mean while we were obliged to make shift with the old one keeping the sail balanced It continued a stark calm all the night  so that in the morning we found the current and the swell had driven us no less than nine miles from the land the weather however being good  I sent the cutter for a load of water  which she brought on board about one o'clock Soon after a breeze sprung up at N N W and as we now approached the land very fast I sent the boat on shore again for water it happened however that before we could reach our anchoringground it again fell calm and we were again kept off by the current the boat in the mean time as she rowed along the shore caught as much fish with hook and line as served all the ship's company which was some alleviation of our disappointment At eight o'clock in the evening it began again to blow hard with sudden squalls so that we passed another toilsome and dangerous night In the morning  having a stiff gale at N W we made towards our anchoringground with all the sail we could spread and happily regained it about four o'clock in the afternoon when we anchored at two cables' length from the beach in eighteen fathom with a bottom of fine sand and moored with a small anchor in shore By the time the ship was properly secured it was too late to proceed with our watering the longboat however was sent along the shore to fish and though before seven o'clock it blew so hard that she was obliged to return she brought fish enough on board to serve all the people In the night we had foul weather with hard squalls and much rain and in the morning  the wind blowing with great violence along the shore we frequently drove though we had not less than two hundred fathom of cable out for the bank is a loose fine sand that easily gives way We rode out the storm however without damage but the rain was so violent and the sea ran so high that nothing could be done with the boats which was the more mortifying as it was for the sake of completing our watering that we had endured almost incessant labour far five days and nights to regain the situation in which we now lay About eight in the  evening  the wind became more moderate and though it was then too late to fetch off any water we got out one of the boats and sent three men on shore right abreast of the ship to kill seals and make oil of their fat for burning in lamps and other uses on board the ship  The wind blew very hard the next morning  as it had done all night but being at W N W which was off the land we sent the boats away soon after it was light and about ten they returned with each of them a load of water and a great number of pintado birds these birds they got from the people on shore who told them that when a gale of wind happened in the night they flew faster into their fire than they could well take them out so that during the gale of the last night they got no less than seven hundred of them The boats were employed in getting water on board all this day although the surf was so great that several of the casks were staved and lost they were sent out again a little before it was light the next day  and by seven o'clock a few casks only were wanting to complete our stock The threatening appearances of the weather made me now very impatient to get the people on board with the casks that were still at the wateringplace as soon therefore as the boats were cleared of their loading I dispatched them again with orders to bring off all the hands with the tent and every thing else that was on shore with all possible expedition From this time the wind increased very fast and by eleven o'clock it blew so hard with violent gusts from the land that the ship began to drive off the bank we heaved the small anchor up and got it in out of the way of the other the gale still increased but as it was right off the land I was in no pain about the ship which continued to drive still dragging the anchor through the sand with two hundred fathom of cable  out  for being very solicitous to give the boats time to bring all on board before we were quite off the bank I would not weigh At two o'clock however the anchor was quite off the ground and the ship was in deep water we were now therefore obliged to bring the cable to the capstern and with great difficulty we got the anchor up The gusts off the land were so violent that not daring to show any canvas we lay to under our bare poles and the water was frequently torn up and whirled round in the air much higher than our masts heads As the ship now drove from the island at a great rate and night was coming on I began to be in great pain for the boats in which besides my Lieutenant there were eight and twenty of my best men but just in the dusk of the evening I perceived one of them scudding before the seas and making towards the ship this proved to be the longboat which in spight of all the efforts of those on board had been forced from her grappling and driven off the land We took the best opportunity that offered to get her on board but notwithstanding all our care she received considerable damage as we were hoisting her in She had on board ten of my people who informed me that when they were first driven from the shore they had some fire wood on board but that they were obliged to throw that and every thing else into the sea to lighten the boat As we had yet seen nothing of the cutter and had reason to fear that she also with the tents and the other eighteen people besides the Lieutenant had been driven off the island I gave her up for lost knowing that if the night which was now at hand should overtake her in such a storm she must inevitably perish It was however possible that the people might be ashore and therefore that if the boat should be lost they might still be preserved for this reason I determined to regain the land as soon as possible At midnight  the weather became more moderate  so that we could carry our courses and topsails and at four o'clock in the morning we crowded all the sail we could make At ten o'clock we were very near the shore to our great concern we saw nothing of the cutter yet we continued to stand on till about noon when we happily discovered her at a grappling close under the land we immediately ran to our glasses by the help of which we saw the people getting into her and about three o'clock to our mutual and inexpressible joy she came safe on board with all her people they were however so exhausted with fatigue that they could scarcely get up the ship's side The Lieutenant told me that the night before he had attempted to come off but that as soon as he had left the shore a sudden squall so nearly filled the boat with water that she was very near going to the bottom but that all hands bailing with the utmost diligence and activity they happily cleared her that he then made for the land again which with the utmost difficulty he regained and having left a sufficient number on board the boat to watch her and keep her free from water he with the rest of the people went on shore That having passed the night in a state of inexpressible anxiety and distress they looked out for the ship with the first dawn of the morning and seeing nothing of her concluded that she had perished in the storm which they had never seen exceeded They did not however sit down torpid in despair but began immediately to clear the ground near the beach of brushes and weeds and cut down several trees of which they made rollers to assist them in hauling up the boat in order to secure her intending as they had no hope of the ship's return to wait till the summer season and then attempt to make the island of Juan Fernandes They had now better hopes and all sense of the dangers that were before us  A View of the N W side of MASAFUERA  view  Masafuera bearing NW distant about Leagues  view  was for a while obliterated by the joy of our escape from those that were past  From the th when we were first driven from our anchoring ground to this time we suffered an uninterrupted series of danger fatigue and misfortunes The ship worked and sailed very ill the weather was dark and tempestuous with thunder lightning and rain and the boats which I was obliged to keep always employed even when we were under sail to procure us water were in continual danger of being lost as well by the hard gales which constantly blew as by the sudden gusts which frequently rushed upon us with a violence that is scarcely to be conceived This distress was the more severe as it was unexpected for I had experienced very different weather in these parts about two years before with Commodore Byron It has generally been thought that upon this coast the winds are constantly from the S to the S W though Frazier mentions his having had strong gales and high seas from the N N W and N W quarter which was unhappily my case  Having once more got my people and boats safe on board I made sail from this turbulent climate and thought myself fortunate not to have left any thing behind me except the wood which our people had cut for firing  The island of Masafuero lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W of London Its situation is west of Juan Fernandes both being nearly in the same latitude and by the globe it is distant about thirtyone leagues It is very high and mountainous and at a distance appears like one hill or rock it is of a triangular form and about seven or eight leagues in circumference The south part which we saw when we first made the island at the distance of three and twenty leagues  is much the highest on the north end there are several spots of clear ground which perhaps might admit of cultivation  The author of the account of Lord Anson's voyage mentions only one part of this island as affording anchorage which is on the north side and in deep water but we saw no part where there was not anchorage on the west side in particular there is anchorage at about a mile from the shore in twenty fathom and at about two miles and a half in forty and fortyfive fathom with a fine black sand at the bottom This author also says that "there is a reef of rocks running off the eastern point of the island about two miles in length which may be seen by the sea's breaking over them" but in this he is mistaken there is no reef of rocks or shoal running off the eastern point but there is a reef of rocks and sand running off the western side near the south end of it He is also mistaken as to the distance of this island from Juan Fernandes and its direction for he says the distance is twentytwo leagues and the direction W by S but we found the distance nearly onethird more and the direction is due west for as I have before observed the latitude of both islands is nearly the same The goats that he mentions we found upon it in the same abundance and equally easy to be caught  On the south west point of the island there is a remarkable rock with a hole in it which is a good mark to come to an anchor on the western side where there is the best bank of any about the place About a mile and a half to the northward of this hole there is a low point of land and from this point runs the reef that has been just mentioned in the direction of W by S to the distance of about three quarters of a mile where the sea continually breaks upon it To anchor  run in till the hole in the rock is shut in about a cable's length upon this low point of land then bearing S by E ½ E and anchor in twenty and twentytwo fathom fine black sand and shells there is anchorage also at several places on the other sides of the island particularly off the north point in fourteen and fifteen fathom with fine sand  There is plenty of wood and water all round the island but they are not to be procured without much difficulty a great quantity of stones and large fragments of the rock have fallen from the high land all round the island and upon these there breaks such a surf that a boat cannot safely come within a cable's length of the shore there is therefore no landing here but by swimming from the boat and then mooring her without the rocks nor is there any method of getting off the wood and water but by hauling them to the boat with ropes there are however many places where it would be very easy to make a commodious landing by building a wharf which it would be worth while even for a single ship to do if she was to continue any time at the island  This part of Masafuero is a very good place for refreshment especially in the summer season the goats have been mentioned already and there is all round the island such plenty of fish that a boat may with three hooks and lines catch as much as will serve an hundred people among others we caught excellent coal fish cavallies cod hallibut and crayfish We took a kingfisher that weighed eightyseven pounds and was five feet and an half long and the sharks were so ravenous that when we were sounding one of them swallowed the lead by which we hauled him above water but as he then disgorged it we lost him The seals were so numerous that I verily think if many thousands of  them were killed in a night they would not be missed in the morning we were obliged to kill great numbers of them as when we walked the shore they were continually running against us making at the same time a most horrible noise These animals yield excellent train oil and their hearts and plucks are very good eating being in taste something like those of a hog and their skins are covered with the finest fur I ever saw of the kind There are many birds here and among others some very large hawks Of the pintado birds our people as I have before observed caught no less than seven hundred in one night We had not much opportunity to examine the place for vegetable productions but we saw several leaves of the mountain cabbage which is a proof that the tree grows here  CHAP III  The Passage from Masafuero to Queen Charlotte's IsIands several Mistakes corrected concerning Davis's Land and an Account of some small Islands supposed to be the same that were seen by Quiros  WHEN we took our departure from Masafuero we had a great sea from the N W with a swell of long billows from the southward and the wind which was from the S W to the W N W obliged me to stand to the northward in hope of getting the south east tradewind for the ship was so dull a sailer that there was no making her go without a strong wind in her favour Having thus run farther to the northward than at first I intended and finding myself not far from the parallel of latitude which has been assigned to two islands called Saint Ambrose and Saint Felix or Saint Paul I thought I should perform an acceptable service by examining if they were fit for shipping to refresh at especially as the Spaniards having fortified Juan Fernandes they might be found convenient for Great Britain if she should hereafter be engaged in a Spanish war These islands are laid down in Green's charts which were published in the year from latitude ° ′ to ° S and from ° ¼ to ° ½ W of Masafuero I therefore hauled up with a design to keep in that latitude but soon afterwards consulting Robertson's Elements of Navigation I found the island of Saint Ambrose there laid down in latitude ° ′ S and ° ″ longitude west of London and supposing that islands of so  small an extent might be laid down with more exactness in this work than in the chart I bore away more northward for that latitude the event however proved that I should not have trusted him so far I missed the islands and as I saw great numbers of birds and fish which are certain indications of land not far off there is the greatest reason to conclude that I went to the northward of them I am sorry to say that upon a farther examination of Robertson's tables of latitudes and longitudes I found them erroneous in many particulars this censure however if I had not thought it necessary to prevent future mischief should have been suppressed  Upon examining the account that is given by Wafer who was Surgeon on board Captain Davis's ship I think it is probable that these two islands are the land that Davis fell in with in his way to the southward from the Gallapago islands and that the land laid down in all the sea charts under the name of Davis's Land has no existence notwithstanding what is said in the account of Roggewein's voyage which was made in of land that they called Eastern Island which some have imagined to be a confirmation of Davis's discovery and the same land to which his name has been given  It is manifest from Wafer's narrative that little credit is due to the account kept on board Davis's ship except with respect to the latitude for he acknowledges that they had like to have perished by their making an allowance for the variation of the needle westward instead of eastward he tells us also that they steered S by E ½ E from the Gallapagos till they made land in latitude ° ′ S but it is evident that such a course would carry them not to the westward but to the eastward of the Gallapagos and set them at about the  distance of two hundred leagues from Capiapo and not five hundred leagues as he has alleged for the variation here is not more than half a point to the eastward now and it must have been still less then it having been increasing to the eastward on all this coast The course that Davis steered therefore if the distance between the islands of St Ambrose and St Felix and the Gallapagos as laid down in all our sea charts is right must have brought him within sight of St Ambrose and St Felix when he had run the distance he mentions The truth is that if there had been any such place as Davis's Land in the situation which has been allotted to it in our sea charts I must have sailed over it or at least have seen it as will appear in the course of this narrative  I kept between the latitude ° ′ and ° ′ in search of the islands I intended to examine till I got five degrees to the westward of our departure and then seeing no land and the birds having left us I hauled more to the southward and got into latitude ° ′ S where I continued till we got between seventeen and eighteen degrees to the westward of our departure In this parallel we had light airs and soul winds with a strong northerly current which made me conjecture that we were near this Davis's Land for which we looked out with great diligence but a fair wind springing up again we steered west by south which gradually brought us into the latitude of ° ½ S so that it is evident I must have sailed over this land or at least have seen it if there had been any such place I afterwards kept in the latitude of ° for forty degrees to the westward of my departure or according to my account degrees west of London this being the highest south latitude the winds and weather would permit me to keep so that I must have gone to the southward of the situation assigned to the supposed continent called Davis's Land in all our charts  We continued our search till Wednesday the th of June  when in latitude ° S longitude ° W we saw many sea birds which flew in flocks and some rock weed which made me conjecture that we were approaching or had passed by some land At this time the wind blew hard from the northward which made a great sea but we had notwithstanding long rolling billows from the southward so that whatever land was in that quarter could be only small rocky islands and I am inclined to believe that if there was land at all it was to the northward possibly it might be Roggewein's eastern island which he has placed in latitude ° S and which some geographers have supposed to be about seven hundred leagues distant from the continent of South America if indeed any credit is to be given to his account  It was now the depth of winter in these parts and we had hard gales and high seas that frequently brought us under our courses and low sails the winds were also variable and though we were near the tropic the weather was dark hazey and cold with frequent thunder and lightning sleet and rain The sun was above the horizon about ten hours in the four and twenty but we frequently passed many days together without seeing him and the weather was so thick that when he was below the horizon the darkness was dreadful the gloominess of the weather was indeed not only a disagreeable but a most dangerous circumstance as we were often long without being able to make an observation and were notwithstanding obliged to carry all the sail we could spread day and night our ship being so bad a sailer and our voyage so long to prevent our perishing by hunger which with all its concomitant horrors would otherwise be inevitable  A CHART AND VIEWS OF PITCAIRN  S ISLAND Latitude ° S Long ° W  map  bearing N W distance leagues  view  bearing N N W distance or leagues  view  bearing N W by N distance or leagues  view  bearing N N W distance leagues  view  We continued our course westward till the evening of Thursday the d of July  when we discovered land to the northward of us Upon approaching it the next day it appeared like a great rock rising out of the sea it was not more than five miles in circumference and seemed to be uninhabited it was however covered with trees and we saw a small stream of fresh water running down one side of it I would have landed upon it but the surf which at this season broke upon it with great violence rendered it impossible I got soundings on the west side of it at somewhat less than a mile from the shore in twentyfive fathom with a bottom of coral and sand and it is probable that in fine summer weather landing here may not only be practicable but easy We saw a great number of sea birds hovering about it at somewhat less than a mile from the shore and the sea here seemed to have fish It lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W and about a thousand leagues to the westward of the continent of America It is so high that we saw it at the distance of more than fifteen leagues and it having been discovered by a young gentleman son to Major Pitcairn of the marines who was unfortunately lost in the Aurora we called it PITCAIRN's ISLAND  While we were in the neighbourhood of this island the weather was extremely tempestuous with long rolling billows from the southward larger and higher than any I had seen before The winds were variable but blew chiefly from the S S W W and W N W We had very seldom a gale to the eastward so that we were prevented from keeping in a high south latitude and were continually driving to the northward  On the th  we found that the ship made a good deal of water for having been so long labouring in high  and turbulent seas  she was become very crazy our sails also being much worn were continually splitting so that it was become necessary to keep the sailmaker constantly at work The people had hitherto enjoyed good health but they now began to be affected with the scurvy While we were in the Streight of Magellan I caused a little awning to be made which I covered with a clean painted canvas that had been allowed me for a floorcloth to my cabbin and with this we caught so much rain water with but little trouble or attendance that the people were never put to a short allowance of this important article the awning also afforded shelter from the inclemency of the weather and to these precautions I imputed our having escaped the scurvy so long though perhaps it was in some measure owing to the mixture of spirit of vitriol with the water that was thus preserved our Surgeon putting a small quantity into every cask when it was filled up  On Saturday the th  we discovered a small low flat island which appeared to be almost level with the water's edge and was covered with green trees as it was to the south and directly to windward of us we could not fetch it It lies in latitude ° S and longitude ° ′ W and we called it the BISHOP OF OSNABURGH's ISLAND  in honour of his Majesty's second son  There is another island of this name among those that were discovered by Captain Wallis    On the th  we fell in with two more small islands which were covered with green trees but appeared to be uninhabited We were close in with the southermost which proved to be a slip of land in the form of a half moon low flat and sandy from the south end of it a reef runs out to the distance of about half a mile on which the sea breaks  with great fury We found no anchorage  but the boat landed It had a pleasant appearance but afforded neither vegetables nor water there were however many birds upon it so tame that they suffered themselves to be taken by hand The other island very much resembles this and is distant from it about five or six leagues they lie W N W and E S E of each other One of them is in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° W the other ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W and we called them the DUKE OF GLOUCESTER's ISLANDS  the variation here is five degrees east These islands are probably the land seen by Quiros as the situation is nearly the same but if not the land he saw could not be more considerable whatever it was we went to the southward of it and the long billows we had here convinced us that there was no land near us in that direction The wind here being to the eastward I hauled to the southward again and the next day Monday the th in the evening  as we were steering W S W we observed that we lost the long southerly billows and that we got them again at seven o'clock the next day When we lost them we were in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W and when we got them again we were in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ W so that I imagine there was then some land to the southward not far distant  From this time to the th  the winds were variable from N E round by the N the N W and S W and blew very hard with violent gusts one of which was very near being fatal to us with thick weather and hard rain We were then in latitude ° S and ° ′ W of our departure where we found the variation ° ′ E and the tempestuous gales were succeeded by a dead calm After some time however the wind sprung up again at west and at length settled in the W S W which soon drove us again to the northward so that on the th we were in latitude ° S  longitude ° ′ W of our departure the variation was here ° E  On the d  we were got into latitude ° S longitude ° W which was about one thousand eight hundred leagues to the westward of the continent of America and in all this track we had no indication of a continent The men now began to be very sickly the scurvy having made great progress among them and as I found that all my endeavours to keep in a high southern latitude at this time were ineffectual and that the badness of the weather the variableness of the winds and above all the defects of the ship rendered our progress slow I thought it absolutely necessary to fix upon that course which was most likely to preserve the vessel and the crew instead therefore of attempting to return back by the south east in which considering our condition and the advanced season of the year it was scarcely possible that we should succeed I bore away to the northward that I might get into the tradewind keeping still in such a track as if the charts were to be trusted was most likely to bring me to some island where the refreshments of which we stood so much in need might be procured intending then if the ship could be put into a proper condition to have pursued the voyage to the southward when the fit season should return to have attempted farther discoveries in this track and if I should discover a continent and procure a sufficient supply of provisions there to keep along the coast to the southward till the sun had crossed the equinoctial and then getting into a high southern latitude either have gone west about to the Cape of Good Hope or returned to the eastward and having touched at Falkland's Islands if necessary made the best of my way from thence back to Europe  When I got into latitude ° S and not before  I found the true tradewind and as we proceeded to the north west and the northward we found the variation increase very fast for when we had advanced to latitude ° ′ S and were in longitude ° ¼ W of our departure it was ° ′ E We had bad weather with hard gales and a great sea from the eastward till the th  when being in latitude ° ′ S we saw many birds flying in flocks and supposed ourselves to be near some land particularly several islands that are laid down in the charts and one which was seen by Commodore Byron in and called the Island of Danger none of these islands however could we see At this time it blew so hard that although we went before the wind we were obliged to reef our topsails and the weather was still very thick and rainy The next morning  being in latitude ° S longitude ° W we kept nearly in the same parallel in hopes to have fallen in with some of the islands called Solomon's Islands this being the latitude in which the southermost of them is laid down We had here the trade wind strong with violent squalls and much rain and continuing our course till Monday the d of August  we were then in latitude ° ′ S longitude by account ° ½ E our distance west from the continent of America about twentyone hundred leagues and we were five degrees to the westward of the situation of those islands in the charts It was not our good fortune however to fall in with any land probably we might pass near some which the thick weather prevented our seeing for in this run great numbers of seabirds were often about the ship however as Commodore Byron in his last voyage sailed over the northern limits of that part of the ocean in which the islands of Solomon are said to lie and as I sailed over the southern limits without seeing them there is great reason to conclude  that  if there are any such islands their situation in all our charts is erroneously laid down  From the latitude ° S longitude ° ′ W we had a strong gale from the S E which made a great sea after us and from that time I did not observe the long billows from the southward till we got into latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ E and then it returned from the S W and S S W and we found a current setting to the southward although a current in the contrary direction had attended us almost all the way from the Streight of Magellan I conjectured therefore that here the passage opened between New Zealand and New Holland The variation here was ° ′ E On the th  being in latitude ° ½ S longitude ° ′ E the variation was ° ′ E  and on the th in latitude ° S longitude ° ′ E it was ° ½ E  About this time we found our stock of loglines nearly expended though we had already converted all our fishing lines to the same use I was some time in great perplexity how to supply this defect but upon a very diligent enquiry found that we had by chance a few fathom of thick untarred rope This which in our situation was an inestimable treasure I ordered to be untwisted but as the yarns were found to be too thick for our purpose it became necessary to pick them into oakham and when this was done the most difficult part of the work remained for this oakham could not be spun into yarn till by combing it was brought into hemp its original state This was not seamen's work and if it had we should have been at a loss how to perform it for want of combs one difficulty therefore rose upon another and it was necessary to make combs before we could try our skill in making hemp Upon this trying occasion we were again sensible of the danger to which we  were exposed by the want of a forge necessity however the fruitful mother of invention suggested an expedient The armourer was set to work to file nails down to a smooth point with which we produced a tolerable succedaneum for a comb and one of the Quartermasters was found sufficiently skilled in the use of this instrument to render the oakham so smooth and even that we contrived to spin it into yarn as fine as our coarse implements would admit and thus we made tolerable loglines although we found it much more difficult than to make cordage of our old cables after they had been converted into junk which was an expedient that we had been obliged to practise long before We had also long before used all our sewing sail twine and if knowing that the quantity with which I had been supplied was altogether inadequate to the wants of such a voyage I had not taken the whole quantity that had been put on board to repair the seine into my own custody this deficiency might have been fatal to us all  CHAP IV  An Account of the Discovery of Queen Charlotte's Islands with a Description of them and their Inhabitants and of what happened at Egmont Island  THE scurvy still continued to make great progress among us and those hands that were not rendered useless by disease were worn down by excessive labour our vessel which at best was a dull sailer had been long in so bad a condition that she would not work and on the th  to render our condition still more distressful and alarming she sprung a leak in the bows which being under water it was impossible to get at while we were at sea Such was our situation  when on the th at break of day we discovered land the sudden transport of hope and joy which this inspired can perhaps be equalled only by that which a criminal feels who hears the cry of a reprieve at the place of execution The land proved to be a cluster of islands of which I counted seven and believe there were many more We kept on for two of them which were right ahead when land was first discovered and seemed to lie close together in the evening we anchored on the north east side of one of them which was the largest and the highest of the two in about thirty fathom with a good bottom and at the distance of about three cables' length from the shore We soon after saw too of the natives who were black with woolly heads and stark naked I immediately sent the Master out with the boat to fix upon a  QUEEN CHARLOTTE'S ISLANDS  map  map  wateringplace and speak to them  but they disappeared before she could reach the shore The boat soon after returned with an account that there was a fine run of fresh water abreast of the ship and close to the beach but that the whole country in that part being an almost impenetrable forest quite to the water's edge the watering would be very difficult and even dangerous if the natives should come down to prevent it that there were no esculent vegetables for the refreshment of the sick nor any habitations as far as the country had been examined which was wild forlorn and mountainous  Having considered this account and finding that a swell which came round the eastern part of the bay would render watering troublesome and inconvenient exclusive of the danger that might be apprehended from the natives if they should attack us from ambushes in the wood I determined to try whether a better situation could not be found  The next morning therefore as soon as it was light  I dispatched the Master with fifteen men in the cutter well armed and provided to examine the coast to the westward our present situation being on the lee of the island for a place where we might more conveniently be supplied with wood and water and at the same time procure some refreshments for the sick and lay the ship by the stern to examine and stop the leak I gave him some beads ribbons and other trifles which by chance I happened to have on board to conciliate the goodwill of the natives if he should happen to meet with any of them but at the same time enjoined him to run no risk and gave him particular orders immediately to return to the ship if any number of canoes should approach him which might bring on hostilities and if he should meet the Indians in small parties either at sea  or upon shore  to treat them with all possible kindness so as to establish a friendly intercourse with them charging him on no account to leave the boat himself nor to suffer more than two men to go on shore at a time while the rest stood ready for their defence recommending to him in the strongest terms an application to his duty without regarding any other object as the finding a proper place for the ship was of the utmost importance to us all and conjuring him to return as soon as this service should be performed with all possible speed  Soon after I had dispatched the cutter on this expedition I sent the longboat with ten men on board well armed to the shore who before eight o'clock brought off a tun of water About nine I sent her off again but soon after seeing some of the natives advancing along the shore towards the place where the men landed I made the signal for them to return not knowing to what number they would be exposed and having no boat to send off with assistance if they should be attacked  Our men had not long returned on board when we saw three of the natives sit down under the trees abreast of the ship As they continued there gazing at us till the afternoon as soon as the cutter came in sight not caring that both the boats should be absent at the same time I sent my Lieutenant in the longboat with a few beads ribbons and trinkets to endeavour to establish some kind of intercourse with them and by their means with the rest of the inhabitants these men however before the boat could reach the shore quitted their station and proceeded along the beach As the trees would soon prevent their being seen by our people who were making towards the land we kept our eyes fixed upon them from the ship and very soon perceived that they  were met by three others After some conversation  the first three went on and those who met them proceeded towards the boat with a hasty pace Upon this I made the signal to the Lieutenant to be upon his guard and as soon as he saw the Indians observing that there were no more than three he backed the boat in to the shore and making signs of friendship held up to them the beads and ribbons which I had given him as presents our people at the same time carefully concealing their arms The Indians however taking no notice of the beads and ribbons resolutely advanced within bowshot and then suddenly discharged their arrows which happily went over the boat without doing any mischief they did not prepare for a second discharge but instantly ran away into the woods and our people discharged some musquets after them but none of them were wounded by the shot Soon after this happened the cutter came under the ship's side and the first person that I particularly noticed was the Master with three arrows sticking in his body No other evidence was necessary to convict him of having acted contrary to my orders which appeared indeed more fully from his own account of the matter which it is reasonable to suppose was as favourable to himself as he could make it He said that having seen some Indian houses with only five or six of the inhabitants at a place about fourteen or fifteen miles to the westward of the ship's station where he had sounded some bays he came to a grappling and veered the boat to the beach where he landed with four men armed with musquets and pistols that the Indians at first were afraid of him and retired but that soon after they came down to him and he gave them some beads and other trifles with which they seemed to be much pleased that he then made signs to them for some cocoanuts which they brought him and with great appearance of friendship and  hospitality  gave him a broiled fish and some boiled yams that he then proceeded with his party to the houses which he said were not more than fifteen or twenty yards from the water side and soon after saw a great number of canoes coming round the western point of the bay and many Indians among the trees that being alarmed at these appearances he hastily left the house where they had been received and with the men made the best of his way towards the boat but that before he could get on board the Indians attacked as well those that were with him as those that were in the boat both from the canoes and the shore Their number he said was between three and four hundred their weapons were bows and arrows the bows were six feet five inches long and the arrows four feet four which they discharged in platoons as regularly as the best disciplined troops in Europe that it being necessary to defend himself and his people when they were thus attacked they fired among the Indians to favour their getting into their boat and did great execution killing many and wounding more that they were not however discouraged but continued to press forward still discharging their arrows by platoons in almost one continued flight that the grappling being foul occasioned a delay in hauling off the boat during which time he and half of the boat's crew were desperately wounded that at last they cut the rope and ran off under their foresail still keeping up their fire with blunderbusses each loaded with eight or ten pistol balls which the Indians returned with their arrows those on shore wading after them breast high into the sea when they had got clear of these the canoes pursued them with great fortitude and vigour till one of them was sunk and the numbers on board the rest greatly reduced by the fire and then they returned to the shore  Such was the story of the Master who  with three of my best seamen died some time afterwards of the wounds they had received but culpable as he appears to have been by his own account he appears to have been still more so by the testimony of those who survived him They said that the Indians behaved with the greatest confidence and friendship till he gave them just cause of offence by ordering the people that were with him who had been regaled in one of their houses to cut down a cocoanut tree and insisting upon the execution of his order notwithstanding the displeasure which the Indians strongly expressed upon the occasion as soon as the tree fell all of them except one who seemed to be a person of authority went away and in a short time a great number of them were observed to draw together into a body among the trees by a Midshipman who was one of the party that were on shore and who immediately acquainted the Master with what he had seen and told him that from the behaviour of the people he imagined an attack was intended that the Master made light of the intelligence and instead of repairing immediately to the boat as he was urged to do fired one of his pistols at a mark that the Indian who had till that time continued with them then left them abruptly and joined the body in the wood that the Master even after this by an infatuation that is altogether unaccountable continued to trifle away his time on shore and did not attempt to recover the boat till the attack was begun  As the expedition to find a better place for the ship had issued thus unhappily I determined to try what could be done where we lay the next day therefore  the ship was brought down by the stern as far as we could effect it and the carpenter the only one of the crew who  was in tolerable health  caulked the bows as far down as he could come at the bottom and though he did not quite stop the leak he very much reduced it In the afternoon a fresh gale set right into the bay which made the ship ride with her stern very near the shore and we observed a great number of the natives sculking among the trees upon the beach who probably expected that the wind would have forced the ship on shore  The next morning  the weather being fine we veered the ship close in shore with a spring upon our cable so that we brought our broadside to bear upon the wateringplace for the protection of the boats that were to be employed there As there was reason to suppose that the natives whom we had seen among the trees the night before were not now far distant I fired a couple of shot into the wood before I sent the waterers ashore I also sent the Lieutenant in the cutter well manned and armed with the boat that carried them and ordered him and his people to keep on board and lie close to the beach to cover the wateringboat while she was loading and to keep discharging musquets into the wood on each side of the party that were filling the water These orders were well executed the beach was sleep so that the boats could lie close to the people that were at work and the Lieutenant from the cutter fired three or four vollies of small arms into the woods before any of the men went on shore and none of the natives appearing the waterers landed and went to work But notwithstanding all these precautions before they had been on shore a quarter of an hour a flight of arrows was discharged among them one of which dangerously wounded a man that was filling water in the breast and another stuck into a bareca on which Mr Pitcairn was sitting The people on board the cutter immediately  fired several vollies of small arms into that part of the wood from which the arrows came  and I recalled the boats that I might more effectually drive the Indians from their ambuscades with grapeshot from the ship's guns When the boats and people were on board we began to fire and soon after saw about two hundred men rush out of the woods and run along the beach with the utmost precipitation We judged the coast to be now effectually cleared but in a little time we perceived that a great number had got together on the westermost point of the bay where they probably thought themselves beyond our reach to convince them therefore of the contrary I ordered a gun to be fired at them with round shot the ball just grazing the water rose again and fell in the middle of them upon which they dispersed with great hurry and confusion and we saw no more of them After this we watered without any farther molestation but all the while our boats were on shore we had the precaution to keep firing the ship's guns into the wood on both sides of them and the cutter which lay close to the beach as she did before kept up a constant fire of small arms in platoons at the same time As we saw none of the natives during all this firing we should have thought that none of them had ventured back into the wood if our people had not reported that they heard groans from several parts of it like those of dying men  Hitherto though I had been long ill of an inflammatory and bilious disorder I had been able to keep the deck but this evening the symptoms became so much more threatening that I could keep up no longer and I was for some time afterwards confined to my bed The Master was dying of the wounds he received in his quarrel with the Indians the Lieutenant also was very ill the Gunner and thirty of my men incapable of duty among whom were seven of the  most vigorous and healthy  that had been wounded with the Master and three of them mortally and there was no hope of obtaining such refreshments as we most needed in this place These were discouraging circumstances and not only put an end to my hopes of prosecuting the voyage farther to the southward but greatly dispirited the people except myself the Master and the Lieutenant there was no body on board capable of navigating the ship home the Master was known to be a dying man and the recovery of myself and the Lieutenant was very doubtful I would however have made a further effort to obtain refreshments here if I had been furnished with any toys iron tools or cutleryware which might have enabled me to recover the goodwill of the natives and establish a traffic with them for such necessaries as they could have furnished us with but I had no such articles and but very few others fit for an Indian trade and not being in a condition to risk the loss of any more of the few men who were capable of doing duty I weighed anchor at daybreak on Monday the th  and stood along the shore for that part of the island to which I had sent the cutter To the island I had given the name of EGMONT ISLAND  in honour of the Earl it certainly is the same to which the Spaniards have given the name of Santa Cruz as appears by the accounts which their writers have given of it and I called the place in which we had lain SWALLOW BAY From the eastermost point of this bay which I called SWALLOW POINT to the north east point of the island which I called CAPE BYRON is about seven miles east and from the westermost point of the bay which I called HANWAY's POINT to Cape Byron is about ten or eleven miles Between Swallow Point and Hanway's Point in the bottom of the bay there is a third point which does not run out so far and a little to the westward of this point  The North side of the largest of  Queen Charlotte's Islands  as it appeared running along shore to the Westward  view  The South side of a Vulcano Leagues North of the shore  view  map  Byron's Harbour  map  is the best anchoringplace  but it is necessary to give it birth as the ground near it is shoaly When we were at anchor in this bay Swallow Point bore E by N and Hanway's Point W N W From this Point there runs a reef on which the sea breaks very high the outer part of this reef bore N W by W and an island which has the appearance of a volcano was just over the breakers Soon after we had passed Hanway's Point we saw a small village which stands upon the beach and is surrounded by cocoanut trees It is situated in a bay between Hanway's Point and another to which I gave the name of HOW's POINT The distance from Hanway's Point to How's Point is between four and five miles close to the shore there is about thirty fathom of water but in crossing the bay at the distance of about two miles we had no bottom Having passed How's Point we opened another bay or harbour which had the appearance of a deep lagoon and which we called CARLISLE HARBOUR Overagainst the entrance of Carlisle Harbour and north of the coast we found a small island which we called PORTLAND's ISLAND On the west side of this island there is a reef of rocks that runs to the main the passage into the harbour therefore is on the east side of it and runs in and out E N E and W S W it is about two cables' length wide and has about eight fathom water I believe the harbour within it to be good but a ship would be obliged to warp both in and out and would after all be in danger of an attack by the natives who are bold even to temerity and have a perseverance which is not common among undisciplined savages When the ship was a mile from the shore we had no ground with fifty fathom About four or five miles west from Portland's Island is a fine small round harbour just big enough to receive three ships which we called BYRON's HARBOUR When we were abreast of the entrance of it it  bore from us S by E ½ E and the Volcano Island bore N W ½ W  Our boat entered it and found two runs of water one fresh and the other salt by the run of salt water we judged that it had a communication with Carlisle Harbour When we had proceeded about three leagues from the harbour we opened the bay where the cutter had been attacked by the Indians to which for that reason we gave the name of BLOODY BAY In this Bay is a small rivulet of fresh water and here we saw many houses regularly built close to the waterside stood one much longer than any of the rest which seemed to be a kind of commonhall or councilhouse and was neatly built and thatched This was the building in which our people had been received who were on shore here with the Master and they told me that both the sides and floor were lined with a kind of fine matting and a great number of arrows made up into bundles were hung up in it ready for use They told me also that at this place there were many gardens or plantations which were enclosed by a fence of stone and planted with cocoanut trees bananas plantains yams and other vegetables the cocoanut trees we saw from the ship in great numbers among the houses of the village About three miles to the westward of this town we saw another of considerable extent in the front of which next to the waterside there was a breastwork of stone about four feet six inches high not in a strait line but in angles like a fortification and there is great reason to suppose from the weapons of these people and their military courage which must in great measure be the effect of habit that they have frequent wars among themselves As we proceeded westward from this place we found at the distance of two or three miles a small bight forming a kind of bay in which a river empties itself Upon taking a view of this river from the masthead it appeared to run very far into the country  and at the entrance at least  to be navigable for small vessels This river we called GRANVILLE's RIVER and to the westward of it is a point to which we gave the name of FERRERS's POINT From this point the land forms a large bay and near it is a town of great extent which seemed to swarm like a beehive an incredible multitude came out of it as the ship passed by holding something in their hands which looked like a whisp of green grass with which they seemed to stroke each other at the same time dancing or running in a ring About seven miles to the westward of Point Ferrers is another that was called CARTERET POINT from which a reef of rocks that appears above water runs out to the distance of about a cable's length Upon this point we saw a large canoe with an awning or shade built over it and a little to the westward another large town fronted and probably surrounded with a breastwork of stone like the last here also the people thronged to the beach as the ship was passing and performed the same kind of circular dance After a little time they launched several canoes and made towards us upon which we lay to that they might have time to come up and we conceived great hopes that we should prevail upon them to come on board but when they came near enough to have a more distinct view of us they lay upon their paddles and gazed at us but seemed to have no design of advancing farther and therefore we made sail and left them behind us About half a mile from Carteret Point we had sixty fathom with a bottom of sand and coral From this point the land trends away W S W and S W forming a deep lagoon at the mouth of which lies an island that with the main forms two entrances into it the island we called TREVANION's ISLAND This entrance is about two miles wide and the lagoon if there is anchorage in it is certainly a fine harbour for shipping  After crossing the first entrance  and coming off the north west part of Trevanion's Island which we called CAPE TREVANION we saw a great rippling and therefore sent the boat off to sound we had however no bottom with fifty fathom the rippling being caused only by the meeting of the tides Having hauled round this Cape we found the land trend to the southward and we continued to stand along the shore till we opened the western passage into the lagoon between Trevanion's Island and the main In this place both the main and the island appeared to be one continued town and the inhabitants were innumerable We sent a boat to examine this entrance or passage and found the bottom to be coral and rock with very irregular soundings over it As soon as the natives saw the boat leave the ship they sent off several armed canoes to attack her the first that came within bowshot discharged her arrows at the people on board who being ready fired a volley by which one of the Indians was killed and another wounded at the same time we fired a great gun from the ship loaded with grapeshot among them upon which they all pulled back to the shore with great precipitation except the canoe which began the attack and that being secured by the boat's crew with the wounded man in her was brought to the ship I immediately ordered the Indian to be taken on board and the Surgeon to examine his wounds it appeared that one shot had gone through his head and that his arm was broken by another the Surgeon was of opinion that the wound in his head was mortal I therefore ordered him to be put again into his canoe and notwithstanding his condition he paddled away towards the shore He was a young man with a woolly head like that of the negroes and a small beard but he was wellfeatured and not so black as the natives of Guinea he was of the common stature and  like all the rest of the people whom we had seen upon this island quite naked His canoe was very small  and of rude workmanship being nothing more than part of the trunk of a tree made hollow it had however an outrigger but none of them had sails  We found this place to be the western extremity of the island on the north side and that it lay in exactly the same latitude as the eastern extremity on the same side The distance between them is about fifty miles due east and west and a strong current sets westward along the shore  I was still confined to my bed and it was with infinite regret that I gave up the hopes of obtaining refreshments at this place especially as our people told me they saw hogs and poultry in great plenty as we sailed along the shore with cocoanut trees plantains bananas and a variety of other vegetable productions which would soon have restored to us the health and vigour we had lost by the fatigue and hardships of a long voyage but no friendly intercourse with the natives could now be expected and I was not in a situation to obtain what I wanted by force I was myself dangerously ill great part of my crew as I have already observed was disabled and the rest dispirited by disappointment and vexation and if the men had been all in health and spirits I had not officers to lead them on or direct them in any enterprize nor even to superintend the duties that were to be performed on board the ship These disadvantages which prevented my obtaining refreshments at this island prevented me also from examining the rest that were near it Our little strength was every minute becoming less I was not in a condition to pursue the voyage to the southward and was in danger of losing the monsoon so that no time was now to be lost I therefore gave orders to  steer northward  hoping to refresh at the country which Dampier has called  Nova Britannia  I shall however give the best account I can of the appearance and situation of the islands that I left behind me  I gave the general name of QUEEN CHARLOTTE's ISLANDS to the whole cluster as well to those that I did not see distinctly as to those that I did and I gave several of them particular names as I approached them  To the southermost of the two which when we first discovered land were right ahead I gave the name of LORD HOW's ISLAND  and the other was Egmont Island of which some account has already been given The latitude of Lord How's Island is ° ′ S longitude ° ′ E the latitude of Cape Byron the north east point of Egmont island is ° ′ S longitude ° ′ E The east sides of these two islands which lie exactly in a line with each other about N by W and S by E including the passage between them extend about eleven leagues and the passage is about four miles broad both of them appear to be fertile and have a pleasant appearance being covered with tall trees of a beautiful verdure Lord How's Island though more flat and even than the other is notwithstanding high land About thirteen leagues W N W ½ N by compass from Cape Byron there is an island of a stupendous height and a conical figure The top of it is shaped like a funnel from which we saw smoke issue though no flame it is however certainly a volcano and therefore I called it VOLCANO ISLAND  To a long flat island that when How's and Egmont's Islands were right ahead bore N W I gave the name of KEPPEL's ISLAND  It lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude by account ° ′ E The largest of two others to the S E I called LORD EDGCOMB's ISLAND  the small one I called OURRY's  ISLAND Edgcomb's Island has a fine pleasant appearanceand lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ E The latitude of Ourry's Island is ° ′ S longitude ° ′ E The other islands of which there were several I did not particularly name  The inhabitants of Egmont Island whose persons have been described already are extremely nimble vigorous and active and seem to be almost as well qualified to live in the water as upon the land for they were in and out of their canoes almost every minute The canoes that came out against us from the west end of the island were all like that which our people brought on board and might probably upon occasion carry about a dozen men though three or four manage them with amazing dexterity we saw however others of a large size upon the beach with awnings or shades over them  We got two of their bows and a bundle of their arrows from the canoe that was taken with the wounded man and with these weapons they do execution at an incredible distance One of them went through the boat's washboard and dangerously wounded a midshipman in the thigh Their arrows were pointed with flint and we saw among them no appearance of any metal The country in general is woody and mountainous with many vallies intermixed several small rivers flow from the interior part of the country into the sea and there are many harbours upon the coast The variation here was about ° ′ E  CHAP V  Departure from Egmont Island and Passage to Nova Britannia with a Description of several other IsIands and their Inhabitants  WE made sail from this island in the evening of Tuesday the th of August  with a fresh tradewind from the eastward and a few squalls at times At first we only hauled up W N W for I was not without hope of falling in with some other islands where we might be more fortunate than we had been at those we left before we got the length of Nova Britannia  On the th  we discovered a small flat low island and got up with it in the evening it lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ E and I gave it the name of GOWER's ISLAND  To our great mortification we found no anchorage here and could procure only a few cocoanuts from the inhabitants who were much the same kind of people that we had seen at Isle Egmont in exchange for nails and such trifles as we had they promised by signs to bring us more the next day and we kept off and on all night the night was extremely dark  and the next morning at daybreak we found that a current had set us considerably to the southward of the island and brought us within sight of two more They were situated nearly east and west of each other and were distant about two miles That to the eastward is much the smallest and this we called SIMPSON's ISLAND  to the other which is lofty and has a stately appearance we gave  the name of CARTERET's ISLAND  The east end of it bears about south from Gower's Island and the distance between them is about ten or eleven leagues Carteret's Island lies in about the latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ E and its length from east to west is about six leagues we found the variation here ° ′ E Both these islands were right to windward of us and we bore down to Gower's Island It is about two leagues and a half long on the western side which makes in bays the whole is well wooded and many of the trees are cocoanut We found here a considerable number of the Indians with two boats or canoes which we supposed to belong to Carteret's Island and to have brought the people hither only to fish We sent the boat on shore which the natives endeavoured to cut off and hostilities being thus commenced we seized their canoe in which we found about an hundred cocoanuts which were very acceptable we saw some turtle near the beach but were not fortunate enough to take any of them The canoe or boat was large enough to carry eight or ten men and was very neatly built with planks well jointed it was adorned with shellwork and figures rudely painted and the seams were covered with a substance somewhat like our black putty but it appeared to me to be of a better consistence The people were armed with bows arrows and spears the spears and arrows were pointed with flint By some signs which they made pointing to our muskets we imagined they were not wholly unacquainted with firearms They are much the same kind of people as we had seen at Egmont Island and like them were quite naked but their canoes were of a very different structure and a much larger size though we did not discover that any of them had sails The cocoanuts which we got here and at Egmont Island were of infinite advantage to the sick  rom the time of our leaving Egmont Island we had observed a current setting strongly to the southward and in the neighbourhood of these islands we found its force greatly increased this determined me when I sailed from Gower's Island to steer N W fearing we might otherwise fall in with the main land too far to the southward for if we had got into any gulph or deep bay our crew was so sickly and our ship so bad that it would have been impossible for us to have got out again  About eight o'clock in the morning of the d  as we were continuing our course with a fine fresh gale Patrick Dwyer one of the marines who was doing something over the ship's quarter by some accident missed his hold and fell into the sea we instantly threw overboard the canoe which we had seized at Gower's island brought the ship to and hoisted out the cutter with all possible expedition but the poor fellow though remarkably strong and healthy sunk at once and we saw him no more We took the canoe on board again but she had received so much damage by striking against one of the guns as the people were hoisting her overboard that we were obliged to cut her up  In the night of Monday the th  we fell in with nine islands they stretch nearly N W by W and S E by E about fifteen leagues and lie in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ E according to the ship's account I imagine these to be the islands which are called Ohang Java and were discovered by Tasman for the situation answers very nearly to their place in the French chart which in the year was corrected for the King's ships The other islands Carteret's Gower's and Simpson's I believe had never been seen by an European navigator before There is certainly much land in this part of the ocean not yet known  One of these islands is of considerable extent  the other eight are scarcely better than large rocks but though they are low and flat they are well covered with wood and abound with inhabitants The people are black and woollyheaded like the Negroes of Africa their weapons are bows and arrows and they have large canoes which they navigate with a sail one of which came near us but would not venture on board  We went to the northward of these islands and steered W by S with a strong south westerly current At eleven o'clock at night we fell in with another island of a considerable extent flat green and of a pleasant appearance we saw none of its inhabitants but it appeared by the many fires which we saw in the night to be well peopled It lies in latitude ° ′ S and bears west fifteen leagues from the northermost of the Nine Islands and we called it SIR CHARLES HARDY's ISLAND  At daybreak the next morning  we discovered another large high island which rising in three considerable hills had at a distance the appearance of three islands We gave it the name of WINCHELSEA's ISLAND  it is distant from Sir Charles Hardy's Island about ten leagues in the direction of S by E We had here the wind squally with unsettled weather and a very strong westerly current  About ten o'clock in the morning of the th  we saw another large island to the northward which I supposed to be the same that was discovered by Schouten and called the island of Saint John Soon after we saw high land to the westward which proved to be Nova Britannia and as we approached it we found a very strong S S westerly current setting at the rate of no less than thirtytwo miles a day The next day having only light winds  a north westerly  current set us into a deep bay or gulph  which proved to be that which Dampier has distinguished by the name of Saint George's Bay  On the th  we anchored in a bay near a little island at the distance of about three leagues to the N W of Cape Saint George which was called WALLIS's ISLAND  I found the latitude of this Cape to be about ° S and its longitude by account ° ′ E which is about two thousand five hundred leagues due west from the Continent of America and about one degree and an half more to the eastward than its place in the French chart which has been just mentioned In the afternoon I sent the cutter to examine the coast and the other boat to get some cocoanuts and hawl the seine The people in this boat caught no fish but they brought on board about an hundred and fifty cocoanuts which were distributed to the men at the surgeon's discretion We had seen some turtle as we were coming into the bay and hoping that some of them might repair to the island in the night especially as it was sandy barren and uninhabited like the places these animals most frequent I sent a few men on shore to watch for them  but they returned in the morning without success  We anchored here only to wait till the boats could find a fit place for our purpose and several very good harbours being discovered not far distant we now endeavoured to weigh anchor but with the united strength of our whole company were not able this was an alarming proof of our debility and with heavy hearts we had recourse to an additional purchase with this assistance and our utmost efforts we got the anchor just clear of the bottom but the ship casting in shore it almost immediately hooked again in foul ground Our task was now to begin again and though all  The Island of  S  t  Jolm  bearing NNW leagues  view  Cape S  t  George  from w by N ° W distant leagues  view

the day with the greatest purchase we could make we were not able to stir it we were very unwilling to cut the cable for though it was much worn we could at this time ill sustain the loss of it as we intended to make small cord which we much wanted of the best part of it We therefore with whatever reluctance desisted for the night and the next day  having a little recruited our strength we were more successful we got the anchor up but we found it so much injured as to be wholly unserviceable the palm being broken  From this place we sailed to a little cove about three or four miles distant to which we gave the name of ENGLISH COVE here we anchored and immediately began to get wood and water which we found in great plenty besides ballast I also sent the boat out every day to different places with the seine but though there was plenty of fish we were able to catch very little a misfortune which was probably owing in part to the clearness of the water in part to the rockiness of the beach and perhaps in some degree also to our want of skill we plied this labour day and night notwithstanding the want of success and at the same time had recourse to the hook and line but to our great mortification not a single fish would take the bait We saw a few turtle but they were so shy that we could not catch one of them here therefore we were condemned to the curse of Tantalus perpetually in the sight of what our appetites most importunately craved and perpetually disappointed in our attempts to reach it We got however from the rocks at low water a few rock oysters and cockles of a very large size and from the shore some cocoanuts and the upper part of the tree that bears them which is called the cabbage this cabbage  is a white crisp juicy substance which eaten raw tastes somewhat like a chesnut but when boiled is superior to the best parsnip we cut it small into the broth that we made of our portable soup which was afterwards thickened with oatmeal and made a most comfortable mess for each of these cabbages however we were forced to cut down a tree and it was with great regret that we destroyed in the parent stock so much fruit which perhaps is the most powerful antiscorbutic in the world but necessity has no law This supply of fresh vegetables and especially the milk or rather the water of the nut recovered our sick very fast They also received great benefit and pleasure from the fruit of a tall tree that resembles a plum and particularly that which in the West Indies is called the Jamaica plum our men gave it the same name it has a pleasant tartish taste but is a little woody probably only for want of culture these plums were not plenty so that having the two qualities of a dainty scarcity and excellence it is no wonder that they were held in the highest estimation  The shore about this place is rocky and the country high and mountainous but covered with trees of various kinds some of which are of an enormous growth and probably would be useful for many purposes Among others we found the nutmeg tree in great plenty and I gathered a few of the nuts but they were not ripe they did not indeed appear to be the best sort but perhaps that is owing partly to their growing wild and partly to their being too much in the shade of taller trees The cocoanut tree is in great perfection but does not abound Here are I believe all the different kinds of palm with the beetlenut tree various species of the aloe canes bamboos and rattans with many trees shrubs and plants altogether unknown to me but no  esculent vegetable of any kind The woods abound with pigeons doves rooks parrots and a large bird with black plumage that makes a noise somewhat like the barking of a dog with many others which I can neither name nor describe Our people saw no quadruped but two of a small size that they took for dogs the carpenter and another man got a transient glimpse of them in the woods as they were cutting spars for the ship's use and said that they were very wild and ran away the moment they saw them with great swiftness We saw centipieds scorpions and a few serpents of different kinds but no inhabitants We fell in however with several deserted habitations and by the shells that were scattered about them and seemed not long to have been taken out of the water and some sticks half burnt the remains of a fire there is reason to conclude that the people had but just left the place when we arrived If we may judge of the people by that which had been their dwelling they must stand low even in the scale of savage life for it was the most miserable hovel we had ever seen  While we lay here having cleared and lightened the ship we heeled her so as to come at her leak which the carpenter stopped as well as he could we found the sheathing greatly decayed and the bottom much eaten by the worms but we payed it as far as we could get at it with a mixture of hot pitch and tar boiled together The carpenter also cut down many spars for studdingsail booms having but few left of those which he had brought from England  English Cove lies N E ½ N three or four miles from Wallis's Island there is a small shoal on the starboard hand going in which will be easily seen by the sea's breaking upon it The water ebbs and flows once in four and twenty hours the flood came in about nine or ten o'clock and it  was high water between three and four in the afternoon after which it ebbed all night and was low water about six in the morning The water rises and falls between eight or nine feet sometimes more sometimes less but I doubt whether this fluctuation is not rather the effect of the sea and land breeze than of a regular tide We anchored here with our best bower in twentyseven fathom water with a bottom of sand and mud we veered into the cove a cable and a half from the anchor moored head and stern with the stream anchor and steadied with hawsers on each bow the ship then lay in ten fathom at the distance of a cable's length from the shore at the bottom of the Cove Wallis's Point bearing S W ½ S distant about three or four miles At this place there is plenty of excellent wood and water and good shingle ballast The variation was ° ½ E  On Monday the th of September  I weighed anchor but before I sailed I took possession of this country with all its islands bays ports and harbours for his Majesty George the Third King of Great Britain and we nailed upon a high tree a piece of board faced with lead on which was engraved the English Union with the name of the ship and her Commander the name of the Cove and the time of her coming in and sailing out of it While we lay here I sent the boat out to examine the harbours upon the coast from one of which expeditions she returned with a load of cocoanuts which she procured in a fine little harbour about four leagues W N W from the station we were in The officer on board reported that the trees grew where he had gathered the fruit in great plenty but as he had observed that several of them were marked and that there were many huts of the natives near them I did not think it proper that the boat should return but the refreshment which now offered  was of such importance to the sick  that I determined to go into the harbour with the ship and place her so as to protect the men who should be employed to fell the trees and cut off the cabbages and the fruit We sailed from English Cove with the land breeze early in the morning and in the evening secured the ship abreast of the grove where the cocoanuts had been gathered and at very little distance from the shore Here we procured above a thousand cocoanuts and as many of the cabbages as we could use while they were good and I would have staid long enough to have given my people all the refreshments they wanted but the season of the year made the shortest delay dangerous There was too much reason to suppose that the lives of all on board depended upon our getting to Batavia while the monsoon continued to blow from the eastward there was indeed time enough for any other ship to have gone three times the distance but I knew it was scarcely sufficient for the Swallow in her present condition and that if we should be obliged to continue here another season it would probably become impossible to navigate her at all especially as she had but a single sheathing and her bottom was not filled with nails so that the worms would have eaten through it besides that our provision would long before that time have been totally exhausted I therefore weighed anchor and quitted this station which was much the best that had been our lot during the whole run from the Streight of Magellan on the th in the morning at break of day  with a light breeze from the land  To this place we gave the name of CARTERET's HARBOUR it is about W N W four leagues from English Cove and formed by two islands and the main the largest which is to the N W we called COCOANUT ISLAND and the other  which is to the S E we called LEIGH's ISLAND  Between these two islands there is shoal water and each of them forms an entrance into the harbour the south east or weather entrance is formed by Leigh's Island and in this there is a rock that appears above water to which we gave the name of BOOBY ROCK the passage is between the rock and the island nor is the rock dangerous there being deep water close to it The north west or lee entrance is formed by Cocoanut Island and this is the best because there is good anchorage in it the water in the other being too deep we entered the harbour by the south east passage and went out of it by the north west At the south east end of the harbour there is a large cove which is secure from all winds and fit to haul a ship into Into this cove a river seemed to empty itself but our boats did not examine it In the north west part of the harbour there is another cove which our boat did examine and from which she brought us very good water this also is fit for a ship to haul into and very convenient for wooding and watering she may lie in any depth from thirty to five fathom and at any distance from the shore with a bottom of soft mud The harbour runs about S E by S and N W by N and is about three miles long and four cables' length broad We anchored in thirty fathom near the north west entrance and abreast of the trees on Cocoanut Island  A

called Nova Britannia into two Islands with a Description of several small Islands that lie in the Passage and the Land on each Side with the Inhabitants  WHEN we got about four leagues off the land  after leaving this harbour we met with a strong gale at E S E a direction just contrary to that which would have favoured our getting round the land and doubling Cape Saint Maria We found at the same time a strong current setting us to the N W into a deep bay or gulph which Dampier calls Saint George's Bay and which lies between Cape Saint George and Cape Orford As it was impossible to get round the land against both the wind and current and follow the track of Dampier I was under the necessity of attempting a passage to the westward by this gulph and the current gave me hopes that I should succeed When I had got therefore about five miles to the south west of Cocoanut Island I steered to the NW and the N N W as the land trends and had soon good reason to believe that what has been called Saint George's Bay and thought to be formed by two points of the same island was indeed a channel between two islands and so the event proved it to be  Before it was dark we found this channel divided by a pretty large island which I called the DUKE OF YORK's ISLAND  and some smaller islands that were scattered about it  On the southermost side of the main or the largest of the two islands that are divided by the channel or streight which I left in possession of its ancient name New Britain there is some high land and three remarkable hills close to each other which I called the MOTHER AND DAUGHTERS The Mother is the middlemost and largest and behind them we saw a vast column of smoke so that probably one of them is a volcano they are easily seen in clear weather at the distance of twenty leagues and will then by those who do not know them be taken for islands they seem to lie far inland and the Mother bears about west from the Duke of York's Island To the east of these hills there is a point making like a cape land which I called CABE PALLISER and another to the westward which I called CAPE STEPHENS Cape Stephens is the northermost part of New Britain North of this Cape is an island which I called the ISLE OF MAN  Cape Palliser and Cape Stephens bear about N W and S E of each other and between them is a bay the land of which near the waterside is low pleasant and level and gradually rises as it retires towards the Mother and Daughters into very lofty hills in general covered with vast woods but having many clear spots like plantations intermixed Upon this part of the country we saw many fires in the night and have therefore reason to suppose that it is well inhabited The Duke of York's Island lies between the two points Cape Palliser and Cape Stephens As it was not safe to attempt either of the passages into which the Streight was divided by this island in the dark we brought to for the night and kept sounding but had no ground with one hundred and forty fathom The Streight here including the two passages is about fifteen leagues broad The land of the Duke of York's Island  is level and has a delightful appearance  inland it is covered with lofty woods and near the waterside are the houses of the natives which stand not far from each other among groves of cocoanut trees so that the whole forms a prospect the most beautiful and romantic that can be imagined We saw many of their canoes which are very neatly made and in the morning soon after I made sail  some of them came off towards the ship but as we had a fresh gale at that time we could not stay for them The latitude of this island is ° ′ S longitude ° ′ E and it is five and twenty leagues distant from Cape George As I coasted not New Britain but the northermost coast of the Streight I passed through the passage that is formed by that coast and the corresponding side of the Duke of York's Island which is about eight leagues broad and may be considered as the First Narrow of the Streight and then steering N W by W all night  we found at daybreak that we had lost sight of the southermost island or New Britain and having now ascertained the supposed bay to be a Streight I called it SAINT GEORGE's CHANNEL  and to the northern island I gave the name of NOVA HIBERNIA or NEW IRELAND The weather being hazey with a strong gale and sudden gusts I continued to steer along the coast of New Ireland at about the distance of six leagues from the shore till I came off the west end of it and then altering our course I steered W N W I could plainly perceive that we were set along the shore by a strong westerly current At noon we found by observation that we were much to the northward of the log but as it was impossible the current could set due north as that would be right against the land I was obliged for the correction of my account to allow no less than four and twenty miles W N W which is nearly as the land lies along the shore At this time we had about half a point  east variation  and at night we discovered a fine large island forming a streight or passage with New Ireland As it was very dark and squally with rain we brought to not knowing to what danger the navigation of this streight might expose us The night was tempestuous with much thunder and lightning  but about two in the morning the weather cleared the gusts settled into a light breeze and the the moon shone very bright At this time therefore we made sail again and found a strong current setting us to the westward through the passage of the Second Narrow which is about five leagues wide The island which has a pleasant appearance and is very populous I called SANDWICH ISLAND  in honour of the Earl now First Lord of the Admiralty it is larger than the Duke of York's Island and there seems to be some good bays and harbours upon the coast On the north part of it there is a remarkable peak like a sugar loaf and opposite to it upon the coast of New Ireland there is just such another they are distant about five leagues in the direction of S by E ½ E and N by W ½ W All the while we lay to off this island we heard an incessant noise in the night like the beating of a drum and being becalmed just as we got through the Streight ten canoes put off from New Ireland with about one hundred and fifty men on board and rowed towards the ship they came near enough to exchange some trifles with us which were conveyed at the end of a long stick but none of them would venture on board They seemed to prefer such iron as we gave them to every thing else though none of it was manufactured except nails for as I observed before we had no cutlery ware on board The canoes were very long and very narrow with an outrigger and some of them were very neatly made one of them could not be less than ninety feet long for it was very little shorter than the ship it was  notwithstanding formed of a single tree  it had some carved ornaments about it and was rowed or paddled by three and thirty men we saw no appearance of sails The people are black and woollyheaded like Negroes but have not the flat nose and thick lips and we thought them much the same people as the inhabitants of Egmont's Island like them they were all stark naked except a few ornaments made of shells upon their arms and legs They had however adopted a practice without which none of our belles and beaus are supposed to be completely drest for the hair or rather the wool upon their heads was very abundantly powdered with white powder the fashion of wearing powder therefore is probably of higher antiquity than it is generally supposed to be as well as of more extensive influence it is indeed carried farther among these people than among any of the inhabitants of Europe for they powder not only their heads but their beards too Their heads however were decorated with more showy ornaments for I observed that most of them had just above one ear stuck a feather which appeared to have been taken from the tail of the common dunghil cock so that these gentlemen are not without poultry for their table They were armed with spears and long sticks or poles like the quarterstaff but we did not see any bows and arrows among them possibly they might have them on board and think proper to keep them out of sight On my part I kept every body at their quarters while they were hovering about the ship and I observed that they had a very watchful eye upon our guns as if they apprehended danger from them so that possibly they are not wholly unacquainted with the effect of firearms They had fishing nets with them which as well as their cordage seemed to be very well made After they had  been some time with us  a breeze sprung up and they returned to the shore  The peak upon Sandwich Island lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ E After the Indians had left us we steered nearly west and soon after saw a point of land which proved to be the south west extremity of New Ireland to which I gave the name of CAPE BYRON  it lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ E Overagainst the coast of New Ireland to the westward of Cape Byron lies a fine large island to which I gave the name of NEW HANOVER  Between this island and New Ireland there is a streight or passage which turns away to the N E In this passage lie several small islands upon one of which there is a remarkable peak this island I called BYRON's ISLAND  and the passage or streight I called BYRON's STREIGHT The land of New Hanover is high it is finely covered with trees among which are many plantations and the whole has a most beautiful appearance The south west point of it which is a high bluff point I called QUEEN CHARLOTTE's FORELAND in honour of her Majesty This foreland and the land about it is remarkable for a great number of little hummocks or hills but night coming on with thick weather hard squalls and much rain we could not see more of it distinctly enough to describe its appearance  We steered westward all night  and in the morning the weather being still thick our view of New Hanover was very imperfect but we saw about eight leagues to the westward of it six or seven small islands which I called the DUKE OF PORTLAND's ISLANDS  two of which are pretty large I now perceived by the swell of the sea that we were clear of all the land and I found Saint George's Channel to  be a much better and shorter passage  whether from the eastward or the westward than round all the land and islands to the northward the distress therefore which pushed me upon this discovery may probably be in its consequences of great advantage to future navigators especially as there can be no doubt but that refreshments of every kind may easily be procured from the natives who inhabit either of the coasts of the channel or the islands that lie near them for beads ribands lookingglasses and especially iron tools and cutleryware of which they are immoderately fond and with which to our great misfortune we were not furnished  Queen Charlotte's Foreland the south west part of New Hanover lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ E and the middle of Portland's Islands in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ E The length of this streight or channel from Cape Saint George to Cape Byron the south west extremity of New Ireland is above eighty leagues the distance from Cape Byron to Queen Charlotte's Foreland is about twelve leagues and from the Foreland to Portland's Islands about eight leagues so that the whole length of Saint George's Channel is about one hundred leagues or three hundred miles  Though we cleared the Streight in the morning of Sunday the th of September we had no observation of the sun till the th which I could not but greatly regret as it prevented my being so exact in my latitude and longitude as might be expected The description also of the country its productions and people would have been much more full and circumstantial if I had not been so much infeebled and dispirited by sickness as almost to sink under the duty that for want of officers devolved upon me being obliged when I was scarcely able to crawl to keep watch and watch and  share other duties with my Lieutenant  whose health also was greatly impaired  CHAP VII  The Passage from Saint George's Channel to the Island of Mindanao with an Account of many Islands that were seen and Incidents that happened by the Way  AS soon as we had cleared Saint George's Channel we steered westward and the next day we discovered land bearing W N W and hauled up for it it proved to be an island of considerable extent and soon afterwards we saw another to the north east of it but this appeared to be little more than a large rock above water As I had here strong currents and for several days had not been able to get an observation of the sun I cannot so exactly ascertain the situation of these islands as I might otherwise have done As we proceeded to the westward we discovered more land consisting of many islands lying to the southward of the large one which we had first discovered As the nights were now moonlight we kept on till eleven o'clock and the Lieutenant who was then officer of the watch finding that the course we were steering would carry us among them and not being willing to awaken me till it was my turn to watch hauled off S by E and S S E I came upon deck about midnight  and at one in the morning perceiving that we were clear of them I bore away again to the westward with an easy sail the islands however were not far distant and about six o'clock a considerable number of canoes with several hundred people on board came off and paddled  toward the ship one of them with seven men on board  came near enough to hail us and made us several signs which we could not perfectly understand but repeated as near as we could to shew that whatever they meant to us we meant to them however the better to bespeak their goodwill and invite them on board we held up to them several of the few trifles we had upon this they drew nearer to the ship and I flattered myself that they were coming on board but on the contrary as soon as they came within reach of us they threw their lances with great force where we stood thickest upon the deck As I thought it better to prevent than to repress a general attack in which as the number would be more the mischief would be greater and having now no doubt of their hostile intentions I fired some muskets and one of the swivel guns upon which some of them being killed or wounded they rowed off and joined the other canoes of which there were twelve or fourteen with several hundred men on board I then brought to waiting for the issue and had the satisfaction to see that after having long consulted together they made for the shore that I might still farther intimidate them and more effectually prevent their return I fired a round shot from one of my sixpounders so as to fall into the water beyond them this seemed to have a good effect for they not only used their paddles more nimbly but hoisted sail still standing towards the shore Soon after however several more canoes put off from another part of the island and came towards us very fast they stopped at about the same distance as the other had done and one of them also in the same manner came forward to the people on board this vessel we made all the signs of friendship we could devise shewing them every thing we had which we thought would please them opening our arms and inviting them on board but  our rhetoric was to no effect  for as soon as they came within a cast of the ship they poured in a shower of darts and lances which however did us no harm We returned the assault by firing some muskets and one man being killed the rest precipitately leaped into the sea and swimming to the others who waited at a distance all returned together from whence they came As soon as the canoe was deserted we got out our boat and brought it on board it was full fifty feet long though one of the smallest that came against us it was very rudely made out of one tree but had an outrigger We found in it six fine fish and a turtle some yams one cocoanut and a bag full of a small kind of apple or plum of a sweetish taste and farinaceous substance it had a flattish kernel and was wholly different from every thing we have seen either before or since it was eatable raw but much better boiled or roasted in the embers we found also two large earthen pots shaped somewhat like a jug with a wide mouth but without handles and a considerable quantity of matting which these people use both for sails and awning spreading it over bent sticks much in the same manner as the tilts of the London wherries From the contents of this vessel we judged that it had been fishing and we observed that the people had a fire on board with one of their pots on it in which they were boiling their provision When we had satisfied our curiosity by examining it we cut it up for firewood  These Indians were the same kind of people that we had seen before on the coast of New Ireland and at Egmont Island they were of a very dark copper colour nearly black with woolly heads They chew beetlenut and go quite naked except the rude ornaments of shells strung together which they wear round their legs and arms they were also powdered  Three Views of the ADMIRALTY ISLES  views  Two

lances were pointed with a kind of bluish flint  Having disengaged ourselves from this fierce and unfriendly people we pursued our course along the other islands which are between twenty and thirty in number and of considerable extent one in particular would alone make a large kingdom I called them the ADMIRALTY ISLANDS  and should have been glad to have examined them if my ship had been in a better condition and I had been provided with such articles as are proper for an Indian trade especially as their appearance is very inviting they are clothed with the most beautiful verdure the woods are lofty and luxuriant interspersed with spots that have been cleared for plantations groves of cocoanut trees and houses of the natives who seem to be very numerous Nothing would be more easy than to establish an amicable intercourse with them as they would soon be sensible that our superiority would render contest vain and traffic advantageous I judge the middle of the largest to lie in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ E and at the distance of five and thirty leagues from Queen Charlotte's Foreland in New Hanover in the direction of W ½ N On the south side of this island there is a small one which rises conically in a high peak The latitude of this peak is ° ′ S and it lies five degrees and an half westward of Cape Saint George in New Ireland As we ran along the south side of the large island we found it to be eighteen leagues long in the direction of east and west how far it runs to the northward I do not know but by its appearance there is reason to suppose a very considerable distance I think it probable in the highest degree that these islands produce many valuable  articles of trade  particularly spices especially as they lie in the same climate and latitude as the Malaccas and as I found the nutmegtree in a soil comparatively rocky and barren upon the coast of New Ireland  Having passed these islands we continued our course W by N with a fine eastern breeze and smooth water On the th in the morning  we found the variation by a medium of several azimuths to be ° ′ E our latitude being ° ′ S and our longitude ° ′ E by observation I was surprised to find the variation on this side the land of New Britain and New Ireland so much as we had found it gradually decreasing during our progress to the N W but I recollected that about two years before I had found nearly the same variation in this meridian about the island of Tinian  On Saturday evening the th  we discovered two small islands both low land level and green one of them we saw only from the maintopgallantmast head this I called DUROUR's ISLAND  Its latitude is about ° ′ or ′ S its longitude ° ′ E The other island which I called MATTY's ISLAND  we coasted during the night and saw the inhabitants in great numbers run along the beach abreast of the ship with lights the side along which we sailed seemed to be about six miles in length E by N and W by S As it was dark we could see no more of it and having a fine breeze which we could not afford to lose we kept on Its latitude is about ° ′ S and its longitude about ° ′ E the variation here was ° ′ E and we found a strong north westerly current We had now fresh gales and squalls with rain the wind blowing very unsteadily from E S E to E N E till the d  when it became variable Our latitude was then ′ S longitude ° ′ E the variation was ° ′ E  On the th we saw two small islands to the south west  but it being calm with light airs and a strong westerly current we could not get nearer to them than four or five leagues they had a green pleasant appearance and were well covered with trees but whether they are inhabited I do not know They run about N W by W S E by E One is about three miles long and the other about six the passage between them appeared to be about two miles broad They lie in latitude ′ S longitude ° ′ E and I gave them the name of STEPHENS's ISLANDS We kept steering N W by W with a light variable wind and a strong north west current  On the th we saw land ahead  which proved to be three small islands and before it was dark we got pretty near them Several canoes soon came off filled with the natives who after making signs of peace came on board without the least appearance of fear or distrust they had nothing with them but a few cocoanuts which they sold with great joy for a few pieces of an iron hoop we soon found that they were not unacquainted with that metal which they called  Parram  and they made us understand by signs that a ship like ours sometimes touched at their islands for refreshment I gave one of them three pieces of an old iron hoop each about four inches long which threw him into an extasy little short of distraction I could not but sympathize in his joy nor observe without great pleasure the changes of countenance and extravagance of gesture by which it was expressed All these people indeed appeared to be more fond of iron than any we had seen before and I am sure that for iron tools we might have purchased every thing upon the islands which we could have brought away They are of the Indian copper colour the first of that complexion  that we had seen in these parts  with fine long black hair and little beards for we observed that they were continually plucking the hair from their chin and upper lip by the roots Their features are pleasing and their teeth remarkably white and even they were of the common stature but nimble vigorous and active in a surprising degree running up to the masthead much faster than our own people Their disposition was free and open they eat and drank whatever was given them went without hesitation into every part of the ship and were as familiar and merry with the crew as if they had been of long and intimate acquaintance They were not like the people on all the other islands that we had visited quite naked though they had only a slight covering for the waist which consisted of a narrow piece of fine matting Their canoes were very well and neatly made having a hollow tree for the bottom and planks for the sides with a sail of fine matting and an outrigger their ropes and netting were also very good They urged us strongly to go on shore offering to leave an equal number of their own people behind as a pledge of their safe return and indeed I would gladly have consented if it had been in my power but a strong westerly current hurried me to so great a distance that I had no opportunity to seek for anchorage and night coming on we pursued our course When our visitors perceived this one of them insisted upon going with us and notwithstanding all that I and his companions could say or do obstinately refused to go on shore As I thought it possible that this man might be the means of our making some useful discovery I did not put him ashore by force but indulged him in his desire we learnt from him that there were other islands to the northward the inhabitants of which he said had iron and always  A Dangerous Shoal seen Sept  r  the  map  Joseph Freewills Islands  map  THE SOUTH END OF MINDANAO  map  killed his countrymen when they could catch them out at sea  It was with great concern that I perceived this poor fellow whom I called Joseph Freewill from his readiness to go with us become gradually sickly after he had been some time at sea he lived till I got to the island of Celebes and there died As the islands from which I had taken him were very small and low the largest being not more than five miles in compass I was surprised to see with how many of the productions of Celebes he was acquainted beside the cocoanut and palm he knew the beetlenut and the lime and the moment he got a breadfruit he went to the fire and roasted it in the embers He made us understand also that in his country they had plenty of fish and turtle in their season It is however very probable notwithstanding the number of people who subsist upon these islands that they have no fresh water but what falls in rain how they catch and preserve it I had no opportunity to learn but I never met with a spring in a spot so small and low and in such a spot I believe no spring was ever found The largest of these islands which the natives call Pegan and to which I gave the name of FREEWILL ISLAND  lies fifty minutes north of the line and in ° ′ east longitude They are all surrounded by a reef of rocks The chart of these islands I drew from the Indians' description who delineated them with chalk upon the deck and ascertained the depth of water by stretching his arms as a fathom  I now steered N W by N to get from under the sun and had light winds at E S E with which almost any ship but the Swallow would have made good way but with every possible advantage she went at a heavy rate We now found our variation begin again to decrease as will appear by the following table  Latitude  Longitude from Queen Charlotte's Foreland  Variation  ′ S  ° ′ W  ° ′ E  Upon the line  W  E  ′ N  W  E  ° N  W  E  ° ′ N  W  E  On the th  being in latitude ° ′ N longitude ° ′ E we fell in with a very dangerous shoal which is about eleven or twelve miles in circuit and surrounded with small stones that just shew themselves above water We found here a strong northerly current but could not determine whether it inclined to the east or west  In the evening we discovered from the masthead another island to the southward of us the east end of it seemed to rise in a peak and had the appearance of a sail but we did not go near enough to see any thing of it from the deck I suppose its latitude to be about ° ′ N and its longitude east of London about ° ′ E  We continued to have a current to the northward till Monday the th of October  when being in latitude ° ′ N I found it southerly and very strong I had among other deficiencies and misfortunes no small boat on board so that I could not try these currents which I had a great desire to do but I am of opinion that when the current set southward it inclined to the east and that when it set northward it inclined to the west  On Monday the th  we discovered a small island with trees upon it though scarcely bigger than a rock and I called it CURRENT ISLAND  It lies in latitude ° ′ N longitude ° ′ W of Queen Charlotte's Foreland The next day we discovered two other small islands which  I called SAINT ANDREW's ISLANDS  they lie in latitude ° ′ N longitude ° ′ W of Queen Charlotte's Foreland I called the small island Current island because we had here a southerly current so strong that it set us from twentyfour to thirty miles southward every day besides the difference it might make in our longitude The wind was now variable blowing by turns from every point in the compass with much rain and hard squalls On Tuesday the th  being in latitude ° N it blew with such violence that we were obliged to lie to sixtyfour hours This gale which made a very great sea I supposed to be the shifting of the monsoon and notwithstanding the southerly current it drove us while we lay to as far as nine degrees northward  CHAP VIII  Some Account of the Coast of Mindanao and the Islands near it in which several Mistakes of Dampier are corrected  ON the th we discovered land again  but not being able to make an observation we could ascertain our latitude and longitude only by our dead reckoning the next day  however was more favourable and I then found the effect of the current had been so great that I was obliged to add to the log S W by S no less than miles for the last two days We now knew that the land we had seen was the north east part of the island of Mindanao as I had many sick people on board and was in the most pressing need of refreshments  I determined to try what could be procured in a bay which Dampier has described as lying on the south east part of the island  and which he says furnished him with great plenty of deer from a savannah I therefore coasted that side of the island and that I might be sure not to miss the bay I sent out the Lieutenant with the boat and a proper number of hands to keep in shore ahead of the ship No such bay however was to be found but at the very southermost extremity of the island they opened a little nook at the bottom of which was a town and a fort As soon as our boat was discovered by the people on shore they fired a great gun and sent off three boats or canoes full of people As the Lieutenant had not a sufficient force to oppose them he immediately made towards the ship and the canoes chaced him till they came within sight of her and being then overmatched in their turn they thought fit to go back Being thus disappointed in my search of Dampier's Bay and Savannah I would have anchored off this town notwithstanding these hostile appearances if it had not been necessary first to get up some guns from the hold and make a few necessary repairs in the rigging this however being the case  I ran a little to the eastward where on the d of November I came to an anchor in a little bay having a bottom of soft mud and seven fathom of water at the distance of a cable's length from the shore the westermost point of the bay bore W S W distant about three miles the eastermost point E by S distant about one mile a river which empties itself into the bay about N W and the peak of an island called Hummock Island S ° E distant about five leagues Before it was dark the same day our two boats went to the river and brought off their loads of water they saw no signs of inhabitants where they were on shore but we observed a canoe come round the westermost point of the  bay which we supposed had been dispatched from the town  to learn what we were or at least to see what we were doing As soon as I discovered this canoe I hoisted English colours and was not without hope that she would come on board but after viewing us some time she returned As we had seen no inhabitants nor any signs of inhabitants where we got our water I intended to procure a further supply the next day from the same place and endeavour also to recruit our wood but about nine o'clock at night we were suddenly surprised by a loud noise on that part of the shore which was abreast of the ship it was made by a great number of human voices and very much resembled the warwhoop of the American Savages a hideous shout which they give at the moment of their attack and in which all who have heard it agree there is something inexpressibly terrifying and horrid  As I was now farther convinced that it was necessary to dispose of our little force to the greatest advantage we began the next day by getting the guns up from the hold  and making the necessary repairs to our rigging At eleven o'clock not having seen any thing of the people who had endeavoured to terrify us by their yells in the night I sent the longboat on shore for more water but as I thought it probable that they might have concealed themselves in the woods I kept the cutter manned and armed with the Lieutenant on board that immediate succour might be sent to the waterers if any danger should threaten them It soon appeared that my conjectures were well founded for our people had no sooner left their boat than a number of armed men rushed out of the woods one of whom held up somewhat white which I took to be a signal of peace Upon this occasion I was again sensible of the mortifying deficiency in the ship's equipment which I had so often experienced  before  I had no white flag on board and therefore as the best expedient in my power I ordered the Lieutenant whom I sent on shore in the cutter to display one of my tablecloths as soon as the officer landed the standardbearer and another came down to him unarmed and received him with great appearance of friendship One of them addressed him in Dutch which none of our people understood he then spoke a few words in Spanish in which one of the persons of the cutter was a considerable proficient the Indian however spoke it so very imperfectly that it was with great difficulty and by the help of many signs he made himself understood possibly if any of our people had spoken Dutch he might have been found equally deficient in that language He asked for the Captain however by the name of the skipper and enquired whether we were Hollanders whether our ship was intended for merchandize or for war how many guns and men she carried and whether she had been or was going to Batavia When we had satisfied him in all these particulars he said that we should go to the town and that he would introduce us to the Governor whom he distinguished by the title of Raja The Lieutenant then told him that we intended to go to the town but that we were in immediate want of water and therefore desired permission to fill some casks he also requested that the people who were armed with bows and arrows might be ordered to a greater distance With both these requisitions the Indian who seemed to be invested with considerable authority complied and as he seemed to take particular notice of a silk handkerchief which the Lieutenant had tied round his neck it was immediately presented to him in return for which he desired him to accept a kind of cravat made of coarse callico which was tied round his own his dress being somewhat  after the Dutch fashion After this interchange of cravats  he enquired of the officer whether the ship was furnished with any articles for trade to which he answered that she was sufficiently furnished to trade for provisions but nothing more the Chief replied that whatever we wanted we should have After this conference which I considered as an earnest of every advantage which this place could afford us the boats returned on board laden with water and we went cheerfully on with our business on board the ship In about two hours however we saw with equal surprise and concern many hundreds of armed men posting themselves in parties at different places among the trees upon the beach abreast of the ship their weapons were musquets bows and arrows long pikes or spears broad swords a kind of hanger called a cress and targets we observed also that they hauled a canoe which lay under a shed upon the beach up into the woods These were not friendly appearances and they were succeeded by others that were still more hostile for these people spent all the remainder of the day in entering and rushing out of the woods as if they had been making sallies to attack an enemy sometimes shooting their arrows and throwing their lances into the water towards the ship and sometimes lifting their targets and brandishing their swords at us in a menacing manner In the mean time we were not idle on board we got up our guns repaired our rigging and put every thing in order before evening and then being ready to sail I determined if possible to get another conference with the people on shore and learn the reason of so sudden and unaccountable a change of behaviour The Lieutenant therefore was again dispatched and as a testimony that our disposition was still peaceable the tablecloth was again displayed as a flag of truce I had the precaution however to order the boat  to a part of the beach which was clear of wood  that the people on board might not be liable to mischief from enemies whom they could not see I also ordered that nobody should go on shore When the Indians saw the boat come to the beach and observed that nobody landed one of them came out of the wood with a bow and arrows in his hand and made signs for the boat to come to the place where he stood This the officer very prudently declined as he would then have been within bowshot of an ambuscade and after waiting some time and finding that a conference could be procured upon no other terms he returned back to the ship It was certainly in my power to have destroyed many of these unfriendly people by firing my great guns into the wood but it would have answered no good purpose we could not afterwards have procured wood and water here without risking the loss of our own people and I still hoped that refreshment might be procured upon friendly terms at the town which now I was in a condition to defend myself against a sudden assault I resolved to visit  The next morning therefore  as soon as it was light I sailed from this place which I called DECEITFUL BAY with a light land breeze and betweeen ten and eleven o'clock we got off the bay or nook at the bottom of which our boats had discovered the town and fort It happened however that just at this time the weather became thick with heavy rain and it began to blow hard from a quarter which made the land here a lee shore this obliged me to stand off and having no time to lose I stood away to the westward that I might reach Batavia before the season was past  I shall now give a more particular account of our navigating the sea that washes the coasts of this island the rather as Dampier's description is in several particulars erroneous  Having seen the north east part of the island on the twentysixth of October without certainly knowing whether it was Mindanao or Saint John's we got nearer to it the next day and made what we knew to be Saint Augustina the south eastermost part of the island which rises in little hummocks that run down to a low point at the water's edge it bears N E at the distance of two and twenty leagues from a little island which is distinguished from the other islands that lie off the southermost point of Mindanao by a hill or hummock and which for that reason I called HUMMOCK ISLAND All this land is very high one ridge of mountains rising behind another so that at a great distance it appears not like one island but several After our first discovery of the island we kept turning along the east side from the northward to Cape Saint Augustina nearly S by W ½ W and N by E ½ E for about twenty leagues The wind was to the southward along the shore and as we approached the land we stood in for an opening which had the appearance of a good bay where we intended to anchor but we found that it was too deep for our purpose and that some shoals rendered the entrance of it dangerous To this bay which lies about eight or ten leagues N by E from Cape Saint Augustina the south east extremity of the island I gave the name of DISAPPOINTMENT BAY When we were in the offing standing in for this Bay we observed a large hummock which had the appearance of an island but which I believe to be a peninsula joined by a low isthmus to the main this hummock formed the northermost part of the entrance and another high bluff point opposite to it formed the southermost part between these two points are the shoals that have been mentioned and several small islands only one of which can be seen till they are approached very near On this part of the  coast we saw no signs of inhabitants the land is of a stupendous height with mountains piled upon mountains till the summits are hidden in the clouds in the offing therefore it is almost impossible to estimate its distance for what appear then to be small hillocks just emerging from the water in comparison of the mountains that are seen over them swell into high hills as they are approached and the distance is found to be thrice as much as it was imagined perhaps this will account for the land here being so ill laid down and in situations so very different as it appears to be in all our English charts We found here a strong current setting to the southward along the shore as the land trended The high land that is to the north of Saint Augustina becomes gradually lower towards the Cape a low flat point in which it terminates and off which at a very little distance lie two large rocks Its latitude is ° ′ N and the longitude by account ° ′ E  From this Cape the land trends away W and W by S for six or seven leagues and then turns up to the N W making a very deep bay the bottom of which as we crossed it from Saint Augustina to the high land on the other side which is not less than twelve leagues we could not see The coast on the farther side of it coming up from the bottom trend first to the S and S S W and then to the S W by W towards the south extremity of the island  Off this southern extremity which Dampier calls the south east by mistake the south east being Saint Augustina at the distance of five six and seven leagues lie ten or twelve islands though Dampier says there are only two and that together they are about five leagues round The islands that I saw could not be contained in a circuit of less than fifteen leagues and from the number of boats that I saw  among them I imagine they are well inhabited The largest of these lies to the S W of the others and makes in a remarkable peak so that it is first seen in coming in with the land and is indeed visible at a very great distance Its latitude I make ° ′ N and its longitude by account ° ′ E This island which I called HUMMOCK ISLAND  bears from Saint Augustina S W at the distance of between twenty and two and twenty leagues and from the same Cape the southermost part of the island Mindanao bears S W ¾ W at the distance of between twentyone and twentythree leagues This southermost extremity consists of three or four points which bear east and west of each other for about seven miles They lie in latitude ° ′ N longitude ° ′ E according to my account The variation here was one point east  I passed between these Islands and the main and found the passage good the current setting to the westward Dampier has placed his Bay and Savannah four leagues N W from the eastermost island and there I sought it as indeed I did on all the S E part of the island till we came to the little creek which ran up to the town  All the southern part of Mindanao is extremely pleasant with many spots where the woods had been cleared for plantations and fine lawns of a beautiful verdure this part also is well inhabited as well as the neighbouring islands Of the town I can give no account as the weather was so thick that I could not see it neither could I sufficiently distinguish the land to set off the points at which I was not a little mortified  When I came to open the land to the westward of the southermost point I found it trend from that point W N W and N W by W forming first a point at the distance of  about seven or eight leagues and then a very deep bay running so far in to the N and N E that I could not see the bottom of it The westermost point of this bay is low but the land soon rises again and runs along to the N W by W which seems to be the direction of this coast from the southermost point of the island towards the city of Mindanao  To the westward of this deep bay the land is all flat and in comparison of the other parts of the island but thinly wooded Over this flat appears a peak of stupendous height which rises into the clouds like a tower Between the entrance of this bay and the south point of the island there is another very high hill the top of which has the funnel shape of a volcano but I did not perceive that it emitted either fire or smoke It is possible that this deep bay is that which Dampier mentions and that it is misplaced by an error of the press for if instead of saying it bore N W  four  leagues from the  eastermost  of the islands he had said it bore N W  fourteen  leagues from the  westermost  of the islands it would correspond well with his description the bearings being the same and the land on the east side of it high and low on the west he is also nearly right in the latitude of his islands which he makes ° ′ N for probably some parts of the southermost of them may lie in that latitude but as I did not go to the southward of them this is only conjecture  Between Hummock Island which is the largest and westermost of them and the islands to the eastward of it which are all flat and even is a passage running north and south which appears to be clear The north eastermost of these islands is small low and flat with a white sandy beach all round it and a great many trees in the middle  East or north east of this island there are shoals and breakers and I saw no other appearance of danger in these parts Neither did I see any of the islands which are mentioned by Dampier and laid down in all the charts near Mindanao in the offing perhaps they are at a more remote distance than is commonly supposed for without great attention navigators will be much deceived in this particular by the height of the land as I have observed already As I coasted this island I found the current set very strong to the southward along the shore till I came to the south end of it where I found it run N W and N W by W which is nearly as the land trends We had the winds commonly from S W to N W with light airs frequent rain and unsettled weather  We now bid farewel to Mindanao greatly disappointed in our hope of obtaining refreshments which at first the inhabitants so readily promised to furnish We suspected that there were Dutchmen or at least Dutch partisans in the town and that having discovered us to be English they had dispatched an armed party to prevent our having any intercourse with the natives who arrived about two hours after our friendly conference and were the people that defied us from the shore  CHAP IX  The Passage from Mindanao to the Island of Celebes with a particular Account of the Streight of Macassar in which many Errors are corrected  AFTER leaving Mindanao  I stood to the westward for the passage between the islands of Borneo and Celebes called the Streight of Macassar and made it on Saturday the fourteenth I observed that during the whole of this run we had a strong north westerly current but that while we were nearer to Mindanao than Celebes it ran rather towards the north than the west and that when we came nearer to Celebes than we were to Mindanao it ran rather towards the west than the north The land of Celebes on the north end runs along to the entrance of the passage is very lofty and seems to trend away about W by S to a remarkable point in the passage which makes in a hummock and which at first we took for an island I believe it to be the same which in the French charts is called Stroomen Point but I gave it the name of HUMMOCK POINT Its latitude according to my account is ° ′ N longitude ° ′ E and it is a good mark for those to know the passage that fall in with the land coming from the eastward who if possible should always make this side of the passage From Hummock Point the land trends more away to the southward about S W by W and to the southward of it there is a deep bay full of islands and rocks which appeared to me to be very dangerous Just off the Point  there are two rocks which though they are above water  cannot be seen from a ship till she is close to the land To the eastward of this Point close to the shore are two islands one of them very flat long and even and the other swelling into a hill both these islands as well as the adjacent country are well covered with trees I stood close in a little to the eastward of them and had no ground with an hundred fathom within half a mile of the shore which seemed to be rocky A little to the westward of these islands we saw no less than sixty boats which were fishing on some shoals that lie between them and Hummock Point This part of the shore appeared to be foul and I think should not be approached without great caution In this place I found the currents various and uncertain sometimes setting to the southward and sometimes to the northward and sometimes there was no current at all the weather also was very unsettled and so was the wind it blew however chiefly to the south and south west quarter but we had sometimes sudden and violent gusts and tornadoes from the N W with thunder lightning and rain these generally lasted about an hour when they were succeeded by a dead calm and the wind would afterwards spring up fresh from the S W or S S W which was right against us and blow strong From these appearances I conjectured that the shifting season had commenced and that the west monsoon would soon set in The ship sailed so ill that we made very little way we frequently founded in this passage but could get no ground  On the st of November  as we were standing towards Borneo we made two small islands which I judged to be the same that in the French chart are called Taba Islands they are very small and covered with trees By my account they lie in latitude ° ′ N longitude ° ′ W of the south end of Mindanao and are distant from Hummock  or Stroomen Point  about fiftyeight leagues The weather was now hazy but happening suddenly to clear up we saw a shoal with breakers at the distance of about five or six miles from the south to the north west Off the north end of this shoal we saw four hummocks close together which we took for small islands and seven more from the S ½ W to the W ½ S whether these are really islands or some hills on the island of Borneo I could not determine This shoal is certainly very dangerous but may be avoided by going to the westward of Taba Islands where the passage is clear and broad In the French chart of Monsieur D'Apres de Mandevillette published in two shoals are laid down to the eastward and a little to the north of these islands one of them is called  Vanloorif  and the other on which are placed two islands  Harigs  but these shoals and islands have certainly no existence as I turned through this part of the passage from side to side and sailed over the very spot where they are supposed to lie In the same chart seven small islands are also laid down within half a degree to the northward of the line and exactly in the middle of the narrowest part of this passage but neither have these islands any existence except upon paper though I believe there may be some small islands close to the main land of Borneo we thought we had seen two which we took to be those that are laid down in the charts off Porto Tubo but of this I am not certain The southermost and narrowest part of this passage is about eighteen or twenty leagues broad with high lands on each side We continued labouring in it till the th  before we crossed the line so that we were a fortnight in sailing eight and twenty leagues the distance from the north entrance of the streight which we made on the  th After we got to the southward of the line we found a slight current setting against us to the northward which  daily increased the weather was still unsettled  with much wet the winds were chiefly S W and W S W and very seldom farther to the northward than W N W except in the tornadoes which grew more frequent and violent and by them we got nothing but hard labour as they obliged us to hand all our sails which indeed with our utmost effort we were scarcely able to do our debility daily increasing by the falling sick of the few that were well or the death of some among the many that were sick Under these circumstances we used our utmost endeavours to get hold of the land on the Borneo side but were not able and continued to struggle with our misfortunes till the d of December  when we fell in with the small islands and shoals called the Little Paternosters the southermost of which according to my account lies in latitude ° ′ S and the northermost in ° ′ S the longitude of the northermost I made ° ′ E they bear about S E ¼ S and N W ¼ N of each other distant eight leagues and between them are the others the number of the whole is eight They lie very near the Celebes side of the streight and being unable either to weather them or get to the westward of them we were obliged to go between them and the island We had here tempestuous weather and contrary winds with sudden and impetuous gusts which as we had not a number of hands sufficient to bend the sails often endangered our masts and yards and did great damage to our sails and rigging especially at this time as we were obliged to carry all the sail we could to prevent our falling into a deep bight on the Celebes shore The ravages of the scurvy were now universal there not being one individual among us that was free and the winds and currents being so hard against us that we could neither get westing nor southing to reach any place of refreshment the mind participated in the sufferings of the body and a universal  despondency was reflected from one countenance to another especially among those who were not able to come upon the deck In this deplorable situation we continued till the th  and it is not perhaps very easy for the most fertile imagination to conceive by what our danger and distress could possibly be increased yet debilitated sick and dying as we were in sight of land that we could not reach and exposed to tempests which we could not resist we had the additional misfortune to be attacked by a pirate that this unexpected mischief might lose none of its force it happened at midnight when the darkness that might almost be felt could not fail to cooperate with whatever tended to produce confusion and terror This sudden attack however rather rouzed than depressed us and though our enemy attempted to board us before we could have the least apprehension that an enemy was near we defeated his purpose he then plied us with what we supposed to be swivelguns and small arms very briskly but though he had the start of us we soon returned his salute with such effect that shortly after he sunk and all the unhappy wretches on board perished It was a small vessel but of what country or how manned it was impossible for us to know The Lieutenant and one of the men were wounded though not dangerously part of our running rigging was cut and we received some other slight damage We knew this pirate to be a vessel which we had seen in the dusk of the evening and we afterwards learnt that she belonged to a freebooter who had more than thirty such vessels under his command The smallness of our vessel encouraged the attack and her strength being so much more than in proportion to her size supposing her a merchantman rendered it fatal  On Saturday the th  we fell in with the dangerous shoals called the  Spera Mondes  and had the mortification to  find that the westerly monsoon was now set in  against which and the current it was impossible for any ship to get as far westward as Batavia As it was now necessary to wait till the return of the eastern monsoon and the shifting of the current as we had buried thirteen of our crew and no less than thirty more were at the point of death as all the petty officers were among the sick and the Lieutenant and myself who did all duties in a feeble condition it was impossible that we should keep the sea and we had no chance of preserving those who were still alive but by getting on shore at some place where rest and refreshment might be procured I therefore determined that I would take advantage of our being so far to the southward and endeavour to reach Macassar the principal settlement of the Dutch upon the island of Celebes  The next day  we made some islands which lie not far from that place and saw what sometimes we took for shoals and sometimes for boats with men on board but what afterwards appeared to be trees and other drift floating about with birds sitting upon them we suddenly found ourselves twenty miles farther to the southward than we expected for the current which had for some time set us to the northward had set us to the southward during the night We now hauled up east and E ½ N intending to have gone to the northward of a shoal which has no name in our East India Pilot but which the Dutch call the Thumb by noon however we found ourselves upon it our water shallowing at once to four fathom with rocky ground We now hauled off to the south west and keeping the boat ahead to sound ran round the west side of the shoal in ten and twelve fathom our water deepening when we hauled off to the west and shallowing when we hauled off east  Our latitude  by observation when we were upon the shoal was ° ′ S and the northermost of the islands called the Three Brothers then bore S E at the distance of five or six leagues This island is in the English Pilot called Don Dinanga but by the Dutch the North Brother  Between the Three Brothers and the main of Celebes there is another island much larger than either of them called the Island of Tonikiky but none of them are inhabited though there are a few huts belonging to fishermen upon them all The passage between the shoal and this island is clear and good with from ten to thirteen fathom and a sandy bottom but the soundings are to be kept on the side of the island in twelve fathom and never under ten it is however very difficult and dangerous for ships to fall in with the land this way without a pilot on board for there are many shoals and rocks under water I ran in by a chart in the English East India Pilot which upon the whole I found a good one though the names of the islands points and bays differ very much from those by which they are now known When we got near to the Celebes shore we had land and sea breezes which obliged us to edge along the coast though our strength was so much reduced that it was with the utmost difficulty we could work the stream anchor  In the evening of Tuesday the th  we anchored at about the distance of four miles from the town of Macassar which according to my account lies in latitude ° ′ or ° ′ S longitude ° ′ E having spent no less than five and thirty weeks in our passage from the Streight of Magellan  I have been the more particular in my description of as much as I saw of this Streight because all the charts both English and French that I consulted are extremely deficient  and erroneous  and because an exact knowlege of it may be of great service to our China trade the ships by which that trade is carried on may pass this way with as little danger as by the common one which lies along the Prassel shoals and when they miss their passage to China in the south east monsoon and lose the season they may be sure of a clear channel here and fair winds at W S W W and round to W N W in November December and the four following months I am also of opinion that it is a better and shorter way to go to the N E and eastward of the Phillipine Islands than to thread the Moluccas or coast New Guinea where there are shoals currents and innumerable other dangers as they were forced to do when the French were cruizing for them in the common passage during the last war  CHAP X  Transactions off Macassar and the Passage thence to Bonthain  THE same night that we came to an anchor  at about eleven o'clock a Dutchman came on board who had been dispatched by the Governor to learn who we were When I made him understand that the ship was an English man of war he seemed to be greatly alarmed no man of war belonging to the King of Great Britain having ever been there before and I could not by any means persuade him to leave the deck and go down into the cabbin we parted however to all appearance good friends  The next morning  at break of day I sent the Lieutenant to the town with a letter to the Governor in which I acquainted him with the reason of my coming thither and requested the liberty of the port to procure refreshments for my ship's company who were in a dying condition and shelter for the vessel against the approaching storms till the return of a sit season for sailing to the westward I ordered that this letter should without good reason to the contrary be delivered into the Governor's own hand but when my officer got to the wharf of the town neither he nor any other person in the boat was suffered to land Upon his refusal to deliver the letter to a messenger the Governor was made acquainted with it and two officers called the shebander and the fiscal were sent down to him who as a reason why he could not deliver the letter to the Governor himself pretended that he was sick and said that they  came by his express order to fetch it  upon this the letter was at length delivered to them and they went away While they were gone the officer and men were kept on board their boat exposed to the burning heat of the sun which was almost vertical at noon and none of the country boats were suffered to come near enough to sell them any refreshment In the mean time our people observed a great hurry and bustle on shore and all the sloops and vessels that were proper for war were fitted out with the utmost expedition we should however I believe have been an overmatch for their whole sea force if all our people had been well In the mean time I intended to have gone and anchored close to the town but now the boat was absent our united strength was not sufficient to weigh the anchor though a small one After waiting five hours in the boat the Lieutenant was told that the Governor had ordered two gentlemen to wait upon me with an answer to my letter Soon after he had returned and made this report the two gentlemen came on board and we afterwards learnt that one of them was an ensign of the garrison named Le Cerf and the other Mr Douglas a writer of the Dutch East India Company they delivered me the Governor's letter but it proved to be written in Dutch a language which not a single person on board could understand the two gentlemen who brought it however both spoke French and one of them interpreted the contents to me in that language▪ The purport of it was "that I should instantly depart from the port without coming any nearer to the town that I should not anchor on any part of the coast or permit any of my people to land in any place that was under his jurisdiction" Before I made any reply to this letter I shewed the gentlemen who brought it the number of my sick at the sight of so many unhappy wretches who were dying of languor  and disease  they seemed to be much affected and I then urged again the pressing necessity I was under of procuring refreshment to which they had been witnesses the cruelty and injustice of refusing to supply me which was not only contrary to treaty as we were in a King's ship but to the laws of Nature as we were human beings they seemed to admit the force of this reasoning but they had a short and final answer ready "that they had absolute and indispensible orders from their masters not to suffer any ship of whatever nation to stay at this port and that these orders they must implicitly obey" To this I replied that persons in our situation had nothing worse to fear than what they suffered and that therefore if they did not immediately allow me the liberty of the port to purchase refreshments and procure shelter I would as soon as the wind would permit in defiance of all their menaces and all their force go and anchor close to the town that if at last I should find myself unable to compel them to comply with requisitions the reasonableness of which could not be controverted I would run the ship aground under their walls and after selling our lives as dearly as we could bring upon them the disgrace of having reduced a friend and ally to so dreadful an extremity At this they seemed to be alarmed as our situation alone was sufficient to convince them that I was in earnest and urged me with great emotion to remain where I was at least till I had heard again from the Governor to this after some altercation I consented upon condition that I heard from the Governor before the seabreeze set in the next day  We passed all the remainder of this day and all the night in a state of anxiety not unmixed with indignation that greatly aggravated our distress and very early the next morning  we had the mortification to see a sloop that  mounted eight carriageguns  and one of the vessels of the country fitted out for war with a great number of soldiers on board come from the town and anchor under each of our bows I immediately sent my boat to speak with them but they would make no reply to any thing that was said About noon the sea breeze set in and not having then heard again from the Governor I got under sail and proceeded towards the town according to my declaration resolving if the vessels that had anchored under our bows should oppose us to repress force with force as far as we were able these two vessels however happily both for us and for them contented themselves with weighing anchor and attending our motions  Very soon after we had got under sail a handsome vessel with a band of musick and several gentlemen on board made up to us and told us that they were sent by the Governor but could not come aboard if we did not drop our anchor again our anchor therefore was immediately dropped and the gentlemen came on board they proved to be Mr Blydenburg the fiscal Mr Voll the shebander an officer called the licence master or master of the port and Mr Douglas the writer who has been mentioned already They expressed some surprize at my having got under sail and asked me what I intended to have done I told them that I intended neither more nor less than to fulfill the declarations I had made the day before that justified by the common rights of mankind which were superior to every other law I would rather than have put again to sea where our destruction either by shipwreck sickness or famine was inevitable have come up to their walls and either have compelled them to furnish the necessaries we wanted or have run the ship on shore since it was better to perish at once in a just contest than to suffer the lingering misery of  anticipating the perdition that we could not avoid  I observed also that no civilized people had ever suffered even the captives of war to perish for want of the necessaries of life much less the subjects of an ally who asked nothing but permission to purchase food with their money They readily allowed the truth of all I had said but seemed to think I had been too hasty I then observed that I had waited the full time of my stipulation and they in return made some excuse for their not having come sooner telling me that as a proof of their having admitted my claim they had brought me such provisions as their country would afford These were immediately taken on board and consisted of two sheep an elk ready killed and a few fowls with some vegetables and fruit This most welcome supply was divided among the people and that most salutary and to us exquisite dainty broth made for the sick Another letter from the Governor was then produced in which to my great disappointment I was again ordered to leave the port and to justify the order it was alleged that to suffer a ship of any nation to stay and trade either at this port or any other part of the island was contrary to the agreement which had been made by the East India Company with the native Kings and Governors of the country who had already expressed some displeasure on our account and for farther particulars I was referred to the gentlemen that brought the letter whom the Governor stiled his commissaries To these gentlemen I immediately observed that no stipulation concerning trade could affect us as we were a King's ship at the same time I produced my commission it not being possible to bring under the article of trade the selling us food and refreshments for our money without the utmost violence to language and common sense After this they made me several propositions which I rejected because my departure  from this place before the return of the season  was included in them all I then recurred to my former declaration and to enforce it shewed them the corpse of a man who had died that morning and whose life would probably have been saved if they had afforded us refreshments when we first came to an anchor upon their coast This put them to a stand but after a short pause they enquired very particularly whether I had been among the spice islands I answered them in the negative and they appeared to be convinced that I spoke truth After this we came to a better understanding and they told me that though they could not without disobedience to the most direct and positive orders of the Company suffer us to remain here yet that I was welcome to go to a little bay not far distant where I should find effectual shelter from the bad monsoon and might erect an hospital for my sick assuring me at the same time that provision and refreshments were more plenty there than at Macassar from whence whatever else I wanted should be sent me and offering me a good pilot to carry me to my station To this I gladly consented upon condition that what they had offered should be confirmed to me by the Governor and Council of Macassar that I might be considered as under the protection of the Dutch nation and that no violence should be offered to my people for all this they engaged their honour on behalf of the Governor and Council promising me the assurance I had required on the next day and requesting that in the mean time I would remain where I was I then enquired why the two vessels which were at anchor under our bows were allotted to that station and they told me for no other reason than to prevent the people of the country from offering us any violence When matters were thus far settled between us I expressed my concern that except a glass of wine I could present them with  nothing better then bad salt meat  and bread full of weavels upon which they very politely desired that I would permit their servants to bring in the victuals which had been dressing in their own vessel I readily consented and a very genteel dinner was soon served up consisting of fish flesh vegetables and fruit It is with the greatest pleasure that I take this opportunity of acknowledging my obligations to these Gentlemen for the politeness and humanity of their behaviour in their private capacity and particularly to Mr Douglas who being qualified by his knowlege of the French language to interpret between us undertook that office with a courtesy and politeness which very much increased the value of the favour After this we parted and at their leaving the ship I saluted them with nine guns  The next morning the Shebander was sent to acquaint me  that the Governor and Council had confirmed the engagement which had been made with me on their behalf Every thing was now settled much to my satisfaction except the procuring money for my bills upon the government of Great Britain which the Shebander said he would solicit At eight o'clock in the evening he came on board again to let me know that there was not any person in the town who had money to remit to Europe and that there was not a dollar in the Company's chest I answered that as I was not permitted to go on shore to negociate my bills myself I hoped they would give me credit offering him bills for any debt I should contract or to pay it at Batavia To this the Shebander replied that the Resident at Bonthain the place to which I was going would receive orders to supply me with whatever I should want and would be glad to take my bills in return as he had money to remit and was himself to go to Europe the next season He told me  A Draught of  BONTHAIN BAY  situated about Leagues to the S E of MACASSAR in the  ISLAND of CELEBES  Lat ° ″ S  o    map  also that he had considerable property in England  being a denison of that country  and said the Shebander he has also money in my hands with which I will purchase such things as you want from Macassar and see that they are sent after you  Having specified what these articles were to be and agreed with him for the quantity and the price we parted  The next day in the afternoon I received a letter  signed by the Governor and Council of Macassar containing the reasons why I was sent to Bonthain and confirming the verbal agreement which subsisted between us  Soon after the Ensign M le Cerf the Secretary of the Council and a pilot came on board to attend us to Bonthain Le Cerf was to command the soldiers who were on board the guardboats and the Secretary as we afterwards discovered was to be a check upon the resident whose name was Swellingrabel This Gentleman's father died Second Governor at the Cape of Good Hope where he married an English lady of the name of Fothergill Mr Swellingrabel the Resident here married the daughter of Cornelius Sinkclaar who had been Governor of Macassar and died about two years ago in England having come hither to see some of his mother's relations  CHAP XI  Transactions at Bonthain while the Vessel was waiting for a Wind to carry her to Batavia with some Account of the Place the Town of Macassar and the adjacent Country  THE next morning at daybreak we sailed  and the day following in the afternoon we anchored in Bonthain road with our two guardboats  which were immediately moored close in to the shore to prevent the country boats from coming near us and our boats from going near them As soon as I arrived at this place I altered our reckoning I had lost about eighteen hours in coming by the west and the Europeans that we found here having come by the east had gained about six so that the difference was just a day  I immediately waited upon the Resident Mr Swellingrabel who spoke English but very imperfectly and having settled with him all matters relating to money and provisions a house was allotted me near the seaside and close to a little pallisadoed fort of eight guns the only one in this place which I converted into an hospital under the direction of the Surgeon to this place I immediately sent all the people who were thought incapable of recovering on board and reserved the rest as a security against accidents As soon as our people were on shore a guard of thirtysix private men two Serjeants and two Corporals all under the command of Ensign  Le Cerf was set over them and none of them were suffered to go more than thirty yards from the hospital nor were any of the country people allowed to come near enough to sell them any thing so that our men got nothing of them but through the hands of the Dutch soldiers who abused their power very shamefully When they saw any of the country people carrying what they thought our invalids would purchase they first took it away and then asked the price what was demanded signified little the soldier gave what he thought proper which was seldom one fourth of the value and if the countryman ventured to express any discontent he gave him immediately an earnest of perfect satisfaction by flourishing his broadsword over his head this was always sufficient to silence complaint and send the sufferer quietly away after which the soldier sold what he had thus acquired for profit of sometimes more than a thousand  per Cent  This behaviour was so cruel to the natives and so injurious to us that I ventured to complain of it to the Resident and the other two Gentlemen Le Cerf and the Secretary The Resident with becoming spirit reprimanded the soldiers but it produced so little effect that I could not help entertaining suspicions that le Cerf connived at these practises and shared the advantages which they produced I suspected him also of selling arrack to my people of which I complained but without redress and I know that his slaves were employed to buy things at the market which his wife afterwards sold to us for more than twice as much as they cost The soldiers were indeed guilty of many other irregularities it was the duty of one of them by rotation to procure the day's provision for the whole guard a service which he constantly performed by going into the country with his musquet and a bag nor was the honest providetor always content with what the bag would contain for one of  them without any ceremony drove down a young buffalo that belonged to some of the country people and his comrades not having wood at hand to dress it when it was killed supplied themselves by pulling down some of the pallisadoes of the fort When this was reported to me I thought it so extraordinary that I went on shore to see the breach and found the poor black people repairing it  On the th  a sloop laden with rice was sent out from this place in order to land her cargo at Macassar but after having attempted it three days she was forced to return The weather was now exceedingly tempestuous and all navigation at an end from east to west till the return of the eastern monsoon On the same day two large sloops that were bound to the eastward anchored here and the next morning also a large ship from Batavia  with troops on board for the Banda Islands but none of the crew of any of these vessels were suffered to speak to any of our people our boats being restrained from going on board them and theirs from coming on board us As this was a mortifying restriction we requested Mr Swellingrabel to buy us some salt meat from the large ship and he was so obliging as to procure us four casks of very good European meat two of pork and two of beef  On the th a fleet of more than an hundred sail of the small country vessels  called Proas anchored here their burden is from twelve to eighteen and twenty ton and they carry from sixteen to twenty men I was told that they carried on a fishery round the Island going out with one monsoon and coming back with the other so as always to keep under the lee of the land the fish was sent to the China market and I observed that all these vessels carried Dutch colours  No event worthy of notice happened till the th of January  and then I learnt by a letter from Macassar that the Dolphin had been at Batavia On the th the Secretary of the Council who had been sent hither with Le Cerf as we supposed to be a check upon the Resident was recalled to Macassar By this time our carpenter having in a great degree recovered his health examined the state of our vessel and to our great regret she appeared to be very leaky our main yard also was found not only to be sprung but to be rotten and unserviceable We got it down and patched it up as well as we could without either iron or a forge so that we hoped it would serve us till we got to Batavia for no wood was to be procured here of which a new one could be made To our leaks very little could be done and we were therefore reduced to an intire dependance upon our pumps  On Friday the th of February Le Cerf  the military officer who commanded the soldiers on shore was recalled as it was said to fit out an expedition for the island of Bally  on the th of March the largest of our guardboats a sloop about fortyfive tons was ordered back to Macassar with part of the soldiers and on the th the Resident  Mr Swellingrabel received a letter from the Governor of that place enquiring when I should sail for Batavia I must confess that I was surprised at the recal of the officer and the guardboat but I was much more surprised at the contents of the Governor's letter because he knew that it was impossible I should sail till May as the eastern monsoon would not sooner set in All matters however remained in the same situation till near the end of the month when some of my people took notice that for a short time past a small canoe had gone round us several times at different hours of the night and had disappeared as soon as those on board perceived  any body stirring in the ship  On the th while these things were the subjects of speculation one of my officers who came from the shore brought me a letter which he said had been delivered to him by a black man it was directed "To the Commander of the English ship at Bonthyn" That the Reader may understand this letter it is necessary to acquaint him that the island of Celebes is divided into several districts which are distinct sovereignties of the native Princes The town of Macassar is in a district called also Macassar or Bony the King of which is in alliance with the Dutch who have been many times repulsed in an attempt to reduce other parts of the island one of which is inhabited by a people called Buggueses and another is called Waggs or Tosora The town of Tosora is fortified with cannon for the natives had been long furnished with firearms from Europe before the Dutch settled themselves at Macassar in the room of the Portuguese  The letter acquainted me that a design had been formed by the Dutch in conjunction with the King of Bony to cut us off that the Dutch however were not to appear in it that the business was to be done by a son of the King of Bony who was besides a gratuity from the Dutch to receive the plunder of the vessel for his reward and who with eight hundred men was then at Bonthain for that purpose that the motive was jealousy of our forming a connection with the Buggueses and other people of the country who were at enmity with the Dutch and their allies and driving them out of the island or at least a suspicion that if we got back to England some project of that kind might be founded upon the intelligence we should give no English man of war as I have already observed having ever been known to have visited the island before  This letter was a new subject of surprise and speculation  It was extremely ill written with respect to the style and manner yet it did not therefore the less deserve notice How far the intelligence which it contained was true or false I was utterly unable to determine it was possible that the writer might be deceived himself it was also possible that he might have some view in wilfully deceiving me the falshood might procure some little reward for the kindness and zeal which it placed to his account or it might give him an importance which would at least be a gratification to his vanity It behoved me however to take the same measures as if I had known it to be true and I must confess that I was not perfectly at ease when I recollected the recal of the Secretary and Le Cerf with the large sloop and part of the soldiers who were said to have been sent hither for no other reason than to guard us against the insults of the country people the assembling an armed force at Macassar as it was said for an expedition to Bally and the little canoe that we had seen rowing round us in the night not to mention the Governor's enquiry by letter when we intended to leave the island However whether either our intelligence or conjectures were true or false we immediately went to work we rigged the ship bent the sails unmoored got springs upon our cables loaded all our guns and barricadoed the deck At night every body slept under arms  and the next day we warped the vessel farther off from the bottom of the bay towards the eastern shore that we might have more room fixed four swivel guns on the forepart of the quarterdeck and took every other measure that appeared to be necessary for our defence  The Resident Mr Swellingrabel was at this time absent twenty miles up the country upon the Company's business but had told me that he should certainly return on the st of  April a day which I now expected with great impatience especially as an old drunken Serjeant was the most respectable person at the fort  In the evening of the st a packet of letters for him arrived here from Macassar which I considered as a good omen and a pledge of his return at the time appointed but I conceived very different sentiments when I learnt that they were sent to him I did not suspect that he was privy to any such design as had been intimated to me by the letter but I could not help doubting whether he was not kept in the country that he might be out of the way when it should be executed In this state of anxiety and suspense I sent a message to the fort desiring that an express might be dispatched to him to acquaint him that I wished to see him immediately upon business of great importance which would admit of no delay Whether my message was forwarded to him or not I cannot tell but having waited till the th of April  without having seen him or received any answer I wrote him a letter requesting to speak with him in the most pressing terms  and the next day he came on board A few minutes convinced me that he was wholly a stranger to any such design as I had been made to apprehend and he was clearly of opinion that no such design had been formed He said indeed that one Tomilaly a counsellor or minister of the King of Bony had lately paid him a visit and had not well accounted for his being in this part of the country and at my request he very readily undertook to make farther enquiries concerning him and his people The Resident and his attendants took notice that the ship was put into a state of defence and that every thing was ready for immediate action and he told us that the people on shore had acquainted him before he came on board with our vigilance and activity and in particular with our having exercised the ship's company at small arms every day I informed  him that we should at all events  continue upon our guard which he seemed to approve and we parted with mutual protestations of friendship and good faith After a few days he sent me word that having made a very strict enquiry whether any other persons belonging to the King of Bony had been at Bonthain he had been credibly informed that one of the Princes of that kingdom had been there in disguise but that of the eight hundred men who were said in my intelligence to be with him he could find no traces so that except they too like the troops of the King of Brentford were an army in disguise I knew that no such people could be in that country  On the th in the morning the Resident sent me word  that M Le Cerf was returned from Macassar with another officer and that they would come on board and dine with me When dinner was over I asked Le Cerf among other conversation while we were taking our wine what was become of his expedition to Bally to which he answered drily that it was laid aside without saying any thing more upon the subject On the d he returned to Macassar by sea and the other officer who was also an ensign remained to take the command of the soldiers that were still left at this place  The season now approached in which navigation to the westward would be again practicable which gave us all great pleasure especially as putrid diseases had begun to make their appearance among us and a putrid fever had carried off one of our people  On the th of May  the Resident gave me a long letter from the Governor of Macassar which was written in Dutch and of which he gave me the best interpretation he was  able  The general purport of it was that he had heard a letter had been sent to me charging him in conjunction with the king of Bony with a design to cut us off that the letter was altogether false exculpating himself with the most solemn protestations and requiring the letter to be delivered up that the writer might be brought to such punishment as he deserved It is scarcely necessary to say that I did not deliver up the letter because the writer would certainly have been punished with equal severity whether it was true or false but I returned the Governor a polite answer in which I justified the measures I had taken without imputing any evil design to him or his allies and indeed there is the greatest reason to believe that there was not sufficient ground for the charge contained in the letter though it is not equally probable that the writer believed it to be false  At daybreak on Sunday the d of May  we sailed from this place of which and of the town of Macassar and the adjacent country I shall say but little there being many accounts of the island of Celebes and its inhabitants already extant The town is built upon a kind of point or neck of land and is watered by a river or two which either run through or very near it It seems to be large and there is water for a ship to come within half cannon shot of the walls the country about it is level and has a most beautiful appearance it abounds with plantations and groves of cocoanut trees with a great number of houses interspersed by which it appears to abound with people At a distance inland the country rises into hills of a great height and becomes rude and mountainous The town lies in latitude ° ′ or ° ′ S and longitude by account ° ′ E of London  Bonthain is a large bay where ships may lie in perfect security during both the monsoons the soundings are good and regular and the bottom soft mud nor is there any danger coming in but a ledge of rocks which are above water and are a good mark for anchoring The highest land in sight here is called Bonthain hill and when a ship is in the offing at the distance of two or three miles from the land she should bring this hill north or N ½ W and then run in with it and anchor We lay right under it at the distance of about a mile from the shore In this bay there are several small towns that which is called Bonthain lies in the north east part of the bay and here is the small pallisadoed fort that has been mentioned already on which there are mounted eight guns that carry a ball of about eight pounds weight it is just sufficient to keep the country people in subjection and is intended for no other purpose it lies on the south side of a small river and there is water for a ship to come close to it The Dutch Resident has the command of the place and of Bullocomba another town which lies about twenty miles farther to the eastward where there is such another fort and a few soldiers who at the proper season are employed in gathering the rice which the people pay as a tax to the Dutch  Wood and water are to be procured here in great plenty we cut our wood near the river under Bonthain hill our water was procured partly from that river and partly from another when from the other our boat went above the fort with the casks that were to be filled where there is a good rolling way but as the river is small and has a bar the boat after it is loaded can come out only at high water There are several other small rivers in the bay from which water may be got upon occasion  We procured plenty of fresh provisions all the while we lay here at a reasonable rate the beef is excellent but it would be difficult to procure enough of it for a squadron Rice may be had in any quantity so may fowls and fruit there are also abundance of wild hogs in the woods which may be purchased at a low price as the natives being Mahometans never eat them Fish may be caught with the seine and the natives at times supplied us with turtle for this like pork is a dainty which they never touch  Celebes is the key of the Molucca or spice islands which whoever is in possession of it must necessarily command most of the ships that are bound to them or to Banda touch here and always go between this island and that of Solayer The bullocks here are the breed that have the bunch on the back besides which the island produces horses buffaloes goats sheep and deer The arrack and sugar that are consumed here are brought from Batavia  The latitude of Bonthain hill is ° ′ S longitude by account ° ′ E The variation of the compass while we were here was ° ′ W The tides are very irregular commonly it is but once high water and once low water in four and twenty hours and there is seldom six feet difference between them  CHAP XII  Passage from Bonthain Bay in the Island of Celebes to Batavia Transactions there and the Voyage round the Cape of Good Hope to England  WHEN we left Bonthain Bay we kept along the shore  at the distance of two or three miles till evening and then anchored for the night in the passage between the two islands of Celebes and Tonikaky in seven fathom and a half with a bottom of soft mud The next morning  we got again under sail and took our departure from Tonikaky which according to my account lies in latitude ° ′ S longitude ° ′ E the variation here was ° W We went to the southward of Tonikaky and stood to the westward About three o'clock in the afternoon we were abreast of the eastermost of the islands which in the Dutch charts are called Tonyn's Islands This island bore from us about N by W at the distance of four miles and the two westermost were in sight These three islands make a kind of right angle triangle with each other the distance between the eastermost and westermost is about eleven miles and their relative bearings are very nearly east and west The distance between the two westermost is nearly the same and they bear to each other S by E and N by W About six o'clock having just sounded and got no ground we suddenly found ourselves upon a shoal with not three fathom and the water being smooth and clear we could see great crags of coral rocks under our bottom we immediately threw all the sails aback and happily got off without  damage  we had just passed over the eastermost edge of it which is as steep as a wall for we had not gone back two cables' length before we were out of soundings again At this time we had the two westermost of the Tonyn Islands in one hearing N by W at the distance of somewhat more than four miles from the nearest This is a very dangerous shoal and is not laid down in any chart that I have seen it seemed to extend itself to the southward and westward all round the two westermost of these three islands for near six miles but about the eastermost island there seemed to be no danger there was also a clear passage between this island and the other two The latitude of the eastermost and westermost of these islands is ° ′S The eastermost is distant thirtyfour miles due west from Tonikaky and the westermost lies ten miles farther  In the afternoon of the th  we found the water much discoloured upon which we sounded and had five and thirty fathom with soft mud soon after we went over the northermost part of a shoal and had no more than ten fathom with soft mud In this place where we found the water shallowest it was very foul it seemed to be still shallower to the southward but to the northward of us it appeared to be clear We had no observation this day by which I could ascertain the latitude but I believe this to be the northermost part of the shoals that lie to the eastward of the island Madura and in the English East India Pilot are called Bralleron's Shoals the same which in the Dutch charts are called Kalcain's Eylandens By my reckoning the part that we went over lies in ° ′ or ° ′ S and ° ′ to the westward of the island Tonikaky or S ° W distance sixtynine leagues At eleven o'clock the same night we saw to the northward of us the southermost of the islands Salombo I make its latitude to be ° ′ S and  its longitude west of Tonikaky ° ′  at the distance of about eightytwo or eightythree leagues It bears from the last shoal N W by W ¾ W at the distance of about fourteen leagues It is to be remarked that hereabout off the island of Madura the winds of the monsoons are commonly a month later in settling than at Celebes The variation here was not more than half a degree west and we found the current which before set to the southward now setting to the N W  In the afternoon of the th  we saw from the masthead the island of Luback and had soundings from thirtyfive to forty fathom with a bottom of bluish clay The latitude of this island is ° ′ S and its longitude ° ′ west of Tonikaky from which it is distant about one hundred and twelve leagues Its distance west from the islands of Salombo is thirtyone leagues we went to the northward of this island and found a current setting to the W N W  In the evening of Sunday the th  we saw the cluster of small islands called CarimonJava The latitude of the eastermost which is also the largest is ° ′ S and its longitude west of Tonikaky ° ′ From this island it is distant about leagues and fortyfive leagues from Luback  On Thursday the d of June  we hauled in and made the land of Java which proved to be that part of the island which makes the eastermost point of the bay of Batavia called Carawawang Point When we first got sight of the land we had gradually decreased our soundings from forty to eight and twenty fathom with a bottom of bluish mud As we steered along the shore for Batavia we decreased them gradually still farther to thirteen fathom the depth in which night coming on we anchored near the two small islands called Leyden and Alkmar in sight of Batavia and  in the afternoon of the next day  we anchored in the Road which is so good that it may well be considered as an harbour We had now great reason to congratulate ourselves upon our situation for during the whole of our passage from Celebes the ship admitted so much water by her leaks that it was all we could do to keep her from sinking with two pumps constantly going  We found here eleven large Dutch ships besides several that were less one Spanish ship a Portuguese snow and several Chinese junks  The next morning we saluted the town with eleven guns and the same number was returned As this was the birthday of his Britannick Majesty our Sovereign we afterwards fired one and twenty guns more on that occasion We found the variation here to be less than half a degree to the westward  In the afternoon I waited upon the Governor and acquainted him with the condition of the ship desiring liberty to repair her defects to which he replied that I must petition the Council  On the th therefore  which was Councilday I addressed a letter to the Governor and Council setting forth more particularly the condition of the ship and after requesting leave to repair her I added that I  hoped  they would allow me the use of such wharfs and storehouses as should be necessary  In the afternoon of the next day the shebander with Mr Garrison a merchant of the place as interpreter and another person came to me After the first compliments the shebander said that he was sent by the Governor and Council for a letter which they had heard I had received when I was at Bonthain acquainting me that a design had been formed to cut off my ship that the author of it who had injured both me and their nation in the person of the  Governor of that place might be punished  I readily acknowledged that I had received such information but said that I had never told any body it was by letter The shebander then asked me if I would take an oath that I had received no such letter as he had been directed to demand to which I answered that I was surprised at the question and desired that if the Council had any such uncommon requisition to make of me it might be in writing and I would give such reply as upon mature consideration I should think proper I then desired to know what answer he had been instructed to give to my letter concerning the refitting of the ship upon which he told me that the Council had taken offence at my having used the word  hope  and not written in the stile of request which had been invariably adopted by all merchants upon the like occason I replied that no offence was intended on my part and that I had used the first words which occurred to me as proper to express my meaning Thus we parted and I heard nothing more of them till the afternoon of the th when the shebander  and the same two gentlemen came to me a second time The shebander said that he was then commissioned from the council to require a writing under my hand signifying that I believed the report of an intention formed at the island of Celebes to cut off my ship was false and malicious saying that he hoped I had a better opinion of the Dutch nation than to suppose them capable of suffering so execrable a fact to be perpetrated under their Government Mr Garrison then read me a certificate which by order of the council had been drawn up for me to sign as whatever was my opinion I did not think it advisable to sign such a certificate especially as it appeared to be made a condition of complying with my request by the delay of an answer during this solicitation I desired the shebander to shew me  his authority for the requisition he had made  he replied that he had no testimony of authority but the notoriety of his being a public officer and the evidence of the gentlemen that were with him confirming his own declaration that he acted in this particular by the express order of Council I then repeated my request that whatever the Council required of me might be given me in writing that the sense of it might be fixed and certain and that I might have time to consider of my reply but he gave me to understand that he could not do this without an order from the Council and I then absolutely refused to sign the paper at the same time desiring an answer to my letter which they not being prepared to give we parted not in very good humour with each other  After this I waited in a fruitless expectation till the th  when the same three gentlemen came to me the third time and said they had been sent to tell me that the Council had protested against my behaviour at Macassar and my having refused to sign the certificate which had been required of me as an insult upon them and an act of injustice to their nation I replied that I was not conscious of having in any instance acted contrary to the treaties subsisting between the two kingdoms unworthy of my character as an officer honoured with a commission of his Britannic Majesty or unsuitable to the trust reposed in me though I did not think I had been used by the Governor of Macassar as the subject of a friend and ally desiring that if they had any thing to allege against me it might be riduced to writing and laid before the King my Master to whom alone I thought myself amenable With this answer they again departed and the next day  having not yet received any answer to my letter I wrote a second directed like the first in which I represented that the ship's leaks were every day increasing  and urged in more pressing terms  my request that she might be repaired and that the use of wharfs and storehouses might be afforded me  On the th the shebander came again to me  and acquainted me that the Council had given orders for the repair of the ship at Onrust and as there was no storehouse empty had appointed one of the Company's vessels to attend me and take in my stores I enquired whether there was not an answer to my letter in writing to which he answered in the negative adding that it was not usual a message by him or some other officer having been always thought sufficient  After this I was supplied for my money with every thing I could desire from the Company's stores without any further difficulty  A pilot was ordered to attend me and on the d  we anchored at Onrust where having cleared the ship and put her stores on board the Company's vessel we found the bowsprit and cap as well as the main yard rotten and altogether unserviceable the sheathing every where eaten off by the worms and the main planks of the ship's bottom so much damaged and decayed that it was absolutely necessary to heave her down before she could be sufficiently repaired to sail for Europe but as other ships were already heaved down and consequently the wharfs at this time preoccupied the carpenters could not begin their work till the th of July  Under the hands of these people the ship continued till Tuesday the th of August  When they came to examine her bottom they found it so bad that they were unanimously of opinion it should be shifted this however I strenuously opposed I knew she was an old ship and I was afraid that  if her bottom was opened it might be found still worse than it was thought  and possibly so bad as that like the Falmouth she might be condemned I therefore desired that a good sheathing only might be put over all but the  bawse  or master carpenter would not consent except I would certify under my hand that what should be done to the ship was not according to his judgment but my own which he said was necessary for his justification if after such repairs only as I thought fit to direct had been made the ship should come short of her port As I thought this a reasonable proposition I readily complied but as I was now become answerable for the fate of the ship I had her carefully examined by my own carpenter and his mate myself and officers always attending The but ends of the planks that joined to the stern were so open that a man's hand might be thrust in between seven chainplates were broken and decayed the iron work in general was in a very bad state several of the knees were loose and some of them were broken  While I remained here two ships belonging to our India Company put into this port and we found among other private ships from India one called the Dudly from Bengal which had proved so leaky that it was impossible to carry her back Application had been made to the Governor and Council for leave to careen her which had been granted but as the wharfs had been kept in continual use she had been put off above four months The Captain not without reason was apprehensive that he might be kept here till the worms had eaten through the bottom of his vessel and knowing that I had received particular civilities from Admiral Houting applied to me to intercede for him which I was very happy to do with such success that a wharf was immediately allotted her M Houting is an old man and  an Admiral in the service of the States with the rank of Commander in Chief of their marine and the ships belonging to the Company in India He received his first maritime knowlege on board an English man of war speaks English and French extremely well and does honour to the service both by his abilities and politeness he was so obliging as to give me a general invitation to his table in consequence of which I was often with him and it is with pleasure that I take this opportunity of making a public acknowledgment of the favours I received from him and hearing this testimony to his public and private merit he was indeed the only officer belonging to the Company from whom I received any civility or with whom I had the least communication for I found them in general a reserved and supercilious set of people The Governor although the servant of a republic takes upon himself more state in some particulars than any sovereign prince in Europe Whenever he goes abroad he is attended by a party of horse guards and two black men go before his coach in the manner of running footmen each having a large cane in his hand with which they not only clear the way but severely chastise all who do not pay the homage that is expected from people of all ranks as well those belonging to the country as strangers Almost every body in this place keeps a carriage which is drawn by two horses and driven by a man upon a box like our chariots but is open in front whoever in such a carriage meets the Governor either in the town or upon the road is expected not only to draw it on one side but to get out of it and make a most respectful obeisance while his Excellency's coach goes by nor must any carriage that follows him drive past on any account but keep behind him however pressing be the necessity for haste A very mortifying homage of the same kind is also exacted by the  members of the Council called Edele Heeren for whoever meets them is obliged to stop his coach and though not to get out to stand up in it and make his reverence these Edele Heeren are preceded by one black man with a stick nor must any person presume to pass their carriage any more than that of the Governor These ceremonies are generally complied with by the Captains of Indiamen and other trading ships but having the honour to bear his Majesty's commission I did not think myself at liberty to pay to a Dutch Governor any homage which is not paid to my own Sovereign it is however constantly required of the King's officers and two or three days after I came hither the landlord of the hotel where I lodged told me he had been ordered by the shebander to let me know that my carriage as well as others must stop if I should meet the Governor or any of the Council but I desired him to acquaint the shebander that I could not consent to perform any such ceremony and upon his intimating somewhat about the black men with sticks I told him that if any insult should be offered me I knew how to defend myself and would take care to be upon my guard at the same time pointing to my pistols which then happened to lie upon the table upon this he went away and about three hours afterwards he returned and told me he had orders from the Governor to acquaint me that I might do as I pleased The hotel at which I resided is licensed by the Governor and Council and all strangers are obliged to take up their abode there except officers in his Majesty's service who are allowed private lodgings which however I did not chuse  At this place I continued between three and four months and during all that time I had the honour to see the Governor but twice the first time was at my arrival when I waited upon him at one of his houses a little way in the country  the next was in town as he was walking before his house there when I addressed him upon a particular occasion Soon after the news of the Prince of Orange's marriage arrived here he gave a public entertainment to which I had the honour of being invited but having heard that Commodore Tinker upon a like occasion finding that he was to be placed below the gentlemen of the Dutch Council had abruptly left the room and was followed by all the Captains of his squadron and being willing to avoid the disagreeable dilemma of either sitting below the Council or following the Commodore's example I applied to the Governor to know the station that would be allotted me before I accepted his invitation and finding that I could not be permitted to take place of the Council I declined it On both these occasions I spoke to his Excellency by an English merchant who acted as an interpreter The first time he had not the civility to offer me the least refreshment nor did he the last time so much as ask me to go into the house  The defects of the ship were at length repaired much to my satisfaction and I thought she might then safely proceed to Europe though the Dutch carpenters were of a different opinion The proper season for sailing was not yet arrived and my worthy friend Admiral Houting represented that if I went to sea before the proper time I should meet with such weather off the Cape of Good Hope as would make me repent it but being very ill myself and the people being sickly I thought it better to run the risk of a few hard gales off the Cape than remain longer in this unhealthy place especially as the west monsoon was setting in during which the mortality here is yet greater than at other times  On Wednesday the th of September  therefore we set sail from Onrust where the ship had been refitted without  returning  as is usual into Batavia Road and as I was not well I sent my Lieutenant to take leave of the Governor on my behalf and offer my service if he had any dispatches for Europe It was happy for me that I was able to procure a supply of English seamen here otherwise I should not at last have been able to bring the ship home for I had now lost no less than four and twenty of the hands I had brought out of Europe and had four and twenty more so ill that seven of them died in our passage to the Cape  On the th  we anchored on the south east side of Prince's Island in the Streight of Sunda and the next morning I sent out the boats for wood and water of water however we could not get a sufficient quantity to complete our stock for there had not yet been rain enough to supply the springs the wet monsoon having but just set in At this time we had the wind so fresh from the south east which made this part of the island a lee shore that I could not get under sail till the th  when it being more moderate we weighed and worked over to the Java shore In the evening we anchored in a bay called by some New Bay and by others Canty Bay which is formed by an island of the same name We had fourteen fathom water with a fine sandy bottom The peak of Prince's Island bore N W the westermost point of New Island S W and the eastermost point of Java that was in sight N E Our distance from the Java shore was about a mile and a quarter and from the wateringplace a mile and an half New Bay is the best place for wooding and watering of any in these parts the water is extremely clear and so good that I made my people stave all that we had taken in at Batavia and Prince's Island and supply it from this place It is procured from a fine strong run on the Java shore which falls down from the land into the sea and by means of a hoase it may be laded into the boats  and the casks filled without putting them on shore  which renders the work very easy and expeditious There is a little reef of rocks within which the boats go and lie in as smooth water and as effectually sheltered from any swell as if they were in a millpond nor does the reef run out so far as to be dangerous to shipping though the contrary is asserted in Herbert's Directory and if a ship when lying there should be driven from her anchors by a wind that blows upon the shore she may with the greatest ease run up the passage between New Island and Java where there is sufficient depth of water for the largest vessel and a harbour in which being landlocked she will find perfect security Wood may be had any where either upon Java or New Island neither of which in this part are inhabited  Having in a few days completed our wood and water we weighed and stood out of the Streight of Sunda with a fine fresh gale at South East which did not leave us till the island of Java was seven hundred leagues behind us  On Monday the d of November  we discovered the coast of Africa at daybreak on the th we made the Table Land of the Cape of Good Hope and the same evening anchored in the bay We found here only a Dutch ship from Europe and a snow belonging to the place which however was in the Company's service for the inhabitants are not permitted to have any shipping  Table Bay is a good harbour in summer but not in winter so that the Dutch will not permit any of their vessels to lie here longer than the th of May which answers to our November After that time all ships go to False Bay which is well sheltered from the north west winds which blow here with great violence  At this place we breathed a pure air had wholesome food and went freely about the country which is extremely pleasant so that I began to think myself already in Europe We found the inhabitants open hospitable and polite there being scarcely a Gentleman in the place either in a public or private station from whom I did not receive some civility and I should very ill deserve the favours they bestowed if I did not particularly mention the First and Second Governor and the Fiscal  The recovery of my people made it necessary to continue here till the th of January  in the evening of this day I set sail and before it was dark cleared the land  On the th  after a fine and pleasant passage we made the island of Saint Helena and set sail again on the morning of the th  At midnight on the th we made the north east part of the Island of Ascension and brought to till daylight when we ran in close to it I sent a boat out to discover the anchoringplace which is called Crosshill Bay while we kept running along the north east and north side of the island till we came to the north west extremity of it and in the afternoon anchored in the bay we sought The way to find this place at once is to bring the largest and most conspicuous hill upon the island to bear S E when the ship is in this position the Bay will be open right in the middle between two other hills the westermost of which is called Crosshill and gives name to the Bay Upon this hill there is a flagstaff which if a ship brings to bear S S E ½ E or S E by E and runs in keeping it so till she is in ten fathom water she will be in the best part of the Bay In our run along the north east side of the island I observed several other small sandy bays in some of which my boat found good anchorage  and saw plenty of turtle  though they are not so convenient as this where we had plenty of turtle too The beach here is a fine white sand the landingplace is at some rocks which lie about the middle of the Bay and may be known by a ladder of ropes which hangs from the top to mount them by In the evening I landed a few men to turn the turtle that should come on shore during the night and in the morning I found that they had thus secured no less than eighteen from four hundred to six hundred weight each and these were as many as we could well stow on the deck As there are no inhabitants upon this island it is a custom for the ships that touch at it to leave a letter in a bottle with their names and destination the date and a few other particulars We complied with this custom  and in the evening of Monday the st of February we weighed anchor and set sail  On Friday the th  we discovered a ship at a considerable distance to leeward in the south west quarter which hoisted French colours she continued in sight all day and the next morning we perceived that she had greatly outsailed us during the night she made a tack however in order to get farther to windward and as it is not usual for ships to turn to windward in these parts it was evident that she had tacked in order to speak with us By noon she was near enough to hail us and to my great surprise made use both of my name and that of the ship enquiring after my health and telling me that after the return of the Dolphin to Europe it was believed we had suffered shipwreck in the Streight of Magellan and that two ships had been sent out in quest of us I asked in my turn who it was that was so well acquainted with me and my ship and with the opinions that had been formed of us in Europe after the return of our  companion  and how this knowlege had been acquired I was answered that the ship which hailed us was in the service of the French East India Company commanded by M Bougainville that she was returning to England from the Isle of France that what was thought of the Swallow in England had been learnt from the French Gazette at the Cape of Good Hope and that we were known to be that vessel by the letter which had been found in the bottle at the Island of Ascension a few days after we had left that place An offer was then made of supplying me with refreshments if I wanted any and I was asked if I had any letters to send to France I returned thanks for the offer of refreshments which however was a mere verbal civility as it was known that I had lately sailed from the places where M Bougainville himself had been supplied but I said that I had received letters for France from some Gentlemen of that country at the Cape and if he would send his boat on board they should be delivered to his messenger Thus was an occasion furnished for what I have reason to believe was the principal object of M Bougainville in speaking with us a boat was immediately sent on board and in her a young officer drest in a waistcoat and trowsers whether he was thus dressed by design I shall not determine but I soon perceived that his rank was much superior to his appearance He came down to me in my cabbin and after the usual compliments had passed I asked him how he came to go home so soon in the season to which he replied that there had been some disagreement between the Governor and inhabitants of the Isle of France and that he had been sent home in haste with dispatches this story was the more plausible as I had heard of the dispute between the Governor and inhabitants of the Isle of France from a French Gentleman who came from thence at the Cape of Good  Hope yet I was not perfectly satisfied for  supposing M Bougainville to have been sent in haste to Europe with dispatches I could not account for his losing the time which it cost him to speak with me I therefore observed to this Gentleman that although he had accounted for his coming before the usual time from the Isle of France he had not accounted for his coming at an unusual time from India which must have been the case To this however he readily replied that they had made only a short trading voyage on the western coast of Sumatra I then enquired what commodities he had brought from thence and he answered cocoanut oil and rattans but said I these are commodities which it is not usual to bring into Europe it is true said he but these commodities we left at the Isle of France the oil for the use of the island and the rattans for ships which were to touch there in their way to China and in exchange we took in another freight for Europe this freight I think he said was pepper and his whole tale being at least possible I asked him no more questions He then told me he had heard at the Cape that I had been with Commodore Byron at Falkland's Islands and said he I was on board the French ship that met you in the Streight of Magellan which must have been true for he mentioned several incidents that it was otherwise highly improbable he should know particularly the storeship's running aground and many of the difficulties that occurred in that part of the Streight which we passed together by this conversation he contrived to introduce several enquiries concerning the western part of the Streight the time it cost me to get through and the difficulties of the navigation but perceiving that I declined giving any account of these particulars he changed his subject He said he had heard that  we lost an officer and some men in an engagement with the Indians  and taking notice that my ship was small and a bad sailer he insinuated that we must have suffered great hardship in so long a voyage but said he it is thought to be safer and pleasanter sailing in the South Sea than any where else As I perceived that he waited for a reply I said that the great ocean called the South Sea extended almost from one pole to the other and therefore although that part of it which lay between the Tropics might justly be called the Pacific on account of the tradewinds that blow there all the year yet without the Tropics on either side the winds were variable and the seas turbulent In all this he readily acquiesced and finding that he could not draw from me any thing to satisfy his curiosity by starting leading subjects of conversation he began to propose his questions in direct terms and desired to know on which side the equator I had crossed the South Seas As I did not think proper to answer this question and wished to prevent others of the same kind I rose up somewhat abruptly and I believe with some marks of displeasure at this he seemed to be a little disconcerted and I believe was about to make an apology for his curiosity but I prevented him by desiring that he would make my compliments to his Captain and in return for his obliging civilities present him with one of the arrows that had wounded my men winch I immediately went into my bedroom to fetch he followed me looking about him with great curiosity as indeed he had done from the time of his first coming on board and having received the arrow he took his leave  After he was gone and we had made sail I went upon the deck where my Lieutenant asked me if my visitor had entertained me with an account of his voyage This led me  to tell him the general purport of our conversation  upon which he assured me that the tale I had heard was a fiction for says he the boat's crew could not keep their secret so well as their officer but after a little conversation told one of our people who was born at Quebec and spoke French that they had been round the globe as well as we This naturally excited a general curiosity and with a very little difficulty we learnt that they had sailed from Europe in company with another ship which wanting some repair had been left at the Isle of France that they had attempted to pass the Streight of Magellan the first summer but not being able had gone back and wintered in the river De la Plata that the summer afterwards they had been more successful and having passed the Streight spent two months at the island of Juan Fernandes My Lieutenant told me also that a boy in the French boat said he had been upon that island two years and that while he was there an English frigate put into the road but did not anchor mentioning the time as well as he could recollect by which it appeared that the frigate he had seen was the Swallow On the boy's being asked how he came to be so long upon the island of Juan Fernandes he said that he had been taken upon the Spanish coast in the West Indies in a smuggling party and sent thither by the Spaniards but that by the French ship in whose boat he came on board us having touched there he had regained his liberty After having received this information from my Lieutenant I could easily account for M Bougainville's having made a tack to speak to me and for the conversation and behaviour of my visitor but I was now more displeased at the questions he had asked me than before for if it was improper for him to communicate an account of his voyage to me it was equally improper for me to communicate an account of my voyage to him and I  thought an artful attempt to draw me into a breach of my obligation to secrecy  while he imposed upon me by a fiction that he might not violate his own was neither liberal nor just As what the boat's crew told my people differs in several particulars from the account printed by M Bougainville I shall not pretend to determine how much of it is true but I was then very sorry that the Lieutenant had not communicated to me the intelligence he received such as it was before my guest left me and I was now very desirous to speak with him again but this was impossible for though the French ship was foul from a long voyage and we had just been cleaned she shot by us as if we had been at anchor notwithstanding we had a fine fresh gale and all our sails set  On the th of March  we made the Western Islands and went between Saint Michael and Tercera in this situation we found the variation ° ′ W and the winds began to blow from the SW The gale as we got farther to the westward  increased and on the th having got to WNW it blew very hard with a great sea we scudded before it with the foresail only the foot rope of which suddenly breaking the sail blew all to pieces before we could get the yard down though it was done instantly This obliged us to bring the ship to but having with all possible expedition bent a new foresail and got the yard up we bore away again this was the last accident that happened to us during the voyage  On the th being in latitude ° ′ N we got foundings  On the th I knew by the depth of water that we were in the Channel but the wind being to the northward  we could not make land till the next day when we saw the Start Point  and on the th to our great joy we anchored at Spithead after a very fine passage and a fair wind all the way from the Gape of Good Hope  A TABLE OF THE VARIATION of the COMPASS As observed on board of the
