 RICHARD PLANTAGENET a  ndary Tale Now first Published  By  M  r  HULL    Ho  DEDICATION  THE following Legend having been read to a small Circle of select Friends one Lady with great Eagerness of Manner asked the Editor to whom he intended to dedicate it He replied with Truth that he had not yet determined "To whom" added she  can you so properly address it as to  Him  whose Image cleaves to us during the Recital  Him  to whom we owe a livelier Idea of RICHARD the  Third  than either Historian or Painter ever gave  Him  whose Judge ment and Powers of Execution keep Pace with the fine Imagination of that  Poet  whom  He delighteth to Honour  These were nearly her exact Words and the Editor pleads them in Excuse for the Liberty he now takes of dedicating this Poem With great Respect and Esteem TO DAVID GARRICK Esq  PREFATORY ADDRESS  THE following Poem fell into the Editor's Hands by a peculiar Means which he is not at present permitted to reveal He hopes the Singularity of the Story and the moral Tendency which so obviously and strongly inculcates THE DUTY OF A PATIENT SUBMISSION TO THE DESTINATIONS OF PROVIDENCE IN ALL VICISSITUDES AND AFFLICTIONS OF LIFE will justify his giving it to the World He judged it too curious to be utterly lost and his Desire to preserve it  induced him to collect and scatter in Notes throughout the Work such curious Particulars as in his Judgment prove the actual Existence of such a Person as RICHARD PLANTAGENET and the chief Event of his Life to have been incontestibly certain  RICHARD PLANTAGENET  A LEGENDARY TALE  I  "THE Work is done the Structure is complete  "Long may this Produce of my humble Toil  "Uninjur'd stand and Echo long repeat  "Round the dear Walls  Benevolence  and MOYLE"  Sir THOMAS MOYLE Possessor of  EastwellPlace  in the County of  Kent  in the Year gave RICHARD PLANTAGENET who for many Years had been his chief Bricklayer a Piece of Ground and Permission to build himself a House thereon The Poem opens just when RICHARD is supposed to have finished this Task  EastwellPlace  hath since been in the Possession of the Earls of  Winchelsea  II  So RICHARD spake as he survey'd  The Dwelling he had rais'd  And in the Fullness of his Heart  His gen'rous Patron prais'd  III  Him MOYLE o'erheard whose wand'ring Step  Chance guided had that Way  The Workman's Mien he ey'd intent  Then earnest thus did say  IV  "My Mind I see misgave me not  "My Doubtings now are clear  "Thou oughtest not in poor Attire  "Have dwelt a Menial here  V  "To Drudgery and servile Toil  "Thou couldst not be decreed  "By Birth and Blood but thereto wrought  "By hard o'erruling Need  VI  "Is it not so That crimson Glow  "That flushes o'er thy Cheek  "And downcast Eye true Answer give  "And thy Tongue need not speak  VII  "Oft have I mark'd thee when unseen  "Thou thought'st thyself by all  "What Time the Workman from his Task  "The Ev'ning Bell did call  VIII  "Hast thou not shunn'd thy untaught Mates  "And to some secret Nook  "With drooping Gait and musing Eye  "Thy lonely Step betook  IX  "There hath not thy Attention dwelt  "Upon the letter'd Page  "Lost as it seem'd to all beside  "Like some sequester'd Sage  X  "And wouldst thou not with eager Haste  "The precious Volume hide  "If sudden some Intruder's Eye  "Thy Musings hath descried  XI  "Oft have I deem'd thou couldst explore  "The Greek and Roman Page  "And oft have yearn'd to view the Theme  "That did thy Hours engage  XII  "But Sorrow greedy grudging coy  "Esteems of mighty Price  "It's treasur'd Cares and to the World  "The scantiest Share denies  XIII  "All as the Miser's heaped Hoards  "To him alone confin'd  "They serve at once to soothe and pain  "The wretched Owner's Mind  XIV  "Me had capricious Fortune doom'd  "Thine equal in Degree  "Long long e're now I had desir'd  "To know thine History  XV  "But who their worldly Honors wear  "With Meekness chaste and due  "Decline to ask lest the Request  "Should bear Commandment's Hue  XVI  "Yet now thy Tongue hath spoke aloud  "Thy grateful Piety  "No longer be thy Story kept  "In painful Secrecy  XVII  "Give me to know thy Dawn of Life  "Unfold with simple Truth  "Not to thy Master but thy Friend  "The Promise of thy Youth  XVIII  "Now late in Life 'tis Time I ween  "To give thy Labours o'er  "Thy wellworn Implements lay by  "And drudge and toil no more  XIX  "Here shalt thou find a quiet Rest  "For all thy Days to come  "And every Comfort that may serve  "T'endear thy humble Home  XX  "Hast thou a Wish a Hope to frame  "Beyond this neat Abode  "Is there a Good a higher Bliss  "By me may be bestow'd  XXI  "Is there within thine aged Breast  " "The smallest aching Void  Give me to know thy Longings all  "And see them all supply'd  XXII  "All I entreat in Lieu is this  "Unfold with simple Truth  "Not to thy Master but thy Friend  "The Promise of thy Youth"  XXIII  So gen'rous MOYLE intent bespake  The longenduring Man  The Time of RICHARD's Service at  EastwellPlace  was near Sixty Years  Who rais'd at length his drooping Head  And sighing thus began  RICHARD PLANTAGENET reciteth his TALE  I  HARD Task to any but thyself to tell  The Story of my Birth and treach'rous Fate  Or paint the Tumults in my Breast that swell  At Recollection of my infant State  II  Oft have I labour'd to forget my Birth  And check'd Remembrance when in cruel Wise  From Time's Abyss she would the Tale draw forth  And place my former self before my Eyes  III  Yet I complain not tho' I feel anew  All as I speak fell Fortune's bitter Spite  Who once set Affluence Grandeur in my View  Then churlish snatch'd them from my cheated Sight  IV  And yet it may beisnay must be best  Whate'er Heav'n's righteous Laws for Man ordain  Weak Man who lets one Sigh invade his Breast  For earthly Grandeur fugitive as vain  V  Perchance Contentment had not been my Mate  If in exalted Life my Feet had trod  Or my Hands borne in transitory State  The Victor's Truncheon or the Ruler's Rod  VI  My Course perchance had been one dazzling Glare  Of splendid Pride and I in vain had sought  The quiet Comforts of this humble Sphere  Rest undisturb'd and Reason's tranquil Thought  VII  But whither roam I O forgive my kind  My honour'd Lord this undesign'd Delay  Forgive while in my newawaken'd Mind  A Thousand vague Ideas fondly play  VIII  Enoughthey're flownand now my Tongue prepares  Thou Source of every Good by me possest  To pour a Tale into thy wond'ring Ears  Full  At the Time of this Relation RICHARD is supposed to be nigh Fourscore Years of Age but he did not become acquainted with his own Story till he was near Twenty probably in his sixteenth or seventeenth Year  threescore Years closelock'd within my Breast  IX  Of those Carewoven longprotracted Years  Some sixteen Summers pass'd obscurely on  A Stranger to the World its Hopes and Fears  My Name Birth Fortunes to myself unknown  X  Plac'd in a rural soft serene Retreat  With a deeplearn'd Divine I held Abode  Who sought by pious Laws and Conduct meet  The Way to Immortality and God  XI  By him instructed I attain'd the sweet  The precious Blessings that from Learning flow  He fann'd in my young Breast the genial Heat  That bids th' expanding Mind with Ardor glow  XII  He taught me with delighted Eye to trace  The comely Beauties of the  Mantuan  Page  Enraptur'd mix with  Tully  's polish'd Grace  Or catch the Flame of  Homer  's martial Rage  XIII  Nor stopt he there Preceptor excellent  Nor deem'd that Wisdom lay in Books alone  But would explain what moral Virtue meant  And bid us make our Neighbour's Woes our own  XIV  Heaven's genuine Pity glist'ning in his Eyes  The Sweets of Charity he would instill  And teach what Blessedness of Comfort lies  In universal Mercy and Goodwill  XV  So taught this pious Man so thought so did  Squaring his Actions to his Tenets true  His Counsel or Relief to none deny'd  A general Good like Heav'n's allchearing Dew  XVI  Thus guided thus inform'd thus Practicedrawn  In guileless Peace my Spring of Life was spent  My Leisurehours I sported o'er the Lawn  Nor knew what restless Care or Sorrow meant  XVII  A courteous Stranger ever and anon  My kind Instructor's due Reward supply'd  But still my Name my Birth alike unknown  Wrapt in the Gloom of Secrecy lay hid  XVIII  One AutumnMorn the Time I well recall  That Stranger drew me from my soft Retreat  And led my Footsteps to a lofty Hall  Where State and Splendor seem'd to hold their Seat  XIX  Thro' a long Range of spacious gilded Rooms  Dubious I pass'd admiring as I went  On the richwoven Labours of the Looms  The sculptur'd Arch or painted Roof intent  XX  My Guide at length withdrew wrapt in Suspense  And Fear I stood yet knew not what I fear'd  When straight to my appall'd astounded Sense  A Man of noble Port and Mien appear'd  XXI  His Form commanded and his Visage aw'd  My Spirit sunk as he advanced nigh  With stately Step along the Floor he trod  Fix'd on my Face his penetrating Eye  XXII  The dancing Plumage o'er his Front wav'd high  Thickstudded Ribs of Gold adorn'd his Vest  In splendid Folds his purple Robe did ply  And royal Emblems glitter'd on his Breast  XXIII  I sought to bend me but my Limbs refus'd  Their wonted Office motionless and chill  Yet somewhat as the Figure I perus'd  A dubious Joy did in my Mind instill  XXIV  While thus I cow'r'd beneath his piercing Eye  He saw and strove to mitigate my Fear  Soft'ning the Frown of harsh Austerity  In his bold Brow which Nature grafted there  XXV  With Speeches kind he cheer'd my sinking Heart  Question'd me much and stroak'd my drooping Head  Yet his whole Mind he seem'd not to impart  His Looks implied more than his Speeches said  XXVI  A broider'd Purse which weighty seem'd with Gold  He gave me then and kindly press'd my Hand  And thus awhile did stay me in his Hold  And on my Face did meditating stand  XXVII  His Soul work'd hugely and his Bosom swell'd  As though some mighty Thing he yearn'd to say  But with indignant Pride the Thought repell'd  He started frown'd and snatch'd himself away  XXVIII  My Guide return'd and reconducted me  Tow'rd the Abode of my Preceptor kind  A Man he seem'd of Carriage mild and free  To whom I thought I might unload my Mind  XXIX  Without Reserve I told him all that pass'd  Striving by mine his Confidence to gain  Then my Enquiries frank before him cast  Hoping some Knowledge of myself t'attain  XXX  I ask'd what wond'rous Cause yet undiscry'd  Urg'd him his Time and Zeal for me t'employ  And why that Man of Dignity and Pride  Had deign'd his Notice to a StrangerBoy  XXXI  Confus'd yet undispleas'd my Guide appear'd  Nought he divulg'd tho' much he seem'd to know  Save this which he with earnest Look aver'd  "No Obligation Youth to me you owe  XXXII  "I do but what my Place and Duty bid  "With me no KindredDrops of Blood you share  "Yet hard to tell your Birth must still be hid  "Enquire no fartherHonour bids forbear"  XXXIII  Thus he reprov'd yet did it with a Look  As tho' he pitied my Sensations keen  Patient I bow'd me to his mild Rebuke  And pledg'd Obedience with submissive Mien  XXXIV  He left me at my Tutor's soft Abode  And parting bless'd me by the  holy Cross  My Heart wax'd sad as he retrac'd the Road  And seem'd to have sustain'd some mighty Loss  XXXV  But soon tumultuous Thoughts began give Way  Lull'd by the Voice of my Preceptor sage  Unquiet Bosoms he could well allay  His Looks could soften and his Words assuage  XXXVI  Unruly Care from him was far remov'd  Grief's wildest Murmurs at his Breath would cease  O in his blameless Life how well he prov'd  The House of Goodness is the House of Peace  XXXVII  Here I again enjoy'd my sweet Repose  And taught my Heart with pious Wisdom fill'd  No more with anxious Throb to seek disclose  What stubborn Fate had doom'd to lie conceal'd  XXXVIII  But long these fond Delusions did not last  Some sterner Pow'r my rising Life controul'd  My visionary Hopes too swiftly past  And left my Prospects dreary dark and cold  XXXIX  When rugged  March  o'errules the growing Year  Have we not seen the Morn with treach'rous Ray  Shine out awhile then instant disappear  And leave to Damp and Gloom the future Day  XL  So dawn'd my Fate and so deceiv'd my Heart  Nor wean'd me from my Hopes but cruel tore  In one unlook'dfor Moment bade me part  From all my Comforts to return no more  XLI  My Guide once more arriv'd tho' as of late  Of soft Deportment he appear'd not now  But wild Impatience flutter'd in his Gait  And Care and Thought seem'd busy on his Brow  XLII  "Rise Youth" he said "and mount this rapid Steed"  I argued not his Bidding strait was done  Proudcrested was the Beast of warlike Breed  Arm'd at all Points with rich Caparison  XLIII  We commun'd notsuch Heat was in our Speed  Scantly would it allow me Pow'r of Thought  Till Eve deeppainted with a burning Red  To  Bosworth  in  Leicestershire  Bosworth Field  our panting Coursers brought  XLIV  Who hath not heard of  Bosworth  's fatal Plain  Where base Advent'rers did in Compact join  'Gainst Chiefs of Prowess high and noble Strain  And low'r'd the Crest of YORK's imperial Line  XLV  Now verging on that memorable Ground  Our Course we stay'dyet we alighted not  Fill'd with Astonishment I gaz'd around  While in my glowing Breast my Heart grew hot  XLVI  Thickstation'd Tents extended wide and far  To th' utmost Stretch of Sight could I behold  And Banners flutt'ring in the whistling Air  And Archers trimly dight and Prancers bold  XLVII  The sinking Sun with richlyburnish'd Glow  Now to his western Chamber made Retire  While pointed Spears quickshifting to and fro  Seem'd all as spiral Flames of hottest Fire  XLVIII  Promiscuous Voices fill'd the floating Gale  The Welkin echoed with the Steed's proud Neigh  The Bands oft turn'd and ey'd the Western Vale  Watching the Closure of departing Day  XLIX  Light vanish'd now apace and Twilight grey  With Speed unusual mantled all the Ground  The Chieftains to their Tents had ta'en their Way  And Centinels thickposted watch'd around  L  As sable Night advanced more and more  The mingled Voices lessen'd by Degrees  Sounding at length as round some craggy Shore  Decreasing Murmurs of the ebbing Seas  LI  Now tow'rd the Tents awhile we journey'd on  With wary Pace then lighted on the Ground  Befriended by the Stars that shimm'ring shone  And Fires that cast a trembling Gleam around  LII  With hasty Foot we press'd the dewy Sod  Fit Answer making to each station'd Guard  When full before us as we onward trod  A martial Form our further Progress barr'd  LIII  He seem'd as tho' he there did list'ning stand  His Face deepmuffled in his folded Cloak  Now threw it wide snatch'd quick my dubious Hand  And to a neighb'ring Tent his Speed betook  LIV  With glowing Crimson the Pavilion shone  Reflected by the lofty Taper's Ray  The polish'd Armour bright and deft to don  Beside the royal Couch in order lay  LV  The Crown imperial glitter'd in mine Eye  With various Gems magnificently grac'd  Nigh which as meant to guard its dignity  A weighty Curtelax unsheath'd was plac'd  LVI  The Chief unbonnetted and drew me nigh  Wrapt in a deepen'd Gloom his Face appear'd  Like the dark Low'rings of the clouded Sky  Ere the bigbursting Tempest's Voice is heard  LVII  Revenge Impatience all that mads the Soul  All that Despair and Frenzy's Flame inspires  Shewn by the Tapers in his Eyes did roll  Hot Meteors they amid the lesser Fires  LVIII  Tho' each dark Line I could not truly scan  Yet thro' the Veil of his distemper'd Mien  Broke forth a Likeness of that lofty Man  Whom whilom at the Palace I had seen  LIX  To quell his Feelings huge he sternly try'd  Strong Combat holding with his fighting Soul  Cresting himself with more than earthly Pride  As tho' from Pow'r supreme he scorn'd Controul  LX  At length in Part subdu'd his troubled Breast  On my impatient Ear these Accents broke  I pale and trembling as th' attentive Priest  Who waits th' Inspirings of his mystic Oak  LXI  Wonder no more why thou art hither brought  The Secret of thy Birth shall now be shewn  With glorious Ardour be thy Bosom fraught  For know thou art imperial RICHARD's  RICHARD the  Third  Son  LXII  Thy Father I who fold thee in my Arms  Thou royal Issue of PLANTAGENET  It may not perhaps be unacceptable to some of our Readers if we subjoin the Etymology of this Name which has been borne by several of our English Kings GEORGE BUCK Esq Compiler of the Life of RICHARD the  Third  in KENNET's History of  England  says it rather should be called PLANTAGENEST being derived from the two Words  Planta Genesta  or  Genista  that is the Plant  Broom  It was first given to FULKE Earl of  Anjou  who lived an hundred Years before the Norman Conquest He having been guilty of some enormous Crimes was enjoined by Way of Penance to go to the Holy Land and submit to a severe Castigation He readily acquiesced dressed himself in lowly Attire and as a Mark of Humility wore a Piece of  Broom  in his Cap of which Virtue this Plant is a Symbol in the Hyeroglypick Language and VIRGIL seems to confirm it by calling it  humilis Genista the humble Broom  This Expiation finished FULKE in Remembrance of it adopted the Title of  Plantagenest  and lived many Years in Honour and Happiness His Descendants accordingly inherited the Name and many successive Nobles of the Line of  Anjou  not only did the same but even distinguished themselves by wearing a Sprig of  Broom  in their Bonnets  Soon as my Pow'r hath quell'd these loud Alarms  Thou shalt be known be honour'd and be great  LXIII  Rise from the Ground and dry thy flowing Tears  To Nature's Dues be other Hours assign'd  Beset with Foes Solicitude and Cares  Far other Thoughts must now possess the Mind  LXIV  Tomorrow  This decisive Battle which terminated the Contentions between the Houses of  Lancaster  and  York  was fought on  Monday August  d This Interview consequently was on the preceding SabbathNight  Boy I combat for my Crown  To shield from Soil my Dignity and Fame  Presumptuous RICHMOND  HENRY  Earl  of  Richmond  afterwards  King  HENRY VII  seeks to win Renown  And on my Ruin raise his upstart Name  LXV  He leads yon shallow renegado Band  Strangers to War and hazardous Emprize  And 'gainst the mighty Chieftains of the Land  Vain and unskill'd a desp'rate Conflict tries  LXVI  Yet since Assurance is not giv'n to Man  Nor can ev'n Kings command th' Event of War  Since peevish Chance can foil the subtlest Plan  Of human Skill and hurl our Schemes in Air  LXVII  Tomorrow's Sun beholds me Conqueror  Or sees me low among the Slaughter'd lie  RICHARD shall never grace a Victor's Car  But glorious win the Field or glorious die  LXVIII  But thou my Son heed and obey my Word  Seek not to mingle in the wild Affray  Far from the winged Shaft and gleaming Sword  Patient await the Issue of the Day  LXIX  North  The Encampment and Action were three Miles distant from the Town of  Bosworth  and the Place obtained the Name of  Bosworth Field  from that memorable Battle CAMDEN in his Account of  Leicestershire  says  The exact Place is frequently more and more discovered by Pieces of Armour Weapons and other warlike Accoutrements digged up and especially a great many ArrowHeads were found there of a long large and big Proportion far greater than any now in Use  of our Camp there stands a rising Mound  Thy Guide awaits to lead thee on the Way  Thence shalt thou rule the Prospect wide around  And view each Chance each Movement of the Fray  LXX  If righteous Fate to me the Conquest yield  Then shall thy noble Birth to all be known  Then boldly seek the Centre of the Field  And 'midst my laurell'd Bands my Son I'll own  LXXI  But if blind Chance that seld' determines right  Rob me at once of Empire and Renown  Be sure thy Father's Eyes are clos'd in Night  Life were Disgrace when Chance had reft my Crown  LXXII  No Means are left thee then but instant Flight  In dark Concealment must thou veil thy Head  On RICHARD's Friends

the glimm'ring Day  My Knights attend to arm me for the Fight  LXXIV  Once more I knelt he clasp'd my lifted Hands  Bless'd me and seem'd to check a struggling Tear  Then led me forth to follow his Commands  O'erwhelm'd with tend'rest Grief Suspense and Fear  LXXV  What Need of more Who knows not the Event  Of that dread Day that  The whole Continuance of this Action is said to have been but two

Wishes wrought  That pious Man snatch'd from this frail Abode  Had found the Blessing he so long had sought  The Way to Immortality and God  LXXVIII  With flowing Eyes I left the sacred Door  And with relying Heart to Heav'n did bend  To God my Supplication did I pour  To God the Mourner's best and surest Friend  LXXIX  That  He  would guide me to some safe Retreat  Where daily Toil my daily Bread might earn  Where pious Peace might soothe Ambition's Heat  And my taught Heart sublimer Ardor learn  LXXX  He heard meAll I ask'd in thee was lent  Thou lib'ral Proxy of my gracious God  Thou paid'st my Industry with rich Content  And giv'st my weary Age this soft Abode  RICHARD PLANTAGENET died in  December  the fourth Year of EDWARD the  Sixth  's Reign aged Consequently he enjoyed his little comfortable Retreat barely four Years  The following is still to be found in the old Register of the Parish of  Eastwell  "RICHARD PLANTAGENET was buryed the d Daye of  December  "  This last Piece of Intelligence was transmitted to the Editor by a very sensible and worthy Clergyman now living who kindly went from  Wye  to  Eastwell  to collect as many Circumstances as he could to confirm the Authenticity of this singular Story To the Transcript of the Register he subjoined as follows  It is observable that in the old Register there is prefixed to the Name of every Person of  noble Blood  such a Mark as this  At the Name of RICHARD PLANTAGENET there is the same Mark and it is the First that is so distinguished only with this Difference that there is a Line run across it thus    There is still remaining in  EastwellPark  the Ruin of a Building which they say was his House and a Well near it which to this Day is called PLANTAGENET's Well  There is also a Tomb in the Wall of  EastwellChurch  under which he is said to be buried but it appears to me of much older Date  The Editor of this Poem holds it incumbent on him to return his most grateful Thanks to the Gentleman who sent him these curious Particulars for the Trouble he took and the Politeness of his Letter the whole of which he should be proud to make publick together with the Name could he presume such a Liberty to be warrantable  The Editor conjectures the Line which is mentioned to run across the Mark of Nobility to be what is stiled in Heraldry  the Bar of Bastardy  LXXXI  The Work is done the Structure is compleat  Long may the Produce of my humble Toil  Uninjur'd stand and Echo long repeat  Round the dear Walls  Benevolence and MOYLE  FINIS
