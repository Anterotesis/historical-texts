Jonq  Only your cousin Tony holding his nocturnal revels  Jonq  Tony So so 'twas here he came when he slipped from me at the Pantheon  Mrs Jonq  Yes here he came indeed and such a ball as he held with the bear and the servants and the mob out of the street I believe  Enter  Lavender  Lav  Madam I'm sorry I'm obliged to complain of a servant but don't blame me ma'am but indeed there's no such thing as living in the house  Mrs Jonq  What is all this  Lav  Why ma'am Mr Diggory 'Squire Lumpkin's man ran into your ladyship's dressingroom and snatched your cold cream off the toilet  Jonq  Ha ha ha

his letter here I wish he was in a house of his own from my soul for in a fortnight I should not know mine from a carrier's inn  MrsJonq  What gives me most singular amazement is that you chuse to be seen in public with him  Jonq  I grant he is not the most eligible companion for a man of fashion but at a masquerade I was safe from censure for every body imagined the uncouthness  of his appearance and rusticity of his manners merely the effect of his imitative genius The company thought his behaviour all assumed put on  pour l' occasion  for he threw off his domino and I'll assure you simple nature got him insinite reputation He gaped at the masks roared most stentoriously discordant with the musick overset the pyramids pocketed the sweetmeats broke the glasses made love to an Arcadian dairy maid tripped up the heels of a harlequin beat a hermit who happened to be a captain in the guards and gave a bishop a black eye  MrsJonq  But his mother's epistle I languish to hear it  Jonq  I ask your pardon here it is  Takes out a letter and reads  Dear Cousin  In the bearer of this I introduce to your care and friendship my dear son Tony I'll assure you cousin Tony with your help will make a bright man as he's already humoursome and comical I shall be in town myself in about a fortnight or three weeks and then I intend taking a house for him in some airy fashionable part somewhere near Duke's Place as I'd have him near the King's Palace No more at present from your loving cousin  DOROTHEA HARDCASTLE  PS Mr Hardcastle's and my love to cousin Emilia I requcst you'll take Tony to Sadler's Wells as I'm sure he'll like operas  A horn sounds without  Mrs Jonq  Bless me what's that  Jonq  Oh that's Tony's summons for his man he says he hates the ringing of bells therefore has invented that polite substitute  Tony calls without  Tony  Hollo Diggory hollo  Jonqu  Oh here he comes  Tony  without  Hollo slap up the bear here  MrsJonq  Heaven defend us sure he won't drive in a bear here  Jonq  No no my dear don't be alarm'd  Tony  without  Come along Bruin  Enter  Tony Lumpkin  Come in I long to introduce Bruin to my relations Cousin Milly will you see the bear ma'am if you please  Mrs Jonq  Bear oh heavens  Runs off  Tony  Cousin Milly's very timbersome sure Bruin is a mighty civil beast why he's as gentle as the goodnatured lion in the Tower that let's the dog lie in his den with him  Jonq  I don't entertain a doubt of his politeness or goodnature but you'll eternally oblige me by sending him down  Tony  Now would it oblige you in downright earnest  Jonq  Beyond measure  Tony  Tim walk Bruin down again bid him first make his honours at the door tho' Come hereonly cousin lookonly look at him Servant sir why he learned among the grown gentlemen at Hattongarden Ah do now let him in and he and I  and you will dance the hay He's muzzled Tim an't he muzzled  Tim  without  Yes Sir  Tony  Oh then there's no danger you see he cou'dn't bite you if he had a mind he can only scratch you a little  Jonq  Gads curse but I'm not dispos'd to be scratch'd this morning  Tony  Oh very well any other time Only say the word and Bruin's the boy for it Slap him down lad  Jonq  I wish the Devil had you and him together Such a fellowMr Lumkin have you a fancy for this house  Tony  Anan  Jonq  I say do you like this house  Tony  Like it for certain I do  Jonq  Then to you and the bear I must absolutely resign it  Tony  I thank you for your kind offer but if you was to give me your house and your pyebalds and your visee vie I would not thank you because them that give all give nothing at all But indeed if you d let me bring in a little queen with me some night or other unknown to cousn Milly you'd make me as happy as a king  Jonq  Oh fie  Tony  Oh fie Baw shake hands Why don'you get drunk sometimes It's mighty pleasant ay and very wholesome once a week Dr Whatd'yecallum  says so in the book that lies in my mama's window what say you to a bout cousin ha  Iong  Excuse me drinking is in my opinion the most savage and barbarous method that ever brutality invented to murder time and intellects  Tony  By jingo then mama is the first timekiller within ten miles of Quagmire Marsh Oh she loves a sup dearly  Jonq  For shame Mr Lumpkin  Tony  Oh take me it's all in the genteel way tho' for my mama always sipp'd her cordial out of a teapot and then before folks it was only a drop of cold tea you know  Jonq  Ha ha ha  Tony  Ay and Cousin Con Miss Nevill that was courting me used to drink like a glassblower all in the sentimental way Over a lovestory book she and my mama wou'd read and sip till it came out of their eyes Sure Cousin Con was in love with me Oh how sweetly she'd kiss me after a chapter of Mildmay and a twist of the teapot  Jonq  Yes yes what I've always found curse me if there's a woman in the world easier had than the dieaway romantic novellist  Tony  How fine I tell lies he swallows them like syllabub  Aside  Jonq  But you gave me the slip last night at the Pantheon why did not you wait for supper  Tony  Why I love my supper as well as any body especially after a day's hunting because then we have something to talk of But the song way for my  money and we had our own gig here at home I never saw the bear so airy  Jonq  But what think you of the splendor of the Pantheon Is'n't it the temple of Elegance an Olympus hall worthy the gods to revel in  Tony  Gods do you call' em I took some of 'em for rascals A fool of a fellow would have it that I was a lady now I am sure I have not a bit of the lady about me except the softness of my voice but the monkey was a macaroni and those beaux I fancy make as much use of a woman as they do of a sword they keep both merely for shew Oh now I talk of that by jingo I saw a power of fine shews yesterday o'top of Ludgatehill  Jonq  Shews  Tony  Ay I believe I've seen all the fine shews now aye Dog and Magog St Paul's and the Tower and the high post near the Bridge that's going to fall upon the neighbours heads and I've seen a hanging and a house on fire and I paid a halspenny to walk over the Thames at Blackfriars and I eat calveshead turtle opposite the Bank and saw Lord Thingumme's fine coach and the Lilliputian Patagonians and the stockbrokers on 'Change the mad folks in Bedlam and the actor folks at the playhouses one of the play men at Whatd'yecallit playhouse was

Diggory you'll never dare to be so superftitious with me before company  Aside  Dig  Well I won't  Tony  You won'tI think you might call me my honour and not waste much of your manners  Dig  If that's

any regular family to board him with enquire among your acquaintance sir  Jonq  Sir I'll do myself the honour to enquire  Tony  Bruin's a lad of few words but he's as civil a fellow as ever stood upon two legs But cousin Jonquil I won't offer you your fifty guineas you gave the painter  Jonq  Say no more you meant well and that palliates the confequence But for Rubens' sake forego your pretensions in future to a taste in pictures  Tony  Well I know the points of a horse and that's made by a better workman  Jonq  Therefore to the knowledge of horses and dogs like a true 'Squire from this moment confine your claim for if a man will in opposition to nature meddle with matters of which he is fo extremely ignorant he must inevitably render himself the object of ridicule and laughter  Tony  Laughter and what's pleasanter than a laugh By jingo a laugh is all I wanted  If I've rais'd some sweet smiles on those lovely fair faces  I am glad I put wigs on their sisters the Graces  I would not offend you for more than I'll mention  To please all my friends was my only intention  THE END  Of T CADELL Bookseller opposite Catherinestreet Strand may be had the following pieces  BONDUCA a
