REGISTER Clerk of ASSIZE Oyer and Terminer In the COURTS LITERARY  c c  FETTERLANE  Oct    PREFACE  As far as this interesting TRIAL has gone it has been conducted with that rigid impartiality which so particularly distinguishes the various Courts of BRITISH JURISPRUDENCEHow it may terminate can be known only to the ruler of these great events indeed from the contrariety of weighty evidence already advanced and the cloud of testimonies yet to be adduced it would be highly indecorous to indulge even a conjecture upon the probability of its decision  The COURT have wisely resolved to sit without further adjournment in order now to receive at their Bar the evidence of the first POLITICAL and LITERARY Characters against whom exceptions were so ingeniously taken by Council but which however have all been most constitutionally overruled These  being gone through the sage and learned POLONIUS in person will sum up the whole evidence and after delivering a solemn and eloquent charge from the Bench receive from the GRAND INQUEST that VERDICT which no doubt will soon tend to the complete administration of LITERARY JUSTICE by setting this GREAT QUESTION at rest for ever  VORTIGERN AND ROWENA A  COMITRAGEDY  PENDING the distinguished inquest under which the fact is now trying whether the newly discovered DRAMA is or is not from the pen of SHAKSPEARE it would be highly indecorous to hazard a single conjecture upon itThe EDITOR therefore will content himself with merely giving a faithful transcript of all that has been successively recorded on this important subject in that fashionable Intelligencer the MORNING HERALD only remarking that whatever may be the final issue of the TRIAL the passages selected from the Piece itself by the several  VOTERS  pro  and  con  must remain indelible proofs of the discriminative taste of those who have here so characteristically enrolled themselves in defence of our BELLES LETTRES  The following is the paragraphical CHAIN by which this great Literary Concern has been brought into such general notice viz  PARAGRAPH  The SHAKSPEARE  discoveries  said to be made by the son of Mr IRELAND of Norfolkstreet are the Tragedy of LEAR and another entitled VORTIGERN and ROWENA now first brought to light and both in the Bard's own handwritingin the same chest are said to have been also found an antique MELANGE of  love lettersprofessions of faithbillet douxlocks of hairand family receipts  The only danger respecting  faith in the discovery  seems to be from the indiscretion of  finding too much  If poor CHATTERTON had contented himself with drawing literary treasure in  moderation  from the monkish chest of ROWLEY his own  inventive genius  had probably remained unknown  ANOTHER  Mr IRELAND's Tragedy of VORTIGERN whether sterling or fictitious is to go to  Drurylane  Mr SHERIDAN says  "it is the finest play that SHAKSPEARE ever wrote  not that he has had leisure yet to read itbut he had it from an authority as classical and unquestionably as his own judgment viz the solemn assurance of the great Lord SALISBURY himself a  Critic  only six removes by lineal descent from Mr SHERIDAN's own immortal BURLEIGH  FOR THE MORNING HERALD  Mr EDITOR  Your SHAKSPEARE correspondents know but little of what is going forward in the  mine of discovery  Lord Sir if they wish to get at the  whole truth  they must dip  deep  into the  old chest  as the ancients did into the  Pierean  wellindeed they are not correct even in what they have stated For instancethe  precious  LOCK OF HAIR how comes it they were so ignorant as not to know that Mr  Justice  COLLICK the first  Hair Merchant  in the universe has critically inspected it and regardless of the  sacred head  of  fiction  from whence it was shorn he as a  man of business  could only be brought to say that if the whole  string  were as good as the  sample  it was worth no more in the  trade  than s d an ounceThe pointed distich on the envelope however as his Grace of LEEDS declares is worth a millionHere it is  "Ere Age with twinge your nerves doth shocke  "Catch Love like Time by the forelocke"  By which our annotators will no doubt tell us that the  Warwickshire  WAG quaintly inculcates the youthful libertinism of  catch as catch can  Among the more recent treasures are a motheaten  under  PETTICOAT an undoubted  original  Mr MALONE who with all his ability knows but little about  petticoats  says this could be no part of the paraphernalia of the immortal Bardbut Mrs PIOZZI and the whole  Blue Stocking Club  are decidedly of a contrary opinion and that for the best of all feminine reasons viz because Miss HATHAWAY when she became Mrs SHAKSPEARE never failed to  wear  the BREECHESwe have also Mr  Boswell's  authority for this amongst other  domestica facta  of the Poet The next curiosity for the  amateurs  is a  love  VALENTINE surrounded according to antient usage with  hearts cupids doves  and  darts  and in the centre a  typifying  figure of a  cock  without a  combe  according to antique spelling with this inexplicable  anagram  "If to my armes you'll fondlye roame  "Despighte of  Dadde  I'll cut your  Combe  "  W S  From this some of the inspecting  Literati  are cruel enough to infer that SHAKSPEARE must have had an  intriguc  with the daughter of his ancient enemy  John a  COOMBEthe undoubted ancestor of the present  Opposition  ALDERMAN who has the honour of bearing that distinguished name  The last MORCEAU I shall treat you with at this time is selected from the RECEIPTS viz  "A RECIPEE  howe to make a  GOODLIE PLUMBE PUDINGE"  Even Mr STEEVENS admits the unquestionable authenticity of this valuable addendum to the  cullnary art  by declaring that Shakspeare could not endure the  stones  of plumbs which from setting his  teeth on edge  were called  jar  raisins and literally gives an appropriate citation of the following passage from the Poet's  own words  which will certainly be received as the best  glossary  to his  own plumb pudding  "SYLVUSPut  dates  enough into the bag but dearest chuck I prithee make me  geldings  of the PLUMBES"  You shall have further documents equally important and authentic in a few days from Mr Editor  Your's A Modern ANTIQUARIAN  PARAGRAPH  We have it from high authority that the merits of the great question respecting the originality of the  newly  discovered PLAY are put into a train of investigation before a LITERARY COURT of ENQUIRY which cannot fail of the most candid and judicious decisionIt will be managed under the auspices of an illustrious personage who fortunately unites in his  singular  character all the critical and judicial talents requisite for so solemn a disquisition  March    TO CORRESPONDENTS  {inverted ‚ÅÇ} The PROCESSION on opening the LITERARY COURT to try the important QUESTION whether VORTIGERN and ROWENA is or is not from the PEN of SHAKSPEARE is intended for tomorrow's HERALD  PARAGRAPH  March    VORTIGERN AND ROWENA  IT is with much concern we announce that the PROCESSION preparatory to opening the Literary Court of Inquest to try whether this DRAMA is or is not written by SHAKSPEARE was obliged to be suspended till Wednesday by an unpleasant accident  Signor  DELPINI that man of  mighty mouth  who was to have walked as  Champion  to a PRODIGIOUS COURTIER unfortunately dislocated his  jaw bone  in practising an  Aristocratic Grin  in compliment to his illustrious PatronHowever the  Sieur  FOLLET almost equally great in the happy distortions of the human countenance has kindly undertaken this interesting part and to be ready in it that day at noon when this introductory spectacle will certainly take place and our readers be no longer kept in a state of anxious expectancy  March    FOR THE MORNING HERALD  VORTIGERN AND ROWENA  A COMITRAGEDY  Yesterday morning at eleven o'clock the several Officers and other great Personages assembled at the HUM MUMS in Covent Garden and from thence marched to the LITERARY COURT in Norfolkstreet in the following STATE PROCESSION viz  Four MUTES With their fore fingers placed on their lips  A  Bronze  of Signor DELPINI  In his happiest stile of face  THE LOCK OF HAIR  Of Miss HATHAWAY afterwards the happy  MRS SHAKSPEARE  Borne by Mr Justice COLLICK  Hair  Merchant  His train supported by an  Unlicensed  HAIRDRESSER dishevelled and without powder preceded by a Banner dedicated  To WIGGISM  The Chief COOK of the Crown and Anchor Tavern with cheeks  a la blaze  carryingon a  trencher  The Book of FAMILY RECEIPTS Six TRUNK MAKERS two and two  The Antique TRUNK  Covered with ASSSKIN still perfect but surcharged with  moth black beetles  and  cobwebs  the flappets of the covering supported by the six Senior ANNOTATORS on the Immortal BARD and their train upheld by an equal number of FARCE WritersA Banner following inscribed  Sacred  to FICTION  The PROMPTER of DRURYLANE  gagged  The Dramatic FAITH of Mr SHERIDAN  Delicately concealed in a  Snowdrop  And borne by Mr KEMBLE riding on an ELEPHANT  Over whom waved a Streamer displaying the word MANAGEMENT  A Groupe of SPIRITS  blue red black  and  grey  A Waxen Semblance of  The Mighty BURLEIGH  His Banner advanced before displaying  Three DRIED NEATS TONGUES  The Family Arms with their Motto  "ELOQUENCE"  The DANISH CHAMBERLAIN POLONIUS  With his  White Wand  of Office and his Train supported by  Three OPERA EUNUCHS  The  Sieur  FOLLET  In the Armour of HAMLET's GHOST bearing the  Club of HERCULES as his CHAMPION  An  Embossed  MONEYBAG  With "LICENCES at any PRICE"  Inscribed in Golden Characters  Six FIDLERS with broken bows  Six FEMALE SINGERS weeping  BANNER"Sacred to HARMONY"  Sir FRETFUL  Carried in torture on his own WHEEL  The

NOAH's ARK  SCENT  ERS c c c  The august procession entered the COURT about one when the Commission was opened in due form the interesting particulars of which we hope to record on Friday next  FIRST DAY's TRIAL  VORTIGERN AND ROWENA A COMITRAGEDY  AS soon as the Court was opened with all due formalities the DANISH CHAMBERLAIN Lord POLONIUS arose and gracefully made an obeisance to  himself  in a spacious Mirror which was instantly returned by a figure of similar dignity from this STATE REFLECTOR dexterously placed in the front of the CHAIR that his Lordship might have the judicial advantage of seeing what he  himself  was about which no other person in the Court could ever know or possibly divineThe  Sieur  FOLLET as Chamberlain's  Grand  CHAMPION then gigantically advanced and after throwing down his gauge and thrice brandishing his  Herculean Club  affixed a written PROCLAMATION to its butt when placing the smaller end on the bridge of his nose the following preliminary CHALLENGE became visible to all around  viz  "If any one present dare gainsay that the Lord POLONIUS is the most  witty  most  wise  most  valorous  most  eloquent  most  disinterested  most  beloved  most  puissant  most  chaste  let him come forth and I the unworthy  Champion  of that mighty Lord will tell him that he lyes in his teeth and from my furious wrath the Lord deliver his miserable carcase"  Here an enraged  Musician  indignantly advanced with an intent as was supposed to take up the glove but was prevented in being humanely knocked down by one of the  Beefcaters  A nod mandatory was now given from the Chair as a cue to the principal  Harlequin  who waving his dagger of lath over a richly inlaid tablet a pair of folding doors of ophir flew open and discovered an irradiating glory of aethereal blue and gold darting its  transcendent beams on the  Title Page  of an antique volume in quarto curiously filligreed and fretted with  moths  and  earwigs  and entitled  VORTIGERN AND ROWENA  On Harlequin waving his lath a second time a light coloured cloud gently descended to a soft strain of Aeolian measure which opening displayed a scrowl with this Inscription  Ye of the School of  Nature  as of  Art  draw near  "And faithful verdict give  "Between the sacred memory  "Of your Immortal BARD  "And his Accusers by whom he now stands Charged  "As the Villifier of his own fair fame  "In penning the COMITRAGEDY now before you  "Peruse therefore this  Dramatic  RECORD  "And your several judgments pronounced thereon  "By selecting severally a Passage from the same  "Which shall be enregistered  "In affirmation or negation of that  "LITERARY FACT which the majority  "Of your suffrages must finally decide  "APPROACH"  The instantaneous pressing forward of the  Literati Cognoscenti Diletanti  c c of both sexes to inspect the Record was so great and violent that it reached even the Chair of State like an electric shock when  Polonius  rising up in dignified dismay signified to his officers by the pale vibration of his nostrils that it was his mighty pleasure the Court should be adjourned This was effected by the talismatic sword of Harlequin as soon as possible but not till a few  pushing  characters of the  Literary Jurors  had fixed on the following passages and enregistered their votes thereon viz  PASSAGES SELECTED AS SUFFRAGES ON THE FIRST DAY's TRIAL  viz  ILady CH CBLL  "LOOKE what a shape  "Limbes fondlie fashioned in the wanton moulde  "Of NatureWarm in Love's slie wytcheries  "And scorninge all the draperie of Arte  "A spider's

the  Grand Literary  COURT on Saturday  order  was happily restored by an emanation of that  official wisdom  with which the LORD POLONIUS is so peculiarly gifted A  golden padlock  it seems had been most delicately affixed that morning to the antique clasps of the COMITRAGEDY This at first naturally excited a little surprize but it was soon dispelled by the very graceful delivery of the following  State Paper  from the courtly hand of Mr  Kiddy  DAVIS of the Theatre Royal Covent Garden whom the Manager has kindly lent as SAXON REPRESENTATIVE in  waiting  of the heroic VORTIGERN  COPY  BY AUTHORITY  It is ORDERED that no person of what  rank quality  or  degree  soever shall presume to take any  part share  or  interest  in or give any  public opinion  on the sacred DRAMA of  Vortigern and Rowena  until such person  shall have been first duly invested with a  Two Guinea  stamped LICENCE under our hand and seal on pain and peril of being prosecuted with the utmost rigour as a  Vagabond  under the wholesome statute entitled "The  Vag  ant  ACT" "so wisely instituted for the correction of such  State  abuses  Signed POLONIUS  Counter signed FOLLET G C  This was allowed by all the  knowing ones  present to be a  thou ht  of the most  profound polity  and equal to any thing recorded of the sagacious  House of  BURLEIGH It naturally branched itself into a twofold good viz as a touchstone of  insurance  as to the  qualification  and  ability  of votersdlywhich his Lordship's  liberality  must mark as the principal considerationit instantly made the  Literary Inquest  more  select  tended to exped  e the proceedings of the Court and thus pa  tically expose the endless duration of  Hastings' Impeachment Licences  were accordingly taken out by those who were prepared for this  voluntary  LEVY and those who were not were very decorously kicked out of Court  Another decree of a subordinate kind likewise passed viz to change the  suffrage  annexed to the chosen Passages from GUILTY and  Not  GUILTY to "GENUINE" and "  Not  GENUINE"the vulgar repetition of the sound of  guilt  c being sometimes observed to raise a  demiblush  of confusion on the OFFICIAL cheekThe solemn business of the day then commenced  The following is the List of  Licenced  VOTERS and their selected  Passages  enregistered at this Sitting which we are promised in time for tomorrow's publication viz  Marg ANSH  Earl HWE  Hon Mrs STNPE  Mrs FIIZT  Lord CHR  Marquis TOWD  The CLERK in COURT has directed us to make an  Frratum  in our first day's report on the  Passage  which Mr BFY

Write  "washed his  fair  in the Tagus  "To admire it in its glasse c"  This emendation is unquestionably due to common  decency  as well as common sense The word  facre  as a Saxon derivative unfortunately signifies  sallow  it cannot therefore be supposed by those in any habits with the worthy Member for  Yarmouth  that a Gentleman naturally conscious of so  fair a face  himself could have selected a passage thus personally repugnant to his own taste and feelings  VIMargne of ANPCH  "Oh she would enacte you from earliest youthe scenes to bewitche men's eyes and eares and hartesOf
