 The LATE TRYAL AND CONVICTION OF Count  TARIFF  LONDON  Printed for  A Baldwin  near the  OxfordArms  in  WarwickLane  MDCCXIII Price Three pence  THE LATE  Tryal  and  Conviction  OF Count  TARIFF  THE whole Nation is at present very inquisitive after the Proceedings in the Cause of Goodman  Fact  Plaintiff and Count  Tariff  Defendant as it was Tried on the th of  June  in the Thirteenth Year of Her Majesty's Reign and in the Year of the Lord I  shall therefore give my Countrymen a short and faithful Account of that whole Matter And in order to it must in the first Place premise some Particulars relating to the Person and Character of the said Plaintiff Goodman  Fact  Goodman  Fact  is allowed by every Body to be a plainspoken Person and a Man of very few Words Tropes and Figures are his Aversion He affirms every Thing roundly without any Art Rhetorick or Circumlocution He is a declared Enemy to all Kinds of Ceremony and Complaisance He flatters no Body Yet so great is his natural Eloquence that he cuts down the finest Orator and destroys the bestcontrived Argument as soon as ever he gets himself to be heard He never applies to the Passions or Prejudices of his Audience When they listen with Attention  and honest Minds he never fails of carrying his Point He appear'd in a Suit of  English  BroadCloath very Plain but Rich Every thing he wore was substantial honest homespun Ware His Cane indeed came from the  EastIndies  and two or three little Superfluities from  Turkey  and other Parts It is said that he encouraged himself with a Bottle of Neat  Port  before he appear'd at the Tryal He was Huzza'd into the Court by several Thousands of  Weavers Clothiers Fullers Dyers Packers Calenders Setters Silkmen Spinners Dressers Whitsters Winders Mercers Throwsters SugarBakers Distillers Drapers Hosiers Planters Merchants  and  Fishermen  who all unanimously declared that they cou'd not live above Two Months longer if their Friend  Fact  did not gain his Cause  Every Body was overjoy'd to hear that the Good Man was come to Town He no sooner made his Appearance in Court but several of his Friends fell a weeping at the Sight of him For indeed he had not been seen there some Years before  The Charge he exhibited against Count  Tariff  was drawn up in the following Articles  That the said Count had given in false and fraudulent Reports in the Name of the Plaintiff  That the said Count had tamper'd with the said Plaintiff and made Use of many indirect Methods to bring him over to his Party  That the said Count had wilfully and knowingly traduced the said Plaintiff having misrepresented him in many cunninglydevised Speeches as a Person in the  French  Interest  That the said Count had averred in the Presence of above Five hundred Persons that he had heard the Plaintiff speak in Derogation of the  Portuguese Spaniards Italians Hollanders  and others who were the Persons whom the said Plaintiff had always favoured in his Discourse and whom he should always continue to Favour  That the said Count had given a very disadvantageous Relation of Three Great Farms which had long flourished under the Care and Superintendency of the Plaintiff  That he would have obliged the Owners of the said Farms to buy up many Commodities which grew upon their own Lands That he would have taken away the Labour from the Tenants and put it into the Hands of Strangers That he wou'd have lessen'd and destroy'd the Produce of the said Farms  That by these and many other wicked Devices he wou'd have starved many honest DayLabourers have impoverish'd the Owner and have fill'd his Farms with Beggars c  That the said Count had either Sunk or Mislaid several Books Papers and Receipts by which the Plaintiff might sooner have found Means to vindicate himself from  such Calumnies Aspersions and Misrepresentations  In all these Particulars Goodman  Fact  was very Short but Pithy For as I said before he was a plain homespun Man His Yea was Yea and his Nay Nay He had further so much of the Quaker in him that he never swore but his Affirmation was as Valid as another's Oath  It was observed that Count  Tariff  endeavour'd to browbeat the Plaintiff all the while he was speaking But though he was not so Impudent as the Count he was every whit as Sturdy and when it came to the Count's Turn to speak Old  Fact  so stared him in the Face after his plain downright Way that the Count was very often struck Dumb  and forced to hold his Tongue in the middle of his Discourse  More Witnesses appeared on this Occasion to attest Goodman  Fact  's Veracity than ever were seen in a Court of Justice His Cause was pleaded by the Ablest Men in the Kingdom among whom was a Gentleman of  Suffolk  who did him Signal Service  Count  Tariff  appeared just the Reverse of Goodman  Fact  He was dress'd in a Fine Brocade Wastcoat curiously Embroider'd with FlowerdeLuces He wore also a broadbrimm'd Hat a ShoulderKnot and a Pair of Silverclock'd Stockins His Speeches were accompanied with much Gesture and Grimace He abounded in empty Phrases superficial Flourishes  violent Assertions and feeble Proofs To be brief he had all the  French  Assurance Cunning and Volubility of Tongue and wou'd most certainly have carried his Cause had he dealt with any one Antagonist in the World besides Goodman  Fact  The Count being call'd upon to Answer to the Charge which had been made against him did it after a Manner peculiar to the Family of the  Tariffs  viz by Railing and calling Names  He in the First Place accused his Adversary of  Scandalum magnatum  and of speaking against his Superiors with Sauciness and Contempt As the Plain Good Man was not of a Make to have any Friends at Court he was a little startled at this Accusation till at length he made it appear  that it was impossible for any of his Family to be either Saucy or Cringing for that their Character was above all others in the World to do what was required of them by the Court that is TO SPEAK THE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH  The Count in the next Place assured the Court that his Antagonist has taken upon him a wrong Name having curtail'd it of Two or Three Letters for that in Reality his Name was not FACT but FACTION The Count was so pleased with this Conceit that for an Hour together he repeated it in every Sentence calling his Antagonist's Assertions the Reports of Faction his Friends the Sons of Faction the Testimonies of his Witnesses the Dictates of Faction Nay with such a Degree of Impudence did he push this Matter that  when he heard the Cries of above a Million of People begging for their Bread He termed the Prayers and Importunities of such a starving Multitude the CLAMOURS OF FACTION  As soon as the Count was driven out of this Device he affirmed roundly in the Court that FACT was not an  Englishman  by Birth but that he was of  Dutch  Extraction and born in  Holland  In consequence of this Assertion he began to rally the poor Plaintiff under the Title of MYN HEER VAN FACT which took pretty well with the Simpletons of his Party but the Men of Sense did not think the Jest worth all their Lands and Tenements  When the Count had finished his Speech he desired leave to call in his Witnesses which was granted When  immediately there came to the Bar a Man with a Hat drawn over his Eyes in such a manner that it was impossible to see his Face He spoke in the Spirit nay in the very Language of the Count repeated his Arguments and confirmed his Assertions Being ask'd his Name He said the World called him MERCATOR But as for his true Name his Age his Lineage his Religion his Place of Abode they were Particulars which for certain Reasons he was obliged to conceal The Court found him such a False Shuffling Prevaricating Rascal that they set him aside as a Person unqualify'd to give his Testimony in a Court of Justice advising him at the same time as he tender'd his Ears to forbear uttering such notorious Falshoods as he had then Published The Witness however persisted in his Contumacy telling them he was very sorry to  find that notwithstanding what he had said they were resolved to be as arrant Fools as all their Forefathers had been for a Hundred Years before them  There came up another Witness who spoke much to the Reputation of Count  Tariff  This was a Tall Black Blustering Person dressed in a  Spanish  Habit with a Plume of Feathers on his Head a  Golillio  about his Neck and a long  Toledo  sticking out by his Side His Garments were so cover'd with Tinsel and Spangles that at a distance he seem'd to be made up of Silver and Gold He call'd himself DON ASSIENTO and mentioned several Nations that had sought his Friendship but declared that he had been gained over by the Count and that he was come into these Parts  to enrich every one that heard him The Court was at first very well pleased with his Figure and the Promises he made them but upon Examination found him a True  Spaniard  Nothing but Show and Beggary For it was fully proved that notwithstanding the Boasts and Appearance which he made he was not worth a Groat Nay that upon casting up his Annual Expences with the Debts and Incumbrances which lay upon his Estate he was worse than Nothing  There appear'd another Witness in favour of the Count who spoke with so much Violence and Warmth that the Court begun to listen to him very attentively till upon hearing his Name they found he was a notorious Knight of the Post being kept in Pay to give his Testimony on all  Occasions where it was wanted This was the EXAMINER A Person who had abused almost every Man in  England  that deserved well of his Country He called Goodman  Fact  a Lyar a Seditious Person a Traytor and a Rebel and indeed so much incens'd the Honest Man that he would certainly have knock'd him down if he could have come at him It was allowed by every Body that so foulmouth'd a Witness never appeared in any Cause Seeing several Persons of great Eminence who had maintained the Cause of Goodman  Fact  he called them Ideots Blockheads Villains Knaves Infidels Atheists Apostates Fiends and Devils Never did Man show so much Eloquence in Ribaldry The Court was at length so justly provok'd with this Fellow's Behaviour who spared no Age nor Sex nor Profession which had shown any Friendship or  Inclination for the Plaintiff that several began to Whisper to one another it was high time to bring him to Punishment But the Witness overhearing the Word  Pillory  repeated twice or thrice slunk away privately and hid himself among the People  After a full Hearing on both Sides Count  Tariff  was Cast and Goodman  Fact  got his Cause but the Court sitting late did not think it fit at that time to give him Costs or indeed to enter into that Matter The Honest Man immediately retired after having assured his Friends That at any time when the Count shou'd appear on the like Occasion he would undertake their Defence and come to their Assistance if they would be at the Pains to find him out  It is incredible how general a Joy Goodman  Fact  's Success created in the City of  London  there was nothing to be seen or heard the next Day but shaking of Hands Congratulations Reflections on the Danger they had escap'd and Gratitude to those who had delivered them from it  The Night concluded with Balls Bonfires Ringing of Bells and the like Publick Demonstrations of Joy  FINIS
