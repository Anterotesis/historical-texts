 The Hermit  A POEM  Now taught by this confess th' Almighty just  And where thou can't unravel learn to trust  FAR in a Wild remote from publick view  From Youth to Age a rev'rend Hermit grew  The Moss his Bed the Cave his humble Cell  His Food the Fruits his Drink the Chrystal Well  Unknown to Man with God he pass'd the Days  Pray'r all his Bus'ness all his Pleasure Praise  A life so sacred such serene Repose  Seem'd Heaven itself till one Suggestion rose  That Vice should triumph Virtue Vice obey  Hence sprung some Doubts of Providence's Sway  His Hopes no more a certain Prospect boast  And all the Tenor of his Soul is lost  To clear this Doubt to know the World by Sight  To find if Books or Swains report it right  He with the Sun a rising Journey went  Sedate to think and watching each Event  The Morn was wasted in the Pathless Grass  And long and lonesome was the Wild to pass  But when the southern Sun had warm'd the Day  A Youth came posting o'er a crossing Way  His rayment decent his complexion fair  And soft in graceful Ringlets wav'd his Hair  Then near approaching Father Hail he cry'd  And Hail my son the rev'rend Sire reply'd  Words followed Words from Questions Answers flow'd  And Talk of various kind deceiv'd the Road  Till each with other pleas'd and loth to part  While in their Age they differ join in Heart  Thus stands an aged Elm in Ivy bound  Thus youthful Ivy clasps an Elm around  Now sunk the Sun the closing Hour of Day  Came onward mantled o'er with Sober gray  Nature in Silence bid the World repose  When near the Road a stately Palace rose  It chanc'd the generous Master of the Dome  Still made his House the wand'ring Strangers Home  Yet still the Kindness from a thirst of Praise  Prov'd the vain flourish of expensive Ease  The Pair arrive The liv'ry'd Servants wait  Their Lord receives them at the pompous Gate  The Table groans with costly Piles of Food  And all is more than hospitable good  Then led to rest the Day's long Toil they drown  Deep sunk in sleep and Silk and Heaps of Down  At length 'tis Morn and at the Dawn of Day  Along the wide Canals the Zephyrs play  Up rise the Guests obedient to the call  An early Banquet deck't the splendid Hall  Rich luscious Wine a golden Vessel grac'd  Which the kind Master forc'd the Guests to taste  Then pleas'd and thankful from the Porch they go  And but the Landlord none had cause of Woe  His Cup was vanish'd for in secret Guise  The younger Guest purloin'd the glittering Prize  As one who spies a Serpent in his Way  Glist'ning and basking in the summers Ray  Disorder'd stops to shun the Danger near  Then walks with Faintness on and looks with Fear  So seem'd the Sire when far upon the Road  The shining spoil his wiley Partner show'd  He stopp'd with Silence walk'd with trembling Heart  And much he wish'd but durst not ask to part  Murmuring he lifts his Eyes and thinks it hard  That generous Actions meet a base Reward  While thus they pass the Sun his Glory shrouds  The changing Skies hang out their Sable Clouds  A Sound in Air presag'd approaching Rain  And Beasts to Covert scud across the Plain  Warn'd by the Signs the wand'ring Pair retreat  To seek for Shelter at a neighbouring Seat  'Twas built with Turrets on a rising Ground  And strong and large and unimprov'd around  Its Owner's Temper timorous and severe  Unkind and griping caus'd a Desart there  As near the Miser's heavy Doors they drew  Fierce rising Gusts with sudden Fury blew  The nimble Light'ning mix'd with Showers began  And o'er their Heads loud rolling Thunder ran  Here long they knock' but knock or call in vain  Driv'n by the Wind and batter'd by the Rain  At length some Pity warm'd the Master's Breast  'Twas then his Threshold first receiv'd a Guest  Slow creaking turns the Door with jealous Care  And half he welcomes in the shivering Pair  One frugal Faggot lights the naked Walls  And Natur's Fervor thro' their Limbs recalls  Bread of the coarsest Sort with eager Wine  Each hardly granted serv'd them both to dine  And when the Tempest first appear'd to cease  A ready Warning bid them part in Peaceâ–ª  With still Remark the pond'ring Hermit view'd  In one so rich a Life so poor and rude  And why should such within himself he cry'd  Lock the lost Wealth a Thousand want beside  But what new Marks of Wonder soon took place  In every settling Feature of his Face  When from his Vest the young Companion bore  That Cup the gen'rous Landlord own'd before  And paid profusely with the precious Bowl  The stinted Kindness of this churlish Soul  But now the Clouds in airy Tumult fly  The Sun emerging ope's an azure Sky  A fresher green the smelling Leaves display  And glitt'ring as they tremble cheer the Day  The Weather courts them from the Poor retreat  And the glad Master bolts the wary Gate  While hence they walk the Pilgrim's Bosom wrought  With all the Travel of uncertain Thought  His Partner's Acts without their Cause appear  'Twas there a Vice and seemed a Madness here  Detesting that and pitying this he goes  Lost and confounded with the various Shows  Now Night's dim Shades involve the azure Sky  Again they search and find a Lodging nigh  The Soil improv'd around the Mansion neat  And neither poorly low nor idly great  It seem'd to speak its Master's turn of Mind  Content and not for Praise but Virtue kind  Hither the Walkers turn with weary Feet  Then bless the Mansion and the Master greet  Their Greeting fair bestow'd with modest Guise  The courteous Master hears and thus replies  Without a vain without a grudging Heart  To him who gives us all I yield a Part  From Him you come for Him accept it here  A frank and sober more than costly Cheer  He spoke and bid the welcome Table spread  Then talk'd of Virtue till the Time of Bed  When the grave Houshold round his Hall repair  Warn'd by a Bell and close the Hours with Prayer  At length the World renew'd by calm Repose  Was strong for Toil the dappled Morn arose  Before the Pilgrims part the Younger crept  Near the clos'd Cradle where an Infant slept  And writh'd his Neck the Landlords little Pride  O strange Return grew black and gasped and dy'd  Horror of Horrors What his only Son  How look'd our Hermit when the Fact was done  Not Hell tho' Hell's black Jaws in sunder Part  And breathe blue Fire could more assault his Heart  Confus'd and struck with Silence at the Deed  He flies but trembling fails to fly with speed  His Steps the Youth pursues the Country lay  Perplex'd with Roads a Servant show'd the Way  A River cross'd the Path the Passage o'er  Was nice to find the Servant trod before  Long Arms of Oaks an open Bridge supply'd  And deep the Waves beneath them bending Glide  The Youth who seem'd to watch a time to Sin  Approach'd the careless Guide and thrust him in  Plunging he falls and rising lifts his Head  Then flashing turns and sinks among the Dead  Wild sparkling Rage inflames the Fathers Eyes  He bursts the Bands of Fear and madly cries  Detested WretchBut scarce his Speech began  When the strange Partner seem'd no longer Man  His youthful Face grew more serenely sweet  His Robe turn'd white and flow'd upon his Feet  Fair Rounds of radiant Points invest his Hair  Celestial Odours breath'd thro' purple Air  The Form Etherial bursts upon his Sight  And moves in all the Majesty of Light  Tho' loud at first the Pilgrim's Passion grew  Sudden he gaz'd and wist not what to do  Surprize in secret Chains his Words suspends  And in a Calm his settling Temper ends  But Silence here the beauteous Angel broke  The Voice of Musick ravish'd as he spoke  Thy Prayer thy Praise thy Life to Vice unknown  In sweet Memorial rise before the Throne  These Charms Success in our bright Region find  And force an Angel down to calm thy Mind  For this commission'd I forsook the Sky  Nay cease to kneelThy FellowServant I  Then know the Truth of Government Divine  And let these Scruples be no longer thine  The Maker justly claims that World he made  In this the Right of Providence is laid  Its sacred Majesty thro' all depends  On using second Means to Work his Ends  Tis thus withdrawn in State from human Eye  The Power exerts his Attributes on high  Your Actions uses nor controuls your Will  And bids the doubting Sons of Men be still  What strange Events can strike with more Surprise  Than those which lately struck thy wandering Eyes  Yet taught by these confess th' Almighty just  And where thou can't unriddle learn to trust  The great Vain Man who far'd on costly Food  Whose Life was too luxurious to be good  Who made his Ivory Stands with Goblets shine  And forc'd his Guests to morning Draughts of Wine  Has with the Cup the graceless Custom lost  And still he welcoms but with less of Cost  The mean suspicious Wretch whose bolted Door  Ne'er mov'd in Duty to the wandering Poor  With him I left the Cup to teach his Mind  That Heaven can bless if Mortals will be kind  Conscious of wanting worth he views the Bowl  And feels Compassion touch his grateful Soul  Thus Artists melt the sullen Oar of Lead  With heaping Coals of Fire upon its Head  In the kind Warmth the Metal learns to glow  And loose from Dross the Silver runs below  Long had our pious Friend in Virtue trod  But now this Child half wean'd his Heart from God  Child of his Age for him he liv'd in Pain  And measur'd back his Steps to Earth again  To great Excesses had his Dotage run  But God to save the Father took the Son  To all but thee in Fits he seem'd to go  And 'twas my Ministry to deal the Blow  The poor fond Parent humbled in the Dust  Now owns in Tears the Punishment is just  But how had all his Fortune felt a Wreck  Had that false Servant sped in Safety back  This Night his treasured Heaps he meant to steal  And what a Fund of Charity would fail  Thus Heaven instructs thy Mind this Tryal o'er  Depart in Peace resign and sin no more  On sounding Pinions here the Youth withdrew  The Sage stood wond'ring as the Seraph flew  Thus look't  Elisha  when to mount on high  His Master took the Chariot of the Sky  The fiery Pomp ascending left the View  The Prophet gaz'd and wish'd to follow too  The Hermit bending here a Prayer begun  "Lord as in Heaven on Earth thy Will be done  Then gladly turning sought his ancient Place  And pass'd a Life of Piety and Peace  THE Inspiration of God and the clear Information of the Holy Scriptures assures us that God reserves his choicest Secrets for the purest Minds and that its uncleaness of Spirit not difâˆ£ference of Method in seeking after God that separates us from him true Holiness being the only safe Entrance into divine Knowâˆ£ledge The Apostle  Peter  declares Act  That he perceived of a Truth that God is no respecter of Persons But in every Nation he that feareth him and worketh Righteousness is accepted with him  And the Apostle  Paul  also tells the  Galatians  Chap  That in Christ Jesus neither Circumcission availeth any Thing nor Uncircumcission but a new Creature  Notwithstanding the Clearness of these and many more such Doctrines contained in the Scriptures Selfishness and Partiaâˆ£lity those inhuman and base Qualities have been suffered to prevail even amongst such as are esteemed the most pious in the several Sects and Parties of the Christian Church They have raised and still raise in every Communion a selfish partial Orthodoxy which consists in courageously defending all its Opinions and Practices and condemning the Doctrines and Practices of others and thus every one is train'd up in Defence of their own Church their own Truth their own Opinion And he often is judged to have the most Merit and the most Honour who likes every Thing and deâˆ£fends every Thing amongst themselves and leaves nothing uncenâˆ£sured in those that are of a different Communion Now how can Truth Goodness and Religion be more struck at than by such Deâˆ£fenders of it If you ask why the great Bishop of  Meaux  wrote so many learned Books against all Parts of the Reformation it is beâˆ£cause he was born in  France  Had he been born in  England  had he been bred  at Oxford  or  Cambridge  he might have rivall'd our great Bishop  Stilling fleet  and would have wrote as many learn'd Folio's against the Church of  Rome  as he has done And yet I will venture to say that if each Church could produce but one Man a Piece that had the Piety of an Apostle and the impartial Love of the first Christians they would not want half a Sheet of Paper to hold their Articles of Union nor be half an Hour before they were of one Reliâˆ£gion If we loved Truth as such if we sought it for its own sake if we loved our neighbours as our selves if we desir'd nothing by our Religion but to be acceptable to God if we equally desir'd the Salâˆ£vation of all Men if we were afraid of Error only because of its hurtful Nature to us and our Brethren of other Communions then nothing of this Spirit could have any Place in us  For God is Love and they which dwell in God they dwell in Love    John  That uniâˆ£versal Love which gives the whole Strength of the Heart to God and which makes us love every Man as we love ourselves is the noblest the most divine and Godlike State of the Soul and is the utmost Perfection to which the most perfect Religion can raise us and no Religion does any Man any good but so far as it brings this perfect Love with it Perfection can no where be found but in a pure disinterested Love of God and our Neighbour There is  therefore a Communion of Saints in the Love of God which no one can learn from that which is called Orthodoxy in the different Sects but is only to be had by a total Dying to all worldly Views by a pure Love of God and by such an Unction from above as deâˆ£livers the Mind from all Selfishness and makes it love Truth and Goodness with an Equality of Affection in every Man let his Name and Profession to Religion be what it may And by thus uniting in Heart and Spirit with all that is holy and good in all professions we enter into the true Communion of Saints and become real Memâˆ£bers of the true universal Christian Church tho' we are confin'd to the outward Worship of only one particular Part of it It is thus that the Angels as ministring Spirits assist join unite and coopeâˆ£rate with every Thing that is holy and good in every Division of Mankind He that has been all his Life long used to look with great Slight upon those of other Professions whom he has called  Superstitious Biggots dreaming Visionaries canting Enthusiasts c  must naturally expect they will be treated by God as they have been by him and if he had the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven such People would find it hard to get a Place in it But it stands greatly in Hand to get rid of this Temper before we dye for if nothing but universal Love can enter into the Kingdom of God what can be more necessary for us than to be full of this Love before we dye  We often hear of People of great Zeal and Orthodoxy declaring on their DeathBeds their strict Attachment to the Church of Engâˆ£land and making solemn Protestations against all other Churches but how much better would it be if such a Person was to say  In this divided State of Christendom I must conform to some outward divided Part of it and therefore I have chosen to live and dye in outward Communion with the church of England fully believing that if I worship God in Spirit and in Truth in this divided Part of the Church I shall be as acceptable to him as if I had been a faithful Member of the one whole Church before it was broken into separate Parts But as I am now going out of this disordered Division into a more universal State of Things as I am going to the God of all Churches to a Kingdom of univerâˆ£sal Love which must have its Inhabitants from all People Natiâˆ£ons and Languages of the Earth so in this Spirit of universal Love I desire to perform my last Act of Communion in this dividâˆ£ed Church uniting and joining in Heart and Spirit with all that is Christian Holy Good and acceptable to God in all other Churches praying from the Bottom of my Soul that every Church may have its Saints that God's Kingdom may come his Will be done in every Division of Christians and Men and that every Thing that hath Breath may praise the Lord  THE Humble Meek Merciful Just Pious and Deâˆ£vout Souls are every where of one Religion and when Death has taken off the Mask they will know one another tho' the divers Liveries they wear here makes them Strangers Let us chuse to commune where there is the warmest Sense of Religion where Devotion exceeds Formality and Practice most corresponds with Profession and where there is at least as much Charity as Zeal For where this Society is to be found there shall we find the Church of God  Willam Penn's Refl Max  AN Eminent Servant of God who had known deliverâˆ£ance from the dark Powers and experimentally felt the Powers of the World to come a few Hours before his Death expressed himself in the following Words  There is a Spirit which I feel that delights to do no Evil nor to revenge any wrong but delights to endure all Things in Hopes to enjoy its own in the End Its Hope is to outlive all Wrath and Contention and to weary out all Exaltation and Cruelty or whatsoever is of a Nature contrary to itself it sees to the End of all Temptations as it bears no Evil in it self so it conceives none in Thought to any other for its Ground and Spring is the Mercies and Forgiveness of God its Crown is Meekness its Life is everlasting Love unfeigned and takes its Kingdom with Intreaty and not with Conâˆ£tention and keeps it by lowliness of Mind in God aâˆ£lone it can rejoice tho' none else regard it or can own its Life 'tis conceived in Sorrow and brought forth without any to pity it nor doth it murmur at Grief and Oppression it never rejoiceth but thro' Sufferings for with the World's Joy it is murdered I found it alone being forsaken I have Fellowship therein with them that lived in Dens and desolate Places of the Earth who through Death obtained Resurrection and eternal holy Life
