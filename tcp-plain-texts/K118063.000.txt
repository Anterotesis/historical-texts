CELEBRATED LECTURE ON HEADS  PART I  W  HEN a culprit is arraigned at the bar he holds up his hand submitting himself to providence and the laws of his country both my hands I hold up not arrogantly to provoke my trial but merely as a peti∣tioner for a patient hearing  By all the laws of laughing every man has an undoubted right to play the fool with himself under that license this exhibition is attemptedGood wine needs no bushthe bad deserves none if what I have to offer meets with your approbation you will ap∣plaud it if otherwise it will meet with the contempt it deserves Some of these heads are manufactured in wood and others in pasteboard to denote that there are not only Blockheads but Paper Sculls  This is one of those extraordinary personages called Conquerors He was called Alexander the Great from the great number of people his ambition had cut to pieces he was a most dexterous slaughterman and thought mankind only made for him to cut away with he was a great hero warrior and mankillerFor∣merly AndThis is the head of a Cherokee Chief called SachemSwampumScalpo TomahaukHe was a great hero warrior and mankillerLately And  This is the head of a quackdoctora greater mankiller than either of the other two This head of the quack doctor is exhibited to shew the weakness of wisdom and the strength of folly for if wisdom was not very weak would such fellows as  Carmen Coblers and Porters be permitted to vend their un∣wholesome mixtures under letters patentand if folly was not too strong would any body swallow their compositionsThe madness of  Alexander  this head made him a conquerorThe folly of the town dubb'd  The Quackdoctor  this a doctorThe exploits of Alexander are celebrated by half the great writers of the age and yet this Alex∣ander was nothing more than a murderer and a madman who ran from one end of the world to the other seeking whom he might cut to piecesand  Cherokee Chief  this coppercomplexioned hero wants no∣thing to make him as great as Alexander but the rust of antiquity to varnish over his crimes and the pens of writers to illustrate his actionsThe Quackdoctor is his own historian and publishes in the Daily Advertiser and Gazetteer accounts of cures never performed and copies of affidavits never sworn to  Here is the quackdoctor's coat of arms three ducks proper and Quack Quack Quack for the motto'Tis charged round with death's heads and by way of crest a number of quack puffs and bills of mortalityIt was made up for him by the worshipful company of Undertakers and presented to him by the Sextons and Gravediggers to denote that these people look upon Quackdoctors as their greatest benefactors  The ornaments of  The head of a Cuckold  this head are not for what the wearer has done on the contrary he bears about him the constant memo∣rial of the faults of others and is by the illjudging part of the world condemned for crimes he could not commit and the very commission of which constitute all his unhappiness These horns like the cornucopia of the antients signify plenty and denote that this head hath abundance of brethren in affliction they are gilt to shew that there are wretches base enough to accept the wages of dishonour even in a point the most delicateThis brass Buck'shead we all well know is made use of both in public and private houses nor had it been made in this shape but to accus∣tom mankind not only to the sight of horns but to the use of hanging their hats upon them  From the ancient custom of adorning the temple came the modern custom of embellishing the whole head Hence arose the wig manufactorythe consequence of which we shall endeavour to illustrate  A Counsellor's head  Here is a head and only a head a plain simple naked un∣imbellished appearance which in its present situation conveys to us no other idea than that of a bruiser preparing to fight at Broughton's Behold how naked how simple a thing Nature is But behold how luxuriant is  A large tye wig upon the head  Art What importance is now seated on these brows What reverence the features demand  What dignity is diffused on the whole countenanceThis is a compendium of the lawSpecial pleadings in the foretop pleas rejoinders replications and demurs in each turn of the headthe knotty points of practice in the twist of the tail the depth of the full bottom denotes the length of a chancery suit while the black coif at top like a blister plaister seems to tell us that the Law is a great irritator and never to be used but in very desperate casesBut as it is not enough to suppose a resemblance and as we have more blocks than one to try our wigs upon we will make an exchange and attempt an oration in praise of the law  Law law law is like a fine woman's tempera very diffi∣cult studyLaw law is like a book of surgerya great many terrible cases in itLaw it is like fire and water very good servants but very bad when they get the upper hand of us 'tis like a homely genteel woman very well to follow'tis also like a scolding wife very bad when it follows usand again it is like bad weather most people chuse to keep out of it In law In law there are four parts the Quid libet the Quod libet the Quid pro quo and the Sine qua nonImprimis the Quid libet or who began first because in all actions of assault the law is clear that primus strokus is absolutus malus sine jokus which being elegantly and classically rendered into English is that whosoever he be that gave the first stroke it was absolute ill and without a joke  Secondly the Quod libet or the damages but that the law has nothing to do with only to state them for whatever da∣mages ensue they are all the client's perquisites according to that ancient Norman mottoIf he is cast or castandum he is semper idem ruinandum  Thirdly the Quid pro quo feeing councilGiving words for money or having money for words according to that ancient Norman motto "Si curat lex"We live to perplex  Fourthly the Sina qua non or without something what would any thing be good for Without this wig what would the out∣lines of the law be good for  I shall illustrate this by a case in point Peere Williams p Daniel against Dishclout Plaintiff Daniel was groom in the same family where defendant Dishclout was cook Plaintiff Daniel had been drinking or as Dr Bibbibus has it in his dissertation on bumpers he was Homo Duplicans that is he was a double man he was not as he should be ipse he but as he should not be tipse he Plaintiff Daniel made a forcible entry on the cook's premisses the kitchenNow the kitchen according to Serjeant Plodding as he has it in his th vol folio of the abridgement of the statures page there he says that the kitchen is Ca∣mera necessaria in usu cookeraro where she has the overlooking the conduct the management the supervising the feeing to the superintendance and the speculation of all the sauspannis slew∣pannis  frienpannis et stovis smoke jacko and where our cook was at this time employed in all the duties of her office where she was roastandum boilandum fyrandum frigaseyandum et plumb pludding magnum mixandum At this time Plaintiff Da∣niel made a forcible entry c and demanded a sop in the pan defendant Dishclout insisted on her right of refusala sop in the pan gemmen is a very serious thing and without perquisites what are all honours and places good for Nothing more than an embroidered button hole and if we consider a minister of state as the nation's cook then perquisites are the sop in the pan to the minister of state with which omnium gatherum choose to grease their fingersWell Plaintiff Daniel demanded a sop in the pan Defendant Dishclout insisted on a right of refusal Daniel seized Dishclout by the left hand there was the Quid libet or the assault  Dishclout took Daniel by the right hand and pulled him into the dripping pan there was the damagesthe dripping pan Now if the drippingpan had not been there he could not have fallen into the dripping pan and if he had not been there the dripping pan could not have received him And this is law and the loquaciousness of the law is multi loquacious foras∣much nevertheless likewise moreover and alsoThe liberty of the Law is the happiness of the English and it is very happy for us Englishmen that we have the liberty to go to law  Here is a wig as stiff as if chisseled out of a stone by a cutter and as unnatural as Chinese ornaments and yet these wigs and the wearers of them too are in fashion in some parts of the town and thus plaistered like the top of a cabbage plant after a shower of snow 'tis called the Journeyman's Jemmy And  This is Sir Languish Lispy these creatures adorn the outside of their heads to attack ladies hearts and they are promoted to places in he service of the ladies in proportion to their respective merits they are teacup carriers fan bearers and snuff box hold∣ers This is the He at the one end of the down and this is the He at the other end of the town It would perhaps give pain to any one of this audience to have such a pomatum cake pasted to their heads but the extreme delicate creatures these represent sel∣dom make any other use of their heads than to have their hair or wigs dressed upon them They smile and simper they ogle they admire every lady and every lady alike Nay they copy the manners of the ladies so closely that grammarians are at a loss whe∣ther to rank them with the masculine or feminine and therefore put them down as the Doubtful GenderThese wigs from the quantity of powder that is lavished upon them are called Ammu∣nition caxons and thus sweetened over like the sugar at the top of a twelf cake may seem to denote that the wearers must needs be very sweet fellows  Here is a full frizzel bobThe wearer of this wig looks like an ostrich in a fright as if he had run his head into a bush and  brought it away with him about his arsWigs may be considered as bearing great analogy to books this then will be an huge quarto in large paper as this is a duodecimo in small print and belongs to Mr Donefirst the long oddslayer and here is his man "Cross and jostle in" sweated down to ride a sweepstakes and thus dressed in true turf taste they are called a brace of "knowing ones"The head of a horse jockey and a jockey's horse may be said to have great affinity because the jockey's head can pull the horse's head on which side the post he pleases but what sort of heads must those people have who know these things are done and yet trust their capitals with such sinking funds but we shall forbear to say any more on this head for fear of offending those high personages who choose to resemble grooms and horse jockeysA conversation should have been formed for these heads and they should have talked on various subjects such as politicks religion and cold cream eau de luce lavender water demyreps and French chicken gloves But as all that has been said is to no purpose and as least said is soonest mended and as those that say nothing cannot be blamed for speaking we have chosen to exhibit these Capitals as mutes and hope the audience won't take offence at itSome heads are mute because they have nothing to say some should be mute because they say nothing to the purpose some men say nothing at all to their wives and some married men would be extremely happy if their wives said nothing at all to them  This is Nobody's head or the head of Nobody because thus adorned with the fool's cap nobody chuses to own itHistorians have left us in the dark with respect to these long ear'd bonnets but it is however supposed that the first who wore them was Judge Midas who had the inimitable art of turning every thing he touched into gold and now touch some people with gold and you may make any thing of them money getting consisting in the art of making fools or of properly suffering ourselves to be made fools of  Life is said to be a lottery and Folly concerned in the chances Now let us see if this fool's cap has any prizesThis may appear as a satyr against card playing but 'tis not a just one on the con∣trary most card players are said to belong to  Four knaves held up  this family and generally bear their name they are called court cards because when turned up trumps they become honoursWhich shews if you deal fairly you may gain honours and that often honours or no honours depend entirely on a shuffle  This crest belongs to those easy kind of mortals who are said to be nobody's enemy but their own They are divided into three classes there are your generous fellowsyour honest fellows and your devilish clever sellowsAs to your generous fellow he is treat master you honest fellow he is toast master you devilish  clever fellow he is singing master who is to keep the company alive for four or five hours and then your devilish honest fel∣low is to drink them all deadThey married into Folly's family and got this crest"the fool's cap"And which to this day nobody chuses to be known by  If you ask why we so frequently use the term nothing let this serve as a reason from ten to twenty we go to school to learn what from twenty to thirty we are strangely apt to forget from thirty to forty we think things must needs be as we would have them from forty to fifty we find ourselves a little out in our reck∣oning and from fifty to sixty upon casting up life's debtor and creditor we find  A board held up with a parcel of noughts  this the certain ballanceThese are a number of nothings which in their present state have no power or con∣sequence yet by the addition of one they take rank and prece∣dence immediately which shews that in life as well as arithmetic nothing may be turned into something by the assistance of any one lord of a golden manor take away the one and they are nothing againTo nothing we must all come happy they who amidst the variations of nothing have done nothing to be ashamed of If they have nothing to fear they have every thing to hopeThus ends the dissertation on nothing which the exhibitor hopes he has properly executedby making nothing of it  From the dissertation on nothing we come to Nobody's gene∣alogical tablesThis is nobody's crest because whoever this may suit nobody cares to own itThis is somebody's crest "a screen" because in all political disputes somebody is supposed to be behind the screenThis coat of legs and arms belongs to those easy kind of mortals who are always throwing their legs and arms about 'em restless every where at home no where how they live nobody knows and how they die nobody cares However in∣significant this may appear yet that is of no small importance for the moment a man begins to fancy himself something he assumes a big look we have therefore given him a big belly with a vast corporation as for the absent members let them be thus made out let the mayor be the head the two sheriffs the arms as they execute the law the aldermen the legs as they support the chair and as to the eyes nose mouth c why let them be composed of a committee of common councilmen and so the corporation is made out  This is any body's coat of arms the shield is blank a blank for the crest it being as easy nowadays to buy a coat of arms as any other coatThe Herald's office is the true Monmouthstreet in the parish of Pedigree It is Honour's piece broker's shop where every remnant of reputation is to be purchased It should seem as if the Herald's office had the virtue of Medea's kettle where every plebeian vulgarity is boiled away and out they come spick and span new gentlefolks  This is every body's coat of armsa bag of money and hands catching at it money reaping being mankind's universal harvest work we have given a death's head to every body's coat of arms being the exact likeness of every body drawn after the life  It may seem strange that we should exhibit such terms as esteem generosity friendship gratitude public spirit and common sense as belonging to nobody's family but the truth is that these fine qualifications have been so ill used that nobody cared to own them The consequence of which was that they were ordered into the workhouse but the parish officers unanimously agreed that they should have no admittance there Mr Overseer standing up and saying that as howin the first place imprimis first of all and foremostGemmen of the westry Why what business have we with friendship I take it that as how the best friend a man has is a man's own money in a man's own pocket and friendship is nothing more or less as I take it in the whole versal world but to borrow a man's money out of a man's pocket I come now to your grati∣tudes and I take your gratitudes to be a sort of a foreign lingo which we English folk have nothing at all to do with to be sure there was such a person when Doasyouwouldbedoneby was member of parliament And ye know gemmen of the westry since Self Interest was made receiver general Gratitude has been turned out of the county  Mr Head borough slowly rising from his chair and gravely snuff∣ing the candle begged leave to be hardand he said that as how whereof and wherefore not so much for the saying of the thing as tho'f it should be said though to be sure no man should be sartain sure of his own judgement yet for his part now as to your generosity he look's upon it to be a sort of a something of a foreign plant and we have nothing to do with itAnd as to your public spirit why ye know gemmen of the westry I need not tell you that is nothing more than a licence for publicans to fell spirituous liquors And as to your esteem why some people esteem brandy punch and some people esteem rum punch for my part give me a little sup of your rum punch and if I was the people of Jamaica if the people of England would not drink rum punch why they should have no turtle and then they would all be starved And  Now gemmen of the westry I come to my imprimis third and last and that is your common sense if I may be allowed to speak my reflexions about it I look upon it to be too common and too vulgar a thing for the gemmen of the westry to trouble their heads with or be consarned about  All these fine qualifications must have perished in oblivion had not Chance recommended them to the family of Ostentation Here is the lady of Ostentation's manor her name was Vanity She had a sister named Wit who ran away with Judgement the house stew∣ard from which two was begat Genius but as it's very common  to use Genius ill so she suffered many and great hardships till at length she was reduced to so low an ebb as to be obliged to lodge in a garret with the poet Oblivion and his mother Necessity In process of time Judgement her father found her out and pro∣moted a marriage between Genius and Science and from that mar∣riage were produced these five sine children Architecture Painting Poetry Astronomy and Music But the disturbance at that time between the Goths and the Vandals having overturned the temples of the Arts and Sciences these scientifics took shipping and a storm arising at sea they were shipwreck'd on the inhospitable coast of Sussex where after being plundered of their wearing apparel they were left to starve by the inhumanity of the country people The reason why our sea side savages may rob and plunder shipwrecked passengers with impunity is owing to a defect in the Game Act which was made for the preservation of the Game all over England the gentlemen who drew up that act forgetting to make men women and children game though it is so common nowadays to make game of men women and children They begged their way up to London on foot where they were in hopes that the merit of their works would recommend them poor creatures 'tis a sign they knew very little of the world to imagine any such thing however to prevent starving Architecture turned bricklayer's la∣bourer to a Chinese builder Painting was a grinder of colours to a paper stainer Poetry turned Printer's Devil Music sung ballads about the streets and Astronomy cried Almanacks In some little time lady Fashion found them out and as soon as lady Fashion found them out all the world ran mad for their company  This is a most curious exhibition and very likely to make the learned look about them for as there is no mark or sign to discover what it is 'tis a sure proof of it's being a genuine antiqueIt may for ought we know be a king Solomon or Queen Sameri∣mis an Old Venus or a New Nabob a Methodist Preacher or a Bottle Conjuror It was intended to place the face of Probability upon it but that motion was soon laid aside as people in our days are only fond of improbabilities at length a part of the bronze or plaister being rubbed off a letter was discovered by which it appeared to be the remains of the statue of Honesty thus mauled and mutilated by the various inroads that had been made upon itImagine not spectators that this bust of Honesty is ex∣hibited as if the real face would be a stranger to any one of this companyNoShe is only shewn here emblematically the meaning of which is that the manners of the times are such as may put Honesty out of countenanceNot as a companion but as a contrast to the head of Honesty is  This the head of Flattery exhibited The ancients had days they called White or Lucky days thus it is wiith Flattery to the fortunate she turns her white her shining side to the unfortunate she is ever in eclipse Upon the approach of any ill fortune Flat∣tery  generally turns into Reproach the meaning of which is that it is a reproach to our understandings to suffer Flattery yet we con∣tinue to accept the injury though we despise the hand that offers it not remembering that the receiver is as bad as the thief  This being Flattery was begot on Poverty by Wit which is the reason why poor wits are generally the greatest flatterers  This Flattery was employed by the princes of the earth to carry their congratulations one to another but being at a certain time dispatched by the Dutch with a card of compliments to the Hotten∣tots the ship she went in was taken by a pyrate the captain of which fell in love Flattery left off the sea for her sake took an inn set up and made Flattery his barkeeper a gentleman ar∣riving in those parts in pursuit of an heiress and having tried all efforts in vain at last purchased Flattery of the innkeeper and by her means gained the lady But to see the ingratitude of man kind he had not been married a fort'night before he kick'd Flattery out of doors and from that time to this she has had no settled place of abode but is usually to be found at the beginning of court∣ship and at the latter end of a petition This being Flattery was the occasion of the very first duel that ever was fought she was placed at the top of a pyramid in the middle of an highway where four roads met two knights adventurers the one from the north and the other from the south arrived at the pyramid at the same instant the hero from the south who saw this white side said it was a shame that a white a silver profile should be trusted on the highway side The hero from the north who only saw this saidA white a silver profile why it is a black one Flat contradictions produced fatal demonstrations their swords flew out and they cut and hewed one another in a most unmerciful manner till fainting with the loss of blood they both fell down each on the opposite side to that on which the combat begun when look∣ing up too late they belield their mistake At this instant a ve∣nerable hermit coming by boundup their wounds and replaced them on their horses giving them this piece of friendly advice  That hence forward in all political disputes and matters of a public nature never to trust themselves till they had examined both sides of the question  PART II  IN the first part of this lecture we considered men's heads in this second part we shall consider the head dress of the fine ladies for as the world is round and the world turns round and every thing turns round with it so no lunar or sublunar revolution hath caused greater alteration in the affairs of men than hath from time to time take place in the head dresses of the ladies  From the Egyptians from whom we derive all our arts and sci∣ences philosophy and fashions our good dames of antiquity seem to have borrowed this ridinghood Behold the ridinghood how the lappets fall down the side of the face like the lappets on the side of the face of the Egyptian mummy or like the cumb'rous fo∣liages of the fullbottom'd peruke but our ancestors disliking the use of these fullbottoms contrived a method of tying up their wigs behind hence the origin of tyewigsThe ladies too not to be behindhand with the gentlemen in their fashions contrived a way to tye up their tails too and from the ridinghood they tucked up their tails and form'd the Ranelaghhood as for ex∣ample  This is the hood in high taste at the lower end of the town and while this is wore by lady Mary lady Betty lady Susan and wo∣men of great distinction this is wore by plain Moll and Bess and Sue and women without any distinction at all This is the inva∣riable mode or headdress of those ladies who used to supply the court end of the town with sea dainties before land carriage for fish came into fashion And there is not more difference between the head dress of these ladies than in their mode of conversation for while these fine ladies are continually making inroads upon their mother tongue and clipping polysyllables into monosyllables as when they tell us they caant and they shaant and they maant these coarse ladies make ample amends for their deficiency by the addition of supernumerary syllables when they talk of breakfastes and toasteses and running their fisteses against the posteses  These are the antient laughing and crying philosophers perpe∣tual presidents of the noble and venerable orders of the Groaners and the Grinners This the president of the dismal faction is al∣ways crying for fear the world should not last his time outthis the member of the Choice Spirits egad he don't care whether it does or not This laughs at the times this cries at the times and this blackguards the times and thus the times are generally handled Old people praise the times past which they neglected to use when they might young people look forward with anxious care to the time to come neglecting the present and almost all people treat the present times as some folks do their wiveswith indifference because they may possess them  This was the fashionable mode or head dress in the times of our forefathers and foremothers when a member of parliament's wife was jogged up to town once a year behind John just to see my Lord Mayor's shew and have her gown cut to the court fashion and then with her pillion new stuffed and her lap crammed with con∣fectionary she was hoisted back again as fine as a gingerbread stall upon a fair day From Minerva's helmet the ladies seem to have taken the custom of wearing bonnets the pompoon or egret from the half moon that encircled the temple of Diana  From the ancients too came this custom of giving lectures Juno that termagant of antiquity being the first who ever gave her husband a lecture and which from the place where it was de∣livered was called a curtain lecture And philosophers are of opi∣nion that these curtain lectures are not yet entirely out of fashion  Homer the historian from whom all these facts are taken relates great things of the zone or girdle of Venusand to it he ascribes great virtue he says that whatever lady wears Venus's girdle will infallibly possess the beauties of Venus Now ladies I have that very girdle mentioned by Homer and every lady will look lovely as long as she chuses to appear in it  Good Temper  This is a real antique the morning head dress of that celebrated demirep of antiquity Cleopatra this is what astronomers call the night rain or shrouding the moon in a cloud and to this day the ladies of Edinburgh when they go abroad in the morning fold a tarpin about their heads or as they express it they heep their heeds about in plaid But our ladies in the south disliking so cum∣b'rous a fashion and imagining that something whimsically like it might be the invention of a new fashion invented this French night cap or cheek wrapper A lady in this dress looks hooded like a horse with eyeflapsto keep them from looking one way or the other and perhaps that is the reason why most ladies in our days choose to look forward One would imagine that this cap was invented by some surly duana or illnatured guardian who being past the relish of beauty themselves would deny even the fight of it to the rest of mankind  Since we are on the subject of ladies faces permit me a word on the pernicious practice of face painting or rubbing of rouge and white wash on the complexion Women of the town may be al∣lowed the use of paint because the dexterity of their profession like that of pirates consists in fighting under false colours But for the delicate the unculpable part of the sex to paint looks as if they would fish for lovers as men do for mackrelby hanging something red upon the hook or as if they thought men were ge∣nerally of the bull and turkey cock kind and would sly at any thing scarlet Exercise is the best face painter innocence the best giver of complexion There is however a certain period in life  among the ladies no less an enemy to the face than the custom of face painting 'tis called antiquated virginity when elderly un∣married ladies are supposed to be condemned to lead apes about because when they were young and handsome they made monkies of mankind Shakespear has beautifully described the difference of the two states in these few lines thus  But earthly happier is the rose distill'd  Than that which withering on the virgin thorn  Lives grows and dies in single blessedness  We have here two heads taken from these lines of Shakespear This is the married rose and this is that withering on the virgin thorn Disappointments bring on wrinkles the wrinkles there∣fore of this face are no cause for wonder the best wines if kept too long will turn to vinegar But as this subject seems to grow serious we'll dismiss it with a wish  "May each married lady preserve her good man  "And the young ones get good ones as soon as they can"  Not to be partial to either sex this is exhibited as the head of an old batchelor These old batchelors are mere bullies in love continually abusing matrimony without daring to accept the chal∣lenge They tell ye if they were married their wives should not go abroad when they please the children should never cry the men should not kiss the maids O they would do mighty matters But these lionlike talkers abroad are mere baalambs at home and continually under subjection to some termagant of a mistress who makes them amply repay to her insolence the contempt in which they pretend to have held the worthier part of the sex As a pu∣nishment for their infidelity when they are old and superannuated they set up for suitors they ogle through spectacles and they sing love songs with catarrhs by way of symphony This laced coat solitaire and bag wig shew what he would be and this fool's cap what he is  As this is an head in ancient primitive simplicity so here is an head in modern simplicity and belongs to a lass of the spirit usu∣ally called a Quaker And  This is the head of one moved by the spirit He wears this large umbrella like covering to keep off the outer light to strengthen the light within As this is the hat of one moved by the spirit so  This is a hat in the true spirit of the mode This is a Niverne or a Nivernoise or a Nivernoise or a Never enough it's all the same in the Greek a fellow with such a hat as this looks like a man coming from market with a skimming dish on his head The French perhaps have acted wisely in curtailing the size of their hats because we have curtailed them of the fur trade but for Englishmen to wear such hats is neither sound policy or common honesty yet we persist in copying the manners of the  French though we know they despise us for imitationAs there are two hats contrasted so here are two heads contrasted  This a plain honest well meaning manly sentiment speak∣ing countenance This with a French grin and simper seems to say  Entendez vous Monsieur entendez vous Sire you have no complaisance  To whom this replies  But Sir we have sincerity  Sire we have de gran monarch  And we liberty  Sire we come over to England every year to learn you  And yet sir we are very much your masters  Point du tout Point du tout Not at all not at all You beat us in one part and we go to anoder The French be de vise people they go all over the world to get money  And the English they go all over the world to spend it  PART III  IN the first part of this lecture we considered wigs lexiconi∣cally in this part we shall consider them physically or rather a physical wig not as it relates to the faculty but only with an intent to shew how some of the faculty treat their heads This wig is charactura of both doctor and apothecary according to the doctrine of topsy turvey which supposes that any apo∣thecary may be a doctor though no doctor can be an apothe∣cary  Presuming we may now look something like some of the faculty we shall attempt a dissertation on Sneezing and Snufftaking and this we shall endeavour to execute in the true secundumartemmedicum phrase which may serve either for doctor or apothecarySneezing otherwise learnedly called sternutation is occasioned by a violent involuntary impression repression compression sup∣pression and oppression of the animal spirits and nervous  luids which acting on the nerves which are subservient to the muscles and the diaphragma communicate the same vibration otherwise oscellations of the medellary substance of the nerves and excite those impulses and concussion of the thorax which accompany ster∣nutation by which means the patient is in such a sort of a kind of situation thatif he has a pocket handkerchief he may wipe his nose with it There are several sorts of snuff physical and meta∣physical With physical snuff the town has been sufficiently pester∣ed Let us consider metaphysical And first  The snuff of Self consequence upon the sudden accession of any good fortune Pride usually presents the possessor with a box of the snuff of Self consequence On opening the lid the dust flies  into his eyes and prevents his recollecting any of his old acquaint∣ance On these occasions the eyes of the Snuff taker are so in∣jured that he cannot recognize those very friends whom perhaps but the day before he would have been glad to have received a dinner fromthen  There is the snuff of Contempt this is sure to be taken by all well dressed persons when they are in company with others with worse cloaths on than themselves for though we know there is a material difference between real genius and Monmouthstreet finery yet the Pantheon of Parade shall have crouded auditors while the Temple of Merit stands open without a worshipper When the performance of an English artist is exhibited as the work of a master unknown its merit will have due praise but the mo∣ment his name is known and he is found guilty of being an Eng∣lishman admiration changes into disgust and the club of connois∣seurs take the snuff of Contempt at him and his works immediately PshawPaltryDamn'd badVile c c  Englishmen are supposed to be meer John Trots incapable of of any thing but hauling a rope or pulling a trigger nor would merit have been allowed in this particular had not our soldiers and sailors so very lately shewn all over the world such capital ex∣hibitions  With these heads we intended to have begun our dissection This is the head of a blood he wears a bull's forehead for a fore∣top in imitation of that blood of old Jupiter who turned him∣self into a bull to run away with Europa and to this day your bloods are mighty fond of making beasts of themselves this is a fine fellow to kick up a dust or to keep it up when it is kicked up to chuck a waiter behind the fire toss a beggar in a blanket play at chuck with china plates hop round the room with a red hot poker in his mouth upon one leg say the belief backwards swallow red hot coals Oh he was quite the thing He was a wit at Wetherby's a toastmaster at Bob Derry's a constant customer at the Roundhouse a terror to modest women and a dupe to women of the town as one of whom  This portait is exhibited This is a man of the town or a blood and this is a woman of the town or abut by what other title the lady chuses to be called we are not entitled to mention suffice it to say that when we attempted dissection we found this head proof against our keenest apparatus and this so soft that it mouldered away at the first touch  This is the Teatable Critic or master among the maids He was mama's darling His mama would never let him learn to read for fear he should get a naasty custom of holding down his head but he was a purdigious scholar for all that he had got four pages of Hoyle by heart which his mama's woman had taught him and he could calculate ho could calculate how much cream should be put into a codling tart He died of a fit of despair for the loss of  his lapdog who was poisoned with eating up the cold cream that was prepared for his mama's next day's complexion We di∣vided the suters of his brain with an ivory bodkin but instead of the cutis and the cuticula the cerebum and the cerebellum medula oblong and other hard words we found nothing of them and for brains we discovered this pincushion From the Teatable Critic we proceed to the Learned Critic or Wordgrubber  This was an hunter after commas semicolons and underevatas This is a true classical conjugating countenance and denotes dicti∣onary dignity He was one of those learned Doctoribus's who al∣ways argued Propria quae maribus He has for a band a pair of horn books to denote that he was a man of mere letters He lost his best friend in a dispute relative to the pronunciation of a word as he was one day walking in his friend's garden little miss came running to him "Sir" said she  my papa's horse Cicero has won the race  foaming with rage our grammarian bounces into the parlour "Madam" says he  Why do you bring up your children thus How dare you suffer these violations of all grammar you'll be the very destruction of all learning and of all common sense for the pronunciation of the word is not Cicero but Kickero  Nature never does her works by halves she proportions the parts of all animals to the use for which they are designed thus the ears of this critic are immensely large they are called trap doors to catch syllables On the con∣trary his eyes are half closed that's called the Wiseman's Wink and shews he can see the world with half an eye He died of in∣sanity of mind or furor mentis occasioned by a dispute relating to the restoring of oiled butter he said butter once oiled could ne∣ver be restored and he proved it from the Greek too at the very fame interim in came Betty the cook maid with a little sprinkling of flower and no Greek and restored it in a moment When we came to a dissection of this head instead of the hard terms used by anatomists we found none of the parts thereby described we found only large fragments of abuse epitomes of indexes and title pages and all the brain covered over with a blotting paper Be∣fore we opened  This stockjobber's head we had a mind to make an experiment upon the ear but as to notes of music the cries of distress the praise of merit and the demand of gratitude the stockjobber's head was like his stock consolidated We then thought of a me∣thod of striking one piece of money against another we did so We struck one shilling against another the chink of the money alarmed the member and on our striking one guinea against ano∣ther the ear expanded to its utmost extent in other subjects there are certain vessels that convey to the face a consciousness of guilt or the glow of innocence In the stockjobber they were all petrified In other subjects there are certain vessels between the  head and the heart called the nerves of humanity in the stockjobber they were all eaten up by the scurvy  This is Sir Full Fed Domine Double Chin citizen turtle and venison eater He was one of the common council of Farringdon within he was a very good sort of a man he was half brother to an alderman and had been deputy of his ward his time was taken up in the affairs of the state and the affairs of a kitchen He loved politics and he loved venison He thought a cook was the greatest genius in all the 'varsal world except a news writer He constantly read every political pamphlet that was published and on both sides of the question and always framed his opinion according to the writer he read last and according to the humour he happened to be in he would take his cap and his pipe and a glass of the righteous as he called it and he would be for setting the world to rights in an hurry Ay Ay neighbour Coster all for their own ends now adays all for their own ends nobody do you see now adays loves their own country since queen Semaramus and she invented Solomon Gundy and that's the best eating in all the 'varsal world It I was at the head of affairs things should not be as they are now that's all they shouldn't indeed I would shew them another way of a manner of going to work now I'll shew you my plan of operations Do you mind me now mark what I say suppose then these two or three bits of tobacco ashes to be the main land continentVery well and suppose now neighbour Spriggins this little drop of milk punch well come here's the king God bless him suppose this little drop of milk punch to be the main sea ocean very well very well and suppose these three or four bits of cork to be all our great men of war very well But what shall I do now for fortified places Oh here I have it here I have it Here's your Havannahs and your Pondicherries and your Tilbury Ports and your Tower Ditches and all your damn'd strong places there's a plan of operations for ye now Ah Well and then our army all should wear a new uniform all our horse infantry should wear air jackets and all our foot cavalry should wear cork waistcoats and then ye know why they'd be all over the sea before you could say Jack Robinson Well and where do you think I'd land them now You don't know nor you don't know how the devil should you know You don't understand geometry Why I'll tell you where I'd land them I would land them under the line close by the South Pole there I'd land them and then I'd ambuscade all the Spaniards back settlements and take from them all their Pshaw You know what I mean well enough all theirall them damn'd hard names mentioned in the news papers all their Mexicos and their Perus and their Dimont Islands and then I'd come with a circumbendibus on the Dutch in flat bottom'd boats because ye know that is a flat bottom'd country open the sluiceslet in the waterdrown all the poor Dutch and then we should have the  turtles and the Spice Islands for n in Old England  While our politician was thus going on with his plan censuring men and measures he knew nothing about and it happening at a time when our army lay encamped on one side of the river and the French on the other an officer in company with his stick gave our politician a wrap on the knuckles What's that for Ay Only Sir replied the officer coolly to inform you that that commander who crosses a river to attack an enemy in front may chance to get a wrap on the knuckles that's all The tran∣sition is easy from politicks to cunning  Behold here the head of a sharper In Truth's Dictionary under the article Cunning is the verb to sharp from whence the noun substantive sharper that we may offend no countrymen by the birth of our hero be it known that he was born at sea on board a transport in which his mother was humbly requested by a rule of court to take a seven years tour to America At length by his unshaken resolution and matchless impudence he acquired a for∣tune of forty thousand pounds  This is his original face a heavy vulgar incurious downlooking countenance this was his holliday face that he went into company with and under this mask of affability he play'd off all his slight of hand artillery and this was his face when he awoke at midnight when Conscience assisted by Memory com∣manded him to undergo a severe self examination for as there was nothing too base for him to commit so neither was there any thing so dreadful but he had reason to fear He lived in the ut∣most dread and died in the utmost despair putting a period to his existence with this which in the catalogue of medicines bears this name  Suicide's GrandSpecific  He left all his fortune to the hospital for incurables in Moorfields that as he had got all his money by the incurables so he was very willing now he could make no farther use of it to return it to the right owners  Although he had lived a life so infamous he was buried in all the to be purchased pomp behold here the funeral of the gambler and two of his torch bearers Such is the partiality of fate and such the different rewards of merit and infamy that that soldier and sailor are employed at the price of a shilling and glad too of that scanty pittance to attend the gambler to his grave the sailor lost his arm in one of the famous sea fights where Sir Edward Hawke commanded and the soldier lost his leg in one of the sixregiments who so bravely fought upon the plains of Minden To shew however how we treat our soldiers and sailors when we have no occasion for them we will just beg leave to relate a story that happened in the year when our army was marching into the North under the command of the gallant Duke of Cumber∣land  The landlord of the house where one of the soldiers hap∣pened to be began to take great notice of him and would say to him why honest fellow says he you soldiers are the pillars of the nation you are the bravest men in nature without a standing army we should have no standing corn when you come home pray come and see me you and your wife and your children and stay as long as you please a week a month or a year as long as you please and make yourselves welcome to every thing you find here and he always wound up his invitation with telling him that soldiers were the pillars of the nation When the affair at Culloden was happily over our soldier called rather to thank him for his kind invitation than with any design to accept it But the danger being past and peace being restored be began to talk about large taxes and standing armies and he did not know what occasion there was for a pack of lobstering dogs to be crawling about the country eating up peoples victuals and drink He saw no occasion we had for soldiers now not he we had peace hadn't we Why cried our soldier with a generous disdain I did not invite myself did not you tell me to come me and my family and we should be welcome and says he did not you al∣ways close your invitation with saying that we soldiers were the pillars of the nationpillars of the nationWell I be∣lieve I might say something about pillars but I meantcatter∣pillars  Thus while true merit is neglected and despised to shew how Genius and Science can condescend to decorate unworthiness behold here the monument of the GamblerJustice and Com∣passion weeping over his medallion and Honour descending with a crown of laurels to reward his virtues in the bassorelief are four little boys representing the cardinal virtues as weeping for his death but we who are apt to moralize on things rather think they are four little boys whose parents the gambler has ruined and that they are now turned out of doors and crying for cloaths to cover themThis is the head of another kind of sharper 'tis the head of a Conjuror or FortuneTeller not that he could see any further into futurity than other mortals no his art lay chiefly in a nice observation of the follies and passions which actuated the human species but chiefly the fair part of the cre∣ation and by the help of a wand gown long beard an old globe and other abstruce trumpery he persuaded his easy auditors that he conversed with the stars and according to the fee they gave him he would deliver his plausible prognostics  For wishing nymphs he soon would find  A husband wealthy handsome kind  And for the ambitious he would six  A coronet a coach and six  He'd give the avaricious store  And food and raiment to the poor  In short whatever their degree  He'd suit their wishes to a T  Most people thought that he conversed with the Devil yet to shew how little acquaintance he had with him he was frightened to death by the appearance of a large black dog and the strength of imagination which made him believe the candles burnt blue From the head of one who lived by his wit we proceed to a real wit this is the famous Yorick mentioned by Shakespear and Tristram Shandy and he is supposed to have a good deal of the family likeness when we came to a dissection of this head we found one lobe of the brain swelled to a pro∣digious size and the other wasted almost to nothing he lived so long depending on what others would do for him that he was at length reduced to the necessity of asking Charity amongst others of his resting places he one day set himself down at the door of a large mansionhouse some of the ser∣vants hearing he was a Wit had him into the steward's par∣lour and where according to the notion some people have of wit they desired he would be comical One of them said if he was a wit to be sure he could run round the room with a red hot poker between his teethThe cookmaid said to be sure if the gentleman was a wit she hoped he would be so kind and so civil and so obliging and so condescending and so complaisant and so good and so submissive as to tell her fortune on the cards The butler was rather for a tune on the musical glasses The groom said if so be as how the gentleman was a wit why he could not do no less than ride three horses at onceThe laundry maid she said to be sure he could swallow a boxiron and heatersWhile they were thus debating down came the French Mammeselle and ordered him to be turned out of doors saying "she wondered vat English vit vas good for"  Wit being thus turned out of doors went to visit Hospitality but it being election time there was no room for him there He then paid his addresses to Merit but Merit could do nothing for him being at that time pursued by Faction He then ad∣dressed himself to Charity and she would have done any thing in the world to serve him but as ill luck would have it she was herself that very morning ran over by the bishop's new set of coach horses He died at length of mere hunger and was in∣terred in the poor's burialground after his friends had raised money to pay the surplice fees  And the modes of Christianity are such in our days that though any churchman may receive large benefices yet if any churchman be found guilty of giving away any of the church's money in cha∣rity he would be thought guilty of being righteous overmuch  Behold here one of the righteous overmuchyet nought doth he give away in charity No no he is the bellweather of the flock who hath broken down Orthodox's bounds and now riots on the common of HypocrisyWith one eye he looks up to Heaven to make his congregation think he is devout that's his spiritual eye and with the other eye he looks down to see what he can get and that's his carnal eye and thus with locks flowing down his face he says or seems to say or at least with your permission we'll at∣tempt to say for him  Bretheren Bretheren Bretheren The word bretheren comes from the Tabernacle because we all may breathe thereinIf ye want rouzing I'll rouze you I'll beat a tattoo upon the parchment cases of your consciences and whip the Devil about like a whirlagigEven as the cat upon the top of the house doth squall out even so from the top of my voice will I bawl out and the organ pipes of my lungs shall play a voluntary among ye and the sweet words that I shall utter shall sugar candy over your souls and make car∣raway comfirts of your consciencesDo you know how many taylors make a manWhy nineNine taylors make a man And how many make half a manWhy four journeymen and a 'prenticeEven so have you all been bound 'prentice to Mis∣solly the Fashion maker and now you are out of your times you have set up for yourselvesMy great bowells and my small guts groan for youI have got the gripe of compassion and the bellyach of pityGive me a dramDo give me a dram A dram of patience I mean while I explain unto you what reformation and what abomination mean which the worldly wicked have mixed together like potatoes and buttermilk and therewith made a sinful stiraboutReformation is like the comely froth at the top of a tankard of porterand Abomination is like the dregs at the bottom of the tap tubHave you carried your consciences to the scowerers lately Have you bought any ful∣lers earth at my shop to take the stains outYou say yes you have you have you haveBut I say no you lye you lye I am no velvet mouth preacher I scorn your lawn sleeve languageYou are all full of filth ye must be boil'd down in our Tabernacle to make portable soup for the saints to sup a ladle∣ful of and then the scum and the sealdings of your iniquites will boil over and that is called the kitchen stuff of your consciences that serves to grease the cartwheels that carry us over the Devil's ditch and the Devil's gapThe Devil's ditch that's among the jockeys at Newmarket and the Devil's gap that's among the other jockeys the lawyern in Lincoln's inn fieldsAnd then there is the Devil among the Taylors and the Devil among the Players the Players they play the Devil to payThe playhouse is Satan's ground where women stretch themselves out upon the tenterhooks of temptationTragedy is the blank verse of Beelze∣bubComedy is his hasty pudding andPantomime is the  Devil's country danceAnd yet you'll pay the players for see∣ing plays yes yes but you won't pay me no no till Beelze∣bub's bum bailiffs lay hold of you and then you think I'll pay your garnish but I won't No you shall lay on the common side of the world like a toad in a hole that is bak'd for the Devil's dinnerDo put some money in the platePut some money in the plateand then all your iniquities shall be scalded away even as they scald the bristles off the hog's back and you shall be cleansed from all your sins as easily as the barber shaveth away the weekly beard from the chin of the ungodly  Do put some money in the plate  Or I your preacher cannot eat  And 'tis with grief of heart I tell ye  How much this preaching scow'rs the belly  How pinching to the human tripe  Is piteous bellyach and gripe  But that Religion lovely maid  Keeps a cook's shop to feed the trade  The motives of our deeds the same  With WI put in my claim  The pious thieves attack your purses  With cries and tears and pray'rs and curses  But I more modest in the trade  Dare never damn the fools I've made  But will if so your worships please  In future times on bended knees  Say sing and swear that those alone are right  Who crowd this tabernacle every night  FINIS  References to the HEADS in the Plate  I
