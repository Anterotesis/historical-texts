 THE DANGER OF THE  Protestant Religion  CONSIDER'D FROM THE PRESENT PROSPECT OF A Religious War in  Europe  LONDON  Printed in the Year  To the KING  SIR  'TIS not the Meanest of Your Trophies and of which Mankind speaks in Your Praise that both Your Majesty and Your Ancestors have always been the Champions of Liberty and the Great Defenders and Protectors of the Protestant Religion  As such this whole Nation made their Addresses to You when they stood in need of a Deliverer from the Encroachments of  Popish  Powers and Councils  As such they receiv'd Your Majesty in the room of those who chose rather to Desert them than to see them a Free Protestant People and as such they committed to Your Majesty's Government and Protection the Safety of their Religion and Liberties which by Your Assistance they had recovered from the Invasions of  Popery  and as such the Author of these Sheets humbly Addresses them to Your Majesty  The  Protestant Religion  seems to stretch forth her Hands to Your Majesty as to her Constant Protector You may view her in a Posture of Trembling at the Formidable Prospect of her Encreasing Enemies and pointing to the Confederacies that are making against Her  Providence and the Crown You wear claims Your Majesty's Concern for the Defence of Religion  The Peace of  Europe  the Preservation of Trade the Leagues and Alliances made by Reasons of State and for Interests of Government are Things of Consequence to Kings and Nations and Your Majesty is justly Concern'd about them  The Liberties of this Nation the Property of the Subject the Encrease of Manufactures and the Maintenance of the  Poor are Things worthy of Debates in the Great Council of the Nation the  Parliament  But these are all Antecedent to the Great Relative  Religion  These are all but Circumstances to the Great Essential Circles drawn about the Great Center  Religion  Religion  is or ought to be the Great Concern of Kings and Nations 'Tis for this Kings reign and Parliaments assemble Laws are enacted Trade is carried on Manufactures are improv'd Men born and the World made  Your Majesty is a proper Judge Whether the Danger of Religion in  Europe  represented in these Sheets be real or not And the Author freely Appeals to Your Majesty for the Truth of it  If it be real God and the Protestant Religion calls aloud on Your Majesty and the whole Nation That laying aside the Debates of other meaner Affairs the whole Strength and Soul of the Kingdom should be applied to and concern'd about the Care and Preservation of that Inestimable Treasure  Nor may the Trifles of Property or Prerogative or any thing else of how great Consequence soever have so much as room in the solemn Consultations of the Nation till this Great Affair is settled and so secur'd that the Power of  Popery  and  Superstition  may be incapable to hurt it  We know that the Almighty Power from whom all Human Strength is deriv'd is able to preserve the  Protestant Religion  and that without even Your Majesty or Your Parliament's Assistance  But as He always works by Means and Instruments and has always own'd Your Majesty as an Instrument in his Hands for this Glorious Work so Your Majesty is desir'd to reflect that it wou'd be a Singular Mark of Heaven's Displeasure if for want of a Continued Regard to the Security of that Religion which God has entrusted Your Majesty and this Nation with the Protection of He shou'd be oblig'd to re assume the Special and Immediate Care of it Himself and take the Work out of our Hands  THE DANGER OF THE Protestant Religion FROM THE Present Prospect of a Religious War in EUROPE  UPON the Present strange Circumstances of Affairs in  Europe  Occasion'd by the Succession of a Prince of  France  to the Crown of  Spain  People are mightily concern'd as their several Thoughts and Interests guide them  Some and reason good apprehend  England  especially will come under many Disadvantages with respect to Trade both in the  Straights  and in  America  where the  French  will always have Assistance from the  Spanish  Power to encroach upon Our Trade have the Preference in their Ports and Markets and several other things which I cou'd enlarge on as well as another  Some apprehend the Growth of the  French  Power at Sea his Dangerous Neighbourhood and his Encroaching Humour which they give melancholy Instances of in all the late Wars Particularly in which 'tis needless here to repeat  But I do not yet find any Concern express'd or any Danger fear'd for the Protestant Religion Methinks 'tis too certain a Token the Care of it does not lye next our hearts  We are allarm'd at every step made by our Powerful Neighbours to the Detriment of our Politick Interest We can see Dangers to our Trade and Shipping at the Distance of an Age or two form Leagues whether right or wrong commence Treaties settle Alliances and join in Confederacies and Guarranties for the Preservation of the Ballance of Power and Trade  But since Answering of Questions is become the Subject and some are pleas'd to Answer them before they are ask'd give a poor Pamphleteer or Scribler or any thing what you please to call him leave to ask one Question  Where is the League or Alliance in  Europe  made or propos'd to be made for the Preservation and Defence of the Protestant Religion  The Concern of  Religion  is not the meanest Article in the Peace of  Europe  I am not going to preach a Lecture of Divinity to show the Value of Religion and how near the Thoughts of it ought to lye upon our Minds I wou'd have so much Charity as to believe every  English  Protestant has a just Concern for the Prosperity as well as the Security of his Religion  But possibly every Man that does value his Religion may not be sensible of the Danger it is in and therefore it may not be amiss to examine the State of the Protestant Religion as it now stands in  Europe  with respect to its own Power and the Power of its Enemies  In order to which Scrutiny 'tis necessary to go back a little to the Original of the present Settlement on which we stand  The Protestant Religion has been profess'd in almost all the Dominions of  Europe Spain  and  Italy  excepted and in most of those Countries where it has obtain'd on the Inhabitants it has been Establish'd by Leagues and Treaties which Establishments have generally been the Effect of bloody Wars the Liberty the Protestants enjoy has next to God's Goodness been the Purchase of the Sword at the Price of the Blood and Treasure of the People  For the better understanding the present Condition of the Protestants in  Europe  I shall Divide them into several Heads of Nations and Discourse of them apart bringing their short History down to the present Time  First  the Princes of Germany  I place them first because they were the first that stood up for the Defence of Religion the Chief of these are the Kings of  Sweden  and  Denmark  the Dukes of  Brandenburgh Saxony  and  Lunenburgh Hanover Hess Cassel Zell  with a Multitude of smaller Princes States and Cities  These maintain'd a long and bloody War with the Emperor  Charles  the Fifth who reduc'd them to low Circumstances but by the Assistance of  Henry  the Second King of  France  their Religion receiv'd the first Security by Treaty at the Peace of  Passau  in the Year and was afterwards Establish'd at the Diet at  Augsburgh Anno  But in the Year the War was renew'd again by the Emperor  Ferdinand  the Second who by the hand of his Old General  Tilly  brought the whole Protestant Interest in  Germany  to the Brink of Ruin  The  Bohemians  were ruin'd at the Battel of  Prague  the Palatinate given to the Duke of  Bavaria  the Circle of the Lower  Saxony  overrun by  Tilly  and the King of  Denmark  who headed the Protestants overthrown at the Battel of  KingsLutter  the Dukes of  Mecklenburgh Pomeren  Bishopricks of  Bremen  and  Halberstadt  the Countries of  Slesia Lusatia  and innumerable others seized and in the Emperor's possession and the Victorious  Tilly  trampled down Religion with the Fury of a True Son of  Rome  The Protestants in this Distress as we did lately here in a like Case fly to a Neighbouring Prince for Protection  Gustavus Adolphus  King of  Sweden  a King who perhaps never had a Parallel till now came to their Assistance with only Twelve thousand Men he Landed at  Straelsundt  took all the Dutchies of  Pomeren  and  Mecklenburgh  secur'd the Duke of  Brandenburgh  's Country and enters  Saxony  just as  Tilly  had resolv'd to ruin it  Tilly  meets him with an Army of Fortyfour Thousand Old Soldiers is overthrown and his Troops entirely ruin'd at the Battel of  Leipsick  God whose Instrument this Gallant King more particularly was carried him on with such a Prodigious Course of Victory that in Two years he overrun two Third parts of the Empire settled all the Protestant Princes free and uninterrupted in the Possession of their Liberties and Religion  And though he lost his Life at the famous Battel of  Lutzen  though his Party was afterwards basely forsaken by the Duke of  Saxony  who had been twice sav'd from  ruin by them though the  Swedes  were routed at the Battel of  Nordlingen  yet they carried the War on with success 'till they reduc'd the Emperor to demand a Peace in which the Liberty and Religion of  Germany  was entirely setled on the Foot whereon it now stands This is that famous Treaty of  Westphalia  made in the Year and which the  Protestants  of the  Palatinate  now complain is broken by this Peace care was taken as it should be in all Leagues of Religion first and of Property afterward the Liberty of the  Protestant  Religion in  Germany  has its being here and the King of  France  and  Sweden  are Guarrantees of the Treaty  The next general Clause of  Protestants  in my account shall be the  Hugonots  of  France  these had long struggled with faithless Kings had vigorously supported themselves in Eight Civil Wars under the conduct of  Gaspar Coligni  Admiral of  France  two Princes of  Condè  and the King of  Navar  The little Honour the  Papists  shew'd them in their Treaties and the many Surprizes and Massacres they met with when under the protection of the Publick Faith kept the Sword always in their hand till at last a Breach between  Hen  the III and the House of  Guise  forced that Prince though he had used them very ill before to throw himself into their Hands for protection but being stabb'd by  James Clement  a  Jacobine Fryar  he fell a Sacrifice to the fury of the  Guises  and the Crown devolv'd to the King of  Navar Henry  the IV the Head of the Protestants which King though he chang'd his Religion to secure the Crown yet so far he took care of the Protestant Interest as to secure them in the free exercise of their Religion by the famous  Edict  of  Nants  which how it has been observ'd you shall hear presently  The  Dutch  are the next in course These being Subjects of the King of  Spain  but having embrac'd the Protestant Religion were most cruelly treated by the several Governors sent from the Court of  Madrid  and as Oppression is the first Motive to Complaint they made their frequent Application to the King of  Spain  for redress of their Grievances who answer'd them as  Rehoboam  did the  Israelites  and to make his Words good sent them  Ferdinand de Toledo  Duke  D' Alva  for their Governor who boasted that he had Executed Eighteen thousand of them by the hand of the Hangman Which bloody Proceeding together with the Approach of the  Spanish  Inquisition which he was resolv'd to introduce drove the People to the last Extremity  viz  To use Force in the Defence of their Natural Rights Lives and Religion A Doctrine which however it may be cried down by our Modern Politicians has obtain'd upon the whole World and been more or less practised by all Nations at one time or other  This War begun by the Prince of  Orange  the famous Predecessor of our present King was carried on with various success and the Union of the Seven Provinces which we now call the States of  Holland  was form'd headed and protected by him 'till he was murther'd by  Balthazar Gerrard  at the procurement of the  Spaniards  being shot with two Bullets through the Body as he was going from Dinner into a Withdrawing Room in his Palace at  Delft  His Successor Prince  Maurice  carried on the War with better success for almost Forty Years and at last reduced the  Spanish  Power so low that they rather sued for Peace than granted it which Peace was the known Treaty of  Munster  at which the  Spaniard  renounc'd the Sovereignty of the United Provinces and declar'd them a Free State as they are this day  England Scotland  and  Ireland  is another Class The Reformation obtain'd here with less difficulty and has continued from the beginning of Queen  Elizabeth  without such Opposition and Interruption as it met with abroad  Let us now consider these Four Classes under One General Head of Confederacy as they were engaged in the late War and we shall presently put the whole in the general Ballance by which the meanest Understanding may make a judgment what is like to be the Condition of the  Protestant  Interest in  Europe  Almost all the  Protestants  of  Europe  the Two  Northern  Crowns who stood newter excepted were unanimously confederated in the last War against the Power of  France  and though the Emperor and  Spaniard  guided by Reasons of State join'd with them 'tis plain to all the World what difficulty the Confederates had what Blood what Treasure was expended to reduce the  French  to the Terms of an Honourable Peace  If we re examine the Present State of  Europe  we shall find it as to the Interest of Religion in worse Circumstances on several Accounts than it ever yet was since the Treaties of  Munster  and  Westphalia  First The  Saxon  one of the most Considerable Princes of  Germany  and formerly the great Barrier of the  Protestant  Religion on that side is to be counted lost their Duke turn'd  Papist  to get a Crown hardly worth keeping a close Confederate with the Emperor and dependant upon him for his support in his new gotten Kingdom  The Electorate though it remains  Protestant  is beggar'd and exhausted to maintain their Prince in his New Throne their Forces absent and which is worse already employ'd in an Unjust and Dishonourable War with a  Protestant  Prince in defiance of Leagues unbroken  and begun on frivolous pitiful Pretences and like to be carried on to the ruin of its Author  The Palatinate another  Protestant  Electorate by the Succession of the House of  Newburgh  is fallen into the hands of the  Papists  and now in the Power of a Prince who in confidence of a support from the Emperor his Brother in Law is making the first open Infractions into the Treaty of  Westphalia  and persecutes his  Protestant  Subjects with all the rigor and cruelty of a Bigotted Prince who thinks he thereby does God good service and expects to be well paid for it  The  Protestants  of  Bohemia  and  Hungary  are both remote and both absolutely crush'd under the weight of the Imperial Rigor  The  Protestants  of  France  who I rank'd in the second Class and were once a powerful Branch are quite lost sunk and gone either supprest and driven to  Popery  at home in defiance of the  Edict of Nants  or like the Ten Tribes of  Israel  scatter'd abroad into so many unknown Countreys that they have lost themselves and in one Age more will be quite sunk out of Name and Memory  England  was at the brink of Ruin and the Foundation of the  Protestant  Religion stood absolutely undermin'd the Devil like  Guy Fauks  in the GunpowderPolt standing with the Dark Lanthorn and Match in his hand till the people took such a Fright as put the Nation into Fits of which they could never be cur'd till they had spewed out that Generation of Vipers that would have betrayed their Religion to the  Pope  and their Country to the  French  God and the Prince of  Orange  the one as Author the other as Instrument help'd us out and I say without flattery No Man can have a sense of the Goodness of the First and have no Gratitude for the Goodwill of  the Last And 'tis a just Cause of Wonder to consider what sort of Protestants they are who have forgot the condition the Protestant Religion was in at the first coming over of our present King and I would be glad to hear a  Jacobite Protestant  if such a Heterogeneous thing can be answer me this Question  How any  English Protestant  without mortgaging his Senses and Religion can so much as wish either that King  James  should have continued King or should return to be King in the same Temper Power and other Circumstances as he was in when his Present Majesty was invited over  Thus we see several considerable Branches of the Protestant Power quite Lost  The  Swede  who is one of the most Potent Princes in  Europe  in the part of the World where he is particularly useful we find his hands full with two faithless Neighbours and the flame of a War broke out which if he be not timely assisted may burn him out of  Germany  He is a young King though by what appears likely to come behind none of his most Glorious Ancestors and we have seen one Snare laid for him already which if the  English  and  Dutch  had not untied would have entangl'd him sufficiently however as he is there can but small help be obtain'd from him for the general safety of the Protestant Religion who is now suing at the Courts of his Allies for Aid against the  Pole  and the  Muscovite  It were to be wish'd the Protestants of  England  would agree to give such speedy and powerful assistance to the  Swede  in this juncture as may effectually free him from both his Assailants and put him into a posture to enter into a general Alliance for the defence of Religion if there should be occasion  There are some other Circumstances which weaken the Protestant Interest and that is the Temper of the  Danes  whose King seems disobliged in the highest manner against the  English Dutch  and  Swedes  and some have said how true I do not determine not very zealous for the Protestant ReligionAt least no great matters are to be relied on from him in case such a War should break out unless you will suppose him to be first thoroughly reconciled to those three foremention'd Powers  Whether the Business of making the Elector of  Brandenburgh  King of  Prussia  and the Duke of  Hannover  Elector of  Brunswick  may not cool the Zeal of those Princes in favour of the Emperor I shall not determine  Upon the whole it appears that the whole strength of the Protestant Power in  Europe  lies now upon the  English  and  Dutch  and the  German  Princes in the Circles of  Suabia  and the Lower  Saxony  I shall next examine the growth and power of  Popery  which plac'd in a just Balance with the rest will need but a short Inference to shew any rational man the disproportion of power that lies between them  The Popish Powers of  Europe  are as follow  The  French  a whole and entire Monarchy undivided at home and free from the incumbrance of  Protestants  among them who had several times in former Wars either byas'd their Power in favour of the  Protestants  as in the Reign of  Henry  the II or diverted their Designs by Civil Wars at home as in the days of  Lewis  the XIII But the present King of  France  having not broken the  Edict of Nants  only but abolished it has entirely broke the Body of the  Hugonot  Party and rooted the very name of it out of his Kingdom so that the  French  Power being  altogether  Popish  and united under the greatest King  France  ever saw may justly stand foremost as the First Champion of  Popery  in  Europe  I shall not enlarge here on the formidable Power of  France  how he has shown himself a Match for the greatest part of  Europe  nor upon the zeal and fiery rage of the  French  King against the  Protestant  Religion they are things so known in  Europe  that it is needless to add any thing to our Apprehensions that way Let the  French Protestants  who are scatter'd over the face of all  Christendom  be a daily Memorandum to us on that Head  The Emperor though he be the first Prince in  Europe  I place next to the  French  because I think him something inferior in power to  France  at this time especially in the Circumstances we now are treating of disjointed from the  Protestant  part of the Empire  By the Emperor here we are to understand the Emperor and the  Popish  part of the Empire which may thus be enumerated  The Emperor the King of  Hungary  and  Bohemia  the Elector Duke of  Bavaria  a warlike and powerful Prince and always a Champion of  Popery  the Elector  Palatine  the Electors of  Ments Trier  and  Cologn  with the Bishop of  Munster  and some smaller  Popish  Princes of the Empire  The Third Head of Power on the  Popish  side is the  Spaniard  under which Name I comprehend all the Princes and Powers of  Italy  with the  Pope  the Grand Image of Antichrist the Duke of  Savoy  the King of  Portugal  and the Provinces of  Flanders  I have purposely omitted here the  Swiss  and  Grisons  because being some  Popish  some  Protestant  and lying out of the way they can neither add nor diminish in the case in hand but will be hired on both sides as the Parties  find occasion for them or can spare Money to pay for them  It might seem needless to make any Remarks here on the Powers on one side and the other those who are acquainted but in a tolerable measure with the present State of  Europe  must be convinc'd of this just consequence That there is no manner of Comparison to be made  But since our Saviour directs those who go out to War to consider whatever they are able with their Ten Thousand to encounter the Twenty Thousands of their Enemies let us recollect the Debate and consider the case if it were now coming to a War  I'll allow that the  Protestants  on every side were firmly leagu'd together by their own Interest for their general preservation and that all private Divisions petty Disputes and Quarrels among themselves were at least laid aside for the present till the Common Danger was over which if it be not true I wish it were  I must suppose also that which I think there is too much reason to fear that the  Popish  Powers before mentioned whether ally'd or no should join in a Common Design to suppress their  Protestant  Neighbours and whether jointly or separately it matters not much should fall upon those which lay next them  Having rang'd the Powers of either Party 'tis necessary to declare the posture of such a War in case it should ever come to pass  If ever the  Popish  Powers of  Europe  should enter into a Confederacy to attack the  Protestants  it would be thus  The  Dutch  would be fallen upon by the  French  on one side and the  Spanish  Netherlands being in the hands of the  Papists  the Barrier of  Flanders  is lost by which means the War is brought home to their own Doors  and the first Shock must fall on their Frontiers where they must defend themselves against the  Spaniards  on the side of  Sluice Bergen Op Zoom Breda  and the  Bosch  against the  French  on the  Maes  and the  Rhine  from  Maestricht  to  Nimeguen  and against the  Munsterians  on the Frontiers of  Groninghen  to the side of  Embden  and the Sea  Nor wou'd their Fleet stand them in any stead the War wou'd be all by Land They must maintain Three Royal Armies at least to keep the Field or their Enemies will break into their Country and make them maintain both Armies in a place  The  Dutch  are not insensible of the Truth of this as may be plainly prov'd by the Care and vast Expence they have been at to protect  Flanders  in all the last War from which all the Benefit they have propos'd to themselves has been the Maintaining a good Barrier between Them and  France  and thereby keeping the War from their own Country  The  German  War will in all probability be on the Banks of the  Elb  the  Oder  and the  Main  The Protestant Countries lye from the  Oder  to the  Rhine  and contain the whole Circles of the Upper and the Lower  Saxony  and a small part of the Circles of  Westphalia Franconia  and  Suabia  But the Weight of the War on the Protestants must lye on the  Elb  and the  Main  On the  Elb  the  Imperialists  will have their main Forces to Attack the Dukes of  Brandenburgh  and the Princes of the House of  Lunenburg  and on the  Main  the  Hessian  with the Princes of the Lower  Saxony  will be Attackt by the Duke of  Bavaria  the Prince  Palatine  and the Electors of  Treves Mentz  and  Cologn  backt still by the Emperor the  French  and the  Spaniards  The  Swedes  and  Brandenburghers  will again have the Emperor on their backs upon the  Oder  with the  Poles  to assist him  Here if ever such a Time shall happen the War will be very bloody and were not the  French  to join on the Banks of the  Main  perhaps the Emperor might have his hands full But a  French  Army to fall in among the Princes of the Circles of  Franconia  and  Westphalia  is an Article not to be consider'd without giving up the Cause  Nothing but the Angel of God in the Army of  Senacherib  can prevent their Total Destruction  I foresee I shall be attackt by a sort of Men who are Carrying on Designs of their own and think every Man aims at them with Arguments like these  This is Discovering the Weakness of the Protestants and leading their Enemies by the hand to destroy them betraying our Friends or exposing them Or  This is frighting the World with Chimera's of our own brain which perhaps may never come to pass Dangers as likely as that the  Turks  may Overrun  Christendom  and Extirpate the whole Christian Religion Things to come to pass  when the Sky shall fall  This is another Shift to bring  England  to a Necessity of a StandingArmy which some people mightily want to subject her Liberty to the Arbitrary Designs of her Enemies  For the First I answer 'Tis no Discovery at all and they that will make such an Objection must suppose the Popish Princes of  Europe  very dull if they do not know it as well as we  But to make my Answer as short as the Question They who please to inform themselves will find that in the several Audiences of the  French  Ambassadors at  Rome  his Holiness gave the most Christian King several Exhortations to restore Peace to the Church which we find explain'd at  Paris  in the Speeches made to the King of  France  by the Pope's Nuncio where he Exhorts him again to Peace with the  Spaniards  that their United Arms might be employ'd  in the Extirpation of Heresy  If I shou'd need Arguments to convince Men that the  French  know as well as we the Power of the Protestant Princes I cou'd refer them to a late  French  Pamphlet printed at  Paris  and Re printed at  Rome  Entituled  La Crusade  which laments the Catholick Princes tearing out the Bowels of their Mother the Church and Exhorts them very passionately to employ their Victorious Arms to the Extirpation of Heresy and the Destruction of the Enemies of God and the Blessed Virgin  As to the Improbability of the matter and its being a Chimera  c  First Gentlemen it is no such Improbable thing neither for  what has been may be Charles  the Fifth undertook it singlehanded against all the Protestants in his time and though the  French  Opposed him he went a great way with the Work for he reduc'd them to such low Terms that had not the Treaty at  Passau  been obtain'd by the Power of  France  the Protestant Religion had been totally suppress'd in  Germany  Secondly The  French  have absolutely Effected it upon one of the most Considerable Branches of Protestants and thereby shown us a Test of their Good will to the whole and given an Instance of the possibility of the practice  Thirdly The Protestant Power was never in weaker Circumstances nor the Popish in stronger if they shou'd but Unite So that I must own if they do not attempt it they slip a manifest Opportunity and must be counted Fools too which by the way we never found them to be  As to  England  StandingArmies Liberty Arbitrary Power and the like I must crave leave to say a little I have no mind to meddle with the Disputes of Politicians nor know nothing of those who have Designs either way  They that wou'd Enslave our Liberty by StandingArmies and they that wou'd leave us naked to our Enemies or put us out of a Posture to help our Friends are equally Enemies to the Protestant Religion  They that wou'd make our Kings out of Love with their Protestant Subjects or our People jealous of a Protestant King are  Beautefeus  of their native Country and want to see her again involv'd in Blood that she may not be able to protect or defend the Protestant Religion  They who wou'd advance the Prerogative of Kings to the Ruin of the Subjects Properties and They who wou'd subdue the  English  Monarchy and the Just Power of the King to the Will and Pleasure of a Party equally drive at the Destruction of Our Constitution and in that of the Protestant Religion  'Tis not Arbitrary Power which is the present Case nor StandingArmies nor Liberty nor Property but the Protestant Religion Let  England  have a care she does not take so much Care of her Liberties as to forget her Religion But let us so see the one done as not to leave the other undone  In Reading some late Pamphlets  Pro  and  Con  about the Danger of Trade and the Power of our Enemies I  observe some are for maintaining Confederacies with Foreign States and Alliances with Neighbours and some are against it  Truly Gentlemen in the Case I am Treating I Rank all the Powers of  Europe  into two Classes only  Papist  and  Protestant  And we are supposing the Popish Powers shou'd link themselves together in a Confederacy for the Extirpation of Protestants whom they call  Hereticks  let any Rational Man make the Consequence What shou'd Protestants do Can any human Methods preserve them but a strict Union among themselves to join in their mutual Defence  I know better than to reflect on Parliaments But if a Parliament of Protestants forgets the Safety of the Protestant Religion they neglect the chief Work they assemble about  Trade Liberty Property Right and Wrong Justice and Equity are Things the Convocated Assemblies of the People are call'd together about and they are in the right but these are but the subservient Preliminaries to preserve a State or Country in Peace that they may with their joint Force resolve and be able to defend and secure their Religion  The Protestant Religion is the Fundamental of the  English  Constitution and I hardly ever remember the Assembling a Parliament in  England  but they had their Grand Committee for Religion What those Committees have done of late towards the propagating or securing Religion is best known to them who can search the Journals of the House nor is it proper for me to examine  I am not for prescribing Methods how the Protestant Religion is to be Defended but I crave leave to give some Hints from the present Circumstances of Affairs to awaken Protestants that they may see their Religion is  aim'd at by the Popish Powers of  Europe  a weak Politician may foresee That if ever a Union shou'd happen between the  French Spaniards  and  Germans  all the Protestants of  Europe  except us are lost and undone unless some wonderful Revolution which a wiser Head than mine cannot foretel shou'd happen  Wherefore I desire only of Parliaments of Protestants and Kings that they wou'd condescend so far as to take the poor Distressed Protestant Religion into their Care  Let it be by such Ways and Means as to their Honour in their Great Wisdom shall seem meet  If it may be done without StandingArmies or Confederacies abroad with all our hearts If the Walls of  Jericho  will fall down at the Sounding of Ramshorns never let us raise Batteries or plant Cannon against them  Here is no room to talk of Pretences and Shooinghorns for StandingArmies God and the Protestant Religion calls upon all the Professors of it in  Europe  to look to themselves and to stand up  for the City of our God  And if the Enemies of the Church of Christ say  A Confederacy  they are to give the Curse of God on all those who shall refuse  to help the Lord against the Mighty  In this Case a War of Religion will require us to lay aside all our illnatur'd Animosities Here is no Foreigners no Refugees no  Dutch  Men 'Tis a  Protestant  is the General Term as in Two Armies that are to Engage where One Party wears a White and the Other a Green Signal in their Hats they do not enquire what Nation any Man is of but if any of the White Party meets a Souldier with the Green in his Hat  Down with him  if they see another with the White in his Hat in Distress  Relieve him  is  the word  In this Cause of Religion Gentlemen if the  Swede  or the  Dane  or the most remote Nation be Attackt we are only to examine if the Protestant Religion be his Signal  if so we ought to help and relieve them let them be what Nation or People soever and let Natural and Political Aversions be never so great if our Enemy's house be on fire we'll endeavour to put it out if it be for nothing else but for fear it shou'd burn our own When the Protestants in any part of  Europe  are Attackt  Proximus Ardet  Let us consider if ever the Fire of Popery consumes the Protestant Powers of  Europe  the Flame will certainly catch hold of us in  England  Some Gentlemen have said lately That Confederacies and Alliances never are of any Advantage to  England  because we live by our selves in an Island and have a good Fleet  I shall not examine whether what they say will hold in Matters of Policy and Government But Gentlemen let me tell you If the  English  Nation shou'd see the Rest of the Protestants of  Europe  destroy'd without helping them even with all her Forces upon this principle That we are safe having a good Fleet shou'd we not expect besides all the other fatal ill Consequences our Saviour shou'd rank us among those who  when he was an hungry gave him no meat  or when he was in Distress gave him no help  which is all one  But because I wou'd a little prescribe in the Case too and come to Answering Questions as well as other people I shall enquire What  England  ought to do  I Answer  Principiis obsta  prevent the Conjunction of Popish Powers crush the Leagues and Confederacies of Popish Princes in the beginnings of them and by all possible Methods keep them from such a Union as is here supposed to be aim'd at  This is the way to take away the Cause that the Effect may vanish This takes away all shadow of designing a StandingArmy there will be no Occasion to Fight divide but the Interests of the Popish Powers of  Europe  if you can do so you certainly divide their Forces  The late War is a certain Demonstration that they will never unite against Religion if they cannot unite their Interests Whoever gives themselves leave to examine will plainly see 'tis Interest not Religion governs Princes I refer for it to the Answer the Emperor gave to King  James  when he demanded Assistance of him against King  William  When having told King  James  "That if he had rather hearkened to his friendly Remonstrances made him by the Imperial Ambassador the Count  de Kaunitz  than the Deceitful Insinuations of the  French  and if he had put a stop by Force to the many Breaches made by the  French  in the Treaty at  Nimeguen  of which he was Guarrantee and had entred into Consultations with the Imperial Court and their Confederates he might have quieted the Minds of his People and then enumerating the Cruelties of the  French  chiefly in the Catholick Countries exceeding the  Turks  themselves  the Emperor concludes  "That the Interest and Safety of the Empire is a sufficient Argument to justify his not assisting him on account of the  Popish  Religion against the  Protestants  having a  Papist  to Encounter with who on account of Interest and publick Safety ought in the first place to be Opposed and that for mutual Preservation and Defence he must be justified in taking Measures with all those meaning the  Protestants  who are concern'd in the same Design  Thus we see when joint Interest and Preservation is the Case even the  Popish  Princes themselves think it justifiable to join in Confederacies even with  Hereticks  to suppress an unjust Invasion of an encroaching Neighbour though a Catholick  From whence I draw this short Consequence  That if you keep the  Popish  Powers of  Europe  from Uniting their Interests you in effect keep them from Uniting their Forces and thereby from Invading the Protestant Religion  By preventing the Union of the  Popish  Powers possibly some may suppose I mean that  England  shou'd Engage in a New War with  France  to support the Title of the ArchDuke  Charles  to the Crown of  Spain  and there comes in the Old Story a StandingArmy again by head and shoulders  Why truly Gentlemen If ever we pretend to have a War whether it be with  France  or any body else we must certainly have an Army of our own or some bodies else or we shall make but sorry work on't  Whether those Gentlemen wou'd not chuse to see the Protestant Religion in  Europe  sunk and lost rather than see an Army raised in  England  I cannot conclude But this I am bold to affirm That they who had rather run the risque of the Protestant Religion than of their Liberties value their Freedom above their Religion and may very well be suspected to have no Religion at all  Now the Risque is not equal neither for we have had Armies in  England  and have lost our Liberties and we have had Armies in  England  and have not lost our Liberties The Difference lies here That we had Armies rais'd to Enslave us and they did it but the last were raised to Defend us and when that was done submitted the Military to the Civil Power and left our Liberties entire I wou'd say also but that I shall offend some folks That the grand Difference lay in the Kings we had  Some of our Kings design'd our Ruin and in a great measure compleated it by StandingArmies but a King that protects the Laws by a principle of Honour and Justice can make Armies that are so fatal to Liberty  be the protection of Liberty So that really it has been our Kings  of pious Memory  who have been Agents of the People's Ruin and the late War has shown the World that Armies may be rais'd and laid down again if Kings who Command them please but to say the word without ruining a Nation's Liberties  On the Other hand If Religion be attackt it must be defended or 'twill be lost  Thus far I have ventur'd to touch the nice Article of an Army in  England  I hope every  Englishman  will agree with me in this That I had rather see an Army in  England  and run the hazard of our Liberties than see the  Protestant  Religion in  Europe  trodden down for want of our helping to defend it  But these are General Points only  There are a great many Methods to be prescrib'd how the  Protestant  Religion may be Defended and yet no standing Forces raised or maintain'd in  England  and so our Liberties may not be in danger and the first is touch'd at already prevent the Union of  Popish  Powers and Interest and you'll need no fighting  Whether this may be done by giving powerful Assistances to the Emperor to carry on the Pretensions of the House of  Austria  or by appearing in the  Mediterranean  with a good Fleet to confirm the  Italian  Princes in the Interests of the Emperor or by sending over what Forces we have in  England  and  Ireland  to make a Diversion in Conjunction with the  Dutch  on the  Rhine  or in  Flanders  or by what other Ways or Means it may be done with or without an Army 'tis all one so it be but done that the  Protestant  Religion may be protected and the  Papists  prevented from Overturning us with a General destruction  But that no Man may have any shadow to suspect me guilty of a Design to Argue for a StandingArmy  which is  the great Bugbear of the Times  or at least made the  Watchword of a Party  that wou'd be thought to be more Zealous for our Liberty than any body else I'll put it on another point Our Neighbours may be so assisted by our Money as never to want our Men and so Gentlemen you will be try'd whether 'tis your Liberty or your Money that so much stir has been made about and if we shall let our Protestant Neighbours sink rather than part with our Money to support them then the Truth will come out  That 'tis our Money which was at the bottom of the matter  For really Religion and Liberty are so much in the same Interest that 'tis very seldom they Clash and he that shall refuse to defend his Religion for fear of his Liberty deserves to lose both  Thus we are got over the point that our Neighbours may be supported the Protestant Religion defended and the Union of the  Popish  Powers of  Europe  prevented by the  Protestants  at this time falling in to support the Emperor in his just Pretensions on the  Spanish  Dominions and all this without a StandingArmy in  England  Our Pamphleteers need not dispute about the Consistency or Inconsistency of an Army with the  English  Constitution nor whether they that are for or against it are the best Subjects I am sure he that has the greatest Concern for the Protestant Religion is most likely to be the best Christian They need not Entertain us with their Discourses of the Danger of our Liberties and Properties from a StandingArmy with their little Reflections on the King by way of Exclamations against the sad Consequences which may happen or may not happen They need not enter into the Histories of StandingArmies nor tell us the Wonderful Power of our most Formidable Militia But the Case will be alter'd when your  Protestant  Brethren call  for Assistance if you are afraid to trust Arms in the hands of your own Countrymen As  truly  Englishmen  are dangerous Fellows when in Arms very surly and loth to be Disbanded without their Pay  If therefore we do not think it safe to Trust our Own people never let us desert the  Protestant  Cause for  Germany  and  Swisserland  are Inexhaustible Storehouses of Men If you will but assist the  Protestants  with Money 'twill be the same thing or if we assist the Emperor at this time it may be the same thing for Prevention is all one as Execution or rather the better of the two  And this leads us to consider what with submission to better Judgments seems to me to be the only possible Means to prevent the Union between the  Popish  Powers of  Europe  and therein the Ruin of the  Protestants  I have said already Our way is to Crush the Confederacies of the  Papists  and if I do say that the Only way to do so is to prevent the Crown of  Spain  descending by Will to a Prince of the House of  Bourbon  and that Prince marrying a Daughter of the House of  Austria  I shall believe I am in the Right till I can hear a better method propos'd  This Union is much easier prevented than it will be dissolv'd Treaties and Alliances may disappoint it Now whereas Armies and Fleets will hardly defeat it afterward if the House of  Bourbon  and  Austria  Unite and Conform the Interests of their Dominions they can have no body to bend their Arms against but the  Protestants  or the  Mahometans  I see no War can be Rais'd in  Europe  but what will of Course run into a War of Religion For if the  Popish  Princes agree in Interests they can have nothing to quarrel about And to confirm this I appeal to a Review of the General History of  Europe  In which I offer to make it appear That setting aside the Quarrels  between the  French  and the  Spaniards  and between the  English  and the  Dutch  almost all the Wars of  Europe  have been Wars of Religion  And that I may not be thought to speak withoutbook I refer the Reader to Examine  The Wars in  Germany  which with some few Intermissions lasted from the Year to being Years and begun on pretence of Recovering the Lands of the Church sequester'd by the Duke of  Saxony  and ended by the Conquests of King  Gustavus  and his Generals at the Treaty of  Westphalia  in which War that Great Conquering King lost his Life and confirm'd what I am saying in his last Words which some Histories tell us were thus being wounded with a Carabinshot and ask'd by a  German  Trooper who he was Answer'd  I am the King of  Sweden  who do Seal the Religion and Liberty of the  German  Nation with my Blood  The Wars in the  LowCountries  begun with the  Spanish  Inquisition being Introduc'd into the  Netherlands  and Continued to the Peace of  Munster  with the Intermission of Twelve years Truce only and ended in the Liberty of the Protestant States being declar'd free by the King of  Spain  which War  Philip  the Second of  Spain  declar'd a little before his Death had cost him Millions of Ducats and the Expedition to Invade  England  Millions  The Civil Wars of  France  which began in the Reign of  Henry  the Second and Eight several Times engag'd the whole Kingdom and after that was carried on by  Henry  the Fourth against the  Guises  and the League backt by the whole Power of  Spain  on account of Religion and never had any long Cessation till the Edict of  Nants  and the Peace of  Vervins  I forbear to Instance any more being unwilling to enter into the Miseries of our Native Country but I think the Matter admits of no dispute That if the Union we speak of should ever come to pass there hardly  can Commence any War in  Europe  but what must be upon the account of Religion  Europe  has really nothing else to quarrel about or nothing but what Neighbours and Guarrantees can oblige one another to decide without a Rupture as lately it was in the Case of the  Dane  and the Duke of  Holstein  Religion is the only Dispute left What bloody Battels have been fought How has  Europe  been fill'd with Slaughter between those powerful Princes  Charles  the Fifth and  Francis  the First for the Kingdom of  Naples  for the Dutchy of  Savoy  and  Millan  and for the Frontiers of  Burgundy  and  Flanders  What incredible Expences and how many heaps of slaughter'd Carcasses has the Quarrels between the  French  and the  Imperialists  cost on the Banks of the  Rhine  and the  Moselle  and between the  French  and the  Spaniards  in our Age in  Catalonia  and  Flanders  These have been the Capital Wars of  Europe  and if the Union between  France  and  Spain  be compleated the Cause is remov'd and the Effects cease of Course There can be no War in this part of the World but what must Engage the  Protestants  unless the  Protestants  shou'd fall out among themselves which wou'd be worse still Hitherto the Wars between the  Popish  Powers has been the Safety of the  Protestants  if one potent Prince has Attackt them the Jealousy of another has Defended them The  Protestants  have from the very beginning been shelter'd and protected only by the Animosities and Jealousies maintain'd between the  French  and the House of  Austria  I cannot liken the Protestants of  Europe  to any thing more aptly than to the City of  Hamburgh  between the  Danes  and the Dukes of  Brandenburgh  and  Lunenburgh  or to the Duke of  Savoy  's Dominions between the  Spaniards French  and  Italians  If the City of  Hamburgh  had had but one of those Neighbours it had either been  no City at all  or  their City  long ago but the Jealousy and Misunderstanding  of those Princes is the Security of the  Hamburghers  Either the  French  or the  Spaniards  had long ago Annexed the Dutchy of  Savoy  to their Estates had the one been but willing to sit still and let the other Enjoy it  Charles  the Fifth had certainly subdued all the  Protestants  in the Empire if  Henry  the Second of  France  had not upheld them and that not from any kindness he had to them but that he was not Easy to see the Emperor be so Great Afterward the Emperor himself encourag'd the  Protestants  of  France  and suffer'd Men to be Levied in the Empire for the King of  Navarr  lest he being quite suppress'd the  French  shou'd be at leisure to quarrel with him Thus the Jealousies between the Powers of  France  and  Germany  have been the Security of the Protestant Religion in  Europe  Since that in our Memory the Emperor and King of  Spain  both  Papists  Declar'd War against  France  and Form'd the Tripple Alliance only to save the Protestant States of  Holland  from falling into the hands of the French  Anno  when our Protestant King  Charles  the d of pious Memory did his Utmost to Overthrow them and subject them to an Absolute  French  Conquest  If any man shall be so weak as to Reply in the Language of some late Pamphlets What's all this to us What does the Union of  Spain  and  Germany  or of any body else signify to us I crave leave to Answer such a Question by saying as our Saviour to the  Pharisees And I also will ask you a Question  What signifies the Protestant Religion to us  And if they will undertake to Answer the Last I will promise to Answer the First  I might go on here to give Instances how near the  Protestant  Religion has been to be suppress'd in  England  and what a just Concern other Nations have always had for its preservation  But setting that aside for we do not love to hear of it I desire only to remind the Reader That the Parliaments  of  England  together with our  Protestant  Kings and Queens have always express'd deep Resentments at the Danger of the  Protestant  Religion and of our  Protestant  Neighbours and have always thought it became them by Treaties and Intercessions to procure their Repose or by Money and Forces to assist them to defend themselves  And after giving some Instances I shall examine the Reasons of it and see if the same Reasons do not now call on us for the same Proceedings  Queen  Elizabeth  after she had provided for the Safety of Religion at home her next Care was to assist her  Protestant  Neighbours What vast Sums of Money did she Give and Lend what Number of Troops did she Raise to support the  Hugonots  in  France  and Prince  Maurice  in the  Netherlands  Even before she had any actual War with the  Spaniard  The Histories of those Times reckon up above  English  Soldiers including Volunteers that fought during that long War in the Quarrel of the  Protestant  Religion in the  LowCountries  where they behav'd themselves so well and gain'd such Reputation that Years afterwards when our Civil Wars broke out in  England  an Old  LowCountry  Soldier was always counted a Man of Value  Queen  Elizabeth  sent at several times Men to the Assistance of the  French Hugonots  under  Hen  the th  After the Death of Queen  Elezabeth  King  James  the First though he had not Courage enough to break with  Spain  in the just Quarrel of the  Palsgrave  King of  Bohemia  yet we find the  English  Nation and Parliament all along Resenting not so much the Injury of that Family as the Ruin of the  Protestants  of the  Palatinate  and several Bodies of Men were sent over to Count  Mansfield  to defend it though by the Craft of the  Spaniard  the  Scotish  King was Cajol'd into an easy Deserting the Cause both of the  Protestant  Religion and his own Family  In the Reign of K  Charles  the First what vast Sums  of Money were given by the Parliament to assist the  Protestants  of  Rochelle  which tho' by the Mis application of the Court and the Duke of  Buckingham  did them little service yet 'tis plain by it that the Parliament knew the Protection of our  Protestant  Neighbours was a Work the whole Nation had a just Concern in both on Civil as well as Religious Accounts  After this you have Men at a time twice raised besides Recruits and sent by Sea as far as  Pomerania  to assist the King of  Sweden  in the Quarrel of the  Protestants  in  Germany  In the Year the Parliament of  England  address'd K  Charles  the d to Enter into such Leagues and Alliances with our  Protestant  Neighbours as might effectually preserve  Flanders  from falling into the hands of the  French  and I refer to the Words of that Address where you have the whole People of  England  Remonstrating of what Consequence the preservation of  Flanders  was to the  English  Nation and which stands as an Invincible Argument against our Modern Politicians who are for no Leagues nor Confederacies nor Neghbours and think  England  a Match for all the World  These seem to be Instances enough and 'tis matter of Wonder to me what sort of Amphibious Neutral Creatures those  Protestants  are which shall ask what signifies the  Protestants  abroad to  England  Supposing there was no real Danger of our selves in the Case  Let us examine in the next place the Reasons which have all along induc'd the  English  Nation to assist their  Protestant  Neighbours and they are of two sorts  Reasons of Religion and Reasons of State  And I'll be very short with them both because they are touch'd at already  Reasons of Religion  are such as  Charity  which obliges the Strong to protect and defend the Weak when they are oppress'd and injur'd and unable to defend themselves The several Commands of our Saviour for the  Relief of such as are in Distress Illustrated by the Story of the Good  Samaritan  the Declaration which our Saviour has made That  whatsoever is done to the least of his is done unto himself  and shall be Rewarded accordingly and the like  Reasons of State  are principally the Great Doctrine of Selfpreservation which branches it self in such Methods as these  Keeping Danger at a distance  Keeping a good Barrier between Our selves and powerful Neighbours that you may not be forced to a Defensive War  Preventing the Union of Neighbours of different Interests from Our selves    dly  Preserving publick Peace which is best done  By strong Alliances and Guarrantees  By keeping an Equality of Parties or a General Balance of Power  And by being always in such a posture of Defence as to make it dangerous for a Neighbour to break with you  These with many others are the Reasons why our Princes and our Parliaments too have always thought it both their Duty and their Interest to protect and defend the  Protestant  Religion abroad and have always been very tender of the Injuries done them by their  Popish  Adversaries and resented them accordingly  I shall give one Instance more  I hope the Reason of State will not be lik'd the worse for the Statesman  and that was  Oliver Cromwell  who being sollicited by the Protestant  Vaudois  in  Savoy  used all his Interest to mediate with the Duke their Prince for a Relaxation of their Miseries and in his Letters both to the Duke and the  French  King after a great deal of fruitless Intercession threatens to turn all the  Roman Catholicks  out of  England  and  Ireland  and seize their Effects if some speedy Regard be not had to the Afflictions of the distressed Protestants I refer the  Reader for the Particulars to the  Latin  Copies of the Letters wrote on that Subject by his Secretary of Foreign Dispatches the Learned  Milton  in which there are Reasons given why the  English  Nation shou'd think themselves oblig'd to concern themselves in the Sufferings of the  Protestants  But methinks it shou'd be needless to go any farther than the Journals of our own Parliaments since the Restoration where it will evidently appear that  English  Parliaments have always had a deep Resentment at the Growth of  Popery  and the Danger of the Protestant Religion and there is no doubt but an  English  Parliament will ever maintain the same Sentiments  The Growth of  Popery  is certainly dangerous to the Protestant Religion They are the two Buckets in the Well the two Scales on the Beam of Power if One comes up the Other must go down if you add to the Weight of One it will lift the Other out of its place  Let all those who wou'd stand Neuter in this Cause of Religion remember that God Almighty has declar'd against such as are lukewarm Christians There is no Neuter Gender in Religion In the Cause of Religion They who are not for him are against him the Defence of the Protestant Religion calls upon all Men who have any Value for it to appear in the time of its Danger Defend Religion and Politick Interests will be easily secur'd  à jove Principium God and your Country  but first God and then your Country  In short though I am no Prophet nor the Son of a Prophet I think a man with but a small Talent of forcast may be able to foretel That if we are wanting to God in the due and vigorous defence of his Church and Worship which is in  English  the  Protestant  Religion his Providence has so wisely disposed the matter and made our Liberty so dependant on and relative to our Religion that it is morally impossible Liberty in  England  can be any longer liv'd than Religion  Popery  and Slavery  are like Sin and Death direct Consequences of one another and whenever we think fit to admit the first any body may promise us the last  The CONCLUSION  I Cannot conclude this matter without remembring two Exceptions that lie against any body's pleading the Cause of Religion  First That in all the ill practices of the World the Revolutions of States Rebellions of Subjects and Tyranny of Princes  Religion is the Mask  to hide the Deformity of the Monster conceal'd  Secondly That  God is Omnipotent  and the  Protestant  Religion is under his immediate protection that he is able to defend it without means and against probability  To the First I make answer in the words of the Prince of  Denmark  in the Letter he wrote to the late K  James  on his joining with the Prince of  Orange  our present King at his coming in to  England  That were not Religion the most justifiable Cause it would not be made the most specious Pretence  And to this Quotation I shall add You may as well argue against the Christian Church administring the Eucharist because  Hen  VII Emperor of  Germany  was poison'd by a Consecrated Host  As to the Second Argument 'Tis true God governs the World and in his governmen  of the World he has ordered that we should govern our selves by Reason God has subjected even the ways of his Providence to Rational Methods and Outward Means agree to it The great Chain of Causes and Effects is not interrupted even by God himself if it be it is on Extraordinary Occasions which we call Miracles  Now according to the Nature of Causes and Consequences the Argument for our care of Religion must be good as to those people who look for Miracles I have nothing to say to them  FINIS
