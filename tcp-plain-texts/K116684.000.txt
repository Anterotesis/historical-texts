 LEUCOTHOE A DRAMATIC POEM  Price One Shilling and SixPence  LEUCOTHOE A DRAMATIC POEM  In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas  Corpora  OVID Met lib i  Vulgo recitare timentis  HOR lib i sat  LONDON Printed for R and J DODSLEY in PallMall And Sold by M COOPER in PaternosterRow and A BROWN in the HayMarket  TO THE READER  WE are not to do evil that good may come of it else I might plead in favour of the following little poem that whatever its faults may be it was undertaken and pursued with a laudable design The ridiculousness not to say barbarity of turning SHAKESPEAR's plays into operas and larding them with songs from quite different authors as hath been lately practised upon our most justly approved theatre is I apprehend of so glaring a nature that every one who is endued with the smallest spark of taste must immediately be struck with it It is indeed the same thing as if any person should take it into  his head to reduce one of our antient Gothick cathedrals to a modern summerhouse and ornament it with designs from Halfpenny's Chinese architecture Such is the devastation and overturning such are the breaks and patches  There is no man in England I believe who has greater respect for a piece of beef  A thing to which Shakespear has been more than once compared  than I have but should I therefore like it cut into mince meat and mixed with my custard and applepie Certainly no the impropriety of the olio would then disgust me So do the vigorous lines of SHAKESPEAR when I meet them hashed up with Waller and Cowley in the luscious compositions of a musical entertainment  If we must have English operas somewhat of less value and at the same time better calculated for the end proposed might I thought be made use of But  many people will ask what occasion is there that we should have English operas at all Let any common lover of musick go but once to the King's theatre in the Haymarket and he will easily perceive that the Italian composition does and must with all its inconsistencies for ever excel any thing we can produce of the like nature and this not for want of abilities in our composers but thro' the insuperable disadvantages of our language Had I seen any of their musical dramas before I undertook this LEUCOTHÖE should never have been written but since it is done and cannot be recalled I hope I shall be pardoned if I am willing to try whether it may not be borne as a juvenile attempt at poetry tho' I have not been sollicitous to have it accompanied with the graces of that harmony for which it was originally intended  A French poetaster would have sent such a  petit piece  into the world with the  title of  Tragedie  but the Author of this hath not been long enough of the trade to acquire so much confidence Opera he must not call it because it should then end happily which the disposition of his fable would not admit of he therefore lets it go under the denomination of a DRAMATIC POEM But because it is save in that one instance of its catastrophe an opera he begs leave to subjoin what one of the first English poets hath written of that species of the drama which will be sufficient to shew that if he has failed in it it is what a greater genius might have done and if he has succeeded it is what the greatest genius has not been ashamed to think worthy of his accomplishing  "An opera says Mr DRYDEN in his preface to ALBION and ALBANUS is a poetical tale or fiction represented by vocal and instrumental musick adorned with scenes machines and dancing  The supposed persons of this musical drama are generally supernatural as gods and goddesses and heroes which at least are descended from them and are in due time to be adopted of their number The subject therefore being extended beyond the limits of human nature admits of that sort of marvellous which is rejected in other plays Human impossibilities are to be received as they are in faith because where the Gods are introduced a Supreme Power is understood and second causes are out of doorsIf the persons represented were to speak upon the stage it would follow of necessity that the expressions should be lofty figurative and majestical But the nature of an opera denies the frequent use of those poetical ornaments for vocal musick tho' it often admits a loftiness of sound yet always exacts an harmonious sweetness or to distinguish yet more justly  the recitative part of the opera requires a more masculine beauty of expression and sound the other which for want of a properer word I must call the songish part must abound in softness and variety of numbers its principal intention being to please the hearing rather than gratify the understanding"  He ends all after having given the preference to the Italian opera thus  "If I thought it convenient I could here discover some rules which I have given to myself in writing an opera in general and in this opera in particular but I consider that the effect would only be to have my own performance measured by the laws I gave and consequently set up little judges who not understanding thoroughly would be sure to fall upon the faults and not to acknowledge any of the beauties Here therefore if they will criticise they shall do it out of their own fund but let them be assured  that their ears are nice for there is neither writing nor judging on this subject without that good quality It is no easy matter in our language to make words so smooth and numbers so harmonious that they shall almost set themselves and yet there are rules for this in nature and as great a certainty and quantity in our syllables as either in the Greek or Latin But let poets and judges understand this first and then let them begin to study English When they have chewed a while upon these preliminaries it may be they will scarce adventure to tax me with want of thought and elevation of fancy in this work for they will soon be satisfied that those are not the nature of this sort of writing The necessity of double rhimes and ordering of the words and numbers for the sweetness of the voice are the main hinges on which an opera must move and both of these are without the compass of any art to  teach another to perform unless Nature in the first place has done her part by enduing the poet with nicety of hearing that the discord of sounds in words shall as much offend him as a seventh in music would a good composer I have therefore no need to make excuses for meanness of thought in many places The Italians with all the advantages of their language are continually forced on it or rather they affect it The chief secret is in the choice of words and by this choice I do not mean elegancy of expression but propriety of sound to be varied according to the nature of the subjectThe same reasons which depress thought in an opera have a stronger effect upon the words especially in our language for there is no maintaining the purity of English in short measures where the rhime returns so quick and is so often female or double rhime  which is not natural to our tongue because it consists too much of monosyllables and those too most commonly clogged with consonants for which reason I am often forced to coin new words revive some that are antiquated and botch others  ARGUMENT  LEUCOTHÖE daughter of ORCHAMUS King of Persia is beloved and secretly enjoyed by the SUN when CLYTIE a former mistress of his becomes acquainted with their amour and in the rage of jealousy makes a full discovery of it to the Lady's father ORCHAMUS as a punishment for his daughter's crime orders her to be buried alive which is accordingly executed in her lover's absence who coming too late to give her any assistance first changes her body into a tree of frankincense and then CLYTIE the cause of her misfortune into a statue  This is the chief subjectmatter of the following rhimes In OVID we are told that CLYTIE was metamorphosed into a sunflower but the Author hopes he need not make any apology for deviating from his original in that particular any more than for some other trifling circumstances which he has taken the liberty to vary and others which he has entirely omitted as foreign to his purpose  PERSONS  PHOEBUS  ORCHAMUS  King of Persia  LEUCOTHÖE  Daughter of  Orchamus  in love with and beloved by  Phoebus  CLYTIE  in love with  Phoebus  but slighted by him  A BLACK SLAVE  attending  Clytie  Chorus's Priests Youths Virgins and other Attendants  SCENE  PERSIA  LEUCOTHOE  ACT I  SCENE I  The theatre represents a plain bordered with wood several mountains which rise one above another till the highest seem lost in the clouds making the point of view at the farther end  CLYTIE  is discovered in a melancholy posture    _OH Jealousy thy torments who can bear  Forsaken scorn'd abandon'd to despair  I rage I burn no kind assistance nigh  Give give me ease ye gods or let me die  Farewel ye streams farewel ye groves  Farewel ye shady bow'rs  Soft scenes of blissful hours  Of former conscious loves  Farewel sweet peace of mind  Fond wishes pleasing pain  With all the tender train  The joy that happy lovers find  Farewel your halcyon days are o'er  And I must never know you more  The sun which appears in the midst of the sky moves slowly towards the summit of the mountains where opening by degrees it shews  Phoebus  in his chariot The horses are discovered and a great glory    But see he comes the author of my woes  He comes ungrateful Godbut not to me  Another love within his bosom glows  Another nymph distracting misery  Another nymph allures him to her arms  I cannot bear the thought confound her art  Eternal light'nings blast her charms  That robb'd me of the dear inconstant's heart  Goddess of dire Revenge may all her days  To peace be strangers and her nights to rest  May Hope ne'er sooth her with imagin'd ease  Nor Patience still the tumults in her breast  Since she has stoln possession of my joy  Fulfil my pray'r by pity justice led  May turns alike our happiness destroy  And all my griefs be doubled on her head  She retires among the trees  SCENE II  PHOEBUS  descends the mountain a symphony playing The machine sinks  " Hail to love delicious boy  " Hail to love and welcome joy"  Love the best the only treasure  Love that laughs at proud degree  Love that renders pain a pleasure  And by enslaving makes us free  When Heav'n to woman beauty did dispense  It gave away its own omnipotence  High 'mongst the pow'rs above enthron'd I sit  I'm stiled the God of Wisdom and of Wit  This arm alone Light's fiery steeds can rein  Oh force how impotent oh boast how vain  Incapable to curb my own desires  What's strength or wisdom's use when love inspires  Unseen resistless it impels us on  No force can tame it nor can prescience shun  And ere we dread the danger we're undone  SCENE III  PHOEBUS CLYTIE  Hah whence this boldness now who dares intrude  Upon my peaceful sacred solitude  CLYTIE  kneeling  Light of the world great eye and soul  View at your feet a suppliant maid  Behold my tears for you they roll  For you these sighs my breast invade  Ah turn your face ah cease to chide  Nor let while my distress you see  What's warmth and life to all beside  Be coldness and be death to me  PHOEBUS  Have I not told you CLYTIE o'er and o'er  That we must meet upon these terms no more  Why then persist you thus to haunt me still  And force me to be cruel 'gainst my will  CLYTIE  Because I love 'tis therefore I pursue  Oh need I say I love you know I do  That answer for me love in spite of fear  Brought me to meet your dread resentment here  The resolution of my doom to know  And dieif you unkind will have it so  PHOEBUS  Leave me and live  CLYTIE  Inhuman rather say  Oh ten times ratherCLYTIE Die and stay  To life with firmness I can bid adieu  But 'tis impossible to part from you  PHOEBUS  Be gone  CLYTIE  I cannotThere was once a time  When such a word would have been thought a crime  Oh change how great my person to behold  Am I deform'd or suddenly grown old  If ever I had charms your love to gain  Methinks those charms their wonted bloom retain  Say then in what in what is't I offend  Let me but know my fault I'll strive to mend  PHOEBUS  Would you my languid appetite revive  And keep the just expiring flames alive  Mild and reserv'd you should at distance stand  And gently feed it with a cautious hand  What sparingly applied renews desire  Pour'd on extinguishes and damps the fire  Give me the nymph who charms with ease  Whose greatest pleasure is to please  Whose passion ne'er tyrannic grows  But hand in hand with freedom goes  Who ne'er feels transport in her breast  But as she sees her lover blest  'Tis such a nymph and only she  Must hope to gain a heart from me  CLYTIE  And can you then so soon those vows forget  Which Eccho scarce has left repeating yet  Those vowsto me for ever fatal day  When first they led my easy faith astray  Which morns and eves have heard thou base ingrate  And promis'd love immortal as your state  Phoebus  traverses the stage she following    Think but how oft unmindful of alarms  You've lain encircled by those yielding arms  Insatiate draining copious draughts of bliss  And swearing heav'n was lodg'd in ev'ry kiss  And then when cloy'd with the delicious feast  And sunk unnerv'd on this still panting breast  Think now repeating the dear task you've dy'd  Yet cursed the day that forc'd you from my side  PHOEBUS  That once your beauties did my soul subdue  I frankly told you and I told you true  I lov'd enjoy'd and from enjoyment bless'd  Thought for a while my appetite encreas'd  But grown with frequent iteration tir'd  At length I nauseate what I first desir'd  CLYTIE  I see you nauseate ev'n this moment see  Your eyes regard me with antipathy  Nor think me stranger to the cause I know  What brings you PHOEBUS to this secret plain  For whom my gentle bondage you forego  And treat my love with insults and disdain  PHOEBUS  Hah  CLYTIE  For LEUCOTHÖe You start that name  Has struck you Oh more false than syren's song  Was it for this I sold myself to shame  For this  PHOEBUS  Be wise in time and stop your tongue  Another word's destruction sure as hell  Now hearken and take care t'observe me well  By that irrevocable oath I swear  Which even gods themselves with trembling take  By the eternal gloomy Flood if e'er  You breathe again what you've presum'd to speak  This instant life shall expiate the offence  Reply not make no answer get you hence  Oh where too charming cruel maid  Unmindful dost thou rove  Why is my bliss thus long delay'd  Haste haste thee quickly to my aid  And tune my jarring soul to love  CLYTIE  Confusion madness hell or yet what's worse  Oh give me breath sufficiently to curse  The world myselfand all my feeble race  What boast your falsehood own it to my face  Go tyrant seek the idol you adore  CLYTIE's weak claims shall trouble you no more  Hence stubborn weakness henceO tender fool  My heart yet fain would hold him could it be  But tutor'd by example I shall cool  And him disdain as he has slighted me  No more let love with golden shafts be drawn  Or downy mantled wing  But arm'd his hands  With flaming brands  And scorpion whips to sting  The wretches by his fell distemper gnawn  No more an infant heavendesign'd  But a grim monster fierce and blind  The curse and scourge of human kind  SCENE IV  PHOEBUS  Infernal Jealousy thou foe to rest  Despotic ruler in the female breast  Of Love begot unnatural and dire  Thou prey'st upon the vitals of thy fire  But see she comes whom no such pangs excite  The harbinger of ev'ry dear delight  She comes like teeming Spring along the plain  Youth Plenty Health and Pleasure in her train  SCENE V  PHOEBUS LEUCOTHOE  So in some ev'ning fair the feather'd male  Expects his tuneful consort in the vale  At sight of her his heart exulting springs  He rears his plume and beats his little wings  They meet they nestle to each other's breast  And side by side pursue their way to rest  LEUCOTHÖE  My lord my life  PHOEBUS  My best my tend'rest part  Thus let me clasp you to my panting heart  Hence ye prophane each ruder guest be far  The slaves of Business and the sons of War  Let none within these happy shades be seen  But such as wait upon the Paphian Queen  The sports the pleasures and the winged boys  Foes to suspicion and domestic noise  Passion may doubt and quarrel in decay  Ours still shall flourishOh LEUCOTHÖE    Embracing and gazing on her tenderly  Was ever creature form'd so fair  Sweets from ev'ry pore distilling  Such a shape and such an air  Lips so soft and eyes so killing  Turn oh turn these humid fires  I cannot bear their wounding glances  They fill my soul with fierce desires  And plunge me in extatic trances  LEUCOTHÖE  Oh welcome to my soul as after show'rs  Your own enliv'ning beams to fruits and flow'rs  Welcome as cooling wind to lab'ring swains  Or freedom to the wretch that groans in chains  Might this for ever ever be my place  To live and die in thy ador'd embrace  PHOEBUS  Oh thrilling joy oh more than charming she  Was ever deity caress'd like me  LEUCOTHÖE  Oh height of bliss oh greater than divine  Was ever mortal happiness like mine  PHOEBUS  How shall I speak the dictates of my heart  No language can express no actions prove  My meeting joys  LEUCOTHÖE  My sorrows when we part  PHOEBUS  How tenderly I doat  LEUCOTHÖE  How much I love  Who upon the oozy beach  Can count the num'rous sands that lie  Or distinctly reckon each  Transparent star that studs the sky  As their multitudes betray  And frustrate all attempts to tell  So 'tis impossible to say  How much we love we love so well  PHOEBUS  Be hush'd ye winds and you ye pow'rs accord  Who own the force of my superior word  Hear and obey ye deities that reign  O'er the green woods or haunt the dusky plain  Hear and obey ye softer forms that lave  In the cool font or stem the lucid wave  And ye that roll the rapid orbs on high    Soft music  LEUCOTHÖE  What sounds are these of melting melody  Which steal so soft and sweet upon my ears  PHOEBUS  Hark 'tis the music of the moving spheres  Obedient to thy beauties they advance  Th' harmonious measures of their tuneful dance  Nature exults affected by my joy  And see the sisters from their sacred height  In concert mingling all their art employ  Proud to administer to your delight  The music coming forward in a full symphony the clouds which obscured the head of the mountains suddenly disperse shewing  Parnassus  the Muses with their proper symbols  c  An entertainment is performed by them on their several instruments consisting of three parts the first very sonorous the second a slow movement to which a pastoral nymph dances the third sprightly when the lowest of the mountains opens discovering  Vulcan  's cave The  Cyclops  come out and dance with a number of Dryads who enter from the woods then range themselves on each side of the stage  Phoebus  and  Leucothöe  advance    LEUCOTHÖE  Methinks these scenes such wonder they inspire  I still could gaze upon and still admire  Yet for the present prithee let them cease  Our revels may offend the neighb'ring peace  And should they to my father's ears be brought  My blood runs cold and curdles at the thought  PHOEBUS  Causeless the thought and premature the fear  What can your father do when I am here  He and th'extensive empire which he sways  Struck by my word shall vanish like a blaze  Come thou poor trembling turtle seek thy mate  And safe beneath his pinion laugh at fate  PHOEBUS  and  LEUCOTHÖE  Hark Love summons us away  Let's obey  Come away  Hark Love summons us away  Just expiring  With desiring  Take oh take me while you may  Else I shall dissolve away  Stay my fleeting soul with kisses  Till we feed on fiercer blisses  Blisses Gods alone should share  Oh my life my joy my treasure  Oh the extasy the pleasure  'Tis too much too much to bear  The End of the First Act  ACT II  SCENE I  A nightprospect of a garden a pavilion in view beyond which appears the back part of a palace a terrace adorned with statues  c c  PHOEBUS  and  LEUCOTHOE  enter from the pavilion    CLYTIE  with a black slave listening behind    LEUCOTHÖE  THE winds are fast asleep there's scarce a breeze  To rock the little birds upon the trees  What grateful odours rise from ev'ry brake  See how the moonbeams shine on yonder lake  How softly sweet these waters fall to ground  That break the silence with their murm'ring sound  You will not sure so quickly bid farewel  I've yet a thousand things to ask and tell  PHOEBUS  And I could ever stay to talk and hear  But look how faint those glimm'ring fires appear  I must be gone by sad occasion prest  The morningstar already lights the East  Aurora now unbars the gates of day  And from that mountain summons me away  LEUCOTHÖE  Yet stayI know I've somewhat to impart  If you are absent long 'twill break my heart  How soon will you return  PHOEBUS  With double speed  I'll lash my coursers to their western bed  At nightBelieve me to my promise just  I'll come on wings  LEUCOTHÖE  Then must we part  PHOEBUS  We must  But for a few short hours restrain your tears  Why thus incompass'd with unusual fears  You droop  LEUCOTHÖE  Oh PHOEBUS  PHOEBUS  Say'st thou Prithee speak  LEUCOTHÖE  Forgive me I'm a woman fond and weak  In terror often when no danger's nigh  Perhaps I weep and fear I know not why  Why with sighs my heart is swelling  Why with tears my eyes o'erflow  Ask me not 'tis past the telling  Mute involuntary woe  Prizing joys we fear to lose 'em  Can you then condemn my pain  Something whispers to my bosom  We shall never meet again  PHOEBUS  Oh my dear love quick quickly drive away  Those boding thoughts which on your quiet prey  The breed of Fancy gender'd in the brain  Nurs'd by the grosser spirits light and vain  The vagrant visions of the sleeping mind  Which vanish wak'd nor leave a mark behind  When two kind doves their nest desert  A different passage to pursue  With gentle murmurs thus they part  LEUCOTHÖE  My life farewel  PHOEBUS  My love adieu  SCENE II  During this scene  Clytie  attempts coming forward several times but is withheld by her slave    LEUCOTHÖE  He's gone and left me hah what means this dread  Save me a sword hangs hov'ring o'er my head  Th' earth yawns to swallow me I sink oh Fate  Alas I'm frighted with my own conceit  Nor sword nor yawning earth is here and now  A lazy languor creeps along my veins  Dull and more dull my heavy eyelids grow  And ev'ry sense accepts the leaden chains  Oh God of Sleep arise and spread  Thy healing vapours round my head  To thy friendly mansions take  My soul that burns  Till he returns  For whom alone I wish to wake  There yield my thoughts their fav'rite theme  And bring my lover in a dream  SCENE III  CLYTIE  comes forward with the  BLACK SLAVE  A short silence  SLAVE  Why stand you thus bemus'd in silence lost  Fiendstruck you seem or frighted by some ghost  Alas she hears me not within her mind  As warring flames are in the earth confin'd  So is her rage and indignation pent  Dear Mistress  CLYTIE  Oh  SLAVE  There give your passion vent  Behold of love the so much boasted bliss  CLYTIE  Why was I born ye Gods since doom'd to this  Off idle ornaments detested glare  Of gold and jewels wherefore are ye here  Why am I dress'd in pompous robes like these  There's no one now whom I would wish to please  Let then my soul and body be akin  Naked without as desolate within  By various passions am I torn  Now with anger now with scorn  Now with fear my heart's recoiling  Now with rage my spirit's boiling  As the diff'rent plagues infest  To love or vengeance I incline  Now I could stab his faithless breast  Nowpress him close to mine  SLAVE  Assuage your transports you augment the ill  By nourishing those thoughts you ought to kill  CLYTIE  Hence paultry babbler when the loud winds sweep  Command the Nile's impetu'us surge to sleep  When burning Aetna rages bid it cease  Go sooth the tortures of the damn'd to peace  Their sieve their stone their vulture and their wheel  Are light are nothing to the pangs I feel  SLAVE  Take comfort  CLYTIE  Yes 'tis fix'd I'll die this hour  That's all the comfort now within my pow'r  A dagger ends at once my life and care  SLAVE  Oh toss'd on seas of ruinous despair  Yet hear me e'er you split upon this shelf  Revenge on those who wrong younot yourself  CLYTIE  Revenge on whom a God  SLAVE  The best revenge  Pay falsehood back with falsehood change for change  Try softer hearts exert your charms and show  Indifferent as he leaves you let him go  When unpity'd we languish  And sigh for a swain  Who feels not our anguish  But laughs at our pain  In vain we pursue his untractable mind  With whining  And crying  And wishing  And dying  Then scorn the perplexer and look out to find  Another as lovelyanother more kind  CLYTIE  Is this the mighty veng'ance you propose  This the kind comfort then you yield my woes  To sue to others and from them obtain  What all my love deserved from him in vain  Returns I've hadHow sweet  SLAVE  How quickly past  Better ne'er tasted since they could not last  CLYTIE  And shall I turn a beggar with my charms  The thought with double strength my fury arms  No thus at once my farther pangs I save    Drawing a dagger  SLAVE  Behold upon her knees your faithful slave  Oh let my tears my services prevail  We've means of great revenge which cannot fail  CLYTIE  Avaunt  SLAVE  Oh hear me  CLYTIE  Yet again beware  Nor tempt the fury of my rage too far  Come thou last only friend thy work pursue    Looking at the dagger as she holds it ready to strike    SLAVE  By all my hopes of happiness 'tis true  The object of your jealousy shall die  CLYTIE  pausing from the stroke  Go on  SLAVE  First lay that dreadful weapon by  I cannot speak your looks my words appal  CLYTIE  throwing away the dagger  Said'st thou not she th' accursed she should fall  You held my arm or she ere this had lain  Dead at my feet  SLAVE  And she shall still be slain  But not by you the God already cold  What then should gain his love his veng'ance hold  CLYTIE  Speak quick the means my soul has ta'en alarm  And all my flutt'ring senses round me arm  Oh give me poison racks consuming fire  Swift as my rage and wild as my desire  SLAVE  Nor poison racks nor fire we need to wait  The King her father be our means of fate  To him unfold in secret all you know  You point the weapon but he strikes the blow  CLYTIE  I'll do'teach moment is a year's delay  'Tis clear 'tis obvious as the noontideday  By passion blinded by despair misled  I walk'd in cloudsShe is already dead  My rival's doom'd I see her on the ground  I hear her groansThere's music in the sound  SLAVE  Look where in shades those myrtlebranches throng  The King appears and this way moves along  The time th' occasion both conspire to bless  Your great design and crown it with success  CLYTIE  What sudden tremors seize upon my heart  Cold dewy damps from ev'ry pore perspire  No matterInjur'd Love perform thy part  The consequence be what it mayRetire  SCENE IV  CLYTIE  Hence weak remorse hence hence away  In vain before my dazzl'd eyes  In all your daunting shapes you rise  To fill me with dismay  Your checks I defy  My rival shall die  And thou whose false ungrateful heart  Thy immortality secures  Look down while I revenge my smart  And thro' her bosom strike at your's  SCENE V  ORCHAMUS CLYTIE  ORCHAMUS  Hail roseate dawn at whose approaching light  Spectres and birds illomen'd take their flight  Thou at whose rise Shame seeks Cimmerian shades  And Lust and Murder hide their horrid heads  Hope springs aloft the mists of Grief exhale  And Life and Joy renew their courseall hail  CLYTIE  kneeling  May the King live for ever  ORCHAMUS  Rise bright maid  Thou shouldst not pay obeisance but be paid  Abroad thus early have you made your way  To add new charms to or outshine the day  CLYTIE  To view the infant morning at its birth  As first it rose upon the darken'd earth  When great Jove utter'd the creative word  And Nature all alive obey'd her Lord  To hear the birds observe the waking flow'r  And wond'ring at Heav'n's works adore its pow'r  ORCHAMUS  Exalted Wisdom from those lips it broke  Was it an angel or fair CLYTIE spoke  How much superior beauty awes  The coldest bosoms find  But with resistless force it draws  To sense and virtue join'd  The casket where to outward show  The artist's hand is seen  Is doubly valu'd when we know  It holds a gem within  CLYTIE  aside  Now tremble ye inconstants wheresoe'er  Who cheat with fraudful vows th'unwary fair  Fate is at workLove sits on Justice' throne  And hastens to chastise you all in one    Going to speak to  Orchamus  she corrects herself    ORCHAMUS  What would'st thou Speak But now there something sprung  Warm from your heart which froze upon your tongue  Give it free airlay chilling fears aside  And on a Monarch's faith and pow'r confide  CLYTIE  Yet why should friendship force me to reveal  And tell him that which pity should conceal  ORCHAMUS  Whate'er you would demand my grant ensues  When beauty asks can ORCHAMUS refuse  Say then what thoughts so cruel to molest  The peaceful tenour of that gentle breast  CLYTIE  Ask not the subject of my thoughts which known  Perhaps may spoil the quiet of your own  ORCHAMUS  Virtue unmov'd the thund'rer's voice can hear  To guilt a stranger we're unknown to fear  CLYTIE  Ay but some ills there are of such a kind  So black so dreadful ev'n the virtuous mind  Cannot support their shock which leave a sting  Like vice behindOh ill requited King  Think is there nothing could affect you more  Than loss of state dominion wealth and pow'r  ORCHAMUS  You deal in riddles  CLYTIE  Dreadful to expound  Oh be my tongue to silence ever bound  Drive drive me from you to the farthest pole  ORCHAMUS  You mean to stagger my determin'd soul  CLYTIE  Your daughter  ORCHAMUS  What of her I shake all o'er  CLYTIE  Yet send me hence in time and seek no more  Farewel    Going  ORCHAMUS  Return I charge you haste come back    She returns  You would not leave me thus upon the rack  Say is my daughter deadI think I can  At least I'll tryto bear it like a man  CLYTIE  Was that the worst how easy to be said  For what's the loss of life Her honour's dead  Her virtue  ORCHAMUS  Hah beware  CLYTIE  But now these eyes  Beheld them rev'ling in their guilty joys  Ev'n here they parted as you sought the place  I could have stabb'd them in their last embrace  ORCHAMUS  O name the traitor that he soon may bleed  CLYTIE  The God you worship Sir has done the deed  The glorious SUN inspir'd with lustful flame  Has paid your incense with your daughter's shame  ORCHAMUS  'Tis wellOh Kings your boasted pow'r how small  Where when did he Damnation tell me all  CLYTIE  At a silent secret hour  Softly stealing to her bow'r  There he found the lovesick maid  Wishing warm and unarray'd  Fir'd with the charming sight  Soon began the am'rous fight  Their pulse beat high to love's alarms  He stroveand triumph'd o'er her charms  ORCHAMUS  What's to be done Confusion shame and death  This hand shall stop the wanton strumpet's breath  I gave her beinghow then shall I take  That being from herORCHAMUS awake  'Tis dreams chimera's allimperfect wild  Justice commands me to destroymy child  At once a father and a judge  How shall I bid her die or live  There one severely would condemn  The other tenderly forgive    Walks about in great disorder  CLYTIE  aside  What a rough war contending Passion keeps  Now the storm's up now hah by Heav'n he weeps  Oh may these drops like those which fall from high  Before the rapid thunder rends the sky  Be the forerunners of approaching wrath  And bode destruction perils rage and death  ORCHAMUS  Ye furies that howl in the abyss profound  Hither hither repair  From the wilds of Despair  And encompass me round  Each a torch in her hand  Take your terrible stand  From my breast keep all motions of pity away  And when Nature speaks  In your yellings and shrieks  Drown her soft'ning plea  What honour demands 'tis our duty to give  Who merits to die shall we suffer to live  SCENE VI  CLYTIE  Oh glorious hearing oh triumphant day  Thus great Nemesis thus my thanks I pay  Now now false God your recompence receive  And in your turn confess the pangs you gave  Fly care to the wind  My fate has been kind  Oh pleasure  Past measure  Transcendently great  No more I complain  Of ungrateful disdain  If I suffer in love I triumph in hate  The

wild beast lurking in his den  Avoids the haunts of no less savage men  Among these rocks the horrid cavern lies  Doom'd to receive the Royal sacrifice  CHORUS  Oh dreadful sentence unrelenting fate  Mourn all ye sons of prostrate Persia mourn  From hence let sorrow take an endless date  Tears follow tears and sighs to sighs return  In an eternal course of piercing woe  Such as from shame despair and grief should flow  A MAN and a WOMAN  A nymph adorn'd with ev'ry grace  So soft a form so fair a face  With Venus she may vie  Like some sweet flow'r untimely crop  Ah must she fade ah must she drop  Ah must she must she die  A MAN  Soft break ye quickly off west o'er the beach  Far as the eye its piercing beams can stretch  Lo where the victim 'midst a mournful throng  In solemn slow procession moves along  A WOMAN  She comes a living coarse what eye but weeps  At the sad spectacleNow SUN eclipse  At once the lover and the God assume  And snatch her trembling from th' untimely tomb  SCENE II  A procession appears at a considerable distance consisting of priests youths virgins  c c Leucothöe  in the centre covered with a black veil as it approaches the audience the following semichorus is sung with frequent pauses    SEMICHORUS  Prepare ye Stygian pow'rs prepare  In all your pomp of horrors dress'd  Ye dreadful ministers of fate  Set wide Death's adamantine gate  For lo we bring a guest  Prepare prepare prepare    The procession being come to the front of the stage    STROPHE  Hear injur'd chastity pure essence hear  From yonder marble sphere  Wheree'er thou hold'st thy mansion in the skies  Look down look down  From thy exalted and starspangled throne  To thee we sacrifice  CHORUS  To thee  To thee we sacrifice  ANTISTROPHE  Hear Justice awfulest of beings hear  Tremend'ous and severe  Thou whose stern resolution never dies  Look down look down  From thy immovable immortal throne  To thee we sacrifice  CHORUS  To thee  To thee we sacrifice  EPODE  To her to thee our voice we raise  Avert your anger from the state  Deign to accept a nation's praise  And let the forfeiture she pays  Her crime expiate  SEMICHORUS  Prepare ye Stygian pow'rs prepare  In all your pomp of horrors dress'd  Ye dreadful ministers of fate  Set wide Death's adamantine gate  For lo we bring a guest  Prepare prepare prepare  LEUCOTHÖE  Putting aside the veil She appears in white with fillets after the manner of a sacrifice  Oh mighty God that guides the day  A moment stop your rapid way  Behold me in this dreadful strife  Just tott'ring on the brink of life  No help no friendly comfort nigh  To break my fall  Beset with all  The terrors of eternity  While doubts and fear  My bosom tear  And with alternate passion vie  Think when you see  And pity me  Oh think it is for you I die  A YOUTH  Thy charms just rising to their noon  Ah must we see them set so soon  A VIRGIN  Those charms which distant princes woo'd  And deities themselves pursu'd  A YOUTH  What heart that is not frozen quite  But must in thy afflictions share  A VIRGIN  To see oh melancholy sight  To see you plung'd in sudden night  A YOUTH  To be you know not what  A VIRGIN  To go you know not where  LEUCOTHÖE  Weep not my dear companions  CHORUS  of  Youths  and  Virgins  Cruel stroke  Can nothing then thy destiny revoke  LEUCOTHÖE  No we must part e'en now fate lifts the sheers  To cut the thread of my scarce halfspun years  Farewel when poor LEUCOTHÖE's forgot  Oh may you find a more indulgent lot  May each be happy in some nymph or youth  Proud to repay your tenderness and truth  Then if between the transports of your bliss  You should recount a piteous tale like this  Of some poor creature by her love betray'd  As the sad accidents your mem'ry strike  Bestow a tear in pity to my shade  And mourn at once two fates so much alike  YOUTH and VIRGIN  Come Sorrow from thy gloomy cell  Where in eternal rage you dwell  From thy bed of raven's plumes  Curtain'd round with dusky fumes  CHORUS  Come and with you bring your groans  Frantic gestures sullen moans  Fury of conflicting passions  Sighs and tears and lamentations  Join with us in doleful lay  Rage and Death triumph today    The procession disperses and the music strikes dead and solemn    SCENE III  ORCHAMUS LEUCOTHOE c c  ORCHAMUS  Hold yet a moment ere the impervious skreen  Which severs world from world be drawn between  Ere yet I am of all my hopes beguil'd  Let me once more embrace my wretched child  The judge the sov'reign have their parts supply'd  And now the parent will be satisfy'd  LEUCOTHÖE  My father oh be quick to drive me down  Gape wide ye rocks and save me from his frown  ORCHAMUS  Be not of thy fond father's frowns afraid  Nor think he comes thy folly to upbraid  No rather to these sad proceedings loath  He comes to mourn the cause which ruins both  That rigid honour whose stern voice demands  Thy forfeit life at his unwilling hands  LEUCOTHÖE  To death without repining I submit  As to a thing which Heaven and you think fit  Whate'er hath been my crime while yet I live  Let me but hear you pity and forgive  ORCHAMUS  Forgive you pity you oh that I do  These tears be witness which my cheeks bedew  Would any thing but death might purge our line  From your offence or any death but thine  For with thee all my joys will take their leave  And I shall walk in sorrow to the grave  LEUCOTHÖE  Stop stop those sacred show'rs they must not fall  For me I now indeed am criminal  ORCHAMUS  The motherhind  Distract in mind  Her young one made the hunter's prey  Wide o'er the lawn  From rosy dawn  To dewy ev'ning takes her way  Till quite o'ercome  With fruitless pain  Weary'd at length she lays her down  In sad despair  And fills the plain  All night with miserable moan  'Tis thus when thou art gone thy Sire shall be  So shall he wish by day so mourn at night for thee  LEUCOTHÖE  Behold thus low your wretched indiscreet  Unhappy daughter casts her at your feet  Oh wherefore did not my frail being end  Ere I had pow'r such goodness to offend  Before my crimes had stain'd my royal race  Or drawn a tear along that sacred face  ORCHAMUS  Good heav'n and earth turn Nature turn aside  Turn nor behold this pious parricide  Lest blind to chance and ign'rant of the cause  You think mankind like me has left your laws  To  Leucothöe  Farewel the time calls on us we must part  This last embraceDown down my swelling heart  LEUCOTHÖE  Look on me  ORCHAMUS  You there who attend the rites  Haste to perform the farther requisites  Nature lie still  LEUCOTHÖE  I comeOh why my blood  Why run'st thou to my heart a freezing flood  Why trembl'st thou my flesh Limbs yet awhile  Support mebut a few short moments past  Dissolving Death shall free you from your toil  And give ye up to everlasting rest  A rock being removed the mouth of the caverns appears She starts then advances towards it  Thou dark abyss whose womb obscene  Is fraught with ev'ry mortal pain  Whose horrid jaws in dread display  Gape to devour metake your prey  Receive me yet the vital lamps  All burning with spiritu'us fire  Among thy raw unwholesome damps  Unseen unpity'd to expire    The priest preparing to put her down  ORCHAMUS  Stay yet again forbearan instant hold  Ye Gods regard me I'm infirm and old    Kneeling  A load of grief unable to sustain  Let not the weak and suppliant beg in vain  If with mistaken piety I rate  This crime if justice asks not what I give  Arrest th' uplifted arm of vengeful fate  Appear and bid the destin'd victim live  CHORUS  Your blissful mansions leave  Appear and save  STROPHE  The pow'rs are silent to our pray'r  ANTISTROPHE  Nor signs of mercy shew  STROPHE  Whom Heav'n condemns shall mortal spare  SROPHE ANTISTROPHE  No no no    They put her into a cavern  ORCHAMUS    Turning about just as she disappears    Ye solid poles give way ye skies roll back  Earth from your deep foundations be disjoin'd  Burst nature round me in a gen'ral wrack  All horrible confusion like my mind  Oh me unhappy father where  Where shall I go to seek relief  Ev'ry object ev'ry place  Tends my sorrows to encrease  Not one to blot away my care  Not one to cure my grief  SCENE IV  Enter  CLYTIE  in wild disorder followed by her Slaves    CLYTIE  Oh are you found Sir What is't you have done  To raise the anger of th' immortal SUN  Speak quickly answer me without delay  Where is your daughter where's LEUCOTHÖE  ORCHAMUS  I prithee ask me not my heartveins bleed  Each time I think of itOh where indeed  Where butdread consequence of jealous spleen  For thy officiousness she ne'er had been  CLYTIE  For my officiousness What then you'd make  Me partner of your guiltPerdition take  The execrable purposeI disclaim  Whatever you have done Look to't the blame  On your own headBut hark it comes apace  The thunder comesFly instant fly this place  Would you their safety or your own consult    Pointing to those about him  For my part I shall stay to meet the bolt  Orchamus  and his people withdraw    SCENE V  PHOEBUS  with the  HORAE CLYTIE  with her Slaves    PHOEBUS  entring  Oh most accursed King inhuman Sire  My life my love my only heart's desire  LEUCOTHÖE Oh murder'dHence away  Like light'ning help her ere 'tis yet too late    To the Hours  If there's a spark of life unquench'd we may  Redeem her still and snatch her soul from fate    Going off  CLYTIE  kneeling  Oh PHOEBUS hither turn your angry eyes    Exit  Phoebus Clytie  looking after him    What gone without a word  SLAVE  Dear Lady rise  Think where you are  CLYTIE  Went he not frowning too  What sudden horrors rush upon my view  Rising and casting round her eyes  What desolate coast is this we tread  So like the dreary nation of the dead  Thus wretched Ariadne left behind  Wept on the shores of Argos bleak and bare  While cruel Theseus fled before the wind  Nor listen'd to the voice of her despair  SLAVE  Laid her on gently  CLYTIE  Stay ye yet awhile  My brain's on fire my blood begins to boil  What do you hold me forStand off  SLAVE  Alas  What still I've fear'dat length is come to pass  Her senses are disturb'd    Thunder  CLYTIE  What noise was that  Jove talkingall the Gods are in debate  Upon my future welfareHark hark hark  Not a word more'tis grown exceeding dark  See clouds on clouds above each other rise  In sable mountains to obscure the skies  'Tis done Where am I Let me grope my way  Again thro' this black passage into day  Ah wretch bewilder'd wretch  In vain my arms I stretch  In vain I feel about  Will no kind star afford its light  To guide my erring steps aright  No friendly hand held out  Conduct me thro' this gloom of night  SLAVE  Patience sweet patience all shall yet go well  CLYTIE  At length the vapours gradu'lly dispel  Sure 'tis the dawn from yonder point it breaks  Bright'ning the front of heav'n with rosy streaks    Thunder again  There leap'd th' eternal coursers with a bound  From the green floodand now 'tis light around  Lo where aloft immortal PHOEBUS stands  Graceful the reins depending from his hands  He looks he smiles he beckons me from far  I run I fly I mount the fiery car  Oh Triumph Triumph seated by his side  Sublime in splendor thro' the air I ride  We come we come  Make room make room  Now climbing heav'n's stupend'ous steep  We view the Empyrean height  Now o'er the smooth meridian sweep  The earth below too small for sight  Now down the blue concave descending again  Impetu'us we drive to the western main  While at every crash  Of the thundering lash  As we whirl along the zodiac round  Replies to the stroke and ecchoes the sound  Bless me oh how am I oppress'd  Soft lay me gently down to rest  CHORUS  Her wits return ye pow'rs restore  And yield her to herself once more  CLYTIE  the slaves laying her on the ground  At some tall mountain's hoary feet  With shelving rocks and trees o'erhung  Whose head incessant tempests beat  And ravens pester all day long  Let mewhere slow meander steers  Its course upon the banks reclin'd  Augment the water with my tears  And with my sighs increase the wind  SCENE VI  PHOEBUS CLYTIE c c  PHOEBUS  Desist desist your pains are fruitless all  The vital spirit's fled beyond recal  Sunk to those shades from whence it ne'er must rise  From whence grim Pluto never yields a prize  Inexorable pow'rOh might we mix  Ev'n here content from heav'n I would remove  Upon thy ruthless sepulchre to fix  A monument of wretchedness and love  One of the HORAE  Far be such sorrows from the God of DAY  Who next to Jove bears universal sway  Suppose your mistress dead exert your pow'r  She still may glide a stream expand a flow'r  Or rising stately in the sylvan scene  Stretch forth a leafy umbrage o'er the green  PHOEBUS  It shall be so yes dear unhappy maid  Since thy sad lover can no farther aid  Since stubborn Death denies to loose his hold  And yield thy beauties in their proper mold  Thus I pronounceGrow fruitful steril grave  And strait do thou thy former species leave  Existtho' not as thou wert wont to be  No more a woman flourish in a tree  So shall thy body changed as heretofore  Teach deities to bend and mortals to adore  CHORUS  What sudden fragrance fills the air  Lo the blooming shoots appear  Parent earth  Assist the birth  So shall her body chang'd as heretofore  Teach deities to bend and mortals to adore  The body of  Leucothöe  supposed to be changed into a tree of frankincense rises slowly out of the rock    PHOEBUS  Thrice sacred plant  Thus Heav'n thy favour'd growth endows  A spicy scent  Spring ever from thy teeming boughs  While round thy root rich unguent flows  The tears you shed  To Gods a grateful sacrifice  On altars laid  In aromatic smoke shall rise  And plead for mortals with the skies  Phoebus  about to withdraw    CLYTIE  starting up catches hold of his robe  By the breeze that passing sighs  By the rocks that round us rise  By the stars that dimly glow  Witness of my present woe  By the mountains by the woods  By the grotto's by the floods  By the dear transporting nights  Witness of our past delights  For lovefor former friendship's sake  I charge you stayand hear me speak  PHOEBUS  Unhand me  CLYTIE  Mercy  PHOEBUS  Fury let me go  Or  CLYTIE  Never never will I loose youOh  Grant me a little strengthDo break my hands  Destroy me Dash me on those flinty sands  Yet still persisting will I hold you fast  And striving to embrace you breathe my last  PHOEBUS  dragging her out of sight  Nay then  CLYTIE  O stayKind Venus help afford  Here let me grow a statue  PHOEBUS  returning  At your word  I take youBe the thing that you desire  A dread example of immortal ire  Fix'd to that spot remain to future times  An instance of my veng'ance and your crimes  CLYTIE  behind the rocks  WhatWhat is this I feelI'm bound  My feet are rooted to the ground  A sudden stupor o'er me comes  That ev'ry faculty benumbs  Cold cold I freeze  My blood congeals  My eyesight fails  Death invades me by degrees  I stiffen upwardCruelso  My heartmy voicehelphelp meoh  PHOEBUS  'Tis thus I have reveng'd in one just hour  My injur'd love and my offended pow'r  Expose that wretch  The  Horae  setting aside the rocks which obscured her discover  Clytie  transformed to a statue Her  Slaves  gather about it weeping    Such ever be the end  Of those rash mortals who with Gods contend  But first to finish what there yet remains  Thou horrid prospect of dry sandy plains  Unfit all rueful as ye now appear  To nurse the precious reliques of my dear  Smooth your rough facewith instant verdure crown'd  Let smiling Spring encompass ye around  While we in decent sorrows mourn the dead  And with due rites appease her injur'd shade  The scene is totally changed to a delightful prospect of a champaign country the Tree and Statue still in view A dance is performed proper to the subject  CHORUS  Enough enough your games give o'er  The wellpleas'd ghost demands no more  Deep in the coverts of the grove  Where helpless lovers joy to rove  Secure she rests nor farther heeds  The weak effects of earthly deeds  FINIS
