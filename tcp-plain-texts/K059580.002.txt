 JULIA  A NOVEL INTERSPERSED WITH SOME POETICAL PIECES  BY HELEN MARIA WILLIAMS  IN TWO VOLUMES  VOL II  LONDON PRINTED FOR T CADELL MDCCXC  JULIA  A NOVEL  CHAP XXI  MR Clifford accompanied by Julia and Chartres arrived in London soon after Christmas where a spacious and elegant house at the west end of the town was prepared for their reception  Frederick Seymour had taken a house for himself in the neighbourhood and he and Charlotte were settled in town a few days before Mr Clifford arrived  Julia since the period of Seymour's marriage had endeavoured by every effort in her power to banish his idea from her mind She carefully avoided thinking of him because she now felt herself inclined to pity while she blamed his unfortunate passion since he had fulfilled his engagements at the price of peace and had renounced all chance of happiness to comply with the demands of honor But Julia was conscious that though this conduct gave him some claim to her esteem esteem was a sentiment which it was dangerous to cherish and that on this subject reflection was at cruel variance with repose since whenever the idea of Seymour recurred to her mind she was imperceptibly led into a comparison between him and others and the decision which her heart involuntarily made was by no means conducive to its tranquillity But though she had not the  merit of insensibility the purity of her mind corrected the softness of her heart Rectitude stood in the place of indifference and since she could not entirely controul her feelings she disregarded them altogether and only studied with a servent desire of acting right to regulate her conduct by the strictest propriety  It was at her solicitation that Mr Clifford remained in the country till after Christmas He was impatient to see his daughter but Julia always found some reason for delay and procrastinated the journey to town till no farther pretence could be urged without incurring suspicion She attended him to town prepared to act a part which she felt would be difficult but which she stedfastly resolved should be free from selfreproach  The day before her departure from the country she visited alone the ancient  chapel where the remains of her father and grandfather were deposited Here she continued kneeling a considerable time at the tomb wrapt in meditation and finding it every moment more difficult to tear herself from the spot At length she arose and clasping her hands together while she continued gazing on the tomb "Oh my father" she cried "thou canst no longer guide and direct thy child but may she never forget thy precepts And thou ever beloved and venerable old man whose honored image still lives in my heart oh may thy sacred remembrance be the surest guard of my conduct If I am ever tempted to deviate from the path of rectitude may I but think of thee and surely my heart will return to its duty oh never never can I mediate on  thee  and persevere in what is wrongDearest old man though the grave hides thee from my view the recollection  of thy goodness thy sanctity shall be as a shield to thy offspring and may thy exemplary piety have entailed a blessing on thy descendants Oh may I liveand may I die like thee"  Mr Clifford when near London sent a servant forward to inform his daughter of his coming Frederick Seymour was not at home but Charlotte hastened to her father's house where she had soon the pleasure of receiving him When their first emotions at meeting had subsided Charlotte intreated her father and Julia to go home with her and spend the day at her house They were preparing to set out in Charlotte's carriage when Julia's maid came into the room and begged to speak to her Julia went out and the maid said to her "Indeed Ma'am I could not help calling you out for I went into the hall just now to look after some of the boxes and  there's a poor old man standing at the foot of the steps that says Ma'am he knows you and begged me for the love of God to supplicate you to see him and indeed Ma'am I had not the heart to refuse the poor old creature he looked so pitiful"  Julia desired she would tell him to come into the hall The old man ascended the steps with great difficulty leaning on a stick with one hand and holding by the palisades with the other His face was pale and deeply furrowed with wrinkles and his features which were strong had a marked expression of settled sorrow A considerable quantity of white hair which was parted in the middle of his forehead hung down his cheeks his coat which frequent patching had rendered of many colours did not appear dirty and his linen was perfectly clean His figure though much bent by age and infirmity still  retained something of a military air and though he tottered as he walked his step was not that of a clown  Julia recollected him instantly he was an old soldier who had served in her grandfather's company had fought the same battles and shared the same dangers After nineteen years service he obtained his discharge on account of ill health but was not entitled to the benefit of Chelseahospital His son however who was a carpenter maintained him by his labour Julia remembered from her infancy this old man who used to make frequent visits to her father's house where he was always received with kindness She had often flown with eagerness when a child to announce his arrival to her grandfather by whom she had been early taught  To press the bashful stranger to his food  And learn the luxury of doing good  Julia was shocked at seeing the old man so much altered and emaciated He told her that his son had died four months ago of a fever and that since that period he had suffered extreme distress "I have been forced Madam" said the old man "to part with every bit of furniture that was in our room to pay the rent and keep body and soul together I have nothing left but the bed I lie onbut all won't do Madam and I must go to the parish at last Oh wherefore" said the old man bursting into tears "wherefore is light given to him that is in misery and life unto the bitter in soul which look for death but it cometh not and seek for it more than for hid treasures But I heard Madam two days ago that you would be here so I thought I would see you once more before I die I knew you would have compassion for me"  "Yes indeed" said Julia with eagerness  "my good old friend you shall never want while I can relieve you think no more of going to the parish we will provide for you"  The poor old man could not speak but he wept bitterly Julia led him herself into a parlour A porter who had been assisting to carry in the baggage and passed through the hall while she was carefully leading the old man with the tears standing in her eyes said to one of the servants "Aye she may die when she likes for swearing a terrible oath she's sure enough of going to heaven" Julia ordered wine for the old man and when he was revived by it left him to tell her uncle what had passed She returned with Mr Clifford and Charlotte who listened with the utmost compassion to the old man while he repeated his tale of sorrow and dwelt on the virtues of his son When he had eased his heart by this recital  he talked of his old master and of Captain Clifford fought over his past battles and lamented Captain Clifford's untimely death with a simplicity of honest sorrow which drew tears from all his auditors Julia was so much affected that her uncle and Charlotte hurried her away but not till the old man had received a liberal donation together with the assurance of a comfortable provision for the remainder of his life While he putting his feeble hands together implored that the "blessing of him who was ready to perish might be upon them"  In the way to Frederick Seymour's house Julia dried her tears and endeavoured to compose her mind that she might meet him with the calmness she wished but the figure of the old soldier presented itself to her imagination and the words he had uttered concerning her father rested upon her heart  She felt the deepest depression of spirits but when the carriage stopt at Seymour's door and she saw him hastening through the hall to receive them she summoned all her spirit and assumed an appearance of serenity Seymour was far from being so collected his embarrassment was but too evident to Julia He used again and again the same expressions of pleasure and repeated the same enquiries till he was at length checked by Chartres who gravely declared that the question which Mr Seymour then asked him he had answered three times already Had Charlotte been less unsuspecting or Mr Clifford more penetrating they could not have failed to observe the strange and distracted manner in which Seymour performed the honours of his table When the servants had withdrawn "Come" said Mr Clifford "my dear children let us drink a  bumper to the happiness of our newmarried pair Julia my love come fill your glass to the brim and pledge me to your cousin's happiness" Julia filled her glass wished Charlotte all happiness bowed to Seymour and after swallowing a few drops put down her glass "Fie Julia" said Mr Clifford "you ought to have emptied your glass to this toast" Julia changed colour and again took up her glass "Why really Julia" resumed Mr Clifford "you drink  my  toast as if it were a very serious business" "Indeed my dear" said Charlotte "you've performed your part with as much sad solemnity as if you had a presage that we were  not  to be happy" This remark in Julia's present state of agitation was more than she could bear her emotion was too great to be controuled and she burst into tears "My dearest Charlotte" said she taking her cousin's  hand "be but as happy as  I  wish you and you will be blest indeed" "My dear friend" said Charlotte "I know all your affection but why indulge this sadness I assure you I shall find happiness a very dismal thing unless you will consent to be happy too" "This old soldier has affected you" said Mr Clifford "but you must not indulge low spirits my love you must be chearful for my sake you know you are my only child now Charlotte has forsaken me and I can't live without you" "I am grateful" said Julia in a broken voice "indeed I am" Seymour during this scene sat fixed like a statue his eyes were riveted on Julia his lips sometimes moved but he did not utter a word Julia recovering herself a little cast a glance at Seymour perceived his situation and feared that Charlotte would observe it  "Will you give me a glass of water Mr Seymour" said she in order to rouze him from his stupor He started as from a dream and poured some water into a glass "I am quite ashamed of myself" said Julia "few have so much reason to be happy as I have but the old soldier has sunk my spirits However" added she with a smile "I promise never to behave so ill again and this once you must all forgive me" Charlotte and Julia soon after left the room  When they were gone Mr Clifford filled his glass "Come" said he "Seymour let us drink your cousin's health" "With all my heart" said Seymour filling his glass hastily "Really" said Chartres "Miss Clifford seems vastly ill I never saw her look so pale" added he turning to Seymour "except the day  you  were married" "YesI recollectI  mean I remember" replied Seymour speaking with difficulty "she was affected at parting with her friend" "I do not wonder she is ill" said Mr Clifford" the old soldier talked of my poor father and brother till I could scarcely bear it myself" "But" rejoined Chartres "Miss Clifford was certainly ill before the old soldier arrived I fancy the air of London disagrees with her and she seemed to feel it at some miles distance for I observed that during the last stage her colour went and came every minute" Seymour listened in agony to these observations which however made no impression on Mr Clifford who when Chartres had finished his speech said with warmth that Julia was a charming creature and that he loved her like his own child "Indeed" added he "she is one of those women whom it is impossible not to love"  Impossible indeed thought Seymour "Her disposition is very amiable" he replied "So amiable" said Mr Clifford "and her person so lovely that I wonder any young man can see her with indifference" Ah thought Seymour who  can  see her with indifference "She is a charming young woman" he rejoined "I hope" said Mr Clifford "to have the pleasure of seeing her happily settled this winter Her countenance and figure tacked to ten thousand pounds I think bid fair for a good marriage and when she is settled I shall have nothing to do but to die" Seymour listened to this matrimonial project with the feelings of a criminal who hears his own condemnation His soul recoiled at this plan of felicity and he longed to persuade Mr Clifford that happiness and matrimony had formed no inseparable alliance but on the contrary  were often quite estranged from each other He had however the prudence not to trust his feelings on this subject and remained silent while his uneasiness was entirely unobserved by Mr Clifford  When Seymour reflected on what had past he was not much displeased at the recollection of the cause of Julia's emotion at dinner nor was he concerned at the information that she looked pale on the day of his marriage and that her colour went and came during the last stage Such is the selfishness the inconsistency of passion that Seymour though he would chearfully have sacrificed his life to save Julia the slightest uneasiness would yet willingly have excited in her mind those sensations which overwhelmed his own with anguish and have been soothed by acquiring an influence over her heart which he well knew would never in  the smallest degree affect her conduct and which indeed his own principles of honor and a respect for her character which amounted almost to idolatry prevented him even from wishing it should He might therefore have reflected that any sensibility to his passion could only serve to involve her in a degree of misery which was almost insupportable to himself But the region of passion is a land of despotism where reason exercises but a mock jurisdiction and is continually forced to submit to an arbitrary tyrant who rejecting her fixed and temperate laws is guided only by the dangerous impulse of his own violent and uncontroulable wishes  CHAP XXII  MR Charles Seymour lost not a moment in paying his respects to Julia upon her arrival in town expressed the most lively pleasure at seeing her expatiated on the encreased bloom of her complexion spoke in his lowest tone and assumed his most finished mode of address Julia at length quite fatigued with softness and oppressed with panegyric told him "that she was obliged to go out" finding that like most other dull people he was subject to the error of making long visits and was at present too much engrossed by the care of acting his part gracefully to remark her extreme weariness of his performance  He intreated to have the honor of attending her where she was going and they walked to her milliner's where caps and ribbons seemed to sharpen his wit and furnish him with new modes of compliment and where he waited with great resignation while she purchased several articles of dress No set of people are so patient as the interested They drudge on indefatigably in the same circle and with one uniform pace as quietly as a horse in a mill contentedly expecting the end of their labours Julia could at last only get rid of Mr Charles Seymour's attendance by calling on Charlotte at whose door he took his leave filled with selfcomplacency at the progress he was convinced he had that morning made in her favor but at the same time recollecting that the extraordinary trouble he was now obliged to take was owing to his former entire neglect of the lady and marking it as  one of his future maxims that a young woman who has a rich uncle in the East Indies although she has no fortune herself is to be treated with gallantry In the mean time he reconciled himself to his past conduct by reflecting that there are some events which no prudence can foresee and some errors which experience only can correct  Charlotte was going to call on Mr Chartres's mother where Julia accompanied her They were received with infinite delight by Chartres who had returned to his mother's house where he found nothing that could atone for the loss of their society and Mrs Chartres was also glad to see them not solely on account of their kindness to her son but likewise because she thought so splendid an equipage as Charlotte's did honor to her door and reflected some of the lustre of its silver trappings on herself It is necessary to give a sketch of this Lady's character  Mrs Chartres was one of those persons to whom time is a burden which without the assistance of cards would be insupportable She considered whist as the first end of existence and the sole pleasure of society for she thought conversation the dullest occupation in the world and although she knew there was such a term as friendship her feelings did not convey much force to its meaning Yet she was not insensible of some preference towards those who gave her the best dinners A present of a brace of woodcocks of which she was remarkably fond would also secure her partial regard and a young hare never failed to win her heart With too little sensibility to feel her own deficiencies and too little discernment to perceive when she was treated with contempt Mrs Chartres could bear neglect without mortification and derision without resentment She was perfectly satisfied  with being admitted into company as one who helped to make up the necessary number at a whist table and to act a part which an automaton with a very little farther improvement in mechanism could have performed as well It was fortunate for Mrs Chartres that she was not difficult in her choice of society or rigorous in her demands of attention and respect for she found solitude the most insupportable of all evils Her mind resembled an empty mirror which has no character no images of its own borrows every impression from some passing object and if left to itself would for ever remain vacant  Mrs Chartres delighted in new acquaintances for in proportion as she was known she generally found people's civilities decline But this never gave her any uneasiness because she contrived with great ease to provide herself with a succession of new visitors  She kept a pack of visiting tickets in her pocketbook and wherever she went distributed them liberally to any strangers who were near her or with whom she happened to play at cards By these means her acquaintance was numerous though not very select but she comprehended so little the difference between one person and another if they were equally well dressed that she would only have been puzzled and perplexed by a greater power of choice  Whenever Mrs Chartres was disengaged she was sick and passed the day in bed but when she was fashionably dressed quite secure of a good dinner and an evening party at cards she felt the charm of existence could think of the evils of her own lot with resignation and of the evils of others with the most perfect equanimity  Mrs Chartres had a habit of laughing whenever she spoke Having therefore laughed at a storm of snow been no  less merry at the bad roads and found her son's awkwardness an equally good joke she told Charlotte and Julia with a titter that she would send them cards of invitation the next morning to meet a party at her house that day fortnight adding that she was sure they could yet have no engagements as they were but just come to town and that they would for ever oblige her by coming In vain these ladies assured her that they should prefer coming when she had no other visitors and that they liked conversation better than cards Mrs Chartres would no more  hear  a reason than she would have  given  one "on compulsion" and without paying the smallest attention to what they said continued to urge her request with such vehemence of entreaty that at length they yielded to her importunity and promised to come  As the morning was fine Julia got out of the carriage at Charlotte's door  and walked home In her way she saw a young bird that was unable to fly hopping on the pavement A boy seized it whom she bribed with a shilling to relinquish his prize which she was taking home when it escaped from her hand and fell down the area of a house She desired the servant who attended her to knock at the door and a search was made for the little fugitive but it could no where be found Julia wrote the following lines on this incident  ELEGY  On finding a young THRUSH in the Street who escaped from the Writer's Hand as she was bringing him home and falling down the Area of a House could not be found  MISTAKEN Bird ah whither hast thou stray'd  My friendly grasp why eager to elude  This hand was on thy pinion lightly laid  And fear'd to hurt thee by a touch too rude  Is there no foresight in a Thrush's breast  That thou down yonder gulph from me would'st go  That gloomy area lurking cats infest  And there the dog may rove alike thy foe  I would with lavish crumbs my Bird have fed  And bought a crystal cup to wet thy bill  I would have made of down and moss thy bed  Soft though not fashion'd with a Thrush's skill  Soon as thy strengthen'd wing could mount the sky  My willing hand had set my captive free  Ah not for her who loves the muse to buy  A selfish pleasure bought with pain to thee  The vital air and liberty and light  Had all been thine and love and rapt'rous song  And sweet parental joys in rapid flight  Had led the circle of thy life along  Securely to my window hadst thou flown  And ever thy accustom'd morsel found  Nor should thy trusting breast the wants have known  Which other Thrushes knew when winter frown'd  Fram'd with the wisdom Nature lent to thee  Thy house of straw had brav'd the tempest's rage  And thou thro' many a spring hadst liv'd to see  The utmost limit of a Thrush's age  Illfated Bird and does the Thrush's race  Like Man's mistake the path that leads to bliss  Or when his eye that tranquil path can trace  The good he well discerns thro' folly miss  CHAP XXII  THE Honourable Miss C  's waited on Julia a few days after her arrival in town profuse in professions of regard and eager to know if she meant to give many concerts and balls in the course of the winter Julia felt as much contempt for their present civilities as for their former neglect and received them with a degree of coldness by which they found that a plan of tender and romantic friendship intended to commence that very morning was not likely to succeed  These ladies talked much to Julia of the fashionable amusements mingling with great address instruction with entertainment and while they informed her what  every body of a certain fortune  did  obliquely hinted what she ought to  do  Julia forced herself to hearken to their remarks but the moment the Miss C  's left the room she forgot their existence nor did she recollect that there was any such thing as gaiety in the worldher whole thoughts being absorbed by the observations she had made on Frederick Seymour's behaviour since her arrival in town She saw him struggling with illconcealed wretchedness she bitterly reproached herself for her weakness on the first day of their meeting and endeavoured to atone for it to her own mind by avoiding all particular conversation with him most carefully She perceived that he now no longer exerted that resolution which had formerly led him to shun her society but that on the contrary he always attended his wife when she visited her father and was always at home when Julia was expected  He seemed unable to refuse himself the indulgence of seeing her and when they parted he was only occupied by the consideration when they should meet again for he found that the charms of her conversation soothed his unhappiness and that the tumult of his feelings was often calmed in her presence His disturbed mind resembled a tempestuous flood whose waves arise dark and turbulent except where the sunbeam throws a line of trembling radiance across their agitated surface  When the evening arrived on which Mrs Chartres's cardassembly was to take place Charlotte called upon Julia and the two ladies went together Mrs Chartres's room could not hold four cardtables without some inconvenience to the company but unluckily the point of her ambition was  five  Her aspiring mind preferred grandeur to ease She felt a noble contempt of difficulties  when her aim was glory and as she thought that five cardtables filled with welldressed persons was a very sublime  coup d'oeil  she contrived to place them with such masterly arrangement that not one inch of ground was lost There was also a lootable in an adjoining room or rather closet round which the company had just sufficient space to sit with their chairs close to the wainscot One of the cardtables in the large room was so near the door that the candle placed next to it blew out every time the door was shut or opened Mrs Chartres regretted that the wind was high but then her five cardtables had a fine effect "and it is so easy" thought she "to light a candle and besides who knows but the wind may fall"  Charlotte and Julia arrived before Mrs Chartres had adjusted all her cardtables and gained admittance with  some difficulty Mrs Chartres pushed through the crowd to receive them and having a very small space to move in by a swing of her arms which she thought fashionable she overturned a candlestick which stood on a cardtable in her way and set fire to her gauze apron Many screams and much confusion ensued but the flame was soon happily extinguished and after lamenting for some time the depredations of fire on gauze aprons she left that fierce element to itself and returned to the duties of the evening She told Charlotte and Julia "That she would not ask them to sit down till the cardtables were fixed when they would obtain a good seat" They stood for a considerable time but at length perceiving there was little chance of the ceremonies being adjusted and finding themselves much incommoded by the sudden and frequent movements of Mrs Chartres  and her son whom she repeatedly ordered to be alert and who often met her in midway and ran against her in all directions Charlotte and Julia procured a seat for themselves and had leisure to contemplate the scene before them It seemed as if the art of receiving company consisted in perpetual motion Mrs Chartres flew from one part of the room to the other without intermission enquired in the hurry of her task if those guests were cold whose faces were scorched by being placed too close to a large fire and hoped Julia found the room warm who was seated with her back against a door which was perpetually opening while she was almost frozen by a blast which issued from it Neither enquiry on the part of Mrs Chartres or complaint on that of Julia could serve any purpose The company were packed for the evening and no person could move without causing a general disturbance  One cardtable was still vacant and the task of making up another whistparty remained yet unperformed The attack was begun on a Mrs Sanford who at first absolutely refused to play but at length overcome by the steady perseverance of Mrs Chartres she gave her reluctant consent  After lavishing much eloquence Mrs Chartres prevailed on three other persons to make up the party who had before refused to play Some time was spent in settling the price and when this was done Mrs Sanford who had retired to a corner of the room was told the party waited for her But Mrs Sanford who had by this time gained sufficient fortitude to sustain another siege resolutely refused to play The attack however was renewed with fresh vigour and poor Mrs Sanford at last yielded to its violence The party was settled and Mrs Chartres relieved  from this load of anxiety found leisure for a little conversation with such of the company as would not be enlisted in the service of the cardtable though she felt much indignation at their refractory conduct She now rejoiced that one lady had escaped coldhoped her neighbour on the right had escaped tooand regretted that her on the left was still hoarse Then she enumerated all her own complaintsexpatiated on her weak nervesand afterwards by a very easy transition passed from bodily to mental evils lamenting that she had had nothing but illluck the whole winter and that she had lost three crowns a night and declaring that her best fortune was never more than five small trumps without one king or queen Mrs Chartres expected to awaken general sympathy in her losses but she forgot that there is more distress in the world than pity and that the world cannot afford to waste any of its little  stock upon five small trumps She then complained how much company had disappointed her and told Charlotte she had received twenty apologies that morning A little while after she related to another lady the same circumstance with the addition of ten more excuses and when Frederick Seymour arrived complained to him how ill her acquaintances had behaved "For no less than forty cards of apology" said she "have I received this morning" "The men in buckram will soon be here" said Charlotte "I cannot help thinking" rejoined Seymour in a low voice "that these forty excuses were welltimed unless Mrs Chartres could adopt Milton's plan with the evil spirits and by some commodious transformation suit the dimensions of her company to those of her apartment"  Mrs Chartres soon after told Julia in the confidence of friendship that her  old uncle was dead "But I only received the account last night" said she "and it would have been so much trouble to forbid all the company that I thought I would let them come and keep it a secretdon't tell"  Tea was brought by Thomas a young countryman who had enlisted in one of the newraised regiments but having been in a short time discharged because his size was below the military standard he had entered into the service of Mrs Chartres His figure was squat his shoulders broad and high and his livery somewhat oldfashioned with a profusion of buttons and long waistcoat pockets and upon the whole he bore a very striking resemblance to Mr Parsons in the entertainment of High Life above Stairs It was easy to perceive that Thomas had been accustomed to march by beat of drum and though in the exercise of his present peaceable profession  he wore no defiance in his aspect but on the contrary hung down his head and looked meek as a lamb yet his military step still rendered him formidable He presented the teacups in the same abrupt manner in which he had been taught to present his firelock and Julia being unprepared for these martial movements a cup of tea was spilt on her gown Thomas's face became like scarlet at this accident Mrs Chartres scolded loudly and declared she believed it would be impossible to cure him of his awkward ways "Then" said she "he blunders for ever I never knew him once do right he brings me into such scrapesI ordered him a month ago to leave two tickets at Mrs C  's and Mrs N  's which he thought proper to forget and now Mrs C  is gone to the EastIndies and Mrs N  is deadhow provoking Mrs Chartres's  discourse did not proceed without interruption for whenever a knock was heard at the streetdoor she instantly started from her seat obliged the company to make way and stationed herself at the door of the apartment where she paid her compliments to her visitors before she suffered them to pass the threshold and where for the most part she stood a considerable time in expectation Thomas being so unwilling to leave the company above to admit those who were waiting in their carriages below that his mistress was more than once compelled to remind him of his duty by a push on the shoulder  The rubber being now finished at the table where Mrs Sanford had been compelled to sit down she came to Mrs Chartres to know who was to cut in "I know of nobody" said Mrs Chartres with great composure "you must play on" At this moment Frederick  Seymour who had been called away returned fortunately for Mrs Sanford who instantly quitted the table Seymour had little inclination to play He however came prepared to do penance and being convinced like other votaries of mortification that his merit would be great in proportion as his sensations were disagreeable he quietly seated himself at whist  A young man now entered the room foppishly dressed and casting a look of selfimportance around the company he advanced with a sauntering step to Mrs Chartres and apologized for his sister's not coming who he said was detained by two friends that had just arrived from the country "La" said Mrs Chartres "I wish she had come and brought her two friends with her they would have helped to fill up the room" "You are very good Ma'am" replied Mr Burton "upon my word we never  thought of that" He then turned to speak to an acquaintance and Mrs Chartres took that opportunity of informing Julia that she had asked Mr Burton on purpose to meet her for "I know" said she "you are a great reader so I thought you would like him for I do assure you he's vastly clever and knows all about Cicero and Hume's History of England" By this time the connoisseur in Cicero having finished his compliments returned to Mrs Chartres's circle and placing himself next to Julia asked her if she had seen the new play" She said she had not "I'm surprized at that Ma'am" rejoined Mr Burton "I assure you every body likes it" "Well I really long to go" said Mrs Chartres with her usual laugh "but Mrs Smith has been so much engaged that she could not take me and I have no notion of going to the play in a hack and coming into  the boxes with the straw about one's petticoats as if one had just escaped from Bedlam To be sure I might have gone a fortnight ago to the new play but they would only give us a second row and at the other house they gave us a first so I thought the difference of the play didn't signify much" "And pray what was the play you saw Ma'am" enquired Mr Burton "Macbeth" replied Mrs Chartres "I declare I was quite disappointed for I had never seen it before and I had a notion Lady Macbeth was a good sort of woman and there is such wickedness going on and so many extravagant fancies" Mrs Chartres concluded as she had begun with a laugh and then made her way to another part of the room  Meantime Mr Burton intreated Julia to join the party at loo declaring that he was sure she would win and he  would bet any sum upon her cards When he found she was inflexible in her determination not to play he endeavoured to entertain her while he displayed his own knowledge of fashionable life by talking of the public places particularly the theatre and by discussing at large the merits of the different actors and actresses only interrupting his criticism to give her a significant wink at the manner in which Thomas presented the lemonade Julia quite disgusted with his vulgar and impertinent familiarity rose to change her seat which was a matter of some difficulty Placing herself near three young ladies who were dressed in the utmost extreme of the fashion she endeavoured to avoid Mr Burton's assiduity who followed her with officious gallantry by entering into conversation with these ladies but she found herself wholly unqualified for the task Their  conversation consisted entirely of anecdotes of the nobility and minute details of all that had lately past in the great world In vain however did these ladies attempt to dazzle and awe each other by the rank and importance of their respective friends for if one mentioned an incident which had happened to her friend Lady such a one the other young ladies immediately recollected some circumstance as well worth relating of a friend of equal rank  Frederick Seymour now left the cardtable where he had been scolded the whole time he played by his partner a little fat woman above forty with a pert countenance and a manner still more pert than her physiognomy who kept herself in pocketmoney by cards and was eagleeyed to the smallest deviation from what she thought the rules of the game She and Seymour gained the first rubber One of their opponents  happened to have no silver and while she was trying to get change the other laid down a crown to Seymour which his partner instantly snatched up saying that the other lady should pay Mr Seymour for she herself was so apt to forget After cutting for partners she was again Seymour's lot and they soon lost double the sum they had gained When Seymour left the table Mrs Chartres enquiring if he had won he said "he had no subject of satisfaction but the success of others" His disagreeable partner now joined their circle affected to talk of her illluck with indifference and began sympathizing with Mrs Chartres who again brought forward her own bad fortune "I observe" said Seymour to Julia "that people are at as much pains to display their feelings on occasions when they feel nothing as to hide them at cards when they are losing their money  and really feel a great deal" Mrs Chartres watched her opportunity and while she fancied herself unobserved could not resist moving towards the cardtable which Seymour had quitted and gently lifting the candlestick to see if the cardmoney had been duly remembered Being satisfied of this she came up to Julia and complained of her not calling upon her in a morning "I seldom pay morning visits" said Julia "Oh I know you're always reading" said Mrs Chartres "I suppose you shut yourself up at home aren't you charm'd with the Pangs of Sensibility" "Is that the title of a book" said Julia "La why is it possible you haven't read the new novel the Pangs of Sensibility" "No indeed I have not" answered Julia "Well I'm so surprized Nor you Mrs Seymour not read the Pangs of Sensibility" "No" "Nor have you never heard of it  Mr Seymour" "I must acknowledge my ignorance of the book" said Seymour "whatever imputation it may be upon my taste" "Oh pray do buy it" resumed Mrs Chartres "it will only cost you six shillings and its so excessively pretty but the end's very dismal" "Well" said Seymour "I shall be prepared for the worst and you may depend upon it we will have six shillingsworth of sensibility tomorow morning"  Thomas now announced Mrs Seymour's carriage not by coming forward and telling her the agreeable tidings in a low voice as is usual but having collected all his courage in coming up stairs he opened the door and with a firm countenance called out as loud as he could Mrs Seymour's carriage  ready  which last word he pronounced so short and quick and in such an elevated tone that it had the effect  of an electrical shock and no person of weak nerves could hear it without starting Charlotte rose instantly and was hastening away with great alacrity but she found this a more difficult enterprize than she imagined Mrs Chartres seized both her hands declared she must not go so soon assured her it was very early a hundred times in a breath and gathering fresh courage as she proceeded at length in a most authoritative tone insisted upon her staying Although unprepared for so violent an attack Charlotte when she had recovered her surprize assigned a reason for going which she thought unanswerable she told Mrs Chartres "that she made it a rule not to keep her servants and horses in waiting in bad weather" "La" said Mrs Chartres "why your servants can come into the house and as for the horses you told me two of your's were sick  and you had job horses so why need you care about their waiting since they are not your own" Charlotte answered "that indeed  that  reason had never occurred to her but though the horses are  not  my own" said she with some emphasis "I must be gone this moment" and she was again hastening away when Mrs Chartres suddenly placed herself between her and the door declared that she had prepared a supper below for a small select party expatiated on the cruelty of refusing to stay this once when her supper was prepared and then petitioned implored and persecuted till she wrung from the distressed Charlotte her slow consent to send away the carriage for an hour  The chosen party which Mrs Chartres distinguished by an invitation to supper waited a considerable time after the rest of the company were dispersed  before the repast was announced Mrs Chartres had not proportioned the number of her guests to the size of her table which was so crouded that the company were obliged to sit sideways and whenever a plate was changed or a dish removed to give way by general consent But these inconveniences Mrs Chartres perceived with perfect indifference and only lamented that she could not prevail on more of her friends to stay She heard with equal composure the vain applications which were made to Thomas for plates knives and forks Thomas when called upon answered "Yes" with great alertness but as nothing can come of nothing it was entirely out of his power to supply the demands of the company All that wisdom could suggest or promptitude atchieve Thomas performed When desired to bring desert spoons of which there were none  in the house he presented teaspoons and when called upon for oil an article which in the hurry of preparation had been forgotten he produced vinegar by way of substitute  Mr Burton had taken care to place himself next Julia to whom he devoted his whole attention and begged to have the honour of helping her to some chicken enquiring what part she chose She desired a wing "Well I declare" said Mr Burton "that surprizes me I think a leg so much better I believe I have a strange taste but I like the legs of all fowls better than the wings I even prefer the drumstick of a turkey" Julia made him no answer as it was a point she felt not the least inclination to discuss After supper there was much loud merriment for the company in general seemed to be of opinion that mirth and noise were synonymous terms and gaiety merely a  counterfeit unless it was powerful enough to disturb the neighbourhood When the party became a little fatigued with this vociferous conviviality Mr Burton in order as he declared "to keep it up" volunteered a song in the Italian manner but in a voice that scorned all tune and with so many strange cadences that Charlotte who was in good spirits found it extremely difficult to avoid laughing Mr Burton however was so perfectly satisfied with his own performance that when the song was finished he looked round to collect the applause of his audience He then proposed sentimental toasts which he said he liked of all things among clever people but Charlotte's carriage was now announced who impatient to be gone hastened away with too quick a pace to be again stopped Julia followed as fast as she could happy to  leave the ladies who were in friendship with the nobility and escorted to the carriage by the gentleman who knew so much about Cicero and had such a taste for the drumsticks of turkies Frederick Seymour hastened after the ladies but they could scarcely be convinced they had escaped till they were out of the house for Mrs Chartres pursued them along the passage with repeated wishes that they might not get cold repeated thanks for their company and a thousand "goodnights" till they were quite out of hearing  In their way home Charlotte laughed heartily at the recollection of all that had passed while Julia declared she thought the evening the longest she had ever spent Seymour expressed his indignation at the horrible penance he had undergone and all of them agreed never to make such a sacrifice of time again  Mrs Chartres on the contrary dismissed her guests with much selfcomplacency She had given a cardassembly and a  petitsouper  and had not sufficient penetration to discern that her sketch of elegance was a wretched daub and though it was copied from what she had heard of highlife had as little resemblance to its model as the picture of King William on a signpost to the real features of the hero it represents When the company departed Mrs Chartres told her son with an air of triumph that the evening had  gone off  remarkably well Chartres was by no means of opinion that the evening had gone off  well  but that it was gone at last was to him a most comfortable reflection to whom it had produced nothing but confusion perspiration and distress  CHAP XXIV  MRS Melbourne and Mr and Mrs Seymour who had been some weeks at Bath arrived in town and soon after Mrs Melbourne took an opportunity to repeat what she had already more than once insinuated to Mr Clifford that Julia was incapable of the management of his family and that he ought to watch her narrowly and limit her expences It may seem strange that Mrs Melbourne took the trouble to interest herself in Mr Clifford's family affairs but she had no less than two motives for this conduct Since Julia was the age of seventeen this lady had had a standing quarrel  with her on account of her beauty and though she had patched up a reconciliation on Mrs Seymour's marriage her former animosity revived when she saw Julia mistress of her uncle's house and living in greater splendor than her own daughter But independently of this parental jealousy Mrs Melbourne was a person who often intermeddled in the concerns of other people merely as an exercise for the activity of her own mind She had the highest opinion of her own penetration was fond of command wished to be the directing star of all her acquaintances and distributed counsel admonition and reproof with infinite liberality There is however a remarkable difference in the value placed upon advice by those who give and those who receive it and Mrs Melbourne's tutelar care of Mr Clifford's household met with so cold a reception from that gentleman that she  determined to deprive him of the benefit of her instructions in future  Mrs Seymour soon invited Julia to a party at her house where her chief amusement arose from the observations she made on Charles Seymour's behaviour She could guess the rank or fortune of the persons with whom he conversed with as much precision as if she had read their names in the Court Calendar or had learnt from their broker the state of their funds for had the title or wealth of each of his acquaintances been weighed in one scale and the degree of his attention in another the counterpoise would have been found exactly even without one grain of courtesy one atom of kindness being wasted or misplaced If the rule of his conduct had been somewhat more noble nothing could have been more praiseworthy than his diligent adherence to it which was uniform and undeviating  neither relaxed by tenderness or moved by admiration Politeness in him was the offspring not of benevolence but of selfishness and though he laboured to conceal its hereditary likeness under the mask of ostentatious urbanity and studied candor yet some lurking meanness or insolent neglect occasionally betrayed to persons of penetration its ignoble origin  He devoted half an hour in the course of the evening to Julia which was certainly half an hour lost both to her and to himself though he was gay and tender witty and pathetic by turns muttered sighed and smiled and repeated those flattering things to which he was well convinced no woman could listen with indifference when they proceeded from his lips When he thought Julia had heard enough to be almost seriously in love with the speaker to prevent that mischief he sauntered to  the youngest Miss C  who was sitting at some distance with a very grave countenance but when she saw him approaching her features became more gay every step he advanced and she was so sprightly by the time he drew near that she received him with an encouraging titter which she honoured his wit by renewing at proper intervals  Meantime Frederick Seymour wholly absorbed by Julia played at whist without knowing a card in his hand and followed her with his eye wherever she moved He saw her conversing with Mr F  observed that she seemed to have pleasure in the conversation and that she smiled upon him with great sweetness and while he meditated with horror on the satisfaction expressed in her countenance he finished the rubber very expeditiously by making some capital mistakes He paid his losses with great alacrity and hastened to Mr  F  whom he engaged in conversation but he had no power to detain Julia and she left her seat in a few minutes Seymour did not dare to follow and while he was employed in watching her movements entirely forgot that he was conversing with Mr F  till that gentleman left him and hastened to the party of ladies whom Julia had joined Frederick Seymour now perceived that in quitting the whisttable he had only procured for himself a change of misery again Mr F spoke and again Julia listened In vain Seymour endeavoured to witness this second conversationscene with composurein vain he struggled to suppress his sensationsit was a thing impossible "Ah who can hold a fire in his hand by thinking of the frosty Caucasus" Seymour in a fit of despair went to Charlotte told her he was going to pay a visit and hastened away But by the  time he reached the street door he heartily repented having left the room He fancied he saw Julia rejoicing in his absence and Mr F  happy in her smiles He wished to find some excuse for returning but the present agitation of his mind was not favourable to invention and he was at last reduced to hope that his horses feet might slip his carriage break down and that some kind disaster might furnish him with a pretence to go back But while these things were passing in his mind his coachman conducted him in perfect fafety to his own door He hastened to his study but with no intention to read walked up and down the room then flung himself into a chair then walked again listened to every carriage that passed thought Charlotte would never return reflected how much time Mr F  had had for conversation and was little comforted when Charlotte appeared  and told him she had left her father and Julia behind as his carriage was not come Seymour was surprised Mr Clifford chose to stay so late wondered Charlotte did not offer to set him down and desired to know what company she left behind Charlotte mentioned several names but omitted Mr F  and Seymour was obliged to ask if he was gone when she came away "Oh no" said Charlotte "I beg Mr F  's pardon I declare I quite forgot him and I wonder at that for I left him talking to Julia" Seymour rose hastily from his seat and walked two or three times across the room He then enquired at what hour Mrs Seymour's parties generally broke up and gained no information Meantime Charlotte grew somewhat tired of her husband's interrogatories "Yet" thought she "it is easy to repeat a few names and answer a few questions and though  I find them a little dull because I am sleepy I am glad he is amused"  At length however when Seymour again renewed the subject of Mr F  "Do my dear Mr Seymour" said Charlotte "let me bid that worthy gentleman good night and we'll have him served up at breakfast tomorrow morning" Charlotte went to sleep as unconscious of the pain she had inflicted by her intelligence respecting Mr F  as a child who sports with images of death and prattles about the tall feathers of the hearse to the afflicted mourner who feels every syllable a wound  Julia though she had conversed with Mr F  with apparent cheerfulness felt no such sensation at her heart She had perceived Frederick Seymour's jealousy and perturbation and trembled lest his unhappy passion should be discovered and spread a wider circle of  misery She found some relief after he was gone in conversing with Mr Seymour who saw she was in bad spirits and exerted his brilliant talents for her entertainment He had a high place in her esteem She respected his abilities was charmed with his conversation and sometimes secretly lamented that he was not united to a woman more capable of conferring domestic happiness But an incident happened which totally altered her opinion of his character  Mr Clifford hired a housekeeper on the recommendation of an old friend of his to whom she had been long known This person had only been a few days in Mr Clifford's family when she acknowledged to Julia that she had lived many years with Mr Seymour's mother and that she had only left Mr Seymour's service one year Julia enquired into the reason of her quitting it "Ah Ma'am" said she "it  was because I was too honest and loved that poor dear young lady Mrs Meynell too well" "Who is Mrs Meynell" enquired Julia "Have you never heard of her Ma'am" "No never" She then related to Julia that Mrs Meynell's mother who was the daughter of a Scotch Lord married her father's chaplain a Mr Forbes Her family renounced her and her brother who soon after succeeded to the title would never hear her name Her husband died some years after their marriage and Mrs Forbes was so much afflicted at his death that she fell into a consumption and soon followed him to the grave leaving one daughter Several years before Mrs Forbes's marriage her eldest sister had married Mr Seymour an English gentleman who was the father of the present Mr Seymour Upon the death of Mrs Forbes Mrs Seymour who was then  a widow took her orphan child under her own protection "She was just seven years old Ma'am" said the housekeeper to Julia "when she came to my mistress and she had so many engaging ways Ma'am that she soon won all our hearts Pretty creature she would sit and talk of her poor mama by the hour together "To be sure she would say my aunt is very good to me but I suppose Mrs Evans an aunt never loves one like a mama" "My dear" says I "your aunt will be a mama to you now" "Yes" says she "my aunt said so yesterday and told me I might call her mama if I pleased and so I shall but for all that she's not my own true mama that was put into the coffin" "Poor little soul I remember very well going into the room one day and the child was standing at the window crying so says I What are you crying for my dear says I"  "Nothing Mrs Evans only" and she sobbed "only that black coach that went by put me in mind of my mama I was thinking how she kissed me the last time before she died and I remember every word mama said She took me in her arms and held me  so  fast and said My poor childmy sweet darlingmust I leave youGod Almighty bless you my poor orphan and then she said something more about the fatherlessand then my mama  cried  so Mrs Evansand I cried very much indeedPray Mrs Evans what made my mama call me poor child I'm not  poor  you know I have frocks enough and a new black sash and yet every body that comes to see my aunt kisses me and says Poor little thing But  I  can guess why they call  me poor  it's because I have no mama and other little girls have a papa and mama too" "I could not  bear to hear her innocent prattle Ma'am it went to my very heart "Heavens bless you my love" said I "and keep you from all evil" "And pray Mrs Evans" said she "what is evil" "I wish you may never know" said I "But come my dear" says I "come into my room and I'll give you a great peach" "No I thank you Mrs Evans" says she "keep it for me till tomorrow if you please I shall like the peach best when I'm not thinking of my mama"  "Well Ma'am she grew up as one may say like a fine plant tall and straight and a very lovely creature she is she has something Ma'am of your mild look And so Ma'am as I was saying my mistress could not help being fond of her and gave her fine cloaths and took her every where a visiting with her"  Mrs Evans then informed Julia  that at the death of Mrs Seymour which happened when Miss Forbes was two and twenty she was left entirely destitute as Mrs Seymour had nothing but her jointure and it was not in her power to provide for her niece The young lady upon her aunt's death determined to go out in the world however unfit she felt herself to struggle with its difficulties But this measure Mr Seymour strenuously opposed informing her that he was going to be married in a few months to Miss Melbourne and intreating that she would still consider his house as her home He assured her of his utmost endeavours to make her situation happy and proposed that till his marriage took place she should board with a family of which he had some knowledge  "So Ma'am" continued Mrs Evans "she hardly knew what to do So  Ma'am I advised her to go till she could look about her so she went and as soon as ever Mr Seymour was married he invited her to his house but she said to me the night she came "says she Mrs Evans" says she "I am come here for a few weeks because Mr Seymour urged it with so much kindness that I could not well refuse But I am determined not to live in a state of dependance and shall only stay till I can provide myself with a proper situation" "Well Ma'am Mrs Seymour was prodigious civil to her at first but she soon behaved so disrespectful and so spiteful you can't think I believe in my conscience it was all  pure  envy because Miss Forbes was handsomer than herself for Ma'am Miss Forbes looks like a queen when she's dressed Mrs Seymour isn't fit to hold the candle to her So poor thing she used to complain Ma'am of ill health and never would  appear when there was company or go out with Mrs Seymour so Mrs Seymour kept it a secret she was in the house" "And where is she now" said Julia with eagerness "Why you shall hear Ma'am She was resolved to go out in the world but she couldn't hear of a situation directly so Mr Seymour told her she would make him miserable if she thought of it but if she disliked his family she should go and board where she was before so Ma'am she went till she could hear of a place Well Ma'am then he came every day to visit her on pretence to be sure that she was his cousin but at last Ma'am he had the assurance to make downright love to her So she sent for me all of a hurry and cried bitterly and told me of it for Ma'am though I should not say it myself I had always done my duty by her and she knew how I loved her and so she treated me like a friend So Ma'am there was a captain on halfpay  a Captain Meynell that visited where she was and had made proposals of marriage to her and it was said he had a good deal of money in the stocks and so the best advice I could give her was to take him for better for worse though to be sure he was a little rough and ugly enough God knows Well Ma'am she was half distracted and at last she consented to marry the Captain in despair as one may say So Ma'am Mr Seymour gave me leave to go and dress her wedding dinner and be with her and plague enough I had with their awkward servants to be sure There was a pretty dish of green pease overboiled that cost Mr Seymour a guinea for he sent them though she wou'dn't see him and a very handsome dish it was to give the devil his due There was a very good dinner to be sure for the matter of that I remember all the dishes I'm sure I had vexation enough the  ducklings were overroasted and that sweet creature cried so many a salt tear I shed with her I was so vexed about the ducklings I never met with such an accident before and many a pair have I sent up in my time roasted to a turn but then I had all my things proper about me Moreover Ma'am" says I "what does it argufy" says I "taking on so now when the deed's done but poor soul she only cried the more for that She was dressed all in white Ma'am and as plain as could be but she looked charmingly for all that Well Ma'am she wanted to go directly and live in the country to hide herself from the world as she called it but do you know Ma'am that monster my master for a monster he is to be sure persuaded her husband who is but thickheaded to stay in London and he would get him some place or another but all he wanted was to keep  her here for his own vile ends And now Ma'am he's always going there on pretence of seeing Captain Meynell but she takes on so I believe she'll fret herself to death soon" "Where does she live" said Julia "Why Ma'am in a little miserable sort of a lodging in Charlesstreet Westminster I'm sure I little thought for to see her come to that and I believe she often goes without her dinner for it turned out that Captain Meynell had no money at all and only married her in hopes that her great friends would provide for him and I believe Ma'am Mr Seymour knew well enough he was poor when she married him but he wanted to get her more into his own clutches Well Ma'am and Mrs Seymour goes sometimes to see her but its only to vaunt over her Oh Ma'am it sets my blood up so when I think of it So one day I gave  it to Mr Seymour pretty roundly for all his doings and told him a piece of my mind And "Sir" says I "I should expect a curse Sir" says I "would come upon me if I eat your bread any longer and I desired to be paid my wages and went off that very night" Julia was now called away but Mrs Evans's narrative had made a deep impression on her mind She determined to get acquainted with Mrs Meynell and felt a generous impatience to foften her misfortunes by administering all the comfort which her unhappy situation would admit With respect to Mr Seymour she felt that severe disappointment which is experienced by an ardent and ingenuous mind when it is forced to exchange the fervent glow of esteem and confidence for disgust and aversion and when finding itself grossly deceived in its opinions of another it is led with painful regret to lower its general standard of human excellence  She lamented that Mr Seymour's character which appeared open liberal and elevated should so ill bear a close inspection and that his mind resembled one of those pictures which must be viewed by the dim light of a taper since their coarse and glaring colours which attract the eye in the deceitful medium shrink from the full and clear sunshine of truth  But while Julia's heart throbbed with indignation at the oppressor and melted with compassion for the oppressed she fancied she saw the arm of indignant Heaven tearing the veil by which iniquity was concealed and making manifest the sufferings of innocence And while she hoped to act as the agent of Providence in protecting afflicted virtue she exulted in the strengthened conviction that evil like a baleful meteor has its appointed course and then must set in darkness  CHAP XXV  JULIA felt all the eagerness of ardent benevolence to become acquainted with Mrs Meynell and to endeavour by every effort in her power to alleviate her misfortunes She determined to wait upon her immediately but had too much respect for her unhappy situation to visit her without the customary forms of introduction  She hastened to Charlotte impatient to be informed if she had any knowledge of Mrs Meynell and anxious to solve a most painful doubt which arose in her mind left Frederick Seymour should be capable of deserting his amiable relation because she was unfortunate A doubt of those in whose integrity we  have confided in whose virtue we are interested is a situation of mind the most gloomy and comfortless Suspicion is like a mist which renders the object it shades so uncertain that the figure must be finished by imagination and when distrust takes the pencil the strokes are generally so dark that the disappointed heart sickens at the picture  Julia related to Charlotte the circumstances which Mrs Evans had told her concerning Mrs Meynell concealing however her account of Mr Seymour's criminal designs which she thought it was improper to communicate to any one Charlotte told her that she had frequently heard Frederick Seymour speak of Mrs Meynell with the most affectionate concern "We have scarcely had a moment's  téteàtéte  " said Charlotte "since you came to town or I should certainly have  mentioned to you what I had heard of her Mr Seymour has often told me how much he was shocked at his return from the continent to find her married to such a man as Captain Meynell and he has visited her three or four times since we came to town but she will not allow him to bring me to wait upon her He says he is sure that Mrs Seymour has been insolent to her and I suppose she apprehends the same treatment from me I cannot intrude upon her against her consent but I hope she will be persuaded to see me in time" "But my dear Charlotte" rejoined Julia "we will not wait these slow determinations She has not forbidden  me  to come and I will go directly to Mrs Seymour oblige her to introduce me to Mrs Meynell and then bring you together at my uncle's" Julia earnest in her project without farther deliberation called  upon Mrs Seymour and enquired if she had an hour of leisure that morning Mrs Seymour assured her that she was quite disengaged and vastly happy to see her  Since the period of Mr Clifford's return from the East Mrs Seymour had behaved to Julia with the utmost cordiality as she now thought her acquaintance eligible though she could feel no friendship for a woman so handsome for Mrs Seymour was not like the world in general attracted by "a set of features or the tincture of a skin" but on the contrary felt a generous affection for deformity She was sensible however that her taste was singular and she therefore concealed it carefully After many expressions of kindness on the part of Mrs Seymour and some general conversation Julia led to the subject of her visit by mentioning that Mrs Evans was now Mr Clifford's  housekeeper Mrs Seymour changed colour at this intelligence "That's strange enough" said she "pray who recommended her""An old friend of Mr Clifford's""Well I am sure" added Mrs Seymour with affected carelessness "you will not keep her long She is a most forward impertinent creature and had been so spoilt by Mr Seymour's mother that I found myself obliged to part with her" "There is  one  circumstance however" said Julia looking stedfastly at Mrs Seymour "which gives me a favourable opinion of her her strong attachment to Mrs Meynell" "O yes" replied Mrs Seymour in manifest confusion "she's a poor relation of Mr Seymour's" "I wonder I never heard you mention her name" rejoined Julia "Why really" said Mrs Seymour "I thought it very unnecessary to teaze you with a long history of Mr  Seymour's relations" "But I think Mrs Meynell's story so interesting and the accounts I have heard of her from Evans have prepossessed me so strongly in her favour that I feel a great desire for her acquaintance and the purpose of my visit this morning is to ask you to come with me and introduce me to her" "Bless me my dear Miss Clifford" said Mrs Seymour with apparent chagrin "what a strange whimwhat in the world can you have to do with Mrs Meynell" "I have no other reason" said Julia calmly "for desiring her acquaintance than that her character and situation interest me But come why should we waste time in talking of our visit Mr Clifford's carriage is at the door I suppose you often call on Mrs Meynell and there will be nothing very singular in taking me with you" "Oh my dear" said Mrs Seymour "you don't know what confusion the sight of  a new carriage will create It will shake Mrs Meynell's nerves for a fortnight she'll be flying into her bedroom to tie on a clean apron and come to us in such a tremble" "  That  will give me pain indeed" said Julia "I assure you" rejoined Mrs Seymour "going there is the most distressing thing in the world I was made so ill last time I went by an unlucky circumstanceYou must know she lodges at a taylor's and the men work in the garret so the last time I called her little girl of a servant was out of the way and a sour illlooking fellow opened the door and when my servant enquired if Mrs Meynell was at home answered "Yes" and walked away So I got out of the carriage and was going up stairs for I knew it was in vain to wait for any body to announce me and just as I reached the first landingplace I met five or six men coming with a shocking noise  down stairs It really struck me that they were a gang of thieves who had plundered the house and were making off I believe I gave a sort of scream but they stopped and made way for me very respectfully and who should these people be but the men who work in the garret coming down to dinner However when I reached Mrs Meynell I was so ill with the fright that I was forced to call for a glass of water I waited a great while for it for she was obliged to get it herself and when I told her the reason of my being indisposed she was so sullen that she would scarcely speak while I stayed I suppose she very goodnaturedly thought there was something of affectation in my fright Because she is used to this formidable troop herself she fancied that there was nothing in it to alarm  me  "  "Well" said Julia "I am not at  all deterred by your rencounter from wishing to visit Mrs Meynell and feel more disposed to pity than blame her sullenness on the occasion you mention" "If you  will  go" said Mrs Seymour with some asperity "you  must  and if you find the acquaintance troublesome remember its your own fault" She then rung the bell for her maid ordered with much illhumour her cloak and gloves and set off with Julia in Mr Clifford's carriage Mrs Seymour was extremely sullen the whole way and when Julia spoke to her only answered by monosyllables till they drew near the door when she advised Julia to take care to hold up her gown while she went up stairs or she would probably have her train tolerably dirtied from the feet of the workmen  Julia found that though Mrs Meynell's lodgings were mean and such as  bespoke extreme penury the dirt and confusion of which Mrs Seymour complained were violently exaggerated but notwithstanding this the habitation appeared utterly unfit for the inhabitant She seemed like a finely proportioned statue the exquisite workmanship of Grecian hands which those masters of art would have deemed worthy to inhabit a temple and decorate a shrine but which Gothic barbarity had placed in a rude and sordid hut where it lay neglected by those who were ignorant of its value Mrs Meynell was about twentyfour years of age her figure was tall graceful and elegant her countenance with a considerable degree of beauty had a strong expression of melancholy and there was a dignity in her manner which commanded respect even from those who were unfeeling enough to refuse it to her situation She had heard much of Julia's  goodness from the old housekeeper who had been to visit her since her residence in Mr Clifford's house and though Mrs Meynell was unable to account for Julia's visit she was charmed with the sweetness of her manner and conversed with her with evident pleasure When Mrs Seymour rose to take leave Julia gave Mrs Meynell a card with her direction and requested to see her in a manner which shewed how much she wished it Mrs Meynell promised to wait upon her and the ladies departed  Captain Meynell did not appear during their visit but we will give a short sketch of his character He was about the middle size thin and rather genteel in his figure but his manners were disgusting and his person usually dirty His mind was a strange compound of pride and meanness He was continu+ally boasting of his wife's family and  was not a little proud of his own which was also respectable but which he himself disgraced He behaved with the most abject meanness to all those who he thought could serve him yet at times when he fancied himself neglected or ill used his brutality suddenly burst forth and by a reproof which had more of rudeness than satire he defeated the servile practices of years and was generally dismissed with disgrace His sullenness which was extreme nothing could conquer but his insatiable curiosity which led him to make the most minute enquiries into the private history of his acquaintances Such anecdotes he retailed with the greatest avidity and often occasioned much mischief by so doing He had as strong an affection for Mrs Meynell as he was capable of feeling He had married her merely with a view to secure Mr Seymour's good offices who had been lavish  in his promises of service being earnest from the worst motives to promote this illassorted union But though Captain Meynell had no views in marrying but those of interest his wife's sweetness of temper exemplary resignation and uniform submission to his will had awakened every spark of tenderness in his bosom and led him to feel a sincere wish to make her happy yet his sordid meanness vulgarity and illhumour continually frustrated that desire His ferocious nature was softened but not subdued and his varying humours only produced to his unhappy wife "variety of wretchedness" She was either wearied with his mirth disgusted by his fondness shocked by his meanness or wounded by his brutality  In her way from Mrs Meynell's Julia expressed in the warmest terms her admiration of that lady to whose  praises Mrs Seymour reluctantly assented Julia returned home exulting in plans of future benevolence She found Mr Clifford at home and Frederick Seymour with him She told them that Mrs Seymour had introduced her to Mrs Meynell and declared how much she was pleased with that lady's conversation and manners While they were conversing on this subject Mr Clifford was called out of the room and Frederick Seymour who had listened to the history of her visit with delighted attention exclaimed with warmth "I am not ignorant Miss Clifford of the generous motives which have prompted you to make this visit for I have just had a conference with my old friend Mrs Evans who told me she had made you acquainted with Mrs Meynell's misfortunes" "She is infinitely to be pitied" replied Julia "But she will henceforth be less unhappy"  rejoined Seymour "for she will possess  your  sympathy she will be blessed with  your  friendship and the evils which are soothed by such consolation are more to be envied than deplored" "It is later than I imagined" said Julia looking at her watch "I must go and dress for dinner" "Ah Miss Clifford" resumed he passionately "must then the indulgence of conversing with you for a moment be for ever denied me What have I said of what have I been guilty to merit this severityAlas Madam far from daring to utter a sentiment unfit for you to hear I have been lamenting the miseries of another at the very moment when the acute sensation of my own wretchedness almost deadens every feeling of sympathy in vain I have struggled to subdue that obstinate wretchedness""Why Sir" said Julia interrupting him "will you force me to fly from you by using a language which  I cannot hear without indignation" While she was hastening out of the room he exclaimed "But one moment" "No Sir not a moment" She then left him and when she reached her own apartment forgot her intention to dress and only thought of that look of despondency with which Seymour saw her depart Soon however rouzing herself from this dangerous meditation she dressed and hastened into company determined to allow herself not a moment more for the indulgence of reflection which she was conscious in her present state of mind was but another name for the indulgence of sorrow  Seymour remained for some time after Julia had left the room in a state of misery not to be described Passionately as he loved her he had no desire but that of seeing of conversing with her of possessing a place in her esteem and friendship He had the highest respect  for her character nor ever suffered himself to harbour a wish inconsistent with the purity of her heart and the rectitude of her principles He was therefore filled with remorse and anguish when he reflected that by the weak indulgence of complaints in her presence he had justly incurred her resentment and perhaps by wounding her delicacy robbed himself of that share of her pity and regard which was the sole alleviation of his misery He left Mr Clifford's house in the utmost perturbation of mind and returned home disconsolate and wretched Seymour in vain possessed distinguished talents and was placed in a situation which opened a splendid and honourable career for his abilities Absorbed by his unfortunate feelings those talents were useless and those advantages were lost His mind resembled a finetoned instrument whose extensive compass  was capable of producing the most sublime and elevating sounds but a fatal pressure relaxed the strings and sunk its powerful harmony  The ardent enthusiastic spirit of this young man was susceptible of the strongest and most lasting impressions How carefully therefore should he have guarded against the weak indulgence of that imperious passion which on such a temper produces the most fatal effects and subdues all energy of soul In vain would that spark of divinity within us pursue the course of ambition the ardor of enterprize the researches of knowledge or the contemplations of philosophy Those noble those exalted privileges of our nature become a painful exercise to faculties which are chained to one idea and to a heart which flutters round one object and can as little change that object as the magnetic needle its direction which  while every star in the glowing firmament sheds its brightness points only and unalterably to  one  CHAP XXVI  MRS Meynell wished much to return Julia's visit but was for several days prevented by the badness of the weather and her finances did not admit of the expence of a hackneycoach For Captain Meynell who was to the last degree mean and parsimonious in his disposition denied her even the little indulgences his narrow income could afford seldom allowed her to have a shilling in her pocket and when he did it was on the same condition upon which the vicar of Wakefield bestowed a guinea upon his daughters viz with a strict injunction not to change it  The first fair day however Mrs  Meynell in spite of dirty streets set out for Mr Clifford's house which was in Berkleysquare She picked her way with difficulty through the dirt apprehensive lest her cloaths should be splashed which she knew would prevent her gaining admittance the servants in wealthy families being in general very nice observers of etiquette and proportioning their civilities with great precision to the dress and appearance of the visitor In crossing over Piccadilly Mrs Meynell was stopped by a carriage and looking up saw Mrs Seymour with her mother and Miss C  in the carriage The ladies bowed to her somewhat superciliously as they passed and Miss C  looked after her till she could see her no longer Mrs Meynell conjectured that they were going to Mr Clifford's and mortified at the thoughts of meeting them and fatigued and dispirited by her toilsome  walk she felt a strong inclination to return home immediately but recollecting that she might very probably have the same disagreeable circumstances to encounter another time she determined to proceed  Mrs Seymour and her party were as Mrs Meynell apprehended going to Mr Clifford's where they were admitted After the usual compliments Mrs Seymour enquired of Julia if Mrs Meynell had returned her visit Julia answered that she had not "Oh then she will be here presently" rejoined Mrs Seymour "for we have just passed her in Piccadilly" "I'm sure" said Miss C  "Mrs Meynell takes a great deal of trouble to wait on you Miss Clifford for we met her wading through the dirt poor woman" "I shall place a particular value on her visit" replied Julia "if that will be any compensation for her  disagreeable walk" "She is certainly very much to be pitied" said Mrs Seymour in a pathetic tone "I'm sure my feelings have been deeply wounded by her situation I must own I'm very sorry she's coming here this morning and I almost wish you would be denied to her my spirits are already so low about my poor little dog I'm afraid I shall lose him after all my nursing he seemed quite well yesterday but this morning he has had a relapse" Julia without once lamenting that Bijoux was subject to relapses coolly said that "she could not think of refusing admittance to Mrs Meynell as she was very desirous to have the pleasure of seeing her" "I believe she's a deserving young woman" said Mrs Melbourne and I should ask her oftener than I do to dine with me for I suppose saving a dinner at home is some object in her circumstances but her melancholy looks are as disagreeable  as the face of a creditor to a man in debt a sort of demand upon one's pity that's very troublesome Her clothes too are grown so shabby that I can only ask her when I'm alone and really my spirits are too weak to bear such a  têteàtête  frequently" "One cannot much wonder" replied Julia "that a woman of Mrs Meynell's sensibility is unhappy in such a situation as her's" "For my part" rejoined Mrs Melbourne "I cannot understand what right people have to the indulgence of so much sensibility who are in poverty People in affluence may indulge the delicacy of their feelings and mine I own are so affected by the company of unfortunate persons that I am obliged in regard to my health to avoid them carefully And I really blame Mrs Meynell quite as much as I pity her She has enough to eat and drink and clothes sufficient to keep her  warm and comfortable but she must be hurt forsooth because her appearance is shabby I suppose she wants to be dressed like Mrs Seymour which is absurd enough" "Then" said Miss C  "one's obliged to be so upon one's guard in her company for the least hint about her situation brings a fit of tears directly I recollect last time I met her at your house you happened to say that you wondered when people were poor they didn't prefer some honest employment to living in poverty I very innocently answered that I supposed they found idleness easy enough upon which she burst into tears and left the room in heroics saying "If such a situation  were  easy Madam I should not be affected as I now am" "Really these airs are intolerable" "I own" said Julia "what strikes  me  as  intolerable  was your hint about idleness for I see nothing but what is natural  in a woman of family and education resenting disrespect" "Family" interrupted Mrs Melbourne "the best thing Miss Clifford that people in poverty can do is to forget their pretensions to family if any such they have and this only requires the effort of a good understanding Poverty and high birth are such an inconvenient alliance that if Mrs Meynell cannot get rid of the first I would advise her by all means to banish the recollection of the latter When she comes into my drawingroom in an old gown with the dignity of a Countess in her own right and expects distinction on account of her family she really strikes me as a very ridiculous figure" "Ridiculous indeed" exclaimed Miss C  with a laugh "it puts me in mind of my green parrot when his feathers have moulted He retains only a little yellow tuft on his head but he opens his wings  with all the exultation possible though they are as bare as a picked fowl" "I must suppose" said Julia colouring with indignation "Mrs Meynell as deficient in understanding as your green parrot Miss C  before I can believe she would expect attention from  you  when she was not in  full  feather I am sure she must long ago have discovered your partiality for fine plumage" Miss C  was a little abashed by this speech and before she had recovered herself sufficiently for the "reproof valiant" Mrs Meynell was announced whom Julia received with distinguished politeness while Miss C  bit her lips and was ready to exclaim "Why should the poor be flattered" Miss C  who had but a very small stock of urbanity and goodnature always laid out her little fund upon usury and demanded exorbitant gratifications of vanity or pleasure in return She therefore considered Julia's  civilities to Mrs Meynell as an extravagant profusion of an article which if properly applied might be turned to some account  When Mrs Seymour and her party rose to take leave after wishing Julia good morning she turned to Mrs Meynell and said "Shall I set you downbut I must explain that it's not in my power to take you to your own door your lodging is so out of the world and I have a great circuit to make to my mother's and Miss C  's and very little time this morning" "It's quite unnecessary to make any apology to me" replied Mrs Meynell coldly "Well but do give me leave to take you  part  of the way" rejoined Mrs Seymour "I'll set you down at the top of the Haymarket wherever the street looks tolerably clean and then at least you'll be within a shilling fare of home"  "I shall certainly put you to no inconvenience on my account" said Mrs Meynell "besides I mean to stay a little longer with Miss Clifford" Upon this Mrs Seymour made her a slight curtesy and departed  When these ladies were gone Mrs Meynell and Julia enjoyed a conversation which rendered them more and more pleased with each other and after consenting to dine at Mr Clifford's the following day and Julia having appointed an hour at which she would call for her in the carriage Mrs Meynell departed soothed and gratified by her visit Julia's attentive kindness seemed to her desolate heart like a solitary flower that dispenses its reviving sweetness amidst surrounding thorns But the pleasure she derived from her visit was embittered by some farther circumstances of mortification for when she reached Mr Clifford's streetdoor the  servant who opened it informed her that it rained a little and asked if she chose to have a coach Mrs Meynell who was conscious that she had but a single shilling in her pocket which was insufficient to pay her coachhire home and which if spent would expose her to much brutality from her husband told the servant that the rain was so trifling it was of no consequence and went away walking very fast till she got out of sight of the house When she reached Piccadilly she met Capt Meynell and the shower increasing they were obliged to take shelter under the porch of a door In a few minutes Mrs Seymour who had set down her mother in Hanoversquare and had since been at some shops in Bondstreet passed in her carriage with Miss C  The rain was now so violent that Mrs Seymour felt it was impossible not to offer to take Mrs Meynell home She therefore  stopped the carriage and begged they would come in Mrs Meynell much mortified at being obliged to accept this offer entered the carriage with regret and her husband followed  "My dear Mrs Meynell" said Mrs Seymour as the carriage drove on "I wonder you venture out such days as these what would you have done if we had not happened to pass" "Why" replied Mrs Meynell waited quietly till the shower was over" "But" rejoined Mrs Seymour in a tone of affected sympathy "I'm really surprised you don't catch your death of cold walking in such weather as this" "Why you know Mrs Seymour" said Miss C  "there's a great deal in habit I suppose it would kill either you or me but Mrs Meynell is used to it" "Ah" thought Mrs Meynell "Is it the fault of poverty Miss C  if its path is rugged and beset with  thorns that you find satisfaction in pointing their edge and making the feet of the weary traveller bleed on his pilgrimage Is it a crime in penury if its bosom is defenceless that you love to poison the arrows which pierce it" Capt Meynell who had sense enough to comprehend the insolence of Miss C  's observation on the force of habit answered in his usual blunt tone "Why faith Ma'am Mrs Meynell till lately was as little  used  to walk in wet weather as yourself and if we go to her ancestors I believe we shall find they have been used to a coach longer than any of the forefathers of this present companyfor instance Miss C  I read in the newspapers that your family was made noble about five years ago and Mrs Meynell's has been noble about five hundred" Miss C  frowned and coloured and afraid of another reproof of equal plainness  observed a sullen silence the rest of the way  Mrs Meynell returned home scarcely finding in the recollection of Julia's sweetness a compensation for the mortifications which had attended her visit Capt Meynell was in illhumour at seeing his wife treated with disrespect But though he saw the tears of vexation fill her eyes he comforted himself with the reflection that her regret would pass away and that in the mean time he had saved coachhire to the amount of eighteenpence He had no conception of the keenness of his wife's sensations and was entirely ignorant that though when a blow is levelled at the  body  the degree of its force is known it is impossible to guess what pain may be inflicted by a blow which is aimed at the  mind  But Capt Meynell was of opinion that a little indignity might be submitted to when it saved money  and was determined never to be guilty of such a waste of pity as to prevent a few tears which cost nothing at the price of eighteenpence  CHAP XXVII  JULIA offended at the expressions which Frederick Seymour had used at their late interview carefully shunned all particular conversation with him though this was accomplished with great difficulty for scarcely a day passed without their meeting Mr Clifford was never happy but in his daughter's society Their parties were generally the same their visits were often made together and Frederick Seymour usually placed himself next Julia except when by some contrivance she put it out of his power Charlotte who had not the smallest suspicion of the real state of her husband's mind was  pleased to see him renew his former attention to her friend till some circumstances which we must now relate brought the fatal secret of his passion to the knowledge of the unhappy Charlotte  Mr Seymour's plan for the accomplishment of his base designs on Mrs Meynell was such as suited a mind hardened in the practice of vice He meant to reduce her to extreme distress and persuaded Captain Meynell over whom he had acquired great influence by promises of a place or pension to remain in London These promises Mr Seymour never meant to fulfil till Mrs Meynell reduced to absolute want and sinking in despair might be driven to accept his assistance upon the only terms on which he was determined to bestow it  It has before been mentioned that Mr Seymour entertained but a contemptible  opinion of the strength of female virtue he had therefore formed his machinations as he imagined with the most artful skill and entertained no doubt of his final success Meanwhile he persecuted this unhappy lady with his visits expressed the most tender sympathy in her situation and endeavoured to sooth her with offers of service But he was not a little alarmed when he heard that Mrs Evans was housekeeper at Mr Clifford's being convinced from what he knew of her character that she would betray his designs to Julia He also fancied he perceived a change in her manner towards him but what gave him far greater vexation was the progress of that young lady's friendship for Mrs Meynell for he saw that at the very moment when he was ready to seize upon his prey Julia's friendship would rescue her from his grasp He was now frequently  deprived of seeing Mrs Meynell who spent much of her time at Mr Clifford's and when she was at home he was often debarred any particular conversation with her by finding Julia of the party Two months were passed by him in this uneasy state of mind when he accidentally heard that Mr Clifford was making interest to obtain a very profitable appointment for Capt Meynell in the East Indies Mr Seymour well knew that Mr Clifford's influence would render the success of his application certain Enraged beyond all bounds at this discovery which at once frustrated all his deeplaid schemes and would place the object of his pursuit entirely out of his power he returned to his own house with his whole soul boiling with indignation against Julia whom he justly considered as the chief mover in this application of Mr Clifford's  Mr Seymour was hastening to conceal his emotion in his library when meeting Mrs Seymour on the stairs she asked him to come into her dressingroom saying she had something to tell him When they reached the dressingroom "O Mr Seymour" said she "I have such a strange piece of intelligence for you and I want to know your opinion of it I have this moment heard from a person whose penetration may be well trusted that your brother Frederick is desperately in love with Julia Clifford and she with him and that they were so before his marriage" Mr Seymour whose prudence would have led him in a calmer moment to contradict a report which might produce the most mischievous consequences being now entirely thrown off his guard by passion disappointment and indignation hastily answered that "if Mrs Seymour had had much  penetration she might have found out that circumstance herself" "Is it really true" said Mrs Seymour "I can't talk of it at present" he replied impatiently "for I have an appointment and must be gone" He then went hastily out of the house for he found himself unable to support either Mrs Seymour's company or the solitude of his library His impetuous passions had met with the rudest shock the machinations of years were in a moment defeated Stung almost to madness by the failure of his designs he found no relief in those projects of ambition which usually occupied his aspiring mind Every object on earth appeared indifferent to him but that which was lost and he gave way to uncontrouled rage frenzy and despair If the guilty even in success are unhappy how complete is their misery in disappointment It is the natural tendency  of vice to depress the mind which when loaded with the additional weight of sorrow sinks into a deep abyss of despondency while the buoyant spirit of virtue resists the pressure of calamity and floats upon the stormy ocean of life unsubdued by the tempest  When the violent agitation of Mr Seymour's mind had a little subsided he reflected on the imprudence into which resentment had led him in assenting to a report which might involve his brother in so much misery He therefore hastened home in order to enquire from whom his wife had received her intelligence and to charge her never to repeat it to any person whatever But he reached home too late Mrs Seymour was gone out and as he had long perceived her envy of Julia's beauty and was well acquainted with her disposition he suspected she would be sufficiently ready to repeat any thing to her disadvantage As soon  as Mrs Seymour returned he desired to know from whom she had received the information she had given him respecting Frederick and Julia Mrs Seymour after some hesitation being again urged by her husband to declare the author of this intelligence at length mentioned Miss Tomkins Mr Seymour flew into a violent passion swore that the circumstance gave him a diabolical idea of Miss Tomkins and that he was convinced she had mentioned her suspicions from some secret malignity towards Julia who he added was too beautiful to escape the persecution of the women He then enquired if Mrs Seymour had repeated to any person what she had heard She acknowledged that she had called upon Mrs Chartres that they had talked of Frederick Seymour and that her son who was at home had mentioned so many strange circumstances in Seymour's behaviour both before and since his marriage that  she was convinced he had discovered the secret she had therefore ventured to remark that it was a little unfortunate for poor Frederick that his wife's cousin was handsomer than herself "But" added Mrs Seymour "I really repented exceedingly what I had said when I found that though Chartres repeated a thousand circumstances which would have brought conviction to any person of less simplicity than himself he had remarked the effects without ever conjecturing the cause I am really vastly sorry for what is past but I am certain that neither Chartres or his mother will ever mention this affair" Mr Seymour however was much disturbed at this recital and appeared far less certain than his wife of Mrs Chartres's capacity for keeping a secret  But it is necessary to explain the motives which influenced Miss Tomkins in communicating the abovementioned intelligence to Mrs Seymour Miss  Tomkins had in the course of the winter frequently been of the same parties with Julia at Lord  's at Mr Seymour's Mr Clifford's and other places Mr F  was always of these parties and his attention was uniformly devoted to Julia In vain Miss Tomkins hoped that Julia's indifference would at length conquer his passion since farther acquaintance with that young lady did but add to his admiration of her beauty the most confirmed esteem for her character Mr F  had penetration enough to perceive that Miss Tomkins resented his preference of Julia but he was not of a temper to be compelled to pay any attention to which he was not prompted by inclination He possessed not that finished politeness which levels all the distinctions of the heart and casts an impenetrable veil over its feelings Mr F  on the contrary acted from the  impulses of his own mind and possessed that independent frankness of spirit which openly avows its preferences and is at no pains to conceal dislike  Miss Tomkins who had flattered herself during the space of some months with delusive expectations of detaching Mr F  from Julia returned home one evening from a party where she had suffered so much mortification from that gentleman's neglect of herself and attention to her rival that stung by envy resentment and despair she determined to go the next morning and relate what she had observed of Frederick Seymour and Julia's mutual attachment to Mrs Seymour through whom she hoped the report would spread wide enough at least to reach Mr F  's ear and Miss Tomkins believed that if the high opinion which he entertained of Julia's character was lessened his admiration of her beauty would prove  a transient sentiment and might soon change its object Miss Tomkins accordingly went to Mrs Seymour the next morning related her suspicions and had just left the house when Mr Seymour returned home  His apprehensions with respect to Mrs Chartres were too well founded The moment Mrs Seymour departed big with the secret full of anger against Julia and pity for Charlotte who was her favourite on account of a present of potted hare and a long Indian shawl Mrs Chartres hastened to Frederick Seymour's house found Charlotte alone and without much circumlocution began by lamenting the caprice and inconstancy of men and after some general abuse of the sex finished her harangue by informing Charlotte of the report she had heardCharlotte was too much struck by the intelligence to have the power of making any reply  She only after a pause of some moments told Mrs Chartres in a faint voice that she felt herself not very well that she wished to go to her own room and begged she would excuse herMrs Chartres after some very commonplace expressions of condolence took her leave quite unconscious of the degree of misery she had occasioned  Charlotte immediately retired to her room in a situation of which no words can convey an adequate idea Every faculty of her soul seemed suspended she felt a sensation as if a heavy weight had been laid upon her heart she could not shed a tear her memory retained every image confusedly her brain was a chaos of perplexity and disorder and she found that to think was distraction When she had recovered the first numbing stroke of surprize and horror which seemed almost to annihilate her mind the recollection of her past happiness called  forth her tears and she wept for a considerable time with great violence Her reflections now threw a gleam of fatal light on the past A thousand circumstances which had hitherto appeared whimsical or capricious in Seymour were now too plainly accounted for and the horrible suspicion became every moment more confirmed to her distracted mind  Alas in the sad catalogue of human evils what calamity is so difficult to bear as the discovery of indifference in that object to whom we have given our affections and intrusted our happinesswhen we find that heart alienated whose tenderness seems necessary to our existence when we read coldness in that eye on whose look our peace dependsHow severe are those pangs for which we must not ask for sympathy that anguish which must be nourished in secret and endured without complaintwhile memory recalls the  images of the past traces with cruel exactness the scenes which some passionate mark of fondness some proof of former attachment have endeared for everrepeats those expressions of tenderness which are recorded in the heart reminds us even of the tone in which they were uttered and gives additional bitterness to our painsIn vain we summon fortitude to our aid The efforts of reason are insufficient to stifle the agonies of passion and silence the voice of despairTime may at length bid these violent emotions subside misery will become habitual and the mind may in some degree accommodate itself to its situation but it must pass through many a severe extreme it must sustain many a terrible conflict before it is thus made familiar with sorrow or finds a refuge from it in the grave  Sometimes in the bitterness of her grief Charlotte felt an impulse to fly to  Julia and repose her anguish on the bosom of her friend But she suddenly recollected with increased affliction that this consolation was denied to her sorrows Friendship and love seemed lost together and her whole system of happiness was wrecked at onceThus the affrighted shepherd on the plains of Sicily when the desolating fires of the volcano have destroyed his beloved cottage and consumed his little treasure longs to fly to the shelter of some holy temple where his tutelar saints may protect him from farther calamity but perceiving with horror the sacred fabric totter the sainted shrines tremble every ray of hope at once forsakes his distracted spirit  CHAP XXVIII  THE unhappy Charlotte wiped away her tears before the return of her husband for her good sense taught her that repining or complaint would only serve to tear asunder the last weak cords of affection and altogether detach a heart which she was now sensible she held only by the ties of pity Love is a plant of delicate texture and when it droops will never be revived by the tears of reproach which like petrifying drops harden instead of cherishing the spot where they fall  Charlotte did not see Julia till two days after this fatal discovery when they met at a concert at Mrs Seymour's  Though but little disposed for music or company Charlotte felt that it would be an easier task to go out than to evade the anxious enquiries her father would make into the cause of her remaining at home And what perhaps weighed more with her than this consideration was a conscious dread which hung upon her mind of betraying her feelings to Julia whom she therefore wished first to meet in the bustle of a croud  Mr Clifford chose to go early and he and Julia came before any other company They found Mrs Seymour with Bijoux in her lap when she rung the bell for her maid to come and take charge of him before any more company arrived The maid advanced submissively towards him patted his head very gently and told her mistress how happy she was to see him in such good spirits and she was sure his  chicken had done him good After more comments of the same kind repeated in the tone and manner in which she would have addressed a young son and heir and accompanied with many respectful endearments Bijoux who was more remarkable for beauty than good temper snarling at being disturbed was tenderly caressed by his mistress and at length dismissed  Charlotte came alone Her father and Julia hastened to speak to her and Mr Clifford took notice that she looked pale But Charlotte declared she was perfectly well and forced herself to chat in her usual gay and easy manner till her heart sunk at the exertion and she contrived to place herself between two ladies who were strangers to her and with whom no conversation was necessary However she soon repented of this measure for in the beginning of the first act of the concert Frederick  Seymour entered the room spoke for a few moments to his wife as he passed then hastened to the other end of the room on pretence of paying his compliments to Mrs Seymour and after a very short conversation with that lady placed himself on a seat behind Julia and talked to her earnestly She answered but seldom and seemed to wish to listen to the music but Charlotte saw that Seymour constantly renewed the conversation The heart of Charlotte was stung by sensations which she had never felt before jealousy had now taken possession of her bosom its sharpedged "iron had entered into her soul" The ladies who were seated next her had endeavoured to engage her in discourse and her natural disposition to oblige so far conquered her reluctance to speak that she answered them with her usual sweetness But upon Seymour's placing himself by  Julia Charlotte's eyes wandered after him her voice changed and though her companions still continued to talk she no longer knew what they said or what she herself replied Her mind was in a state of uncontroulable agitation and though music has power to sooth a gentle or even a deep and settled melancholy the torments of jealousy the agonies of suspence raise a tempest in the soul which no harmony can lull to repose  She thought  that  act of the concert would never finish and the moment it was over moved her seat on pretence of speaking to Julia about an engagement the following day She had scarcely seated herself by Julia when Frederick Seymour rose and went to speak to some gentlemen at another part of the room Charlotte was so much hurt at his changing his place the moment she approached which in a calmer state of  mind she would not even have observed that she could scarcely restrain her tears But her agitation was concealed by the approach of Miss C  who came with great eagerness to declare how much the company had been mistaken in their admiration of a song which had been just sung by a young lady and which it was the general opinion had been executed with the most pathetic sweetness and simplicity Other performances of the evening had been applauded with the usual exclamations of "Very fine Charming Wonderful execution c" but when this song was finished the cant terms of admiration were forgotten while every eye glistened with pleasure and every heart seemed affected Miss C  alone was quite astonished that the song was so liked "For her part" she said "she thought it extremely insipid and she knew that Mrs Seymour who was so  good a judge of music admired that lady's style of singing quite as little as herself" "Ah" thought Julia "when will Miss C  or Mrs Seymour admire excellence" Julia's reflection was founded on a just knowledge of the character of these ladies The lustre of excellence is as painful to envy as the rays of the sun to the bird of night who loves to pour his shrill cry when the birds of sweetest note are absent and to flap his sable wings when they cannot be contrasted with the majestic plumage of the swan or the beautiful feathers of the peacock  The youngest Miss C  did not encroach on her sister's department of criticising the song but undertook herself to criticise the singer whom Charles Seymour having pronounced to be beautiful she instantly exclaimed "Well I wonder you can think her handsome her skin's so coarse and her colour so  much too high besides she has such a remarkable long chin and such very short eyelashesyet she's tolerably  showy  upon the whole but I'm surprized any body should call her beautiful"  Before the second act of the concert began Charlotte who was standing near the harpsichord with a little circle of acquaintances with whom she had no inclination to converse turned over some leaves of a musicbook which lay upon the instrument and found the song the simple melody of which had been applauded She read the words which were as follows  SONG  BROAD in the west the sun descends  I love his parting ray  The robe of purple light he lends  To dress the fading day  For then in yon grey mist array'd  Soon twilight hastens near  And softly throws the deep'ning shade  That hides my frequent tear  From  me  capricious Beauty take  The fruitless boon you gave  Those useless graces that can make  Each youth but  One  my slave  All praise but  his  I careless hear  His  words alone impart  The charm that ever sooths my ear  And melts my partial heart  False youth tho' fair Louisa's face  Tho' bright her tresses shine  Canst thou in her light glances trace  The tenderness of mine  Thy form which from my heart I tear  No more that heart shall move  Alasthe indignation there  Is but the pang of love  Charlotte who could not in her present state of mind read the sentiment expressed in this song without emotion in much agitation shut the book and went to a seat at some distance Julia had gone a short time before to the cardroom with some ladies Charlotte when she reached the seat looked round for her husband but he was not in the concertroom and she concluded he had followed Julia The performers were now preparing to begin the second act and Charlotte who knew that the sound of the music would immediately draw Julia to the concertroom longed as impatiently for the beginning of the second act as she had wished for the conclusion of the first thought she had never known people so tedious in tuning instruments and began to fear those obstinate violins would never be in unison Alas Charlotte it was thy heart that was out of tune and no longer  beat in unison to pleasure or tranquillity In a few minutes the music began and the company returned to the concertroom Charlotte looked wistfully towards the door and at length Julia appeared and Seymour soon followed Charlotte beckoned to Julia to come and sit next her "for then" thought she "if he follows her I shall at least hear what passes and that will be some small comfort" Small indeed was the comfort reserved for Charlotte who was now but too clearsighted to the actions of her husband He did not venture again to place himself next Julia but contrived to engage in conversation with those who were near her and though in the intervals of the music he occasionally left that part of the room for a few minutes he was always sure to come back and place himself where she was perfectly in his view As a bird that is frighted from her nest still flutters round  the spot and continually returns by a circling flight to the dear scene of her treasure  In this act of the concert Mrs Seymour and Miss C  sung a duet so tricked out with ornament and performed with such affected distortions of the lips and apparent labour that the only person who seemed touched with enthusiastic admiration was Mrs Melbourne who sat with her eyes rivetted on her daughter her mouth a little open as if to draw in the angelic sounds and when the song was finished was far louder in her applause than any one else though the company in general considered it as their duty to have recourse to the established routine of "Delightful Astonishing and Divine"  When the concert was over Mr Clifford begged Seymour and Charlotte to go home with him to supper Charlotte  consented notwithstanding she longed to give vent to her tears "For" thought she "though I am so wretched myself it must always be some pleasure to make my father happy yes yes my father at least shall be happy I will go to supper"with what appetite I may"  CHAP XXIX  CHARLOTTE did not long succeed in concealing her affliction from Julia who soon observed that her gaiety was assumed and that some secret cause of sorrow hung upon her spirits The source of her misery she could not discover for though she had often wondered that Charlotte had never discerned any traces of Seymour's unfortunate attachment yet since it had remained so long concealed and since no particular circumstance had lately arisen to awaken suspicion Julia concluded that his wife was still as ignorant of it as ever In spite of all her efforts Charlotte sometimes appeared absent  and thoughtful but when accused of gravity by Julia she would start as from a dream and endeavour to smile at being suspected of low spirits yet Julia's penetration discerned that the smile was artificial and the seriousness real She went in vain the round of conjecture on this subject Sometimes a suspicion came across her mind that Seymour's attachment to herself was betrayed but she felt such horror at the idea that she instantly endeavoured to banish it from her imagination  The time drew near when Mr Chartres was to embark for the East Indies He was convinced that his going to India was a thing fit and right and an expedition he owed his country on account of his projected improvements in philosophy at his return but notwithstanding he had the welfare of philosophy much at heart when the hour of his departure approached he felt that the  thoughts of separation from those he loved excited a sensation of uneasiness which the prospect of future advantage to science had no power to remove and that there was a chilling principle in sorrow which damped the ardor of philosophical research to a degree he had till now thought impossible Chartres who possessed an affectionate and grateful heart felt himself bound by the strongest ties of obligation to Mr Clifford and would have sacrificed his life to render him the smallest service He had the most sincere esteem for Charlotte but Julia's softness had won his soul She was his friend his confidant his counsellor and he would certainly have been in love with her if he had not foreseen how inconvenient he should find such a turbulent sensation at the distance of Bengal He determined therefore to confine his tenderness within the peaceful limits of friendship  for he had heard and gave some credit to the information that when the heart ventured to stray beyond that tranquil boundary the path if sometimes covered with roses was oftener tangled with briars and the sky if occasionally gilded by the rainbow was more frequently obscured by the tempest  Chartres came the day before his departure to bid Julia farewel The tear stood in his eye his heart seemed deeply depressed and he repeatedly declared that he looked forward to no other happiness at his return than that of enjoying her society for in these moments his philosophical improvements were forgotten He told her he had just taken leave of Charlotte whom he found alone and in great dejection her eyes were red and she appeared to have been crying over some papers which were lying on the table "I saw marked upon the back of one of them"  added Chartres "Sonnet to Peace written by Julia" "When at parting" resumed he "Iwished her every happiness she burst into a violent fit of tears shook her head and desired me not to talk of happiness I suppose she thought I was acquainted with that false report which my mother was so imprudent as to repeat to her I see it has made her unhappy and she has never been in good spirits since" "What report" said Julia in a faint voice Chartres then repeated the intelligence which Mrs Seymour had given his mother Julia leaned back on her chair and in a few moments burst into an agony of tears "I wish I had not mentioned this affair" said Chartres "if it makes you uneasy but you have philosophy enough to despise it I convinced Mrs Seymour of its falsehood not merely by vague assertion but by facts which had come under my own observation I told her that far from  having any liking to you I had remarked that he was never less agreeable than in your company and was at so little pains to entertain you that I had frequently known him while speaking to you forget what he was going to say that whenever any body mentioned you he seemed to find the subject disagreeable and always assented to your praise as coldly as if he thought you did not deserve it"  Chartres was proceeding to relate the farther proofs he had given of Seymour's indifference for his auditor had no power to interrupt him but at this moment Mr Clifford knocked at the door and Julia with a great effort summoned sufficient strength to implore Chartres not to repeat to her uncle a report which would give him so much unhappiness Before Mr Clifford reached the room Chartres promised not only that he never would repeat it himself but that he would  also bind his mother in the most solemn manner never to mention it again  When Mr Clifford appeared Julia took leave of Chartres and with some difficulty reached her own apartment shut the door and flung herself on a chair covering her face with her hands in an agony of mind almost insupportable "At length" thought she "the storm which has so long threatened me bursts upon my headCharlotte Oh Charlotte must I be the wretched cause of your misery Must I embitter all the fair prospects of your life and overwhelm that affectionate heart with intolerable anguish Why do I live to fill with despair that bosom which has supported and cherished meOh my father my ever beloved father would that the same grave which holds thee had covered thy unfortunate childWhy did my uncle receive me beneath  his roof Oh far happier had it been for me to have been cast out a deserted orphan than thus to spread desolation and horror in his family to reward his benevolence by inflicting the sharpest calamity by wounding him in the person of his childYes wretch that I am by planting a dagger in the heart of Charlotte I shall bring her father with sorrow to the grave Perhaps his last breath will curse meno he will pity and forgive mebut will not his pity his forgiveness be more piercing than reproach more terrible than his curse"  Julia's mind was long absorbed by these desponding reflections She gave way to uncontrouled affliction sent Mr Clifford word that she was not well and kept her room the remainder of the day When her thoughts had recovered their first confusion and terror she deliberated on her future conduct but knew not on what to determine  At one moment she thought of flying to Charlotte of unbosoming her distress and then forsaking her uncle's house for ever at another moment she wished to find a refuge with Mrs Meynell But farther reflection convinced her that any of these measures would accelerate the mischiefs she so much dreaded by revealing the fatal secret to her uncle without mitigating in the least degree the wretchedness of Charlotte Julia therefore resolved to bear her sufferings in silence to devote herself to her uncle's happiness and to shun Frederick Seymour more carefully than ever  Mean time Mrs Seymour somewhat ashamed of her conduct to Mrs Meynell on the rainy morning determined to pay her a visit in her way to a party at no great distance and about eight o'clock in the evening drove with Mrs Melbourne to Charlesstreet  Mrs Meynell had already drank tea and having devoted the day to mantuamaking had given orders not to be at home But her servant had gone out unknown to her mistress and the woman of the house came up almost out of breath saying "There were some ladies waiting in a carriage to know if she would see them" "Where is my servant" said Mrs Meynell in great distress "Have you said I was at home" "Yes Ma'am but I told them I did not know whether you would chuse to see company" "Then I  must  see them" said Mrs Meynell who though mortified at their intrusion threw off her embarrassment and received them with that ease and dignity which commanded respect Mrs Seymour said she was come to wait upon her to tea but on this hint Mrs Meynell remained quite passive being sensible that it was needless to ring the  bell since there was no person to answer it The children in the room above were crying in a most terrible manner and the mother in order to quiet the youngest having put it into the cradle began rocking with a degree of violence that shook Mrs Seymour's nerves exceedingly who expressed great surprize at Mrs Meynell's remaining in such a lodging At length the servant returned and at length tea was procured the cradle ceased to be rocked and Mrs Seymour's nerves ceased to be shaken  Mrs Meynell's conversation was that of an elegant and cultivated mind and Mrs Seymour who happened to be in goodhumour and who possessed taste and understanding though she strangely perverted both grew insensibly pleased with Mrs Meynell's discourse in spite of her lodgings As there were no gentlemen present she threw aside the graces of affectation  and without having the smallest intention to be agreeable was really much more so than usual for she was too apt to dispose the flowers of fancy with the formality of a trim parterre when she wished to please and it was only in a careless moment that she suffered them to bloom with the graceful negligence of nature  Charlotte and Julia now felt a mutual consciousness which embittered all their interviews those feelings of tender confidence which formerly made every moment of separation painful being lost for ever Julia saw Charlotte pining with secret grief into which she durst not enquire and for which she knew there was no remedy and Charlotte felt a degree of restraint in Julia's presence and often a pang of jealousy which made her avoid the society of her cousin whenever she could find a pretext for so doing without exciting suspicion in her father But  though she skilfully concealed her feelings from him she did not succeed in eluding the penetration of her husband Frederick Seymour perceived with inquietude and disappointment that Julia was less frequently at his house than formerly and though accidental circumstances seemed to prevent it he was convinced from some observations he had made on his wife's behaviour that Julia's absence was nothing less than accidental The idea that his wife was unhappy and unhappy from the discovery of his attachment to another filled him with the deepest concern and he endeavoured by every mark of attention and kindness to chase from her mind those gloomy suspicions which he feared she harboured But this conduct could no longer confer happiness on Charlotte she no longer mistook attention for tenderness and kindness for love Seymour  was a bad dissembler and often strove in vain to suppress his feelings When Charlotte chose to stay at home he frequently gave up his engagements to remain with her but still it appeared to Charlotte a matter of duty and not of inclination His talents were no longer exerted for her entertainment no longer made the hours pass almost imperceptibly away Charlotte sometimes talked to him on subjects of taste and literature of which he was fond and on which he used to give her his opinions with eagerness and animation but he now answered her enquiries in a cold indifferent manner which shewed that he considered it as a task  Sometimes she endeavoured to forget her wretchedness and tried to divert him by those sprightly sallies with which he used to be amused or indulged the fondness of her heart by  an expression of tenderness but she saw or fancied she saw that her gaiety or her tenderness were alike troublesome and received with a degree of coldness and gravity that petrified her soul On these occasions she concealed her emotion till he left the room and then gave way to the tears which she had with difficulty suppressed Yet Seymour meant to give every proof of attachment and earnestly wished to make her happy But when those attentions which belong to affection are prompted only by a sense of duty there is often some failure in the execution even with the greatect rectitude of intention Such services when weighed in the scale of reason may prove rigorously just but in the balance of love they will be found wanting The head may understand the general theory of kindness but the heart only can practise the detail as the sculptor can  give to marble an expression of human feeling but cannot animate the image with a soul  We have obtained a copy of the Sonnet mentioned by Chartres in the former part of this chapter  SONNET TO PEACE  OH visit soothing Peace the thorny dale  Where sad and slow my early steps are led  Far from the sunny paths which others tread  While youth enlivens and while joys prevail  Then I no more shall vanish'd hopes bewail  No more the fruitless tear shall love to shed  When pensive eve her cherish'd gloom has spread  And day's bright tints like my short pleasures fail  But ah lost Peace on thee I call in vain  When loud the angry winds of winter roll  Can he who "bides the pelting storm" repose  The bitter storms of life have pierc'd my soul  Yet earth one lonely spot of refuge shows  The sheltering grave where Peace returns again  CHAP XXX  IT was about the middle of June and Mrs Melbourne invited a party to dine at her villa near town Charlotte was not well enough for this excursion She expected in a short time to become a mother and with delight had anticipated that period when Seymour would have an additional reason for loving her when the smiles of her infant would endear its mother and convey to the breast of both its parents an emotion which though she had not yet felt her heart told her would be exquisite But these dreams of happiness were no more she now only thought of the consolation she should  find in bathing her unconscious infant with tears shed in secret When Charlotte declined joining the party Frederick Seymour declared he would remain at home but she insisted on his going Julia took an opportunity of intreating Charlotte to allow her to stay with her on the day of the party but the offer was rejected with a degree of coldness which shocked Julia so much that she pressed the matter no farther  The party on their arrival at the villa proposed to take a walk on the banks of the Thames The villa was situated at a small distance from the village where Julia had formerly lived and near Mrs Melbourn's gate she met with a poor woman whose husband a labourer used to work in Captain Clifford's garden Julia stopped and begged the company would walk on while she spoke to her old acquaintance They gave the woman some money and went  towards the river At the sight of Julia the poor woman burst into tears "Oh Madam" said she "I've been in a power of troubles since you left the country I've lost my husband Madam and a good soul he was to be sure as ever broke bread He never hit me a stroke in his life we would have a  word  or  two  now and then to be sure but that was nothing to nobody" She then related the hardships she had undergone since her husband's death which were confirmed by her meagre looks and threadbare garment Julia who knew she was a deserving object gave her some present relief and promised to allow her a weekly donation which she should receive from the person who took care of Mrs Melbourn's country house  Without stopping to hear the thanks and blessings of her pensioner Julia then hastened to join the party which she saw walking at some distance on  the banks of the river but at this moment passing a little copse she perceived Frederick Seymour coming through it to meet her He came up to her in a few minutes "Why did you leave the company Mr Seymour" said Julia in a tone of displeasure"Because I could not bear to remain with them when you were absent and told them I would wait for you you know my abhorrence of the whole group of females I have left behind" Julia made no reply for she was so much vexed and agitated at his having left the party for the declared purpose of waiting for her that she had no power to rally her oppressed s pirits "How" continued Seymour "can any man who has the smallest taste for simplicity and nature have pleasure in the society of such women as Mrs Seymour and the Miss C  'sbut  this  day above all others I find their  company detestable and determined to shake off the restraint at least for a few blessed moments" "I do not perfectly understand" said Julia coldly "why their society should be so much more oppressive on this day than any other" "Need I name the reason" cried he passionately "Oh it is a day to me the most decisive of my life it was on this very day I first saw youYes Julia dearest most perfect of women since  that  hour""Is it generous Mr Seymour" interrupted Julia "thus to persecute me to reduce me to the cruel alternative of forsaking my uncle's house or being subject to discourse which it shocks which it degrades me to hear" Her voice faltered and tears fell down her cheeks"Oh" exclaimed Seymour "what have I done if you could see the contrition of my soul if you could form an idea of my misery" "Speak  to me no more Sir" said Julia "for Heaven's sake let me endeavour to compose my thoughts" "Try then to forgive me or if I am unworthy of pardon think at least of my wretchedness with some compassion" Julia was silent and Seymour who saw her turn very pale feared to increase her agitation and durst not trust himself to speak He bitterly lamented his indiscretion only because he saw it had occasioned such disturbance to the mind of Julia for with respect to himself he was careless what comments might be made on his conduct The heart of this unfortunate young man had reached that fatal paroxysm of passion when the opinions of the world become wholly indifferent when the mind cherishes its unhappy feelings when it lives not to itself but to another when every object but one sinks into insignificance when all amusement becomes  painful all society irksome and the diseased heart can only endure the gloom of solitude in the absence of that object to whom it was devoted while every essential good every important consideration all that should be dear and valuable is sacrificed to a passion the remorseless tyranny of which has blasted in youth every blossom of hope subdued every principle of fortitude and conquered every effort of reason  When Frederick Seymour and Julia joined the company Miss C  exclaimed "You look very grave Miss Clifford I suppose your poor woman has told you a most dismal story" "Why yes" answered Julia "it was a melancholy narrative of feebleness and want" "That's the worst part of attending to these poor creatures" said Miss C  "they always insist upon telling one a story of hardships of a mile long Its no great trouble to take a few shillings out  of one's purse but a true and faithful account of their whole history is a monstrous  bore  to be sure" Seymour gave her a look of indignation and Julia made no reply  The day passed at Mrs Melbourne's villa somewhat heavily which generally happens when people set out on what is called a party of pleasure There seems to be such a perverse spirit in pleasure that whenever we send that capricious nymph a particular invitation she refuses to sit down at the banquet The form of preparation frightens her from the vacant seat and she fancies "the table's full"  As it rained violently the greatest part of the afternoon the company looked at the country from the windows walked from one room to another and seemed at a great loss how to get rid of the hours which remained before the carriages were ordered Mr Seymour who performed  the honours of the house saw that he was expected to be gay and agreeable but he was in no humour for either gaiety or agreeableness He had not yet conquered the disappointment of his hopes and though he pursued his schemes of avarice and ambition as indefatigably as ever Mrs Meynell's image still floated in his imagination and the certainty that on the departure of her husband she would immediately banish him from her sight disturbed his repose Incapable of real tenderness his passion which had only impelled him to the destruction of its object made him now sicken at the prospect of her happiness nor could his mind furnish him with any soothing reflections to repel the force of disappointment He could recall no acts of benevolence or generosity no feelings of philanthropy or friendship none of those kind and gentle offices which to a liberal and  open heart are the dearest occupations of life Mr Seymour was conscious that his talents had never been employed for the benefit of any human creature exclusively of his nearest relations and that his fortune had promoted no man's enjoyments but his own He was conscious of having intirely reversed that passage of scripture which declares "that no man liveth to himself" for he had lived to himself only But it seems to be the just punishment of selfishness that when its crafty wisdom has overreached the unsuspicious part of mankind and its schemes are successful it does but enjoy a triumph which an honest and ingenuous mind would think far too dearly purchased at the price of those exquisite sensations which arise from the benevolent affections And when the views of the selfish are disappointed they cannot fly for refuge to the bosom of  friendship They have been too much occupied by every other interest to cultivate an interest in any human heart and are condemned to brood over solitary sorrow Mr Seymour had indeed an affection for his brothers which had led him to promote their advancement in life to the utmost of his ability but even this sentiment was in his breast strongly tinctured with ambition with the idea of aggrandizing his own family and had something extremely selfish in its composition When an enlarged and comprehensive mind such as Mr Seymour possessed capable of every noble exertion and every liberal sentiment employs its talents only to the narrow purposes of selfishness how inadequate how unworthy is the end to the means used for its attainmentIt seems as absurd and monstrous as that system of philosophy which imagined the sun the moon and all those innumerable  worlds which fill the immensity of nature were formed only to revolve round this little speck in creation  Mr Seymour discontented with himself disgusted with others angry at being obliged to appear pleased when he was in illhumour and to talk when he chose to remain silent felt as if this everlasting evening would never close His impatience was perceived by Mrs Seymour who being in very good humour herself Mr F  having said some agreeable things to her during dinner kindly saved her husband the task of supporting conversation any longer by taking out her pocketbook which was stored with enigmas and charards When the faculties of the company had been sufficiently exercised Mrs Seymour produced a sonnet which she said she found on the carpet of her drawingroom one evening the  week before when she had had a great deal of company "It was so scrawled" added she "that I could not discover the handwriting and I can find no owner for it" The sonnet was as follows  SONNET TO THE MOON  THE glitt'ring colours of the day are fled  Come melancholy orb that dwell'st with night  Come and o'er earth thy wand'ring lustre shed  Thy deepest shadow and thy softest light  To me congenial is the gloomy grove  When with faint rays the sloping uplands shine  That gloom those pensive rays alike I love  Whose sadness seems in sympathy with mine  But most for this pale orb thy light is dear  For this benignant orb I hail thee most  That while I pour the unavailing tear  And mourn that hope to me in youth is lost  Thy light can visionary thoughts impart  And lead the Muse to sooth a suff'ring heart  Charlotte spent the day in solitude which her unhappy reflections rendered miserable She fancied she heard Seymour talking to Julia that soothing language which he so well knew how to use she fancied she saw Julia listening to it with sensibility she recalled a thousand circumstances which convinced her that Julia was not perfectly indifferent to his attention she sighed she wept at the recollection and then thought of the happy moments which she had spent the preceding summer in the society of her lover and her friend when favoured far above the common lot of humanity she had no care but that of dispensing good to others and no wish but that of deserving her own felicity Oh Memory why wilt thou for ever strengthen the dark shadows of present affliction by contrasting them with the bright rays of past happiness  At length Seymour returned accompanied  by his brother Charles who told Charlotte that he had never passed a more tiresome day that they had been persecuted by wind and rain and  bored  with charards and enigmas  In the course of conversation Charlotte enquired about a curious shrub which her father had given to Mrs Melbourne Charles Seymour said "it was very flourishing" "I did not observe it" said Seymour "No" rejoined his brother "while we stopped to look at it you were at a distance with Miss Clifford" Charlotte changed colour Seymour cast an angry look at his brother and told in some confusion the story of the old woman "Miss Clifford seemed very little pleased with your attendance" said Charles Seymour "for I never saw her look so grave Miss C  whispered to me that she was sure she was in love" "I think Miss C  's remarks" answered  Seymour sternly "are seldom worth the trouble of repeating" Charles Seymour perceived that his brother was in bad temper and after repeating that he thought a rainy day in the country a great  bore  took his leave being engaged to supper at Miss C  's  When Frederick Seymour and Charlotte were left together she made some efforts to be chearful and had the good sense to forbear from all complaints Alas when an impassioned mind wounded by indifference attempts recrimination it is like a naked and bleeding Indian attacking a man arrayed in complete armour whose fortified bosom no stroke can penetrate while every blow which indignant anguish rashly aims recoils on the unguarded heart  CHAP XXXI  FREDERICK Seymour Charlotte and Julia seemed by mutual consent to assume the appearance of cheerfulness in Mr Clifford's presence They all trembled at the idea of disturbing his peace and extending the misery which preyed upon their own minds to the bosom of their generous benefactor Mr Clifford was not apt to discern what others wished to conceal he therefore mistook this imitation of happiness for the reality and exulted in having been the instrument of dispensing felicity to the objects of his dearest affection feeling it the most precious use of fortune He passed  his time in the exercise of piety and benevolence and in the society of his friends enjoyed a rubber at whist every evening and had no subject of anxiety except the affairs of the state He felt indeed the most watchful solicitude to preserve the balance of power in Europe and was sometimes in low spirits on account of the national debt  The youngest Miss C  had lately been left the addition of ten thousand pounds to her fortune by the death of a rich old aunt with whom she was a favourite and a few weeks after she came into possession of her legacy was married to Mr Charles Seymour This young man had begun the winter campaign by paying his addresses in very rapid succession to the daughters of a certain lord a rich baronet a nabob and two bankers in the city but was repulsed by the parents of those young women on account of not being  able to make settlements adequate to their fortunes Upon receiving the intelligence of Miss C  's legacy he determined though a little tired of acting the part of a lover to perform that character once more Accordingly he paid his addresses to Miss C  was favourably received and in a short time married This union was formed on the wisest motives considering the characters of both parties notwithstanding he disliked his wife at the time of their marriage and the feelings of the lady towads her husband though they did not amount to dislike calmly rested in indifference But he knew that her fortune would be useful and that her connections were honorable and she with no less penetration discerned that his income joined to her own would support her with elegance She saw that his conversation and his shoebuckles his manners and his toupee were all perfectly  tonish  gems of the first water in the regalia of fashion and thought that upon the whole he was a husband that would do her credit Besides she was now twentyseven years of age and had in the course of the last ten years of her life suffered many disappointments from being very apt to construe the slightest attention from any of the other sex into an oblique declaration of love If a gentleman was gay in her company it was with a wicked design to win her heart if he was grave it was owing to the embarrassment of passion Miss C  fancied herself skilled in all the symptoms of love and often entrusted the secret of her conquests to her confidential friends somewhat prematurely till at length tired of misinterpretation she determined to prevent such disagreeable mistakes in future by marrying Mr Charles Seymour without farther loss of time  With these sentiments of mutual convenience encumbered with no feelings of reciprocal affection confidence or esteem Mr Charles Seymour and Miss C  were united Nor were their expectations deceived They certainly enjoyed no domestic satisfaction but thought  that  might well be dispensed with as in the crowd of successive engagements it would have been impossible to find any time to be happy at home even if they had felt the inclination and when so many amusements courted their acceptance abroad they had the moderation to think that one small article of enjoyment ought not to be regretted This congenial pair lived much apart were very civil when they met crouded a number of visits into each day and partook of all the pleasure which dissipation can confer upon its votaries It certainly was not a species of pleasure which an enlarged mind  would pursue or a feeling heart would relish and occasionally it became so very tiresome that from the languor of their countenances an uninformed spectator might have mistaken gaiety for penance They sought for happiness as laboriously as an alchymist for the philosopher's stone but found that like that undiscovered treasure happiness was a hidden property which mocked all the researches of the dissipated  Julia's perplexities and sorrows did not make her negligent of Mrs Meynell's affairs and though some of the evils under which she laboured were such as admitted of no remedy Julia determined at least to remove the miseries of penury a situation which exposes a delicate mind to those mortifications of which however galling it were abject to complain and unavailing to demand sympathy since though the world is liberal of its alms to poverty  wealth has monopolized its respect  Mr Clifford had at Julia's solicitation procured for Capt Meynell a profitable appointment in India and the moment the affair was settled she flew to Mrs Meynell and informed her of the success of the application Mrs Meynell attempted to speak but her voice faltered and she was unable to proceed As the eye is oppressed by sudden light after darkness so her heart was overpowered by sensations to which it had long been a stranger and she burst into a violent fit of tears but how delicious are such feelings Alas the sources of misery that give rise to tears are many and various but how seldom do they proceed from the overflowing tide of happiness  Julia acquainted Mrs Meynell that it would be necessary for Capt Meynell to go to India in a few months and  invited her in Mr Clifford's name to take up her residence in his family during the absence of her husband Mrs Meynell received the invitation with rapture "To find an asylum" cried she in a voice frequently interrupted by tears "to find an asylum beneath your roof to enjoy your society is to me of all plans the most soothing Oh after having so long contended with the world after being shocked by neglect or obliged to combat with insolence how will your gentleness heal every wound of my heartIs there indeed such happiness reserved for me Can the period be near when my days shall pass in tranquillityAlas I never hoped to be at peace againI expected to bear the load of misery till I could no longer support its weight and death came to my relief""Perhaps" added she "I have been criminal in the indulgence of despondency  but I own to you that I have long felt life a burden I have been tempted to say to myself "In the morning Would to God it were evening and in the evening Would to God it were morning"but I shall be happy again and what will endear that happiness I shall owe it to you"  After an effusion of gratitude which Julia in vain endeavoured to interrupt Mrs Meynell in the fulness of her heart mentioned the treatment she had received from Mrs Seymour "While Mr Seymour" said she "was paying his addresses to Miss Melbourne she courted my acquaintance because her intimacy with me brought them more frequently together Yes Miss Clifford when I stood in no need of her friendship she and Mrs Melbourne were both profuse of kindness and lavish in profession But as soon as the period arrived in which their friendship would  have been useful as soon as they discovered that I was left without support and in a manner thrown upon their mercy for protection they instantly changed the tone of their behaviour To their friends my destitute situation was recounted with an ostentatious parade of pity and when left alone with them I met with those slight indignities those petty insults which are perhaps more difficult to bear than any other species of misery They do not indeed rend the heart so deeply as severe misfortunes but tear and gnaw its surface Perhaps those who can thus heap wrongs on the unhappy deserve nothing but contempt yet even while we despise the hand which inflicts the wound we cannot avoid feeling pain from its smart Had Frederick Seymour been in England" added Mrs Meynell "I should have been spared half the wretchedness I have suffered  He has a mind the most noble and elevared he has a heart the most generous and affectionate""I believe so" said Julia faintly "You answer but coldly" rejoined Mrs Meynell "surely you know him well enough to have discovered his merit But I will hazard a reslection to you which I can scarcely bear to indulge He appears to me not perfectly happy there is some secret cause of depression some lurking sorrow that seems to hang upon his mind and affect his spiritsAh Miss Clifford you change colour what do you know of this is he not happy with your cousin" "Indeed you mistake" said Julia "youI believeI mean I am sure Charlotte makes the best of wives "I have no doubt of it" replied Mrs Meynell much astonished at Julia's embarrassment "Her sweetness of disposition" said Julia endeavouring to speak with composure  but her voice faltered and Mrs Meynell after waiting some time for the conclusion of the sentence finding she was unable to proceed answered without seeming to observe her confusion "Yes indeed her disposition seems formed to constitute domestic happiness and perhaps my anxiety for him has led me into an error"  At this moment Frederick Seymour entered the room "I am come" said he with eagerness "from Mr Clifford to give you joy of Captain Meynell's appointment" "You are very good" answered Mrs Meynell "Miss Clifford has just brought me those happy tidings" "It was an office" rejoined Seymour with warmth "which suits her perfectly" "Yes" replied Mrs Meynell "and I owe not only the communication but the event itself to her goodness" "My dear Mrs Meynell" said Julia rising "how very  small must be the merit of any services which are attended with the pleasure I feel at this moment" She then departed leaving Mrs Meynell a subject of conjecture and alarm in the confusion she had betrayed in their conversation respecting Seymour which greatly disturbed her mind even amidst the agreeable prospects which were just opened to herself Julia however soon recovered the agitation she felt from Seymour's sudden appearance and left Mrs Meynell's exulting in the felicity she had been enabled to confer Benevolence was the ruling passion of Julia's soul To sacrifice her own gratifications to those of others to alleviate distress and to diffuse happiness were the most delightful occupations of her mind and she had felt the same ardor of beneficence in her former confined circumstances though it could not produce the same effects as in her present  state of affluence Charity resembles the Spring whose benign influence in a scanty soil can only wake a few scattered blossoms but in a more favourable situation spreads a profusion of beauty and rejoices the heart of nature  CHAP XXXII  THAT unhappy passion which Frederick Seymour cherished gained every day a more fatal ascendancy over his mind To him every hour seemed lost that was not spent in Julia's society for life in his estimation had no other value The only ideas of pleasure and pain in his mind were her presence or her absence for when he saw and conversed with her he desired nothing more on earth and when she was absent he no longer felt any distinction or choice of amusement or society All other objects were to him alike indifferent and the most agreeable company had as little power to  give him entertainment as the most insipid  Mean time Charlotte had too high an opinion of Julia's graces and accomplishments and thought too meanly of her own to believe she could ever regain the heart of Seymour Every gleam of hope forsook her bosom but she had sufficient command over her feelings to appear tranquil She shuddered at  thoughts of betraying by her looks that acute anguish which had sunk into her soul nor did her countenance discover those marks of agitation which a lighter affliction would naturally have impressed upon it When a storm first arises it throws de p lines of darkness amidst the struggling sunbeams but when the gathered tempest has blotted out every ray there is no longer any appearance of shadow  Charlotte had sufficient fortitude to bear her misery without complaint but  she could not conquer her feelings though she endeavoured to suppress them She sometimes received Julia with great coldness and sometimes from an impulse of jealousy was at pains to prevent her from being placed near Seymour This he perceived with resentment and Julia though she thankfully seconded Charlotte's intentions discerned them with anguish  One evening when Charlotte had company Julia whose spirits were deeply depressed appeared uncommonly grave Seymour thought she looked ill and wanted to place himself next her but she was surrounded by ladies and he could not accomplish his design upon which he became impatient and tired and when tea was over went up to a young lady who was sitting next Julia and after much solicitation prevailed on her to play a lesson on the piano forte Charlotte well knew that Seymour had  no fondness for any but simple music and that when young ladies were called upon to exhibit their power of performing what was difficult he was ever ready to exclaim with Doctor Johnson "Would it had been impossible" Charlotte therefore could give little credit to this sudden change of taste for her heart told her that he only wanted a pretence to place himself next Julia and her jealousy prompted her while he was attending the lady to the piano forte to go and fill her vacant seat Alas it is the peculiar curse of jealousy that its watchful spirit is never lulled to repose And the reason why "trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmation strong as proofs of Holy Writ" is that love instructs the heart to discern those minute shades of conduct which pass intirely unnoticed by others It is often wounded by indifference It is often stung by unkindness while they lurk  under the usual forms of behaviour and are altogether hidden from common observation  Seymour in a few moments looked round and saw that the young lady's chair was occupied by Charlotte who asked Julia some indifferent questions in which she clearly perceived that Charlotte's mind was not at all concerned and discovered that the movement she had made was merely the effect of jealousy When the lesson was finished the young lady sat down in another part of the room and Charlotte being obliged to move on the entrance of more company Seymour placed himself by Julia who determined to leave him the moment she could do it without the appearance of rudeness In the mean time a gentleman was explaining to a circle at a little distance a curious piece of mechanism he had just seen in doing which he addressed himself particularly to Charlotte  who seemed attentive to what he said but in reality knew not one syllable of what was passing She was listening attentively to Seymour and heard a few indistinct words which heightened her chagrin as she saw that Seymour's soul was absorbed in the conversation and fancied that Julia heard him with pleasure A gentleman who was placed next to Charlotte afterwards tried to engage her in conversation but though she was obliged to listen she commanded her attention with infinite difficulty her eyes often wandering involuntarily to that part of the room were Seymour and Julia were sitting She tried indeed to smile at such parts of the conversation in which she was engaged as seemed to require it while her heart was overwhelmed with despair Her absence of mind however was not remarked by this gentleman who was a solemn sort of person that studied his phrases came  into company prepared to say what were called by courtesy  good things  which he always accompanied with some action that displayed his large diamond ring and had no conception that human attention could be diverted to any other object while he was speaking  The subject of Seymour's conversation with Julia was the description of a scene he had been contemplating in his ride that morning This he described strongly and Julia who delighted in every view of nature could not hear him on such a subject with displeasure seeing however Charlotte's eyes wandering towards them the moment he ceased speaking she rose and joined her party Charlotte spoke to her very drily and Julia was so much hurt by this coldness that tears started into her eyes and as soon as the carriage was announced she hurried out of the house  ready to exclaim in the words of Shakespeare  Is all the counsel that we two have shar'd  The sisters vows the hours that we have spent  When we have chid the hastyfooted time  For parting usO and is all forgot  More than usually depressed and wretched it was some hours that night after Julia went to bed before she could compose herself to rest and when at length she fell asleep her imagination was disturbed by dreams of horror Sometimes she fancied herself wandering among fearful precipices that overhung a deep abyss of waters which rolled black and turbulent beneath while on the edge of the highest cliff stood Charlotte with her bosom uncovered and her hair dishevelled by the winds Her face had lost all its sweetness her eyes had a look of frenzy and darting a  furious glance on Julia she accused her of having brought her to distraction Julia was going to reply but she sobbed violently and the agitation of her mind awaked her She fell asleep again and fancied she saw Seymour stretched upon the floor his eyes closed and his features distorted by death She called to Charlotte for helpCharlotte appearedher face was pale her eyes were languid and she tottered as she walked When she came near she gazed on the lifeless figure at her feet with her hands clasped In an agony of grief she knelt by the dead body and kissed it a thousand times then turning mournfully to Julia she cried "This is your doing but I forgive you" Julia sprang forward to embrace her and awoke She determined to avoid a repetition of these gloomy visions and arose earlier than usual  Mr Clifford went out as soon as breakfast was over and Julia who was much indisposed gave orders to admit no company but when her uncle returned Frederick Seymour whom he had met in the street was with him "I have bought some drawings for you Julia" said Mr Clifford as he entered "do Seymour shew them to her while I speak to the person who is waiting in the hall I shall be back immediately" He then left the room Julia turned pale at being left alone with Seymour She was overwhelmed with the sensations of the past evening and the impression which the gloomy visions of the night had left on her imagination but she endeavoured to assume though not with much success an appearance of tranquillity and forced herself to talk of the drawings Her remarks however were not very acute and Seymour though a connoisseur in  drawing displayed but a small share of critical judgment on this occasion One of the drawings was Thomson's Lavinia Julia made some observations on the picture but Seymour now preserved a gloomy silence which she dreaded would end in some passionate exclamation and therefore continued speaking though she found it no easy task either to collect her ideas or to articulate her words "Thomson" said she "is of all poets to me the most soothing and when I feel any vexation a few pages of the Seasons serve to calm my mind immediately" "Poetry has no such effect on me" replied Seymour "it only renders me more susceptible of misery Happy is the man who can imitate the wisdom of Chartres who seeks for solace in mathematics instead of belles lettres and employs his understanding while his feelings are at rest"  One of the engravings was the picture of Charlotte at Werter's tomb Julia on seeing it laid it hastily aside and was going to examine another print "Do let me look at the tomb of Werter" said Seymour "I think it is ill executed" replied Julia "You will at least allow that the subject is interesting" he rejoined Julia was silent "Are you of a different opinion" said Seymour "I think there can be but one opinion of that book" replied Julia "every one must acknowledge that it is well written but few will justify its principles" "I am one of those few" replied Seymour "I am sorry for it" answered Julia "but we will talk no more about it for I do not wish to like it better" "But  one  word" said Seymour "and I have done People talk of the bad tendency of this book and blame the author for blending virtue and vice in the same character because  the example is dangerous Does any person when pleased with a book immediately determine to imitate the hero of it in every particular and has not the Author of our being blended virtue and vice in the great book of nature Why does Werter interest us Because he is not a phoenix of romance but has the feelings and infirmities of man He is subject to the power of passionlet those who never felt its influence condemn him those who  have  felt its influence too well know that it is absolute that it is unconquerable The heart that is bleeding with an incurable wound needs not the cold counsels of reason to be informed that such feelings are painful and ought to be subdued It is already but too sensible of these truths but it is also sensible that its misery is irretrieveable that it mocks the vain efforts of prudence and that if peace depends upon indifference it is a good which is unattainable  which can never""I must interrupt you" said Julia in a faltering voice "for I cannot stay any longer" He did not attempt to detain her but rose in great agitation to open the door and she hurried away She met Mr Clifford in the hall "You have stayed a long time Sir" she said with some difficulty "I could not dispatch my business sooner" he replied "but you look very pale Julia are you well" "Very well" said she in a voice scarcely audible and then hastened to her room "How cruel" thought she "is my situation I make every effort to avoid him yet am I continually thrown in his way and have no power to prevent it without discovering to my uncle that fatal secret which would for ever rob him of peace What will become of mehow shall I actwhere shall I flyalas I see no end of my conflicts but in death would  I were prepared to dieOh my dearest my ever lamented father if your spirit still hovers over your child assist and guide her in these perplexitiesOh never never will she again enjoy those days of sweetness and tranquillity which were spent under your protecting careYet Heaven that sees my heart knows it is guiltless"  Julia dined that day at Frederick Seymour's with a large company Mr Clifford being engaged with a party of gentlemen After dinner Julia found herself so ill that when the ladies returned to the drawingroom she told Charlotte that she had a bad headach and begged she would allow her to go home Charlotte no longer felt any wish to detain her for though they were still obliged to pass much of their time in each other's society restraint perplexity and uneasiness had taken place of the tender intercourse of affection  These fair friends were like two roses which had once grown on the same stalk but which some rude hand had torn asunder and though their leaves were still mixed together in  one  nosegay the tie that formerly united their stems was broken for ever  Julia was anxious to depart before the gentlemen returned to the drawingroom and sent immediately for a chair but at the moment a servant came to tell her a chair was ready the gentlemen entered the room Seymour with a degree of perturbation which he could ill conceal came up to her and enquired where she was going "I have the headach" she replied "and am going home" "Let me hand you to your chair" said Seymour following her out of the room A few minutes after a violent noise and confusion were heard in the hall Charlotte rang the bell but it was not answered and the noise  still increasing she went to the door where she heard a number of voices and a great tumult She hastened down stairs accompanied by several gentlemen and found that one of Julia's chairmen had fallen near Frederick Seymour's door the chair was broken and the glasses were shivered When Charlotte reached the hall Seymour and the servants were taking Julia out of the chair her forehead was cut with the broken glass and bled violently Charlotte as she came towards her cast a glance at Seymour and from the despair visible in his countenance concluded that Julia was dying She flew eagerly to her assistance while Seymour in a voice of horror uttered words the most incoherent and seemed deprived of his reason but in the general alarm and confusion the agonies of his mind were unobserved by all but Charlotte who though much affected herself by Julia's  situation could not perceive Seymour's violent agitation without an emotion the most painful A surgeon was sent for who stopped the bleeding and found that the wound was but a slight one Charlotte intreated her cousin to remain all night at her house but Julia assured her she was well enough to return home Charlotte's carriage was immediately ordered and when it was ready Frederick Seymour insisted upon attending Julia home in vain she declared that she was quite recovered and that his going was intirely unnecessary Seymour persisted in his design which Charlotte felt herself obliged to second though that look of distraction and that voice of despair to which the accident gave rise were still present to her mind  Julia in the way home remarked to Seymour "that it was fortunate his servants saw the accident and came so  immediately to her assistance" "The only person who saw the accident" replied Seymour "was myself I was looking after your chair and when I saw it fall flew to the spot and called to the servants to follow" Julia after this information thought it prudent to say no more on the subject Seymour was still in too great perturbation of mind to trust himself to speak and they reached Mr Clifford's house without uttering another word  CHAP XXXIII  IN the midst of many worldly schemes which it would have required a length of years to accomplish Mrs Melbourne was seized with a dangerous disorder Mrs Seymour paid her a visit of half an hour every day but the remainder of the day was spent in solitude which afforded no very comfortable reflections to her mind the opportunities of doing good which she had neglected being the subjects of her frequent meditation How different is the opinion which we cherish of ourselves in the days of health and when we feel the approaches of death At the appearance of that king of terrors the  delusive mist which selflove throws around our vices and our weaknesses "melts into thin air" and the naked heart shrinks from its own observation  Mrs Melbourne now became sensible that she had not deserved the blessings of friendship and she found herself left to die without its consolations Deserted by every body formal messages to enquire how she did were all the marks of sympathy she received for she had no friend to pay her those tender offices those minute attentions which smooth the bed of death and which money cannot purchase of those who are paid for their attendance on the dying Her servants were more occupied by their own affairs than her sufferings and being no longer able to exercise authority she was left entirely to their mercy The person to whom she was most obliged was Julia who when she  found her desolate and unhappy visited her every day and administered all the comfort her feeling heart could give  Mrs Melbourne left her daughter a considerable addition of fortune and Mr Seymour who had long been weary of those civilities which decency obliged him to pay to the mother of his wife and who was eager to seize on her property heartily rejoiced in her death Besides it was one of his opinions that no woman ought to survive the age of fifty and he had often secretly blamed Mrs Melbourne for being guilty of so great an impropriety  Charlotte's apprehensions that the heart of Seymour was wholly devoted to another had received the most cruel confirmation from his behaviour while he thought Julia's life in danger Thrown entirely off his guard by the surprize and horror which the accident occasioned he had displayed in those  moments to the watchful eyes of Charlotte the uncontrouled agonies of afflicted tenderness the distracted solicitude of apprehensive passion His voice his look his frantic movements being all treasured in Charlotte's remembrance her coldness and restraint towards Julia daily increased and gave the finishing stroke to the peace of that unfortunate young lady To know she was the cause of Charlotte's wretchedness to see her heart alienated to read reproach and anguish in her looks which used to beam with affection and delight was a species of misery which the sensibility of Julia was unable to sustain Her frame was naturally delicate and the uneasiness of her mind at length produced so great an alteration in her that she grew pale and thin lost her appetite and her health sensibly declined  Charlotte's heart was too honest and affectionate to observe these symptoms of decay with unconcern Julia never made the least complaint but Charlotte now discerned in her countenance the sadness of her mind She was conscious she had of late treated Julia with harshness and revolving in her mind every circumstance of Julia's conduct she felt that she had not merited this unkindness She fancied she saw her sinking into the grave without complaint and struggling to conceal from every eye the anguish that preyed upon her heart The warm and generous bosom of Charlotte was unable to support these reflections her jealousy was softened her suspicions vanished she thought only of Julia's virtues and she felt that nothing was dearer to her than Julia's friendship  Mr Clifford and Julia coming to dine at Frederick Seymour's Charlotte  received her cousin with the tenderness of former days At dinner Julia sent away her plate when she had scarcely eaten a morsel Charlotte who was watchful of her and observed it tried to persuade her to eat something more which Julia declined When the servants had left the room "Indeed" said Charlotte with eagerness "I can bear this no longerI am sure Julia is very ill though she does not complain Yes my dearest Julia" added she bursting into tears and sobbing "my first my beloved friend yes you are ill and I am miserable" Julia equally astonished and affected at this effusion of tenderness had no power to make any reply She pressed Charlotte's hand in her's while Mr Clifford insisted that a physician might be sent for immediately Julia made all the opposition she could from a consciousness of the inability of medicine "to minister to a  mind diseased" but Mr Clifford's fears were awakened and he was not to be moved from his purpose The physician was sent for but Julia found in the returning tenderness of Charlotte a cordial of more powerful efficacy than any which the art of medicine could administer  Seymour felt Charlotte endeared to him by the solicitude she displayed for Julia He saw his wife's excellencewas charmed with her generous affection and endeavoured by the most tender and unremitting attention to convince her how highly he esteemed her virtues Charlotte's open and ingenuous heart was soothed by this conduct She perceived that Seymour had the strongest desire to make her happy and she felt her former tenderness for Julia awakened by the dread of losing her She could not endure the tormenting idea that her neglect or harshness would  perhaps shorten the life of Julia of the dear companion of her childhood the beloved friend of her youth the constant associate of her joys and sorrows She behaved to her with her former kindness Seymour carefully restrained his feelings Julia grew better and they lived for some weeks in great cordiality and friendship  Mr F  called at Mr Clifford's one evening and finding Charlotte and Julia sitting at work he desired their permission to read to them a poem written by a friend lately arrived from France and who for some supposed offence against the state had been immured several years in the Bastille but was at length liberated by the interference of a person in power The horrors of his solitary dungeon were one night cheered by the following prophetic dream  THE BASTILLE A VISION  I  " DREAR cell along whose lonely bounds  " Unvisited by light  " Chill silence dwells with night  " Save when the clanging fetter sounds  " Abyss where mercy never came  " Nor hope the wretch can find  " Where long inaction wastes the frame  " And half annihilates the mind  I  " Stretch'd helpless in this living tomb  " Oh haste congenial death  " Seize seize this ling'ring breath  " And shroud me in unconscious gloom  " Britain thy exil'd son no more  " Thy blissful vales shall see  " Why did I leave thy hallow'd shore  " Distinguish'd land where all are free"  I  Bastille within thy hideous pile  Which stains of blood defile  Thus rose the captive's sighs  Till slumber seal'd his weeping eyes  Terrific visions hover near  He sees an awful form appear  Who drags his step to deeper cells  Where stranger wilder horror dwells  II  " Oh tear me from these haunted walls  " Or those fierce shapes controul  " Lest madness seize my soul  " That pond'rous mask of iron  Alluding to the prisoner who has excited so many conjectures in Europe  falls  " I see""Rash mortal ha beware  " Nor breathe that hidden name  " Should those dire accents wound the air  " Know death shall lock thy stiff'ning frame"  II  " Hark that loud bell which sullen tolls  " It wakes a shriek of woe  " From yawning depths below  " Shrill through this hollow vault it rolls"  " A deed was done in this black cell  " Unfit for mortal ear  " A deed was done when toll'd that knell  " No human heart could live and hear  II  " Rouze thee from thy numbing trance  " Near yon thick gloom advance  " The solid cloud has shook  " Arm all thy soul with strength to look  " Enough thy starting locks have rose  " Thy limbs have fail'd thy blood has froze  " On scenes so foul with mad affright  " I fix no more thy fasten'd sight"  III  " Those troubled phantoms melt away  " I lose the sense of care  " I feel the vital air  " I see I  see  the light of day  " Visions of bliss eternal powers  " What force has shook those hated walls  " What arm has rent those threat'ning towers  " It fallsthe guilty fabric falls"  III  " Now favour'd mortal now behold  " To soothe thy captive state  " I ope the book of fate  " Mark what its registers unfold  " Where this dark pile in chaos lies  " With nature's execrations hurl'd  " Shall Freedom's sacred temple rise  " And charm an emulating world  III  " 'Tis her awak'ning voice commands  " Those firm those patriot bands  " Arm'd to avenge her cause  " And guard her violated laws  " Did ever earth a scene display  " More glorious to the eye of day  " Than millions with

" 'Tis thine to love all nature's weal  " To give each gen'rous purpose birth  " And renovate the gladden'd earth"  CHAP XXXIV  WHEN Charlotte's hour of danger approached she intreated Julia to come and stay at her house during her confinement Julia was gratified by this mark of confidence but excused herself from staying in the house promising at the same time to spend with Charlotte the greatest part of every day  Charlotte being delivered of a son Seymour beheld his child with transport and Mr Clifford felt the birth of this infant a renewal of his own existence A few days after her lyingin Charlotte was seized with some degree of fever and Julia terrified at her danger no  longer hesitated to remain at the house where she scarcely quitted her bedside for a moment and attended her with unremitting care In a few days the disorder abated and Julia was sitting in Charlotte's room soothed with the hope of her recovery when she received a message that a person below wished to speak to her She went into the parlour where she found Frederick Seymour alone He told her that he had had for some days past a very oppressive pain in his head and that he had that morning felt himself so much disordered that he had made Charlotte's physician feel his pulse "He says" added Seymour "that I have a considerable degree of fever and has ordered me to go to bed immediately I am terrified at the thoughts of alarming Charlotte but I find myself so much indisposed that I must obey the doctor's directions" Julia promised she would endeavour  to conceal his illness from Charlotte at least for that day and then in much anxiety left the room  The physician visited Seymour again that evening and found he was worse The next day Julia who could no longer evade Charlotte's enquiries or find any pretext for his absence was obliged to inform her of his illness which she did in the most cautious manner Charlotte lamented her own confinement and implored Julia to attend him and see that no care was neglected For some days his fever increased He believed himself in danger and intreated Julia not to enter his room telling her that he knew his disorder was infectious and that he trembled lest she should suffer from her attendance on him" Julia replied "that she was not afraid of the consequences and that her duty to Charlotte"  her heart grew full and she paused  The next morning the physician declared that his patient was better Julia flew to give this joyful intelligence to Charlotte who insisted upon being carried into his room notwithstanding Julia's representations of the danger attending it in her present state of weakness but Charlotte would not be dissuaded and was supported into his room by her attendants She threw her arms round his neck and wept violently He was affected by her tenderness and pèrhaps not less so from observing that Julia wept too "We shall be happy yet my dearest husband" said Charlotte "and how shall we ever be grateful enough to Julia for her care of us both" "She has been our guardian angel" replied Seymour with emotion"Indeed" said Julia "I must now use my authority as headnurse  and insist upon Charlotte's returning to her room for I am convinced this scene has already been too long for either of my patients" Charlotte still clung to Seymour in an agony of tenderness and was with difficulty prevailed on to return to her own apartment which she at length did attended by Julia  As the physician had pronounced Seymour so much better Julia did not think it necessary to visit him again until the evening Perhaps if she had followed the dictates of her heart she would have gone sooner but she was too virtuous to do more on this occasion than duty required When she went to his bedside in the evening and enquired how he did she was shocked by a remarkable change in the tone of his voice His articulation was thick and confused and he spoke with a quickness quite different from his usual  manner He told her that he was much better but Julia doubted it from the way in which he told her so She waited anxiously when the physician came till he left his patient's room "How is Mr Seymour" said she eagerly "I am concerned" answered the physician "to tell you that he is worse" "Good God" said Julia starting "I apprehended thishis voice is changed" "It is" said the physician "and the fever has increased most rapidlyYou look very pale Miss Clifford let me lead you to a chair" She burst into tears"Oh how shall I tell Charlotte" she exclaimed "I intreat you will not tell her at present" said the physician "he must be kept perfectly quiet this night will probably determine the issue of his disorder" "This night" said Julia clasping her hands "Do not tell Mrs Seymour of this change in his disorder till tomorrow"  "But if he should die tonight""That is not probable" said the physician Mr Clifford entered the room and the physician after informing him of the unfavourable change in Seymour's disorder advised him earnestly to conceal it from Charlotte at least for some days since in her present state of weakness it might produce the worst consequences to herself  When Julia returned to Seymour's apartment she found him delirious "Oh you are come again" exclaimed he with quickness"I thought you were gone for everI dreamt you had forsaken meleft me to die aloneI had a horrible dreammy head burns while I think of itCharlotte looked fiercely on meCharlotte will never pardonshe was gentle once but  now  "he gave a deep sigh"Do not speak my  dear Mr Seymour" said Julia faintly"Dear"he repeated in a low muttering tone"Oh Julia Juliaif I am dearI charge you mark the spot where I am buriedmark where they lay menever never forget itand let it be your graveit will be no crime JuliaTell me if it will be a crime"Julia left his bedside to wipe away her tears"Where is she where is she" said Seymour in a hurried manner to the nurse"Do you want Miss Clifford Sir" she enquired"Miss Clifford" he repeated"She will be here Sir directly""Oh bless her Merciful Heaven bless herIf I could pray my last prayer shouldBut don't tell Charlottepoor Charlotte no noI dare not pray for Charlotte"  Mr Clifford and Julia sat by his bedside all night He continued talking  at intervals with the wildest incoherence sometimes raving of Julia then fancying he was kneeling to Charlotte for pardon and calling to his infant to plead for him Mr Clifford considered all he said as the inexplicable wanderings of frenzy but Julia who well understood their force listened to them with unutterable agony  The next morning his pulse grew much weaker and a few hours before his death the delirium ceased He called Mr Clifford to his bedside took hold of his hand which he affectionately pressed and thanked him fervently for all his past goodness to himHe then enquired if Charlotte was informed of his dangerMr Clifford told him that the physician had declared it would be risquing her life to acquaint her with his situation "Oh no" cried Seymour "let her be spared a scene of partingbut tell hersince I  shall never see my wife and child againtell her that my affection my esteem for her virtues"His voice faltered and he was unable to proceed Mr Clifford in great emotion left the room and Seymour desired the nurse to let Miss Clifford know he wished to speak to her  When Julia came into the room he begged she would order the attendants to leave it He then said in a faint voice "I have solicited this last interview my dear Miss Clifford that I may obtain your forgiveness and may die in peace Oh Julia forgive me all that is pastpardon the uneasiness my conduct has given youOh tell me while I yet live to hear it that you forgive methe atonement of my errors will soon be madea few hours" His voice became choaked by his rising emotion and her hand which he held in his was bathed with his tears She mixed her tears with hisshe assured him in  broken accents that her heart would ever cherish his memory with esteem and regret He then directed her where to find the key of his scrutore telling her it contained some things which he wished to restore to herself that her feelings might not be wounded by those memorials being exposed to other eyes Julia unlocked his scrutore and found her lost glove together with some verses and notes in her own handwriting which he had preserved on that account He desired to see those treasures once more He took them eagerly from her pressed them to his bosom his lips and declared he would only have parted with them in death Then growing fainter from these exertions and seeing her violently affected he said with much emotion "Let not this scene I conjure you make too deep an impression on your feeling heart Oh if my remembrance  will embitter your peace think of me no moreHave I desired you to think of me no morealas Julia my heart assents not to that request Oh no my heart refuses to be forgotten by youlet me be sometimes recalled to your mind and when the grave shall hide me for ever from your sight think not of me with resentment" "Alas" said Julia in a faltering voice "is not the anguish with which I am overwhelmed at this moment a proof that my resentment is past and that all that remains is the bitterness of sorrow" "I hope" said Seymour after a pause of some minutes "I hope Charlotte will find comfort in your friendship Poor Charlotte I fear she has of late been unhappy  she  who is so deserving of felicityOh it is fit I should die who only lived to embitter the lives of those to whom my soul is most devoted  Comfort my poor Charlotte dearest Miss Clifford and assure her that my affection for her was active even in death" He now became still fainter "Oh" cried he in a low indistinct voice "how often have I wished to die in your presencehow often have I desired that you might be near me when I yielded my last breath that your regret might soften my latest momentsthat you might be the last object my eyes beheldOh speak to me Julia speak and let me hear your voice once more" She tried to speak but she had lost the power of utterance She gave him her handhe pressed it to his lipsshe lifted up her eyes and perceived he had fainted She rose with some difficulty and rang the bell for the attendants he recovered from the fainting but soon after became speechless Mr Clifford and Julia knelt by his bedside and he held  her hand grasped in hisOh is there any sorrow like that which we feel when hanging over the bed of our dying friendwhen we know there is no hope when we are certain that a few minutes must tear them from us for everwhen we bathe their stiffening hands with unavailing tears and see them suffering pains beyond the reach of human aid and when at last we lift our eyes to Heaven not in the blessed hope of their recovery but only to implore that the latest struggles may be alleviated that their pangs may be short  When Seymour's eyes were closed he still continued to grasp Julia's hand and in a short time expired  Such was the fate of this unfortunate young man who fell the victim of that fatal passion which he at first unhappily indulged and which he was at length unable to subdue The conflicts  of his mind by insensibly weakening his frame gave greater power to his disorder and thus probably shortened the life they had embittered  Let those who possess the talents or the virtues by which he was distinguished avoid similar wretchedness by guarding their minds against the influence of passion since if it be once suffered to acquire an undue ascendency over reason we shall in vain attempt to controul its power we might as soon arrest the winds in their violence or stop the torrent in its course It is too late to rear the mounds of defence when the impetuous flood rages in its strength and overthrows all opposition With a frame labouring under disease we may recall with regret the blissful hours of health but have no power to new string the nerves or shake off the malady that loads the springs of life Alas the distempered heart when it  has suffered the disorders of passion to gain strength can find no balsam in nature to heal their malignancy no remedy but death In vain we may lament the loss of our tranquillity for peace like the wandering dove has forsaken its habitation in the bosom and will return no more  Julia so far as she had indulged any sensibility to Seymour's attachment was proportionably wretched Women have even greater reason than men to fortify their hearts against those strong affections which when not regulated by discretion plunge in aggravated misery that sex who to use the words of an elegant and amiable writer  Vide Dr Gregory's Legacy to his Daughters  "cannot plunge into business or dissipate themselves in pleasure and riot as men too often do when under the pressure of misfortunes but must bear their sorrows  in silence unknown and unpitied must often put on a face of serenity and chearfulness when their hearts are torn with anguish or sinking in despair" Though a woman with rectitude of principle will resolutely combat those feelings which her reason condemns yet if they have been suffered to acquire force the struggle often proves too severe for the delicacy of the female frame and though reason virtue and piety may sustain the conflict with the heart life is frequently the atonement of its weakness  Julia when she saw that Seymour was dead fixed her eyes on his corpse she shuddered she groaned deeply but uttered not a word From this dreadful stupor she was roused by a message from Charlotte who suspected from the anxiety visible in the countenances of her attendants that Seymour was worse and Julia's looks confirmed all her apprehensions  She enquired eagerly for her husband Julia spoke but her words were incoherent and only halfpronounced Charlotte every moment more alarmed became so positive in her determination to be again carried into his apartment that Julia was obliged to acknowledge that his fever was increased and when this only made Charlotte more earnest in her desire to see him Mr Clifford was forced to give her the fatal information that Seymour was no more  Charlotte lamented him with all the violence of unrestrained affliction and a thousand times reproached her father and Julia for having concealed his danger and denied her the melancholy consolation of attending him in his last moments The shock she had sustained long retarded her recovery but at length she regained her health and found comfort in her infant whom she  nursed herself and in whom she centered all her hopes and affections After some time she returned to her father's house where she and Julia lived in the most perfect friendship  Mrs Meynell on the departure of her husband for India was received into Mr Clifford's family where she was treated with every mark of respect and kindness Captain Meynell a few years after died in India and the fortune he had acquired was transmitted to his wife who still continued to live in Mr Clifford's family  Mr Seymour disappointed in his designs on Mrs Meynell pursued other objects of pleasure and formed new schemes of ambition but neither ambition nor pleasure could confer felicity on a mind which was harrassed by impetuous passions and unsupported by conscious integrity  Mrs Seymour perceiving in a few  years that the bloom of youth was fled endeavoured to supply the deficiency with an additional quantity of rouge devoting more hours than formerly to the duties of the toilet and pathetically lamenting in secret soliloquies the inhuman ravages of time  Mr Chartres by his own diligence and the assistance of powerful friends was soon enabled to send considerable remittances to his mother who removed to a house where the drawingroom held her cardtables with more convenience and discharged Thomas for a fashionable domestic  Mr F  spent most of his time at Mr Clifford's house remaining unmarried and preferring Julia's friendship to an union with Miss Tomkins who also continued single and suffered the most severe mortification from the failure of her schemes on Mr F  Still however she continued to impose  an artificial character upon the world uniting with the miserable triumphs of deceit the comfortless sensations of selfishness  Mr and Mrs Charles Seymour lived together on the most fashionable terms too careless to regard decorum and too indifferent to feel jealousy  The eldest Miss C  remained single and whenever she heard of a splendid marriage longed to forbid the banns  The dying image of Seymour was long present to Julia's imagination and the parting words he had uttered were engraven on her heart When the allsubduing influence of time had soothed her sorrows into greater tranquillity she found consolation in the duties of religion the exercise of benevolence and the society of persons of understanding and merit To such people her acquaintance was highly valuable  and she lived admired respected and beloved She refused many honourable offers of marriage and devoted much of her time to the improvement of Seymour's child whom she loved with the most partial fondness But the idea of its father still continued at times to embitter the satisfaction of her life which but for that one unconquered weakness would have been above the common lot fortunate and happy  END OF THE SECOND VOLUME
