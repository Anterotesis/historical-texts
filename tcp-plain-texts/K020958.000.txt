made in jest  Not yet by modern MANDEVILLES disgrac'd  Nor by  Mapjobbers  wretchedly misplac'd  There lies an  Island  neither great nor small  Which for distinction sake I GOTHAM call  The Man who finds an unknown Country out  By giving it a name acquires no doubt  A Gospel title tho' the people there  The pious Christian thinks not worth his care  Bar this pretence and into air is hurl'd  The claim of EUROPE to the  Western World    Cast by a tempest on the savage coast  Some roving Buccaneer set up a Post  A Beam in proper form transversely laid  Of his Redeemer's Cross the figure made  Of that Redeemer with whose laws his life  From first to last had been one scene of strife  His royal master's name thereon engrav'd  Without more process the whole race enslav'd  Cut off that Charter they from Nature drew  And made them Slaves to men they never knew  Search antient histories consult records  Under this title the most Christian Lords  Hold thanks to Conscience more than half the Ball  O'erthrow this title they have none at all  For never yet might any Monarch dare  Who liv'd to Truth and breath'd a Christian air  Pretend that Christ who came we all agree  To bless his people and to set them free  To make a Convert ever one law gave  By which Converters made him first a slave  Spite of the glosses of a canting Priest  Who talks of Charity but means a feast  Who recommends it whilst he seems to feel  The holy glowings of a real zeal  To all his hearers as a deed of worth  To give them heav'n whom they have robb'd of earth  Never shall One One truly honest man  Who blest with LIBERTY reveres her plan  Allow one moment that a Savage sire  Could from his wretched race for childish hire  By a wild grant their All their Freedom pass  And sell his Country for a bit of glass  Or grant this barb'rous right Let SPAIN and FRANCE  In Slav'ry bred as purchasers advance  Let them whilst Conscience is at distance hurl'd  With some gay bawble buy a golden world  An ENGLISHMAN in  charter'd  FREEDOM born  Shall spurn the slavish merchandize shall scorn  To take from others thro' base private views  What He himself would rather die than lose  Happy the Savage of those  early  times  'Ere EUROPE's sons were known and EUROPE's crimes  Gold cursed Gold slept in the womb of earth  Unfelt its mischiefs as unknown its worth  In full Content he found the truest wealth  In Toil he found Diversion Food and Health  Strange to the ease and luxury of Courts  His Sports were Labours and his Labours Sports  His Youth was hardy and his Old Age green  Life's Morn was vig'rous and her Eve serene  No rules he held but what were made for use  No Arts he learn'd nor ills which Arts produce  False Lights he follow'd but believ'd them true  He knew not much but liv'd to what he knew  Happy thrice happy  now  the Savage race  Since EUROPE took their  Gold  and gave them  Grace  Pastors she sends to help them in their need  Some who can't write with others who can't read  And on sure grounds the Gospel Pile to rear  Sends  Missionary  Felons ev'ry Year  Our Vices with more Zeal than holy pray'rs  She teaches them and in return takes theirs  Her rank Oppressions give them cause to rise  Her Want of Prudence means and Arms supplies  Whilst her brave rage not satisfied with life  Rising in blood adopts the  ScalpingKnife    Knowledge She gives enough to make them know  How abject is their State how deep their Woe  The Worth of Freedom strongly She explains  Whilst She bows down and loads their necks with Chains  Faith too She plants for her own ends imprest  To make them bear the worst and hope the best  And whilst She teaches on vile int'rest's plan  As Laws of God the wild decrees of man  Like PHARISERS of whom the Scriptures tell  She makes them ten times more the Sons of Hell  But whither do these grave reflexions tend  Are they design'd for any or no end  Briefly but thisto prove that by no act  Which Nature made that by no equal pact  'Twixt Man and Man which might if Justice heard  Stand good that by no benefits conferr'd  Or purchase made EUROPE in chains can hold  The Sons of INDIA and her mines of gold  Chance led her there in an accursed hour  She saw and made the Country her's by pow'r  Nor drawn by Virtue's Love from Love of Fame  Shall my rash Folly controvert the claim  Or wish in thought that title overthrown  Which coincides with and involves my own  EUROPE discover'd INDIA first I found  My right to Gotham on the selfsame ground  I first discover'd it nor shall that plea  To Her be granted and denied to Me  I plead Possession and till one more bold  Shall drive me out will that Possession hold  With EUROPE's rights my kindred rights I twine  Hers  be the WESTERN WORLD be GOTHAM  Mine    Rejoice Ye happy GOTHAMITES rejoice  Lift up your voice on high a mighty voice  The voice of Gladness and on ev'ry tongue  In Strains of gratitude be praises hung  The praises of so great and good a King  Shall CHURCHILL reign and shall not GOTHAM sing  As on a Day a high and holy Day  Let ev'ry instrument of Music play  Antient  and  Modern  Those which drew their birth  Punctilios laid wide from  Pagan  earth  As well as those by  Christian  made and  Jew    Those known to many and those known to few  Those which in whim and frolic lightly float  And those which swell the slow and solemn note  Those which whilst Reason stands in wonder by  Make some  complexions  laugh and others cry  Those which by some strange faculty of sound  Can build walls up and raze them to the ground  Those which can tear up forests by the roots  And make brutes dance like Men and Men like brutes  Those which whilst RIDICULE leads up the dance  Make Clowns of MONMOUTH ape the Fops of FRANCE  Those which where  Lady  DULLNESS with  Lord  MAYORS  Prefides disdaining light and trifling airs  Hallow the feast with  Psalmody  and Those  Which planted in our Churches to dispose  And lift the mind to Heaven are disgrac'd  With what a foppish Organist calls  Taste    All from the Fiddle on which ev'ry Fool  The pert Son of dull Sire discharg'd from School  Serves an apprenticeship in College ease  And rises thro' the  Ganiut  to degrees  To Those which tho' less common not less sweet  From fam'd  Saint Giles's  and more fam'd  Vinestreet    Where Heav'n the utmost wish of man to grant  Gave me an old House and an older Aunt  THORNTON whilst HUMOUR pointed out the road  To her arch cub hath hitch'd into an ode  All Instruments attend Ye list'ning Spheres  Attend Ye Sons of Men and hear with ears  All Instruments nor shall they seek one Hand  Imprest from  modern  MUSIC's  coxcomb  band  All Instruments  selfacted  at my name  Shall pour forth harmony and loud proclaim  Loud but yet sweet to the according globe  My praises whilst  gay  NATURE in a robe  A  Coxcomb Doctor's robe  to the full sound  Keeps time like BOYCE and the World dances round  Rejoice Ye happy GOTHAMITES rejoice  Lift up your voice on high a mighty voice  The voice of gladness and on ev'ry tongue  In strains of gratitude be praises hung  The Praises of so great and good a King  Shall CHURCHILL reign and shall not GOTHAM sing  INFANCY straining backward from the breast  Tetchy and wayward what he loveth best  Refusing in his fits whilst all the while  The Mother eyes the wrangler with a smile  And the fond Father sits on t'other side  Laughs at his moods and views his spleen with pride  Shall murmur forth my name whilst at his hand  Nurse stands interpreter thro' GOTHAM's land  CHILDHOOD who like an  April  morn appears  Sunshine and Rain Hopes clouded o'er with fears  Pleas'd and displeas'd by starts in passion warm  In Reason weak who wrought into a storm  Like to the fretful bullies of the deep  Soon spends his rage and cries himself asleep  Who with a fev'rish appetite oppress'd  For trifles sighs but hates them when possess'd  His trembling lash suspended in the air  Halfbent and stroking back his long lank hair  Shall to his mates look up with eager glee  And let his Top go down to prate of Me  YOUTH who fierce fickle insolent and vain  Impatient urges on to MANHOOD's reign  Impatient urges on yet with a cast  Of dear regard looks back on CHILDHOOD past  In the  midchase  when the hot blood runs high  And the quick spirits mount into his eye  When Pleasure which he deems his greatest wealth  Beats in his heart and paints his cheeks with health  When the chaf'd Steed tugs proudly at the rein  And 'ere he starts hath run o'er half the plain  When wing'd with fear the Stag flies full in view  And in full cry the eager hounds pursue  Shall shout my praise to hills which shout again  And e'en the  Huntsman  stop to cry  Amen    MANHOOD of form erect who would not bow  Tho' Worlds should crack around him on his brow  WISDOM serene to Passion giving law  Bespeaking Love and yet commanding Awe  DIGNITY into Grace by Mildness wrought  COURAGE attemper'd and refin'd by Thought  VIRTUE supreme enthron'd within his breast  The Image of his Maker deep impress'd  Lord of this Earth which trembles at his Nod  With Reason bless'd and only less than God  MANHOOD tho' weeping Beauty kneels for aid  Tho' Honour calls in Danger's form array'd  Tho' cloath'd with sackcloth Justice in the gates  By wicked Elders chain'd Redemption waits  MANHOOD shall steal an hour a little hour  Is't not a little One to hail my pow'r  OLDAGE a  second Child  by Nature curs'd  With more and greater evils than the first  Weak sickly full of pains in ev'ry breath  Railing at life and yet afraid of death  Putting things off with sage and solemn air  From day to day without one day to spare  Without enjoyment covetous of pelf  Tiresome to friends and tiresome to himself  His faculties impair'd his temper sour'd  His memory of recent things devour'd  E'en with the acting on his shatter'd brain  Tho' the stale Registers of Youth remain  From morn to evening babbling forth vain praise  Of those rare men who liv'd in those rare days  When He the Hero of his tale was Young  Dull Repetitions falt'ring on his tongue  Praising gray hairs sure mark of Wisdom's sway  E'en whilst he curses time which made him gray  Scoffing at Youth e'en whilst he would afford  All but his gold to have his Youth restor'd  Shall for a moment from himself set free  Lean on his Crutch and pipe forth praise to Me  Rejoice Ye happy GOTHAMITES rejoice  Lift up your voice on high a mighty voice  The voice of gladness and on ev'ry tongue  In strains of gratitude be praises hung  The praises of so great and good a King  Shall CHURCHILL reign and shall not GOTHAM sing  Things without life shall in this Chorus join  And dumb to others' praise be loud in mine  The  Snowdrop  who in habit white and plain  Comes on the  Herald  of fair FLORA's train  The Coxcomb  Crocus  flow'r of simple note  Who by her side struts in a  Herald  's coat  The  Tulip  idly glaring to the view  Who tho' no Clown his birth from Holland drew  Who once fulldress'd fears from his place to stir  The Fop of flow'rs the MORE of a Parterre  The  Woodbine  who her  Elm  in marriage meets  And brings her dowry in surrounding sweets  The  Lilly  silver Mistress of the vale  The  Rose  of SHARON which perfumes the gale  The  Jessamine  with which the Queen of flow'rs  To charm her God adorns his fav'rite bow'rs  Which Brides by the plain hand of neatness drest  Unenvied rival wear upon their breast  Sweet as the incense of the Morn and chaste  As the pure Zone which circles DIAN's waist  All flow'rs of various names and various forms  Which the Sun into strength and beauty warms  From the dwarf  Daisy  which like infants clings  And fears to leave the earth from whence it springs  To the proud Giant of the garden race  Who madly rushing to the Sun's embrace  O'ertops her fellows with aspiring aim  Demands his wedded Love and bears his name  All One and All shall in this Chorus join  And dumb to others' praise be loud in mine  Rejoice Ye happy GOTHAMITES rejoice  Lift up your voice on high a mighty voice  The voice of gladness and on ev'ry tongue  In strains of gratitude be praises hung  The praises of so great and good a King  Shall CHURCHILL reign and shall not GOTHAM sing  Forming a gloom thro' which to spleenstruck minds  Religion horrorstamp'd a passage finds  The  Ivy  crawling o'er the hallow'd cell  Where some old Hermit's wont his beads to tell  By day by night the  Myrtle  evergreen  Beneath whose shade Love holds his rites unseen  The  Willow  weeping o'er the fatal wave  Where many a Lover finds a watry grave  The  Cypress  sacred held when Lovers mourn  Their true Love snatch'd away the  Laurel  worn  By Poets in old time but destin'd now  In grief to wither on a WHITEHEAD's brow  The  Fig  which large as what in India grows  Itself a Grove gave our first Parents cloaths  The  Vine  which like a blushing newmade Bride  Clust'ring empurples all the Mountain's side  The  Yew  which in the place of sculptur'd stone  Marks out the restingplace of men unknown  The hedgerow  Elm  the  Pine  of mountain race  The  Fir  the SCOTCH  Fir  never out of place  The  Cedar  whose top mates the highest cloud  Whilst his old Father LEBANON grows proud  Of such a child and his vast Body laid  Out many a mile enjoys the filial shade  The  Oak  when living monarch of the wood  The ENGLISH  Oak  which dead commands the flood  All One and All shall in this Chorus join  And dumb to others' praise be loud in mine  Rejoice Ye happy GOTHAMITES rejoice  Lift up your voice on high a mighty voice  The voice of gladness and on ev'ry tongue  In strains of gratitude be praises hung  The praises of so great and good a King  Shall CHURCHILL reign and shall not GOTHAM sing  The  Show'rs  which make the young hills like young Lambs  Bound and rebound the old Hills like old Rams  Unwieldy jump for joy the  Streams  which glide  Whilst PLENTY marches smiling by their side  And from their bosom rising COMMERCE springs  The  Winds  which rise with healing on their wings  Before whose cleansing breath Contagion flies  The  Sun  who travelling in Eastern skies  Fresh full of strength just risen from his bed  Tho' in JOVE's pastures they were born and bred  With voice and whip can scarce make his steeds stir  Step by Step up the perpendicular  Who at the hour of Eve panting for rest  Rolls on amain and gallops down the West  As fast as JEHU oil'd for AHAB's sin  Drove for a crown or  Postboys  for an Inn  The  Moon  who holds o'er night her silver reign  Regent of tides and Mistress of the Brain  Who to her Sons those Sons who own her pow'r  And do her homage at the midnight hour  Gives madness as a blessing but dispenses  Wisdom to fools and damns them with their Senses  The  Stars  who by I know not what strange right  Preside o'er mortals in their own despite  Who without Reason govern Those who most  How truly judge from hence of Reason boast  And by some mighty Magic yet unknown  Our actions guide yet cannot guide their own  All One and All shall in this Chorus join  And dumb to others' praise be loud in Mine  Rejoice Ye happy GOTHAMITES rejoice  Lift up your voice on high a mighty voice  The voice of gladness and on ev'ry tongue  In strains of gratitude be praises hung  The praises of so great and good a King  Shall CHURCHILL reign and shall not GOTHAM sing  The  Moment Minute Hour Day Week Month Year    Morning  and  Eve  as they in turn appear  Moments  and  Minutes  which without a crime  Can't be omitted in accounts of time  Or if omitted proof we might afford  Worthy by Parliaments to be restor'd  The  Hours  which drest by turns in black and white  Ordain'd as Handmaids wait on Day and Night  The  Day  those hours I mean when Light presides  And BUSINESS in a cart with PRUDENCE rides  The  Night  those hours I mean with darkness hung  When Sense speaks free and Folly holds her tongue  The  Morn  when Nature rousing from her strife  With deathlike sleep awakes to second life  The  Eve  when as unequal to the task  She mercy from her foe descends to ask  The  Week  in which Six days are kindly given  To think of Earth and One to think of Heaven  The  Months  twelve Sisters all of diff'rent hue  Tho' there appears in all a likeness too  Not such a likeness as thro' HAYMAN's works  Dull Mannerist in Christians Jews and Turks  Cloys with a sameness in each female face  But a strange Something born of Art and Grace  Which speaks them All to vary and adorn  At diff'rent times of the same Parents born  All One and All shall in this Chorus join  And dumb to others' praise be loud in Mine  Rejoice Ye happy GOTHAMITES rejoice  Lift up your voice on high a mighty voice  The voice of gladness and on ev'ry tongue  In strains of gratitude be praises hung  The praises of so great and good a King  Shall CHURCHILL reign and shall not GOTHAM sing  Frore JANUARY Leader of the year  Minc'dpies  in van and  Calvesheads  in the rear  Dull  February  in whose leaden reign  My Mother bore a bard without a brain  MARCH various fierce and wild with windcrack'd cheeks  By wilder Welchmen led and crown'd with leeks  APRIL with fools and MAY with bastards blest  JUNE with White Roses on her rebel breast  JULY to whom the DogStar in her train  Saint  JAMES gives oysters and  Saint  SWITHIN rain  AUGUST who banish'd from her  Smithfield  stand  To  Chelsea  flies with DOGGET in her hand  SEPTEMBER when by Custom right divine  Geese are ordain'd to bleed at MICHAEL's shrine  Whilst the Priest not so full of grace as wit  Falls to unbless'd nor gives the Saint a bit  OCTOBER who the cause of FREEDOM join'd  And gave a  second  GEORGE to bless mankind  NOVEMBER who at once to grace our earth  Saint  ANDREW boasts and our AUGUSTA's birth  DECEMBER last of Months but best who gave  A CHRIST to Man a Saviour to the Slave  Whilst falsely grateful Man at the full feast  To do God honour makes himself a beast  All One and All shall in this Chorus join  And dumb to others' praise be loud in Mine  Rejoice Ye happy GOTHAMITES rejoice  Lift up your voice on high a mighty voice  The voice of gladness and on ev'ry tongue  In strains of gratitude be praises hung  The praises of so great and good a King  Shall CHURCHILL reign and shall not GOTHAM sing  The  Seasons  as they roll SPRING by her side  Letch'ry  and  Lent LayFolly  and  ChurchPride    By a rank Monk to Copulation led  A tub of  sainted SaltFish  on her head  SUMMER in light transparent Gawze array'd  Like Maids of Honour at a Masquerade  In bawdry Gawze for which our daughters leave  The Fig more modest first brought up by EVE  Panting for breath enflam'd with lustful fires  Yet wanting strength to perfect her desires  Leaning on SLOTH who fainting with the heat  Stops at each step and slumbers on his feet  AUTUMN when NATURE who with sorrow feels  Her dread foe Winter treading on her heels  Makes up in value what she wants in length  Exerts her pow'rs and puts forth all her strength  Bids Corn and Fruits in full perfection rise  Corn Fairly Tax'd and Fruits without Excise  WINTER benumb'd with cold no longer known  By robes of Fur since Furs became  our own    A Hag who loathing all by all is loath'd  With weekly daily hourly libels cloath'd  Vile FACTION at her heels who mighty grown  Would rule the Ruler and  foreclose  the throne  Would turn all Stateaffairs into a trade  Make Laws one day the next to be Unmade  Beggar at home a People fear'd abroad  And force defeated make them Slaves by Fraud  All One and All shall in this Chorus join  And dumb to other's praise be loud in Mine  Rejoice Ye happy GOTHAMITES rejoice  Lift up your voice on high a mighty voice  The voice of gladness and on ev'ry tongue  In strains of gratitude be praises hung  The praises of so great and good a King  Shall CHURCHILL reign and shall not GOTHAM sing  The  Year  Grand Circle in whose ample round  The Seasons regular and fix'd are bound  Who in his course repeated o'er and o'er  Sees the same things which he had seen before  The same  Stars  keep their Watch and the same Sun  Runs in the track where he from first hath run  The same Moon rules the night Tides ebb and flow  Man  is a Puppet and this World a Show  Their old dull follies old dull fools pursue  And Vice in nothing but in Mode is new  Hea Lord now fair befall that Pride  He liv'd a Villain but a Lord he died  DASHWOOD is  pious  BERKLEY  fix'd as fate    SANDWICH THANK HEAV'N first Minister of

Churchill reign and shall not GOTHAM sing  Thus far in Sportnor let our Critics hence  Who sell out monthly trash and call it Sense  Too lightly of our present labours deem  Or judge at random of so high a Theme  High is our Theme and worthy are the men  To feel the sharpest stroke of Satire's Pen  But when kind Time a proper season brings  In serious mood to treat of serious things  Then shall they find disdaining idle play  That I can be as grave and dull as They  Thus far in Sportnor let half Patriots those  Who shrink from ev'ry blast of Pow'r which blows  Who with tame Cowardice familiar grown  Would hear my thoughts but fear to speak their own  Who lest bold Truths to do sage Prudence spite  Should burst the Portals of their lips by night  Tremble to trust themselves one hour in sleep  Condemn our course and hold our Caution cheap  When brave Occasion bids for some great end  When Honour calls the Poet as a Friend  Then shall They find that e'en on danger's brink  He dares to Speak what they scarce dare to Think  END OF THE FIRST BOOK
