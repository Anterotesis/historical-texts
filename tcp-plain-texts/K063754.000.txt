 PEACE IGNOMINY AND DESTRUCTION A POEM  INSCRIBED TO THE RT HON CHARLES JAMES FOX  Rompez rompez tout pacte avec l'impiété  RACINE  LONDON  PRINTED FOR F AND C RIVINGTON ST PAUL'S CHURCH YARD AND R WHITE NO PICCADILLY    TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE CHARLES JAMES FOX  SIR  I CANNOT pay the Candour that accompanies your great Talents a higher Compliment than by dedicating to you a Poem whose general Principle is adverse to your political Sentiments  I have the honour to be Your obedient humble Servant THE AUTHOR  PEACE IGNOMINY AND DESTRUCTION  AROUND th' enduring martyr's hallow'd shrine  Their brightest flowers the holy Muses twine  With roses blushing from the fields of war  Their skilful hands adorn the victor's car  And for the candid brow of peace they bring  The modest honours of the early spring  But for the peace that lifts th' imploring eye  From whose frail breast escapes the coward's sigh  No muse applauding one small leaf shall bring  Of all the foliage of the early spring  But from her bow'r shall Ignominy rend  A branch of nightshade for her  gentle  friend  THESE painful eyes behold an English Peer  His weak Memorial sicklied o'er with fear  In humble attitude a suppliant stand  To claim the friendship of a murd'rous band  The plaintive breathings of the snowwing'd dove  Ill suit the imperial messenger of Jove  Who should by longexcited vengeance driv'n  Bear in his grasp the thunderbolt of heav'n  OH my lov'd country timeennobled realm  Where jealous honour still has watch'd the helm  Th' unclouded glory long to Europe known  Which clasps thy loins like a refulgent zone  Say will thy hand the hallow'd cestus tear  And yield thy virtue to the tainting air  For meunmark'd by honours wealth or fame  No swelling title blazoning round my name  To be a fleeting bubble of thy earth  Inflames my mounting soul with pride of birth  Oh sacred parent still thyself revere  To honour's call to virtue's voice be near  Blur not the brightness of thy heav'nly cause  With one dim moment's intervening pause  Better to fall in glory's full career  Embracing honour on th' untimely bier  Than weak subdued with agonising strife  Waste in the socket the last gleams of life  Say if to cloathe with light the laughing skies  The God of Day were doom'd no more to rise  Were it not better in the pomp of pow'r  In the rich ardour of meridian hour  To rush abrupt from heav'n with downward flight  A flaming chaos to the jaws of night  Than tinge the ocean with a ling'ring ray  Expiring in the silence of decay  YET think not France from nature will depart  And chace the fiend that grapples to her heart  That the wild tigress will forego her prey  Couch with the kid and with the lambkin play  That the fond child shall stretch his little hand  To lead the lion in a flowr'y band  These beauteous emblems of the days of old  With this mock concord no resemblance hold  No heavy drops of mandragora steep  The dragon's eyelids in the dews of sleep  The gift extended by a faithless foe  Is the concealment of a lurking woe  'Tis like the pause that Nature's storm bestows  An awful calmthe thunder's dread repose  MY anxious eyes solicit still in vain  Some sign that might my failing hopes sustain  Some sacred altar rob'd in spotless white  Where candour's priest performs the genial rite  Where longtried statesmen fraught with wisdom's lore  Whose hair the hand of peace hath silver'd o'er  With learned fathers sway'd by virtue's rule  Whom peace hath tutor'd in religion's school  Where pensive as they walk'd the holy breeze  Flew through the shady cloister whisp'ring peace  For these best pledges other scenes arise  Th' enchanter's cauldron smites my wond'ring eyes  Behold a troop of ghastly shapes advance  In frantic mood and form a horrid dance  Now bending low these haggard forms of hell  Breathe the dark pray'r and mutter the dread spell  And now into the turbid stream they throw  With imprecations big with future woe  The galling tears that flow'd from beauty's cheek  The voice of agony and terror's shriek  The blood that trickled from affliction's dart  The sighs exhaling from a broken heart  The burst of anguish murder's piercing cry  The screams that hurried thro' the midnight sky  The famish'd infant's deep expiring groan  The dungeon'd victim's solitary moan  The clotted hair which desperation tore  The milk of murder'd mothers streak'd with gore  The plaint of innocence the virgin's pray'r  Which the rude ravisher consign'd to air  The hallow'd edicts by religion plann'd  And holy wedlock's desecrated band  Behold the infernal sorcerers unite  To close their incantation's fearful rite  And leering cast into the vase prosound  The likeness of two skulls which once were crown'd  SAY for these fiends if England can descend  To weave the bond that grapples friend to friend  Flown is the spirit of her living fame  And what remainsa carcase of a name  COU'D I like DRYDEN wield the bolts of war  Or boast the warm exuberance of PARR  The glow of mind the piercing ray of heav'n  By nature's liberal hand to ORFORD giv'n  The zeal of him whose energetic strain  Unfolds the sorrows of the negro train  Brings the heartrending tale to Britain's ear  And bids compassion pay her long arrear  The arguments that flow from WYNDHAM'S sense  Well guarded round by reason's strongest fence  The sacred boon by CHATHAM'S SON possest  The muse of eloquence that sires his breast  The quiver richly stored with attic darts  Which genius to his SHERIDAN imparts  Th' exalting winnow'd purity of soul  With which FITZWILLIAM soars beyond controul  Who greatly daring with a zeal severe  Stemm'd the wild deluge of opprobious fear  And on the day eternally renown'd  Like ABDIEL was the only faithful found  Had I these pow'rs concenter'd in one form  I'd pour on England the resistless storm  To wake her soul to rouse her mental part  And chace her sombrous lethargy of heart  Do some pretend that justice holds the scales  That o'er French councils honour now prevails  Approach the dial in the dead of night  Demand the hour by artificial light  Then virtue seek with an inquiring eye  Amid the system unillum'd from high  November the th The Convention decreed that a spot of ground should be allotted for a burial pla  with this inscription "Death is an eternal Sleep"  Mark yon sad cemetery's starless gloom  Where time shall ne'er unlock the rav'nous tomb  Where shadowy death shall a dread vigil keep  'Midst the still horror of eternal sleep  There the pledg'd maiden at th' approach of eve  O'er the dear relics of the youth shall grieve  While her dark creed shall urge the sting of woe  And bid her flowing tears for ever flow  Hope dares not whisper to her clouded eye  To send a glance to time's unsolding sky  Where pity weaves the amaranthine chain  To circle lovers ne'er to part again  THERE too the mother with affliction wild  Bends o'er the grave that holds her darling child  For ever holdsNo pleasing vision cries  "Suppress the tears that trickle from thine eyes  "Ah know thy child with angels soars on high  "In the bright regions of the upper sky  "And deck'd with wings that glitter to the ray  "Plays on the sunbeams of eternal day"  Her dark'ning creed with no assuagement fraught  Forbids her soul to grasp the cheering thought  THERE too the friend his otherself shall mourn  From his habitual sight for ever torn  Forbid to look to that celestial shore  Whose blissful bow'rs shall friend to friend restore  Thus the strong chain their sacrilege has riv'n  Which bound in sacred union earth and heav'n  Made ev'ry future high reversion void  The rights of immortality destroy'd  Compell'd the claims of merit to be mute  Creation's lord degraded to a brute  And what their hellconstructed thought design'd  Insulted nature and dethron'd the mind  July the th VOLTAIRE'S ashes were removed to St Geneviéve  BEHOLD here flow'rets deck the length'ning way  The slow procession moves in bright array  A gorgeous spectacle ovation's car  Press'd by no hero slaughter'd in the war  But press'd by him who scatter'd wild alarm  And rais'd 'gainst virtue his destructive arm  Who dar'd on truth's bright shield in evil hour  The poison'd shafts of blasphemy to show'r  His ardent vot'riesa licentious crowd  Uplift their champion fest'ring in his shroud  And while the graveworms fasten on his frame  High honours pay to his irrev'rent name  Pale Irreligion comes with all her train  Her atheist choirto act the rites profane  She comes with all the witlings of the land  Her grave Buffoons her academic band  The steps of the fam'd Porch they now ascend  And through the pillar'd Isles their march they bend  An host of praiseful voices rends the Fane  And impious echoes multiply the strain  But when the corse was to the vault convey'd  Night round the temple flung her darkest shade  With terror heav'd the sympathetic ground  From every altar breath'd a sigh profound  And fiends rejoic'd while angels wept around  TIME was when France preferred her learned name  And wore the wreath bestow'd by classic fame  Mark the dread changethe cold immoral blast  Has chill'd the plants of science as it pass'd  Nipt the young thought just bursting from its fold  And froze instruction's current as it roll'd  SEE education weeping on the ground  Her globes her torch her emblems scatter'd round  Her children all are fledthe path that leads  To her august abode is choak'd with weeds  She mourns her sabbaths and her rites suppress'd  She mourns her silent hours' ignoble rest  Who now appears the tutoress of youth  To cheer the darken'd mind with beams of truth  With those clear rays which her bright noon adorn  To streak and beautify her pupil's morn  FROM the wideyawning ground now bursts to view  A form gigantic and of sable hue  'Tis Inhumanityshe comes to trace  Instruction's precepts to the rising race  She feasts their mindsnot with theatric show  But with live scenes of dire ensanguin'd woe  Gluts their affections with atrocious food  With acts of wrath and festivals of blood  A battalion of children from ten to eleven were organised at Rennes who were made to shoot old men of eighty  Behold her children new to war's alarms  At her commandment grasp their little arms  Behold yon aged group whose silver hair  Demands compassion and intreats to spare  'Gainst thesewhose crimes are poverty and age  She bids her pupils act their virgin rage  And as they now impel the deathwing'd balls  Some benefactor or some parent falls  With horror's deep'ning dye so early stain'd  In massacrous employ so early train'd  Will they not terrify the future day  Whose rudiments of vice such proofs display  'Gainst these to war is Virtue's best crusade  She cries "Oh England hasten to my aid  "See atheist cruelty her weapons wield  "Lift to her blow thy consecrated shield"  OH that the warning voice to me was giv'n  Which once resounded through the vault of heav'n  Woe to the sons of Earth  I would o'erwhelm  With sudden terror the unconscious realm  Till grasping one great plan by truth design'd  The will of many gath'ring to one mind  With courage added to prophetic fear  She should to France an iron aspect wear  WOE to the land which shamefully secure  Shrinks from the toil that wisdom bids endure  Declines the steps of glory to retrace  And shuns calamity to meet disgrace  Misfortune is the night expecting day  Disgrace a stain that seas can't wash away  See  Jeremiah  chapter  A VOICE prophetic smote the passive air  And cried to Media  Haste prepare prepare  Resume the shields and make the arrows bright  Direct to Babylon their hasty flight  Oh thou who fill'st the trembling earth with woe  Destroying mountain I'm thy dreadful foe  I will put forth my arm and thou shal't rush  With flaming ruin and descending crush  Deep to th' intombing vale  Cou'd England hear  The sound perchance wou'd vibrate on her ear  And she referring to that ruinous pow'r  Would catch the lesson of the present hour  Like Media she would dart a threat'ning eye  Proud to perform the menace from on high  And cry to heav'n as she ascends the car  "Thou art my battleaxe my strength of war"  THEN cease oh Britain timeennobled land  Cease to implore what virtue can't demand  Yes I adjure thee by thy days of yore  By thine illustrious fame's untainted store  By all the rev'rence thy great statesmen claim  Who rais'd on wisdom's plan thy wond'rous frame  By all thy sons who in thy cause have bled  By all the tears their drooping widows shed  By all thy sacred bards whose magic lays  Sound in thy porch and dignify thy praise  By thy benevolencethat brilliant gem  Whose lustre plays around thy diadem  By all the charities that most endear  By Emigrancy's meek imploring tear  Thou'lt not reject her at her utmost need  Nor plant thy footsteps on the broken reed  Yes I adjure thee by the sainted train  Who heav'ninstructed rear'd thy awful fane  Who for imperial Rome's gay pomp of lights  Her pageant altars and her scenic rites  Gave to thy holy lips a purer pray'r  Whose chaste ascension breathes celestial air  OFT' when in vain the art of med'cine strives  How nature trusting to herself revives  Sowou'd our busy stateempirics cease  To pour the opium of reposing peace  England would start from her ignoble ease  And rise superior to her new disease  And boldly grasp the madd'ning arm of France  Alluding to AGAVE who in a delirium slew her childSee Ovid's Metamorphosis book iii  'Till like AGAVE wak'ning from her trance  She trembling casts her haggard eyes around  And views her infant bleeding on the ground  BUT if cold reason with her length'ning chain  Comes ev'ry vigorous purpose to restrain  Ah then no time can England's fame restore  The curtain drops and glory's scene is o'er  Resign'd submissive to my humbler  tate  Excluded from the conclave of the state  It cheers me to reflect I'm not decreed  To make this bond of peace my act and deed  'Ere I wou'd fix th'irrevocable seal  And legalise what shame can ne'er repeal  See a tedious composition in rhyme intitled "The Progress of Civil Society"  I'd be the wretch whose infidel designs  Creep in his mawkish cold lethargic lines  Who meanly caters from dim reason's ray  While bright religion pours a flood of day  Who from the gates of wisdom turns aside  And takes Lucretius for his moral guide  I'd rather by the nine accurst produce  The harsh crab vintage of the Baviad muse  Whose cynic numbers not devoid of art  Spring from the workings of a bilious heart  Coarse unrefin'd inelegantly keen  The foul o'erflowings of selftortur'd spleen  THOU who hast long attain'd th'immortal goal  While choral plaudits sound from pole to pole  The glowing sunset of whose honour'd day  Expands the brilliance of meridian ray  Who hast from states remov'd th' incumbent shade  And the wide sphere of government display'd  The distant azure of whose vague extremes  Thou hast illum'd with Truth's unerring beams  Our houshold deity who warns foretells  Points to the den where the hush'd monster dwells  Presents our perils awfully to view  And bids the Country to herself be true  Oh Sage of  Beaconsfield  indulge the muse  Who the same track thou hast adorn'd pursues  Who gleans thy scatt'rings grasps the falling grain  From the full harvest of thy loaded wane  THE END
