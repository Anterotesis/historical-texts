Gusto  Cran  A good song and a bottle that's my Gusto I am an Englishman Cecilia I like an English song and I'd rather hear the simple nervous strains of an honest Tar in praise of a Rodney a Hood or

away rattling in his visavis like a Venetion AmbassadorTomorrow perch'd up in a high Phaeton peeping into the people's garret windowsNow in his powdered gown like a French Barber and then you see him sliding down the Mall in a pye bald coatBuckles from the shewglass in Exeterchange and the face of a waiting maid under the hat of a Russian trooper  Cec  Believe me sir Mr Vinegar's outre description is a most monstrous Caricatura He judges of a gentleman with his narrow ruffles and twelve gray hairs tied up in a bassa bag  Cran  You love this Bouquet then  Cec  I do sir I frankly own it  Cran  Well Child I like your candour You shall go with me into the country child and I warrant there the beautiful revolutions of the seasons will crase him from your heart  Cec  Ah dear papa never never  Cran  Cecilia I tell you this I love you as a parent ought and therefore I never will approve of Mr Bouquet's addresses till he forsakes fashion and foppery and returns to his hopyards in kent and his counting house in St Mary Aix  Cec  Indeed papa you are extremely cruel to me my soul is never possessed of the lov'd idea of my sweet Bouquet that you don't sour my temper with old Vinegar and when I sondly imagine every obstacle to my happiness removed you throw a hop packet in my way and cut off my darling hope with an odious simmery aix  Cran  You know child I mean it all for  Cec  Oh sir
