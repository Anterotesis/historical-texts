 SECRETS WORTH KNOWING A COMEDY IN FIVE ACTS  AS PERFORMED AT THE  THEATRE ROYAL COVENT GARDEN  By THOMAS MORTON Esq  AUTHOR OF COLUMBUS CHILDREN IN THE WOOD CURE FOR THE HEART ACHE c c  LONDON PRINTED FOR TN LONGMAN PATERNOSTER ROW    PRICE TWO SHILLINGS  PROLOGUE  FROM Dryden's period to our present days  Thus would becritics censure modern plays  Some are too dull without intrigue or jest  And some mere speaking pantomimes at best  That living authors are by dead surpast  So he must write the worst who writes the last  Still each new drama captiously they blame  And though the town be pleas'd deny it same  Should this decision be allow'd as just  The bays denied the Bard may grace his bust  But if this taste for antiques we pursue  Age may improve wit wine and women too  One  old opinion  we would still retain  The right that England has to rule the main  Long as the sea shall fence our envied land  Long as our navy shall the sea command  So long shall Howe's St Vincent's Duncan's name  Be grav'd by memory on the rock of same  The page of hist'ry shall their deeds repeat  With Britain's triumph and the foe's defeat  But ah the pensive muse with tearful eye  Views glory's brightest triumph with a sigh  And midst the shouts victorious fleets attend  Mourns o'er the ashes of an honoured friend  Who in his country's quarrel fought and bled  By England numbered with her patriot dead  May war's alarms midst rival nations cease  And all embrace that lovely strangerPeace  Whose olive branch once planted by her hand  Shall bless a loyal brave and happy land  This night our Author's hopes on you are placed  His former efforts by your smiles were graced  To your decree submissively he bends  Trusting his judges will be found his friends  DRAMATIS PERSONAE

this Our old master being dead and our young one expected every moment from abroad ought we when he arrives to laugh or cry Hear the Cook  Cook  Why I thinks that for the death of an old master a little dripping from the eyes would be quite natural  Valet  It may be natural master Cook but lord bless you the genteel feel of your tip top folks is no more like nature than one of your fine kabobbed fricassees is to plain roast and  taties  Besides when a man leaves behind him a good ten thousand a year I think it quite natural for the heir to laugh What say you Coachy  Coach  I pulls

writers of the Analytical Review for January last say "The work before us will be found particularly interesting to those who wish to obtain an idea of the management of state affairs in this country during the whole of the present reign"  The writers of the Gentleman's Magazine for January last say "These volumes are written by the author of the Anecdotes of the late Earl of Chatham and are not inferior to that work either in interest or intelligence Those persons who are fond of reading the political anecdotes of their own times particularly from the year to the year an important period

thanks of the public for preserving many facts which otherwise might have fallen into oblivion The reader will find entertainment and information in them and the future investigator of the acts of the
