 To the RIGHT HONOURABLE The MAYOR and ALDERMEN of the City of  LONDON  The Humble Petition Of the Colliers  Cooks    CookMaids    Blacksmiths    Jackmakers    Brasiers  and Others  SHEWETH  _THAT whereas certain  Virtuosi  Disaffected to the Government and to the Trade and Prosperity of this Kingdom taking upon them the Name and Title of the CATOPTRICAL VICTUALLERS have presumed by Gathering Breaking Folding and Bundling up the SunBeams by the help of certain  Glasses  to Make Produce and Kindle up several New  Focus's  or Fires within these His Majesty's Dominions and thereby to Boil Bake Stew Fry and Dress all sorts of Victuals and Provisions to Brew Distil Spirits Smelt Oars and in general to perform all the Offices of Culinary Fires and are endeavouring to procure to themselves the Monopoly of this their said Invention We beg leave humbly to represent to your Honours  That such Grant or Patent will utterly  ain and reduce to Beggary your Petitioners their Wives Children Servants and Trades on them depending there being nothing left to them after the said Invention but Warming of Cellars and Dressing of Suppers in the Wintertime That the abolishing so considerable a branch of the Coasting Trade as that of the Colliers will destroy the Navigation of this Kingdom That whereas the said  Catoptrical Victuallers  talk of making use of the  Moon  by Night as of the  Sun  by Day they will utterly ruin the numerous Body of TallowChandlers and impair a very considerable branch of the Revenue which arises from the Tax upon Tallow and Candles  That the said  Catoptrical Victuallers  do profane the Emanations of that Glorious Luminary the  Sun  which is appointed to  Rule the Day  and not to  Roast Mutton  And we humbly conceive It will be found contrary to the known Laws of this Kingdom to Confine Forestall and Monopolize the Beams of the Sun And whereas the said  Catoptrical Victuallers  have undertaken by BurningGlasses made of Ice to Roast an Ox upon the  Thames  next Winter We conceive all such Practices to be an Encroachment upon the Rights and Privileges of the Company of  Watermen  That the Diversity of Exposition of the several Kitchins in this great City whereby some receive the Rays of the Sun sooner and others later will occasion great Irregularity as to the Time of Dining of the several Inhabitants and consequently great Uncertainty and Confusion in the dispatch of Business And to those who by reason of their Northern Exposition will be still forced to be at the Expences of Culinary Fires it will reduce the Price of their Manufacture to such Inequality as is inconsistent with common Justice And the same Inconveniency will affect Landlords in the Value of their Rents  That the Use of the said Glasses will oblige Cooks and CookMaids to study Opticks and Astronomy in order to know the due Distances of the said  Focus's  or Fires and to adjust the Position of their Glasses to the several Altitudes of the Sun varying according to the Hours of the Day and the Seasons of the Year which Studies at these Years will be highly Troublesome to the said Cooks and CookMaids not to say any thing of the utter Incapacity of some of them to go through with such difficult Arts or which is still a greater Inconveniency it will throw the whole Art of  Cookery  into the Hands of Astronomers and GlassGrinders Persons utterly unskill'd in other parts of that Profession to the great Detriment of the Health of His Majesty's good Subjects  That it is known by Experience That Meat Roasted with SunBeams is extreamly unwholesome witness several that have dy'd suddenly after eating the Provisions of the said  Catoptrical Victuallers  being that the SunBeams taken inwardly render the Humours too Hot and Adust occasion great Sweatings and dry up the Rectual Moisture  That SunBeams taken inwardly shed a Malignant Influence upon the Brain by their natural Tendency towards the Moon produce Madness and Destraction at the time of the Full Moon That the constant use of so great Quantities of this Inward Light will occasion the Growth of Quakerism to the Danger of the Church and Poetry to the Danger of the State  That the Influences of the Constellations through which the Sun passes will with his Beams be convey'd into the Blood and when the Sun is amongst the Horned Signs may produce such a Spirit of Unchastity as is dangerous to the Honour of your Worships Families  That Mankind living much upon the Seeds and other parts of Plants these being impregnated with the SunBeams may vegetate and grow in the Bowels a Thing of more dangerous Consequence to Human Bodies than Breeding of Worms and this will fall heaviest upon the Poor who live upon Roots and the Weak and Sickly who live upon Barley and RueGruel  c  for which we are ready to produce to your Honours the Opinions of Eminent Physicians That the Taste and Property of the Victuals is much alter'd to the worse by the said  Solar Cookery  the Fricasses being depriv'd of the  Haut Gout  they acquire by being dress'd over Charcoal  Lastly  Should it happen by an Eclipse of an Extraordinary Length that this City should be depriv'd of the SunBeams for several Months how will His Majesty's Subjects subsist in the Interim when common Cookery with the Arts depending upon it is totally lost  In Consideration of these and many other inconveniences your Petitioners humbly pray That your Honours would either totally prohibit the Confining and Manufacturing the SunBeams for any of the useful Purposes of Life or in the ensuing Parliament procure a Tax to be laid upon them which may answer both the Duty and Price of Coals and which we humbly conceive cannot be less than Thirty Shillings  per  Yard Square reserving the sole Right and Privilege of the  Catoptrical Cookery  to the  Royal Society  and to the Commanders and Crew of the BombVessels under the Direction of Mr  Whiston  for finding out the Longitude who by Reason of the Remoteness of their Nations may be reduc'd to Streights for want of Firing  And we likewise beg that your Honours as to the forementioned Points would hear the Reverend Mr  Flamsted  who is the Legal Officer appointed by the Government to  look after the Heavenly Luminaries  whom we have constituted our Trusty and Learned Solicitor  LONDON  Printed for J ROBERTS at the  OxfordArms
