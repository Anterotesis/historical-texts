 OBSERVATIONS  ON THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE CLERGY WHO ASSEMBLED AT CHESTER FEB TH FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUPPORTING THE  Corporation and Test Acts  IT is allowed that every State has an inherent right to require evidence that those whom it employs in offices of trust and power are friendly to its constitution because it is  to be supposed that any State would pursue measures destructive of itself which the admission  those who are hostile to it to civil offices would undoubtedly be It therefore follows di  ly that some security should be given of the allegiance of those who are so employed But  question is what security It cannot be supposed that the State has a right to  any  and  every  At a Meeting of the Clergy of the Archdeaconry of Chester held at the city of Chester on Monday the th  of February to take into consideration the attempts of the Dissenters in various parts of the king    to obtain a repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts  and their assertions that those acts  are acknowledged by  of the established Clergy to be a grievance and a common evil  the following Resolutions were agreed to  ANIMOUSLY The Rev Archdeacon TRAVIS in the Chair  That every state hath an inherent right to require evidence of the opinions of those whom it shall em  in its offices of trust and power  whether they are friendly or hostile to the constitution which it hath established  that this right arises not merely from laws which may have been enacted by that state but from that  principle  selfpreservation which belongs to communities as well as to individuals  and which is antecedent and superior to  law  kind of security For instance it cannot claim a right to such security as would make the punishment of disaffection more than adequate to the crime Nor can it claim a right to such a dominion over conscience as would lead to persecution for religious sentiments considered merely  as  sentiments The same observation will hold with respect to all opinions which have not an  immediate  connection with the welfare of the State itself Otherwise in deducing consequences from opinions which are supposed to have a more remote relation to the State it will be impossible to know where to stop there being scarcely one principle of a political moral or religious nature but may be represented by its enemies as inconsistent with the established government And as various governments are guided by various principles those which are consistent with one government may be inconsistent with another on which supposition the opinions which in one State may be regarded as just and necessary to the support of the community may in another be considered as destructive of all order and due subordination The consequence of which would be that there could be no such thing as political truth or rectitude existing  But let us suppose the government to be well calculated to advance the general interests of the community let the opinions of which it requires a security be just opinions yet if they are such as have not clearly and  immediately  this connection the State can have no right to claim any evidence of their being admitted by those whom it employs in civil offices So that both in this and in the former case these opinions will be found to include in reality nothing more than what is implied in the common oaths of allegiance and fid  lity and a claim of security as to such opinions as these is what no one would object to complying withthough even this is more than can be justly pretended to For the very supposition of a claim to security in  opinions  is in itself absurd Indeed what does it at the utmost amount to Merely this that those from whom such a security is required should declare their  belief  such opinions But will any State pretend to judge of the sincerity of such a declaration When prospects of interest are placed before him who makes it can it be positively known that these have no influence to bias his mind and lead him to concealments and reservations I do not pretend to say that this is always or generally the fact but the very possibility is a clear proof how inadequate Government is to such a claim and consequently that the security it should require is of a different kinda security of  conduct  This is the only test on which the community can reasonably depend and on this it may depend especially if personal interest be connected with such conduct which it certainly is when the measures of government are generally useful to the community Every other evidence is delusive and therefore this only ought to be required  In determining also the  extent  of this security it is a question of essential importance what is meant by the  constitution  to which it is referred For this may either be considered as the whole system of laws which make up the Government at  the time of giving the security  or the general  spirit  and  design  of the Government without reference to any  particular laws  whatever Now for the support of the former no one can be expected to engage because on this principle no grievances can be redressed nor even can a single statute be ever abrogated It must be the latter only then to which those who are employed in civil offices may be expected to give evidence of attachment It therefore by no means follows that they may not endeavour the repeal of any statutes which appear to them inconsistent with the spirit of the government though of ever so long a standing and ever so uniformly acquiesced in And whenever such expressions are used with respect to the executive part of Government as convey the idea of obligation on those who are employed in it to  preserve the constitution  the whole meaning is that the general spirit of the government shall be uniformly supported and the laws enacted from time to time shall be put in execution agreeably to the letter and design of them The utmost security therefore that can be given is that this delegation shall be faithfully executed which it  certainly may by  all  what sentiments soever they may entertain as to matters of religion or philosophy  The principle also on which this security is said to be claimed that of  selfpreservation  is an additional proof that this claim can be extended no farther For this principle is to be restricted in societies as well as individuals by reason and justice Now neither of these can warrant the claim of more security than is necessary in this case If therefore a solemn engagement on the part of a person appointed to civil offices that he will discharge these offices truly and faithfully be just and complete no other ought to be required For the claims of society and government are not to be regarded as  indefinite  but are to be regulated by the same principles of morality as those of individuals and whenever they are exorbitant ought to be remonstrated against and opposed  On these accounts the principle which makes the first of the resolutions of the Chester Clergy ought to have been expressed in this manner  "Every State though it has an inherent right to a security from those whom it may employ in offices of trust and power that they will not pursue measures hostile to the constitution which it has established has only that right which it is competent to the exertion of namely the engaging its officers by a solemn promise that that they will not  act  inconsistently with the interests of the State This right arises from the nature of the society itself and from the principle of selfpreservation But as to  opinions  these being out of the reach of human knowledge must therefore be beyond the extent of human power and in these the State cannot from the nature of the things have any concern"  Hence therefore  That upon the same principle every state hath a right to declare what shall be deemed a sufficient proof or TEST whether such opinions are or are not friendly to its establishments  II No state has a right to any Test which has for its object  opinions  only or to one of which  opinions  make a part  I cannot help under this head remarking the palpable absurdity of the second resolution of the Chester clergy  "Every state hath a right to DECLARE what shall be DEEMED  I suppose this means deemed  by the state  for on these principles there can be  no judge besides the state  a sufficient PROOF or TEST whether such opinions are or are not friendly to its establishments"  I shall not take notice of the artful introduction of the  plural establishments  instead of the singular number which is the only idea expressed in the first resolution and which is referable to the  civil  establishment only nor shall I say any thing of the tendency of such an alteration to confound the church and state together and apply the arguments which relate merely to the latter to both of these collectively takenI will only ask the learned divines who composed that assembly on what logical principles this assertion is founded the plain meaning of which is precisely this  "  that the friendly or unfriendly nature of any opinions as to the establishments of civil government is to be judged of not by the intrinsic nature of these opinions but by the m  re DECLARATION of the STATE itself and that this declaration is to be admitted as a sufficient PROOF or TEST whatsoever be the nature of the opinions themselves  "  That a compliance with the tests of conformity which now subsist in this kingdom is required from those who are employed by the state as a pledge or security that they will not attempt any thing hostile to the established constitution that under this view such  Tests  are not punishments for an opinion but  restraints to prevent an evil  not instruments of oppression but  institutions to preserve the public peace  And we are so far from considering them as  "  grievances or common evils  "  that we think ourselves warranted from the experience of more than a century to express our desires that they may be continued in force or that some  other equivalent obligations  may be substituted in their place as wise and just provisions for the safety of the state  III Since therefore no state has a right to a test of  opinions  in any case it can have no right  to a declaration of conformity to the church of England as a qualification for offices Consequently though some pledge or security may be justly required that those who are employed by the state will not attempt any thing hostile to it this pledge or security must be of a  civil  nature only and can have no reference to the established church Therefore religious tests of all kinds are unlawful And whether they are intended as  restraints to prevent an evil  or institutions to  preserve the public peace  they cannot have place in any civil view Of consequence though they were even such as contained true and acknowledged principles only and consequently did not compel a single person to declare a belief of what he was not already persuaded of they would nevertheless be a grievance even on  this  supposition as being the application of a sanction to which no state can plead a right in any case whatever  If it be urged that the  church  also is concerned in this and that this religious test has also a tendency to preserve the  ecclesiastical constitution  the right to such test in this respect must depend upon one or more of these principlesthat an exclusive religious establishment is a right arising from the nature of society in general or from the nature of a  particular  society or from the nature of the British government But on the first principles since the rights of conscience are equal religious opinions as to their claims must be equal and consequently there cannot be a predominant established church consistently with the design of society and the unalienable rights of conscience nor can it arise from the nature of a particular society because either every religious establishment is a good one or some one is better than all the others The former of which suppositions as it totally destroys the idea of the importance of religious truth will be admitted by none but those who disregard religion altogether And the latter though true involves this question which of all the religio  s in the world that claim a right to establishment is the only true one and the only one calculated to advance the interests of society and just governmentWhen this question is satisfactorily answered so as to convince  all mankind  for less than this cannot establish the right pleaded for then the right of exclusive establishments may possibly deserve some attention  This is precisely the case as to the Church establishment in England Besides the obligation which lies upon its advocates to prove that its claims as an establishment are not incompatible with the equal and unalienable rights of conscience it ought to be shewn by them that the nature of the Church itself is the best formed to preserve and support the spirit of the Government to establish the rights of the people and to promote those principles of justice sobriety and due subordination without which no society can exist or flourish  It may be also a question of no small importance on supposition that the Church of England is the best calculated to support the British constitution what are we to think of the Scotch ecclesiastical establishment Have two establishments of a directly opposite nature a tendency to produce the same effect Or is it the nature of the Scotch establishment to destroy or impair the British constitution  Now without detracting from the merits of the Church in this respect I may venture to assert that all these principles are equally taught by every party of the Dissenters also and applied with at least as much consistence and force to the very same purposes All these sectaries therefore have an equal right to exclusive establishent with the Church of England But equal and contradictory rights are self destructive Therefore none of them not even the Church itself has a  right to an exclusive establishment If it be said in reply to this that their claims cannot be equal because the Members of the Church compose the majority of the nation it is a point which calls for all the proof which the Clergy can produce that the rights of conscience in the majority of a nation are necessarily and justly of such a kind as to infer a dominion over the rights of conscience in the rest of the nation  But these things the Dissenters do not contend for They are willing to contribute to the support even of the ministers of a Church which they disapprove provided they be not held up as bad subjects to the civil government in their principles or conduct And this they certainly are even on the supposition that the tests of conformity with which they cannot conscientiously comply are used as  restraints only to prevent an evil  apprehended from them and institutions  to preserve the public peace  which if they were admitted to civil offices would be in danger of being disturbed  The principles of the Dissenters as far as they relate to civil government are perfectly agreeable to the principles of the British constitution a constitution which they have always supported and which indeed in a great measure owes its present perfection to their services This is acknowledged by Mr Hume himself who though far from being friendly to the Dissenters bears this honourable testimony to them Hist v p that  "  the precious spark of liberty  was kindled and preserved by the Puritans  alone  and it was to this sect from whom the present Dissenters derive their origin that the English owe the  whole freedom of their constitution  "  Their  religious  principles at least those in which they  all  agree are reducible to these That as men and members of a religious community all mankind have equal rights of conscience that persecution of every kind even to the lowest degree of civil restraint on account of religious sentiments is unjust and unlawful and that therefore as Christians all have an equal right to study the Scriptures and apply them as the only rule of faith and manners And these are the only principles on which the separation of the Church of England from that of Rome is or can be vindicated  When the friends of the Church can make it appear that these sentiments are dangerous to any wellgoverned State and particularly to that of Great Britain I will then acknowledge how inconsistent soever this may be with the principles just laid down that it is high time not only to lay restraint upon the professors of them but totally to proscribe and banish them from the community But if on the contrary they are essential to the wellbeing of every State to lay the smallest restraint on them is really a  grievance  and indeed a  common evil  since it operates as a discouragement to the only foundations of good government and true religion and ought therefore on every principle on which these depend to be absolutely and totally abrogated  That it is no valid objection to these TESTS that they call in the  sanctions of religion to purposes merely civil  To secure allegiance to lawful government certainty to the payment of its taxes and tributes and veracity to legal testimony in its courts of judicature are  purposes merely civil  and yet they are ALL required and enforced under the  religious sanction of an oath  IV It is certainly a completely valid objection that these religious tests are made subservient to  civil purposes  For this supposes a right in the magistrate to interfere in the regulation of the opinions on which these tests are founded the contrary to which was proved under the st Article And the argument which is drawn in favour of them from the religious nature of an  oath  the application of which to civil purposes is admitted on all hands is an argument drawn from what is totally  dissimilar  and inapplicable to the tests in question For from the sanction of  an oath the utmost which can be argued is that the person who takes it believes the truth of the Christian Religion  In the case of evidence in a court of justice not even this is required but the witnesses are sworn on the principles of  that religion only which they admit  as of divine authority  which does not conclude at all against the  Dissenters  who universally admit the Christian Religionbut the tests with which an oath is here compared imply the belief of a  particular set of principles deduced by men  only from this religion and which being liable to dispute cannot have an authority  equal  to that of the Gospel itself The admission indeed of the sanction of the former as it implies divine authority in that from which it is derived by no means  infers  indeed it  rejects  the sanction of the latter which is founded on human authority only And it may be justly inquired why when an oath is completely sufficient to secure a due allegiance to civil government any other sanction should be called for And whether one who is capable of breaking through obligations derived from a religion acknowledged by him to be divine will not be likely to break through those which arise from only one  particular system  of that religion many of the principles of which system are at best of very dubious authority  This proceeds on the supposition that the tests themselves are unambiguous declarations of attachment to the Church which imposes them and therefore if the arguments against such tests are complete and conclusive they must be still more so against the  sacramental  test required in the Church of England which is capable of and naturally leads to prevarication and deceit in those who submit to it and has been and is perpetually applied to purposes the most directly contrary to the very design with which it was instituted Before therefore the least plea can be advanced in favour of such a test it lies upon its advocates to shew clearly that the receiving of the Lord's Supper for the purpose of taking up a commission in the army a place in the customs the occupation of an exciseman or indeed any worldly and lucrative employment is  perfectly consistent  with the end for which Christ appointed it which was the religious remembrance of his life sufferings and death  That to insist upon  natural  claims to  civil  offices is to advance a palpable absurdity because no member of any society can have any  civil rights  except such as are conveyed to him by the  laws of that society  V It is a sufficient proof of the absurdity of the fifth resolution that it confounds together two totally contrary ideas and makes that to be the  cause  which is the  effect  and the  effect  to be the  cause Civil rights  instead of being the  consequence  of the laws of society are in reality the  causes  of the lawswhich are expressly appointed for their  protection  They are therefore  antecedent  in their very nature to these laws The enjoyment and peaceable possession of civil rights is indeed  secured  by the laws but the rights themselves stand upon the original foundation of nature and to talk of rights being  conveyed  by the laws is not only to make the laws the  creators  of these rights but to take it also for granted that the laws of  every community as laws  must be universally founded on justicethe absurdity of which is evident not only from the applications which are made for the repeal of laws deemed oppressive but from the very acknowledgment that there are governments existing which are supported by  just  laws  If therefore there are civil rights antecedent to law there must be  natural claims to civil offices  for the latter is included in the former Every member of a community has a natural claim to a share in the direction of the affairs of that community otherwise he is supposed to surrender all at least some of his dearest rights on entering into it As it is impossible to suppose this the justice of his claim is in this case plainly established and consequently which is indeed the  same thing  his natural right to civil offices is equally established  I cannot however dismiss this article without expressing my utter astonishment at a declaration of this sort That men have from nature  no civil rights  but that th  se depend merely on the laws and regulations which are made by Government is a principle which tends so directly to the establishment of the most exorbitant  tyranny  on the side of the Governors and the most abject and  Slavish passive obedience  on that of subjects as cannot be thought of without abhorrence and detestation  That as the Dissenters do not suffer or even alledge that they suffer any restraints on their  religious liberties  it is evident that their present design which indeed some of their le  ders openly avow  is a contest for the possession of the civil offices of the state  But we conceive that those offices are to be considered only as TRUSTS  for the benefit of the state  and therefore that they ought not to be confided to those who testify their  disaffection to the state  by their  aversion to its establishments  VI This resolution consists so much of palpable misrepresentation that it scarcely deserves any thing better than a plain and positive denial  That the diffenters do not suffer or even alledge they suffer any restraint on their religious liberties  is with respect to the latter part of the assertion particularly so glaringly false as even their present efforts for the repeal of acts which they account oppressive on their religious liberties are of themselves sufficient to shew Will the author of these resolutions deny this and say that civil restraints merely on account of religious sentiments are no restraints on religious liberty Is there any essential difference between laying a man under fines and penalties on this account and preventing him from obtaining the natural right of citizens If the former is  all must allow persecution in a  high  degree is not the other persecution in a degree somewhat  lower  In some respects it may not be in a  lower  degree For restraint from civil offices may to those men who are peculiarly fitted for doing honour to them be a means of preventing them from reaping the highest emoluments and advantages during their whole lives whereas a fine is temporary and may have an influence only for a moment  In this view therefore the Dissenters instead of contending for power are really contending for the proper rights of human nature and their efforts reflect honour upon themselves and have a tendency and it is to be hoped will have an  efficacy  to produce the general liberty and happiness of the Society to which they belong  But this is not the only restraint they suffer on their religious liberties Though as men and Christians they have a right to vindicate their religious principles and as Dissenters they cannot in vindicating them avoid reflecting on those tenets which differ from theirs yet this very circumstance may be construed into a reviling and derogation of the Liturgy in which case they are liable to the penalty of fines and perpetual imprisonment This is an oppression on  all  Dissenters without exceptionand in the case of those among them who cannot admit the doctrine of the Trinity which is indeed a stumblingblock to many of the best and wisest among the Episcopalians themselves the punishment is no less than  a total loss of legal rights  and  three years imprisonment  without bail It is happy for Dissenters that heresy is left undefined in the English law else the punishment of this which is the same with that which is annexed to the denial of the Trinity would have hung like a dreadful  over the heads of innocent Nonconformists  Let the Chester Clergy after finding these to be facts say if they can that the Diffenters  suffer no restraint on their religious liberties  If this state of the case be just and no one can deny it would it not have been better and indeed more consistent with truth to have ascribed the present  contest  as it is called of the Dissenters to a reasonable and laudable principle of recovering their natural rights rather than to have stigmatized it by the appellation of  a contest for the possession of the offices of the State  A contest it is if you please to use that name and a contest for  power  in  one  sense But it is a contest like that at the Reformation or at the Revolution for the noblest privileges of humanity a contest which whether successful or not will enroll their names among the glorious defenders of civil and religious liberty and make them shine with the brightest splendour to ages yet unborn  I would not be improperly warm even on the subject of religious liberty I shall therefore quit this topic with only proposing to the Chester Clergy these queries  Is a contest for civil offices unlawful in itself Is a contest for civil rights unlawful in itself Do not civil rights imply a right to civil offices  And if this contest is not in itself unlawful I call upon them to tell the world in the most plain and unambiguous manner  what is there in the principles the conduct or the character of the Protestant Dissenters which does not render them in every respect capable of being employed in the executive  as they are already in the most important branch the legislative  department of a good and wellregulated Government  After this there is scarcely any necessity to remark on the next passage  Civil offices are trusts for the benefit of the State  So say the Dissenters too and I will add as to all those who conduct themselves agreeably to the dissenting principles so  act  they also They therefore are among the best if not actually the best subjects in this free and wellgoverned State and as such have a corresponding right to its emoluments and offices As therefore I agree perfectly with the Chester Clergy  that these emoluments and offices ought not to be entrusted to those who testify their disaffection to the State  the conclusion I draw is that the Dissenters not only on account of their natural rights as men but also on account both of their princiciples and conduct as citizens have an equal right with all the other members of the State to a proportional share in its offices emoluments and honours  In the last clause of this resolution  aversion to the establishments of the State  is mentioned as a reason for excluding Dissenters from civil offices What is the meaning of this word Establishments Is it  established laws  If so an aversion to some of them is by no means a reason for excluding Dissenters  only  but  all  who wish for and endeavour after the abrogation of oppressive statutes are unfit for offices But this idea is too absurd to be dwelt upon Is it the establishment of the Church of England In truth Dissenters give themselves little trouble about it Provided they can secure those just rights of a civil and religious nature which have been already stated they willingly leave the honours and emoluments of the Church to remain as they are  That although we hold sacred the rights of private conscience and regard with christian charity those who through its dictates  mistakenly  as we believe reject the terms of our communion yet we consider that very plea of conscience as an insuperable objection to their admission into the  civil offices of the state  For where the separation of any Christians from the established communion is made  because the terms of that communion are held to be sinful  such separatists would not be justifiable on any consistent principles if they did not exert all the power and authority which the possession of civil offices might confer in order to substitute  their  tenets and terms of communion in the place of those of the establishment  in which however they could not succeed but by the destr  ction of our present constitution in church and state  VII This resolution is certainly a most curious one  In proportion to the sincerity of dissenters  is the danger of the Church  It would be a sufficient reply to say  In proportion to the sincerity of the members of the Church of England is the danger of dissenters  As both these propositions are  equally  true for  neither  of them is so let me suggest the following antidote to the poison which is apprehended to the church from the part of the dissenters Let the church shew the truth of its principles let it confute the pretensions of the dissenters let its teachers in life in conversation in preaching and in doctrine surpass those of the Sectarists and I will engage that the Church will never be in danger as to its honours or emoluments But if this either cannot or will not be done I can only say that I believe there is not even one religious Episcopalian but will join with me in wishing well to that profession in which the interests of religion are best supported and in endeavouring after a complete reformation of those things in which they happen to be wilfully and criminally neglected  That for these reasons and considerations as it is our earnest desire on the one hand that they who dissent from the established worship should enjoy a COMPLEAT TOLERATION  in the offices of religion  so it is equally our wish on the other hand that they may be  excluded from the civil offices of the state  it being our humble yet firm and decided opinion that as a  good  government cannot  give them too much case  so a  wise  government cannot  trust them with too little power  VIII For these reasons and considerations may the dissenters say as we are always ready to return our grateful thanks to those who wish us well so we do it sincerely and heartily to our Brethren the Chester Clergy who though they do not appear to us to entertain sufficiently enlarged ideas of Christian liberty  yet express an earnest desire that we should enjoy a complete toleration in the offices of religion  At the same time we beg them to consider the foregoing arguments before they draw the hasty conclusion that on account of our loyalty our sincerity and our love of liberty  we should be excluded from the civil offices of the state  for it is our firm and decided opinion that a wise and good government  cannot grant us too much liberty And we call in this public manner upon those who have stood forth as our enemies to prove what we are persuaded they falsely assert that we cannot be trusted with too  LITTLE POWER
