 FUGITIVE POETICAL PIECES BY MR JERNINGHAM  LONDON PRINTED BY SCOTT FOR J ROBSON BOOKSELLER NEW BOND STREET  MDCCLXXVIII  MARGARET OF ANJOU AN HISTORICAL INTERLUDE  ADVERTISEMENT  THIS historical Interlude is form'd upon the same plan that ROUSSEAU composed his  Pygmalion  which is a new species of dramatic Entertainment consisting of a Monologue that is often suspended by the interposition of Music which must sympathise with the passions and feelings of the personage who is supposed to speak  The following little drama was perform'd by Miss YOUNGE on her benefit night and received from that celebrated actress all the spirit and colouring that excellence of acting can give The  music the composition of Mr HOOK was happily adapted to the tendency of the poem  The subject is taken from a remakable incident in the life of MARGARET That unfortunate QUEEN flying with her Son  into a forest after the Battle of  Hexbam  saw a robber approach with his naked sword and finding that she had no means of escape she suddenly embrac'd the resolution of trusting entirely for protection to his generosity The man whose humanity and generous spirit had been obscured not entirely lost by his vicious course of life was struck with the singularity of the event and charmed with  the confidence reposed in him and he vow'd not only to abstain from all injury against the Queen but to devote himself intirely to her safety and protection  HUME CHAP xxii  N B The Astericks mark the pauses that admitted the music  MARGARET OF ANJOU AN INTERLUDE  Enter  MARGARET  with her Son  THE fierce pursuers will not here perchance  Discover us the thickinwoven umbrage  Of these gigantic trees will spread concealment  Yet as their solemn branches wave strange fear  Possesses me yet all is still as night  No thund'ring tread of horsemen arm'd no quick  Approaching footsteps rush upon my ear  The shourts of rebel victory are lost  And fade away ere they can pierce these shades  Ah what a victory He whose meek sway  Solicited his people's grateful love  My Henry England's monarch fail'd and at  The dying groan of stern defeat that panted  Still for conquest he too sure expired  While I a wretched outcast of the throne  Rove desolate amid these savage walks  Of ev'ry comfort ev'ry hope bereft  To her Child  But thou my Edward still art mine ah lay  Thy weary limbs on yonder bank and I  Will watch beside thee  Leads him to a Bank  He sleeps unconscious of the dire distress  That hovers o'er his head kind Ignorance  That drops her veil before his infant eyes  Yet as he blossoms into youth the hand  Of Time withdrawing back the veil shall for  The radiant prospect he this morn was heir to  Shall offer to his view a throne o'erturn'd  And floating in the blood of all his friends  Ah what a sight it urges me to madness  Yet all that courage cou'd effect was done  When wild Dissension her torn banners rear'd  Which insolently wav'd o'er Henry's head  While he beneath their shade a captive stood  I feeble agent hurried to the field  And at that moment losing all the fears  That haunt the female breast I call'd to loyalty  To snatch my Henry from Rebellion's arm  The valiant troops who then encircled me  On Wakefield's day perform'd their duty well  And on St Alban's memorable plain  I saw defeated Warwick wing his flight  And rescued Henry hasten to these arms  Yet what avail these momentary triumphs  Ev'n while I speak perchance my Henry lies  Extended on the plain deform'd with wounds  While o'er his sacred corse the hostile band  Irreverently pass and with vile taunts  Upbraid his overthrow nor was I present  To solace his last moments catch the accents  Of his departing voice and close his fading eyes  Th' illustrious youth on whose bright armour gleam'd  The morning sun of all that valiant train  Not one remains to guard you helpless innocent  Darkness spreads cold descending nightair chills  My bosom while a murm'ring noise that tells  The coming storm sounds thro' the conscious branches  Of this wood Ah where shall I betake me  Walking in a distracted manner  If at some hamletdoor I knock will not  These robes betray me and the sum that's set  Upon that Infant's head ah will it not  Invite the simple cottager to treachery  Yet here to brave the stern inclement sky  With all the horrors of descending night  My trembling heart refusesI will lead  Him hence vain thought Ah to what stranger heart  Dare I confide my son Shou'd he be torn  From these weak arms yes well too well I know  This anxious heart wou'd at that moment burst  The Pow'r above who sees into the depth  Of my great sorrow knows that not to pride  That not to Exaltation's gaudy honors  I e'er entrusted my felicity  Amid the rude misfortunes that encircled me  The pulse of pleasure throbb'd within my breast  When I embrac'd my son of him bereft  Calamity's sharp fangs will tear my heartstrings  I feel I feel her now fell tygress at  My bosom gorging on my mangled peace  Ye cruel ruffians give me back my son  Ah me wild fear foreruns my loss and joins  The future moment to the present time  Kneeling  Oh thou all seeing Providence if e'er  The scenes on earth attract thy sacred notice  Then let thy knowing clear discerning eye  Whence radiant Pity beams o'er my misfortune  PauseAnd thus humbly as I bend resign'd  Let not my falling ruinous state while it  O'erwhelms the mother crush the child  Rising  The night encreases I must wake my son  Hanging fondly over him  How sleep possesses him Perhaps this slumber  Is doom'd his lastperhapswhat do I see  Stretch'd on a bier methinks I see him gash'd  With daggersAh 'twas fancy bodied forth  This cruel image still my Edward breathes  And these fond arms embrace my living child  PRINCE  Oh mother lead me hence  MARGARET  Say whither shall  I lead my Edward  PRINCE  Lead me to my Father  Why do you weep Ah wherefore not reply  Say is my father slain  MARGARET  I know not that  PRINCE  Whence was that noise  MARGARET  It was the chiding gale  Ah no it is the sound of hostile steps  Enter Robber  ROBBER  Who e'er thou art I see thou'rt in distress  I too am well acquainted with misfortune  And greater still than thine for at my door  Pale Famine sits while starving children send  A mournful peal if ought thou hast conceal'd  Within this wood give me the hoarded treasure  MARGARET  Ah here is all my treasure  Pointing to her child  ROBBER  Trisle not  Give me thy treasure or I'll slay thy Child  MARGARET  Arrest that impious arm He is thy Prince  Talk not of want of Misery's scourging hand  Complain no more in me in me behold  Distressful Marg'ret England's vanquish'd Queen  And all the treasure left her from the field  The cruel havock of this morning's fight  Is center'd in this Child  ROBBER  Thanks to my God  I'm not so lost in vice so deepingulph'd  In woe but that my Sovereign's distress  Obliterates my own forgive the bold  Kneeling  The savage mode in which I first accosted thee  And in atonement for my crime accept  Deign to accept what now my duty offers  I'll lead thee thro' some dark and winding pathway  Of this wild forest to a neighb'ring river  Where rides a Bark whose canvass courts the gales  That fly to France where thou unhappy Queen  May'st find a safe retreat from the wild dangers  That surround thee  MARGARET  Rise rise I dare confide  Myself and my lov'd Child to your protection  Lead on amid the horrors of this hour  Rest of a crown a husband ev'ry friend  Amid this mighty ruin Edward lives  And wretched Margaret still shall be a mother  This godlike deed of thine thou gen'rous man  From out the wond'rous story of this day  Shall shine to latest time the most illustrious  THE END  FOR THE VASE AT BATH EASTON UPON DREAMS  NOVEMBER  I  AS Echo's voice returns the pleasing lay  So is a Dream the Echo of the day  The busy thoughts that round some object teem  Oft join in sleep to form the nightly theme  Then brightey'd Fancy lifts her magic wand  While scenes unreal rise at her command  Then Comedy with all her laughing train  Straight issues from the porch of Comus' fane  And bringing with her all her pleasing wiles  Her pranks her gambols and her winning smiles  She bids her merry troop approach the bed  And beat their airy dance round Anstey's head  II  Still when some chosen fair commands the heart  Gay Fancy acts at night her mimic part  With skillful hand she decks the living scene  And ushers to the view the bosom's Queen  Ye lovers answer to the truth I sing  Say does not Fancy to your stumber bring  Dress'd by each grace in beauty's best array  The welcome fair who charm'd you thro' the day  Does not her form return to glad the sight  Like Cynthia bursting thro' the cloud of night  How pleas'd each wellknown feature we descry  That look of sensethat eloquence of eye  She speaksher words beyond vain Music's art  Steal on our slumber and enchant the heart  III  Sometimes a dream anticipates the date  Comes as a prophet to reveal our fate  And thus ere Yorick sunk into the tomb  The Priest of sentiment foresaw his doom  'Twas nighthis solitary couch he press'd  Till sorrowâ–ªworn he wearied into rest  Eliza then softgliding on his view  Thus o'er his slumber breath'd her sad adieu  'Oh thou my guardian confident and friend  'To what thy handmaid now reveals attend  'No longer now the gift of Health implore  'The curtain drops and thy short scene is o'er  'Yet ere thy feeling spirit takes its flight  'Yet ere I'm robb'd of all my bliss thy sight  Some fond endearment to Eliza shew  'And thy last blessing on thy Child bestow'  The vision ceas'dyet then the shaul she spread  See the Letters to Eliza  To raise compassionate his drooping head  And from her eyes as beads of sorrow fell  Low on her knees receiv'd his last farewell  IV  Oft playful Fancy sheds a brighter beam  And prompts the splendid allegoric dream  Thus late while sleep my closing eyelids seal'd  This visionary scene she then reveal'd  Methought encompass' d by a brilliant train  I reach'd the steps of bright Minerva's fane  Full in the midst a mystic vase I view'd  Round which the Muses newblown flow'rets strew'd  Arm'd with the lyre I saw a youthful band  Who wak'd the sounding chords with skillful hand  Unnumber'd beauties silent stood around  Who grac'd as softer priests the hallow'd ground  There Virtue wore her most attractive mein  And in the form of Marlborough was seen  The Graces skill'd the cultur'd mind to win  Knock'd at the door and Bamfylde let them in  This visionary scene by Fancy bred  Remov'd and thro' the gates of morning fled  I care not that the vision sought the skies  While Miller's dome Minerva's fane supples  Ye Youths ye Fair accept the verse that's due  The splendid Dream is realized in you  ALBINA  WOU'D genius to my fond demand  My earnest bold request bestow  A vivid pencil to this hand  Dipt in the brilliant vernal bow  How eager wou'd I then engage  With faithful and unerring aim  To paint on the poetic page  Albina's elegance of frame  Her tressesdark with auburn hue  Her brow sereneyoung Candour's throne  Her timid eyewhose languid blue  Sheds charms peculiarly its own  Her cheekthat wears a lively glow  Not after the fresh morning show'r  Can Italy's rich summer shew  On all her banks so bright a flow'r  Her cherry lipinviting bliss  Where Love deliciously reposes  Accompanied by many a kiss  On fragrant leaves of breathing roses  Yet who can paint her beauteous mind  There Innocence has fix'd her seat  There easy wit and taste refin'd  And sentiment and knowledge meet  Love who oft whelms the fair in woe  Soon robb'd her guiless mind of rest  Affection's flame dissolved the snow  That lodg'd within her spotless breast  As still the East the mornbeams streak  And gild the portal of the Day  So did her morning thought still break  On the same Youth with Ardor's ray  As the last glimm'rings of the sky  Pause on the lake ere they expire  Each night her thought as clos'd her eye  Died on the Youth of her desire  The nuptials eager to profane  The bold unfeeling treach'rous Youth  Led the chaste Maiden to the fane  With all the mockery of truth  There a domestic in disguise  The office of a priest supplied  While the deceiver led by Vice  Religion's dread reproach defied  Hypocrisy with downcast air  Profaness with an atheist eye  And lust with a malignant leer  Remark'd the mockconnubial tie  No sooner had the youth prevail'd  Successful in his impious aim  He left the drooping fair assail'd  By Grief by Infamy and Shame  'Twas then the beauteous mourner woo'd  Meek Quiet in her lonely seat  Where Competency watchful strew'd  Her sober treasures at her feet  I'll not the little pathway tell  That winds to thy sequester'd scene  Where Virtue loves with thee to dwell  Remoteunseeing and unseen  Where Resignation takes her stand  Prompt to perform her friendly part  And gathers with a trembling hand  The Fragments of a Broken Heart  An English Officer in the late war being taken prisoner by the French Indians became the slave of an old Indian chief who treated him with humanity One day the Indian took the Officer up a Hill and address'd him as follows  See the Anecdotes of Literature vol th  THE INDIAN CHIEF  'TWELVE tedious moons hast thou my captive been  'I've taught thee how to build the swift canoe  'To chace the boar prepare the beaver's skin  'To speed the shaft and scalp the shrieking foe  'Say does thy father sleep within his grave'  'Oh Heav'n forbid the feeling youth replied  'Then do his sorrows all my pity crave'  The chief return'd'Tweve better he had died  'I was a father onceoh valiant son  'Thy loss each low'ring morn and eve recall  'To shield my years to danger's path he run  'These eyes beheld the gallant warrior fall  'And glory saw him fall with wounds o'erspread'  'Bold on his bosom ev'ry wound he bore  'I rent the forelock from his murderer's head  'And left him breathless on the crimson shore  'Since that sad day my hours no pleasure share'  The Indian chief now paus'd with sorrow fraught  Wrapt in the awful silence of despair  At length in words he cloath'd his mournful thought  'Behold that sun how bright it shines to you  'Since that sad day to me it looks a cloud  'How gay you blooming roses meet your view  'To me grief drops o'er Nature's breast a shroud  'Go virtuous stranger to thy father go  'Wipe from his furrow'd cheek Misfortune's tear  'Go bid the sun to him his splendor shew  'And bid the flow'r in all her bloom appear'  ON SEEING Mrs MONTAGU's PICTURE  HAD this fair form the mimic art displays  Adorn'd in Roman time the brightest days  In ev'ry dome in ev'ry sacred place  Her statue wou'd have breath'd an added grace  Andon its basis would have been enroll'd  This is Minerva cast in Virtue's mould  INSCRIPTION FOR A REEDHOUSE  At  Cossey  the Seat of Sir WILLIAM JERNINGHAN  Say if to shun the noisy day  The summer sun's oppressive ray  Thou visit'st Contemplation's cell  Here tarryshe'll repay thee well  For she can bid each passion cease  And soothe the troubled heart to peace  Can to thy sober wishes yield  Contentment's flow'r and Wisdom's shield  THE VENETIAN MARRIAGE  THE western sun's expiring ray  To VENICE gave a milder day  Till by degrees the ling'ring light  Hung trembling on the verge of night  CAMILLA then with fearful soul  To th' Adriatic margin stole  Where in a bark at Love's command  PLACENTIO took his faithful stand  Possessing now his future bride  He bade the bark securely glide  Which far unlike that gally show'd  That down the silver Cydnus row'd  Beneath whose purple sails were seen  Proud Ostentiation's gaudy Queen  Who sure of conquest vain of mind  All languishingly lay reclined  Here Beauty undefil'd by art  Whose bosom own'd a tender heart  Beneath the sails from home remov'd  And trusted to the man she lov'd  A soothing calmness lull'd the deep  And hush'd each wavy surge to sleep  The air along the sultry day  Scorch'd by the summer's fervent ray  Was freshen'd by a recent show'r  While Silence solemniz'd the hour  The still solemnity impress'd  With awful thoughts CAMILLA'S breast  For now by prompting Love impell'd  Now by Timidity witheld  The words which to pronounce she tried  Recoil'd and unaccented died  PLACENTO too alike subdued  They sail'd along in silent mood  And stillness reign'd from shore to shore  Unbrokebut by the dashing oar  At length the fair dissolv'd the charm  'Ah wonder not I feel alarm  'Confiding in thy love I came  'And risk'd for thee my virgin fame  'Ah tell me to what place we sail  'For in my bosom fears prevail  'Yet answer not this idle fear  'Where'er thou art bright Honour's there'  'The plan I form the youth replied  'To Innocence is close allied  'And fearful of thy virgin fame  'As of her babe the tender dame  'These waves that wander to the sea  'Wash in their pilgrimage a tree  'Which spreads its lowly branches wide  'And dips them in the passing tide  'There in a shed compos'd of reeds  'An aged hermit tells his beads  'He gen'rous sage will join our hands  'In wedlock's unremitting bands  'Then to VALCLUSA we'll repair  'Where LAURA's soul informs the air  'Where PETRARCH's spirit hovers round  'The guardian of the sacred ground  Forbidding still that fiend of art  'That shrewd perverter of the heart  'The snake Inconstancy to rove  'Within the paradise of Love  'As when chill Winter quits the land  'The snowdrop does her leaves expand  'So may chill fears your breast release  'Till gently it expands to peace  'Mild as these twilight breezes blow  'Soft as the waves on which we flow'  'Ye walls where first I drew the air  'Return'd assur'd the beauteous fair  'Ye turrets which but dimly seen  'Encrease the terrour of the scene  'Ye stately tow'rs and rising spires  'From you CAMILLA now retires  'Thou tomb whose pious urn contains  'My sacred parents' cold remains  'Ye partners of my tender years  'Whom youthful sympathy endears  'Ye joys that crown my native coast  'Well for PLACENTIO all are lost  She ceas'dand on her pensive soul  Agian an awful musing stole  Such as the twilight scene excites  Such as the feeling heart delights  For as the coy nocturnal flow'r  The nightsmelling Geranium  No more its sweets at eve witholds  So the meek heart at th' evening hour  Its sensibility unfolds  See now they reach the sacred cell  Where Wisdom Peace and Virtue dwell  There bent beneath the weight of age  They find prepar'd th' expecting sage  He hail'd them in a friendly tone  And bade them call his cell their own  Where rose an altar form'd of moss  Crown'd with a simple wooden cross  There too a taper mildly bright  Supplied a pompous glare of light  No holy relick richenchas'd  This humble lowroof'd temple grac'd  But flow'rets from the neighb'ring wood  The unambitious altar strew'd  For incense they exhal'd perfume  For ornament they gave their bloom  The hermit spoke'Hail virtuous pair  May sorrow now your bosom spare  'Tho' youth be yours yet well I know  'You've tasted deep of human woe  'Control and art and baseness join'd  'To cancel what your hearts design'd  'But now Misfortune's reign is o'er  'And Pleasure opens all her store'  See now the youthful pair unite  To meet the hymeneal rite  Pronouncing as they lowly bow  Warm from the heart the hallow'd vow  At length the hermit joins their hands  In willing and unvenal bands  Unspotted bands which mutual Love  And Confidence and Virtue wove  THE MEXICAN FRIENDS  The sublime instance of heroic friendship that forms the subject of this poem is recorded by ANTONIO DE SOLIS in his History of the conquest of Mexico This is an Episode of a more extensive poem and being the part that was the most favourably receiv'd I am not unwilling to sacrisice a few pages for the sake of rendering my poetical offerings more acceptable to the public  SEE to the fane HISPANIA'S troops repair  Whose high ascending tow'rs are lost in air  From whence the MEXICANS with speedy art  Show'r on the foe the deathinflicting dart  Yet then by CORTEZ led still undismay'd  The SPANIARD host the losty fane invade  Two valiant youths whom friendship's holy hand  Had join'd with her indissoluble band  Beheld indignant smit with patriot grief  The great achievements of the hostile chief  And now JANELLAN thus accosts his friend  'Firm to no purpose active to no end  'See from our gallant men you hallow'd tow'r  'Already ravish'd by th' invading pow'r  'Must this committed to our mutual care  'The same defeat the same dishonour share  'If sothe victor shall not long survive  'A thought that bids my fading hope revive  'A thoughtthat like the thunderflash of night  'Darts on my darken'd mind a radiant light  'But ere my veil'd designment I unfold  'Declare however rash however bold  'Thou'lt not o'ershade with Caution's chill controul  'The warm the splendid purpose of my soul'  VENZULA to his breast his hand applied  And thus beyond the pow'r of words replied  The youth resum'd'From this aerial height  'Bid thy bold vision take its deepest flight  'Down to you rock far stretching o'er the shore  'Gainst which the raging waves incessant roar  'Whose clashing voices into stillness fade  'Ere this tremendous distance they pervade  'If Fortune bless what my proud counsels urge  'Yon waves shall murmur soon the victor's dirge  'My secret project I will now unveil  'Should CORTEZ o'er this valiant band prevail  'Should thro' controulment and thro' stubborn force  'Pour like a torrent his destructive course  'When on this summit first he shall appear  'I will advance with welldissembled fear  'And suppliant as I kneel to win his grace  'I'll dauntless lock him in a stern embrace  'Bear him reluctant to you giddy steep  'Where yawns a dreadful opening to the deep  'And thenceselfruin'd for my country's good  'Plunge with her foe into the whelming flood'  VENZULA answered'Yes I much admire  'What now thy matchless virtue dares inspire  'But wilt thou with an avarice of fame  'The meed of Glory all exclusive claim  'Wilt thou to perils close to Death adjoin'd  'Advance and leave thy fathful Friend behind  'In infancy we shar'd the glitt'ring toys  'And in one circle play'd our harmless joys  'And when we quitted childhood's lowly vale  'Where springing flow'rets scent the playful gale  'Still hand in hand we climb'd youth's arduous height  'Whence greater scences expanded on the sight  'Still our pursuits consenting to one plan  'Like wedded streams our lives united ran  'And wilt thou now oppose the sacred tide  'And bid the friendly waves disparting glide'  JANELLAN spoke'Endearing youth forgive  'The conq'ror of some future CORTEZ live  'Nor mark my fall with Grief's dejected brow  'View from my death the bright effects that flow  'Behold the tomb that Gratitude shall raise  'Illustrious signal of my country's praise'  To this the brave VENZULA made reply  And as he spoke tears started from his eye  'What tho' Felicity thy gift shall stream  'Sunlike o'er MEXICO with brighrest beam  'Not all the splendour that her rays impart  'Will e'er illumine my benighted heart  'When destitute of thee its only ray  'Without the hope of kind returning day  'Yet then to this great argument adjoin'd  'Sublimer motives urge my steady mind  'Recall recall that joydiffusing hour  'When gay Prosperity adorn'd my bow'r  'As thy fair sister halfafraid to speak  'With downcast look and blushembellish'd cheek  'At Love's request affented to be mine  'Of fleeting bliss vain momentary shine  'For she in flow'r of Youth and Virtue's bloom  'Was swept untimely to the rav'nous tomb  'As sorrowwounded o'er her couch I hung  'To catch the tones that faded as they sprung  'The God  she said  now summons me away  'Far from the confines of th' endearing day  'Thou of the life I lose the dearest part  'Thou chosen spouse thou sunbeam of my heart  'Say by Affection's glowing hand impress'd  'Shall I not live in thy recording breast  'If sacred be the suff'rer's last desires  'Revere what now my parting soul requires  'I leave a brother by bright Honour rear'd  'By all approv'd and much to me endear'd  'Be for the sister's love the brother's friend  'Nor from his side depart when storms descend  'The palm of Glory waving in your sight  'In council peril enterprise unite'  'Shall I when danger calls consign to air  'The last bequeathing wishes of the fair  'Perdition catch the base unmanly thought  'By Love's subliming purest dictates taught  'Amid the perils that around thee wait  'View me resolv'd to share th' impending fate  'Now to this spot the foe impels the war  'Discordance screams opposing lances jar  'The steep ascent lo CORTEZ now has gain'd  'Ah mark his spear with streaming gore distain'd'  Th' illustrious youths now act their dread design  See at the victor's knee they low incline  Now clasp with circling force th' incautious foe  And close adhering to his figure grow  Their deadly aim his better fate controll'd  With matchless pow'r he bursts their stubborn hold  The heroes blasted in their bold intent  Approach'd Death hov'ring near the dire descent  Then in each other's circling arms compress'd  The last and dear farewell in sighs express'd  'Twas Friendship burning with meridian flame  On causeone thoughtone ruinand one fame  Tremendous moment See they fall from light  And dauntless rush to never ending night  Ye selfdevoted patriot victims hail  Oblivion's gulph shall ne'er entomb your tale  While History to Time's extremest goal  Her stream majestic shall thro' ages roll  Like two fair flow'rets on one stem that blow  Ye on her margin shall for ever glow  FINIS
