 THOUGHTS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MANNERS OF THE GREAT TO GENERAL SOCIETY  YOU ARE THE MAKERS OF MANNERS  SHAKESPEARE  SECOND EDITION WITH ADDITIONS  LONDON PRINTED FOR T CADELL IN THE STRAND MDCCLXXXVIII  THOUGHTS ON THE MANNERS OF THE GREAT  TO a large and honourable class of the community to persons considerable in reputation important by their condition in life and commendable for the decency of their general conduct these slight hints are respectfully addressed They are not intended as a satire upon  vice or a ridicule upon folly being written neither for the foolish nor the vicious The subject is too serious for ridicule and those to whom it is addressed are too respectable for satire It is recommended to the consideration of those who filling the higher ranks in life are naturally regarded as patterns by which the manners of the rest of the world are to be fashioned  The mass of mankind in most places and in most conditions of life is perhaps chiefly composed of what may be termed  good kind of  people  for persons of very flagitious wickedness are almost as rare as those of very eminent piety to the latter of these admonition were impertinent to the former it were superfluous These remarks therefore are principally written with a view to those persons of rank and fortune who live within the restraints of moral obligation and acknowledge the truth of the Christian religion and who if in certain instances they allow themselves in practices not compatible with a strict prosession of Christianity seem to do it rather from habit and want of reflection  than either from disbelief of its doctrines or contempt of its precepts  Inconsideration Fashion and the World are three consederates against Virtue with whom even good kind of people often contrive to live on excellent terms and the fair reputation which may be obtained by a complaisant conformity to the prevailing practice and by mere decorum of manners without a strict attention to religious principle is a constant source of danger to the rich and great There is something almost  irresistibly seducing in the contagion of general example hence the necessity of that vigilance which it is the business of Christianity to quicken by incessant admonition and of the world to lay asleep by the perpetual opiates of ease and pleasure  A fair reputation is one of the most laudable objects of human ambition yet even this really valuable blessing is sometimes converted into a snare by inducing a treacherous security as soon as it is obtained A fatal indolence is apt to creep in  upon the soul when it has once acquired the good opinion of mankind if the acquisition of that good opinion was the ultimate end of its endeavours Pursuit is at an end when the object is in possession for he is not likely to "press forward" who thinks he has already  attained  The love of worldly reputation and the desire of God's favour have this specific difference that in the latter the possession always augments the desire and the spiritual mind accounts nothing done while any thing remains undone  But after all a fair fame and the support of numbers is obviously a deceitful dependence for as every individual must die for himself and answer for himself both these imaginary resources will fail just at the moment when they could have been of any use A good reputation even without internal piety would be worth obtaining if the tribunal of heaven were fashioned after the manner of human courts of judicature If at the general judgment we were to be tried by a jury of our fellow mortals it would be but common prudence to secure  their favour at any price But it can now stand us in little stead in the great day of decision as it is the consummation of infinite goodness not to abandon us to the mercy of each other's sentence but to reserve us for  his  final judgment who knows every motive of every action who will make strict inquisition into sincerity of heart and uprightness of intention in whose eyes an ineffectual prayer or a powerless wish will outweigh the most splendid profession or the most dazzling action  We cannot but rejoice in every  degree of human virtue which operates favourably on society whatever be the motive or whoever be the actor and we should gladly commend every degree of goodness though it be not squared by our own rules and notions Even the good actions of such persons as are too much actuated by a regard to appearances are not without their beneficial effects The righteousness of those who occupy this middle region of morality certainly exceeds the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees for they are not only exact in ceremonials but in many  respects fulfil the weightier matters of law and conscience Like Herod they often  hear gladly and do many things  Yet I am afraid I shall be thought fevere in remarking that in general those characters in the New Testament of whose future condition no very comfortable hope is given seem to have been taken not from the profligate the abandoned and the dishonourable but from that decent class commonly described by the term of  good sort of people  that mixed kind of character in which virtue appears if it does not predominate The young Ruler  was certainly one of the first of this order and yet we are left in dark uncertainty as to his final allotment The rich man who built him barns and storehouses and only proposed to himself the full enjoyment of that fortune which perhaps he had very fairly obtained might have been for all that appears to the contrary a very good sort of man at least if we may judge of him by multitudes who live precisely for the same purposes and yet enjoy a good degree of credit and are rather considered as objects of admiration than of censure  But the most alarming instance is he who was clothed in purple and fine linen fared sumptuously every day and gave nothing to Lazarus and who is represented after death as lifting up his eyes being in torments He committed no enormities that have been transmitted to us for that he dined well dressed well and refused to relieve one beggar could hardly incur the bitter penalty of eternal misery His punishment seems to have been the consequence of a hard worldly selfish heart spoilt by the softnesses and delights of life There is no  error more common or more dangerous than that an unrestrained indulgence of appetite is generally attended with a liberal humane and merciful temper Nor is there any opinion more false and more fatal or which demands to be more steadily controverted than that libertinism and goodnature are natural and necessary associates For after all that corrupt poets and more corrupt philosophers have told us of the blandishments of pleasure and of its tendency to soften the temper and humanize the affections it is certain that nothing hardens the  heart like excessive and unbounded luxury and he who refuses the fewest gratifications to his own voluptuousness will generally be found the least susceptible of tenderness for the wants of others The cruelties at Rome bore an exact proportion to the dissoluteness at Capreae And it is not less notorious that the Imperial fidler became more barbarous as he grew more profligate Prosperity says the Arabian proverb fills the heart till it makes it hard and the most dangerous pits and snares for human virtue are those which are so covered over  with the flowers of prosperous fortune that it requires a cautious foot and a vigilant eye to escape them  Even Ananias and Saphira were I doubt not well esteemed in society for it was enough to establish a very considerable reputation to sell even part of their possessions for religious purposes but what an alarm does it sound to hypocrisy that instead of being rewarded for what they brought they were punished for what they kept back And it is to be feared that this deceitful pair are not the only one  upon whom a good action without a pure intention has drawn down a righteous retribution  For though outward actions are the surest and to human eyes the only evidences of sincerity yet Christianity is a religion of  motives  and  principles  The Gospel is continually referring to the  heart  as the source of good it is to the poor in  spirit  to the pure in  heart  that the divine blessing is annexed A man may correct many improper practices and refrain from many immoral actions from merely human  motives but though this partial amendment is not without its uses yet this is only attacking symptoms and neglecting the mortal disease But to subdue a worldly temper to control irregular desires and to have a clean heart is to extinguish the soul and spirit and essence of sin Totally to  accomplish  this is perhaps beyond the narrow limits of human perfection but to  attempt  it with an humble reliance on superior aid is so far from being an extravagant or romantic flight of virtue that it is but the common duty of every ordinary Christian And this  perfection is not the less real because it is a point which seems constantly to recede from our approaches Our highest attainments instead of bringing us "to the mark" only teach us to remove the mark to a greater distance by giving us more humbling views of ourselves and more exalted conceptions of the state which we are labouring after Though the progress towards perfection may be perpetual in this world the actual attainment is reserved for a better And this restless desire of a happiness which we cannot reach and this lively idea of a perfection  which we cannot attain are among the many arguments for a future state which seem to come little short of absolute demonstration  But I must remember that this is not a sermon but a mere superficial essay I am neither an old man a clergyman nor a methodist so that it is at least  possible  that I may be neither actuated by moroseness selfinterest nor enthusiasm I live much in the world and have as much satisfaction in its lawful pleasures and permitted indulgencies as other men I endeavour to cultivate  the greatest candour for the opinions and affection for the persons of all my fellow creatures I am charmed with the humanity generosity and integrity even of worldly men But one virtue must not intrench upon other Charity must not supplant faith If a man be generous good natured and humane it is impossible not to feel for him the tenderness of a brother but if at the same time he be irreligious intemperate or profane who shall dare to say he is in a safe state Good humour and generous sentiments will always make a man  a pleasant acquaintance but who shall lower the doctrines of the Gospel to accommodate them to the conduct of men Who shall bend a strait rule to favour a crooked practice Who shall controvert that authority which has said that  without holiness no man shall see the Lord  May I venture to be a little paradoxical and while so many grave persons are descanting on the mischiefs of vice may I be permitted to say a word on the mischiefs of virtue or rather of that shining counterfeit which while it wants  the specific gravity has much of the brightness of sterling worth Never perhaps did any age produce more beautiful declamations in praise of virtue than the present never were more polished periods rounded in honour of humanity An ancient Pagan would imagine that Astrea had returned to take up her abode in our metropolis a primitive Christian would conclude that  righteousness and peace had there met together  But how would they be surprised to find that the obligation to these duties was not always thought binding on their eloquent  encomiasts that universal benevolence may subsist with partial injustice and boundless liberality with sordid selfishness that one may seem eager in redressing the injuries of half the globe without descending to the petty detail of private virtues and burn with zeal for the good of millions one never saw and yet spread vice and ruin through the little circle of one's own personal influence  When the general texture of an irregular life is spangled over with some constitutional pleasing  qualities when gaiety good humour and a thoughtless profusion of expence throw a lustre round the faultiest characters it is no wonder that common observers are blinded into admiration a profuse generosity dazzles them more than all the duties of the decalogue But though it may be a very useful quality towards securing the election of a borough it will contribute but little towards making sure the calling and election to the kingdom of heaven It is somewhat strange that extravagance should be the great criterion of goodness with those  very people who are themselves the victims to this idol for the prodigal pays no debts if he can help it and it is notorious that in one of the wittiest and most popular comedies which this country has ever produced those very passages which exalt liberality at the expence of justice were nightly applauded with enthusiastic rapture by those deluded tradesmen whom perhaps that very sentiment helped to keep out of their money  But there is another sort of fashionable character whose false brightness  is still more pernicious by casting a splendour over the most destructive vices Corrupt manners ruinous extravagance and the most fatal passion for play are sometimes gilded over with many engaging acts of charity and a general attention and respect to the ceremonials of Christianity But this is degrading the venerable image and superscription of religion by stamping them on baser metal than they were ever intended to impress The young and gay shelter themselves under such examples and scruple the less to adopt the bad parts of such mixed  characters when they see that an immoral conduct is so compatible with a religious profession  But I digress from my intention for it is not the purpose of this address to take notice of any actions which the common consent of mankind has determined to be wrong but of such chiefly as are practised by the sober the decent and the regular and to drop a few hints on such less obvious offences as are in general  Safe from the bar the pulpit and the throne  Nor will the bounds which I have  prescribed myself allow of my wandering into a wide and general field of observation  The idea of the present slight performance was suggested by reading the King's late excellent proclamation against irreligion and immorality Under the shelter of so high a sanction it may not be unseasonable to press on the hearts of the better disposed such observances as seem to be generally overlooked and to remark such offences as commonly elude censure because they are not commonly thought censurable  It is obvious to all serious persons that that branch of the divine law against which the better kind of people trespass with the least scruple is the fourth commandment Many who would shudder at the violation of the other nine seem without ceremony to expunge this from the divine code but by what authority they do this has never been explained The Christian legislator does not seem to have abridged the commandments and there is no subsequent authority so much as pretended to by Protestants  It is not here intended to take notice of such flagrant offences as lie open to the cognizance of higher tribunals or to pollute this paper with descanting on the holders of card assemblies on Sundays the frequenters of taverns and gaming houses the printers of Sunday newspapers the proprietors of Sunday stage coaches and others who openly insult the laws of the land laws which will always be held sacred by good citizens even were not the law of God antecedent to them  Many of the order whom I here  address are persons of the tenderest humanity and not only wish well to the interests of virtue but are favourably disposed to advance the cause of religion nay would be extremely startled at not being thought sincerely religious yet from inconsideration want of time want of selfexamination want of suspecting the deceitfulness of the human heart sometimes allow themselves in inattentions and negligences which materially affect their own safety and the comfort of othersWhile an animated spirit of charity seems to be kindled among us  while there is a general disposition to instruct the ignorant and to reform the vicious one cannot help regretting that these amiable exertions should be counteracted in some degree by practices of a directly opposite tendency trifling in their appearance but serious in their effects  There are still among us petty domestic evils which seem too inconsiderable to claim redress There is an aggrieved body of men in our very capital whose spiritual hardships seem scarcely to have been  taken into consideration mean the HAIR DRESSERS on whom  The Sunday shines no day of rest to them  Is there not a peculiar degree of unkindness in exercising such cruelty on the souls of men whose whole lives are employed in embellishing our persons And is it quite conceivable how a lady's conscience is able to make such nice distinctions that she would be shocked at the idea of sending for her mantuamaker or milliner her carpenter or mason on a Sunday while she makes no scruple regularly to employ a hairdresser  Is it not almost ridiculous to observe the zeal we have for doing good at a distance while we neglect the little obvious everyday domestic duties which should seem to solicit our immediate attention But an action ever so right and meritorious which is only to be periodically performed at distant intervals is less burthensome to corrupt nature than an undeviating attention to such small constant right habits as are hostile to our natural indolence and would be perpetually vexing and disturbing our selflove The weak heart indulges  its infirmity by allowing itself intermediate omissions and habitual neglects of duty reposing itself for safety on regular but remote returns of stated performances It is less trouble to subscribe to the propagation of the Gospel in foreign parts than to have daily prayers in our own families and I am persuaded that there are multitudes of wellmeaning people who would gladly contribute to a mission of Christianity to Japan or Otaheite to whom it never occurred that the hairdresser whom they are every Sunday detaining from church has  a soul to be saved that the law of the land cooperates with the law of God to forbid their employing him and that they have no right either legal or moral to this portion of his time The poor man himself perhaps dares not remonstrate for fear he should be deprived of his employment for the rest of the week If there were no other objection to a pleasurable Sunday among the great and affluent methinks this single one might operate would not a devout heart be unwilling to rob a fellow creature of his  time for devotion or a humane one of his hour of rest  It is strange that there should be so little consistency in human conduct that the same persons should gladly contribute to spread the light of Christianity in another hemisphere while by their example they actually obstruct the progress of it at home But it is I doubt not much oftener owing to the imperceptible influence of custom and habit than to a decided ill intention Besides it may be in morals as it is in optics the eye and the  object may come too close to each other to answer the end of vision There are certain faults which press too near our selflove to be even perceptible to us  There is an evil newly crept into polished society and it comes under a mask so specious that they are chiefly good sort of people who are allured by it I mean SUNDAY CONCERTS Many who would be startled at a prophane or even an idle amusement think that the name of  sacred music  sanctifies the diversion But if those who live in ease  and affluence do not make these petty renunciations of their own ways and their own pleasure what criterion have we by which to judge of their sincerity For as the goodness of Providence has exempted them from painful occupations they have neither labour from which to rest nor business from which to refrain A little abstinence from pleasure is the only evidence of their obedience to the divine precept  I know with what indignant scorn this remark will by many be received  that much will be advanced in favour of the sanctity of this amusement I shall be told that the words are many of them extracted from the Bible and that the composition is the divine Handel's But were the angel Gabriel the poet the archangel Michael the composer and the song of the Lamb the subject it would not abrogate that statute of the Most High which has said  Thou shalt keep holy the Sabbathday and thy SERVANT and thy CATTLE shall do no manner of work  I am persuaded that the hallelujahs of Heaven would  make no moral music to the ear of a conscientious person while he reflected that multitudes of servants are waiting in the streets exposed to every temptation engaged perhaps in prophane swearing and idle if not dissolute conversation and the very cattle are deprived of that rest which the tender mercy of God was graciously pleased by an astonishing condescension to include in the commandment  But I will for the sake of argument so far concede as to allow of the innocence and even piety of  Sunday concerts I will suppose what however does not always happen that no unhallowed strains are ever introduced that some attend these concerts with a view to cultivate devout affections that they cherish the serious impressions excited by the music and retire in such a frame of spirit as convinces them that the heart was touched while the ear was gratified Nay I  would  grant if such a concession would be accepted that the intervals were filled up with conversation  whereby one may edify another  Yet all these good effects allowing them  really to have been produced will not remove the invincible objection of an EVIL EXAMPLE and what liberal spirit would refuse any reasonable sacrifice of its own pleasure to so important a motive Your servants have been accustomed to consider a concert as a secular diversion if you therefore continue it on a Sunday will not they also expect to be indulged on that day with their common amusements Saint Paul who was a very liberal thinker believed it prudent to make frequent sacrifices of things indifferent in themselves He was willing to deny  himself a harmless and lawful gratification  even as long as the world stood  rather than shock the tender consciences of men of less understanding Where a practice is neither good nor evil in itself it is both discreet and generous to avoid it if it can be attended with any possible danger to minds less enlightened and to faith less confirmed  But religion apart I have sometimes wondered that people do not yield to the temptation that is held out to them of abstaining from diversions one day in seven upon  motives of mere human policy as voluptuaries sometimes fast to give a keener relish to the delights of the next repast For pleasure like an overfed lamp is extinguished by the excess of its own aliment But the lovers of pleasure are not always prudent even upon their own principles for I am persuaded that the world would afford much more real satisfaction than it does if we did not press and torture and strain it to yield what it does not contain Much good and much pleasure it does liberally bestow but no labour or art can extract from it that  elixir of peace that divine essence of content which it is not in its nature to produce There is good sense in searching into every blessing for its  hidden  properties but it is folly to ransack and plunder it for such as the experience of all ages tells us are  foreign  to it We exhaust the world of its pleasures and then lament that it is empty we wring those pleasures to the very dregs and then complain that they are vapid  I shall probably be accused of a very narrow and fanatical spirit in  animadverting on a practice so little suspected of harm as the frequenting of public walks and gardens on a Sunday and certainly there cannot be an amusement more entirely harmless in itself But I must appeal to the honest testimony of our own hearts if the  effect  be favourable to seriousness Do we commonly retire from these places with the impressions which were made on us at church in their full force We entered these sprightly scenes perhaps with a strong remaining tincture of that devout spirit which the public worship had infused into  If the heart be laid open to the incursion of vain imaginations and worldly thoughts it matters little by what gate the enemy entered If the effect be injurious the cause cannot be quite harmless It is the perfidious property of certain pleasures that though they seem not to have the smallest harm in themselves they imperceptibly indispose the mind to every thing that is good  Many readers will be apt to produce against all this preciseness that  hackneyed remark which one is tired of hearing that Sunday diversions are allowed publicly in many foreign countries as well in those professing the reformed religion as popery But the corruptions of one part of the Protestant world are no reasonable justification of the evil practices of another Error and infirmity can never be proper objects of imitation It is still a remnant of the old leaven and as to pleading the practice of Roman Catholic countries one blushes to hear an enlightened Prorestant justifying himself by examples  drawn from that benighted religion  Besides though I am far from vindicating the amusements permitted on Sundays in foreign countries by allowing that established custom and long prescription have the privilege of conferring right yet foreigners may at least plead the sanction of custom and the connivance of the law While in this country the law of the land and established usage concurring with still higher motives give a sort of venerable sanction to religious observances  the breach of which will be always more liable to misconstruction than in countries where so many motives do not concur  I am not an advocate for the severity of a Jewish or the moroseness of a Puritanical sabbath I am likewise far from inferring that all those who neglect a strict observation of Sunday are remiss in the performance of their other duties but I will venture to affirm that all whom I have remarked conscientiously to observe this day from right motives have been uniformly attentive  to their general conduct It has been the opinion of many wise and good men  The testimony of one lawyer will perhaps be less suspected than that of many priests"I have ever found" says the great Lord Chief Justice Hale  by a strict and diligent observation that a due observance of the duty of Sunday has ever had joined to it a blessing upon the rest of my time and the week that has been so begun has been blessed and prosperous to me and on the other side when I have been negligent of the duties of this day the rest of the week has been unsuccessful and unhappy to my own secular employments So that I could easily make an estimate of my successes the week following by the manner of my passing this day AND I DO NOT WRITE THIS LIGHTLY BUT BY LONG AND SOUND EXPERIENCE  Sir Matthew Hale's Works  that Christianity  will stand or fall as this day is neglected or observed Sunday seems to be a kind of Christian Palladium and the city of God will never be totally taken by the enemy till the observance of that be quite lost Every sincere soldier of the great Captain of our Salvation must therefore exert himself in its defence as ever he would preserve  the divine Fort of Revelation against the confederated attacks of the world and the Devil  I shall proceed to enumerate a few of the many causes which seem to impede welldisposed people in the progress of religion None perhaps contributes more to it than that cold prudential caution against the folly of aiming at  perfection  so frequent in the mouths of the worldly wise "We must take the world" say they  as we find it reformation is not the business of individuals and we are commanded  not to be righteous overmuch  But these admonitions are contrary to every maxim in human affairs In arts and letters  When Pliny the younger was accused of despising the degenerate eloquence of his own age and of the vanity of aspiring at perfection in oratory and of endeavouring to become the rival of Cicero instead of denying the charge he exclaimed with a noble spirit STULTISSIMUM credo ad imitandum non OPTIMA quaeque proponere  the most consummate models are held out to imitation We never hear any body cautioned against becoming too wise too learned or too rich Zeal in  business is accounted commendable in friendship it is amiable in all the perishing concerns of earthly things it is extolled as exhibiting marks of a sprightly temper and a vigorous mind Strange that to be "fervent in spirit" should only be dishonourable in that single instance which should seem to demand unremitting diligence and unextinguished warmth  But after all is an excessive and intemperate zeal the  common  vice of the times Is there any  very  imminent danger that the enthusiasm of the great should transport them to dangerous  and inconvenient excesses Are our young men of fashion so  very  much led away by the ardour of piety that they require to have their imaginations cooled by the freezing maxims of worldly wisdom Is the spirit of the age so  very  much inclined to catch and to communicate the fire of devotion as to require to be damped by admonition or extinguished by ridicule When the inimitable Cervantes attacked the wild notions and romantic ideas which misled the age in which he lived he did wisely because he combated an actually existing evil  but in this latter end of the eighteenth century there seems to be little more occasion among persons of rank I mean of cautions against enthusiasm than against chivalry and he who declaims against religious excesses in the company of well bred people shews himself to be as little acquainted with the manners of the times as he would do who should think it a point of duty to write another Don Quixote  Among the devices dangerous to our moral safety certain favourite and specious maxims are not the  least successful as they carry with them an imposing air of indulgent candour and always seem to be on the popular side of good nature One of the most obvious of these is that method of reconciling the conscience to practices not decidedly wicked and yet not scrupulously right by the qualifying phrase  that there is no harm in it  I am mistaken if more innocent persons do not inflame their spiritual reckoning by this treacherous apology than by almost any other means Few are systematically or premeditatedly wicked or propose to themselves  at first more than such small indulgences as they are persuaded  have no harm in them  But this latitude is gradually and imperceptibly enlarged As the expression is vague and indeterminate as the darkest shade of virtue and the lightest shade of vice melt into no very incongruous colouring as the bounds between good and evil are not always so precisely defined but that he who ventures to the confines of the one will find himself on the borders of the other every one furnishes his own definition every one extends the supposed limits a  little farther till the bounds which fence in permitted from unlawful pleasures are gradually broken down and the marks which separated them imperceptibly destroyed  It is perhaps one of the most alarming symptoms of the degeneracy of morals in the present day that the distinctions of right and wrong are almost swept away in polite conversation The most serious offences are often named with cool indifference the most shameful profligacy with affected  tenderness The substitution of the word  gallantry  for that crime which stabs domestic happiness and conjugal virtue is one of the most dangerous of all the modern abuses of language Atrocious deeds should never be called by gentle names This must certainly contribute more than any thing to diminish the horror of vice in the rising generation That our passions should be too often engaged on the side of error we may look for the cause though not for the vindication in the unresisted propensities of our constitution but that our  reason  should ever be employed in its favour that our  conversation  should ever be taught to palliate it that our  judgment  should ever look on it with indifference has no shadow of excuse because this can pretend to no foundation in nature no apology in temptation no palliative in passion  However defective therefore our practice may be however we may be allured by seduction or precipitated by passion let us beware of lowering the STANDARD OF RIGHT This induces an imperceptible corruption  into the heart stagnates the noblest principle of action irrecoverably debases the sense of moral and religious obligation and prevents us from living up to the height of our nature It cuts off all communication with virtue and almost prevents the possibility of a return to it If we do not rise as high as we aim we shall rise the higher for having aimed at a lofty mark but where the RULE is low the practice cannot be high though the converse of the proposition is not proportionably true  Nothing more benumbs the exertions of ardent youthful virtue than the cruel sneer which worldly prudence bestows on active goodness and the cool derision it expresses at the defeat of a benevolent scheme of which malice rather than penetration had foreseen the failure Alas there is little need of any such discouragements The world is a climate which too naturally chills a glowing generosity and contracts an expanded heart The zeal of the most sanguine is but too apt to cool and the activity of the most diligent to slacken of itself and  the disappointments which Benevolence encounters in the failure of her best concerted projects and the frequent depravity of the most chosen objects of her bounty would soon dry up the amplest streams of charity were they not fed by the living fountain of religious principle  I cannot dismiss this part of my subject without animadverting on the too prompt alacrity even of worthy people to disseminate in public and general conversation instances of their unsuccessful attempts  to do good I never hear a charity story begun to be related in mixed company that I do not tremble for the catastrophe lest it should exhibit some mortifying disappointment which may deter the inexperienced from running any generous hazards and excite harsh suspicions at an age when it is less dishonourable to meet with a few casual hurts and transient injuries than to go cased in the cumbersome and impenetrable armour of distrust The liberal should be particularly cautious how they furnish the avaricious with creditable pretences for saying their  money as all the instances of the mortifications of the humane are added to the armory of the covetous man's arguments and produced as defensive weapons upon every fresh attack on his heart or his purse  But I am willing to hope that that uncharitableness which we so often meet with in persons of advanced years is not always the effect of a heart naturally hard Misanthropy is very often nothing but abused sensibility Long habits of the world and a melancholy conviction how little good he has been able to  do in it hardens many a tender hearted person The milk of human kindness becomes soured by repeated acts of ingratitude This commonly induces an indifference to the wellbeing of others and a hopelessness of adding to the stock of human virtue and human happiness This uncomfortable disease is very fond of spreading its own contagion which is a cruelty to the health of young and uninfected virtueFor this distemper generated by a too sanguine disposition and grown chronical from repeated disappointments there is but one  remedy or rather one prevention and this is a genuine principle of piety He who is once convinced that he is to assist his fellow creatures because it is the will of God and one of the conditions of obtaining his favour will soon get above all uneasiness when the consequence does not answer his expectation He will soon become only anxious to do his duty humbly committing events to higher hands Disappointments will then only serve to refine his motives and purify his virtue His charity will then become a sacrifice less unworthy of  the altar on which it is offered His affections will be more spiritualized and his devotions more intense Nothing short of such a courageous piety can preserve a heart hackneyed in the world from relaxed diligence or criminal despair  People in general are not aware of the mischief of judging of the rightness of any action by its prosperity or of the excellence of any institution by the abuse of it We must never proportion our exertions to our success but to our duty If every laudable undertaking were to be  dropped because it failed in some cases or was abused in others there would not be left an AlmsHouse a CharitySchool or an Hospital in the land And if every right practice were to be discontinued because it had been found not to be successful in every instance this false reasoning pushed to the extreme might at last be brought as an argument for shutting up our churches and burning our bibles  But if on the one hand there is a proud and arrogant discretion which ridicules as Utopian and romantic  every generous project of the active and the liberal so there is on the other a sort of popular bounty which arrogates to itself the exclusive name of  feeling  and rejects with disdain the influence of an higher principle I am far from intending to depreciate this humane and exquisitely tender sentiment which the beneficent Author of our nature gave us as a stimulus to remove the distresses of others in order to get rid of our own uneasiness I would only observe that where not strengthened by superior motives it is a casual and precarious  instrument of good and ceases to operate except in the immediate presence and within the audible cry of misery This sort of feeling for gets that any calamity exists which is out of its own fight and though it would empty its purse for such an occasional object as rouses transient sensibility yet it seldom makes any stated provision for miseries which are not the less real because they do not obtrude upon the fight and awaken the tenderness of immediate sympathy This is a mechanical charity which requires springs and wheels to set it a going whereas  real Christian charity does not wait to be acted upon by impressions and impulses  Another cause which very much intimidates welldisposed people is their terror lest the character of piety should derogate from their reputation as men of sense Every man of the world naturally arrogates to himself the superiority of understanding over every religious man He therefore who has been accustomed to set a high value on his intellectual powers must have made very considerable advances in piety before he  can acquire a magnanimous indifference to this usurped superiority before he can submit to the parsimonious allotment of wit and learning which is assigned him by the supercilious hand of worldly wisdom But this attack upon his pride will be the best touchstone of his sincerity If his advances have not been so considerable then by an hypocrisy of the least common kind he will be industrious to appear less good than he really is lest the detection of his serious propensities should draw on him the imputation of ordinary parts or low attainments But the danger  is that while he is too sedulously intent on maintaining his pretensions as an ingenious man his claims to piety should daily become weaker That which is long suppressed is too frequently extinguished For this reason principally it is to be regretted that religious conversation should be so carefully banished from polite company Were it otherwise young and bashful piety instead of being afraid to shew its head would be cultivated cherished and encouraged For while we are beings compounded of passion as well as intellect the devotion of the  generality is not so purely spiritual as not to stand in need of every external and collateral help Fire is too apt to be extinguished without the aid of such material fuel as is possessed of igneous particles  Nothing perhaps more plainly discovers the faint impression which religion has really made upon our hearts than this disinclination even of good people to serious conversation Let me not be misunderstood I do not mean the wrangle of debate I do not mean the gall of controversy I do not mean the fiery  strife of  opinions  than which nothing can be less favourable to good nature good manners or good society But it were to be wished that it was not thought illbred and indiscreet that the escapes of the tongue should now and then betray the "fullness of the heart" that when such subjects are casually introduced a discouraging coldness did not instantly take place of that sprightly animation of countenance which made common topics interesting If these  outward and visible signs  were unequivocal we should form but moderate ideas of the inward  and spiritual grace It were to be wished that such subjects were not thought dull  merely  because they are good that they had the common chance of fair discussion and that parts and learning were not ashamed to exert themselves on occasions where both might appear to so much advantage If the heart were really interested could the affections forbear now and then to break out into language Artists physicians merchants lawyers and scholars keep up the spirit of their professions by mutual intercourse New lights are struck out improvements are  suggested emulation is kindled love of the object is inflamed mistakes are rectified and desire of excellence is excited by communication And is piety alone so very easy of acquisition so very natural to our corrupt hearts or so certainly progressive of itself as to require none of the helps which are indispensable on all other subjects Travellers who are to visit any particular country are full of earnest inquiry and diligent research they think nothing indifferent by which their future pleasure or advantage may be affected Every hint which  may procure them any information or caution them against any danger is thankfully received and all this because they are really in  earnest  in their preparation for this journey and do fully  believe  not only that there is such a country but that they have a personal interest in the good or evil which may be found in it  A farther danger to good kind of people seems to arise from a mistaken idea that only great and actual sins are to be guarded against Whereas sins of omission make up  perhaps the most formidable part of  their  catalogue of offences These generally supply in number what they want in weight and are the more dangerous for being little ostensible They continue to be repeated with less regret because the remembrance of their predecessors does not like the remembrance of formal actual crimes assume a body and a shape and terrify by the impression of particular scenes and circumstances While the memory of transacted evil haunts a tender conscience by perpetual apparition omitted duty having no  local or personal existence not being recorded by standing acts and deeds and having no distinct image to which the mind may recur sinks into quiet oblivion without deeply wounding the conscience or tormenting the imagination These omissions were perhaps among the "secret sins" from which the royal penitent so earnestly desired to be cleansed and it is worthy of the most serious consideration that these are the offences against which the Gospel pronounces very alarming denunciations It is not less against negative than actual evil that affectionate  exhortation lively remonstrance and pointed parable are exhausted It is against the tree which bore NO fruit the lamp which had NO oil the unprofitable servant who made NO use of his talent that the severe sentence is denounced as well as against  corrupt  fruit  bad  oil and talents  ill  employed We are led to believe from the same high authority that omitted duties and neglected opportunities will furnish no inconsiderable portion of our future condemnation A very awful part of the decision in the great day of account seems to be  reserved merely for omissions and negatives Ye gave me NO meat ye gave me NO drink ye took me NOT in ye visited me NOT On the punishment attending positive crimes as being more naturally obvious more logically consequent it was not perhaps thought so necessary to insist  Another cause which still further impedes the reception of religion even among the welldisposed is that garment of sadness in which people delight to suppose her dressed and that life of hard austerity and  pining abstinence which they pretend she enjoins her disciples And it were well if this were only the misrepresentation of her declared enemies but unhappily it is the too frequent misconception of her injudicious friends But such an overcharged picture is not more unamiable than it is unlike for I will venture to affirm that Religion with all her beautiful and becoming sanctity imposes fewer sacrifices not only of rational but of pleasurable enjoyment than the uncontrolled dominion of any one vice Her service is not only perfect safety  but perfect freedom She is not so tyrannizing as Passion so exacting as the World nor so despotic as Fashion Let us try the case by a parallel and examine it not as affecting our virtue but our pleasure Does Religion forbid the cheerful enjoyments of life as rigorously as Avarice forbids them Does she require such sacrifices of our ease as Ambition or such renunciations of our quiet as Pride Does Devotion  murder sleep  like Dissipation Does she destroy Health like Intemperance Does she annihilate Fortune like Gaming Does  she imbitter Life like Discord or abridge it like Duelling Does Religion impose more vigilance than Suspicion or half as many mortifications as Vanity Vice has her martyrs and the most austere and selfdenying Ascetic who mistakes the genius of Christianity almost as much as her enemies never tormented himself with such cruel and causeless severity as that with which Envy lacerates her unhappy votaries Worldly honour obliges us to be at the trouble of resenting injuries but Religion spares us that inconvenience by commanding us to forgive them  and by this injunction consults our happiness no less than our virtue for the torment of constantly hating any one must be at least equal to the sin of itIf this estimate be fairly made then is the balance clearly on the side of Religion even in the article of pleasure  It is an infirmity not uncommon to good kind of people to comfort themselves that they live in the exercise of some one natural good quality and to make a religious merit of a constitutional happiness They have also a strong propensity to separate  what God has joined belief and practice the creed and the commandments actions and motives moral duty and religious obedience Whereas you will hardly find in all the New Testament a moral or a social virtue that is not hedged in by some religious injunction scarcely a good action enjoined towards others but it is connected to some exhortation to personal purity All the charities of benevolence are in general so agreeable to the natural make of the heart that it is a very tender mercy of God to have made that a duty which to finer spirits  would have been irresistible as an inclination and to annex the highest future reward to the greatest present pleasure But in order to give a religious sanction to a social virtue the duty of visiting the fatherless and widow in their affliction is inseparably attached to the difficult and selfdenying injunction of keeping ourselves unspotted from the world This adjunct is the more needful as many are apt to make a kind of moral commutation and to allow themselves so much pleasure in exchange for so much charity But one good quality can never stand proxy for another The Christian  virtues derive their highest lustre from association they have such a spirit of society that they are weak and imperfect when solitary their radiance is brightened by communication and their natural strength multiplied by their alliance with each other  It cannot be denied that good sort of people sometimes use religion as the voluptuous use physic As the latter employ medicine to make health agree with luxury the former consider religion as a medium to reconcile peace of conscience with a  life of pleasure But no moral chemistry can blend natural contradictions the world will still be uppermost and religion will disdain to coalesce with its antipathy  Let me not be suspected of intending to insinuate that religion encourages men to fly from society and hide themselves in solitudes to renounce the generous and important duties of active life for the visionary cold and fruitless virtues of an Hermitage or a Cloyster No the mischief arises not from our living in the world but from the  world living in us occupying our hearts and monopolizing our affections Action is the life of virtue and the world is the noblest theatre of action Perhaps some of the most perfect patterns of human conduct may be found in the most public stations and among the busiest orders of mankind It is indeed a scene of trial but the glory of the triumph is proportioned to the peril of the conflict A sense of danger quickens circumspection and makes virtue more vigilant Lot maintained his integrity in a great city proverbially  wicked and forfeited it in the bosom of retirement  It has been said that worldly good sort of people are a greater credit to their profession by exhibiting more cheerfulness gaiety and happiness than are visible in serious Christians If this assertion be true which I very much suspect is it not probable that the apparent ease and gaiety of the former may be derived from the same source of consolation which Mrs Quickly recommends to Falstaff in Shakespeare's admirable picture of the deathbed scene  of that witty profligate  He wished for comfort quoth mine hostess and began to talk of God now I to comfort him begged him he should not think of God it was time enough to trouble himself with these things  Do not many deceive themselves by drawing water from these dry wells of comfort and patch up a precarious and imperfect happiness in this world by diverting their attention from the concerns of the next  Another obstruction to the growth of piety is that unhappy prejudice  which even good kind of people too often entertain against those who differ from them in opinion Every man who is sincerely in earnest to advance the interests of religion will have acquired such a degree of candour as to become indifferent by whom good is done or who has the reputation of doing it provided it be actually done He will be anxious to increase the stock of human virtue and of human happiness by every possible means He will whet and sharpen every instrument of goodness though it be not cast in his own mould or fashioned  after his own pattern He will never consider whether the form suits his own particular taste but whether the instrument itself be calculated to accomplish the work of his master It is a test by which he will be able to judge of his own sincerity if the delight he feels at hearing of a meritorious action suffers no abatement because it was performed by one who differs from him in his religious or even his political sentiments  I shall conclude these loose and immethodical hints with a general  address to those who content themselves with a decent profession of the doctrines instead of a diligent discharge of the duties of Christianity Believe and forgive meyou are the people who lower religion in the eyes of its enemies The openly prophane  In the last days shall come scoffers walking after their own lusts c c Peter chap iii ver ▪ with a multitude of other texts to the same purpose  the avowed enemies to God and goodness confirm the truths they mean to oppose illustrate the doctrines they deny and  accomplish the predictions they disbelieve But you like an inadequate and faithless prop overturn the edifice which you pretend to supportWhen an acute and keeneyed infidel measures your lives with the rule by which you profess to walk he finds so little analogy between them the copy is so unlike the pattern that this inconsistency of yours is the pass through which his most dangerous attack is made And I must confess that of all the arguments which the malignant industry of infidelity has been able to muster the conduct of professing  Christians seems to me to be the only one which is really capable of staggering a man of senseHe hears of a spiritual and selfdenying religion he reads the beatitudes he observes that the grand artillery of the Gospel is planted against pride He then turns to the transcript of this perfect original the lives which pretend to be fashioned by it There he sees with triumphant derision that pride selflove selfsufficiency unbounded personal expence and an inordinate appetite for pleasure are reputable vices in the eyes of many of those who acknowledge  the truth of the Christian doctrines He weighs that meekness to which a blessing is promised with that arrogance which is too common to be very dishonourable He compares that nonconformity to the world which the Bible makes the criterion of a believer with that rage for amusement which is not considered as disreputable in a Christian He opposes the selfdenying and lowly character of the Author of our faith with the sensual practices of his followers He finds little resemblance between the restraints prescribed and the gratifications  indulged in What conclusions must a speculative reasoning sceptic draw from such premises Is it any wonder that such phrases as a broken spirit a contrite heart poverty of spirit refraining the soul keeping it low and casting down high imaginations should be to the unbeliever "foolishness" when such humiliating doctrines are a  stumbling block  to professing Christians who cannot always cordially relish a religion which professedly tells them it was sent to stain the pride of human glory and to exclude boasting  But though the passive and selfdenying virtues are not high in the esteem of mere good sort of people yet they are peculiarly the evangelical virtues The world extols brilliant actions the Gospel enjoins good habits and right motives it seldom inculcates those splendid deeds which make heroes or those sounding sentences which constitute philosophers but it enjoins the harder task of renouncing self of living uncorrupted in the world of subduing besetting sins and of not thinking of ourselves more highly than we ought The acquisition of  glory was the precept of other religions the contempt of it is the perfection of Christianity  Let us then be consistent and we shall never be contemptible even in the eyes of our enemies Let not the unbeliever say that we have one set of opinions for our theory and another for our practice that to the vulgar  We shew the rough and thorny way to heav'n  While we the primrose path of dalliance tread  It would become our characters as men of sense of which consistency  is a most unequivocal proof to choose some rule and abide by it An extempore Christian is a ridiculous character Fixed principles will be followed by a consistent course of action while indecision of spirit will produce instability of conduct If there be a model which we profess to admire let us square our lives by it If the Koran of Mahomet or the Revelations of Zoroaster be a perfect guide let us follow one of them If either Epicurus Zeno or Confucius be the peculiar object of our veneration and respect let us fashion our conduct  by the dictates of their philosophy and then though we may be wrong we shall not be absurd But if the Bible be in truth the word of God as we profess to believe we need look no farther for a consummate pattern Let us then make it the rule of our practice here if it is indeed to be the rule of our judgment hereafter  But I am willing to flatter myself that the moral and intellectual scene about us begins to brighten I indulge myself in moments of the most enthusiastic and delightful vision  taking encouragement from that glorious prophecy that  of the increase of his government there shall be no end  A prediction which seems to be gradually accomplishing and in no instance more perhaps than in the noble attempt about to be made for the abolition of the African slavetrade For what event can human wisdom foresee more likely to contribute to  give the SON the Heathen for his inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession  than the success of such an enterprize which will restore the  lustre of the Christian name too long sullied with oppression cruelty and injustice  A good spirit seems to be at work A catholic temper is diffusing itself among all sects and parties an enlightened candour and a liberal toleration were never more prevalent good men combat each other's opinions with less rancour and better manners We have many public encouragements we have a pious king a wise and virtuous minister many respectable and not a few serious clergy May their number  daily increase Among these some of the first in dignity are the first in conduct An increasing desire to instruct the poor to inform the ignorant and to reclaim the vicious is spreading among us The late Royal Proclamation affords an honourable sanction to virtuous endeavours and lends nerves and sinews to the otherwise feeble exertions of individuals by inforcing laws wisely planned but hitherto feebly executed In short there is a good hope that we shall more and more become that happy people who have the Lord for their God that as  prosperity is already within our walls peace and virtue may abide in our dwellings  But vain will be all endeavours after  partial  and  subordinate  amendment Reformation must begin with the GREAT or it will never be effectual  Their  example is the fountain from whence the vulgar draw their habits actions and characters To expect to reform the poor while the opulent are corrupt is to throw odours into the stream while the springs are poisoned Even the excellent institution of  Sunday schools for training religious servants will avail but little if as soon as the persons there educated come into the families of the great they behold practices diametrically opposite to the instructions they have been imbibing If they fall into the houses of the profligate they will hear the doctrines which they have been taught to reverence derided if into mere worldly families they will see them neglected and to the essential principle of vital Christianity oblivion is scarcely less fatal than contempt  If therefore the rich and great will not from a liberal spirit of doing right abstain from those offences for which the poor are to suffer fines and imprisonments effectual good cannot be done It will signify little to lay penalties on the horses of the drover or on the waggon of the husbandman while the chariot wheels of the great roll with incessant motion and the sacred day on which the sons of industry are commanded by royal proclamation to desist from travelling is for that very reason selected for the journeys of the great and preferred because  the road is encumbered with fewer interruptions But will it not strike every wellmeaning Sunday traveller with a generous remorse when he reflects that he owes the accommodation of an unobstructed road to the very obedience which is paid by others to that divine and human law which he is in the very act of violating  Will not the common people think it a little inequitable that they are abridged of the diversions of the publichouse and the gaming yard on Sunday evening when they shall hear  that many houses of the first nobility are on that evening crowded with company and such amusements carried on as are prohibited by human laws even on common days As imitation and a desire of being in the fashion govern the lower orders of mankind it is to be feared that they will not think reformation reputable while they see it recommended only and not practised by their betters A precept counteracted by an example is worse than fruitless it is ridiculous and the common people will be tempted to set an inferior value on goodness  when they find it is only expected from the lower ranks They cannot surely but smile at the disinterestedness of their superiors who while they seem anxiously concerned to save others are so little solicitous about their own state The ambitious vulgar will hardly relish a salvation which is only intended for Plebeians nor will they be apt to entertain very exalted notions of that promised future reward the road to which they perceive their betters are so much more earnest to point out to  them  than to walk in themselves  It was not by inflicting pains and penalties that Christianity first made its way into the world the divine truths it inculcated received irresistible confirmation from the LIVES PRACTICES and EXAMPLES of its venerable professors These were arguments which no popular prejudice could resist no Jewish logic refute and no Pagan persecution discredit Had the primitive Christians only  praised  and  promulgated  the most perfect religion the world ever saw it could have produced but very slender effects on the faith and manners of the people if the  jealous and inquisitive eye of malice could have detected that the DOCTRINES they recommended had not been illustrated by the LIVES they led  POSTSCRIPT  THE public favour having already brought this little Essay to a second edition the author has been sedulous to discover any particular objections that have been made to it Since the preceding sheets were printed off it has been suggested by some very respectable persons who have honoured this slight performance with their notice that it inculcates a too rigid austerity and carries the point of observing Sunday much too far that it takes away  all the usual occupations of the day without substituting any others in their stead and that it only pulls down a wrong system without so much as attempting to build up a right one The author begs leave to observe in his own defence that in animadverting on error he purposely avoided insisting on obvious duty To tell people what they already know to be right was less the intention of this address than to observe upon practices which long habit had prevented them from perceiving to be wrong Sensible and wellmeaning persons can hardly be  at a loss on a subject which has exhausted precept and wearied exhortation To have expatiated on it would only have been to repeat what is already known and acknowledged to be right even by those whom the hurry of engagements will not allow to take breath one day in a week that they may run the race of pleasure with more alacrity on the other fix But probably it is not the duties but the amusements appropriated to the day about which the inquiry is made It will perhaps be found that the intervals of a Sunday regularly devoted to all its reasonable  and obvious duties are not likely to be so very tedious but that they might be easily and pleasantly filled up by cheerful innocent and instructive conversation Human delights would be very circumscribed indeed if the practices here noticed as erroneous included the whole circle of enjoyment Are the pleasures of retirement the pleasures of friendship the pleasures of intellect and the pleasures of beneficence to be estimated as nothing  There will not be found perhaps a single person who shall honour  these pages with a perusal who has not been repeatedly told with an air of imposing gravity by those who produce cards on a Sunday evening  that it is better to play than to talk scandal  Before this pithy axiom was invented it was not perhaps suspected that Sunday gaming would ever be adduced as an argument in favour of morals Without entering into the comparative excellence of these two occupations or presuming to determine which has a claim to preeminence of piety one may venture to be thankful that these alternatives do not seem to  empty the whole stock of human resource  People in the gay and elegant scenes of life are perpetually complaining that an extensive acquaintance and the necessity of being constantly engaged in large circles and mixed assemblies leave them little leisure for family enjoyment select conversation and domestic delights Others with no less earnestness lament that the hurry of public stations and the necessary demands of active life allow them no time for any but frivolous reading Now the recurrence  of one Sunday in every week seems to hold out an inviting remedy for both these evils The sweet and delightful pleasures of family society might then be uninterruptedly enjoyed by the habitual exclusion of trifling and idle visitors who do not come to see their friends but to get rid of themselves Persons of fashion living in the same house and connected by the closest ties whom business and pleasure keep asunder during the greatest part of the week would then have an opportunity of spending a little time together and of cultivating that friendship for  each other and that affection for their children to which the present manners are not  very  favourable As to the other set of complainers those who can find no time to read this interval naturally presents itself and it luckily happens that some of the most enlightened men the world ever saw have not unfrequently devoted their rare talents to subjects peculiarly suited to this day and that not merely in the didactic form of sermons which men of the world affect to disdain but in every alluring shape which human ingenuity could assume It  luckily happens among a thousand other instances that the deepest metaphysician  Locke Newton Milton Butler Addison Bacon Boyle  the greatest astronomer the sublimest poet the acutest reasoner the politest writer the most consummate philosopher and the profoundest investigator of nature which this or perhaps any country has produced have all written on such subjects as are analogous to the business of this day Such authors as these even wits philosophers and men of the world  must acknowledge that it is not bigotry to read nor enthusiasm to commend Of this illustrious groupe only  one  was a clergyman which to some readers will be a strong recommendation though it is a little hard that the fastidiousness of modern taste should undervalue the learned and pious labours of divines only because they are  professional  In every other function a man's compositions are not the less esteemed because they peculiarly belong to his more immediate business Blackstone's opinions in jurisprudence are of unquestionable validity  though he was a lawyer Sydenham is still consulted as oracular in fevers in spite of his having been a physician and the commentaries of Caesar are of established authority in military operations notwithstanding he was a soldier  FINIS
