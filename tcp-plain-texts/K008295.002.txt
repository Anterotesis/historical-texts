 THE RAMBLER  VOLUME THE SECOND  Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri  Quo me cunque rapit tempestas deferor hospes  HOR  LONDON  Printed for J PAYNE and J BOUQUET IN PATERNOSTER ROW MDCCLII  THE RAMBLER  NUMB  TUESDAY  July    Non pronuba  Juno    Non  Hymenaeus  adest non illi  Gratia  lecto  OVID  To the RAMBLER  SIR  AS you have hitherto delayed the performance of the promise by which you gave us reason to hope for another paper upon matrimony I imagine you desirous of collecting more materials than your own experience or observation can supply and I shall therefore lay candidly before you an account of my own entrance into the conjugal state  I WAS about eight and twenty years old when having tried the diversions of the town till I began to be weary and being awakened into some attention to more serious business  by the failure of an attorney to whom I had implicitly trusted the conduct of my fortune I resolved to take my estate into my own care and methodise my whole life according to the strictest rules of oeconomical prudence  IN persuance of this scheme I took leave of my acquaintance who dismissed me with numberless jests upon my new system but first endeavoured to divert me from a design so little worthy of a man of wit by ridiculous accounts of the ignorance and rusticity into which many had sunk in their retirement after having distinguished themselves for some years in taverns and playhouses and given hopes of rising to uncommon eminence among the gay part of mankind  WHEN I came first into the country which by a neglect not uncommon among young heirs I had never seen since the death of my father I found every thing in such confusion that being utterly without practice in business I had great difficulties to encounter in disentangling the perplexity of my circumstances they however at last gave way to diligent application and I soon perceived that the advantage of keeping my own accounts  would very much overbalance the time which they could require  I HAD now visited all my tenants surveyed all my land and repaired the old house which for some years had been running to decay These proofs of pecuniary wisdom began to recommend me as a sober judicious thriving gentleman to all my graver neighbours of the country who never failed to celebrate my management in opposition to  Thriftless  and  Latterwit  two smart fellows who had estates in the same part of the kingdom which they visited now and then in a frolick to take up their rents beforehand debauch a milkmaid make a feast for the village and tell stories of their own intrigues and then rode post back to town to spend their money  IT was doubtful however for some time whether I should be able to hold my resolution but a short perseverance removed all suspicions I rose every day in reputation by the decency of my conversation and the regularity of my conduct and was mentioned with great regard at the assizes as a man very fit to be put in commission for the peace  DURING the confusion of my affairs and the daily necessity of visiting farms adjusting contracts letting leases and superintending repairs together with the civilities which were at my first arrival to be paid or returned I found very little vacuity in my life and therefore had not many thoughts of marriage but in a little while the tumult of business subsided and the exact method which I had established enabled me to dispatch my accounts with great facility I had therefore now upon my hands the task of finding means to spend my time without falling back into the poor amusements which I had hitherto indulged or changing them for the sports of the field which I saw persued with so much eagerness by the gentlemen of the country that they were indeed the only pleasures in which I could promise myself any partaker  THE inconvenience of this situation naturally disposed me to wish for a companion and the known value of my estate with my reputation for frugality and prudence easily gained me admission into every family for I soon sound that no enquiry was made after any other virtue nor any testimonial necessary  but of my freedom from incumbrances and my care of what they termed the  main chance  I confess I could not see without some indignation the eagerness with which the daughters wherever I came were set out to show nor could I consider them in a state much different from prostitution when I found them ordered to play their airs before me and to exhibit by some seeming chance specimens of their musick their work or their housewifery No sooner was I placed at table than the young lady was called upon to pay me some civility or other nor could I find means of escaping from either father or mother some account of their daughter's excellencies with a declaration that they were now leaving the world and had no business on this side the grave but to see their children happily disposed of that she whom I had been pleased to compliment at table was indeed the chief pleasure of their age so good so dutiful so great a relief to her mamma in the care of the house and so much her pappa's favourite for her chearfulness and wit that it would be with the last reluctance that they should part but to a worthy gentleman in the neighbourhood whom they might often visit they would not so far consult their own gratification  as to refuse her and their tenderness should be shewn in her fortune when ever a suitable settlement was proposed  AS I knew these overtures not to proceed from any preference of me before another equally rich I could not but look with pity on young persons condemned to be set to auction and made cheap by injudicious commendations for how could they know themselves offered and rejected a hundred times without some loss of that soft elevation and maiden dignity so necessary to the completion of female excellence  I SHALL not trouble you with a history of the stratagems practised upon my judgment or the allurements tried upon my heart which if you have in any part of your life been acquainted with rural politicks you will easily conceive Their arts have no great variety they think nothing worth their care but money and supposing its influence the same upon all the world seldom endeavour to deceive by any other means than false computations  I WILL not deny that by hearing myself loudly commended for my discretion I began  to set some value upon my character and was unwilling to lose my credit by marrying for love I therefore resolved to know the fortune of the lady whom I should address before I enquired after her wit delicacy or beauty  THIS determination led me to Mitissa the daughter of Chrysophilus whose person was at least without deformity and whose manners were free from reproach as she had been bred up at a distance from all common temptations To Mitissa therefore I obtained leave from her parents to pay my court and was referred by her again to her father whose direction she was resolved to follow The question then was only what should be settled The old gentleman made an enormous demand with which I refused to comply Mitissa was ordered to exert her power she told me that if I could refuse her papa I had no love for her that she was an unhappy creature and that I was a perfidious man then she burst into tears and fell into fits All this as I was no passionate lover had little effect She next refused to see me and because I thought myself obliged to write in terms of distress they had once hopes of starving me into measures but finding me inflexible the father complied  with my proposal and told me he liked me the more for being so good at a bargain  I WAS now married to Mitissa and was to experience the happiness of a match made without passion Mitissa soon discovered that she was equally prudent with myself and had taken a husband only to be at her own command and to have a chariot at her own call She brought with her an old maid recommended by her mother who taught her all the arts of domestick management and was on every occasion her chief agent and directress They soon invented one reason or other to quarrel with all my servants and either prevailed on me to turn them away or treated them so ill they left me of themselves and always supplied their places with some brought from her own relations Thus they established a family over which I had no authority and which was in a perpetual conspiracy against me for Mitissa considered herself as having a separate interest and thought nothing her own but what she laid up without my knowledge For this reason she brought me false accounts of the expences of the house joined with my tenants in complaints of hard times and by means of a steward of  her own took rewards for soliciting abatements of the rent Her great hope is to outlive me that she may enjoy what she has thus accumulated and therefore she is always contriving some improvements of her jointure land and once tried to procure an injunction to hinder me from felling timber upon it for repairs Her father and mother assist her in her projects and are frequently hinting that she is ill used and reproaching me with the presents that other ladies receive from their husbands  SUCH Sir was my situation for seven years till at last my patience was exhausted and having one day invited her father to my house I laid the state of my affairs before him detected my wife in several of her frauds turned out her steward charged a constable with her maid took my business in my own hands reduced her to a settled allowance and now write this account to warn others against marrying those whom they have no reason to esteem  I am c  NUMB  SATURDAY  July    HOMER  THERE is scarcely any species of poetry that has allured more readers or excited more writers than the pastoral It is generally pleasing because it entertains the mind with representations of scenes familiar to almost every imagination and of which all can equally judge whether they are well described It exhibits a life to which we have been always accustomed to associate peace and leisure and innocence and therefore we readily set open the heart for the admission of its images which contribute to drive away cares and perturbations and suffer ourselves without resistance to be transported to elysian regions where we are to meet with nothing but joy and plenty and contentment where every gale whispers pleasure and every shade promises repose  IT has been maintained by some who love to talk of what they do not know that pastoral  is the most antient poetry and indeed since it is probable that poetry is nearly of the same antiquity with rational nature and since the life of the first men was certainly rural we may reasonably conjecture that as their ideas would necessarily be borrowed from those objects with which they were acquainted their composures being filled chiefly with such thoughts on the visible creation as must occur to the first observers were pastoral hymns like those which  Milton  introduces the original pair singing in the day of innocence to the praise of their maker  FOR the same reason that pastoral poetry was the first employment of the human imagination it is generally the first literary amusement of our minds We have seen fields and meadows and groves from the time that our eyes opened upon life and are pleased with birds and brooks and breezes much earlier than we engage among the actions and passions of mankind We are therefore delighted with rural pictures because we know the original at an age when our curiosity can be very little awakened by descriptions of courts which we never beheld or representations of passion which we never felt  THE satisfaction received from this kind of writing not only begins early but lasts long we do not throw it away among other childish amusements and pastimes as we advance into the intellectual world but willingly return to it in any hour of indolence and relaxation The images of true pastoral have always the power of exciting delight because the works of nature from which they are drawn have always the same order and beauty and continue to force themselves upon our thoughts being at once obvious to the most careless regard and more than adequate to the strongest reason and severest contemplation Our inclination to stillness and tranquillity is seldom much lessened by long knowledge of the busy and tumultuary part of the world In childhood we turn our thoughts to the country as to the region of pleasure we recur to it in old age as a port of rest and perhaps with that secondary and adventitious gladness which every man feels on reviewing those places or recollecting those occurrences that contributed to his youthful enjoyments and bring him back to the prime of life when the world was gay with the bloom of novelty when  mirth wantoned at his side and hope sparkled before him  The sense of this universal pleasure has invited numbers without number to try their skill in pastoral performances in which they have generally succeeded after the manner of other imitators transmitting the same images in the same combination from one to another till he that reads the title of a poem may guess at the whole series of the composition nor will a man after the perusal of thousands of these performances find his knowledge enlarged with a single view of nature not produced before or his imagination amused with any new application of those views to moral purposes  THE range of pastoral is indeed narrow for though nature itself philosophically considered be inexhaustible yet its general effects on the eye and on the ear are uniform and incapable of much variety of description Poetry cannot dwell upon the minuter distinctions by which one species differs from another without departing from that simplicity of grandeur which fills the imagination nor diffect the latent qualities of things without  losing its general power of gratifying every mind by recalling its conceptions However as each age makes some discoveries and those discoveries are by degrees generally known as new plants or modes of culture are introduced and by little and little become common pastoral might receive from time to time small augmentations and exhibit once in a century a scene somewhat varied  BUT pastoral subjects have been often like others taken into the hands of those that were not qualified to adorn them men to whom the face of nature was so little known that they have drawn it only after their own imagination and changed or distorted her features that their portraits might appear something more than servile copies from their predecessors  NOT only the images of rural life but the occasions on which they can be properly produced are few and general The state of a man confined to the employments and pleasures of the country is so little diversified and exposed to so few of those accidents which produce perplexities terrors and surprises in more complicated transactions that he can be  shewn but seldom in such circumstances as attract curiosity His ambition is without policy and his love without intrigue He has no complaints to make of his rival but that he is richer than himself nor any disasters to lament but a cruel mistress or a bad harvest  THE conviction of the necessity of some new source of pleasure induced  Sannazarius  to substitute fishermen for shepherds to remove the scene from the fields to the sea and derive his sentiments from the piscatory life for which he has been censured by succeeding criticks because the sea is an object of terrour and by no means proper to amuse the mind and lay the passions asleep Against this objection he might be defended by the established maxim that the poet has a right to select his images and is no more obliged to shew the sea in a storm than the land under an inundation but may display all the pleasures and conceal the dangers of the water as he may lay his shepherd under a shady beech without giving him an ague or letting a wild beast loose upon him  THERE are however two defects in the piscatory eclogue which perhaps cannot be supplied  The sea though in hot countries it is considered by those who live like  Sannazarius  upon the coast as a place of pleasure and diversion has notwithstanding much less variety than the land and therefore will be sooner exhausted by a descriptive writer When he has once shewn the sun rising or setting upon it curled its waters with the vernal breeze rolled the waves in gentle succession to the shore and enumerated the fish sporting in the shallows he has nothing remaining but what is common to all other poetry the complaint of a nymph for a drowned lover or the indignation of a fisher that his oysters are refused and Mycon's accepted  ANOTHER obstacle to the general reception of this kind of poetry is the ignorance of maritime pleasures in which the greater part of mankind must always live To all the inland inhabitants of every region the sea is only known as an immense diffusion of waters over which men pass from one country to another and in which life is frequently lost They have therefore no opportunity of tracing in their own thoughts the descriptions of winding shores and calm bays nor can look on the poem in which they are mentioned  with other sensations than on a seachart or the metrical geography of  Dionysius  THIS defect  Sannazarius  was hindered from perceiving by writing in a learned language to readers generally acquainted with the works of nature but if he had made his attempt in any vulgar tongue he would soon have discovered how vainly he had endeavoured to make that loved which was not understood  I AM afraid it will not be found easy to improve the pastorals of antiquity by any great additions or diversifications Our descriptions may indeed differ from those of Virgil as an English from an Italian summer and in some respects as modern from antient life but as nature is in both countries nearly the same and as poetry has to do rather with the passions of men which are uniform than their customs which are changeable the varieties which time or place can furnish will be inconsiderable and I shall endeavour to shew in the next paper how little the latter ages have contributed to the improvement of the rustick muse  NUMB  TUESDAY  July    Canto quae solitus si quando armenta vocabat  Amphion Dircaeus  VIRG  IN writing or judging of pastoral poetry neither the authors nor criticks of latter times seem to have paid sufficient regard to the originals left us by antiquity but have entangled themselves with unnecessary difficulties by advancing principles which having no foundation in the nature of things are wholly to be rejected from a species of composition in which above all others mere nature is to be regarded  IT is therefore necessary to enquire after some more distinct and exact idea of this kind of writing This may I think be easily found in the pastorals of Virgil from whose opinion it will not appear very safe to depart if we consider that every advantage of nature and of fortune concurred to complete his productions that he was born with great accuracy and severity of judgment enlightened  with all the learning of one of the brightest ages and embellished with the elegance of the Roman court that he employed his powers rather in improving than inventing and therefore must have endeavoured to recompense the want of novelty by exactness that taking Theocritus for his original he found pastoral far advanced towards perfection and that having so great a rival he must have proceeded with uncommon caution  IF we search the writings of Virgil for the true definition of a pastoral it will be found  a poem in which any action or passion is represented by its effects upon a country life  Whatsoever therefore may according to the common course of things happen in the country may afford a subject for a pastoral poet  IN this definition it will immediately occur to those who are versed in the writings of the modern criticks that there is no mention of the golden age I cannot indeed easily discover why it is thought necessary to refer descriptions of a rural state to remote times nor can I perceive that any writer has consistently preserved the Arcadian manners and sentiments The only reason that I have read on which  this rule has been sounded is that according to the customs of modern life it is improbable that shepherds should be capable of harmonious numbers or delicate sentiments and therefore the reader must exalt his ideas of the pastoral character by carrying his thoughts back to the age in which the care of herds and flocks was the employment of the wisest and greatest men  THESE reasoners seem to have been led into their hypothesis by considering pastoral not in general as a representation of rural nature and consequently as exhibiting the ideas and sentiments of those whoever they are to whom the country affords pleasure or employment but simply as a dialogue or narrative of men actually tending sheep and busied in the lowest and most laborious offices from whence they very readily concluded since characters must necessarily be preserved that either the sentiments must sink to the level of the speakers or the speakers must be raised to the height of the sentiments  IN consequence of these original errors a thousand precepts have been given which have only contributed to perplex and to confound  Some have thought it necessary that the imaginary manners of the golden age should be universally preserved and have therefore believed that nothing more could be admitted in pastoral than lilies and roses and rocks and streams among which are heard the gentle whispers of chaste fondness or the soft complaints of amorous impatience In pastoral as in other writings chastity of sentiment ought doubtless to be observed and purity of manners to be represented not because the poet is confined to the images of the golden age but because having the subject in his own choice he ought always to consult the interest of virtue  THESE advocates for the golden age lay down other principles not very consistent with their general plan for they tell us that to support the character of the shepherd it is proper that all refinement should be avoided and that some slight instances of ignorance should be interspersed Thus the shepherd in Virgil is supposed to have forgot the name of Anaximander and in Pope the term Zodiack is too hard for a rustick apprehension But if we place our shepherds in their primitive condition we may give them learning among  their other qualifications and if we suffer them to allude at all to things of later existence which perhaps cannot with any great propriety be allowed there can be no danger of making them speak with too much accuracy since they conversed with divinities and transmitted to succeeding ages the arts of life  OTHER writers having the mean and despicable condition of a shepherd always before them conceive it necessary to degrade the language of pastoral by obsolete terms and rustick words which they very learnedly call Dorick without reflecting that they thus become authors of a mingled dialect which no human being ever could have spoken that they may as well refine the speech as the sentiments of their personages and that none of the inconsistencies which they endeavour to avoid is greater than that of joining elegance of thought with coarseness of diction Spenser begins one of his pastorals with studied barbarity  Diggon Davie  I bid her goodday  Or  Diggon  her is or I missay  Dig  Her was her while it was daylight  But now her is a most wretched wight  What will the reader imagine to be the subject on which speakers like these exercise their eloquence Will he not be somewhat disappointed when he finds them met together to condemn the corruptions of the church of Rome Surely at the same time that a shepherd learns theology he may gain some acquaintance with his native language  PASTORAL admits of all ranks of persons because persons of all ranks inhabit the country It excludes not therefore on account of the characters necessary to be introduced any elevation or delicacy of sentiment those ideas only are improper which not owing their original to rural objects are not pastoral Such is the exclamation in Virgil  Nunc scio quid sit Amor duris in cautibus illum  Ismarus aut Rhodope aut extremi Garamantes  Nec generis nostri puerum nec sanguinis edunt  which Pope endeavouring to copy was carried to still greater impropriety  I know thee Love wild as the raging main  More fierce than tigers on the Libyan plain  Thou wert from Etna's burning entrails torn  Begot in tempests and in thunders born  Sentiments like these as they have no ground  in nature are indeed of little value in any poem but in pastoral they are particularly liable to censure because they want that exaltation above common life which in tragick or heroick writings often reconciles us to bold flights and daring figures  PASTORAL being the  representation of an action or passion    by its effects upon a country life  has nothing peculiar but its confinement to rural imagery without which it ceases to be pastoral This is its true characteristick and this it cannot lose by any dignity of sentiment or beauty of diction The Pollio of Virgil with all its elevation is a composition truly bucolic though rejected by the criticks for all the images are either taken from the country or from the religion of the age common to all parts of the empire  The Silenus is indeed of a more disputable kind because though the scene lies in the country the song being religious and historical had been no less adapted to any other audience or place Neither can it well be defended as a fiction for the introduction of a God seems to imply the golden age and yet  he alludes to many subsequent transactions and mentions Gallus the poet's contemporary  IT seems necessary to the perfection of this poem that the occasion which is supposed to produce it be at least not inconsistent with a country life or less likely to interest those who have retired into places of solitude and quiet than the more busy part of mankind It is therefore improper to give the title of a pastoral to verses in which the speakers after the slight mention of their flocks fall to complaints of errors in the church and corruptions in the government or to lamentations of the death of some illustrious person whom when once the poet has called a shepherd he has no longer any labour upon his hands but can make the clouds weep and lilies wither and the sheep hang their heads without art or learning genius or study  IT is part of Claudian's character of his rustick that he computes his time not by the succession of consuls but of harvests Those who pass their days in retreats distant from the theatres of business are always least likely to hurry their imagination with publick affairs  THE facility of treating actions or events in the pastoral stile has incited many writers from whom more judgment might have been expected to put the sorrow or the joy which the occasion required into the mouth of Daphne or of Thyrsis and as one absurdity must naturally be expected to make way for another they have written with an utter disregard both of life and nature and filled their productions with mythological allusions with incredible fictions and with sentiments which neither passion nor reason could have dictated since the change which religion has made in the whole system of the world  NUMB  SATURDAY  July    Auream quisquis mediocritatem  Diligit tutus caret obsoleti  Sordibus tecti caret invidendâ  Sobrius aulâ  HOR  AMONG many fanciful parallels which men of more imagination than experience have drawn between the natural and moral state of the world it has been observed  that happiness as well as virtue consists in mediocrity that it is necessary even to him who has no other care than to pass through the present state with ease and safety to avoid every extreme and that the middle path is the road of security on either side of which are not only the pitfals of vice but the precipices of ruin  THUS the maxim of Cleobulus the Lindian    Mediocrity is best  has been long considered as an universal principle extended through the whole compass of life and nature The experience of every age seems to have given it new confirmation and to shew that nothing however specious or alluring is to be persued with propriety or enjoyed with safety beyond certain limits  EVEN the gifts of nature which may truly be considered as the most solid and durable of all terrestrial advantages are sound when they exceed the middle point to be no very certain causes of felicity but to draw the possessor into many calamities easily avoided by others that have been less bountifully enriched or adorned We see every day women perishing with insamy by having been too willing  to set their beauty to show and others though not with equal guilt or misery yet with very sharp remorse languishing in decay neglect and obscurity for having rated their youthful charms at too high a price And indeed if the opinion of Bacon be thought to deserve much regard very few sighs would be vented for eminent and superlative elegance of form "for beautiful women" says he "are seldom of any great accomplishments because they for the most part study behaviour rather than virtue"  HEALTH and vigour and a happy constitution of the corporeal frame are to a common degree of absolute necessity to the enjoyment of the comforts and to the performance of the duties of life and requisite in yet a greater measure to the accomplishment of any thing illustrious or distinguished yet even these if we can judge by their apparent consequences are sometimes not very beneficial to those on whom they are most liberally bestowed They that frequent the chambers of the sick will generally find the sharpest pains and most stubborn maladies among them whom confidence of the force of nature formerly betrayed to negligence and irregularity  and that superfluity of strength which was at once their boast and their snare has often in the latter part of life no other effect than that it continues them long in impotence and anguish  THESE gifts of nature are however always blessings in themselves and to be acknowledged with gratitude to him that gives them since they are in their regular and legitimate effects productive of happiness and prove pernicious only by voluntary corruption or idle negligence And as there is little danger of persuing them with too much ardour or anxiety because no skill or diligence can hope to procure them the uncertainty of their influence upon our lives is mentioned not to depreciate their real value but to repress the discontent and envy to which the want of them often gives occasion in those who do not enough suspect their own frailty nor consider how much less is the calamity of not possessing great powers than of not using them aright  OF all those things that make us superior to others there is none so much within the reach of our endeavours as riches nor any  thing more eagerly or constantly desired Poverty is an evil always in our view an evil complicated with so many circumstances of uneasiness and vexation that every man is studious to avoid it Some degree of riches is therefore required that we may be exempt from the gripe of necessity when this purpose is once attained we naturally wish for more that the evil which is regarded with so much horror may be yet at a greater distance from us as he that has once felt or dreaded the paw of a savage will not be at rest till they are parted by some barrier which may take away all possibility of a second attack  TO this point if fear be not unreasonably indulged Cleobulus would perhaps not refuse to extend his mediocrity But it almost always happens that the man who grows rich changes his notions of poverty states his wants by some new measure and from flying the enemy that persued him bends his endeavours to overtake those whom he sees before him The power of gratifying his appetites encreases their demands a thousand wishes croud in upon him importunate to be satisfied and vanity and ambition open prospects to desire  which still grow wider as they are more contemplated  THUS in time  enlarged without bounds an eagerness for increase of possessions deluges the soul and we sink into the gulphs of insatiability only because we do not sufficiently consider that all real need is very soon supplied and all real danger of its invasion easily precluded that the claims of vanity being without limits must be denied at last and that perhaps the pain of repressing them is less pungent before they have been long accustomed to comphance  WHOSOEVER shall look heedfully upon those who are eminent for their riches will not think their condition such as that he should hazard his  and much less his virtue to obtain it For all that great wealth generally gives above a moderate fortune is more room for the freaks of caprice and more privilege for ignorance and vice a quicker succession of flatteries and a larger circle of voluptuousness  THERE is one reason seldom remarked which makes riches less desirable Too much  wealth is very frequently the occasion of poverty He whom the wantonness of abundance has once softened very easily sinks into neglect of his affaris and he that thinks he can afford to be negligent is not far from being poor He will soon be involved in perplexities which his inexperience will render unsurmountable he will fly for help to those whose interest it is that he should be more distressed and will be at last torn to pieces by the vulturs that always hover over fortunes in decay  WHEN the plains of India were burnt up by a long continuance of drought Hamet and Raschid two neighbouring shepherds faint with thirst stood at the common boundary of their grounds with their flocks and herds panting round them and in extremity of distress prayed for water On a sudden the air was becalmed the birds ceased to chirp and the flocks to bleat They turned their eyes every way and saw a being of mighty stature advancing through the valley whom they know upon his nearer approach to be the Genius of distribution In one hand he held the sheaves of plenty and in the other the sabre of destruction The shepherds stood trembling  and would have retired before him but he called to them with a voice gentle as the breeze that plays in the evening among the spices of Sabaea "Fly not from your benefactor children of the dust I am come to offer you gifts which only your own folly can make vain You here pray for water and water I will bestow let me know with how much you will be satisfied speak not rashly consider that of whatever can be enjoyed by the body excess is no less dangerous than scarcity When you remember the pain of thirst do not forget the danger of suffocation Now Hamet tell me your request"  "O BEING kind and beneficent" says Hamet "let thine eye pardon my confusion I entreat a little brook which in summer shall never be dry and in winter never overflow" "It is granted" replies the Genius and immediately he opened the ground with his sabre and a fountain bubbling up under their feet scattered its rills over the meadows the flowers renewed their fragrance the trees spread a greener foliage and the flocks and herds quenched their thirst  THEN turning to Raschid the Genius invited him likewise to offer his petition "I request says Raschid that thou wilt turn the Ganges through my grounds with all his waters and all their inhabitants" Hamet was struck with the greatness of his neighbour's sentiments and secretly repined in his heart that he had not made the same petition before him when the Genius spoke "Rash man be not insatiable remember to thee that is nothing which thou canst not use and how are thy wants greater than the wants of Hamet" Raschid repeated his desire and pleased himself with the mean appearance that Hamet would make in the presence of the proprietor of the Ganges The Genius then retired towards the river and the two shepherds stood waiting the event As Raschid was looking with contempt upon his neighbour on a sudden was heard the roar of torrents and they found by the mighty stream that the mounds of the Ganges were broken The flood rolled forward into the lands of Raschid his plantations were torn up his flocks overwhelmed he was swept away before it and a crocodile devoured him  NUMB  TUESDAY  July    Infelixnulli bene nupta marito  AUSONIUS  THE condition of the female sex has been frequently the subject of compassion to medical writers because their constitution of body is such that every state of life brings its peculiar diseases they are placed according to the proverb between Scylla and Charybdis with no other choice than of dangers equally formidable and whether they embrace marriage or determine upon a single life are exposed in consequence of their choice to sickness misery and death  IT were to be wished that so great a degree of natural infelicity might not be increased by adventitious and artificial miseries and that beings whose beauty we cannot behold without admiration and whose delicacy we cannot contemplate without tenderness might be suffered to enjoy every alleviation of their sorrows But however it has happened the custom of the world seems to have been formed ed in a kind of a conspiracy against them tho  it does not appear but they had themselves an equal share in its establishment and prescriptions which by whomsoever they were begun are now of very long continuance and by consequence of great authority seem to have almost excluded them from content in whatsoever condition they shall pass their lives  IF they refuse the society of men and continue in that state which is reasonably supposed to place happiness most in their own power they seldom give those that observe their conduct or frequent their conversation any exalted notions of the blessing of liberty for whether it be that they are angry to see with what inconsiderate eagerness the rest of their sex rushes into slavery or with what absurd vanity the married ladies boast the change of their condition and condemn the heroines who endeavour by their example to assert the natural dignity of their sex whether they are conscious that like barren countries they are free only because they were never thought to deserve the trouble of a conquest or imagine that their sincerity is not always unsuspected when they declare their contempt for men it is certain that they generally appear to have  some great and incessant cause of uneasiness and that many of them have at last been persuaded by powerful rhetoricians to try the life which they had so long contemned and put on the bridal ornaments at a time when they least became them  WHAT are the real causes of the discontent and impatience which the ladies always discover in a virgin state I shall perhaps take some other occasion to examine That it is by no means to be envied for its happiness appears from the solicitude with which it is generally avoided from the opinion universally prevalent among the sex that no woman continues long in it but because she is not invited to forsake it and the disposition which they always shew to treat old maids as the refuse of the world and from the willingness with which it is often quitted at last by those whose experience has enabled them to judge at leisure and decide with authority  YET such is the condition of life that whatever is proposed it is much easier to find reasons for avoiding than embracing Marriage though a certain security from the reproach and solitude of antiquated virginity  has yet as it is usually conducted many disadvantages which take away much from the pleasure which society promises and which it might afford if pleasures and pains were honestly shared and mutual confidence inviolably preserved  THE miseries indeed which many ladies suffer under conjugal vexations are to be considered with great pity because their husbands are often not taken by them as objects of affection but forced upon them by authority and violence or by persuasion and importunity equally resistless when urged by those whom they have been always accustomed to reverence and obey and it very seldom appears that those who are thus despotick in the disposal of their children pay any regard to their domestick and personal felicity or think it so much to be enquired whether they will be happy as whether they will be rich  IT may be urged however in extenuation of this crime which parents not in any other respect to be numbered with robbers and assassins frequently commit that in their estimation riches and happiness are equivalent terms and that having passed their lives with  no other wish than that of adding acre to acre and filling one bag after another they imagine themselves to have sufficiently considered the advantage of a daughter when they have secured her a large jointure and given her reasonable expectations of living in the midst of those satisfactions with which she had seen her father and mother solacing their age  THERE is an oeconomical oracle received among the prudential and grave part of the world which advises fathers  to marry their daughters lest they should marry themselves  by which I suppose it is implied that women left to their own conduct generally unite themselves with such partners as can contribute very little to their felicity Who was the author of this maxim or with what intention it was originally uttered I have not yet discovered but imagine that however solemnly it may be transmitted or however implicitly received it can confer no authority which nature has denied it cannot license Titius to be unjust lest Caia should be imprudent nor give right to imprison for life lest liberty should be ill employed  THAT the ladies have sometimes incurred imputations which might naturally produce edicts not much in their favour must be confessed by their warmest advocates and I have indeed seldom observed that when the tenderness or virtue of their parents has preserved them from forced marriage and left them at large to chuse their own path in the labyrinth of life they have made any great advantage of their liberty for they have generally taken the opportunity of an independent fortune to trifle away their youth in the amusements of the town and lose their bloom in a hurry of diversions recurring in a succession too quick to leave room for any settled reflection they have grown old without growing wise have seen the world without gaining experience and at last have regulated their choice by motives trivial as those of a girl or mercenary as those of a miser  MELANTHIA came to town upon the death of her father with a very large fortune and with the reputation of a much larger she was therefore followed and caressed by many men of rank and by some of understanding but having an insatiable desire of pleasure she  was not at leisure from the park the gardens the theatres visits assemblies and masquerades to attend seriously to any proposal but was still impatient for a new flatterer and neglected marriage as always in her power till in time her admirers fell away some wearied with treating others disgusted with her folly and others offended by her inconstancy she heard of concerts to which she was not invited and was more than once forced to sit still at an assembly for want of a partner In this distress chance threw in her way Philotryphus a man vain glittering and thoughtless as herself who had spent a small fortune in equipage and dress and was shining in the last suit for which his taylor would give him credit He had been long endeavouring to retrieve his extravagance by marriage and therefore soon paid his court to Melanthia who after some weeks of insensibility at last saw him at a ball and was wholly overcome by his performance in a minuet They married but a man cannot always dance and Philotryphus had no other method of pleasing however as neither was in any great degree vitious they live together with no greater unhappiness than vacuity of mind and that tastelessness of life which proceeds from a satiety  of juvenile pleasures and an utter inability to fill their place by nobler and more suitable employments As they have known the fashionable world at the same time they agree in their notions of all those subjects on which they ever speak and being able to add nothing to the ideas of each other they are much inclined to conversation but very often join in one wish "That they could dream more and think less"  Argyris after having refused a thousand offers from men equal in rank and fortune at last consented to marry Cotylus the younger brother of a duke a man without elegance of mien beauty of person or force of understanding who while he courted her could not always forbear allusions to her birth and hints how cheaply she would purchase an alliance to so illustrious a family His conduct from the hour of his marriage has been insufferably tyrannical nor has he any other regard to her than what arises from his desire that her appearance may not disgrace him Upon this principle however he always orders that she should be gaily dressed and splendidly attended and she has among all her mortifications the happiness which she always desired of taking place of her elder sister  NUMB  SATURDAY  August    Nec dicet cur ego amicum  Offendam in nugis Hae nugae seria ducent  In mala derisum semel  HOR  IT has been very frequently remarked that authors are  genus irritabile  a  generation very easily put out of temper  and that they seldom fail of giving proofs of their irascibility upon the slightest attack of criticism or the most gentle or modest offer of advice and information  AS writers have generally been most acquainted with one another they have represented this character as chiefly prevailing among men of literature which a more extensive view of the world would have shewn them to be diffused through all human nature to mingle itself with every species of ambition and desire of praise and to discover its effects with greater or less restraint and under disguises more or less artful in every place and in every condition  THE quarrels of writers indeed are more observed because they necessarily appeal to the decision of the publick Their enmities are incited by applauses from their parties and prolonged by treacherous encouragement for general diversion and when the contest happens to rise high between men of genius and learning its memory is continued for the same reason as its vehemence was at first promoted because it gratifies the malevolence or curiosity of readers and relieves the vacancies of life with amusement and laughter The personal disputes therefore of rivals in wit are sometimes transmitted to posterity when the grudges and heartburnings of men less conspicuous though carried on with equal bitterness and productive of greater evils are exposed to the knowledge of those only whom they nearly affect and suffered to pass off and be forgotten among common and casual transactions  THE resentment which the discovery of a fault or folly produces must bear a certain proportion to our pride and will regularly be more acrimonious as pride is more immediately the principle of action In whatever  therefore we wish or imagine ourselves to excel we shall always be displeased to have our claims to reputation disputed and generally more displeased if the accomplishment be such as can expect reputation only for its reward For this reason it is common to find men break out into rage at any insinuations to the disadvantage of their wit who have born with great patience reflections on their morals and of women it has been always known that no censure wounds so deeply or rankles so long as that which charges them with want of beauty  AS men frequently fill their imaginations with trifling persuits and please themselves most with things of small importance I have often known very severe and lasting malevolence excited by unlucky censures which would have fallen without any effect had they not happened to wound a part remarkably tender Gustulus who valued himself upon the nicety of his palate disinherited his eldest son for telling him that the wine which he was then commending was the same which he had sent away the day before as not fit to be drunk Proculus withdrew his kindness from a nephew whom he had always considered as  the most promising genius of the age for happening to praise in his presence the graceful horsemanship of Marius And Fortunio when he was privy counsellor procured a clerk to be dismissed from one of the publick offices in which he was eminent for his skill and assiduity because he had been heard to say over a bottle that there was another man in the kingdom on whose skill at billiards he would lay his money against Fortunio's  FELICIA and Floretta had been bred up in one house and shared all the pleasures and endearments of infancy together They entered upon life at the same time and continued their confidence and friendship consulted each other in every change of their dress and every admission of a new lover thought every diversion more entertaining whenever it happened that both were present and when separate justified the conduct and celebrated the excellencies of one another Such was their intimacy and such their fidelity till a birthnight approached when Floretta took one morning an opportunity as they were consulting upon new cloaths to advise her friend not to dance at the ball and informed her that her performance the year before had not  answered the expectation which her other accomplishments had raised Felicia commended her sincerity and thanked her for the caution but told her that she danced to please herself and was in very little concern what the men might take the liberty of saying but that if her appearance gave her dear Floretta any uneasiness she would stay away Floretta had now nothing left but to make new protestations of sincerity and affection with which Felicia was so well satisfied that they parted with more than usual fondness They still continued to visit with this only difference that Felicia was more punctual than before and often declared how high a value she put upon sincerity how much she thought that goodness to be esteemed which would venture to admonish a friend of an error and with what gratitude advice was to be received even when it might happen to proceed from mistake  IN a few months Felicia with great seriousness told Floretta that though her beauty was such as gave charms to whatever she did and her qualifications so extensive that she could not fail of excellence in any attempt yet she thought herself obliged by the duties of  friendship to inform her that if ever she betrayed want of judgment it was by too frequent compliance with solicitations to sing for that her manner was somewhat ungraceful and her voice had no great compass It is true says Floretta when I sung three nights ago at lady Sprightly's I was hoarse with a cold but I sing for my own satisfaction and am not in the least pain whether I am liked However my dear Felicia's kindness is not the less and I shall always think myself happy in so true a friend  FROM this time they never saw each other without mutual professions of esteem and declarations of confidence but went soon after into the country to visit their relations When they came back they were prevailed on by the importunity of new acquaintance to take lodgings in different parts of the town and had frequent occasion when they met to bewail the distance at which they were placed and the uncertainty which each experienced of finding the other at home  THUS are the fondest and firmest friendships dissolved by such openness and sincerity as interrupt our enjoyment of our own  approbation or recalls us to the remembrance of those failings which we are more willing to indulge than to correct  IT is by no means necessary to imagine that he who is offended at advice was ignorant of the fault and resents the admonition as a false charge for perhaps it is most natural to be enraged when there is the strongest conviction of our own guilt While we can easily defend our character we are no more disturbed at an accusation than we are alarmed by an enemy whom we are sure to conquer and whose attack therefore will bring us honour without danger But when a man feels the reprehension of a friend seconded by his own heart he is easily heated into resentment and revenge either because he hoped that the fault of which he was conscious had escaped the notice of others or that his friend had looked upon it with tenderness and extenuation and excused it for the sake of his other virtues or had considered him as too wise to need advice or too delicate to be shocked with reproach or because we cannot feel without pain those reflections roused which we have been endeavouring to lay asleep and when pain has produced anger  who would not willingly believe that it ought to be discharged on others rather than on himself  THE resentment produced by sincerity whatever be its immediate cause is so certain and generally so keen that very few have magnanimity sufficient for the practice of a duty which above most others exposes its votaries to hardships and persecutions yet friendship without it is of a very little value since the great use of so close an intimacy is that our virtues may be guarded and encouraged and our vices repressed in their first appearance by timely detection and salutary remonstrances  IT is decreed by providence that nothing truly valuable shall be obtained in our present state but with difficulty and danger He that hopes for that pleasure which is to be gained by an unrestrained communication of sentiments must dare to hazard by unpleasing truths that regard which he aspires to merit The chief rule to be observed in the exercise of this dangerous office is to preserve it pure from all mixture of interest or vanity to forbear admonition or reproof when our consciences  tell us that they are incited not by the hopes of reforming faults but the desire of shewing our discernment or gratifying our own pride by the mortification of another It is not indeed certain that the most refined caution will find a proper time for bringing a man to the knowledge of his own failings or the most zealous benevolence reconcile him to that judgment by which they are detected but he who endeavours only the happiness of him whom he reproves will always have either the satisfaction of obtaining or deserving kindness if he succeeds he benefits his friend and if he fails he has at least the consciousness that he suffers for only doing well  NUMB  TUESDAY  August    Nulla recordanti lux est ingrata gravisque  Nulla suit eujus non meminisse velit  Ampliat aetatis spatium sibi vir bonus hoe est  Vivere bis vitâ posse priore srui  MART  SO few of the hours of life are filled up with objects adequate to the mind of man and so frequently are we in want of present  pleasure or employment that we are forced to have recourse every moment to the past and future for supplemental satisfactions and relieve the vacuities of our being by recollection of former passages or anticipation of events to come  I CANNOT but consider this necessity of searching on every side for matter on which the attention may be employed as a strong proof of the superior and celestial nature of the soul of man We have no reason to believe that other creatures have higher faculties or more extensive capacities than the preservation of themselves or of their species requires they seem always to be fully employed or to be completely at ease without employment to feel few intellectual miseries or pleasures and to have no exuberance of understanding to lay out upon curiosity or caprice but to have their minds exactly adapted to their bodies with few other ideas than such as corporal pain or pleasure impress upon them  OF memory which makes so large a part of the excellence of the human soul and which has so much influence upon all its other  powers but a small portion has been allotted to the animal world We do not find the grief with which the dams lament the loss of their young proportionate to the tenderness with which they caress the assiduity with which they feed or the vehemence with which they defend them Their regard for their offspring when it is before their eyes is not in appearance less than that of a human parent but when it is taken away it is very soon forgotten and after a short absence if brought again wholly disregarded  THAT they have very little remembrance of any thing once out of the reach of their senses and searce any power of comparing the present with the past and regulating their conclusions from experience may be gathered from this that their intellects are produced in their full perfection The sparrow that was hatched last spring makes her first nest the ensuing season of the same materials and with the same art as in any following year and the hen conducts and shelters her first brood of chickens with all the prudence that she ever attains  IT has been asked by men who love to perplex  any thing that is plain to common understandings how reason differs from instinct and Prior has with no great propriety made Solomon himself declare that to distinguish them is  the fool's ignorance    and the pedant's pride  To give an accurate answer to a question of which the terms are not compleatly understood is impossible we do not know in what either reason or instinct consist and therefore cannot tell with exactness how they differ but surely he that contemplates a ship and a bird's nest will not be long without finding out that the idea of the one was impressed at once and continued through all the progressive descents of the species without variation or improvement and that the other is the result of experiments compared with experiments has grown by accumulated observations from less to greater excellence and exhibits the collective knowledge of different ages and various professions  MEMORY is the purveyor of reason the power which places those images before the mind upon which the judgment is to be exercised and which treasures up the determination that are once passed as the rules of future action or grounds of subsequent conclusions  IT is indeed the faculty of remembrance which may be said to place us in the class of moral agents If we were to act only in consequence of some immediate impulse and receive no direction from internal motives of choice we should be pushed forward by an invincible fatality without power or reason for the most part to prefer one thing to another because we could make no comparison but of objects which might both happen to be present  WE owe to memory not only the increase of our knowledge and our progress in rational enquiries but many other intellectual pleasures Indeed almost all that we can be said to enjoy is past or future the present is in perpetual motion leaves us as soon as it arrives ceases to be present before its presence is well perceived and is only known to have existed by the effects which it leaves behind The greatest part of our ideas arises therefore from the view before or behind us and we are happy or miserable according as we are affected by the survey of our life or our prospect of future existence  WITH regard to futurity when events are at such a distance from us that we cannot take the whole concatenation into our view we have generally power enough over our imagination to turn it upon pleasing scenes and can promise ourselves riches honours and delights without intermingling those vexations and anxieties with which all human enjoyments are polluted If fear breaks in on one side and alarms us with dangers and disappointments we can call in hope on the other to solace us with rewards and escapes and victories so that we are seldom without means of palliating remote evils and can generally sooth ourselves to tranquillity whenever any troublesome presage happens to attack us  IT is therefore I believe much more common for the solitary and thoughtful to amuse themselves with schemes of the future than reviews of the past For the future is pliant and ductile and will be easily moulded by a strong fancy into any form But the images which memory presents are of a stubborn and untractable nature the objects of remembrance have already existed and left their signature  behind them impressed upon the mind so as to defy all attempts of rasure or of change  AS the satisfactions therefore arising from memory are less arbitrary they are more solid and are indeed the only joys which we can call our own Whatever we have once reposited as Dryden expresses it  in the sacred treasure of the past  is out of the reach of accident or violence nor can be lost either by our own weakness or another's malice  Non tamen irritum  Quodcunque retro est efficiet neque  Diffinget infectumque reddet  Quod sugiens semel hora vexit  THERE is certainly no greater happiness than to be able to look back on a life usefully and virtuously employed to trace our own progress in existence by such tokens as excite neither shame nor sorrow Life in which nothing has been done or suffered to distinguish one day from another is to him that has passed it as if it had never been except that he is conscious how ill he has husbanded the great deposit of his creator Life made memorable by crimes and diversified thro' its  several periods by wickedness is indeed easily reviewed but reviewed only with horror and remorse  THE great consideration which ought to influence us in the use of the present moment is to arise from the effect which as well or ill applied it must have upon the time to come for though its actual existence be inconceivably short yet its effects are unlimited and there is not the smallest point of time but may extend its consequences either to our hurt or our advantage through all eternity and give us reason to remember it for ever with anguish or exultation  THE time of life in which memory seems particularly to claim predominance over the other faculties of the mind is our declining age It has been remarked by former writers that old men are generally narrative and fall easily into recitals of past transactions and accounts of persons known to them in their youth When we approach the verge of the grave it is more eminently true  Vitae summa brevis spem nos vetat incloare longam  We have no longer any possibility of great vicissitudes  in our favour the changes which are to happen in the world will come too late for our accommodation and those who have no hope before them and to whom their present state is painful and irksome must of necessity turn their thoughts back to try what retrospect will afford It ought therefore to be the care of those who wish to pass the last hours with comfort to lay up such a treasure of pleasing ideas as shall support the expenses of that time which is to depend wholly upon the fund already acquired  Petite hine juvenesque senesque  Finem animo certum miserisque viatica canis  IN youth however unhappy we solace ourselves with the hope of better fortune and however vicious appease our consciences with intentions of repentance but the time comes at last in which life has no more to promise in which happiness can be drawn only from recollection and virtue will be all that we can recollect with pleasure  NUMB  SATURDAY  August    Mihi tarda fluunt ingrataque tempora  HOR  To the RAMBLER  Mr RAMBLER  I AM no great admirer of grave writings and therefore very frequently lay your papers aside before I have read them through yet I cannot but confess that by slow degrees you have raised my opinion of your understanding and that though I believe it will be long before I can be prevailed upon to regard you with much kindness you have however more of my esteem than those whom I sometimes make happy with opportunities to fill my teapot or pick up my fan I shall therefore chuse you for the confident of my distresses and ask your counsel with regard to the means of conquering or escaping them though I never expect from you any of that softness and pliancy which constitutes the perfection of a companion for the ladies as in the place where I now am I have recourse  to the mastiff for protection though I have no intention of making him a lapdog  MY mamma is a very fine lady who has more numerous and more frequent assemblies at her house than any other person in the same quarter of the town I was bred from my earliest infancy in a perpetual tumult of pleasure and remember to have heard of little else than messages visits playhouses and balls of the aukwardness of one woman and the coquetry of another the charming convenience of some rising fashion the difficulty of playing a new game the incidents of a masquerade and the dresses of a court night I knew before I was ten years old all the rules of paying and receiving visits and to how much civility every one of my acquaintance was entitled and was able to return with the proper degree of reserve or of vivacity the stated and established answer to every compliment so that I was very soon celebrated as a wit and a beauty and had heard before I was thirteen all that is ever said to a young lady My mother was generous to so uncommon a degree as to be pleased with my advance into life and allowed me without envy or reproof to enjoy the same happiness  with herself though most women about her own age were very angry to see young girls so forward and many fine gentlemen told her how cruel it was to throw new chains upon mankind and to tyrannize over them at the same time with her own charms and those of her daughter  I HAVE now lived two and twenty years and have passed of each year nine months in town and three at Richmond so that my time has been spent uniformly in the same company and the same amusements except as fashion has introduced new diversions or the revolutions of the gay world have afforded new successions of wits and beaus However my mother is so good an oeconomist of pleasure that I have no spare hours upon my hands for every morning brings some new appointment and every night is hurried away by the necessity of making our appearance at different places and of being with one lady at the opera and with another at the card table  WHEN the time came of settling our scheme of felicity for the summer it was detemined that I should pay a visit to a rich aunt  in a remote county As you know the chief conversation of all tea tables in the spring arises from a communication of the manner in which time is to be passed till winter it was a great relief to the barrenness of our topics to relate the pleasures that were in store for me to describe my uncle's seat with the park and gardens the charming walks and beautiful waterfalls and every one told me how much she envied me and what satisfaction she had once enjoyed in a situation of the same kind  AS we are all credulous in our own favour and willing to imagine some latent satisfaction in any thing which we have not experienced I will confess to you without restraint that I had suffered my head to be filled with expectations of some nameless pleasure in a rural life and that I hoped for the happy hour that should set me free from noise and flutter and ceremony dismiss me to the peaceful shade and lull me in content and tranquillity To solace myself under the misery of delay I sometimes heard a studious lady of my acquaintance read pastorals I was delighted with scarce any talk but of leaving the town  and never went to bed without dreaming of groves and meadows and frisking lambs  AT length I had all my cloaths in a trunk and saw the coach at the door I sprung in with ecstacy quarrelled with my maid for being too long in taking leave of the other servants and rejoiced as the ground grew less which lay between me and the completion of my wishes A few days brought me to a large old house encompassed on three sides with woody hills and looking from the front on a gentle river the sight of which renewed all my expectations of pleasure and gave me some regret for having lived so long without the enjoyment which these delightful scenes were now to afford me My aunt came out to receive me but in a dress so far removed from the present fashion that I could scarcely look upon her without laughter which would have been no kind requital for the trouble which she had taken to make herself fine against my arrival The night and the next morning were driven along with enquiries about our family my aunt then explained our pedigree and told me stories of my great grandfather's bravery in the civil  wars nor was it less than three days before I could persuade her to leave me to myself  AT last oeconomy prevailed she went in the usual manner about her own affairs and I was at liberty to range in the wilderness and sit by the cascade The novelty of the objects about me pleased me for a while but after a few days they were new no longer and I soon began to perceive that the country was not my element that shades and flowers and lawns and waters had very soon exhausted all their power of pleasing and that I had not in myself any fund of satisfaction with which I could supply the loss of my customary amusements  I UNHAPPILY told my aunt in the first warmth of our embraces that I had leave to stay with her ten weeks Six only are yet gone and how shall I live through the remaining four I go out and return I pluck a flower and throw it away I catch an insect and when I have examined its colours set it at liberty I fling a pebble into the water and see one circle spread after another When it chances to rain I walk in the great hall and watch the minutehand upon the dial  or play with a litter of kittens which the cat happens to have brought in a lucky time  MY aunt is afraid I shall grow melancholy and therefore encourages the neighbouring gentry to visit us They came at first with great eagerness to see the fine lady from London but when we meet we had no common to pick on which we could converse they had no curiosity after plays operas or musick and I find as little satisfaction from their accounts of the quarrels or alliances of families whose names when once I can escape I shall never hear The women have now seen me know how my gown is made and are satisfied the men are generally afraid of me and say little because they think themselves not at liberty to talk rudely  THUS am I condemned to solitude the day moves slowly forward and I see the dawn with uneasiness because I consider the night is at a great distance I have tried to sleep by a brook but find its murmurs ineffectual so that I am forced to be awake at least twelve hours without visits without cards without laughter and without flattery I walk because I am disgusted with sitting still and sit  down because I am weary with walking I have no motive to action nor any object of love or hate or fear or inclination I cannot dress with spirit for I have neither rival nor admirer I cannot dance without a partner nor be kind or cruel without a lover  SUCH is the life of Euphelia and such it is likely to continue for a month to come I have not yet declared against existence nor called upon the destinies to cut my thread but I have sincerely resolved not to condemn myself to such another summer nor too hastily to flatter myself with happiness Yet I have heard Mr Rambler of those who never thought themselves so much at ease as in solitude and cannot but suspect it to be some way or other my own fault that without great pain either of mind or body I am thus weary of myself that the current of youth stagnates and that I am languishing in a dead calm for want of some external impulse I shall therefore think you a benefactor to our sex if you will teach me the art of living alone for I am confident that a thousand and a thousand and a thousand ladies who affect to talk with ecstacies of the pleasures of the country are in reality like me longing  for the winter and wishing to be delivered from themselves by company and diversion  I am SIR Yours EUPHELIA  NUMB  TUESDAY  August    Flumine perpetuo torrens solet acrius ire  Sed tamen haec brevis est illa perennis aqua  OVID  IT is observed by those who have written on the constitution of the human body and the original of those diseases by which it is afflicted that every man comes into the world morbid that there is no temperature so exactly regulated but that some humour is fatally predominant and that we are generally impregnated in our first entrance upon life with the seeds of that malady which in time shall bring us to the grave  THIS remark has been extended by others to the intellectual faculties Some that imagine themselves to have looked with more than common penetration into human nature have  endeavoured to persuade us that each man is born with a mind formed peculiarly for certain purposes and with desires unalterably determined to particular objects from which the attention cannot be long diverted and which alone as they are well or ill persued must produce the praise or blame the happiness or misery of his future life  THIS position has not indeed been hitherto proved with strength proportionate to the assurance with which it has been advanced and perhaps will never gain much prevalence by a close examination  IF the doctrine of innate ideas be itself disputable there seems to be little hope of establishing an opinion which supposes that even complications of ideas have been given us at our birth and that we are made by nature ambitious or covetous before we know the meaning of either power or money  YET as every step in the progression of existence changes our position with respect to the things about us so as to lay us open to new assaults and particular dangers and subjects us to inconveniences from which any other situation  is exempt as a publick or a private life youth and age wealth and poverty have all some evil closely adherent which cannot wholly be escaped but by quitting the state to which it is annexed and submitting to the incumbrances of some other condition so it cannot be denied that every difference in the structure of the mind has its advantages and its wants and that failures and defects being inseparable from humanity however the powers of understanding be extended or contracted there will on one side or the other always be an avenue to error and miscarriage  There seem to be some souls suited to great and others to little employments some formed to soar aloft and take in wide views and others to grovel on the ground and confine their regard to a narrow sphere Of these the one is always in danger of becoming useless by a daring negligence the other by a scrupulous solicitude the one collects many ideas but confused and indistinct the other is busied in minute accuracy but without compass and without dignity  THE general error of those who possess powerful and elevated understandings is that  they form schemes of too great extent and flatter themselves too hastily with success they feel their own force to be great and by the complacency with which every man surveys himself imagine it still greater they therefore look out for undertakings worthy of their abilities and engage in them with very little precaution for they imagine that every obstruction will give way and that without any premeditated measures they shall be able to find expedients in all difficulties They are naturally apt to consider all prudential maxims as below their regard to treat with contempt those securities and resources which others know themselves obliged to provide and disdain to accomplish their purposes by established means and common gradations  THIS precipitation which is incited by the pride of intellectual superiority is very often fatal to great designs The strength and resolution of the combat are seldom equal to the vehemence of the charge He that meets with an opposit on which he did not expect very quickly loses his courage and too soon considers the enterprise as desperate only because he had before concluded it easy The violence of his first onset is succeeded by a  lasting and unconquerable languor the miscarriage seizes his faculties his conviction of the unreasonable confidence with which he had flattered his own desires makes him fearful of giving way to new hopes the contemplation of an attempt in which he has so far fallen below the expectations which he had indulged is always painful and vexatious he therefore naturally turns his attention to more pleasing objects and habituates his imagination to other entertainments till by slow degrees he quits his first persuit and suffers some other project to take possession of his thoughts in which the same ardour of mind promises him again certain success and which disappointments of the same kind compel him to abandon  THUS too much vigour in the beginning of an undertaking often intercepts and prevents the steadiness and perseverance always necessary in the conduct of any complicated scheme where many interests are to be connected many movements to be adjusted and the joint effort of distinct and independent powers to be directed to a single point In all important events which have been suddenly brought to pass chance has been the agent rather than  reason and therefore however those who seemed to preside in the transaction may have been celebrated by such as loved or feared them succeeding times have commonly considered them as fortunate rather than prudent Every design in which the connexion is regularly traced from the first motion to the last must be formed and executed by calm intrepidity and requires not only courage which danger cannot turn aside but constancy which fatigues cannot weary and contrivance which impediments cannot exhaust  ALL the performances of human art at which we look with praise or wonder are instances of the resistless force of perseverance it is by this that the quarry becomes a pyramid and that distant countries are united with canals If a man was to compare the effect of a single stroke of the pickax or of one impression of the spade with the general design and last consequence he would be overwhelmed by the sense of their disproportion yet those petty operations incessantly continued in time surmount the greatest difficulties and mountains are levelled and oceans bounded by the slender force of human beings  IT is therefore of the utmost importance that those who have any intention of deviating from the beaten roads of life and acquiring a reputation superior to the common names which are hourly sinking into oblivion and swept away by time among the refuse of fame should add to their reason and their spirit the power of persisting in their purposes acquire the art of sapping what they cannot batter and the habit of vanquishing obstinate resistance by obstinate attacks  THE student who would build his knowledge on solid foundations and proceed by just degrees to the pinacles of truth is directed by the great philosopher of France to begin by doubting of his own existence In like manner whoever would complete any arduous and intricate enterprise should as soon as his imagination can cool after the first blaze of hope place before his own eyes every possible embarrasment that may retard or defeat him He should first question the probability of success and then endeavour to remove the objections that he has raised It is proper says old Markham to exercise your horse on the more inconvenient side of the course that if  he should in the race be forced upon it he may not be discouraged and Horace advises his poetical friend to consider every day as the last which he shall enjoy because that will always give pleasure which we receive beyond our hopes If we alarm ourselves beforehand with more difficulties than we really find we shall be animated by unexpected facility with double spirit and if we find our cautions and fears justified by the consequence there will however happen nothing against which provision has not been made no sudden shock will be received nor will the main scheme be disconcerted  THERE is indeed some danger lest he that too scrupulously balances probabilities and too perspicaciously foresees obstacles should remain always in a state of inaction without venturing upon attempts on which he will think it not unlikely that he may spend his labour without advantage But previous despondence is not the fault of those for whom this essay is designed they who require to be warned against precipitation will not suffer more fear to intrude into their contemplations than is necessary to allay the effervescence of an agitated fancy As  Des Cartes  has kindly  shewn how a manmay prove to himself his own existence if once he can be prevailed upon to question it so the ardent and adventurous will not be long without finding some plausible extenuation of the greatest difficulties and indeed such is the uncertainty of all human affairs that security and despair are equal follies and as it is presumption and arrogance to anticipate triumphs it is weakness and cowardice to prognosticate miscarriages The numbers that have been stopped in their career of happiness are sufficient to shew the uncertainty of human foresight but there are not wanting contrary instances of such success obtained against all appearances as may warrant the boldest flights of genius if they are supported by unshaken perseverance  NUMB  SATURDAY  August    HOMER  To the RAMBLER  SIR  I Had lately a very remarkable dream which made so strong an impression on me that I remember it every word and if you are not better employed you may read the relation of it as follows  METHOUGHT I was in the midst of a very entertaining set of company and extremely delighted in attending to a lively conversation when on a sudden I perceived one of the most shocking figures imagination can frame advancing towards me She was drest in black her skin was contracted into a thousand wrinkles her eyes deep sunk in her head and her complexion pale and livid as the countenance of death Her looks were filled with terror and unrelenting severity and her hands armed with whips and scorpions As soon as she came near with a horrid frown and a voice that chilled my very blood she bid me follow  her I obeyed and she led me through rugged paths beset with briars and thorns into a deep solitary valley Wherever she passed the fading verdure withered beneath her steps her pestilential breath infected the air with malignant vapours obscured the lustre of the sun and involved the fair face of heaven in universal gloom Dismal howlings resounded through the forest from every baleful tree the nightraven uttered his dreadful note and the prospect was filled with desolation and horror In the midst of this tremendous scene my execrable guide addressed me in the following manner  "RETIRE with me O rash unthinking mortal from the vain allurements of a deceitful world and learn that pleasure was not designed the portion of human life Man was born to mourn and to be wretched this is the condition of all below the stars and whoever endeavours to oppose it acts in contradiction to the will of heaven Fly then from the fatal enchantments of youth and social delight and here consecrate thy solitary hours to lamentation and woe Misery is the duty of all sublunary beings and every enjoyment is an offence  to the deity who is to be worshipped only by the mortification of every sense of pleasure and the everlasting exercise of sighs and tears"  THIS melancholy picture of life quite sunk my spirits and seemed to annihilate every principle of joy within me I threw myself beneath a blasted yeugh where the winds blew cold and dismal round my head and dreadful apprehensions chilled my heart Here I resolved to lie till the hand of death which I impatiently invoked should put an end to the miseries of a life so deplorably wretched In this sad situation I spied on one hand of me a deep muddy river whose heavy waves rolled on in flow sullen murmurs Here I determined to plunge and was just upon the brink when I found myself suddenly drawn back I turned about and was surprised by the sight of the loveliest object I had ever beheld The most engaging charms of youth and beauty appeared in all her form effulgent glories sparkled in her eyes and their awful splendours were softened by the gentlest looks of compassion and peace At her approach the frightful spectre who had before tormented me vanished away and with her all the horrors  she had caused The gloomy clouds brightened into chearful sunshine the groves recovered their verdure and the whole region looked gay and blooming as the garden of Eden I was quite transported at this unexpected change and reviving pleasure began to glad my thoughts when with a look of inexpressible sweetness my beauteous deliverer thus uttered her divine instructions  "My name is RELIGION I am the offspring of TRUTH and LOVE and the parent of BENEVOLENCE HOPE and JOY That monster from whose power I have freed you is called SUPERSTITION she is the child of DISCONTENT and her followers are FEAR and SORROW Thus different as we are she has often the insolence to assume my name and character and seduces unhappy mortals to think us the same till she at length drives them to the borders of DESPAIR that dreadful abyss into which you were just going to sink"  "LOOK round and survey the various beauties of this globe which heaven has destined for the seat of human race and consider whether a world thus exquisitely  framed could be meant for the abode of misery and pain For what end has the lavish hand of providence diffused such innumerable objects of delight but that all might rejoice in the privilege of existence and be filled with gratitude to the beneficent author of it Thus to enjoy the blessings he has sent is virtue and obedience and to reject them merely as means of pleasure is pitiable ignorance or absurd perverseness Infinite goodness is the source of created existence the proper tendency of every rational being from the highest order of raptured seraphs to the meanest rank of men is to rise incessantly from lower degrees of happiness to higher They have each faculties assigned them for various orders of delights"  "WHAT cried I is this the language of RELIGION Does she lead her votaries through flowery paths and bid them pass an unlaborious life Where are the painful toils of virtue the mortifications of penitents the selfdenying exercises of saints and heroes"  "THE true enjoyments of a reasonable  being" answered she mildly "do not consist in unbounded indulgence or luxurious ease in the tumult of passions the languor of indolence or the flutter of light amusements Yielding to immoral pleasure corrupts the mind living to animal and trifling ones debases it both in their degree disqualify it for its genuine good and consign it over to wretchedness Whoever would be really happy must make the diligent and regular exercise of his superior powers his chief attention adoring the perfections of his maker expressing goodwill to his fellow creatures cultivating inward rectitude To his lower faculties he must allow such gratifications as will by refreshing him invigorate his nobler persuits In the regions inhabited by angelic natures unmingled felicity for ever blooms joy flows there with a perpetual and abundant stream nor needs there any mound to check its course Beings conscious of a frame of mind originally diseased as all the human race has cause to be must use the regimen of a stricter selfgovernment Whoever has been guilty of voluntary excesses must patiently submit both to the painful workings of nature  and needful severities of medicine in order to his cure Still he is intitled to a moderate share of whatever alleviating accommodations this fair mansion of his merciful parent affords consistent with his recovery And in proportion as this recovery advances the liveliest joy will spring from his secret sense of an amended and improving heartSo far from the horrors of despair is the condition even of the guiltyShudder poor mortal at the thought of that gulph into which thou wast but now going to plunge"  "WHILE the most faulty have every encouragement to amend the more innocent soul will be supported with still sweeter consolations under all its experience of human infirmities supported by the gladdening assurances that every sincere endeavour to outgrow them shall be assisted accepted and rewarded To such a one the lowliest selfabasement is but a deeplaid foundation for the most elevated hopes since they who faithfully examine and acknowledge what they are shall be enabled under my conduct to become what they desire The christian and the heroe are inseparable and to the aspirings of unassuming trust  and filial confidence are set no bounds To him who is animated with a view of obtaining approbation from the sovereign of the universe no difficulty is insurmountable Secure in this persuit of every needful aid his conflict with the severest pains and trials is little more than the vigorous exercises of a mind in health His patient dependence on that providence which looks through all eternity his silent resignation his ready accommodation of his thoughts and behaviour to its inscrutable ways is at once the most excellent sort of selfdenial and a source of the most exalted transports Society is the true sphere of human virtue In social active life difficulties will perpetually be met with restraints of many kinds will be necessary and studying to behave right in respect of these is a discipline of the human heart useful to others and improving to itself Suffering is no duty but where it is necessary to avoid guilt or to do good nor pleasure a crime but where it strengthens the influence of bad inclinations or lessens the generous activity of virtue The happiness allotted to man in his present state is indeed faint and low compared with his immortal prospects and  noble capacities but yet whatever portion of it the distributing hand of heaven offers to each individual is a needful support and refreshment for the present moment so far as it may not hinder the attaining his final destination"  "RETURN then with me from continual misery to moderate enjoyment and grateful alacrity Return from the contracted views of solitude to the proper duties of a relative and dependent being Religion is not confined to cells and closets nor restrained to sullen retirement These are the gloomy doctrines of SUPERSTITION by which she endeavours to break those chains of benevolence and social affection that link the welfare of every particular with that of the whole Remember that the greatest honour you can pay to the author of your being is by such a chearful behaviour as discovers a mind satisfied with his dispensations"  HERE my preceptress paused and I was going to express my acknowledgments for her discourse when a ring of bells from the neighbouring village and a newrisen sun  darting his beams through my windows awaked me  I am Yours c  NUMB  TUESDAY  August    EURIP  To the RAMBLER  SIR  THOUGH in the dissertations which you have given us on marriage very just cautions are laid down against the common causes of infelicity and the necessity of having in that important choice the first regard to virtue is carefully inculcated yet I cannot think the subject so much exhausted but that a little reflection would present to the mind many questions in the discussion of which great numbers are interested and many precepts which deserve to be more particularly and forcibly impressed  YOU seem like most of the writers that have gone before you to have allowed as an uncontested principle that  Marriage is generally unhappy  but I know not whether a man who professes to think for himself and draws his opinions from his own observations does not depart from his character when he follows the croud thus implicitly and receives maxims without recalling them to a new examination especially when they comprise so wide a circuit of life and include such variety of circumstances As I have an equal right with others to give my opinion of the objects about me and a better title to determine concerning that state which I have tried than many who talk of it without experience I am unwilling to be restrained by mere authority from advancing what I believe an accurate view of the world will confirm that marriage is not commonly unhappy otherwise than as life is unhappy and that most of those who complain of connubial miseries have as much satisfaction as their nature would have admitted or their conduct procured in any other condition  IT is indeed common to hear both sexes  repine at their condition relate the happiness of their earlier years blame the folly and rashness of their own choice and warn those whom they see coming into the world against the same precipitance and infatuation But it is to be remembred that the days which they so much wish to call back are the days not only of celibacy but of youth the days of novelty and improvement of ardour and of hope of health and vigour of body of gayety and lightness of heart It is not easy to unite life with any circumstances in which youth will not be delightful and I am afraid that whether married or unmarried we shall find the vesture of terrestrial existence more heavy and cumbrous the longer it is worn  THAT both censure themselves for the indiscretion of their choice is not a sufficient proof that they have chosen ill since we see the same discontent at every other part of life which we cannot change Converse with almost any man grown old in a profession and you will find him regretting that he did not enter into some different course to which he too late finds his genius better adapted or in which he discovers that wealth and honour are more easily attained  The merchant says Horace envies the soldier and the soldier recounts the felicity of the merchant the lawyer when his clients harrass him calls out for the quiet of the countryman and the countryman when business calls him to town proclaims that there is no happiness but amidst opulence and crouds Every man recounts the inconveniencies of his own station and always thinks those of any other less because he has not felt them Thus the married praise the ease and freedom of a single state and the single fly to marriage from the weariness of solitude From all our observations we may collect with certainty that misery is the lot of man but cannot discover in what particular condition it will find most alleviations or whether all external appendages are not as we use them well or ill the causes either of pain or pleasure  WHOEVER feels great pain naturally hopes for ease from change of posture he changes it and finds himself equally tormented and of the same kind are the expedients by which we endeavour to obviate or elude those uneasinesses to which mortality will always be subject It is not likely that the married state is eminently miserable since we see such  numbers whom the death of their partners has set free from it entering it again  WIVES and husbands are indeed incessantly complaining of each other and there would be reason for imagining that almost every house was infested with perverseness or oppression beyond human sufferance did we not know upon how small occasions some minds burst out into lamentations and reproaches and how naturally every animal revenges his pain upon those who happen to be near without any nice examination of its cause We are always willing to fancy ourselves within a little of happiness and when with repeated efforts we cannot reach it persuade ourselves that it is intercepted by an illpaired mate since if we could find any other obstacle it would be our own fault that it was not removed  ANATOMISTS have often remarked that though our diseases are sufficiently numerous and severe yet when we enquire into the structure of the body the tenderness of some parts the minuteness of others and the immense multiplicity of animal functions that must concur to the healthful and vigorous exercise  of all our powers there appears reason to wonder rather that we are preserved so long than that we perish so soon and that our frame subsists for a single day or hour without disorder rather than that it should be broken or obstructed by violence of accidents or length of time  THE same reflection arises in my mind upon observation of the manner in which marriage is frequently contracted When I see the avaricious and crafty taking companions to their tables and their beds without any enquiry but after farms and money or the giddy and thoughtless uniting themselves for life to those whom they have only seen by the light of tapers at a ball when parents make articles for their children without enquiring after their consent when some marry for heirs to disappoint their brothers and others throw themselves into the arms of those whom they do not love because they have found themselves rejected where they were more solicitous to please when some marry because their servants cheat them some because they squander their own money some because their houses are pestered with company some because they will live like other people  and some only because they are sick of themselves I am not so much inclined to wonder that marriage is sometimes unhappy as that it appears generally so little loaded with calamity and cannot but conclude that society has something in itself eminently agreable to human nature when I find its pleasures so great that even the ill choice of a companion can hardly overbalance them  BY the antient custom of the Muscovites the men and women never saw each other till they were joined beyond the power of parting It may be suspected that by this method many unsuitable matches were produced and many tempers associated that were very little qualified to give pleasure to each other Yet perhaps among a people so little delicate where the paucity of gratifications and the uniformity of life gave no opportunity for imagination to interpose its objections there was not much danger of capricious dislike and while they felt neither cold nor hunger they might live quietly together without any thought of the defects of one another  AMONGST us whom knowledge has made Mice and affluence wanton there are indeed  more cautions requisite to secure tranquillity and yet if we observe the manner in which those converse who have singled out each other for marriage we shall perhaps not think that the Russians lost much by their restraint For the whole endeavour of both parties during the time of courtship is to hinder themselves from being known and to disguise their natural temper and real desires in hypocritical imitation studied compliance and continued affection From the time that their love is avowed neither sees the other but in a mask and the cheat is managed often on both sides with so much art and discovered afterwards with so much abruptness that each has reason to suspect that some transformation has happened on the weddingnight and that by a strange imposture one has been courted and another married  I DESIRE you therefore Mr RAMBLER to question all who shall hereafter come to you with matrimonial complaints concerning their behaviour in the time of courtship and inform them that they are neither to wonder nor repine when a contract begun with fraud has ended in disappointment  I am c  NUMB  SATURDAY  August    Genus et proavos et quae non fecimus ipsi  Vix ea nostra voco  OVID  To the RAMBLER  SIR  SINCE I find that you have paid so much regard to my complaints as to publish them I am inclined by vanity or gratitude to continue our correspondence and indeed without either of these motives I am at present glad of an opportunity to write for I am not much accustomed to keep in any thing that swells my heart and have here none with whom I can very freely converse and while I am thus employed some of those tedious hours which I have condemned myself to pass in this place will slip away When I return to my usual amusement of watching the clock I shall find that I have disburdened myself of part of the day and that the time of my return from exile is less remote  YOU perceive that I do not pretend to claim any great merit from my regard to your performances or to write with much consideration of any thing but my own convenience and not to conceal from you my real sentiments the little time which I have here spent against my will in solitary meditation has not much contributed to my veneration for authors I have now sufficient reason to suspect that with all your splendid professions of wisdom and seeming regard for truth and virtue you have very little sincerity that you either write what you do not think and willingly impose upon mankind or that you take no care to think right but while you set up yourself as a guide in the labyrinth of life mislead your followers by credulity or negligence that you take the liberty of producing to the publick whatever notions you can speciously maintain or elegantly express without enquiring whether they are just and that you are apt to think yourself qualified by books to treat on subjects which are only to be understood by observation and experience and transcribe hereditary falshoods from old authors perhaps as ignorant and careless as yourself  YOU may perhaps wonder that I express myself with so much acrimony on a question in which women are supposed to have very little interest and you are likely enough for I have seen many instances of the sauciness of scholars to tell me that I am more properly employed in playing with my kittens than in giving myself airs of criticism and censuring the learned But you are mistaken if you imagine that I am to be intimidated by your contempt or silenced by your reproofs As I read I have a right to judge as I am injured I have a right to complain and these privileges which I have purchased at so dear a rate I shall not easily be persuaded to resign  TO read has indeed never been my business but as there are hours of leisure in the most active life I have passed the superfluities of time which the diversions of the town left upon my hands in turning over a large collection of tragedies and romances which chance threw early in my way where amongst other sentiments common to all authors of this class I have found almost every page filled with the charms and happiness of a country life that life to which every statesman  in the highestelevation of his prosperity is contriving to retire that life to which every tragick heroine in some scene or other wishes to have been born and which is always represented as a certain refuge from folly and anxiety from passion and from guilt  IT was impossible to read so many passionate exclamations and soothing descriptions without feeling some desire to enjoy the state in which all this felicity was to be enjoyed and therefore I received with raptures the invitation of my good aunt and expected that by some unknown influence I should find all hopes and fears all jealousies and competitions vanish from my heart upon my first arrival at the seats of innocence and tranquillity that I should sleep in halcyon bowers and wander in elysian gardens where I should meet with nothing but the softness of benevolence the candour of simplicity and the chearfulness of content where I should see reason exerting her sovereignty over life without any interruption from envy avarice or ambition and every day passing in such a manner as the severest wisdom should approve  THIS Mr RAMBLER I tell you I expected  and this I had by an hundred authors been taught to expect By this expectation I was led hither and here I live in a state of perpetual uneasiness without any other comfort than that of hoping to return to London Having since I wrote my former letter been driven by the mere necessity of escaping from absolute inactivity to make myself more acquainted with the affairs and inhabitants of this place I am now no longer an absolute stranger to rural conversation and employments but am very far from discovering in them more innocence or wisdom than in the sentiments or conduct of those with whom I have passed more chearful and more fashionable hours  IT is common to reproach the teatable and the park with giving opportunities and encouragement to scandal I cannot indeed wholly clear them from the charge but must however observe in favour of the modish prattlers that if not by principle we are at least by accident less guilty of defamation than the country ladies For having greater numbers to observe and censure we are commonly content to charge them only with their own faults or follies and seldom give way to malevolence  but such as arises from some injury or affront real or imaginary offered to ourselves But in these distant provinces where the same families inhabit the same houses from age to age they transmit and recount the faults of a whole succession I have been informed how every estate in the neighbourhood was originally got and find if I may credit the accounts given me that there is not a single acre in the hands of the right owner I have been told of intrigues between beaus and toasts that have been now three centuries in their quiet graves and am often entertained with traditionary scandal on persons of whose names there would have been no remembrance had they not committed somewhat that might disgrace their descendents  IN one of my visits I happened to commend the air and dignity of a young lady who had just left the company upon which two grave matrons looked with great sliness at each other and then the older of them asked whether I had ever seen the picture of Henry the eighth You may imagine that I did not immediately perceive the propriety of the question but after having waited a while for information I was told that the lady's grandmother had a  great great grandmother that was maid of honour to Anna Bullen and supposed to have been too great a favourite of the king  IF once there happens a quarrel between the principal persons of two families the malignity is continued without end and it is common for two old maids to fall out about some election in which their grandfathers were competitors the heartburnings of the civil war are not yet extinguished there are two families in the neighbourhood who have destroyed each others game from the time of Philip and Mary and when an account came of an inundation which had injured the plantations of a worthy gentleman one of the hearers remarked with exultation that he might now have some notion of the ravages committed by his ancestors in their retreat from Bosworth  THUS malice and hatred descend here with an inheritance and it is necessary to be well versed in history that the various factions of this county may be understood You cannot expect to be on good terms with two families who are resolved to love nothing in common and in selecting your intimates you are perhaps  to consider which party you most favour in the barons wars I have often lost the good opinion of my aunt's visitants by confounding the interests of York and Lancaster and was once censured for sitting silent when William Rufus was called a tyrant I have however now thrown aside all pretences to circumspection for I find it impossible in less than seven years to learn all the requisite cautions At London if you know your company and their parents you are safe but you are here suspected of alluding to the slips of great grandmothers and of reviving contests which were decided in armour by the redoubted knights of ancient times I hope therefore that you will not condemn my impatience if I am weary of attending where nothing can be learned and of quarrelling where there is nothing to contest and that you will contribute to divert me while I stay here by some facetious performance  I am SIR EUPHELIA  NUMB  TUESDAY  August    Quanquam his solatiis acquiescam debilitor frangor eadem illa humanitate quae me ut hoc ipsum permitterem induxit non ideo tamen velim durior fieri nec ignoro alios hujusmodi casus nihil amplius vocare quam damnum eoque sibi magnos homines sapientes videri Qui an magni sapientesque sint nescio homines non sunt Hominis est enim affici dolore sentire resistere tamen solatia admittere non solatiis non egere  PLIN  OF the passions with which the mind of man is agitated it may be observed that they naturally hasten towards their own extinction by inciting and quickening the attainment of their objects Thus fear urges our flight and desire animates our progress and if there are some which perhaps may be indulged till they outgrow the good appropriated to their satisfaction as is frequently observed of avarice and ambition yet their immediate tendency is to some means of happiness really existing and generally within the prospect The miser always imagines that  there is a cer ain sum that will fill his heart to the brim and the ambitious man like king Pyrrhus has an acquisition in his thoughts that is to terminate his labours after which he shall pass the rest of his life in ease or gayety in repose or devotion  SORROW is perhaps the only affection of the breast that can be excepted from this general remark and it therefore deserves the particular attention of those who have assumed the arduous province of preserving the balance of our mental constitution and of administering physick to the soul The other passions are diseases indeed but they necessarily direct us to their proper cure A man at once feels the pain and knows the medicine to which he is carried with greater haste as the evil which requires it is more excruciating and cures himself by unerring instinct as the wounded stags of Crete are related by Aelian to have recourse to vulnerary herbs But for sorrow there is no remedy provided by nature it is often occasioned by accidents irreparable and dwells upon objects that have lost or changed their existence it requires what it cannot hope that the laws of nature should be repealed  that the dead should return or the past should be recalled  SORROW is not that regret for negligence or error which may animate us to future care or activity or that repentance of crimes for which however irrevocable our creator has promised to accept it as an attonement the pain which arises from these causes has very salutary effects and is every hour extenuating itself by the reparation of those miscarriages that produce it Sorrow is properly that state of the mind in which our desires are fixed upon the past without looking forward to the future an incessant wish that something were otherwise than it has been a tormenting and harassing want of some enjoyment or possession which we have lost and which no endeavours can possibly regain Into such anguish many have sunk upon some sudden diminution of their fortune an unexpected blast of their reputation or the loss of children or friends They have suffered all sensibility of pleasure to be destroyed by a single blow have given up for ever the hopes of substituting any other object in the room of that which they lament have resigned the remaining part of their lives to gloom and solitude complaints  and despondency worn themselves out in unavailing misery and sunk down at last under their burthen  YET so much is this passion the natural consequence of tenderness and endearment that however painful and however useless it is justly reproachful not to feel it on some occasions and so widely and constantly has it always prevailed that the laws of some nations and the customs of others have limited a time for the external appearances of grief caused by the dissolution of close alliances and the breach of domestic union  IT seems determined by the general suffrage of mankind that sorrow is to a certain point laudable as the offspring of love or at least pardonable as the effect of weakness but that it ought not to be suffered to increase by indulgence but must give way after a stated time to social duties and the common avocations of life It is at first unavoidable and therefore must be allowed whether with or without our choice it may afterwards be admitted as a decent and affectionate testimony of kindness and esteem something will be extorted by nature and something may be given  to the world But all beyond the bursts of passion or the forms of solemnity is not only useless but culpable for we have no righ to sacrifice to the vain longings of affection that time which providence allows us for the task of our station  YET it too often happens that sorrow thus lawfully entering gains such a firm possession of the mind that it is not afterwards to be ejected the mournful ideas first violently impressed and afterwards willingly received so much engross the attention as to predominate in every meditation to intrude uncalled to darken gayety and perplex ratiocination An habitual sadness then seizes upon the soul and the faculties are chained to a single object which can never be contemplated but with hopeless uneasiness  This is a state of dejection from which it is often very difficult to rise to chearfulness and alacrity and therefore many who have laid down speculative rules of mental health think preservatives easier than remedies and teach us not to trust ourselves with favourite enjoyments not to indulge the luxury of fondness  but to keep our minds always suspended in such a state of indifference that we may change any of the objects about us without inconvenience or emotion  AN exact compliance with this rule might perhaps contribute to tranquillity but surely it would never produce happiness He that regards none so much as to be afraid of losing them must live for ever without the gentle pleasures of sympathy and confidence he must feel no melting fondness no warmth of benevolence nor any of those honest joys which nature annexes to the power of pleasing And as no man can justly claim more tenderness than he pays he must forfeit his share in all that officious and watchful kindness which love only can dictate and all those lenient endearments by which love only can soften life He may justly be overlooked and neglected by such as have more warmth in their heart for who would be the friend of him whom with whatever assiduity he may be courted and with whatever services obliged his principles will not suffer to make equal returns and who when you have exhausted all the instances of good will can only be prevailed on not to be an enemy  AN attempt to preserve life in a state of neutrality and indifference is unreasonable and vain If by excluding joy we could shut out grief the scheme would deserve very serious attention but since however we may debar ourselves from happiness misery will find its way at many inlets and the assaults of pain will force our regards though we may withhold it from the invitations of pleasure we may surely endeavour to raise life above the middle point of apathy at one time since it will necessarily sink below it at another  BUT though it cannot be reasonable not to gain happiness for fear of losing it yet it must be confessed that in proportion to the pleasure of possession will be for some time our sorrow for the loss but it is the province of the moralist to enquire whether such pains may not quickly give way to mitigation Some have thought that the most certain way to clear the heart from its embarrassment is to drag it by force into scenes of merriment Others imagine that such a transition is too violent and recommend rather to sooth it into tranquillity by making it acquainted with miseries more dreadful and afflictive and diverting to the calamities of others the regard  which we are inclined to fix too closely upon our own misfortunes  IT may be doubted whether either of those remedies will be sufficiently powerful The efficacy of mirth it is not always easy to try and the indulgence of melancholy may be suspected to be one of those medicines which will destroy if it happens not to cure  THE safe and general antidote against sorrow is employment It is commonly observed that among soldiers and seamen though there is much kindness there is little grief they see their friend fall without any of that lamentation which is indulged in security and idleness because they have no leisure to spare from the care of themselves and whoever shall keep his thoughts equally busy will find himself equally unaffected with irretrievable losses  TIME is observed generally to wear out sorrow and its effects might doubtless be accelerated by quickening the succession and enlarging the variety of objects  Si tempore longo  Leniri poterit luctus tu sperne morari  Qui sapiet sibi tempus erit  GROTIUS  SORROW is a kind of rust of the soul which every new idea contributes in its passage to scour away It is the putrefaction of stagnant life and is remedied by exercise and motion  NUMB  SATURDAY  Sept    Non est vivere sed valere vita  MART  AMONG the innumerable follies by which we lay up in our youth repentance and remorse for the succeeding part of our lives there is scarce any thing against which warnings are of less efficacy than the neglect of health When the springs of motion are in their full strength when the heart bounds with vigour and the eye sparkles with spirit it is with difficulty that we are taught to conceive the imbecillity and tenderness that every hour is bringing upon us or to imagine that the nerves which are now braced with so much strength and the limbs which play with so much activity will lose all their power under the gripe of time relax with numbness and totter with debility  AMONG the arguments which have been used against complaints under the miseries of life the philosophers have I think forgot to mention the incredulity of those to whom we tell our sufferings But if the purpose of lamentation be to excite pity and if pity must presuppose sympathy it is surely superfluous for age and weakness to tell their plaintive stories for a little attention will shew them that those who do not feel pain seldom think that it is felt and a short recollection will inform almost every man that he is only repaid the insult which he has given since he may remember how often he has treated infirmity with contempt mocked its cautions and censured its impatience  THE valetudinarian race have made the care of health ridiculous by suffering it to prevail over all other considerations as the miser has brought frugality into contempt by permitting the love of money not to share but to engross his mind they both err alike by confounding the means with the end they grasp at health only to be well as at money only to be rich and forget that every terrestrial advantage is chiefly valuable as it furnishes abilities for the exercise of virtue  HEALTH is indeed so necessary to all the duties as well as pleasures of life that the crime of squandering it is equal to the folly and he that for the sake of a few short gratifications brings weakness and diseases upon himself and for the pleasure of a few years passed in riot and noise in the tumults of diversion and clamours of merriment condemns the maturer and more experienced part of his life to the chamber and the couch may be justly reproached not only as a spendthrift of his own happiness but as a robber of the publick as a wretch that has voluntarily disqualified himself for the business of his station and refused that part which providence assigns him in the general task of human nature  THERE are perhaps very few conditions more to be pitied than that of an active and elevated mind labouring under the weight of a distempered body the time of such a man is always spent in forming schemes which a change of wind hinders him from executing his powers fume away in projects and in hope and the day of action never arrives He lies down delighted with the thoughts of  tomorrow pleases his ambition with the same he shall acquire or his benevolence with the good he shall confer But in the night the skies are overcast the temper of the air is changed he wakes in languor impatience and distraction and has no longer any wish but for ease nor any attention but to misery It may be said that disease generally begins that equality which death completes the distinctions which set one man so much above another are very little perceived in the gloom of a sick chamber where it will be in vain to expect entertainment from the gay or instruction from the wise where all human glory is obliterated where the wit is clouded the reasonner embarrassed and the hero subdued where the highest and brightest of mortal beings finds nothing left him but the consciousness of innocence  THERE is among the fragments of the Greek poets a short hymn to Health in which her power of exalting the happiness of life of heightening the gifts of fortune and adding enjoyment to possession is inculcated with so much force and beauty that no one at least no one who has ever languished under the discomforts and infirmities of a lingering  disease can read it without feeling the images dance in his heart and adding from his own experience new vigour to the wish and from his own imagination new colours to the picure The particular occasion of this little composition is not known but it is probable that the author had been sick and in the first raptures of returning vigour addressed Health in the following manner  HEALTH most venerable of the powers of heaven with thee may the remaining part of my life be passed nor do thou refuse to bless me with thy residence For whatever there is of beauty or of pleasure in wealth in descendants or in sovereign command the highest summit of human enjoyment or in those objects of desire which  we endeavour to chase into the toils of love whatever delight or whatever solace is granted by the celestials to soften our fatigues in thy presence thou parent of happiness all those joys spread out and flourish in thy presence blooms the spring of pleasure and without thee there is no gladness  SUCH is the power of health that without its cooperation every other comfort is torpid and lifeless as the powers of vegetation without the sun And yet this bliss is commonly thrown away in thoughtless negligence or in foolish experiments on our own strength we let it perish without remembring its value or waste it to shew how much we have to spare it is sometimes given up to the management of levity and chance and sometimes sold for the applause of jollity and debauchery  HEALTH is equally neglected and with equal impropriety by the votaries of business and the followers of pleasure Some men ruin the fabrick of their bodies by incessant revels and others by intemperate studies some batter it by excess and others sap it by inactivity To the noisy rout of bacch analian rioters it will be to little purpose that advice is  offered though it requires no great abilities to prove that he loses pleasure who loses health their clamours are too loud for the whispers of caution and they run the course of life with too much precipitance to stop at the call of wisdom Nor perhaps will they that are busied in adding thousands to thousands pay much regard to him that shall direct them to hasten more slowly to their wishes Yet since lovers of money are generally cool deliberate and thoughtful they might surely consider that the greater good ought not to be sacrificed to the less Health is certainly more valuable than money because it is by health that money is procured but thousands and millions are of small avail to alleviate the protracted tortures of the gout to repair the broken organs of sense or resuscitate the powers of digestion Poverty is indeed an evil from which we naturally fly but let us not run from one enemy to another nor take shelter in the arms of sickness  Projecere animam quàm vellent aethere in alto  Nunc pauperiem duros tolerare labores  THOSE who lose their health in an irregular and impetuous persuit of literary accomplishments are yet less to be excused for as  they profess argument and reflection they ought to know that the body is not forced beyond its strength but with the loss of more vigour than is proportionate to the effect produced and that whoever takes up life beforehand by depriving himself of rest and refreshment must not only pay back the hours but pay them back with usury and for the gain of a few months but half enjoyed must give up years to the listlesness of languor and the implacability of pain they whose endeavour is mental excellence will learn at last perhaps too late how much it is endangered by diseases of the body and find that knowledge may easily be lost in the starts of melancholy the flights of impatience and the peevishness of decrepitude  NUMB  TUESDAY  September    Non omnis moriar multaque pars mei  Vitabit Libitinam usque ego posterâ  Crescam laude recens  HOR  THE first motives of human actions are those appetites which providence has given to most in common with the rest of the inhabitants  of the earth Immediately after our birth thirst and hunger incline us to the breast whch we draw by instinct like other young creatures and when we are satisfied we express our uneasiness by importunate and incessant cries till we have obtained a place or posture proper for repose  THE next call that rouses us from a state of inactivity is that of our passions we quickly begin to be sensible of hope and fear love and hatred desire and aversion these arising from the power of comparison and reflection extend their range wider as our reason strengthens and our knowledge enlarges At first we have no thought of pain but when we actually feel it we afterwards begin to fear it yet not before it approaches us very nearly but by degrees we discover it at a greater distance and find it lurking in remote consequences Our terror in time improves into caution and we learn to look round with vigilance and solicitude to stop all the avenues at which misery can enter and to perform or endure many things in themselves toilsome and unpleasing because we know by reason or by experience that our labour will be overbalanced by the reward that it will either  procure some positive good or avert some evil greater than itself  BUT as the soul advances to a fuller exercise of its powers the animal appetites and the passions immediately arising from them are not sufficient to find it employment the wants of nature are soon supplied the fear of their return is easily precluded and something more is necessary to relieve the long intervals of inactivity and to give those faculties which cannot lie wholly quiescent some particular direction For this reason now desires and artificial passions are by degrees produced and from having wishes only in consequence of our wants we begin to feel wants in consequence of our wishes we persuade ourselves to set a value upon things which are of no use but because we have agreed to value them things which can neither satisfy hunger nor mitigate pain nor secure us from any real calamity and which therefore we find of no esteem among those nations whose artless and barbarous manners keep them always anxious for the necessaries of life  THIS is the original of avarice vanity ambition and generally of all those desires  which arise from the comparison of our condition with that of others He that thinks himself poor because his neighbour is richer he that like Caesar would rather be the first man of a village than the second in the capital of the world has apparently kindled in himself desires which he never received from nature and acts upon principles established only by the authority of custom  OF those adscititious passions some as avarice and envy are universally condemned some as friendship and curiosity generally praised but there are others about which the suffrages of the wise are divided and of which it is doubted whether they tend most to promote the happiness or increase the miseries of mankind  OF this ambiguous and disputable kind is the love of fame a desire of filling the minds of others with admiration and of being celebrated by generations to come with praises which we shall not hear This ardour has been considered by some as nothing better than splendid madness as a flame kindled by pride and fanned by folly for what say they can be more remote from wisdom than to direct  all our actions by the hope of that which is not to exist till we ourselves are in the grave To pant after that which can never be possessed and of which the value thus wildly put upon it arises from this particular condition that during life it is not to be obtained To gain the favour and hear the applauses of our contemporaries is indeed equally desirable with any other prerogative of superiority because fame may be of use to smooth the paths of life to terrify opposition and fortify tranquillity but to what end shall we be the darlings of mankind when we can no longer receive any benefits from their favour It is more reasonable to wish for reputation while it may be yet enjoyed as Anacreon calls upon his companions to give him for present use the wine and garlands which they purpose to bestow upon his tomb  THE advocates for the love of fame allege in its vindication that it is a passion natural and universal a flame lighted by heaven and always burning with greatest vigour in the most enlarged and elevated minds That the desire of being praised by posterity implies a resolution to deserve their praises and that the folly charged upon it is only a noble and  disinterested generosity which is not felt and therefore not understood by those who have been always accustomed to refer every thing to themselves and whose selfishness has contracted their understandings That the soul of man formed for eternal life naturally springs forward beyond the limits of corporeal existence and rejoices to consider herself as cooperating with future ages and as coextended with endless duration That the censure urged with so much petulance the reproach of labouring for what cannot be enjoyed is founded on an opinion which may with great probability be questioned for since we suppose the powers of the soul to be enlarged by its separation why should we conclude that its knowledge of sublunary transactions is contracted or extinguished  UPON an attentive and impartial review of the argument it will appear that the love of fame is to be regulated rather than extinguished and that men should be taught not to be wholly careless about their memory but to endeavour that they may be remembered chiefly for their virtues since no other reputation will be able to transmit any pleasure beyond the grave  IT is evident that fame considered  as the immortality of a name is not less likely to be the reward of bad actions than of good and that therefore he has no certain principle for the regulation of his conduct whose single aim is not to be forgotten and history will inform us that this blind and undistinguishing appetite of renown has always been uncertain in its effects and directed by accident or opportunity indifferently to the benefit or devastation of the world When Themistocles complained that the trophies of Miltiades hindered him from sleep he was animated by them to perform the same services in the same cause But Caesar when he wept at the sight of Alexander's picture having no honest opportunities of action let his ambition break out to the ruin of his country  IF therefore the love of same is so far indulged by the mind as to become independent and predominant it is dangerous and irregular but it may be usefully employed as an inferior and secondary motive and will serve sometimes to revive our activity when we begin to languish and lose sight of that more certain more valuable and more durable reward which ought always to be our first hope and  our last But it must be strongly impressed upon our minds that virtue is not to be persued as one of the means to fame but fame to be accepted as the only recompence which mortals can bestow on virtue to be accepted with complacence but not sought with eagerness Simply to be remembered is no advantage it is a privilege which satire as well as panegyric can confer and is not more enjoyed by Titus or Constantine than by Timocreon of Rhodes of whom we only know from his epitaph  that he had eaten many a meal drank many a flaggon and uttered many a reproach  THE true satisfaction which is to be drawn from the consciousness that we shall share the attention of future times must arise from the hope that with our name our virtues will be propagated and that those whom we cannot benefit in our lives may receive instruction from our examples and incitement from our renown  NUMB  SATURDAY  Sept    Credebant hoc grande nefas et morte piandum  Si juvenis vetulo non assurrexerat atque  Barbato cuicunque puer licet ipse videret  Plura demi fraga et majores glandis acervos  JUV  I HAVE always thought it the business of those who turn their speculations upon the living world to admire and commend the virtues as well as to expose and censure the faults of their contemporaries and to confute a false as well as to support a just accusation not only because it is peculiarly the business of a monitor to keep his own reputation without taint lest those who can once charge him with partiality should indulge themselves afterwards in disbelieving him at pleasure but because he may find real crimes sufficient to give full employment to caution or repentance without distracting the mind by needless scruples and vain solicitudes  THERE are certain fixed and stated reproaches that one part of mankind has in all ages  thrown upon another which are regularly transmitted through continued successions and which he that has once suffered them is certain to use with the same undistinguishing vehemence when he has changed his station and gained the prescriptive right of imposing on others what he had formerly endured himself  TO these hereditary imputations of which no man sees the justice till it becomes his interest to see it very little regard is to be shewn since it does not appear that they are produced by ratiocination or enquiry but received implicitly or caught by a kind of instantaneous contagion and supported rather by willingness to credit than ability to prove them  IT has been in all ages of the world the practice of those who are desirous to believe themselves made venerable by length of time to censure the new comers into life for want of respect to grey hairs and sage experience for heady considence in their own understandings for hasty conclusions upon partial views for a contemptuous disregard of those salutary counsels which their fathers and grandsires  are always ready to afford them and a rebellious impatience of that subordination to which youth is condemned by nature as necessary to its security from those evils into which it would be otherwise inevitably precipitated by the rashness of passion and the blindness of ignorance  EVERY old man complains of the growing depravity of the world of the petulance and insolence of the rising generation He recounts the decency and regularity of former times and celebrates the discipline and sobriety of the age in which his youth was passed a happy age which is now no more to be expected since confusion has broke in upon the world and thrown down all the boundaries of civility reverence and obedience  IT is not always sufficiently considered how much he assumes who dares to claim the privilege of complaining for as every man has in his own opinion a full share of the miseries of life he is inclined to consider all clamorous uneasiness as a proof of impatience rather than of affliction and to ask What merit has this man to show by which he has acquired a right to repine at the distributions of  nature Or why does he imagine that exemptions should be granted him from the general condition of man We find ourselves excited rather to captiousness than pity and instead of being in haste to sooth his complaints by sympathy and tenderness we enquire whether the pain be proportionate to the lamentation and whether supposing his afflictions real they are not the effect of vice and folly rather than of calamity  THE querulousness and indignation which is observed so often to disfigure the last scene of life naturally leads us to enquiries like these For surely it will be thought at the first view of things that if age be thus contemned and ridiculed insulted and neglected the crime must at least be equal on either part since they who have had so many opportunities of establishing their authority over minds ductile and unresisting they who have been the protectors of helplessness and the instructors of ignorance and who yet retain in their own hands the power of wealth and the dignity of command must defeat their influence by their own misconduct and make use of all these advantages with very little skill if they cannot secure to themselves an appearance of respect  and ward off open mockery and declared contempt  THE general story of mankind will evince that lawful and settled authority is very seldom resisted when it is well employed and that gross corruption or evident imbecillity is necessary to the conquest of that prepossession with which the majority of mankind look upon their governors on those whom they see surrounded by splendor and fortified by power for tho' men are drawn by their passions into forgetfulness of invisible rewards and punishments yet they are easily kept obedient to those who have temporal dominion in their hands till their veneration is dissipated by such wickedness and folly as can neither be defended palliated nor concealed  IT may therefore very reasonably be suspected that the old draw upon themselves the greatest part of those insults which they so much lament and that age is rarely despised but when it is contemptible If men imagine that excess or debauchery can be made reverend by time that knowledge is the consequence of long life however idly and thoughtlesly employed that priority of birth will supply  the want of steadiness or honesty and that the regard will be paid to wrinkles which is due only to wisdom can it raise much wonder that their hopes are disappointed and that they see their posterity rather willing to trust their own eyes in their progress into life than enlist themselves under guides who have lost their way  THERE are indeed many truths which time necessarily and certainly teaches and which might by those who have learned them from experience be communicated to their successors at a cheaper rate but dictates though liberally enough bestowed are generally without effect because they are seldom recommended by sufficient authority the teacher gains few proselytes by instruction which his own behaviour contradicts young men miss the benefit of counsel because they want the more powerful attraction of example and are not very ready to believe that those who fall below them in practice can much excel them in theory Thus the progress of mankind in knowledge is retarded the world is kept long in the same state and every new race is to gain the prudence of their  predecessors by commiting and redressing the same miscarriages  TO secure to the old that influence which they are willing to claim and which might so much contribute to the improvement of the arts of life it is absolutely necessary that they give themselves up to the duties of declining years and contentedly resign to youth its levity its pleasures its frolicks and its sopperies It is a lifeless endeavour to unite the contrarieties of spring and winter and unjust to claim the privileges of age and retain the playthings of childhood Young men always form magnificent ideas of the wisdom and gravity of those whom they consider as plaed at a distance from them in the ranks of existence and naturally look on those whom they find trissing with long beards and luxurious and vain on the brink of the grave with contempt and indignation like that which women feel at the effeminacy of men If dotards will contend with boys in those performances in which boys must always excel them if they will dress crippled limbs in embroidery and endeavour at gayety with faltering voices if they will drag infirmity to the ball and darken assemblies of pleasure with the ghastliness  of disease they may well expect that those who find their diversions obstructed will hoot them away and that if they descend to competition with youth they must bear the insolence of successful rivals  Lusisti satis edisti satis atque bibisti  Tempus abire tibi est  ANOTHER vice of age by which the rising generation may be alienated from it is severity and censoriousness a disposition of mind that gives no allowance to the failings of early life that expects artfulness from childhood and constancy from youth that is peremptory in every command and inexorable to every failure There are many who live merely to hinder happiness and whose descendants can only tell of long life that it produces suspicion malignity peevishness and persecution and yet even they can talk of the ingratitude of the age curse their heirs for impatience and wonder that young men cannot take pleasure in their fathers' company  He that would pass the latter part of life with honour and decency must when he is young consider that he shall one day be old  and lay up knowledge for his support when his powers of acting shall forsake him and remember when he is old that he has once been young and forbear to animadvert with unnecessary rigour on faults which experience only can correct  NUMB  TUESDAY  Sept    Stultus labor est ineptiarum  MART  To the RAMBLER  SIR  AS you have allowed a place in your paper to Euphelia's letters from the country and appear to think no form of human life unworthy of your attention I have resolved after many struggles with idleness and diffidence to give you some account of my entertainment in this sober season of universal retreat and to describe to you the employments of those who look with contempt on the pleasures and diversions of polite life and employ all their powers of censure and invective  upon the uselessness vanity and folly of dress visits and conversation  WHEN a tiresome and vexatious journey of four days had brought me to the house where an invitation regularly sent for seven years together had at last induced me to pass the summer I was surprised after the civilities of my first reception to find instead of the leisure and tranquillity which a rural life always promises and if well conducted might always afford a confused wildness of care and a tumultuous hurry of diligence by which every face was clouded and every motion agitated The old lady who is my father's relation was indeed very full of the happiness which she received from my visit and according to the forms of obsolete breeding insisted that I should recompense the long delay of my company with a promise not to leave her till winter But amidst all her kindness and caresses she very frequently turned her head aside and whispered with anxious earnestness some order to her daughters which never failed to send them out with unpolite precipitation Sometimes her impatience would not suffer her to stay behind she begged my pardon she must leave me for a moment  she went and returned and sat down again but was again disturbed by some new care dismissed her daughters with the same trepidation and followed them with the same countenance of business and solicitude  HOWEVER I was alarmed at this show of eagerness and disturbance and however my curiosity was excited by such busy preparations as naturally promised some great event I was yet too much a stranger to gratify myself with enquiries but finding none of the family in mourning I pleased myself with imagining that I should rather see a wedding than a funeral  AT last we sat down to supper when I was informed that one of the young ladies after whom I thought myself obliged to enquire was under a necessity of attending some affair that could not be neglected soon after my relation began to talk of the regularity of her family and the inconvenience of London hours and at last let me know that they had purposed that night to go to bed sooner than was usual because they were to rise early in the morning to make cheesecakes This hint sent me to my chamber to which I was accompanied  by all the ladies who begged me to excuse some large sieves of leaves and flowers that covered two thirds of the floor for they intended to distil them when they were dry and they had no other room that so conveniently received the rising sun  THE scent of the plants hindered me from rest and therefore I rose early in the morning with a resolution to explore my new habitation I stole unperceived by my busy cousins into the garden where I found nothing either more great or elegant than in the same number of acres cultivated for the market Of the gardener I soon learned that his lady was the greatest manager in that part of the country and that I was come hither at the time in which I might learn to make more pickles and conserves than could be seen at any other house a hundred miles round  IT was not long before her ladyship gave me sufficient opportunities of knowing her character for she was too much pleased with her own accomplishments to conceal them and took occasion from some sweetmeats which she set next day upon the table to discourse for two long hours upon robs and gellies  laid down the best methods of conserving reserving and preserving all sorts of fruit told us with great contempt of the London lady in the neighbourhood by whom these terms were very often confounded and hinted how much she should be ashamed to set before company at her own house sweetmeats of so dark a colour as she had often seen at mistress Sprightly's  IT is indeed the great business of her life to watch the skillet on the fire to see it simmer with the due degree of heat and to snatch it off at the moment of projection and the employments to which she has bred her daughters are to turn roseleaves in the shade to pick out the seeds of currants with a quill to gather fruit without bruising it and to extract beanflower water for the skin Such are the tasks with which every day since I came hither has begun and ended to which the early hours of life are sacrificed and in which that time is passing away which never shall return  BUT to reason or expostulate are hopeless attempts The lady has settled her opinions and maintains the dignity of her own performances  with all the firmness of stupidity accustomed to be flattered Her daughters having never seen any house but their own believe their mother's excellence on her own word Her husband is a mere sportsman who is pleased to see his table well furnished and thinks the day sufficiently successful in which he brings home a leash of hares to be potted by his wife  AFTER a few days I pretended to want books but my lady soon told me that none of her books would suit my taste for her part she never loved to see young women give their minds to such follies by which they would only learn to use hard words she bred up her daughters to understand a house and whoever should marry them if they knew any thing of good cookery would never repent it  THERE are however some things in the culinary science too sublime for youthful intellects mysteries into which they must not be initiated till the years of serious maturity and which are referred to the day of marriage as the supreme qualification for connubial life She makes an orange pudding which is the envy of all the neighbourhood and  which she has hitherto found means of mixing and baking with such secrecy that the ingredient to which it owes its flavour has never been discovered She indeed conducts this great affair with all the caution that human policy can suggest It is never known beforehand when this pudding will be produced she takes the ingredients privately into her own closet employs her maids and daughters in different parts of the house orders the oven to be heated for a pye and places the pudding in it with her own hands the mouth of the oven is then stopped and all enquiries are vain  THE composition of the pudding she has however promised Clarinda that if she pleases her in marriage she shall be told without reserve But the art of making English capers she has not yet persuaded herself to discover but seems resolved that secret shall perish with her as some alchymists have obstinately suppressed the art of transmuting metals  I ONCE ventured to lay my fingers on her book of receipts which she left upon the table having intelligence that a vessel of gooseberry wine had burst the hoops But though the  importance of the event sufficiently engrossed her care to prevent any recollection of the danger to which her secrets were exposed I was not able to make use of the golden moments for this treasure of hereditary knowledge was so well concealed by the manner of spelling used by her grandmother her mother and herself that I was totally unable to understand it and lost the opportunity of consulting the oracle for want of knowing the language in which its answers were returned  IT is indeed necessary if I have any regard to her ladyship's esteem that I should apply myself to some of these oeconomical accomplishments for I overheard her two days ago warning her daughters by my mournful example against negligence of pastry and ignorance in carving for you saw said she that with all her pretensions to knowledge she turned the partridge the wrong way when she attempted to cut it and I believe scarcely knows the difference between paste raised and paste in a dish  THE reason Mr Rambler why I have laid Lady Bustle's character before you is a desire to be informed whether in your opinion  it is worthy of imitation and whether I shall throw away the books which I have hitherto thought it my duty to read for  the lady's closet opened    the compleat servantmaid  and  the court cook  and resign all curiosity after right and wrong for the art of scalding damascenes without bursting them and preserving the whiteness of pickled mushrooms  LADY Bustle has indeed by this incessant application to fruits and flowers contracted her cares into a narrow space and set herself free from many perplexities with which other minds are disturbed She has no curiosity after the events of a war or the fate of heroes in distress she can hear without the least emotion the ravage of a fire or devastations of a storm her neighbours grow rich or poor come into the world or go out of it without regard while she is pressing the gellybag or airing the storeroom but I cannot perceive that she is more free from disquiets than those whose understandings take a wider range Her marigolds when they are almost cured are often scattered by the wind the rain sometimes falls upon fruit when it ought to be gathered dry While her artificial wines are fermenting her spirits are disturbed with the  utmost restlessness of anxiety Her sweetmeats are not always bright and the maid sometimes forgets the just proportions of salt and pepper when venison is to be baked Her conserves mould her wines sour and pickles mother and like all the rest of mankind she is every day mortified with the defeat of her schemes and the disappointment of her hopes  WITH regard to vice and virtue she seems a kind of neutral being She has no crime but luxury nor any virtue but chastity she has no desire to be praised but for her cookery nor wishes any ill to the rest of mankind but that whenever they aspire to a feast their custards may be wheyish and their pyecrusts tough  I AM now very impatient to know whether I am to look on these ladies as the great patterns of our sex and to consider conserves and pickles as the business of my life whether the censures which I now suffer be just and whether the brewers of wines and the distillers of washes have a right to look with insolence on the weakness of  CORNELIA  NUMB  SATURDAY  September    Quoties flenti  Theseius  heros  Siste modum dixit neque enim fortuna querenda  Sola tua est similes aliorum respice casus  Mitius ista feres  OVID  AMONG the various methods of consolation to which the miseries inseparable from our present state have given occasion it has been as I have already remarked recommended by some writers to put the sufferer in mind of heavier pressures and more excruciating calamities than those of which he has himself reason to complain  THIS has in all ages been directed and practised and in conformity to this custom Lipsius the great modern master of the Stoic philosophy has in his celebrated treatise on  steadiness of mind  endeavoured to fortify the breast against too much sensibility of misfortune by enumerating the great evils which have in former ages fallen upon the world the devastation of wideextended regions the sack of cities and the massacre of nations  And the common voice of the multitude uninstructed by precept and unprejudiced by authority which in questions that relate to the heart of man is in my opinion more decisive than the learning of Lipsius seems to justify the efficacy of this procedure for one of the first comforts which one neighbour administers to another is a relation of the like infelicity combined with circumstances of greater bitterness  BUT this medicine of the mind is like many remedies applied to the body of which though we see the effects most are unacquainted with the manner of operation and of which therefore some who are unwilling to suppose any thing out of the reach of their own sagacity have been inclined to doubt whether they have really those virtues for which they are celebrated and whether their reputation is not the mere gift of fancy prejudice and credulity  CONSOLATION or comfort are words which in their proper acceptation signify some alleviation of that pain to which it is not in our power to afford the proper and adequate remedy they imply rather an augmentation  of the power of bearing than a diminution of the burthen A prisoner is relieved by him that sets him at liberty but receives comfort from such as suggests considerations by which he is enabled to be more patient under the inconvenience of confinement To that grief which arises from a great loss he only brings the true remedy who makes his friend's condition the same as before but he may be properly termed a comforter who by his counsel and persuasions extenuates the pain of poverty and shews in the style of  Hesiod  that  half is more than the whole  IT is perhaps not immediately obvious how it can lull the memory of misfortune or appease the throbbings of anguish to hear that others are more miserable others perhaps unknown or wholly indifferent whose prosperity raises no envy and whose fall can gratify no resentment Some topics of comfort arising like that which gave hope and spirit to the captive of Sesostris from the perpetual vicissitudes of life and mutability of human affairs may as properly raise the dejected as depress the proud and have an immediate and necessary tendency to exhilarate and revive But how can it avail the man  who languishes in the gloom of sorrow without prospect of emerging into the sunshine of chearfulness to hear that others are sunk yet deeper in the dungeon of misery shackled with heavier chains and surrounded with darker desperation  THE solace arising from this consideration seems indeed the weakest of all others and is perhaps never properly applied but in cases where there is no place for reflexions of more speedy and pleasing efficacy But even from such calamities life is by no means free a thousand ills incurable a thousand losses irreparable a thousand difficulties insurmountable are known or will be known by all the sons of men Native deformity cannot be rectified a dead friend cannot return and the hours of youth trifled away in folly or lost in sickness cannot be restored  UNDER the oppression of such melancholy it has been found useful to take a survey of the world to contemplate the various scenes of distress in which mankind are struggling round us and acquaint ourselves with the  terribiles visu formae  the various shapes of misery which make havock of terrestrial happiness  range all corners almost without restraint trample down our hopes at the hour of harvest and when we have built our schemes to the top ruin their foundations  THE first effect of this meditation is that it furnishes a new employment for the mind and engages the passions to remoter objects as kings have sometimes freed themselves from the turbulence of a subject too haughty to be governed and too powerful to be crushed by posting him in a distant province till his popularity has subsided or his pride been repressed The attention is dissipated by variety and acts more weakly upon any single part as that torrent may be drawn off to different channels which pouring down in one collect+ed body cannot be resisted This species of comfort is therefore useless in severe paroxysms of corporal pain when the mind is every instant called back to misery and in the first shock of any sudden evil but will certainly be of use against encroaching melancholy and a settled habit of gloomy thoughts  IT is further advantageous as it supplies us with opportunities of making comparisons in our own favour We know that very little  of the pain or pleasure which does not begin and end in our senses is otherwise than relative we are rich or poor great or little in proportion to the number that excel us or fall beneath us in any of these respects and therefore a man whose uneasiness arises from reflection on any misfortune that throws him below those with whom he was once equal is comforted by finding that he is not yet lowest  BUT there is another kind of comparison less tending towards the vice of envy very well illustrated by an old poet whose system will not afford many reasonable motives to content 'It is' says he 'pleasing to look from shore upon the tumults of a storm and to see a ship struggling with the billows it is pleasing not because the pain of another can give us delight but because we have a stronger impression of the happiness of safety' Thus when we look abroad and behold the multitudes that are groaning under evils heavier than those which we have experienced we shrink back to our own state and instead of repining that so much must be felt learn to rejoice that we have not more to feel  BY this observation of the miseries of others fortitude is strengthened and the mind brought to a more extensive knowledge of her own powers As the heroes of action catch the flame from one another so they to whom providence has allotted the harder task of suffering with calmness and dignity may animate themselves by the remembrance of those evils which have been laid on others perhaps naturally as weak as themselves and bear up with vigour and resolution against their own oppressions when they see it yet possible that more severe afflictions may be born  THERE is still another reason why to many minds the relation of other mens' infelicity may give a lasting and continual relief Some not well instructed in the measures by which providence distributes happiness are perhaps misled by divines who as Bellarmine makes temporal prosperity one of the characters of the true church have represented wealth and ease as the certain concomitants of virtue and the unfailing result of the divine approbation Such sufferers are dejected in their misfortunes not so much for what they feel as for what they dread not because  they cannot support the sorrows or endure the wants of their present condition but because they consider them as only the beginnings of more sharp and more lasting pains To these mourners it is an act of the highest charity to represent the calamities which not only virtue has suffered but virtue has incurred to inform them that one evidence of a future state is the uncertainty of any present reward for goodness and to remind them from the highest authority of the distresses and penury of men  of whom the world was not worthy  NUMB  TUESDAY  Sept    Epigram Vet  THERE is scarcely among those evils to which human life is exposed any so generally dreaded as poverty Every other species of misery those who are not much accustomed to disturb the present moment with reflexion can easily forget because it is not always forced upon their regard but it is impossible to pass a day or an hour in the confluxes  of men without seeing how much indigence is exposed to contumely neglect and insult and in its lowest state to hunger and nakedness to injuries against which every passion is in arms and to wants which nature cannot sustain  AGAINST other evils the heart is often hardened by true or by false notions of dignity and reputation thus we see dangers of every kind faced with willingness because bravery in a good or bad cause is never without its encomiasts and admirers But in the prospect of poverty there is nothing but gloom and melancholy the mind and body suffer together its miseries bring no alleviations it is a state in which every virtue is obscured and in which no conduct can avoid reproach a state in which chearfulness is insensibility and dejection sullenness of which the hardships are without honour and the labours without reward  OF these calamities there seems not to be wanting a general conviction we hear on every side the noise of trade and see the streets thronged with numberless multitudes whose faces are clouded with anxiety and whose  steps are hurried by precipitation from no other motive than the hope of gain and the whole world is put in motion by the desire of that wealth which is chiefly to be valued as it secures us from poverty for it is more useful for defence than acquisition and is not so much able to procure good as to exclude evil  YET there are always some whose passions or follies lead them to a conduct opposite to the general maxims and practice of mankind some who seem to rush upon poverty with the same eagerness with which others avoid it who see their revenues hourly lessened and the estates which they inherit from their ancestors mouldering away without resolution to change their course of life and persevere against all remonstrances and go forward with full career though they see before them the precipice of destruction  IT is not my purpose in this paper to expostulate with such as ruin their fortunes by expensive schemes of buildings and gardens which they carry on with the same vanity that prompted them to begin chusing as it happens in a thousand other cases the remote evil before the lighter and deferring the  shame of repentance till they incur the miseries of distress Those for whom I intend my present admonitions are the thoughtless the negligent and the dissolute who having by the viciousness of their own inclinations or the seducements of alluring companions been engaged in habits of expence and accustomed to move in a certain round of pleasures disproportioned to their condition are without power to extricate themselves from the enchantments of custom avoid thought because they know it will be painful and continue from day to day and from month to month to anticipate their revenues and sink every hour deeper into the gulphs of usury and extortion  THIS folly has less claim to pity because it cannot be imputed to the vehemence of sudden passion nor can the mischief which it produces be extenuated as the effect of any single act which rage or desire might execute before there could be time for an appeal to reason These men are advancing towards misery by soft approaches and destroying themselves not by the violence of a blow which when once given can never be recalled  but by a slow poison hourly repeated and obstinately continued  THIS conduct is so absurd when it is examined by the unprejudiced eye of rational judgment that nothing but experience could evince its possibility yet absurd as it is the sudden fall of some families and the sudden rise of others prove it to be common and every year sees many wretches reduced to contempt and want by their costly sacrifices to pleasure and vanity  IT is the fate of almost every passion when it has passed the bounds which nature prescribes to counteract its own purpose Too much rage hinders the warrior from circumspection too much eagerness of profit hurts the credit of the trader too much ardor takes away from the lover that easiness of address with which ladies are delighted Thus extravagance though dictated by vanity and incited by voluptuousness seldom procures ultimately either applause or pleasure  IF praise be justly estimated by the character of those from whom it is received little satisfaction will be given to the spendthrift by  the encomiums which he purchases For who are they that animate him in his persuits but young men thoughtless and abandoned like himself unacquainted with all on which the wisdom of nations has impressed the stamp of excellence and devoid alike of knowledge and of virtue By whom in his profusion praised but by wretches who consider him as subservient to their purposes Sirens that entice him to shipwreck and Cyclops that are gaping to devour him  EVERY man whose knowledge or whose virtue can give value to his opinion looks with scorn or pity neither of which can afford much gratification to pride on him whom the pandars of luxury have drawn into the circle of their influence and whom he sees parcelled out among the different ministers of folly and about to be torn to pieces by taylors and jockeys vintners and attorneys by whom he is at once robbed and ridiculed and who are secretly triumphing over his weakness when they present new incitements to his appetite and heighten his desire by counterfeited applause  SUCH is the praise that is purchased by prodigality  even when it is yet not discovered to be false it is the praise only of those whom it is reproachful to please and whose sincerity is corrupted by their interest men who live by the riots which they encourage and who know that when ever their pupil grows wise they shall lose their power Yet with such flatteries if they could last might the cravings of vanity which is seldom very delicate be satisfied but the time is always hastening forward when this triumph poor as it is shall vanish and when those who now surround him with obsequiousness and compliments fawn among his equipage and animate his rio  s shall turn upon him with insolence and reproach him with the vices promoted by themselves  AND as little pretensions has the man who squanders his estate by vain or vicious expences to greater degrees of pleasure than are obtained by others To make any happiness sincere it is necessary that we believe it to be lasting since whatever we suppose ourselves in danger of losing must be enjoyed with solicitude and uneasiness and the more value we set upon it the more must the present possession be imbittered How can he then be envied  for his felicity who knows that its continuance cannot be expected and who is conscious that a very short time will give him up to the gripe of poverty which will be harder to be born as he has given way to more excesses wantoned in greater abundance and indulged his appetites with more profuseness  IT appears evident that frugality is necessary even to complete the pleasure of expence for it may be generally remarked of those who squander what they know their fortune not sufficient to allow that in their most jovial expence there always breaks out some proof of discontent and impatience they either scatter with a kind of wild desperation and affected lavishness as criminals brave the gallows when they cannot escape it or pay their money with a peevish anxiety and endeavour at once to spend idly and to save meanly having neither firmness to deny their passions nor courage to gratify them but murmuring at their own enjoyments and poisoning the bowl of pleasure by reflexion on the cost  AMONG these men there is often the vociferation of merriment but very seldom the tranquillity of chearfulness they inflame their  imaginations to a kind of momentary jollity by the help of wine and riot and consider it as the first business of the night to stupify recollection and lay that reason asleep which disturbs their gayety and calls upon them to retreat from ruin  BUT this poor broken satisfaction is of short continuance and must be expiated by a long series of misery and regret In a short time the creditor grows impatient the last acre is sold the passions and appetites still continue their tyranny with incessant calls for their usual gratifications and the remainder of life passes away in vain repentance or impotent desire  NUMB  SATURDAY  September    Truditur dies die  Novaeque pergunt interire lunae  Tu secanda marmora  Locas sub ipsum funus et sepulchri  Immemor struis domos  HOR  To the RAMBLER  SIR  I HAVE lately been called from a mingled life of business and amusement to attend  the last hours of an old friend an office which has filled me if not with melancholy at least with serious reflexions and turned my thoughts towards the contemplation of those subjects which though of the utmost importance and of indubitable certainty are generally secluded from our regard by the jollity of health the hurry of employment and even by the calmer diversions of study and speculation or if they become accidental topics of conversation and argument yet rarely sink deep into the heart but give occasion only to some subtilties of reasoning or some elegancies of declamation which are heard applauded and forgotten  IT is indeed not hard to conceive how a man accustomed to extend his views through a long concatenation of causes and effects to trace things from their origin to their period and compare means with ends may discover the weakness of human schemes detect the fallacies by which we are deluded shew the insufficiency of wealth honours and power to real happiness and please himself and his auditors with learned lectures on the vanity of life  BUT though the speculatist may see and shew the folly of terrestrial hopes fears and desires every hour will give proofs that he never felt it Trace him through the paths of life and you will find him acting upon principles which he has in common with unenlightened mortals angry and pleased like the lowest of the vulgar persuing with the same ardor the same designs grasping with all the eagerness of transport those riches which he knows he cannot keep and swelling with the applause which he has gained by Proving that applause is of no value  THE only conviction which rushes upon the soul and takes away from our appetites and passions the power of resistance is to be found where I have received it at the bed of a dying friend To enter the school of wisdom is not the peculiar privilege of geometricians the most sublime and important precepts require no uncommon opportunities nor laborious preparations they are enforced without the aid of eloquence and understood without skill in analytic science Every tongue can utter them and every understanding can conceive them He that wishes in  earnest to obtain just sentiments concerning his condition he that would be intimately acquainted with the world may find instructions on every side he that desires to enter behind the scene which every art has been employed to decorate and every passion labours to illuminate and to see life stripped of those ornaments which make it glitter on the stage and exposed in its natural meanness impotence and nakedness may find all the delusion laid open in the chamber of disease he will there find vanity divested of her robes power deprived of her sceptre and hypocrisy without her mask  THE friend whom I have lost was a man eminent for genius and like others of the same class sufficiently pleased with acceptance and applause Being caressed by those who have preferments and riches in their disposal he considered himself as in the direct road of advancement and had caught the flame of ambition by approaches to its object But in the midst of his hopes his projects and his gayeties he was seized by a lingering disease which from its first stage he knew to be incurable Here was an end of all his visions of greatness and happiness from the first  hour that his health declined all his former pleasures grew tasteless His friends expected to please him by those accounts of the growth of his reputation which were formerly certain of being well received but they soon found how little he was now affected by compliments and how vainly they attempted by flattery to exhilarate the languor of weakness and relieve the solicitude of approaching death Whoever would know how much piety and virtue surpass all external goods might here have seen them weighed against each other where all that gives motion to the active and elevation to the eminent all that sparkles in the eye of hope and pants in the bosom of suspicion at once became dust in the balance without weight and without regard Riches authority and praise lose all their influence when they are considered as riches which tomorrow shall be bestow'd upon another authority which shall this night expire for ever and praise which however merited or however sincere shall after a few moments be heard no more  IN those hours of seriousness and wisdom nothing appeared to raise his spirits or gladden his heart but the recollection of acts of  goodness nor to excite his attention but some opportunity for the exercise of the duties of religion Every thing that terminated on this side of the grave was received with coldness and indifference and regarded rather in consequence of the habit of valuing it than from any opinion that it deserved value it had little more prevalence over his mind than a bubble that was now broken a dream from which he was awake His whole powers were engrossed by the consideration of another state and all conversation was tedious that had not some tendency to disengage him from human affairs and open his prospects into eternity  IT is now past we have closed his eyes and heard him breathe the groan of expiration At the sight of this last conflict I felt a sensation never known to me before a confusion of passions an awful stilness of sorrow a gloomy terrour without a name The thoughts that entered my soul were too strong to be diverted and too piercing to be endured but such violence cannot be lasting the storm subsided in a short time I wept retired and grew calm  I have from that time frequently revolved in my mind the effects which the observation of death produces in those who are not wholly without the power and use of reflexion for by far the greater part it seems to be wholly unregarded Their friends and their enemies sink into the grave without raising any uncommon emotion or reminding them that they are themselves on the edge of the precipice and that they must soon plunge into the gulph of eternity  IT seems to me remarkable that death increases our veneration for the good and extenuates our hatred of the bad Those virtues which once we envied as Horace observes because they eclipsed our own can now no longer obstruct our reputation and we have therefore no interest to suppress their praise That wickedness which we feared for its malignity is now become impotent and the man whose name filled us with alarm and rage and indignation can at last be considered only with pity or contempt  WHEN a friend is carried to his grave we at once find excuses for every weakness and palliations  of every fault we recollect a thousand endearments which before glided off our minds without impression a thousand favours unrepaid a thousand duties unperformed and wish vainly wish for his return not so much that we may receive as that we may bestow happiness and recompense that kindness which before we never understood  THERE is not perhaps to a mind well instructed a more painful occurrence than the death of one whom we have injured without reparation Our crime seems now irretrieveable it is indelibly recorded and the stamp of fate is fixed upon it We consider with the most afflictive anguish the pain which we have given and now cannot alleviate and the losses which we have caused and now cannot compensate  OF the same kind are the emotions which the death of an emulator or competitor produces Whoever had qualities to alarm our jealousy had excellence to deserve our fondness and to whatever ardor opposition of interest may enflame us no man ever outlived an enemy whom he did not then wish to have made a friend Those who are versed in literary  history know that the elder Scaliger was the redoubted antagonist of Cardan and Erasmus yet at the death of each of his great rivals he relented and complained that they were snatched away from him before their reconciliation was completed  Tune etiam moreris Ah quid me linquis Erasme  Ante meus quam sit conciliatus amor  SUCH are the sentiments with which we at last review the effects of passion but which we sometimes delay till we can no longer rectify our errors Let us therefore make haste to do what we shall certainly at last wish to have done let us return the caresses of our friends and endeavour by mutual endearments to heighten that tenderness which is the balm of life Let us be quick to repent of injuries while repentance may not be a barren anguish and let us open our eyes to every rival excellence and pay early and willingly those honours which justice will compel us to pay at last  ATHANATUS  NUMB  TUESDAY  Sept    Maturo propior desine funeri  Inter ludere

had frequent opportunities of observing the little efficacy of remonstrance and complaint which however extorted by oppression or supported by reason are detested by one part of the world as rebellion censured by another as peevishness by another heard with an appearance of compassion only to betray any of those sallies of vehemence and resentment which are apt to break out upon encouragement and by others passed over with indifference and neglect as matters in which they have no concern and which if they should endeavour to examine or regulate they might  mischief upon themselves  YET since it is no less natural for those who think themselves injured to complain than for others to neglect their complaints I shall venture to lay my case before you in hopes that you will enforce my opinion if you think it just or endeavour to rectify my sentiments if I am mistaken I expect at least that you will divest yourself of partiality and that whatever your age or solemnity may be you will not with the dotard's insolence pronounce me ignorant and foolish perverse and refractory only because you perceive that I am young  MY father dying when I was but ten years old left me and a brother two years younger than myself to the care of my mother a woman of birth and education whose prudence or virtue he had no reason to distrust She felt for some time all the sorrow which nature calls forth upon the final separation of persons dear to one another and as her grief was exhausted by its own violence it subsided into tenderness for me and my brother and the year of mourning was spent in caresses consolations and instruction in celebration of my father's virtues in professions of perpetual regard to his memory and hourly instances  of such fondness as gratitude will not easily suffer me to forget  BUT when the term of this mournful felicity was expired and my mother appeared again without the ensigns of sorrow the ladies of her acquaintance began to tell her upon whatever motives that it was time to live like the rest of the world a powerful argument which is seldom used to a woman without effect Lady Giddy was incessantly relating the occurrences of the town and Mrs Gravely told her privately with great tenderness that it began to be publickly observed how much she overacted her part and that most of her acquaintance suspected her hope of procuring another husband to be the true ground of all that appearance of tenderness and piety  ALL the officiousness of kindness and folly was busied to change her conduct She was at one time alarmed with censure and at another fired with praise She was told of balls where others shone only because she was absent of new comedies to which all the town was crouding and of many ingenious ironies by which domestick diligence was made contemptibie  IT is difficult for virtue to stand alone against fear on one side and pleasure on the other especially when no actual crime is proposed and prudence itself can suggest many reasons for relaxation and indulgence My mamma was at last persuaded to accompany Miss Giddy to a play She was received with a boundless profusion of compliment and attended home by a very fine gentleman Next day she was with less difficulty prevailed on to play at Mrs Gravely's and came home gay and lively for the distinctions that had been paid her awakened her vanity and good luck had kept her principles of frugality from giving her disturbance She now made her second entrance into the world and her friends were sufficiently industrious to prevent any return to her former life every morning brought messages of invitation and every evening was passed in places of diversion from which she for some time complained that she had rather be absent In a short time she began to feel the happiness of acting without controul of being unaccountable for her hours her expences and her company and learned by degrees to drop an expression of contempt or pity at the mention of ladies whose husbands were suspected of restraining their pleasures or  their play and confessed that she loved to go and come as she pleased  I WAS still favoured with some incidental precepts and transient endearments and was now and then fondly kissed for smiling like my papa but most part of her morning was spent in comparing the opinion of her maid and milliner contriving some variation in her dress visiting shops and sending conpliments and the rest of the day was too short for visits cards plays and concerts  SHE now began to discover that it was impossible to educate children properly at home Parents could not have them always in their sight the society of servants was contagious company produced boldness and spirit emulation excited industry and a large school was naturally the first step into the open world A thousand other reasons she alleged some of little force in themselves but so well seconded by pleasure vanity and idleness that they soon overcame all the remaining principles of kindness and piety and both I and my brother were dispatched to boarding schools  HOW my mamma spent her time when she  was thus disburthened I am not able to inform you but I have reason to believe that trifles and amusements took still faster hold of her heart At first she visited me at school and afterwards wrote to me but in a short time both her visits and her letters were at an end and no other notice was taken of me than to remit money for my support  WHEN I came home at the vacation I found myself coldly received with an observation "that this girl will presently be a woman" I was after the usual stay sent to school again and overheard my mother say as I was a going "Well now I shall recover"  IN fix months more I came again and with the usual childish alacrity was running to my mother's embrace when she stopped me with exclamations at the suddenness and enormity of my growth having she said never seen any body shoot up so much at my age She was sure no other girls spread at that rate and she hated to have children look like women before their time I was disconcerted and retired without hearing any thing more than "Nay if you are angry madam Steeple you may walk off"  WHEN once the forms of civility are violated there remains little hope of return to kindness or decency My mamma made this appearance of resentment a reason for continuing her malignity and poor Miss Maypole for that was my appellation was never mentioned or spoken to but with some expression of anger or dislike  SHE had yet the pleasure of dressing me like a child and I know not when I should have been thought fit to change my habit had I not been rescued by a maiden sister of my father who could not bear to see women in hanging sleeves and therefore presented me with brocade for a gown for which I should have thought myself under great obligations had she not accompanied her favour with some hints that my mamma might now consider her age and give me her earrings which she had shewn long enough in publick places  I NOW left the school and came to live with my mamma who considered me as an usurper that had seized the rights of a woman without a just claim and was pushing her down the precipice of age that I might reign without  a superior While I am thus beheld with jealousy and suspicion you will readily believe that it is difficult to please Every word and look is an offence I never speak but I pretend to some qualities and excellences which it is criminal to possess if I am gay she thinks it early enough to coquette if I am grave she hates a prude in bibs if I venture into company I am in haste for a husband if I retire to my chamber such matronlike ladies are lovers of contemplation I am on one pretence or other generally excluded from her assemblies nor am I ever suffered to visit at the same place with my mamma Every one wonders why she does not bring Miss more into the world and when she comes home in vapours I am certain that she has heard either of my beauty or my wit and expect nothing for the ensuing week but taunts and menaces contradiction and reproaches  THUS I live in a state of continual persecution only because I was born ten years too soon and cannot stop the course of nature or of time but am unhappily a woman before my mother can willingly cease to be a girl I believe you would contribute to the happiness of many families if by any arguments  or persuasions you could make mothers ashamed of rivalling their children if you could shew them that though they may refuse to grow wise they must inevitably grow old and that the proper solaces of age are not musick and compliments but wisdom and devotion that those who are so unwilling to quit the world will soon be driven from it and that it is therefore their interest to retire while there yet remain a few hours for nobler employments  NUMB  SATURDAY  Sept    Valeat res ludicra si me  Palma negata macrum donata reducit opimum  HOR  NOTHING is more unpleasing than to find that others have received offence when none was intended and that pain has been given to those who were not guilty of any provocation As the great end of society is mutual beneficence a good man is always uneasy when he finds himself acting in opposition to the purposes of life because tho' his conscience may easily acquit him of  malice prepense  of settled hatred or contrivances of mischief  yet he seldom can be certain that he has not failed by negligence or indolence that he has not been hindered from consulting the common interest by too much regard to his own ease or too much indifference to the happiness of others  NOR is it necessary that to feel this uncasiness the mind should be extended to any great diffusion of generosity or melted by any uncommon warmth of benevolence for that prudence which rises from observation of the world and a quick sensibility of private interest will easily direct us to shun needless enmities since there is no man whose kindness we may not some time want or by whose malice we may not some time suffer  I HAVE therefore frequently looked with reaentment and wonder and now and then with pity at the thoughtlessness and folly with which some alienate from themselves the affections of all whom chance or business or inclination brings in their way When we see a man pursuing some darling interest without much regard to the opinion of the world though we may justly consider him as corrupt and dangerous we are not long in discovering  his motives we see him actuated by passions which are hard to be resisted and deluded by appearances which have dazzled stronger eyes But the greatest part of those who set mankind at defiance by hourly irritation and who live but to infuse malignity and multiply enemies have no hopes to foster no designs to promote nor any expectations of attaining power by insolence or of climbing to greatness by trampling on others They give up all the sweets of private kindness and all the satisfaction of general regard for the sake of peevishness petulance or gloom by neglect of the common forms of civility and breach of the established laws of conversation  EVERY one must in the walks of life have met with men of whom all speak with censure though they are not chargeable with any crime and whom none can be perswaded to love though no reason can be assigned why they should be hated and who if their good qualities and actions sometimes force a commendation have their panegyrick always concluded with confessions of disgust "he is a good man but I cannot like him" Surely such persons have sold the esteem of the world at too low a price since they have lost  one of the rewards of virtue without gaining the profits of wickedness  THIS ill economy of fame is sometimes the effect of stupidity Men whose perceptions are languid and sluggish who lament nothing but losses and feel nothing but a blow are often at a difficulty to guess by what means they have encompassed themselves with enemies though they lived in total neglect of all those arts by which men are endeared to one another They comfort themselves that they have lived irreproachably that none can charge them with having endangered his life or diminished his possessions and therefore conclude that they suffer by some invincible fatality or impute the malice of their neighbours to ignorance or envy They wrap themselves up in their innocence and enjoy the congratulations of their own hearts without knowing or suspecting that they are every day deservedly incurring resentments by withholding from those with whom they converse that regard or appearance of regard to which every one is entitled by the customs of the world  THERE are many injuries which almost  very man feels though he does not complain and which upon those whom virtue elegance or vanity have made delicate and tender fix deep and lasting impressions as there are many arts of graciousness and conciliation which are to be practised without expence and by which those may be made our friends who have never received from us any real benefit Such arts when they include neither guilt nor meanness it is surely reasonable to learn for who would want that love which is so easily to be gained And such injuries are to be avoided for who would be hated without profit  SOME indeed there are for whom the excuse of ignorance or negligence cannot be alleged because it is apparent that they are not only careless of pleasing but studious to offend that they contrive to make all approaches to them difficult and vexatious and imagine that they aggrandize themselves by wasting the time of others in useless attendance by mortifying them with slights and teazing them with affronts  Men of this kind are generally to be found among those that have not mingled much with  the general mass of the community but spent their lives amidst the obsequiousness of dependants and the flattery of parasites and have by long consulting only their own inclination forgotten that others have an equal claim to the same deference  TYRANNY thus avowed is indeed an exuberance of pride by which all mankind is so much enraged that it is never quietly endured except in those who can reward the patience which they exact and insolence is generally surrounded only by such whose baseness inclines them to think nothing insupportable that produces gain and who can laugh at scurrility and rudeness with a luxurious table and an open purse  BUT though all wanton provocations and contemptuous insolence are to be diligently avoided there is no less danger in timid compliance and tame resignation It is common for soft and fearful tempers to give themselve up implicitly to the direction of the bold the turbulent and the overbearing of those whom they do not believe wiser or better than themselves to recede from the best designs where  opposition must be encountered and to fall off from virtue for fear of censure  SOME firmness and resolution is necessary to the discharge of duty but it is a very unhappy state of life in which the necessity of such struggles frequently occurs for no man is defeated without some resentment which will be continued with obstinacy while he believes himself in the right and exerted with bitterness if even to his own conviction he is detected in the wrong and though no regard were to be had to the consequences of contrariety and dispute it must always be painful to a worthy mind to put others in pain and there will be some danger lest the kindest nature may be vitiated by too long a custom of debate and contest  I KNOW not whether I may not be taxed with insensibility by many of my correspondents who believe their contributions unjustly neglected And indeed when I sit before a pile of papers of which each is the production of laborious study and the offspring of a fond parent I who know the passions of an author cannot remember how long they have lain in my boxes unregarded without imagining  to myself the various changes of sorrow impatience and resentment which the writers must have felt in this tedious interval  THESE reflexions are still more awakened when upon perusal I find some of them calling for a place in the next paper a place which they have never yet obtained others writing in a style of superiority and haughtiness as secure of deference and above all fear of criticism others humbly offering their weak assistance with softness and submission which they believe impossible to be resisted some introducing their compositions with a menace of the contempt which he that refuses them will incur others applying privately to the booksellers for their interest and solicitation every one by different ways endeavouring to secure the bliss of publication I cannot but consider myself as placed in a very incommodious situation where I am forced to repress confidence which it is pleasing to indulge to repay civilities with appearances of neglect and so frequently to offend those by whom I never was offended  I KNOW well how rarely an author fired with the beauties of his new composition  contains his raptures in his own bosom and how naturally he imparts to his friends his expectations of renown and as I can easily conceive the eagerness with which a new paper is snatched up by one who expects to  it filled with his own production  perhaps has called his companions to  pleasure of a second  I  grieve for the disappointment  at the fatal inspection  however do not yet forsake him he is certain of giving lustre to the next day The next day comes and again he  with expectation and having dreamed of  and Parnassus cast his eyes upon the  page with which he is doomed never more to be delighted  FOR such cruelty what atonement can be made For such calamities what alleviation can be found I am afraid that the mischief already done must be without reparation and all that deserves  care is prevention for the future Let therefore the next friendly contributor whoever he be observe the cautions of  Swift  and  secretly in his own chamber without communicating his design to his nearest friend for the nearest friend will be pleased with an opportunity of laughing  Let him carry it to the post himself and wait in silence for the event If it is published and praised he may then declare himself the author if it be suppressed he may wonder in private without much vexation and if it be censured he may join in the cry and lament the dulness of the writing generation  NUMB  TUESDAY  October    Non intelligunt homines quam magnum vectigal sit parsimonia  TULL  To the RAMBLER  SIR  I AM always pleased when I see literature made useful and scholars descending from that elevation which as it raises them above common life must likewise hinder them from beholding the ways of men otherwise than in a cloud of bustle and confusion Having lived a life of business and remarked how seldom any occurrences emerge for which great qualities are required I have learned the necessity of regarding little things and though I do not pretend to give laws to the legislators  of mankind or to limit the range of those powerful minds that carry light and heat through all the regions of knowledge yet I have long thought that the greatest part of those who lose themselves in studies by which I have not found that they grow much wiser might with more advantage both to the publick and themselves apply their understandings to domestick arts and store their minds with axioms of humble prudence and private economy  YOUR late paper on frugality was very elegant and pleasing but in my opinion not sufficiently adapted to common readers who pay little regard to the musick of periods the artifice of connection or the arrangement of the flowers of rhetoric but require a few plain and cogent instructions which may sink into the mind by their own weight  FRUGALITY is so necessary to the happiness of the world so beneficial in its various forms to every rank of men from the highest of human potentates to the lowest labourer or artificer and the miseries which the neglect of it produces are so numerous and so grievous that it ought to be recommended  with every variation of address and adapted to every class of understanding  WHETHER those who treat morals as a science will allow frugality to be numbered among the virtues I have not thought it necessary to enquire For I who draw my opinions from a careful observation of the world am satisfied with knowing what is abundantly sufficient for practice that if it be not a virtue it is at least a quality which can seldom exist without some virtues and without which few virtues can exist Frugality may be termed the daughter of prudence the sister of temperance and the parent of liberty He that is extravagant will quickly become poor and poverty will enforce dependence and invite corruption it will almost always produce a passive compliance with the wickedness of others and there are few who do not learn by degrees to practise those crimes which they cease to censure  IF there are any who do not dread poverty as dangerous to virtue yet mankind seem unanimous enough in abhorring it as destructive to happiness and all to whom want is terrible upon whatever principle ought to  think themselves obliged to learn the sage maxims of our parsimonious ancestors and attain the salutary arts of contracting expence for without frugality none can be rich and with it very few would be poor  TO most other acts of virtue or exertions of wisdom a concurrence of many circumstances is necessary some previous knowledge must be attained some uncommon gifts of nature possessed or some opportunity produced by an extraordinary combination of things but the mere power of saving what is already in our hands must be easy of acquisition to every mind and as the example of Bacon may shew that the highest intellect cannot safely neglect it a thousand instances will every day prove that the meanest may practise it with success  RICHES cannot be within the reach of great numbers because to be rich is to possess more than is commonly placed in a single hand and if many could obtain the sum which now makes a man wealthy the name of wealth must then be transferred to still greater accumulations But I am not certain that it is equally impossible to exempt the lower classes  of mankind from poverty because though whatever be the wealth of the community some will always have least and he that has less than any other is comparatively poor yet I do not see any coactive necessity that many should be without the indispensable conveniencies of life but am sometimes inclined to imagine that casual calamities excepted there might by universal prudence be procured an universal exemption from want and that he who should happen to have least might notwithstanding have enough  BUT without entering too far into speculations which I do not remember that any political calculator has attempted and in which the most perspicacious reasoner may be easily bewildered it is certain that they to whom providence has allotted no other care but of their own fortune and their own virtue which make far the greater part of mankind have sufficient incitements to personal frugality since whatever might be its general effect upon provinces or nations by which it is never likely to be tried it is certain that there is scarcely any individual entering the world who by prudent parsimony may not reasonably  promise himself a chearful competence in the decline of life  THE prospect of penury in age is so gloomy and terrifying that every man who looks before him must resolve to avoid it and it must be avoided generally by the science of sparing For though in every age there are some who by bold adventures or by favourable accidents rise suddenly to riches yet it is dangerous to indulge hopes of such rare events And the bulk of mankind must owe their affluence to finall and gradual profits below which their expence must be resolutely reduced  YOU must not therefore think me sinking below the dignity of a practical philosopher when I recommend to the consideration of your readers from the statesman to the apprentice a position replete with mercantile wisdom  A penny saved is twopence got  which may I think be accommodated to all conditions by observing that not only they who pursue any lucrative employment will save time when they forbear expence and that the time may be employed to the encrease of prosit but they who are above such minute considerations  will find by every victory over appetite or passion new strength added to the mind will gain the power of refusing those solicitations by which the young and vivacious are hourly assaulted and in time set themselves above the reach of extravagance and solly  IT may perhaps be enquired by those who are willing rather to cavil than to learn what is the just measure of frugality and when expence not absolutely necessary degenerates into profusion To such questions no general answer can be returned since the liberty of spending or necessity of parsimony may be varied without end by different circumstances It may however be laid down as a rule never to be broken that  a man's voluntary expence should not exceed his revenue  A maxim so obvious and incontrovertible that the civil law ranks the prodigal with the madman and debars them equally from the conduct of their own affairs Another precept arising from the former and indeed included in it is yet necessary to be distinctly impressed upon the warm the fanciful and the brave  Let no man anticipate uncertain profits  Let no man presume to spend upon hopes to trust upon his own abilities for means of  deliverance from penury to give a loose to his present desires and leave the reckoning to fortune or to virtue  TO these cautions which I suppose are at least among the graver part of mankind undisputed I will add another  Let no man squander against his inclination  With this precept it may be perhaps imagined easy to comply yet if those whom profusion has buried in prisons or driven into banishment were examined it would be found that very few were ruined by their own choice or purchased pleasure with the loss of their estates but that they suffered themselves to be born away by the violence of those with whom they conversed and yielded reluctantly to a thousand prodigalities either from a trivial emulation of wealth and spirit or a mean fear of contempt and ridicule an emulation for the prize of folly or the dread of the laugh of fools  I am SIR Your Humble Servant SOPHRON  NUMB  SATURDAY  October    Improbae  Crescunt divitiae tamen  Curtae nescio quid semper abest rei  HOR  AS the love of money has been in all ages one of the passions that have given great disturbance to the tranquillity of the world there is no topick more copiously treated by the antient moralists than the folly of devoting the heart to the accumulation of riches they who are acquainted with these authors need not be told how riches incite pity contempt or reproach whenever they are mentioned with what numbers of examples the danger of large possessions is illustrated and how all the powers of reason and eloquence have been exhausted in a fruitless endeavour to eradicate a desire which seems to have intrenched itself too strongly in the mind to be driven out by argument or ridicule and which perhaps had not lost its power even over those who declaimed most vehemently against it but would have broken out in the poet or the sage if it had been excited by opportunity  and invigorated by the approximation of its proper object  THEIR arguments have been indeed so unsuccessful that I know not whether it can be shown that by all the wit and reason which this favourite cause has called forth a single convert was ever made that even one man has refused to be rich when to be rich was in his power from the conviction of the greater happiness of a narrow fortune or disburthened himself of wealth when he had tried its inquietudes merely to enjoy the peace and leisure and security of a mean and unenvied state  IT is true indeed that many have neglected opportunities of raising themselves to honours and to wealth and rejected the kindest offers of fortune but however their moderation may be boasted by themselves or admired by such as only view them at a distance it will be perhaps seldom found that they value riches less but that they dread labour or danger more than others they are unable to rouse themselves to action to strain in the race of competition or to stand the shock of contest but though they therefore decline  the toil of climbing they nevertheless wish themselves aloft and would willingly enjoy what they dare not seize  OTHERS have retired from high stations and voluntarily condemned themselves to privacy and obscurity but even these will not afford many occasions of triumph to the philosopher for they have commonly either quitted that only which they thought themselves unable to hold and prevented disgrace by resignation or they have been induced to try new measures by general inconstancy which always dreams of happiness in novelty or by a gloomy disposition which is disgusted in the same degree with every state and wishes every scene of life to change as soon as it is beheld such men found high and low stations equally unable to satisfy the wishes of a distempered mind and were unable to shelter themselves in the closest retreat from disappointment solicitude and misery  Yet though these admonitions have been thus neglected by those who either enjoyed riches or were able to procure them it is not rashly to be determined that they are altogether without use for since far the greatest  part of mankind must be confined to conditions comparatively mean and placed in situations from which they naturally look up with envy to the eminences before them those writers cannot be thought ill employed that have administered remedies to discontent almost universal by showing that what we cannot reach may very well be forborn that the inequality of distribution at which we murmur is for the most part less than it seems and that the greatness which we admire at a distance has much fewer advantages and much less splendor when we are suffered to approach it  IT is the business of moralists to detect the frauds of fortune and to show that she imposes upon the careless eye by a quick succession of shadows which will shrink to nothing in the gripe that she disguises life in extrinsick ornaments which can be of use only for show and are laid aside in the hours of solitude and of pleasure and that when greatness aspires either to felicity or to wisdom it shakes off as vain or cumbrous the chief part of those distinctions which are of use to dazzle the gazer and to awe the supplicant  IT may be remarked that they whose condition has not afforded them the light of moral or religious instruction and who collect all their ideas by their own eyes and digest them by their own understandings seem to consider those who are placed in ranks of remote superiority as almost another and higher species of beings and as themselves have known little other misery than the consequences of want they are with difficulty persuaded that where there is wealth there can be sorrow or that those who glitter in dignity and glide along in affluence can be acquainted with pains and cares like those which lie heavy upon the rest of mankind  THIS prejudice is indeed confined to the lowest meanness and the darkest ignorance but it is so confined only because others have been shown its folly and its falsehood because it has been opposed in its progress by history and philosophy and hindered from spreading its infection by powerful preservatives  THE doctrine of the contempt of wealth though it has not been wholly able to extinguish  avarice or ambition has certainly made them less importunate and overbearing and though it has not wholly suppressed that reluctance with which a man passes his days in a state of inferiority it must at least have made the lower conditions less grating and wearisome and has consequently contributed to the general security of life by hindering a great part of that fraud and violence rapine and circumvention which must have been produced by an unbounded eagerness of wealth arising from an unshaken conviction that to be rich is to be happy  WHOEVER finds himself incited by some violent impulse of passion to pursue riches as the chief end of being must surely be so much alarmed by the successive admonitions of those whose experience and sagacity have recommended them as the guides of mankind as to stop and consider whether he is about to engage in an undertaking that will reward his toil and to examine before he rushes to wealth through right and wrong what it will confer when he has acquired it and this examination will seldom fail to repress his ardor and retard his violence  WEALTH is nothing in itself it is not useful but when it departs from us its value is found only in that which it can purchase which if we suppose it put to its best use by those that possess it seems not much to deserve the desire or envy of a wise man It is certain that with regard to corporal enjoyment money can neither open new avenues to pleasure nor block up the passages of anguish Disease and infirmity still continue to torture and enfeeble perhaps exasperated by luxury or promoted by softness With respect to the mind it has rarely been observed that wealth contributes much to quicken the discernment enlarge the capacity or elevate the imagination but may by hiring flattery or laying diligence asleep confirm error and harden stupidity  WEALTH cannot confer greatness for nonothing can make that great which the decree of nature has ordained to be little The bramble may be placed in a hotbed but can never become an oak Even royalty itself is not able to give that dignity which it happens not to find but oppresses feeble minds though it may elevate the strong The world has  been governed in the name of kings whose existence has scarcely been perceived by any real effects beyond their own palaces  WHEN therefore the desire of wealth takes hold of the mind let us look round and see how it operates upon those whose industry or fortune has obtained it When we find them oppressed with their own abundance luxurious without pleasure idle without ease impatient and querulous in themselves and despised or hated by the rest of mankind we shall soon be convinced that if the real wants of our condition are satisfied there remains little to be sought with solicitude or desired with eagerness  NUMB  TUESDAY  Oct    Est aliquid fatale malum per verba levare  Hoc querulam Halcyonenque Prognen facit  Hoc erat in solo quare Paeantias antro  Vox fatigaret Lemnia saxa sua  Strangulat inclusus dolor atque exaestuat intus  Cogitur et vires multiplicare suas  OVID  IT is common to distinguish men by the names of animals which they are supposed to resemble Thus a hero is frequently termed a lion and a statesman a fox an extortioner gains the appellation of vultur and a fop the title of monkey There is also among the various anomalies of character which a survey of the world exhibits a species of beings in human form which may be properly marked out as the screechowls of mankind  THESE screechowls seem to be settled in an opinion that the great business of life is to complain and that they were born for no other purpose than to disturb the happiness of others to lessen the little comforts and shorten  the short pleasures of our condition by painful remembrances of the past or melancholy prognosticks of the future their only care is to crush the rising hope to damp the kindling transport and allay the golden hours of gayety with the hateful dross of grief and suspicion  TO those whose weakness of spirits or timidity of temper subjects them to impressions from others and who are apt to suffer by fascination and catch the contagion of misery it is extremely unhappy to live within the compass of a screechowl's voice for it will often fill their ears in the hour of dejection terrify them with apprehensions which their own thoughts would never have produced and sadden by intruded sorrows the day which might have been passed in amusements or in business it will fill the heart with unnecessary discontents and weaken for a time that love of life which is necessary to the vigorous prosecution of any undertaking  THOUGH I have like the rest of mankind many failings and weaknesses I have never yet by either friends or enemies been charged with superstition I never count the company  which I enter and I look at the new moon indifferently over either shoulder I have like most other philosophers often heard the cuckoo without money in my pocket and have been sometimes reproached as foolhardy for not turning down my eyes when a raven flew over my head I never go home abruptly because a snake crosses my way nor have any particular dread of a climacterical year yet I confess that with all my scorn of old women and their tales I consider it as an unhappy day when I happen to be greeted in the morning by Suspirius the screech owl  I HAVE now known Suspirius fifty eight years and four months and have never yet passed an hour with him in which he has not made some attack upon my quiet When we were first acquainted his great topick was the misery of youth without riches and whenever we walked out together he solaced me with a long enumeration of pleasures which as they were beyond the reach of my fortune were without the verge of my desires and which I should never have considered as the objects of a wish had not his unseasonable representations placed them in my sight  ANOTHER of his topicks is the neglect of merit with which he never fails to amuse every man whom he sees not eminently fortunate If he meets with a young officer he always informs him of gentlemen whose personal courage is unquestioned and whose military skill qualifies them to command armies that have notwithstanding all their merit grown old with subaltern commissions For a genius in the church he is always provided with a curacy for life The lawyer he informs of many men of great parts and deep study who have never had an opportunity to speak in the courts And meeting Serenus the physician "Ah doctor says he what afoot still when so many blockheads are rattling their chariots I told you seven years ago that you would never meet with encouragement and I hope you will now take more notice when I tell you that your  Greek  and your diligence and your honesty will never enable you to live like yonder apothecary who prescribes to his own shop and laughs at the physician"  SUSPIRIUS has in his time intercepted fifteen authors in their way to the stage persuaded  nine and thirty merchants to retire from a prosperous trade for fear of bankrupcy broke off an hundred and thirteen matches by prognostications of unhappiness and enabled the smallpox to kill nineteen ladies by perpetual alarms of the loss of beauty  WHENEVER my evil stars bring us together he never fails to represent to me the folly of my persuits and informs me that we are much older than when we began our acquaintance that the infirmities of decrepitude are coming fast upon me that whatever I now get I shall enjoy but a little time that fame is to a man tottering on the edge of the grave of very little importance and that the time is now at hand when I ought to look for no other pleasures than a good dinner and an easy chair  THUS he goes on in his unharmonious strain displaying present miseries and foreboding more  every syllable is loaded with misfortune and death is always brought nearer to the view Yet what always raises my resentment and indignation I do not perceive that his mournful meditations have much effect upon himself  He talks and has long talked of calamities without discovering otherwise than by the tone of his voice that he feels any of the evils which he bewails or threatens but has the same habit of uttering lamentations as others of telling stories and falls into expressions of condolence for past or apprehension of future mischiefs as all men studious of their ease have recourse to those subjects upon which they can most fluently or copiously discourse  IT is reported of the Sybarites that they destroyed all their cocks that they might dream out their morning dreams without disturbance Though I would not so far promote effeminacy as to propose the Sybarites for an example yet since there is no man so corrupt or foolish but something useful may be learned from him I could wish that in imitation of a people not often to be copied some regulations might be made to exclude screechowls from all company as the enemies of mankind and confine them to some proper receptacle where they may mingle sighs at leisure and thicken the gloom of one another  Thou prophet of evil says Homer  's  Agamemnon    thou never foretellest me good but the joy of thy heart is to predict misfortunes  Whoever is of the same temper might there find the means of indulging his thoughts and improving his vein of denunciation and the flock of screechowls might hoot together without injury to the rest of the world  YET though I have so little kindness for this dark generation I am very far from intending to debar the soft and tender mind from the privilege of complaining when the sigh rises from the desire not of giving pain but of gaining ease To hear complaints with patience even when complaints are vain is one of the duties of friendship and though it must be allowed that he suffers most like a hero that hides his grief in silence  Spem vultu simulat promit altum corde dolorem  yet it cannot be denied that he who complains acts like a man like a social being who looks for help from his fellowcreatures Pity is to many of the unhappy a source of comfort in hopeless distresses as it contributes to recommend them to themselves by proving that they have not lost the regard of others and heaven seems to indicate the duty even of  barren compassion by inclining us to weep for evils which we cannot remedy  NUMB  SATURDAY  Oct    Quid sit pulchrum quid turpe quid utile quid non  Plenius et melius Chrysippo et Crantore dicit  HOR  ALL joy or sorrow for the happiness or calamities of others is produced by an act of the imagination that realises the event however fictitious or approximates it however remote by placing us for a time in the condition of him whose fortune we contemplate so that we feel while the deception lasts' whatever motions would be excited by the same good or evil happening to ourselves  OUR passions are therefore more strongly moved in proportion as we can more readily adopt the pains or pleasure proposed to our minds by recognising them as once our own or considering them as naturally incident to our state of life It is not easy for the most  artful writer to give us an interest in happiness or misery which we think ourselves never likely to feel and with which we have never yet been made acquainted Histories of the downfall of kingdoms and revolutions of empires are read with great tranquilly it the imperial tragedy pleases common auditors only by its pomp of ornament and grandeur of ideas and the man whose faculties have been engrossed by business and whose heart never fluttered but at the rise or fall of stocks wonders how the attention can be seized or the affection agitated by a tale of love  THOSE parallel circumstances and kindred images to which we readily conform our minds are above all other writings to be found in narratives of the lives of particular persons and therefore no species of writing seems more worthy of cultivation than biography since none can be more delightful or more useful none can more certainly enchain the heart by irresistible interest or more widely diffuse instruction to every diversity of condition  THE general and rapid narratives of history  which involve a thousand fortunes in the business of a day and complicate innumerable incidents in one great transaction afford few lessons applicable to private life which derives its comforts and its wretchedness from the right or wrong management of things which nothing but their frequency makes considerable  Parva si non fiant quotidie  says Pliny and which can have no place in those relations which never descend below the consultation of senates the motions of armies and the schemes of conspirators  I HAVE often thought that there has rarely passed a life of which a judicious and faithful narrative would not be useful For not only every man has in the mighty mass of the world great numbers in the same condition with himself to whom his mistakes and miscarriages escapes and expedients would be of immediate and apparent use but there is such an uniformity in the state of man if it be considered apart from adventitious and separable decorations and disguises that there is scarce any possibility of good or ill but is common to humankind A great part of the time of those who are placed at the greatest distance by fortune or by temper must unavoidably  pass in the same manner and though when the claims of nature are satisfied caprice and vanity and accident begin to produce discriminations and peculiarities yet the eye is not very heedful or quick which cannot discover the same causes still terminating their influence in the same effects though sometimes accelerated sometimes retarded or perplexed by multiplied combinations We are all prompted by the same motives all deceived by the same fallacies all animated by hope obstructed by danger entangled by desire and seduced by pleasure  IT is frequently objected to relations of particular lives that they are not distinguished by any striking or wonderful vicissitudes The scholar who passes his life among his books the merchant who conducted only his own affairs the priest whose sphere of action was not extended beyond that of his duty are considered as no proper objects of publick regard however they might have excelled in their several stations whatever might have been their learning integrity and piety But this notion arises from false measures of excellence and dignity and must be eradicated by considering that in the esteem of uncorrupted  reason what is of most use is of most value  IT is indeed not improper to take honest advantages of prejudice and to gain attention by a celebrated name but the business of the biographer is often to pass slightly over those performances and incidents which produce vulgar greatness to lead the thoughts into domestick privacies and display the minute details of daily life where exterior appendages are cast aside and men excel each other only by prudence and by virtue The account of Thuanus is with great propriety said by its author to have been written that it might lay open to posterity the private and familiar character of that man  cujus ingenium et candorem ex ipsius scriptis sunt olim semper miraturi  whose candour and genius will to the end of time be by his writings preserved in admiration  THERE are many invisible circumstances which whether we read as enquiries after natural or moral knowledge whether we intend to enlarge our science or increase our virtue are more important than publick occurrences Thus Salust the great master has not forgot  in his account of Catiline to remark that  his walk was now quick    and again slow  as indications of a mind revolving something with violent commotion Thus the story of Melancthon affords a striking lecture on the value of time by informing us that when he made an appointment he expected not only the hour but the minute to be fixed that the day might not run out in the idleness of suspense and all the plans and enterprizes of De Wit are now of less importance to the world than that part of his personal character which represents him as careful of his health and negligent of his life  BUT biography has often been allotted to writers who seem very little acquainted with the nature of their task or very negligent about the performance They rarely afford any other account than might be collected from publick papers but imagine themselves writing a life when they exhibit a chronological series of actions or preferments and so little regard the manners or behaviour of their heroes that more knowledge may be gained of a man's real character by a short conversation with one of his servants than from a formal  and studied narrative begun with his pedigree and ended with his funeral  IF now and then they condescend to inform the world of particular facts they are not always so happy as to select those which are most important I know not well what advantage posterity can receive from the only circumstance by which Tickell has distinguished Addison from the rest of mankind the irregularity of his pulse nor can I think myself overpaid for the time spent in reading the life of Malherb by being enabled to relate after the learned biographer that Malherb had two predominant opinions one that the looseness of a single woman might destroy all her boast of ancient descent the other that the French beggars made use very improperly and barbarously of the phrase  noble Gentlemen  because either word included the sense of both  THERE are indeed some natural reasons why these narratives are often written by such as were not likely to give much instruction or delight and why most accounts of particular persons are barren and useless If a life be delayed till interest and envy are at an end and all motives to calumny or flattery are suppressed  we may hope for impartiality but must expect little intelligence for the incidents which give excellence to biography are of a volatile and evanescent kind such as soon escape the memory and are rarely transmitted by tradition We know how few can portray a living acquaintance except by his most prominent and observable particularities and the grosser features of his mind and it may be easily imagined how much of this little knowledge may be lost in imparting it and how soon a succession of copies will lose all resemblance of the original  IF the biographer writes from personal knowledge and makes haste to gratify the publick curiosity there is danger lest his interest his fear his gratitude or his tenderness overpower his fidelity and tempt him to conceal if not to invent There are many who think it an act of piety to hide the faults or sailings of their friends even when they can no longer suffer by their detection we therefore see whole ranks of characters adorned with uniform panegyrick and not to be known from one another but by extrinsick and casual circumstances "Let me remember says Hale when I find myself inclined  to pity a criminal that there is likewise a pity due to the country" If there is a regard due to the memory of the dead there is yet more respect to be paid to knowledge to virtue and to truth  NUMB  TUESDAY  Oct    Falsus honor juvat et mendax infamia terret  Quem nisi mendosum et mendacem  HOR  To the RAMBLER  SIR  IT is extremely vexatious to a man of eager and thirsty curiosity to be placed at a great distance from the fountain of intelligence and not only never to receive the current of report till it has satiated the greatest part of the nation but at last to find it mudded in its course and corrupted with some taints or mixtures from every channel through which it slowed  ONE of the chief pleasures of my life is to hear what passes in the world to know what  are the schemes of the politick the aims of the busy and the hopes of the ambitious what changes of publick measures are approaching who is likely to be crushed in the collision of parties who is climbing to the top of power and who is tottering on the precipice of disgrace But as it is very common for us to desire most what we are least qualified to obtain I have suffered this appetite of news to outgrow all the gratifications which my present situation can afford it for being placed in a remote country I am condemned always to confound the future with the past to form prognostications of events no longer doubtful and to consider the expediency of schemes already executed or defeated I am perplexed with a perpetual deception in my prospects like a man pointing his telescope at a remote star which before the light reaches his eye has forsaken the place from which it was emitted  THE mortification of being thus always behind the active world in my reflexions and discoveries is exceedingly aggravated by the petulance of those whose health or business or pleasure brings them hither from London  For without considering the insuperable disadvantages of my condition and the unavoidable ignorance which absence must produce they often treat me with the utmost superciliousness of contempt for not knowing what no human sagacity can discover and sometimes seem to consider me as a wretch scarcely worthy of human converse when I happen to talk of the fortune of a bankrupt or propose the healths of the dead when I warn them of mischiefs already incurred or wish for measures that have been lately taken They seem to attribute to the superiority of their intellects what they only owe to the accident of their condition and think themselves indisputably entitled to airs of insolence and authority when they find another ignorant of facts which because they echoed in the streets of London they suppose equally publick in all other places and known where they could neither be seen related nor conjectured  TO this haughtiness they are indeed too much encouraged by the respect which they receive amongst us for no other reason than that they come from London For no sooner is the arrival of one of these disseminators of  knowledge known in the country than we croud about him from every quarter and by innumerable enquiries flatter him into an opinion of his own importance He sees himself surrounded by multitudes who propose their doubts and refer their controversies to him as to a being descended from some nobler region and he grows on a sudden oraculous and infallible solves all difficulties and sets all objections at defiance  THERE is in my opinion great reason for suspecting that they sometimes take advantage of this reverential modesty and impose upon rustick understandings with a false show of universal intelligence for I do not find that they are willing to own themselves ignorant of any thing or that they dismiss any enquirer with a positive and decisive answer The court the city the park and exchange are to those men of unbounded observation equally familiar and they are alike ready to tell the hour at which stocks will rise or the ministry be changed  A SHORT residence at London entitles a man to knowledge to wit to politeness and to a despotick and dictatorial power of prescribing  to the rude multitude whom he condescends to honour with a biennial visit yet I know not well upon what motives I have lately found myself inclined to cavil at this prescription and to doubt whether it be not on some occasions proper to withold our veneration till we are more authentically convinced of the merits of the claimant  IT is well remember'd here that about seven years ago one Frolick a tall boy with lank hair remarkable for stealing eggs and sucking them was taken from the school in this parish and sent up to London to study the law As he had given amongst us no proofs of a genius designed by nature for extraordinary performances he was from the time of his departure totally forgotten nor was there any talk of his vices or virtues his good or his ill fortune till last summer a report burst upon us that Mr Frolick was come down in the first postchaise which this village had seen having travelled with such rapidity that one of his postilions had broke his leg and another narrowly escaped suffocation in a quicksand But that Mr Frolick seemed totally unconcerned for such things were never heeded at London  Mr FROLICK next day appeared among the gentlemen at their weekly meeting on the bowlinggreen and now were seen the effects of a London education His dress his language his ideas were all new and he did not much endeavour to conceal his contempt of every thing that differed from the opinions or practice of the modish world He shewed us the deformity of our skirts and sleeves informed us where hats of the proper size were to be sold and recommended to us the reformation of a thousand absurdities in our cloaths our cookery and our conversation When any of his phrases were unintelligible he could not suppress the joy of confessed superiority but frequently delayed the explanation that he might enjoy his triumph over our barbarity  WHEN he is pleased to entertain us with a story he takes care to croud into it names of streets squares and buildings with which he knows we are unacquainted The favourite topicks of his discourse are the pranks of runkards and the tricks put upon country gentlemen by porters and linkboys When he is with ladies he tells them of the innumerable  pleasures to which he can introduce them but never fails to hint how much they will be deficient at their first arrival in the knowledge of the town What it is  to know the town  he has not indeed hitherto informed us tho' there is no phrase so frequent in his mouth nor any science which he appears to think of so great value or so difficult attainment  BUT my curiosity has been most engaged by the recital of his own adventures and atchievements I have heard of the union of various characters in single persons but never met with such a constellation of great qualities as this man's narrative affords Whatever has distinguished the hero whatever has elevated the wit whatever has indeared the lover are all concentered in Mr Frolick whose life has for seven years been a regular interchange of intrigues dangers and waggeries and who has distinguished himself in every character that can be feared envied or admired  I QUESTION whether all the officers of the royal navy can bring together from all their journals a collection of so many wonderful escapes as this man has known upon the Thames on which he has been a thousand  and a thousand times on the point of perishing sometimes by the terrors of foolish women in the same boat sometimes by his own acknowledged imprudence in passing the river in the dark and sometimes by shooting the bridge under which he has rencountered mountainous waves and dreadful cataracts  NOR less has been his temerity by land nor fewer his hazards He has reeled with giddiness on the top of the monument he has crossed the street amidst the rush of coaches he has been surrounded by robbers with out number he has headed parties at the playhouse he has scaled the windows of every toast of whatever condition he has been hunted for whole winters by his rivals he has slept upon bulk he has cut chairs he has bilked coachmen he has rescued his friends from the bailiffs has knocked down the constable has bullied the justice and performed many other exploits that have filled the town with wonder and with merriment  BUT yet greater is the fame of his understanding than his bravery for he informs us that he is at London the established arbitrator of all points of honour and the decisive  judge of all performance of genius that no musical performer is in reputation till the opinion of Frolick has ratified his pretensions that the theatres suspend their sentence till he begins the clap or hiss in which all are proud to concur that no publick entertainment has failed or succeeded but because he opposed or favoured it that all controversies at the gamingtable are referred to his determination that he adjusts the ceremonial at every assembly and prescribes every fashion of pleasure or of dress  WITH every man whose name occurs in the papers of the day he is intimately acquainted and there are very few posts either in the state or army of which he has not more or less influenced the disposal He has been very frequently consulted both upon war and peace but the time is not yet come when the nation shall know how much it is indebted to the genius of Frolick  YET notwithstanding all these declarations I cannot hitherto persuade myself to see that Mr Frolick has more wit or knowledge or courage than the rest of mankind or that any uncommon enlargement of his faculties  has happened in the time of his absence For when he talks on subjects known to the rest of the company he has no advantage over us but by catches of interruption briskness of interrogation and pertness of contempt and therefore if he has stunned the world with his name and gained a place in the first ranks of humanity I cannot but conclude that either a little understanding confers eminence at London or that Mr Frolick thinks us unworthy of the exertion of his powers or that his faculties are benumbed by rural stupidity as the magnetick needle loses its animation in the polar climes  I WOULD not however like many hasty philosophers search after the cause till I am certain of the effect and therefore I desire to be informed whether you have yet heard the great name of Mr Frolick If he is celebrated by other tongues than his own I shall willingly propagate his praise but if he has swelled among us with empty boasts and honours conferred only by himself I shall treat him with rustick sincerity and drive him as an impostor from this part of the kingdom to some region of more credulity  I am c RURICOLA  NUMB  SATURDAY  Oct

customs of the polite part of mankind might long since have raised me to the highest honours of the female world but so strangely have they hitherto contrived to waste my life that I am now on the borders of twenty without having ever danced but at our monthly assembly or been toasted but among a few gentlemen of the neighbourhood or seen any company in which it was worth a wish to be distinguished  MY father having impaired his patrimony in soliciting a place at court at last grew wise enough to cease his persuit and to repair the consequences of expensive attendance and negligence of his affairs married a lady much older than himself who had lived in the fashionable world till she was considered as an encumbrance upon parties of pleasure and as I can collect from incidental informations retired from gay assemblies just time enough to escape the mortification of universal neglect  SHE was however still rich and not yet wrinkled my father was too distresfully embarrassed by the difficulty of his circumstances to think much on any thing but the means of extrication and though it is not likely that he wanted the delicacy which polite conversation will always produce in understandings not remarkably defective yet he was contented with a match by which he might be set free from inconveniencies that would have destroyed all the pleasures of imagination and taken from softness and beauty the power of delighting  AS they were both somewhat disgusted with their treatment in the world and married though without any dislike of each other yet principally for the sake of setting themselves free from dependance on caprice or fashion they soon retired into the country and devoted their lives to rural business and diversions  THEY had indeed not much reason to regret the change of their situation for their vanity which had so long been tormented by neglect and disappointment was here gratified with every honour that could with propriety be paid them Their long familiarity with publick life made them the oracles of all those who aspired to intelligence or politeness My father dictated politicks my mother prescribed the mode and it was sufficient to entitle any family to some consideration that they were known to visit at Mrs Courtly's  IN this state they were to speak in the style of novellists made happy by the stile of novellists made happy by the birth of your correspondent My parents had no other child I was therefore not browbeaten by a  cy brother or lost in a multitude of coheiresses  whose fortunes being equal would probably have conferred equal merit and procured equal regard and as my mother was now too old to dread a rival in her daughter my understanding and my person had fair play my enquiries were not check'd my advances towards importance were not repressed and I was soon suffered to tell my own opinions and early accustomed to hear my own praises  BY these accidental advantages I was so much exalted above the young ladies with whom I conversed and was treated by them with so much deference that I had all the gratifications which pride can demand I saw none who did not seem to confess my superiority and to be held in awe by the splendour of my appearance for the fondness of my father made himself pleased to see me dressed and my mother had no vanity nor expences to hinder her from concurring with his inclinations  THUS Mr Rambler I lived without much desire after any thing beyond the circle of our visits and here I should have quietly continued to portion out my time among my books and my needle and my company had not my curiosity been every moment excited by  the conversation of my parents who whenever they sit down to familiar prattle and endeavour the entertainment of each other immediately transport themselves to London and relate some adventure in a hackney coach some frolick at a masquerade some conversation in the park or some quarrel at an assembly display the magnificence of a birthnight relate the conquests of maids of honour or give a history of diversions shows and entertainments which I had never known but from their accounts  I AM so well versed in the history of the gay world that I can relate with great punctuality the lives of all the last race of wits and beauties can enumerate with exact chronology the whole succession of celebrated singers musicians tragedians comedians and harlequins can tell to the last twenty years all the changes of fashions and am indeed a complete antiquary with respect to headdresses dances and operas  YOU will easily imagine Mr Rambler that I could not hear these narratives for sixteen years together without suffering some impression and wishing myself nearer to those scenes  of perpetual novelty to places where every hour brings some new pleasure and life is diversified with an unexhausted succession of felicity  I INDEED often asked my mother why she left a place which she recollected with so much delight and why she did not visit London once a year like some other ladies and initiate me in the world by showing me it amusements its grandeur and its variety But she always told me that the days which she had seen were such as will never come again that all diversion is now degenerated that the conversation of the present age is insipid that their fashions are unbecoming their customs absurd and their morals corrupt that there is no ray left of the genius which enlightened the times that she remembers that no one who had seen or heard the ancient performers would be able to bear the bunglers of this despicable age and that there is now neither politeness nor pleasure nor virtue in the world She therefore assures me that she consults my happiness by keeping me at home for I should now find nothing but vexation and disgust and she  should be ashamed to see me pleased with such fopperies and trifles as take up the thoughts of the present set of young people  WITH this answer I was kept quiet for several years and thought it no great inconvenience to be confined to the country till last summer a young gentleman and his sister came down to pass a few months with one of our neighbours They had generally no great regard for the country ladies but distinguished me by particular complaisance and as we grew intimate gave me such a detail of the elegance the splendour the mirth the happiness of the town that I am resolved to be no longer buried in ignorance and obscurity but to share with other wits the joy of being admired and divide with other beauties the empire of the world  I DO not find Mr Rambler upon a deliberate and impartial comparison that I am excelled by Belinda in beauty in wit in judgement in knowledge or in any thing but a kind of gay lively familiarity by which she mingles with strangers as with persons long acquainted and which enables her to display her powers without any obstruction hesitation  or confusion Yet she can relate a thousand civilities paid to her in publick can produce from a hundred lovers letters filled with praises protestations extasies and despair has been handed by dukes to her chair has been the occasion of innumerable quarrels has paid twenty visits in an afternoon been invited to sixballs in an evening and been forced to retire to lodgings in the country from the importunity of courtship and the fatigue of pleasure  I TELL you Mr Rambler I will stay here no longer I have at last prevailed upon my mother to send me to town and shall set out in three weeks on the grand expedition I intend to live in publick and to croud into the winter every pleasure which money can purchase and every honour which beauty can obtain  BUT this tedious interval how shall I endure Cannot you alleviate the misery of delay by some pleasing description of the entertainments of the town I can read I can talk I can think of nothing else and if you will not sooth my impatience heighten my ideas and animate my hopes you may write for those  who have more leisure but are not to expect any longer the honour of being read by those eyes which are now intent only on conquest and destruction  RHODOCLIA  NUMB  TUESDAY  October    Habebat saepe ducentos  Saepe decem servos modo reges atque tetrarchas  Omnia magna loquens modo sit mihi mensa tripes et  Concha falis puri et toga quae defendere frigus  Quamvis crassa queat  HOR  IT has been remarked perhaps by every writer who has lest behind him observations upon life that no man is pleased with his present state which proves equally unsatisfactory says Horace whether fallen upon by chance or chosen with deliberation we are always disgusted with some circumstance or other of our situation and imagine the condition of others more abundant in blessings or less exposed to calamities  THIS universal discontent has been generally mentioned with great severity of censure as unreasonable in itself since of two equally envious of each other both cannot have the larger share of happiness and as tending to darken life with unnatural and unnecessary gloom by withdrawing our minds from the contemplation and enjoyment of that happiness which our state affords us and fixing our attention upon foreign objects which we only behold to depress ourselves and increase our misery by injurious comparisons  WHEN this opinion of the happiness of others predominates in the heart so as to excite resolutions of obtaining at whatever price the condition to which such transcendent privileges are supposed to be annexed when it bursts into action and produces fraud violence and injustice it is without doubt to be persued wiih all the rigour of legal punishments But while it only operates upon the thoughts and disturbs none but him who has happened to admit it and however it may interrupt content makes no attack on piety or virtue I cannot think it so far criminal  or ridiculous but that it may deserve some pity and admit some excuse  THAT all are equally happy or miserable I suppose none is sufficiently enthusiastical to maintain because though as it has been often objected we cannot judge of the condition of others yet every man has found frequent vicissitudes in his own state and must therefore be convinced that life is susceptible of more or less felicity What then shall forbid us to endeavour the alteration of that which we find capable of being improved and to grasp at augmentations of good when we know it possible to be increased and believe that any particular change of situation will increase it  IF he that finds himself uneasy may reasonably make efforts to rid himself from vexation all mankind have a sufficient plea for some degree of restlessness and the fault seems to be little more than too much temerity of conclusion in favour of something not yet experienced and too much readiness to believe' that the misery which our own passions and appetites produce is brought upon us by accidental causes and external efficients  IT is indeed frequently discovered by us that we have complained too hastily of peculiar hardships and have imagined ourselves distinguished by embarrassments with which other classes of men are equally entangled We often change a lighter for a greater evil and wish ourselves restored again to the state from which we thought it desirable to be delivered But this knowledge though it is easily gained by the trial is not always attainable any other way and that error cannot justly be reproached which reason could not obviate nor prudence avoid  TO take a view at once distinct and comprehensive of human life with all its intricacies of combination and varieties of connexion is beyond the power of mortal intelligences Of the state with which practice has not acquainted us we snatch a glimpse we discern a point and regulate the rest by passion and by fancy In this enquiry every favourite prejudice every innate desire is busy to deceive us We are unhappy at least less happy than our nature seems to admit we necessarily desire the melioration of our lot what we desire we very reasonably seek and  what we seeck we are naturally eager to believe that we have sound Our confidence is indeed often disappointed but our reason is not convinced and there is no man who does not hope for something which he has not though perhaps his wishes lie unactive because he foresees the difficulty of attainment As among the numerous students of Hermetick philosophy not one appears to have desisted from the task of transmutation from conviction of its impossibility but from weariness of toil or impatience of delay a broken body or exhausted fortune  IRRESOLUTION and mutability are often the faults of men whose views are wide and whose imagination is vigorous and excursive because they cannot confine their thoughts within their own boundaries of action but are continually ranging over all the seenes of human existence and consequently are often apt to conceive that they fall upon new regions of pleasure and start new possibilities of happiness Thus they are too often busied with a perpetual succession of schemes and pass their lives in alternate elation and sorrow for want of that calm and immovable acquiescence in their condition by which men of flower  understandings are fixed for ever to a certain point or led on in the plain beaten track which their fathers and grandsires have trod before them  OF two conditions of life equally inviting to the prospect that will always have the disadvantage which we have already tried because the evils which we have felt we cannot extenuate and though we have perhaps from nature the power as well of aggravating the calamity which we fear as of heightening the blessing we expect yet in those meditations which we indulge by choice and which are not forced upon the mind by necessity we have always the art of fixing our regard upon the more pleasing images and suffer hope to dispose the lights by which we look upon futurity  THE good and ill of different modes of life are sometimes so equally opposed that perhaps no man ever yet made his choice between them upon a full conviction and adequate knowledge and therefore fluctuation of will is not more wonderful when they are proposed to the election than oscillations of a beam charged with equal weights The mind no  sooner imagines itself determined by some prevalent advantage than some convenience of equal weight is discovered on the other side and the resolutions which are suggested by the nicest examination are often repented as soon as they are taken  EUMENES a young man of great abilities inherited a very large estate from a father who had been long eminent in the most conspicuous employments His father harrassed with frequent competitions and perplexed with multiplicity of business very earnestly recommended to him the quiet and security of a private station and impressed his persuasions with so much force that Eumenes for some years resisted every motion of ambitious wishes but being once provoked by the sight of oppression and injustice which he could not redress he began to think it the duty of an honest man to enable himself to protect others and gradually felt a desire of greatness excited by a thousand projects of advantage to his country His fortune immediately placed him in the senate his knowledge and eloquence soon advanced him at court and he possessed that authority and influence which he had resolved to exert for the happiness of mankind  HE now became acquainted with the embarrassments of greatness and was in a short time convinced that in proportion as the power of doing well was enlarged the temptations to do ill were multiplied and enforced He felt himself every moment in danger of being either seduced or driven from his honest purposes Sometimes a friend was to be gratified and sometimes a rival to be crushed by means which his conscience could not approve Sometimes he was forced to comply with the prejudices of the publick and sometimes with the schemes of the ministry He was by degrees wearied with perpetual struggles to unite policy and virtue and went back to retirement as the shelter of innocence persuaded that he could only hope to benefit mankind by a blameless example of private virtue Here he spent some years in tranquillity and beneficence but finding that corruption increased and false opinions in government prevailed he thought himself again summoned to posts of publick trust from which new evidence of his own weakness again determined him to retire  THUS men may be made inconstant by  virtue and by vice by too much or too little thought yet inconstancy however dignified by its motives is always to be avoided because life allows us but a small time for enquiry and experiment and he that steadily endeavours at excellence in whatever employment will more benefit mankind than he that hesitates in choosing his part till he is called to the performance The traveller that resolutely follows a rough and winding path will sooner reach the end of his journey than he that is always changing his direction and wastes the hours of daylight in looking for smoother ground and shorter passages  NUMB  SATURDAY  Oct    Idem velle et idem nolle ea demum firma amicitia est  SALUST  WHEN Socrates was building himself a house at Athens being asked by one that observed the littleness of the design why a man so eminent would not have an abode more suitable to his dignity he replied that he should think himself sufficiently accommodated  if he could see that narrow habitation filled with real friends Such was the opinion of this great master of human life concerning the infrequency of such an union of minds as might deserve the name of friendship that among the multitudes whom vanity or curiosity civility or veneration crouded about him he did not expect that very spacious apartments would be necessary to contain all that should regard him with sincere kindness or adhere to him with steady fidelity  SO many qualities are indeed requisite to the possibility of friendship and so many accidents must concur to its rise and its continuance that no wonder can be excited by observing that the greatest part of mankind content themselves without it and supply its place as they can with interest and dependance  MULTITUDES are unqualified for a constant and warm reciprocation of benevolence as they are incapacitated for any other elevated excellence by a perpetual attention to their interest and an unresisting subjection to their passions An inability may be superinduced by long habits of denying any desire or of repressing by superior motives the importunities  of any immediate gratification and an inveterate selfishness will imagine all advantages diminished in proportion as they are communicated  BUT not only this hateful and confirmed corruption but many varieties of disposition not inconsistent with common degrees of virtue may exclude friendship from the heart Some ardent enough in their benevolence and defective neither in officiousness nor liberality are mutable and uncertain soon attracted by new objects disgusted without offence and alienated without enmity Others are soft and flexible easily influenced by reports or whispers ready to catch alarms from every dubious circumstance and to listen to every suspicion which envy and flattery shall suggest to follow the opinion of every confident adviser and move by the impulse of the last breath Some are impatient of contradiction more willing to go wrong by their own judgment than to be indebted for a better or a safer way to the sagacity of another inclined to consider counsel as insult and enquiry as want of confidence and to confer their regard on no other terms than unreserved submission and implicit compliance Some  are dark and involved equally careful to conceal good and bad purposes and pleased with producing effects by invisible means and shewing their design only in its execution Others are universally communicative alike open to every eye and equally profuse of their own secrets and those of others without the necessary vigilance of caution or the honest arts of prudent integrity ready to accuse without malice and to betray without treachery Any of these may be useful to the community and pass through the world with the reputation of good purposes and uncorrupted morals but they are unfit for close and tender intimacies He cannot properly be chosen for a friend whose kindness is exhaled by its own warmth or frozen by the first blast of slander he cannot be a useful counsellor who will hear no opinion but his own he will not much invite confidence whose principal maxim is to suspect nor can the candour and frankness of that man be much esteemed who spreads his arms to human kind and makes every man without distinction a denizon of his bosom  THAT friendship may be at once fond and lasting there must not only be equal virtue on  each part but virtue of the same kind not only the same end must be proposed but the same means must be approved by both We are often by superficial accomplishments and accidental endearments induced to love those whom we cannot esteem we are sometimes by great abilities and incontestable evidences of virtue compelled to esteem those whom we cannot love But friendship compounded of esteem and love derives from one its tenderness and its permanence from the other and therefore requires not only that its candididates should gain the judgment but that they should attract the affections that they should not only be firm in the day of distress but gay in the hour of jollity not only useful in exigences but pleasing in familiar life their presence should give chearfulness as well as courage and dispel alike the gloom of fear and of melancholy  TO this mutual complacency is generally requisite an uniformity of opinions at least of those active and conspicuous principles which discriminate parties in government and sects in religion and which every day operate more or less on the common business of life For though great tenderness has perhaps been  sometimes known to continue between men eminent in contrary factions yet such friends are to be shewn rather as prodigies than examples and it is no more proper to regulate our conduct by such instances than to leap a precipice because some have fallen from it and escaped with life  IT cannot but be extremely difficult to preserve private kindness in the midst of publick opposition in which will necessarily be involved a thousand incidents extending their influence to conversation and privacy Men engaged by moral or religious motives in contrary parties will generally look with different eyes upon every man and decide almost every question upon different principles When such occasions of dispute happen to comply is to betray our cause and to maintain friendship by ceasing to deserve it to be silent is to lose the happiness and dignity of independence to live in perpetual constraint and to desert if not to betray and who shall determine which of two friends shall yield where neither believes himself mistaken and both confess the importance of the question What then remains but contradiction and debate  and from those what can be expected but acrimony and vehemence the insolence of triumph the vexation of defeat and in time a weariness of contest and an extinction of benevolence Exchange of endearments and intercourse of civility may continue indeed as boughs may for a while be verdant when the root is wounded but the poison of discord is infused and though the countenance may preserve its smile the heart is hardening and contracting  THAT man will not be long agreeable whom we see only in times of seriousness and severity and therefore to maintain the softness and serenity of benevolence it is necessary that friends partake each others pleasures as well as cares and be led to the same diversions by similitude of taste This is however not to be considered as equally indispensable with conformity of principles because any man may honestly according to the precepts of Horace resign the gratifications of taste to the humour of another and friendship may well deserve the sacrifice of pleasure though not of conscience  IT was once ingenuously confessed to me  by a painter that no professor of his art ever loved another This declaration is so far justified by the knowledge of life as to damp the hopes of warm and constant friendship between men whom their studies have made competitors and whom every favourer and every censurer are hourly inciting against each other The utmost expectation that experience can warrant is that they should forbear open hostilities and secret machinations and when the whole fraternity is attacked be able to unite against a common soe Some however though few may perhaps be found in whom emulation has not been able to overpower generosity who are distinguished from lower beings by nobler motives than the love of fame and can preserve the sacred flame of friendship from the gusts of pride and the rubbish of interest  FRIENDSHIP is seldom lasting but between equals or where the superiority on one side is reduced by some equivalent advantage on the other Benefits which cannot be repaid and obligations which cannot be discharged are not commonly sound to increase affection they excite gratitude indeed and heighten vencration  but commonly take away that easy freedom and familiarity of intercourse without which though there may be fidelity and zeal and admiration there cannot be friendship Thus imperfect are all earthly blessings the great effect of friendship is beneficence yet by the first act of uncommon kindness it is endangered like plants that bear their fruit and die Yet this consideration ought not to restrain bounty or repress compassion for duty is to be preferred before convenience and he that loses part of the pleasures of friendship by his generosity gains in its place the gratulation of his conscience  NUMB  TUESDAY  October    Garrit aniles  Ex refabellas  HOR  OBIDA the son of Abensina left the caravansera early in the morning and persued his journey through the plains of Indostan He was fresh and vigorous with rest he was animated with hope he was incited by desire he walked swiftly forward  over the vallies and saw the hills gradually rising before him As he passed along his ears were delighted with the morning song of the bird of paradise he was fanned by the last flutters of the sinking breeze and sprinkled with dew by groves of spices he sometimes contemplated the towering height of the oak monarch of the hills and sometimes caught the gentle fragrance of the primrose eldest daughter of the spring all his senses were gratified and all care was banished from his heart  THUS he went on till the sun approached his meridian and the increasing heat preyed upon his strength he then looked round about him for some more commodious path He saw on his right hand a grove that seemed to wave its shades as a sign of invitation he entered it and found the coolness and verdure irresistibly pleasant He did not however forget whither he was travelling but found a narrow way bordered with flowers which appeared to have the same direction with the main road and was pleased that by this happy experiment he had found means to unite pleasure with business and to gain the rewards of diligence without suffering its fatigues  He therefore still continued to walk for a time without the least remission of his ardour except that he was sometimes tempted to stop by the musick of the birds whom the heat had assembled in the shade and sometimes amused himself with plucking the flowers that covered the banks on either side or the fruits that hung upon the branches At last the green path began to decline from its first tendency and to wind among hills and thickets cooled with fountains and murmuring with waterfalls Here Obidah paused for a time and began to consider whether it were longer safe to forsake the known and common track but remembering that the heat was now in its greatest violence and that the plain was dusty and uneven he resolved to persue the new path which he supposed only to make a few meanders in compliance with the varieties of the ground and to end at last in the common road  HAVING thus calmed his solicitude he renewed his pace though he suspected that he was not gaining ground This uneasiness of his mind inclined him to lay hold on every new object and give way to every sensation that might sooth or divert him He listened  to every echo he mounted every hill for a fresh prospect he turned aside to every cascade and pleased himself with tracing the course of a gentle river that rolled among the trees and watered a large region with innumerable circumvolutions In these amusements the hours passed away uncounted his deviations had perplexed his memory and he knew not towards what point to travel He stood pensive and confused afraid to go forward lest he should go wrong yet conscious that the time of loitering was now past While he was thus tortured with uncertainty the sky was overspread with clouds the day vanished from before him and a sudden tempest gathered round his head He was now roused by his danger to a quick and painful remembrance of his folly he now saw how happiness is lost when ease is consulted he lamented the unmanly impatience that prompted him to seek shelter in the grove and despised the petty curiosity that led him on from trifle to trifle While he was thus reflecting the air grew blacker and a clap of thunder broke his meditation  HE now resolved to do what remained yet in his power to tread back the ground which  he had passed and try to find some issue where the wood might open into the plain He prostrated himself on the ground and commended his life to the lord of nature He rose with confidence and tranquillity and pressed on with his sabre in his hand for the beasts of the desart were in motion and on every hand were heard the mingled howls of rage and fear and ravage and expiration all the horrors of darkness and solitude surrounded him the winds roared in the woods and the torrents tumbled from the hills  THUS forlorn and distressed he wandered through the wild without knowing whither he was going or whteher he was every moment drawing nearer to safety or to destruction At length not fear but labour began to overcome him his breath grew short and his knees crembled and he was on the point of lying down in resignation to his fate when he beheld through the brambles the glimmer of a taper He advanced towards the light and finding that it proceeded from the cottage of a hermit he called humbly at the door  and obtained admission The old man set before him such provisions as he had collected for himself on which Obidah fed with eagerness and gratitude  WHEN the repast was over "Tell me said the hermit by what chance thou hast been brought hither I have been now twenty years an inhabitant of the wilderness in which I never saw a man before" Obidah then related the occurrences of his journey without any concealment or palliation  "SON said the hermit let the errors and follies the dangers and escape of this day sink deep into thy heart Remember my son that human life is the journey of a day We rise in the morning of youth full of vigour and full of expectation we set forward with spirit and hope with gaiety and with diligence and travel on a while in the streight road of piety towards the mansions of rest In a short time we remit our fervor and endeavour to find some mitigation of our duty and some more easy means of obtaining the same end  We then relax our vigour and resolve no longer to be terrified with crimes at a distance but rely upon our own constancy and venture to approach what we resolve never to touch We thus enter the bowers of ease and repose in the shades of security Here the heart softens and vigilance subsides we are then willing to enquire whether another advance cannot be made and whether we may not at least turn our eyes upon the gardens of pleasure We approach them with scruple and hesitation we enter them but enter timorous and trembling and always hope to pass through them without losing the road of virtue which we for a while keep in our sight and to which we purpose to return But temptation succeeds temptation and one compliance prepares us for another we in time lose the happiness of innocence and solace our disquiet with sensual gratifications By degrees we let fall the remembrance of our original intention and quit the only adequate object of rational desire We entangle ourselves in business immerge ourselves in luxury and rove through the labyrinths of inconstancy till the darkness of old age begins to invade  us and disease and anxiety obstruct our way We then look back upon our lives with horror with sorrow with repentance and wish but too often vainly wish that we had not forsaken the ways of virtue Happy are they my son who shall learn from thy example not to despair but shall remember that though the day is past and their strength is wasted there yet remains one effort to be made that reformation is never hopeless nor sincere endeavours ever unassisted that the wanderer may at length return after all his errors and that he who implores strength and courage from above shall find danger and difficulty give way before him Go now my son to thy repose commit thyself to the care of omnipotence and when the morning calls again to toil begin a new thy journey and thy life"  NUMB  SATURDAY  November    Pauci dignoscere possunt  Vera bona atque illis multum diversa remotâ  Erroris nebulâ  JUV  THE folly of human wishes and persuits has always been a standing subject of mirth and declamation and has been ridiculed and lamented from age to age till perhaps the fruitless repetition of complaints and censures may be justly numbered among the subjects of censure and complaint  SOME of these instructors of mankind have not contented themselves with checking the overflows of passion and lopping the exuberance of desire but have attempted to destroy the root as well as the branches and not only to confine the mind within bounds but to smooth it forever by a dead calm They have employed their reason and their eloquence to persuade us that nothing is worth the wish of a wise man have represented all earthly good and evil as indifferent and counted among vulgar errors the dread of pain and the love of life  IT is almost always the unhappiness of a victorious disputant to destroy his own authority by claiming too many consequences or diffusing his proposition to an indefensible extent When we have heated our zeal in a cause and elated our confidence with success we are naturally inclined to persue the same train of reasoning to establish some collateral truth to remove some adjacent difficulty and to take in the whole comprehension of our system As a prince in the ardour of acquisition is willing to secure his first conquest by the addition of another add fortress to fortress and city to city till despair and opportunity turn his enemies upon him and he loses in a moment the glory of a reign  THE philosophers having found an easy victory over those desires which we produce in ourselves and which terminate in some imaginary state of happiness unknown and unattainable proceeded to make further inroads upon the heart and attacked at last our senses and our instincts They continued to war upon nature with arms by which only folly could be conquered they therefore lost the trophies of their former combats and were  considered no longer with reverence or regard  YET it cannot be with justice denied that these men have been very useful monitors and have left many proofs of strong reason deep penetration and accurate attention to the affairs of life which it is now our business to separate from the foam of a boiling imagination and to apply judiciously to our own use They have shewn that most of the conditions of life which raise the envy of the timorous and rouse the ambition of the daring are empty shows of felicity which when they become familiar lose their power of delighting and that the most prosperous and exalted have very few advantages over a meaner and more obscure fortune when their dangers and solicitudes are balanced against their equipage their banquets and their palaces  IT is natural for every man uninstructed and unenlightened to murmur at his condition because in the general infelicity of life he feels his own miseries without knowing that they are common to all the rest of the species and therefore though he will not be less sensible of pain by being told that others are equally  tormented he will at least be freed from the temptation of seeking by perpetual changes that ease which is no where to be found and though his disease still continues he escapes the hazard of exasperating it by remedies  THE gratifications which affluence of wealth extent of power and eminence of reputation confer must be always by their own nature confined to a very small number and the life of the greater part of mankind must be lost in empty wishes and painful comparisons were not the balm of philosophy shed upon us and our discontent at the appearances of unequal distribution soothed and appeased  IT seemed perhaps below the dignity of the great masters of moral learning to descend to familiar life and caution mankind against that petty ambition which is known among us by the name of vanity which yet had been an undertaking not unworthy of the longest beard and most solemn austerity For though the passions of little minds acting in low stations do not fill the world with bloodshed and devastations or mark by great events the periods of time yet they torture  the breast which they happen to seize infest those that are placed within the reach of their influence destroy private quiet and private virtue and undermine insensibly the happiness of the world  THE desire of excellence is laudable but is very frequently ill directed We fall by chance into some class of mankind and without consulting nature or wisdom resolve to gain their regard by those qualities which they happen to esteem I once knew a man remarkably dimsighted who by conversing much with country gentlemen found himself irresistibly determined to sylvan honours and was very desirous to be thought a skilful sportsman His great ambition was to shoot flying and he therefore spent whole days in the woods persuing game which before he was near enough to see them his approach always frighted away  WHEN it happens that the desire tends to objects which produce no competition it may be overlooked with some indulgence because however fruitless or absurd it cannot have ill effects upon the morals But most of our enjoyments owe their value to the peculiarity of  possession and when they are rated at too high a value give occasion to stratagems of malignity and incite opposition hatred and defamation The contest of two rural beauties for preference and distinction is often sufficiently keen and rancorous to fill their breasts with all those passions which are generally thought the curse only of senates of armies and of courts and the rival dancers of an obscure assembly have their partisans and abettors often not less exasperated against each other than those who are promoting the interests of rival monarchs  IT is common to consider those whom we find infected with an unreasonable regard for trifling accomplishments as justly chargeable with all the consequences of their folly and as the authors of their own unhappiness but perhaps those whom we thus scorn or detest have more claim to tenderness than has been yet allowed them Before we permit our severity to break loose upon any fault or error we ought surely to consider how much we have countenanced or promoted it We see multitudes busy in the persuit of riches at the expence of wisdom and of virtue but we see the rest of mankind approving their conduct  and inciting their eagerness by paying that regard and deference to wealth which wisdom and virtue only can deserve We see women universally jealous of the reputation of their beauty and frequently look with contempt on the care with which they study their complexions endeavour to preserve or to supply the bloom of youth regulate every ornament twist their hair into curls and shade their faces from the weather We often recommend to them the care of their nobler part and tell them how little addition is made by all their arts to the graces of the mind But when was it known that female virtue or knowledge was able to attract that officiousness or inspire that ardour which beauty produces whenever it appears And with what hope can we endeavour to persuade the ladies that the time spent at the toilet is lost in vanity when they have every moment some new conviction that their interest is more effectually promoted by a ribband well disposed than by the brightest act of heroick virtue  IN every instance of vanity it will be found that the blame ought to be shared among more than it generally reaches all who exalt trifles by immoderate praise or instigate needless  emulation by invidious incitements are to be considered as perverters of reason and corrupters of the world and since every man is obliged to promote happiness and virtue he should be careful not to mislead unwary minds by appearing to set too high a value upon things by which no real excellence is conferred  NUMB  TUESDAY  November    Eurip  THERE is no temper so universally indulged as hope other passions operate by starts on particular occasions or in certain parts of life but hope begins with the first power of comparing our actual with our possible state and attends us through every stage and period of our lives always urging us forward to new acquisitions and holding out some distant blessing to our view promising us either relief from pain or increase of happiness  HOPE is necessary in every condition The miseries of poverty of sickness of captivity  would without this comfort be insupportable nor does it appear that the happiest lot of terrestrial existence can set us above the want of this general blessing or that life when the gifts of nature and of fortune are accumulated upon it would not still be wretched were it not elevated and delighted by the expectation of some new possession of some enjoyment yet behind by which the wish shall be at last satisfied and the heart filled up to its utmost extent  HOPE is indeed very fallacious and promises what it seldom gives but its promises are more valuable than the gifts of fortune and it seldom frustrates us without assuring us of recompensing the delay by a greater bounty  I WAS musing on this strange inclination which every man feels to deceive himself and considering the advantages and dangers proceeding from this gay prospect of futurity when falling asleep on a sudden I found myself placed in a garden of which my sight could descry no limits Every scene about me was gay and gladsome light with sunshine and fragrant with perfumes the ground  was painted with all the variety of spring and all the choir of nature was singing in the groves When I had recovered from the first raptures with which the confusion of pleasure had for a time entranced me I began to take a particular and deliberate view of this delightful region I then perceived that I had yet higher gratifications to expect and that at a small distance from me there were brighter flowers clearer fountains and more losty groves where the birds which I yet heard but faintly were exerting all the power of melody The trees about me were beautiful with verdure and fragrant with blossoms but I was tempted to leave them by the sight of ripe fruits which seemed to hang only to be plucked I therefore walked hastily forwards but found as I proceeded that the colours of the field faded at my approach the fruit fell before I reached it the birds flew still singing before me and though I pressed onward with great celerity I was still in sight of pleasures of which I could not yet gain the possession and which seemed to mock my diligence and to retire as I advanced  THOUGH I was confounded with so many alternations of joy and grief I yet persisted to  go forward in hopes that these fugitive delights would in time be overtaken At length I saw an innumerable multitude of every age and sex who seemed all to partake of some general felicity for every cheek was flushed with confidence and every eye sparkled with eagerness yet each appeared to have some particular and secret pleasure and very few were willing to communicate their intentions or extend their concern beyond themselves Most of them seemed by the rapidity of their motion too busy to gratify the curiosity of a stranger and therefore I was content for a while to gaze upon them without interrupting them with troublesome enquiries At last I observed one man worn with time and unable to struggle in the croud and therefore supposing him more at leisure I began to accost him but he turned from me with anger and told me he must not be disturbed for the great hour of projection was now come when Mercury should lose his wings and slavery should no longer dig the mine for gold  I LEFT hin and attempted another whose softness of mien and easy movement gave me reason to hope for a more agreeable reception but he told me with a low bow  that nothing would make him more happy than an opportunity of serving me which he could not now want for a place which he had been twenty years soliciting would be soon vacant From him I had recourse to the next who was departing in haste to take possession of the estate of an uncle who by the course of nature could not live long He that followed was preparing to dive for treasure in a newinvented bell and another was on the point of discovering the longitude  BEING thus rejected wheresoever I applied myself for information I began to imagine it best to desist from enquiry and try what my own observation would discover but seeing a young man gay and thoughtless I resolved upon one more experiment and was informed that I was in the garden of HOPE the daughter of DESIRE and that all those whom I saw thus tumultuously bustling round me were incited by the promises of HOPE and hastening to seize the gifts which she held in her hand  I TURNED my sight upward and saw a goddess in the bloom of youth sitting on a throne around her lay all the gifts of fortune  and all the blessings of life were spread abroad to view she had a perpetual gayety of aspect and every one imagined that her smile which was impartial and general was directed to himself and triumphed in his own superiority to others who had conceived the same confidence from the same mistake  I THEN mounted an eminence from which I had a more extensive view of the whole place and could with less perplexity consider the different conduct of the crouds that filled it From this station I observed that the entrance into the garden of HOPE was by two gates one of which was kept by REASON and the other by FANCY REASON was surly and scrupulous and seldom turned the key without many interrogatories and long hesitation but FANCY was a kind and gentle portress she held her gate wide open and welcomed all equally to the district under her superintendency so that the passage was crouded by all those who either feared the examination of REASON or had been rejected by her  FROM the gate of REASON there was a way to the throne of HOPE by a craggy  slippery and winding path called the  Streight of Difficulty  which those who entered with the permission of the guard endeavoured to climb But tho' they surveyed the way very chearfully before they began to rise and marked out the several stages of their progress they commonly found unexpected obstacles and were obliged frequently to stop on the sudden where they imagined the way plain and even A thousand intricacies embarrassed them a thousand slips threw them back and a thousand pitfals impeded their advance So formidable were the dangers and so frequent the miscarriages that many returned from the first attempt and many fainted in the midst of the way and only a very small number were led up to the summit of HOPE by the hand of FORTITUDE Of these few the greater part when they had obtained the gift which HOPE had promised them regretted the labour which it cost and felt in their success the regret of disappointment the rest retired with their prize and were led by WISDOM to the bowers of CONTENT  TURNING then towards the gate of FANCY I could find no way to the seat of HOPE but though she sat full in view and held out  her gifts with an air of invitation which filled every heart with rapture the mountain was on that side inaccessibly steep but so channelled and shaded that none perceived the impossibility of ascending it but each imagined himself to have discovered a way to which the rest were strangers Many expedients were indeed tried by this industrious tribe of whom some were making themselves wings which others were contriving to actuate by the perpetual motion But with all their labour and all their artifices they never rose above the ground or quickly fell back nor ever approached the throne of HOPE but continued still to gaze at a distance and laughed at the slow progress of those whom they saw toiling in the  Streight of Difficulty  PART of the favourites of FANCY when they had entered the garden without making like the rest any attempt to climb the mountain turned immediately to the vale of IDLENESS a calm and undisturbed retirement from whence they could always have HOPE in prospect and to which they pleased themselves with believing that she intended speedily to descend These were indeed scorned by all the rest but they seemed very little affected  by contempt advice or reproof but were resolved to expect at ease the favour of the goddess  AMONG this gay race I was wandering and found them ready to answer all my questions and willing to communicate their mirth but turning round I saw two dreadful monsters entring the vale one of whom I knew to be AGE and the other WANT Sport and revelling were now at an end and an universal shrick of affright and distress burst out and awaked me  NUMB  SATURDAY  November    Vivendum rectè cum propter plurima tunc his  Praecipue causis ut linguas mancipiorum  Contemnas nam lingua mali pars pessima servi  JUV  THE younger Pliny has very justly observed that of actions which deserve our attention the most splendid are not always the greatest Fame and wonder and  applause are not excited but by external and adventitious circumstances often distinct and separate from virtue and heroism Eminence of station greatness of effect and all the favours of fortune must concur to place excellence in publick view but fortitude and diligence and patience divested of their show glide unobserved through the croud of life and suffer and act though with the same vigour and constancy yet without pity and without praise  THIS remark may be extended to all parts of life Nothing is to be estimated by its effect upon common eyes and common ears A thousand miseries make silent and invisible inroads on mankind and the heart feels innumerable throbs which never break into complaint Perhaps likewise our pleasures are for the most part equally secret and most are born up by some private satisfaction some internal consciousness some latent hope some peculiar prospect which they never communicate but reserve for solitary hours and clandestine meditation  THE main of life is indeed composed of small incidents and petty occurrences of  wishes for objects not remote and grief for disappointments of no fatal consequence of insect vexations which sting us and fly away impertinences which buzz a while about us and are heard no more of meteorous pleasures which dance before us and are dissipated of compliments which glide off the soul like other musick and are forgotten by him that gave and him that received them  SUCH is the general heap out of which every man is to cull his own condition for as the chymists tell us that all bodies are resolvable into the same elements and that the bound less variety of things arises from the different proportions of very few ingredients so a few pains and a few pleasures are all the materials of human life and of these the proportions are partly allotted by providence and partly left to the arrangement of reason and of choice  AS these are well or ill disposed man is for the most part happy or miserable For very few are involved in great events or have their thread of life entwisted with the chain of causes on which armies or nations are suspended and even those who seem wholly  busied in publick affairs and elevated above low cares or trivial pleasures pass the chief part of their time in familiar and domestick scenes from these they came into publick life to these they are every hour recalled by passions not to be suppressed in these they have the reward of their toils and to these at last they retire  THE great end of prudence is to give chearfulness to those hours which splendour cannot gild and acclamation cannot exhilarate those soft intervals of unbended amusement in which a man shrinks to his own natural dimensions and throws aside the ornaments or disguises which he feels in privacy to be useless incumbrances and to lose all effect when they become familiar To be happy at home is the ultimate result of all ambition the end to which every enterprise and labour tends and of which every desire prompts the prosecution  IT is indeed at home that every man must be known by those who would make a just estimate either of his virtue or felicity for smiles and embroidery are alike occasional  and the mind is often dressed for show in painted honour and fictitious benevolence  EVERY man must have found some whose lives in every house but their own was a continual series of hypocrisy and who concealed under fair appearances bad qualities which whenever they thought themselves out of the reach of censure broke out from their restraint like winds imprisoned in their caverns and whom every one had reason to love but they whose love a wise man is chiefly solicitous to procure And there are others who without any show of general goodness and without the attractions by which popularity is conciliated are received among their own families as bestowers of happiness and reverenced as instructors guardians and benefactors  THE most authentick witnesses of any man's character are those who know him in his own family and see him without any restraint or rule of conduct but such as he voluntarily prescribes to himself If a man carries virtue with him into his private apartments and takes no advantage of unlimited power or probable secresy if we trace him  through the round of his time and find that his character with those allowances which mortal frailty must always want is uniform and regular we have all the evidence of his sincerity that one man can have with regard to another and indeed as hypocrisy cannot be its own reward we may without hesitation determine that his heart is pure  THE highest panegyrick therefore that private virtue can receive is the praise of servants For however vanity or insolence may look down with contempt on the suffrage of men undignified by wealth and unenlightened by education it very seldom happens that they commend or blame without justice Vice and virtue are easily distinguished Oppression according to Harrington's aphorism will be felt by those that cannot see it and perhaps it falls out very often that in moral questions the philosophers in the gown and in the livery differ not so much in their sentiments as in their language and have equal power of discerning right though they cannot point it out to others with equal address  THERE are very few faults to be committed in solitude or without some agents partners  confederates or witnesses and therefore the servant must commonly know the secrets of a master who has any secrets to entrust and failings merely personal are so frequently exposed by that security which pride and folly generally produce and so inquisitively watched by that desire of reducing the inequalities of condition which the lower orders of the world will always feel that the testimony of a menial domestick can seldom be considered as defective for want of knowledge And though its impartiality may be sometimes suspected it is at least as credible as that of equals where rivalry instigates censure or friendship dictates palliations  THE danger of betraying our weakness to our servants and the impossibility of concealing it from them may be justly considered as one motive to a regular and irreproachable life For no condition is more hateful or despicable than his who has put himself in the power of his servant in the power of him whom perhaps he has first corrupted by making him subservient to his vices and whose fidelity he therefore cannot enforce by any precepts of honesty or reason It is seldom known that authority thus acquired is possessed without  insolence or that the master is not forced to confess by his tameness or forbearance that he has enslaved himself by some foolish confidence And his crime is equally punished whatever part he takes of the choice to which he is reduced and he is from that fatal hour in which he sacrificed his dignity to his passions in perpetual dread of insolence or defamation of a controuler at home or an accuser abroad He is condemned to purchase by continual bribes that secresy which bribes never secured and which after a long course of submission promises and anxieties he will find violated in a fit of rage or in a frolick of drunkenness  TO dread no eye and to suspect no tongue is the great prerogative of innocence an exemption granted only to invariable virtue But guilt has always its horrors and solicitudes and to make it yet more shameful and detestable is doomed often to stand in awe of those to whom nothing could give influence or weight but their power of betraying  NUMB  TUESDAY  November    Flet quoque ut in speculo rugas adspexit aniles  Tyndaris  et secum cur sit bis rapta requirit  Tempus edax rerum tuque invidiosa vetustas  Omnia destruitis vitiataque dentibus aevi  Paulatim lentâ consumitis omnia morte  OVID  AN old Greek epigrammatist intending to shew the miseries that attend the last stage of man imprecates upon those who are so foolish as to wish for long life the calamity of continuing to grow old from century to century He thought that no adventitious or foreign pain was requisite that decrepitude itself was an epitome of all that is dreadful and that nothing could be added to the curse of age but that it should be extended beyond its natural limits  THE most indifferent or negligent spectator can indeed scarcely retire without heaviness of heart from a view of the last scenes of the tragedy of life in which he finds those who in the former parts of the drama were  distinguished by opposition of conduct contrariety of designs and dissimilitude of personal qualities all involved in one common distress and all struggling with affliction which they cannot hope to overcome  ALL the other miseries which waylay our passage through the world wisdom may escape and fortitude may conquer by caution and circumspection we may steal along with very little to obstruct or incommode us by spirit and vigour we may force a way and reward the vexation of contest by the pleasures of victory But a time must come when all our policy and our bravery shall be equally useless when we shall all sink into helplesness and sadness without any power of receiving solace from the pleasures that have formerly delighted us or any prospect of emerging into a second possession of the blessings that we have lost  THE industry of man has indeed not been wanting in endeavours to procure comforts for these hours of dejection and melancholy and to gild the dreadful gloom with artificial light The most usual support of old age is wealth He whose possessions are  large and whose chests are full imagines himself always fortified against invasions on his authority and secure at least from open insult and apparent contempt If he has lost all other means of government if his strength and his reason fail him he can at least alter his will and therefore all that have hopes must likewise have fears and he may still continue to give laws to such as have not ceased to regard their own interest  THIS is indeed too frequently the citadel of the dotard the last fortress to which age retires and in which he makes the stand against the upstart race that is perpetually seizing his domains disputing his commands and cancelling his prescriptions But here though there may be safety there is no pleasure and what remains is but a proof that more was once possessed  NOTHING seems to have been more universally dreaded by the ancients than orbity or want of children and indeed to a man who has survived all the companions of his youth all who have participated his pleasures and his cares have been engaged in the same events and filled their minds with the same  conceptions this full peopled world is a dismal solitude He stands forlorn and silent neglected or insulted in the midst of multitudes animated with hopes which he cannot share and employed in business which he is no longer able to forward or retard nor can he find any to whom his life or his death are of importance unless he has secured some domestic gratifications some tender employments and endeared himself to some whose interest and gratitude may unite them to him  SO different are the colours of life as we look forward to the future or backward to the past and so different the opinions and sentiments which this contrariety of appearance naturally produces that the conversation of the old and young ends generally with contempt or pity on either side To a young man entering the world with fulness of hope and ardor of persuit nothing is so unpleasing as the cold caution the saint expectations the scrupulous diffidence which experience and disappointments certainly infuse and the old man wonders in his turn that the world never can grow wiser that neither precepts nor testimonies can cure boys of their credulity and sufficiency and that not one can be convinced  that snares are laid for him till he finds himself entangled  THUS one generation is always the scorn and wonder of the other and the notions of the old and young are like liquors of different gravity and texture which never can unite The spirits of youth sublimed by health and volatilised by passion soon leave behind them the phlegmatic sediment of wariness and deliberation and burst out in temerity and enterprise The tenderness therefore which nature infuses and which long habits of beneficence confirm is necessary to reconcile such opposition and an old man must be a father to bear with patience those follies and absurdities which he will perpetually imagine himself to find in the schemes and expectations the pleasures and the sorrows of those who have not yet been hardened by time and chilled by frustration  YET it may be doubted whether the pleasure of seeing children ripening into strength and importance be not overbalanced by the pain of seeing some fall in the blossom and others blasted in their growth some shaken down by storms some tainted with cankers  and some shrivelled in the shade and whether he that extends his care beyond himself does not multiply his anxieties more than his pleasure and weary himself to no purpose by superintending what he cannot regulate  BUT though age be to every order of human being sufficiently terrible it is particularly to be dreaded by fine ladies who have had no other end or ambition than to fill up the day and the night with dress diversions and flattery and who having made no acquaintance with knowledge or with business have constantly caught all their ideas from the current prattle of the hour and been indebted for all their happiness to compliments and treats With these ladies age begins early and very often lasts long it begins when their beauty fades when their mirth loses its sprightliness and their motion its case From that time all that gave them joy vanishes from about them they hear the praises bestowed on others which used to swell their bosoms with exultation They visit the seats of selicity and endeavour to continue the habit of being delighted But pleasure is only received when we believe that we give it in return and neglect and petulance soon inform them that their power  and their value are past and what then remains but a tedious and comfortless uniformity of time without any motion of the heart or exercise of the reason  YET however age may discourage us by its appearance from considering it in prospect we shall all by degrees certainly be old and therefore we ought to enquire what provision can be made against that time of distress what happiness can be stored up against the winter of life and how we may pass our latter years with serenity and chearfulness  IF it has been found by the experience of mankind that no season of life is able to supply itself with sufficient gratifications without anticipating uncertain felicities it cannot surely be supposed that old age worn with labours harrassed with anxieties and tortured with diseases should have any gladness of its own or feel any satisfaction from the contemplation of the present All the comfort that can now be expected must be recalled from the past or borrowed from the future the past is too often very soon exhausted all the events or actions of which the memory can afford pleasure are quickly recollected and  the future lies beyond the grave where it can be reached only by virtue and devotion  PIETY then is the only proper and adequate relief of decaying man since this world can give him no further prospects He therefore that grows old without religious hopes as he declines into imbecillity and feels pains and sorrows incessantly crowding upon him falls into a gulph of bottomless misery in which every reflection must plunge him deeper and where he finds only new gradations of anguish and precipices of horrour  NUMB  SATURDAY  Novemb    Argentea proles  Auro doterior fulvo pretiosior aere  OVID  HESIOD in his celebrated distribution of mankind divides them into three orders of intellect "The first place says he belongs to him that can by his own powers discern what is right and fit and penetrate to the remoter motives of action The second is claimed by him that is willing  to hear instruction and can perceive right and wrong when they are shewn him by another but he that has neither acuteness nor docility who can neither find the way by himself nor will be led by others is a wretch without use or value"  IF we survey the moral world it will be found that the same division may be made of men with regard to their virtue There are some whose principles are so firmly fixed whose conviction is so constantly present to their minds and who have raised in themselves such ardent wishes for the approbation of God and the happiness with which he has promised to reward obedience and perseverance that they rise above all other cares and considerations and uniformly examine every action and every desire by comparing it with the divine commands There are others in a kind of equipoise between good and ill who are moved on one part by riches or pleasure by the gratifications of passion and the delights of sense and on the other by laws of which they own the obligation and rewards of which they believe the reality and whom a very small addition of weight turns either way The third class consists of beings immersed  in pleasure or abandoned to passion without any desire of higher good or any effort to extend their thoughts beyond immediate and gross satisfactions  THE second class is so much more numerous than the first and last that it may be considered as comprising the whole body of mankind Those of the last are not very many and of the first are very few and neither the one nor the other fall much under the consideration of the moralist whose precepts are intended chiefly for those who are endeavouring to go forward up the steeps of virtue not for those who have already reached the summit or those who are resolved to stay for ever in their present situation  TO a man not versed in the living world but accustomed to judge of every thing only by speculative reason it is scarcely credible that any one should be in this state of indifference or stand undetermined and unengaged ready to follow the first call to either side It seems certain that a man either must believe that virtue will make him happy and resolve therefore to be virtuous or think that he may be happy without virtue and therefore  cast off all care but for his present interest It seems impossible that conviction should be on one side and practice on the other and that he who has seen the right way should voluntarily shut his eyes that he may quit it with more tranquillity Yet all these absurdities are every hour to be found the wisest and best men deviate from known and acknowledged duties by inadvertency or surprise and most are good no longer than while temptation is away than while their passions are without excitements and their opinions are free from the counteraction of any other motive  AMONG the sentiments which almost every man changes as he advances into years is the expectation of uniformity of character He that without acquaintance with the power of desire the cogency of distress the complications of affairs or the force of particular influence has filled his mind with the excellence of virtue he who having never tried his resolution in any encounters with hope or fear believes it able to stand firm whatever shall oppose it will be always clamorous against the smallest failure ready to exact the utmost punctualities of right and to consider  every man that fails in any part of his duty as without conscience and without merit unworthy of trust or love or pity or regard as an enemy whom all should join to drive out of society as a pest which all should avoid or as a weed which all should trample  IT is not but by experience that we are taught the possibility of retaining some virtues and rejecting others or of being good or bad to a particular degree For it is very easy to the solitary reasoner to prove that the same arguments by which the mind is fortified against one crime are of equal force against all and the consequence very naturally follows that he whom they fail to move on any occasion has either never considered them or has by some fallacy taught himself to evade their validity and that therefore when a man is known to be guilty of one crime no farther evidence is needful of his depravity and corruption  YET such is the state of all mortal virtue that it is always uncertain and variable sometimes extending to the whole compass of duty and sometimes shrinking into a narrow space and fortifying only a few avenues of  the heart while all the rest is left open to the incursions of appetite or given up to the dominion of wickedness Nothing therefore is more unjust than to judge of man by too short an acquintance and too slight inspection for it often happens that in the loose and thoughtless and dissipated there is a secret radical worth which may shoot out by proper cultivation that the spark of heaven though dimmed and obstructed is yet not extinguished but may by the breath of counsel and exhortation be kindled into flame  TO imagine that every one who is not completely good is irrecoverably abandoned is to suppose that all are capable of the same degrees of excellence it is indeed to exact from all that prefection which none ever can attain And since the purest virtue is consistent with some vice and the virtue of the greatest number with almost an equal proportion of contrary qualities let none too hastily conclude that all goodness is lost though it may for a time be clouded and overwhelmed for most minds are the slaves of external circumstances and conform to any hand that undertakes to mould them roll down any torrent of custom in which they happen to  be caught or bend to any importunity that bears hard against them  IT may be particularly observed of women that they are for the most part good or bad as they fall among those who practice vice or virtue and that neither education nor reason gives them much security against the influence of example Whether it be that thay have less courage to stand against opposition or that their desire of admiration makes them sacrifice their principles to the poor pleasure of worthless praise it is certain whatever be the cause that female goodness seldom keeps its ground against laughter flattery or fashion  FOR this reason every one should consider himself as entrusted not only with his own conduct but with that of others and as accountable not only for the duties which he neglects or the crimes that he commits but for that negligence and irregularity which he may encourage or inculcate Every man in whatever station has or endeavours to have his followers admirers and imitators has therefore the influence of his example to watch with care he ought to avoid not only crimes but the appearance of crimes and not  only to practise virtue but to applaud countenance and support it For it is possible that for want of attention we may teach others faults from which ourselves are free or by a heedless negligence or cowardly desertion of a good cause which we ourselves approve may alienate those who fix their eyes upon us and who having no certain rule of their own to guide their course in the ocean of the world are easily confounded by the aberrations of that example which they chuse for their direction  FINIS
