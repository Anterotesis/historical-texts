 REMARKS ON A PLAY CALL'D  The Conscious Lovers  A COMEDY  For changing Rules of late as if Men writ  In spite of  Reason    Nature    Art  and  Wit    Our Poets make us Laugh at Tragedy  And with their Comedies they make us cry  Prologue to the Rehearsal  It appears from Consideration of ancient as well as modern Time that the Cause and Interest of Criticks is the same with that of Wit Learning and good Sense  The late Earl of  Shaftsbury  's Characteristicks Vol p  By Mr DENNIS  LONDON  Printed for T WARNER at the  BlackBoy  in  PaterNosterRow  MDCCXXIII Price One Shilling  To the Right Honourable ROBERT WALPOLE  Esq  First Lord Commissioner of the  TREASURY  Chancellor of the  Exchequer  And One of His Majesty's  Most Honourable Privy Council  SIR  _I Take the Liberty of addressing the following Sheets to you without the Formality of asking your Leave I have for a long Time thought that such a Formality proposes an implicite Bargain which is very liable to be turn'd into Ridicule This was the Opinion  of the late Earl of  Hallifax  who had receiv'd more Addresses of this Nature than any Man of his Time The End of this Epistle is to return you my humble Thanks for Obligations past for Obligations laid not only upon me but upon my Country when you endeavour'd to serve it so warmly by opposing that desperate Scheme which had like to have proved so fatal to it and by advising after the Mischief was done the Use of Lenitives rather than of Corrosives which might have thrown all Things into Confusion Another Intention of this Address is to implore your Protection for the expiring Arts for those noble Arts in which you have been educated and which have rais'd you to this envied Heighth as it were on purpose that you may prove their Protector and Preserver You are not to be told Sir and it would be easy to prove it to the rest of the World that the Studies of Humanity in  Great Britain  have flourish'd with the Stage and that with  the Stage they must in time decline I speak not only of every other Branch of Poetry but even of that manly Eloquence which appears so conspicuous in you whenever you are pleas'd to display its Charms to an August Assembly But the Stage is just upon the Point of sinking unless an Arm so powerful as yours shall vouchsafe to support it A  Wat Tyler  a  Jack Straw  and a  Jack Cade  of  Parnassus  have by Encroachments got the entire Direction of it from its easy Patentee and seem resolv'd like their Namesakes of old to advance the Rabble and Scum of  Parnassus  and to oppress or demolish all whom God and Nature have plac'd above them The Dramatick Piece on which I have writ the following Remarks has with a thousand Faults and a thousand Weaknesses been palm'd upon the World by shameful Artifices for a Wonder of Art and Nature And that no one may presume to detect the Fraud the Author has insolently dar'd to fly for Protection  to the King himself But the Author ought to have known that it can never be the Design of so good and so wise a King to shelter Error from the Attacks of Reason He ought to have known that the King has declar'd his Intention to encourage real Merit that Learning and Arts may flourish by which Glory may accrue to His Reign and Honour to  Great Britain  You know very well Sir that there has not been in  Europe  these thousand Years a Prince more haughty than  Lewis  XIV a Prince more jealous of his Authority and more ambitious of Glory You know Sir that almost all his Poetical Subjects who knew the darling Passion of his Soul address'd some of their Works to him You know very well Sir that most of them had been rewarded by him And yet when  BOILEAU  in a Discourse address'd to that King himself and afterwards prefixed to his Works expos'd and ridiculed the greatest Part of those Pieces you know very well Sir that that discerning  Prince who saw that his true Interest and his solid Glory depended upon the Advancement of Arts and upon the encouraging real Merit was so far from being offended with  BOILEAU  for the Liberty he took in that Discourse that it recommended him to his Favour  I do believe from my very Soul that 'tis the Intention of so wise a Prince as the King to encourage Arts and Learning and I should have believ'd it tho' the King had never told us so because I know it to be his true Interest And therefore I can never believe that 'tis the King's Intention any more to patronize Ignorance and Error in the Writings of his Subjects than to protect their Vices and Follies of any other Kind For Ignorance and Error and Vice and Folly must estrange the Hearts of his Subjects from him only Ignorance and Error and Vice and Folly can favour and indulge that Superstition and that false Religion which are his mortal Enemies  And yet it has happen'd by I know not what sort of Caprice of Fortune or of Fate that Arts and Learning have of late sensibly if not precipitately declin'd Never did such a Crowd of ill Plays and miserable Poems appear in so short a Time We have hardly seen one good one And what is yet more surprising the most stupid of all those Plays and Poems have been address'd to the King himself One would swear that the Authors were wild enough to expect that Pensions Gratuities and Salaries should be appointed to encourage Stupidity and to mortify Sense and Merit The very Boast and Glory of the  British  Muse is Comedy in which  Great Britain  excels every other Country Nay we can shew more good and more entertaining Comedies than all the rest of  Europe  together During the whole Reigns of King  Charles  King  James  and King  William  there hardly pass'd a Year without one or two and sometimes three During the Reign of King  William  alone we  had seven or eight very agreeable ones only from two Gentlemen Sir  John Vanbrugh  and Mr  Congreve  But since that pernicious Licence was granted to four sordid Players during the late Queen's Time we have hardly had one that has been worth one Farthing  Sir As the King upon his Accession to the Crown came a Stranger among us and as the Ministry had then and have had almost ever since Affairs of greater and more immediate Importance than those of the Theatre the aforesaid Grant of the late Queen was unhappily renew'd since which the Stage has yearly declin'd and does decline daily and every Branch of Human Learning daily declines with it  Etenim omnes artes quae ad Humanitatem pertinent habeant quoddam commune vinculum quasi cognatione quadam inter se continentur  Thus all the Branches of Human Learning are like to be lost or very much impair'd unless you generously undertake to support them If the Condition in which they are  were but known to the King I am confident he would not suffer them to be driven from among us during his Reign as he regards either his own Interest and Glory or the Interest and Glory of the Nation which he governs Nor is it beneath the greatest and the wisest Minister to take care of Arts and Letters Two of the greatest that ever were in the World  Maecenas  and Cardinal  Richlieu  are chiefly famous for the Protection they gave to them Whenever in any Nation Human Learning has been diligently and impartially cultivated at that Time that Nation has flourish'd its King has been glorious and belov'd and his Ministers renowned and happy I am  SIR  Your most Humble Most Obliged and Most Obedient Servant JOHN DENNIS  THE PREFACE  _WHEN sometime before the acting of Sir  Richard  's Play I observed the scandalous Artifices that were practis'd to procure Success to it and was acquainted with the double Cheat which was to be impos'd on the Town upon their Pockets and upon their Understandings I thought I should deserve the Favour of the Publick if I discover'd and prevented so gross an Imposition and so palpable an Affront But instead of meeting with the  Thanks which I expected and which I thought I had merited by the Service I intended them I found myself in the same Situation that  Surly  was upon discovering the Cheat in the  Alchymist  for not only  Face  and  Subtle  who were Joyntpartners in carrying on this Poetical Cheat made vehement Outcries and spread various Slanders and engag'd several of their Bubbles to believe them and disperse them but they obliged the most Senseless of all their Bubbles to repeat the Scurrility which they dictated to them This immediately not only recall'd  Butler  's Verses to my Remembrance  Doubtless the Pleasure is as great  Of being cheated as to cheat  As Lookerson feel most Delight  That least perceive a Juggler's Slight  And still the less they understand  The more th' admire his Slight of Hand  but made me suspect that  Butler  in this hardly came up to the full Truth because the foolish Part of the World loves more to be cheated than the knavish Part does to cheat  The Generality of Mankind are sure to love him who imposes on them and to hate him who opens their Eyes For he who cheats them does it by entertaining some pleasing Passion But he who undeceives them holds the Glass to them and shews them Truth and themselves a mortifying Sight Now whenever you put a Man out of Conceit with himself you put him out of Humour with you likewise All the Time the grand Cheat of the South Sea was carrying on by the first Directors I constantly observ'd that if any one at any Time was so hardy as to tell any one of the Subcribers that he was cheated it made him terribly out of humour with him who told him so and augmented his implicit Faith in the Directors who cheated him and redoubled his Respect and Esteem for them  The double Cheat abovemention'd which was contriv'd by  Face  and  Subtle  in Concert but executed cheifly by  Subtle  was perhaps the most audacious that ever was impos'd on the Capital of a great People by Persons who pretended at the same Time to act by publick Authority And I know not which is the  more impudent Part of it the using such scandalous Methods to make the most absurd and most insipid Entertainment that ever came upon the  English  Stage pass for the very best or the raising the Prices for a Humdrum Representation which they had nicknamed a Comedy and the raising them on the Account of the Scenes forsooth Sir  William Davenant  was the first who brought Scenes upon the Stage towards the Middle of the last Century and to defray the Expence of them from time to time rais'd the Theatrical Receipt above a third Part higher than it was before The Pit which was before but eighteen Pence was rais'd to Half a Crown The Boxes which were Half a Crown before were advanc'd to four Shillings the first Gallery from a Shilling to eighteen Pence and the upper Gallery from Sixpence to a Shilling So that as I said before there is above a third Part of each Night's Receipt even at the common Prices allow'd for the Scenes Now what shall we say of these most sordid Wretches whose Avarice is no more to be satisfied than the barren Womb or the Grave They are not contented  it seems with getting even at common Prices each of them a thousand or fifteen Hundred Pounds a Year which enables them to live in shameful Luxury disgraceful to  Great Britain  They are not contented to loll each of them in his gilded Chariot as often as they vouchsafe at their own Expence to give the Publick a  Farce  without Doors and to look down upon the transitory Bubles who support them They are not contented to enjoy their unmerited Gains without paying any Thing out of them either to Poor or Publi  and that at a Time when Offices Salaries Pensions when every Mortal every Thing is tax'd They are not content to be thus unaccountably indulg'd but at the same Time they must impose upon the Publick and wrong their Audiences of twelve hundred Pounds as they certainly did during what in their Theatrical Cant they call the Run of their last  Rhapsody  Some People take Success to be a Proof of Merit in Writers whereas in the Degeneracy of Taste if 'tis attended with a Cabal 'tis a certain Proof of the want of it All the  Roman  Satirists were out of Humour with  the successful Scriblers of their Times because as it appears by what they say of them they ow'd their Success to Cabals and to the repeating their Works to Assemblies Witness what  Horace  says of  Fannius  in the    th Satire of the first Book  Beatus Fannius ultro  Delatis capsis imagine cum mea nemo  Scripta legat vulgo recitare timentis  And what  Juvenal  says in the beginning of his first Satire  Semper ego Auditor tantum nunquamne reponam  Vexatus toties Rauci Theseide Codri  Ergo impune mihi recitaverit ille togatas  Hic elegos  But besides undeserved Success the  Roman  Satirists had another Provocation to Satire and that was Hypocrisy when Persons who were void of all Morality pretended to a more rigid Virtue than all the rest of  the World and it was this chiefly that mov'd the Spleen of  Lucilius  as  Horace  tells us in the first Satire of his second Book  est Lucilius ausus  Primus in hunc operis componere carmina morem  Detrahere pellem nitidus quâ quisque per ora  Cederet introrsum turpis  But if such vile Wretches ever arrived to such a Height of Impudence as to pretend to teach Virtue to the rest of the World the Provocation then became insupportable and the Satirist began with Fury  Ultra Sauromatas fugere hinc libet glacialem  Oceanum quoties aliquid de moribus audent  Qui Curios simulant Bacchanalia vivunt  Juv Sat  As I make no doubt but that upon the publishing this little Treatise there will be the same Outcries against Criticks and Criticism which have been formerly so often raised I shall lay before the Reader what the late Earl of  Shaftsbury  writ in Defence of them with a great deal of good Sense and Address and Penetration The Passage is in the    th Page of the first Volume of the  Characteristicks  Nor should I suspect the Genius of our Writers or charge them with Meanness and Insufficiency on the account of this Lowspiritedness which they discover were it not for another sort of Fear by which they more plainly betray themselves and seem conscious of their own Defects The Criticks it seems are formidable to 'em TheCriticks are the dreadful Spectres the Giants the Enchanters who traverse and disturb them in their Works These are the Persecutors for whose Sakes they are ready to hide their Heads begging Rescue and Protection from all good People and flying in particular to the Great by whose Favour they hope to be defended  from this merciless examining Race for what can be more cruel than to be forc'd to submit to the rigorous Laws of Wit and write under such severe Judges as are deaf to all Courtship and can be wrought upon by no Insinuation or Flattery to pass by Faults and pardon any Transgression of Art  To judge indeed of the Circumstances of a modern Author by the Pattern of his Prefaces Dedications and Introductions one would think that at the Moment when a Piece of his was in hand some Conjuration was forming against him some diabolical Powers drawing together to blast his Work and cross his generous Design he therefore rouzes his Indignation hardens his Forehead and with many furious Defiances and  AvauntSatans  enters on his Business not with the least regard to what may justly be objected to him in a way of Criticism but with an absolute Contempt of the Manner and Art itself  Odi profanum vulgus arceo  was in its time no doubt a generous Defiance  the  Avaunt  was natural and proper in its place especially where Religion and Virtue were the Poets Theme but with our Moderns the Case is generally the very reverse and accordingly the Defiance or  Avaunt  should run much after this manner As for you vulgar Souls mere Naturals who know no Art were never admitted into the Temple of Wisdom nor ever visited the Sanctuaries of Wit or Learning gather yourselves together from all Parts and hearken to the Song or Tale I am about to utter but for you Men of Science and Understanding who have Ears and Judgment and can weigh Sense scan Syllables and measure Sounds you who by a certain Art distinguish false Thought from true Correctness from Rudeness and Bombast and Chaos from Order and the Sublime away hence or stand aloof whilst I practise upon the Easiness of those mean Capacities and Apprehensions who make the most numerous Audience and are the only competent Judges of my Labours  Accuracy of Workmanship requires a Critick's Eye 'tis lost upon a vulgar Judgment Nothing grieves a real Artist more than that Indifference of the Publick which suffers Work to pass uncriticiz'd Nothing on the other Side rejoices him more than the nice View and Inspection of the accurate Examiner and Judge of Work 'Tis the mean Genius the slovenly Performer who knowing nothing of true Workmanship endeavours by the best outward Gloss and dazzling Shew to turn the Eye from a direct and steddy Survey of his Piece  What is there which an expert Musician more desires than to perform his Part in in the Presence of those who are knowing in his Art 'Tis to the Ear alone he applies himself the critical the nice Ear Let his Hearers be of what Character they please Be they naturally austere morose or rigid no matter so they are Criticks able to censure remark and sound every Accord and Symphony What is there mortifies the good Painter more than when amidst his admiring Spectators there is not one present who has been us'd to compare the  Hands of different Masters or has an Eye to distinguish the Advantages or Defects of every Stile Thro' all the inferior Orders of Mechanicks the Rule is found to hold the same In every Science every Art the real Masters or Proficients rejoice in nothing more than in the thorough Search and Examination of their Performances by all the Rules of Art and nicest Criticism Why therefore in the Muses Name is it not the same with our Pretenders to the Writing Art our Poets and Prose Authors of every kind Why in this Profession are we found such CritickHaters and indulg'd in this unlearn'd Aversion unless it be taken for granted that as Wit and Learning stand at present in our Nation we are still upon the Foot of Empiricks and Mountebanks  From these Considerations I take upon me absolutely to condemn the fashionable Custom of inveighing against  Criticks  as the common Enemies the Pests and Incendiaries of the Commonwealth of Wit and Letters I assert on the contrary that they are the Props and Pillars of this Building  and that without the Encouragement and Propagation of this Race we should remain as  Gothick Architects  as ever  Thus far the late most ingenious and most judicious Earl of  Shaftsbury  has gone in the Defence of Criticks and Criticism I shall desire to say a little in my own particular Defence I have been long since represented by Persons who have never read what I have writ as one who likes nothing and one who makes it his Business to find out Faults and never discovers Beauties Upon my publishing lately the Defence of Sir  Fopling Flutter  this Accusation was renew'd tho' it was a Contradiction in Terms It being impossible that any one can write a Defence of a  Dramatick  Poem which he does not like or commend a Comedy in which he finds no Beauties The Truth of this Affair is that no  English  Author of any Note has commended so many  English  Poets as I have I shall give a List of some of them  Shakespear    Ben Johnson    Milton    Butler    Roscomon    Denham    Waller    Dryden    Wycherly    Otway    Etherege    Shadwell    Crown    Congreve    Phillips  These are some of those whom I have occasionally  commended and in some of them too have found out Beauties which every one could not discover  If any one believes that in some Places of the following Sheets I have been too harsh and too severe I desire such a one to consider that I have been basely wrong'd and barbarously us'd by the Persons upon whom I may be thought to be too severe And as the Wrongs which have been done me do not come within the Cognizance of the National Law nor under the usual Forms of the National Equity I am as to this Matter in a State of Nature with those Persons and am authoriz'd by the Law of Nature to do myself Justice as far as it may be done without offending the Laws of my Country or impartial Equity  REMARKS ON THE PREFACE TO THE  Conscious Lovers  _THE Author tells us in the Beginning of his Preface That  this Comedy has been receiv'd with universal Acceptance  Whether he is in the Right or not I appeal to the World The Reason which he gives for this universal Acceptance is very extraordinary  It has been receiv'd  says he  with universal Acceptance for it was in every Part excellently perform'd  Is it not a pleasant  Humility in a Dramatick Writer to affirm that he is indebted for his whole Success to the Actors I was apt to believe at the first Sight that this was an affected Modesty and a counterfeit Humility But when I went a little further I began to think I was mistaken and that the Author was in earnest for he seems to be apprehensive that the Applause of the Reader would hardly be so general as was that of the Spectator and he does his Endeavour to induce the Reader not to pass a Judgment of the Play till he has seen it acted  It must be remembred  says he  that a Play is to be seen and is made to be represented with the Advantage of Actors nor can appear but with half the Spirit without it  Now there have been several Plays writ in several Languages which were never design'd to be seen There are two of our own The Tragedy of  Sampson  by  Milton  and the  State of Innocence  by  Dryden  'Tis true indeed most Plays are design'd by their Authors to be seen but that is not the chief Design of a Dramatick Writer who has a good Genius For such an Author writes to all Countries and to all Ages and writes with the lively Hope that his great Masterpieces shall outlive the very Language in which they are compos'd When Sir  Richard  says That a Play can appear but with half the Spirit unless we see it acted I would fain ask on whom he designs to impose this If he who  reads a Play is qualified to read and to judge he reads it with a truer and juster Spirit than can be supplied by any Company of Actors If such a Reader happens at any Time to be better pleased with the Representation of a Play than the reading it 'tis an infallible Sign that such a Play is a very wretched Performance  But let us see how Sir  Richard  goes on  The greatest Effect  says he  of a Play in reading it is to excite the Reader to go see it and when he does so it is then a Play has the Effect of Precept and Example  Good God is it possible that this could come from any one but a Man who is resolv'd to shew that he takes all his Readers to be Ideots When we read the Tragedies of  Sophocles  or  Euripides  or the Comedies of  Aristophanes    Plautus  or  Terence  is the greatest Effect they have upon us the exciting us to go to see them acted When Sir  Richard  read the  Andria  of  Terence  was the exciting him to go to see it acted the greatest Effect that it had upon him No the greatest Effect that it had upon him was the Desire to see another Play acted and that was his own deplorable Imitation of the  Andria  But a Play  says he  has only in the Representation the Effect of Example and Precept  So that 'tis not the Dramatick Persons it seems 'tis not  Timoleon    Scipio    Bontus  who are to be the Examples of Virtue  to us no 'tis the Players I warrant who represent them 'tis Mr  Booth  Mr  Robert Wilks  and Mr  Colley Cibber  whose Heroick Virtue we are to imitate and by whose Actions we are to be instructed  But Sir  Richard  goes on and tells us That the chief Design of the  Conscious Lovers  was to be an innocent Performance Now there are a hundred innocent Performances upon the  British  Stage But perhaps he meant a Performance that should have nothing but its Innocence to recommend it and should by consequence be thought the only Play of its Kind But in that he is mistaken for there is one more and that is the Performance of  Bays  in the  Rehearsal  which is indeed incoherent incongruous impertinent insipid and ridiculous but certainly a very innocent Performance I am afraid it will appear by the following Sheets that the  Conscious Lovers  has no small Share of some of these Qualities and has nothing valuable but barely the Catastrophe And here I cannot but observe that Sir  Richard  who has upon so many Occasions inveigh'd against the Rules and particularly in that notable Paper call'd the  Theatre  owes the only entertaining Scene of his Play to the Observation of a Rule of  Aristotle  which is That the Discovery should be immediately follow'd by the Change of Fortune that is by the Catastrophe Sir  Richard  indeed without ever  dreaming of  Aristotle  had it from  Terence  who took it from  Menander  who had it from the Precept of that great Philosopher and from the Practice of  Sophocles  and  Euripides  For the tragick and comick Poets frequently borrow'd their Hints from one another but at the same time took Care to do it with Judgment and not to intrench upon each other's Province And therefore we see that the Discovery in  Terence  and the Reconciliation of  Simo  to  Pamphilus  is comprehended in a narrow Compass and has nothing in it of those violent Transports of Grief which are inconsistent with Comedy  Versibus exponi Tragicis res comica non vult  says  Horace  in his  Art of Poetry  which  Boileau  has imitated in the two following Lines of his  Le Comique ennemi des soupirs des pleurs  N'admet point en soi des Tragiques Douleurs  But I beg the Reader's Pardon for this Digression and now return to the Preface  As to the Quarrel in the fourth Act I shall speak to it in its Place In the mean time I am of the Number of those who believe that this Incident and the Case of the Father and Daughter are not the proper Subjects  of Comedy When Sir  Richard  says that any thing that has its Foundation in Happiness and Success must be the Subject of Comedy he confounds Comedy with that Species of Tragedy which has a happy Catastrophe When he says that 'tis an Improvement of Comedy to introduce a Joy too exquisite for Laughter he takes all the Care that he can to shew that he knows nothing of the Nature of Comedy Does he really believe that  Moliere  understood the Nature of it I say  Moliere  who in the Opinion of all  Europe  excepting that small Portion of it which is acquainted with  Ben Johnson  had born away the Prize of Comedy from all Nations and from all Ages if for the sake of his Profit he had not descended sometimes too much to Buffoonry Let Sir  Richard  or any one look into that little Piece of  Moliere  call'd  La Critique de l'Ecole des Femmes  and he shall find there that in  Moliere  's Opinion 'tis the Business of a Comick Poet to enter into the Ridicule of Men and to expose the blind Sides of all Sorts of People agreeably that he does nothing at all if he does not draw the Pictures of his Contemporaries and does not raise the Mirth of the sensible Part of an Audience which says he 'tis no easy Matter to do This is the Sense of  Moliere  tho' the Words are not his exactly  When Sir  Richard  talks of a Joy too exquisite for Laughter he seems not to know that Joy generally taken is common like Anger Indignation Love to all Sorts of Poetry to the Epick the Dramatick the Lyrick but that that kind of Joy which is attended with Laughter is the Characteristick of Comedy as Terror or Compassion according as one or the other is predominant makes the Characteristick of Tragedy as Admiration does of Epick Poetry  When Sir  Richard  says That weeping upon the Sight of a deplorable Object is not a Subject for Laughter but that 'tis agreeable to good Sense and to Humanity he says nothing but what all the sensible Part of the World has already granted but then all that sensible Part of the World have always deny'd that a deplorable Object is fit to be shewn in Comedy When Sir  George Etherege  in his Comedy of  Sir Fopling Flutter  shews  Loveit  in all the Height and Violence of Grief and Rage the Judicious Poet takes care to give those Passions a ridiculous Turn by the Mouth of  Dorimant  Besides that the Subject is at the Bottom ridiculous For  Loveit  is a Mistress who has abandon'd her self to  Dorimant  and by falling into these violent Passions only because she fancies that something of which she is very desirous has gone beside her makes herself truly ridiculous Thus is this famous Scene in the second  Act of  Sir Foppling  by the Character of  Loveit  and the dextrous handling the Subject kept within the Bounds of Comedy But the Scene of the Discovery in the  Conscious Lovers  is truly Tragical  Indiana  was strictly virtuous She had indeed conceiv'd a violent Passion for  Bevil  but all young People in full Health are liable to such a Passion and perhaps the most sensible and the most virtuous are more than others liable But besides that she had kept this Passion within the Bounds of Honour it was the natural Effect of her Esteem for her Benefactor and of her Gratitude that is of her Virtue These Considerations render'd her Case deplorable and the Catastrophe downright tragical which of a Comedy ought to be the most comical Part for the same Reason that it ought to be the most tragical Part of a Tragedy  Before I take my Leave of Sir  Richard  's Preface I cannot help saying a Word to his Song which he has brought in here by Violence to the great Surprize of the Reader for no other End than to shew that he is as notable at Metre as he is at Prose He seems as much concern'd for the Omission of it in the Representation of his as  Bays  in the third Act of the  Rehearsal  is for the Neglect of his nay and to have as high an Opinion of it as that merry Bard discovers that he has of his when he says to  Johnson What are they gone without singing my last new Song 's Bud would it were in their Bellies I'll tell you Mr  Johnson  if I have any Skill in these Matters I vow to Gad this Song is peremptorily the very best that ever yet was written You must know it was made by  Tom Thimble  's first Wife after she was dead  So that this Song of Mr  Bays  too as well as his Brother Sir  Richard  's is a LoveSong design'd just as judiciously express'd just as passionately but more harmoniously more freely and better contriv'd for Melody And yet from the Omission of this Song of his does Sir  Richard  take an occasion to affront the finest Artist of his kind in the World and to treat Signor  Carbonelli  like a Country Fidler who sings  John Dory  at Wakes and Fairs to Hobnail'd Peasants and MilkMaids  I thought here to take my Leave but the Sight of  Terence  and  Cibber  together provokes me to go a little farther  Jungentur jam gryphes equis aevoque sequenti  Cum canibus timidi venient ad pocula damae  Virg  Sir  Richard  says that he is extremely surpriz'd to find what  Cibber  told him prove a Truth that what he valued himself so much upon the Translation of  Terence  should be  imputed to him as a Reproach Sir  Richard  knew very well that  Cibber  had said so many false Things with relation to this Play that he might be very well surpriz'd to find Truth come from him especially upon that Subject But Sir  Richard  is mistaken  Cibber  is constant to himself and does not deviate from Falshood upon this Occasion No Mortal reproaches Sir  Richard  with his Translation of  Terence  He has shewn clearly that he is not capable of translating any one Scene of him But tho' he had been never so capable he ought to have known that a Translation of  Terence  by the best Hand in the World would not succeed upon the  English  Stage He ought to have known the Defect that the  Romans  themselves who liv'd some time after him and especially  Caesar  found in that Comick Poet The great Objection to him was that he wanted the comick Force that is to say that he had not in his Comedies that Humour and Pleasantry which are so agreeable to the Nature of Comedy For the Force of any kind of Writing consists chiefly in that which distinguishes it from all other Kinds Now the Ridicule being that which distinguishes Comedy from every other kind of Poetry the  Comick Force  must consist in that But how came it to pass then that five of the six Comedies of  Terence  succeeded upon the  Roman  Stage The Answer is plain because  the Generality of the  Romans  at the Time they were writ knew no better The  Roman  Comedy in general had but little of that agreeable Pleasantry that is fit to divert Men of Sense which occasion'd the following Censure of  Quintilian    In Comaedia maxime claudicamus licet  Varro  dicat Musas  Aelii Stolonis  sententia  Plautino  sermone locuturas fuisse si latinè loqui vellent licet Caecilium veteres laudibus ferant licet  Terentii  scripta ad  Scipionem Africanum  referantur quae tamen sunt in hoc genere elegantissima plus adhuc habitura gratiae si intra Versus trimetros stetissent Vix levem consequimur umbram adeo ut mihi sermo ipse  Romanus  non recipere videatur illam solis concessam Atticis venerem quando eam ne  Graeci  quidem in alio genere linguae obtinuerint  And therefore when  Shadwell  undertook to write a Comedy upon the Plan of the  Adelphi  he who very well knew the Nature of his Art and by consequence knew what was defective in the  Roman  Comedy took particular Care to supply from his own Invention the Ridicule that was wanting in that and it was by using that Method that he made the  Squire of Alsatia  a very good and very entertaining Comedy  Moliere  who writ upon the same Plan has done the very same Thing in his  L'Ecole des Maris  He has done the very same in his  Fourberies de Scapin  which is writ upon  the Plan of the  Phormio  but in the latter he has gone too far and shamefully to use the Expression of  Boileau  coupled  Terence  with  JackPudding  a Conjunction as scandalous as Sir  Richard  had made of  Terence  and his Friend  Cibber  I heartily congratulate both of them upon this their mutual Friendship They are  par nobile fratrum  a Pair so pious so good so human so virtuous so religious that they are perfectly secur'd even in the midst of a treacherous World of each other's mutual Fidelity because there is not in the World that Third Person who is fit to be a Friend to either The Knight was too humble when he attributed the great Success of his Play to the Players in general the Success is only due to himself and to his virtuous Friend that is to that Cabal which was so industriously conven'd by them and to those Artifices which were with so much Skill conducted by them They have done greater Services than this for each other and have secured the Stage to themselves alone which they regard as their proper  Domain  and therefore every Stranger who for the future comes upon their Ground is to be esteem'd a Trespasser In the mean Time they have resolved between themselves to make the Town swallow any Entertainment which they shall think fit to provide for them and they seem agreed to vouch for each other  Cibber  is to make Affidavit that the Knight's  Gudgeons are CodFish and SeaCarp that arriv'd by the last FishPool and the Knight is to give it upon his immaculate Honour that  Cibber  's StrickleBats and MillersThumbs are either Mullets or Turbuts And they seem to have made a formal Order That the Town shall believe them under the Penalty of being treated with the same Anathema's that  Martin  and  John  were treated by  Peter  in the  Tale of a Tub  that is if you will not give Credit to what we tell you rather than believe your Senses G  d eternally damn you  Cibber  indeed has receiv'd some transitory Rebukes upon taking this Resolution but he still keeps firm to his Point and is resolved to carry it  REMARKS ON THE  Conscious Lovers  _I HAVE determin'd to make some Remarks with Brevity and Impartiallity upon a late Dramatick Performance call'd  The Conscious Lovers  a Comedy That I may be then certainly able to determine whether the great Success of it is owing to uncommon Merit or to those extraordinary infamous Methods which I have lately taken Notice of in a former Treatise and which if there is not a sudden Stop put to them will occasion the utter Downfal of the Stage and of all the Arts dependent on it  'Tis an Observation of  Aristotle  in the sixteenth Chapter of his  Poeticks  that there should be no Incident in the Action of a Tragedy which should be without its Reason because the Absurdity of the Incidents  would destroy the Probability of the Action and turn poetical Fiction into downright Falshood Now if upon this Account 'tis requir'd that all the Incidents should be reasonable in Tragedy 'tis still more requisite in Comedy where the Probable is more necessary and the Wonderful less tolerable But now this whole Dramatick Performance seems to me to be built upon several Things which have no Foundation either in Probability or in Reason or Nature The Father of  Indiana  whose Name is  Danvers  and who was formerly an eminent Merchant at  Bristol  upon his Arrival from the  Indies  from whence he returns with a great Estate carries on a very great Trade at  London  unknown to his Friends and Relations at  Bristol  under the Name of  Sealand  Now this Fiction without which there could be no Comedy nor any thing call'd a Comedy is not supported by Probability or by Reason or Nature 'Tis true he tells his Daughter in the fifth Act towards the Top of the d Page That when his Misfortunes drove him to the  Indies  for Reasons too tedious to be mention'd at the Time he spoke he chang'd his Name of  Danvers  into  Sealand  When his Misfortunes drove him out of his Country those Misfortunes were Reasons sufficient to account for the changing his Name But is it probable that at his Arrival in the  Indies  or at his Return to  England  with a vast Estate he should still retain the Name of  Sealand  Is it natural to believe that under that borrow'd Name he should conceal himself from his Family and all his Relations as it appears by what his Daughter says  Act  II  Page  that he does Is it credible that he could be such a Monster as never to send to  Bristol  after his Arrival from the  Indies  to enquire after his Wife his Sister and his Daughter and that he should feloniously marry a second Wife without ever knowing what was become of the first Is it reasonable to believe that if he could be absurd enough to design this he could ever possibly effect it Is it possible that a Man can return from the  Indies  with a vast Estate and the World should not know either what he is or what he was when he went thither especially when he traded to every Part of the Globe Is there so much as one Man in  England  with a vast Estate whose Original is not known Or was there ever any one great Merchant of  London  whose Family and Original was not known to the Merchants at  Bristol  when betwixt the one and the other there is always so strict and constant a Communication  But secondly the filial Obedience of young  Bevil  is carried a great deal too far He is said to be one of a great Estate and a great Understanding and yet he makes a Promise to his Father not to marry without his Consent  which is a Promise that can do his Father only a vain imaginary Good and may do him real Hurt A young Man of a great Understanding cannot but know that if he makes such a Promise he may be oblig'd to break it or perish or at least be unhappy all the rest of his Life Such a one cannot but know that he may possibly be seiz'd with a Passion so resistless and so violent that he must possess or perish and consequently if the Woman who inspires this Passion be a Woman of strict Virtue he must marry or perish or at least be mortally uneasy for the rest of his Life Children indeed before they come to Years of Discretion are oblig'd to pay a blind Obedience to their Parents But after they are come to the full Use of their Reason they are only bound to obey them in what is reasonable Indeed if a Son is in Expectation of an Estate from his Father he is engag'd to a good deal of Compliance even after he comes to Years of Discretion But that was not  Bevil  's Case He enjoy'd a very good one of his Mother's by vertue of a Marriage Article and therefore it was unreasonable in him to make such a Promise to his Father as it was unreasonable in his Father to urge him to it especially upon so sordid a Motive as the doubling a great Estate This is acting in a manner something arbitrary And it ill becomes an Author who would be thought  a Patron of Liberty to suppose that Fathers are absolute when Kings themselves are limitted If he had not an Understanding of his own to tell him this he might have learn'd from Mr  Locke  in his sixth Chapter of his admirable  Essay on Government That every Man has a Right to his natural Freedom without being subjected to the Will or Authority of any other Man Children I confess  says that great Man  are not born in this full State of Equality though they are born to it Their Parents have a sort of Rule and Jurisdiction over them when they come into the World and for some Time after but 'tis  says he  but a temporary one The Bonds of this Subjection are like the Swadling Clothes which they are wrapp'd up in and supported by in the Weakness of their Infancy Age and Reason as they grow up loosen them till at length they drop quite off and leave a Man at his own free Disposal  The same Author a little after adds  That God having given Man an Understanding to direct his Actions has allowed him a Freedom of Will and Liberty of acting as properly belonging thereunto within the Bounds of that Law he is under But while he is in an Estate wherein he has no Understanding of his own to direct his Will he is not to have any Will of his own to follow he that understands for him must will for him too he must prescribe to his Will and regulate  his Actions But when he comes to the Estate that made his Father a Freeman the Son is a Freeman too  This holds  says that great Man  in all the Laws a Man is under whether Natural or Civil Is a Man under the Law of Nature What made him free of that Law What gave him a free disposing of his Property according to his own Will within the Compass of that Law I answer a State of Maturity wherein he might be suppos'd capable to know that Law that so he might keep his Actions within the Bounds of it When he has acquir'd that State he is presum'd to know how far that Law is to be his Guide and how far he may make use of his Freedom and so comes to have it Till then some body else must guide him who is presum'd to know how far the Law allows a Liberty If such a State of Reason such an Age of Discretion made him free the same shall make his Son free too Is a Man under the Law of  England  What made him free of that Law that is to have the Liberty to dispose of his Actions and Possessions according to his own Will within the Permission of that Law A Capacity of knowing that Law which is suppos'd by that Law at the Age of Twenty one and in some Cases sooner If this made the Father free it shall make the Son free too Till then we see the Law allows the Son  to have no Will but he is to be guided by the Will of his Father or Guardian who is to understand for him And if the Father die and fail to substitute a Deputy in this Trust if he has not provided a Deputy to govern his Son during his Minority during his want of Understanding the Law takes care to do it some other must govern him and be a Will to him till he has attain'd to a State of Freedom and his Understanding be fit to take the Government of his Will But after that the Father and Son are equally free as much as a Tutor and Pupil after Nonage equally Subjects of the same Law together without any Dominion left in the Father over the Life Liberty or Estate of the Son whether they be only in the State and under the Law of Nature or under the positive Laws of an establish'd Government  I am sensible that this Quotation has been a great deal too long and yet to set the Unreasonableness of  Bevil  's Promise in a full Light I am oblig'd to add what the same Author says a little lower in the very same Chapter  viz The Power of the Father extends not to the Laws or Goods which either his Children's Industry or another's Bounty has made theirs nor to their Liberty neither when they are once arriv'd to the Enfranchisement of the Years of Discretion The Father's Empire then ceases and he can from thenceforwards no more  dispose of the Liberty of his Son than of any other Man And it must be far from an absolute or perpetual Jurisdiction from which a Man may withdraw himself having License from divine Authority to leave Father and Mother and cleave to his Wife  From what I have quoted from so judicious and so penetrating an Author I think it is pretty plain that young  Bevil  who dispos'd of part of his Estate without nay and as he might reasonably suppose against the Consent of his Father might  à fortiori  have dispos'd of his Person too if it had not been for his unreasonable Promise and that 'tis highly improbable that one of the Estate and Understanding which he is said to have should absurdly make a Promise which might possibly endanger the Happiness of his whole Life 'Tis said indeed in more than one Place of the Play that the Son has uncommon Obligations to his Father but we are neither told nor are we able to guess what those Obligations are What uncommon Obligations can a Son who has a great Estate in Possession have to a Father of so sordid a Nature as Sir  John Bevil  shews himself  Act    Page  Besides what Obligations can be binding enough to make a Man of a great Estate part with Liberty with the very Liberty of his Choice in the most important Action of his Life upon which the Happiness of all the rest depends  But as unreasonable as this Promise is which young  Bevil  made to his Father by which he gave away his Birthright his Liberty yes the very Liberty of his Choice in an Affair upon which his Happiness most depended his Behaviour to  Indiana  is still more unaccountable He loves her and is beloved by her makes constant Visits and profuse Presents to her and yet conceals his Passion from her which may be perhaps a clumsy Expedient for the Author's preparing the Discovery but is neither agreeable to Nature nor Reason For 'tis impossible that any young Man in Nature in Health and Vigour and in the Height of a violent Passion can so far command himself by the meer Force of Reason I am willing indeed to allow that he may be able to do it by the Assistance of the true Religion But the Business of a Comick Poet is only to teach Morality Grace is not taught but inspir'd The dreadful Mysteries of Christianity are but ill compatible with the Lightness and Mirth of Comedy or with the Obscenity and Prophaness of a degenerate Stage or with the Dispositions of an Assembly compos'd of Persons who have some of them no Religion and some of them not the true one Besides that nothing but a Doctrine taken from the moral Law can be a just Foundation of a Fable which every true Comedy is  Nor is such a Behaviour any more agreeable to Reason than it is to Nature  Bevil  loves  Indiana  and is beloved by her She adores him she dies for him and he knows it He observes it and observes at the same Time that so violent a Passion is attended with equal Anxiety and that Anxiety is entirely caus'd by the perplexing Doubt she is in whether she is beloved or not as appears by what he says himself  Act    p  Why then doth he not declare himself and by that Declaration compose her Mind and qualify her to expect with Patience the Benefit of Time 'Tis indeed true that he had promis'd his Father never to marry without his Consent while his Father liv'd but he had not promis'd him never to love without his Consent for that would have been a ridiculous Promise a Promise the Performance of Nonperformance of which was not in his own Power and would depend entirely on what the People call  Chance  and what Philosophers call  Providence  What could he mean then by not declaring himself As the Love he had conceiv'd for  Indiana  was no Breach of the Promise he had made to his Father so neither could he violate it by any Declaration of that Passion What then once more can he mean by his Silence His only reasonable way of proceeding had been to acquaint not only his Mistress but his Father and all the World with the Passion  which he felt for her and with the Necessity he was in to marry her or to be for ever miserable Such a Declaration was not at all inconsistent with his Duty and if his Father had either Reason or Compassion would have caus'd him to relent and to release his Son from a Promise the persevering in which must prove unhappy or fatal to him If it should be said that such a Concealment of his Passion was necessary that he might make a Retreat with Honour in Case his Father should still be obstinate to this I answer That there was no Retreat for him unless he would at the same time retreat from Virtue and Honour that his Behaviour had fix'd and determined him that by his Generosity and constant Visits he had raised the Passion of  Indiana  to such a Height that his leaving her would in all likelihood be followed by Madness or by Selfmurder or by dreadful Hysterical Symptoms as deplorable as either of which what passes between her Father and her in the fifth Act is a sufficient Proof Beside that such a Retreat would prove as fatal to her Honour as to her Person He had for some time made constant Visits he had made very extravagant Presents to her he had made no Declaration of the Affection he had for her either to her or to her Aunt  Isabella  or acquainted any one with his Design to marry her if he could obtain his Father's  Consent Now can any thing be more plain than that such a Behaviour if he left her would ruin the Reputation of the poor Lady and cause all the World to entertain such Thoughts of her as  Sealand  and  Myrtle  had already express'd And thus I have endeavour'd to shew that the Behaviour of  Bevil  to  Indiana  in his concealing his Passion from her is as ridiculously whimsical as that of  Cimberton  to her Sister  Lucinda  The Catastophre I must confess is very moving but it would be more so if it were rightly and reasonably handled because it would be much more surprizing For the Surprize is in a good Measure prevented by the Behaviour of  Isabella  upon the first Appearance of  Sealand  which if it had not been out of all Probability and Nature would have prevented it more It was highly in Nature and Probability that  Isabella  upon the first discovering her Brother should fly into an excessive Transport of Joy and have run to embrace him for when she is made to say That her Brother must not know her yet she is made to give no Reasons for it nor can the Audience imagine any 'Tis not  Isabella  who says that but the Author who clumsily uses it to serve a Turn for if she had discover'd herself to her Brother at his first Appearance it had prevented the Audience's Sorrow and Compassion for the imaginary Distress of  Indiana    and consequently their return to Joy But as  Aristotle  and all the great Criticks after him have taught us that there is to be no Incident in a Dramatick Poem but what must be founded on Reason it happens as we observ'd above very unluckily here that there is no Incident in the  Conscious Lovers  but what is attended by some great Absurdity For the Action of  Indiana  in throwing away her Bracelet is of the same Stamp and is entirely the Author's and not the Dramatick Person's for it was neither necessary nor profitable that  Indiana  in the Height of her Agony should so much as think of her Bracelet or if she did think of it should resolve to throw away the greatest Token that she had to remember her dead Mother for whose Memory her Grief and Distress ought naturally to renew and redouble her Tenderness But the Author is obliged to have Recourse to this as an awkard Expedient tho' the best he could find to bring on the Discovery But had he known any thing of the Art of the Stage he would have known that those Discoveries are but dully made which are made by Tokens that they ought necessarily or probably to spring from the whole Train of the Incidents contrary to our Expectation And how easy was it to bring that about here For such a Discovery had been very well prepared by what young  Bevil  says to  Humphrey  in the  first Act and by the Hint  Indiana  gives to  Sealand  in the fifth Act which Hint the old Gentleman readily takes for when she tells him she had been made an Infant Captive on the Seas he immediately crys out  An Infant Captive  and after some Interruption given by  Indiana  he says  Dear Lady O yet one Moment's Patience my Heart grows full with your Affliction but yet there is something in your Story that  She answers as if she were at cross Purposes  My Portion here is Bitterness and Sorrow  To which he replies  Do not think so Pray answer me Does  Bevil  know your Name and Family  So that a few Questions more pertinently answer'd would have brought on the Discovery Now if the Discovery had been made this Way and  Isabella  had not known her Brother at her first seeing him but had come in to  Sealand  and  Indiana  just after the Discovery had been made there would have been two Surprizes both greater and more agreeable than now they are and both of them without Absurdity  But now the Mention of the Infant Captive brings to my Remembrance the Circumstances of that Captivity which are to use Mr  Cimberton  's Expression pregnant with Absurdity  Indiana  it seems with her Mother and her Aunt are taken in their Passage to the  Indies  by a Privateer from  Toulon  and carried into that Place Now  where were they taken It must be either in the Channel or on the Ocean Now in the first place I never heard that  Toulon  set out any Privateers Secondly Suppose they did 'tis improbable that a Privateer from  Toulon  should cruize in the Ocean and much more improbable that they should rove as far as the Channel Thirdly 'Tis highly improbable that an  EastIndia  Vessel which had Force enough to venture without a Convoy should be taken by a Privateer Fourthly 'Tis not a Jot more probable that supposing a Privateer from  Toulon  should have taken such a Vessel it should chuse to carry it into  Toulon  rather than into  Brest  or  St Malo  For how long must a Privateer be carrying an  EastIndia  Vessel from the Channel to  Toulon  which is above a thousand Miles from the Channel and little less distant from that Part of the Ocean o'er which our  EastIndia  Ships pass Now in so long a Voyage the Privateer might very well be taken and the Prize be retaken whereas the latter might be carried to  Brest  or  St Malo  with a hundred Times less Danger  Well But let us suppose the Privateer got safely with his Prize into  Toulon  Does Sir  Richard  believe that  Toulon  is situate under one of the Poles that neither Ship nor Passengers were heard of in so many Years If  Indiana  was an Infant  Isabella  was old enough to write and if she was so indifferent  or stupid as to omit it the Captain of the Ship and his Mate would not fail to write to their Owners to let them know the Fate of their Ship If there was no Passage for Letters directly thro'  France  yet the Way of  Holland  was open and upon the Arrival of those Letters not only the whole  EastIndia  Company but all  London  would have known what was become of the Ship at a Time when so many NewsWriters contended which could furnish the Town with most and the freshest News So that if  Sealand  upon his coming from the  Indies  had made but never so little Enquiry he would have found that his Sister and Daughter had been at  Toulon  If he had made no Enquiry he must have shewn himself a fine Gentleman indeed who would marry a second Wife before he was certain the first was dead And it is impossible he could know that the first was dead without knowing that his Sister and his Daughter were at  Toulon  I shall now compare the Relation that old  Bevil  makes to his Man  Humphrey  in the first Scene of the  Conscious Lovers  to that which  Simo  makes to  Sosia  in the beginning of the  Andria  But I shall only compare them at present with relation to the Incidents I shall take an Oportunity afterwards to consider the Sentiments and Expressions by themselves  The beginning of the  Andria  is perfectly in Nature  Simo  begins the Relation which he makes to  Sosia  with a grave and a solemn Air suitable to the Disposition of Mind he is in and the great Concern he is under Old  Bevil  who is suppos'd to be in the same Disposition of Mind and to lie under the same Concern begins the Relation which he makes to  Humphrey  with an Impertinence dully gay and therefore the beginning of the  Conscious Lovers  is entirely out of  Nature  In the  Andria    Chremes  a rich old  Athenian  Citizen offers to bestow his only Daughter  Philumena  with a great Dowry on  Pamphilus  the Son of  Simo  who accepts that Offer for his Son The Match breaks off upon the Discovery which  Pamphilus  makes at the Funeral of  Chrysis  of his Passion for  Glycerium Simo  the Father pretends that it still goes on that he may take an Opportunity from his Son's Refusal of giving him a severe Reprimand  Si propter amorem uxorem nolit ducere  Ea primum ab illo animadvertenda Injuria est  Et nunc id operam do ut per falsas Nuptias  Vera objurgandi Causa sit si deneget  In the beginning of the  Conscious Lovers  there is a very absurd Imitation of this Passage in  Terence  Where old  Bevil  speaks  thus to his Man  Humphrey  concerning his Son  If there is so much in this Amour of his that he denies upon my Summons to marry I shall have Cause enough to be offended And then by insisting upon his marrying to Day I shall know how far he is engag'd to the Lady in Masquerade and from thence only shall be able to take my Measures  Now it seems plain to me that  Simo  would have reason to be angry at his Son's Refusal and that old  Bevil  would have none  Pamphilus  would refuse a Wife with a great Dowry which he wanted having nothing but what his Father supply'd him with who perhaps might not be very easy in his own Circumstances Besides  Glycerium  pass'd for a Courtezan which was not the Case of  Indiana  because she was believ'd to be the Sister of  Chrysis  who was publickly known to be one And it would provoke any Father of a good Family and who had all along liv'd with Reputation in the World to find to the Ruin and Disgrace of that Family his only Son married to a Whore or living with her as if he were married to her which was against both Law and Custom at  Athens  and a great deal more scandalous there than it is in this Blessed Town as is evident from what  Simo  says in that admirable Scence which is between him and his Son and  Chremes  in  the fifth Act of this Comedy where Nature is drawn with such masterly Strokes and in such lively and glowing Colours  Adeo n'impotentiesse animo ut praeter Civium  Morem atque legem sui voluntatem patris  Tamen hanc habere studeat cum summo probro  But 'tis downright ridiculous in old  Bevil  to pretend to be offended in Case his Son who is in Possession of a great Estate and entirely independant on his Father and one whom the Father himself calls a sober and discreet Gentleman should refuse to marry at a Minute's Warning a Woman whom he does not like and whom the Father chuses only with the sordid View of doubling a great Estate when what they had already was more than sufficient Because the Father is sordid must the Son be unhappy Must the Son who has bespoke a Dish for himself take up with another that is his Aversion only because his Father chooses it The Passion which young  Bevil  had for another is a just Cause of his Refusal and if his Father is unreasonably offended the Son who has no Dependance upon him may very reasonably be comforted As the Father knew very well that the Son had no Occasion for the Wealth which would come from the marrying  Lucinda  so he did not believe his frequenting  Indiana  whether he suppos'd her an honorable  or a kept Mistress would bring any Scandal either upon himself or his Family Witness what he says to  Sealand  in  Act    Page  concerning this very Affair  viz Sir I can't help saying that what might injure a Citizen's Credit may be no Stain to a Gentleman's Honour  So that 'tis plain  Simo  had two important Reasons to be offended at his Son's Refufal which old  Bevil  apparently had not because he rejected Wealth which he wanted and courted Infamy for which no one can have an Occasion  The Relation of what passed between young  Bevil  and  Indiana  at the Masquerade is a very absurd Imitation of what passed between  Pamphilus  and  Glycerium  at the Funeral of  Chrysis Pamphilus  attends  Glycerium  to the Funeral of  Chrysis  who pass'd for her Sister While the Body was burning  Glycerium  in the Agony of her Grief ran to the Fire and was about to throw herself into it when  Pamphilus  half dead with Fear runs to her catches hold of her throws his Arms about her and by that Action and his tender Expostulation discovers the Violence of that Passion which he had hitherto conceal'd upon which  Glycerium  by an Action which manifested her habitual Love weeping reclin'd her Head upon his Breast with a most moving Tenderness This is the Sense of that celebrated Passage But is but  barely the Sense for no Pen no Tongue can express the Elegance and the Grace of  Terence  But now let us see the Imitation of this in the  Conscious Lovers  'Tis in the first Scene of the Play where old  Bevil  relates to his Man  Hump  ey  what passed at the last Masquerade  Sir J Bevil  You know I was last  Thursday  at the Masquerade my Son you may remember soon found us out He knew his Grandfather's Habit which I then wore and tho' it was the Mode in the last Age yet the Maskers you know follow'd us as if we had been the most monstrous Figures in the whole Assembly  Humphrey  I remember indeed a young Man of Quality in the Habit of a Clown that was particularly trouble some  Sir J Bevil  Right He was too much what he seemed to be  Humphrey  I knew he had a Mind to come to that Particular  Aside  Sir J Bevil  Ay he followed us till the Gentleman who led the Lady in the  Indian  Mantle presented that gay Creature to the Rustick and bid him like  Cymon  in the Fable grow polite by falling in Love and let that worthy old Gentleman alone meaning me The Clown was not reform'd but rudely persisted and offer'd to force off my Mask with that the Gentleman throwing off his own appear'd to be my Son and in his Concern for me tore off that of the Nobleman  At this they seiz'd each other The Company called the Guards and in the Surprise the Lady swooned away upon which my Son quitted his Adversary and had now no Care but of the Lady when raising her in his Arms art thou gone cried he for everForbid it HeavenShe revives at his known Voiceand with the most familiar tho' modest Gesture hangs in Safety over his Shoulder weeping but wept as in the Arms of one before whom she could give herself a Loose were she not under Observation while she hides her Face in his Neck he carefully conveys her from the Company  Now there is this remarkable Difference between what pass'd at the Funeral and what pass'd at the Masquerade that every Thing that relates to the former seems to be either necessary or profitable and almost every Thing that relates to the latter appears to be improbable How injudicious an Imitation is the Behaviour of  Indiana  at the Masquerade of the Behaviour of  Glycerium  at the Funeral Nothing can be more natural than the Freedom which  Glycerium  takes with  Pamphilus  She lov'd him and was belov'd by him She was betroth'd to him She had no Reserve for him The utmost Familiarities had pass'd between them She was with Child by him and expected every Day  that the Time of her being deliver'd was come  The Case of  Indiana  is very different and her Behaviour is very inconsistent with her Character 'tis true she was in Love with young  Bevil  but doubted very much whether that Love was reciprocal he had been so far from taking the same Liberty with her that  Pamphilus  had done with  Glycerium  that his Behaviour had been always very respectful and yet  Indiana  uses the same Familiarity upon this Occasion with him that  Glycerium  at the Funeral does with  Pamphilus  she revives at his known Voice which she heard it seems after she had lost all her Senses and comes from Death to Life upon it like the dead Men in the  Rehearsal  at the Voice of Poet  Bays  and with the most familiar tho' modest Gesture hangs in Safety over his Shoulder weeping but wept as in the Arms of one before whom she could give herself a Loose were she not under Observation and while she hides her Face in his Neck he carefully conveys her from the Company  Now this Behaviour is by no means consistent with the Character of  Indiana  familiar and modest are not in this Case very compatible and then what does Sir  Richard  mean by  wept as in the Arms of one before whom she could give herself a Loose  If these Words have any Meaning I would fain know what it is  In this first Scene there is another very ridiculous Imitation of what  Simo  says to  Sosia  in the first Scene of the  Andria  Simo  Et nunc id operam do ut per falsas nuptias  Vera objurgandi causa sit si degenet  Simul sceleratus Davus si quid Consilî  Habet ut consumat nunc cum nihil obsint doli  Quem ego credo manibus pedibusque obnixè omnia  Facturum magis id adeo mihi ut incommodet  Quàm ut obsequatur Gnato  Sos  Quapropter  Si  Rogas  Mala mens malus animus  Nunc tuum est officium has bene ut adsimules nuptias  Perterrefacias Davum observes filium  Quid agat quid cum illo consilii captet  Thus have I gone thro' the whole Train of Incidents which are a Heap of Absurdities and Inconsistences I have partly likewise gone thro' the Character of young  Bevil  who is made up of Contradictions He is one who differs from himself as much as from the rest of the World This Man of Conscience and of Religion is as arrant an Hypocrite as a certain Author 'Tis indeed a pleasant Religion that never seizes a Man but when he is upon the Point either of Love  or Battle This Man of Conscience and of Religion dissembles with his Father most vilely which Religion doth by no means allow and so chuses rather to offend Heaven than an old sordid Blockhead who pretends to treat one who is independent of him and at Years of Discretion like an arrant Boy yet this the Son calls an honest Dissimulation as he calls Breach of Trust the getting over a false Point of Honour In the first Scene of the second Act this Man of Religion is putting  Myrtle  upon a Fraud and palming two counterfeit Lawyers upon old Mrs  Sealand  a Practice which Religion and Morality both abhor  The Character of young  Bevil  therefore is made up of Qualities either incoherent and contradictory as Religion and Dissimulation Morality and Fraud or most ridiculously consistent as Circumspection and Folly For one may say the same thing of young  Bevil  that  Scandal  in  Love for Love  says of and to  Foresight    That if ever he commits an Error 'tis not without a great deal of Consideration Circumspection and Caution  The Character therefore of young  Bevil  is not an Image of any thing in Life and especially in common Life as every thing in Comedy ought to be but the Phantom of a feverish Author's Brain as several of the other Characters likewise are  As young  Bevil  is the Character of such a young Man as is not to be found in the World upon the foot of Nature of which all true Poetry is a just Imitation  Cimberton  is a Creature who is set as much below Humanity as  Bevil  appears to be drawn above it he is an Animal that is nothing so like a Man as a Monkey is nor is he near so well qualified to entertain a Lady agreeably he is so very monstrous that one would not think he could be produced by any thing that had human Shape and for the Credit of Human Nature ought like a  Sooterkin  to be demolished as soon as he appears  Most of the other Characters are faintly and coarsly drawn which is very strange if we consider the admirable Patterns that  Terence  has laid before him The Characters of that Comick Poet I must confess are in no great Compass but tho' they are few they are excellent they are so strong in Nature that they may be taken for the Life may be taken for Persons rather than Pictures and for real rather than dramatick Persons Sir  Richard  seems to be wholly ignorant of what  Boileau  has said of this Matter who is one of the greatest of the  French  Poets and one of the justest of their Criticks  Aux depens du bon Sens gardez de plaisanter  Jamais de la Nature il ne faut s'ecarter  Contemplez de quel Air un pere dans Terence  Vient d'un Fils amoreux gourmander l'imprudence  De quel Air cet Amant ecoute ses leçons  Et court chez sa Maistresse oublier ces chansons  Ce n'est pas un portrait une image semblable  C'est un Amant un Fils un Pere veritable  That is  Beware of being pleasant at the Expence of good Sense and take care that you never go out of Nature Observe with what an Air a Father in  Terence  reprimands his amorous Son for his imprudent Conduct with what Air the Lover hearkens to his grave Remonstrances then runs away to his Mistress to laugh at these musty Morals You would swear that you had before you the Things themselves instead of a good Picture and a just Resemblance you would swear you had before you a real Lover a real Son and a real Father  The very Character of  Simo  in the  Andria  is admirable and the Relation he makes to  Sosia  a Masterpiece I never read it but I see the old  Athenian  before my Eyes in the very same Colours that  Davus  paints  Crito  the  Andrian  in the same Comedy  Cum faciem videas videtur esse quantivis pretii  Tristis severitas inest in voltu
