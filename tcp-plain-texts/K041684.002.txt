 LONDON Printed for GEORGE KEARSLEY at Johnson's Head Fleetstreet MDCCLXXXV  GARRICK's POEMS  VOLUME THE SECOND  LVI PROLOGUE to DIDO  A Tragedy by Mr Reed acted at Drurylane March  for Mr Holland's Benefit    Spoken by Mr KING  A Ropemaker a Poetwrite a play  O hang the blockhead wicked wits will say  Before you turn him offa word I pray  Genius is not to place or state fix'd down  But flies at random all about the town  Now at Whitehall now at St James's smiles  Then whisks to Wapping or to Broad St Giles  O let not prejudice rank weed take root  Which may of Genius choak the fairest fruit  If none but gentlemen highborn must write  I fear we soon should wish you all good night  Shakespeare and Johnson our Dramatick Lords  Did they amuse themselves with twisting cords  Were they fine gentlemenO noOld Ben  Was famous for his trowel as his pen  With mortar and the Muse he pass'd his days  And built good walls before he built good plays  Shakespeare a genius born his taste was such  Too exquisite he lov'd fat buck too much  And he whose matchless muse can soften rocks  Fled to Parnassus to avoid the Stocks  Now to the Ropemaker I come again  Who having spun much hemp now spins his brain  This  hempen  produce any test will stand  This of his brain may prove a rope of sand  But should this spinning of his head deceive him  This hempen manufacture may relieve him  Had I but time to give my fancy scope  I'd shew how  tragedy  was like a  rope  How several parts well twisted make a whole  To curb the passions and to melt the soul  The cause of justice each alike befriends  Both salutary means for moral ends  Thus the most crabbed  Critic  plainly sees  That making  Ropes  is writing  Tragedies  And should he fail to please poor scribbling els  Othen he makes a rope to hang himself  LVII LINCO's TRAVELS  An Interlude acted at Drurylane for Mr King's Benefit April    Linco  Mr KING  Dorcas  Mrs BRADSHAW  Enter  Arcadian  Men and Women and among them  Dorcas  gathering about  Linco  CHORUS of ARCADIANS  WELCOME Linco welcome home  Linco  Happy am I that am come  Tho' I've been in countries rare  Seen such sights would make you stare  Arcadian  Tell us tell us  Linco  Give me air to blow my bellows  Arcadian  Tell us tell us  Linco  A moment spare  Arcad  Make your neighbours some amends  Linco  Never more I'll wander  Simple silly gander  From my flock and cackling friends  Shakes hands and kisses the women  Chorus  Welcome Linco welcome home  Linco  Don't crowd so neighbours you confound me  Stand back and make a circle round me  I'll move my elbows in the center  And on my travels thus I enter  O yeskeep silence old and young  Do you find ears while I find tongue  Dorcas  I am so deaf I must come near thee  Approaches  Linco  And pray be dumb or you'll not hear me  Seiz'd with a strange desire of gadding  Which sets your Englishmen a madding  I rather chose like them to roam  To play the fool than stay at home  But tho' like them abroad I rov'd  I'm not return'd so much improv'd  ironically  Dorcas  Those English folks are very strange  Linco  In politicks much giv'n to change  They are in temper like the weather  Fair storm foul sunshine all together  Strange contradictions gay and sad  Mop'd merry moody wise and mad  A strange hodgepodge of good and bad  Dorcas  'Tis said they are so sierce and bold  No woman's safe  Linco  Unless she's old  Dorcas  I hate such wantonness and riot  Linco  You'd live among 'em very quiet  loud  Arcadian  But are they so prodigious stout  Linco  Best go and try 'em if you doubt  Be honest and they'll kindly treat you  Be pert and saucy and they'll beat you  If you dissect an English skull  Of politicks 'tis so brimful  Of papers pamphlets prose and verse  The furniture can't well be worse  So furious are they to be free  Nothing so common as to see  Britons deaddrunk for liberty  This draws the sword of Englishmen  Of Englishwomen draws the pen  I ne'er shall see such folks again  Their very children on the lap  Are fed with liberty and pap  But hold  True traveliers have various ways  To ease their bonesthey quit their chaise  To mount a horse and pace along  So I to ease my halftir'd tongue  Leave doggrel trot to pace it in a song  AIR  I saw sprightly France  That nation so gay  Where they sing and they dance  All their sorrows away  For with fal lal la  And ha ha ha  They drive sorrow away  II  The German so brave  Not a smile must come near  When they laugh they are grave  'Tis thus with mynheer  They fal lal la  And ha ha ha  Nicht laughter mynheer  III  The Italians so sly  Have one simple plan  On your purse they keep eye  And their hand if they can  If you fal lal lal  Then they fal lal lal  So Signor Signora if they can  IV  But England's strange folk  Are my greatest delight  They'll scold and they'll joke  Shake hands and they'll fight  One moment fal lal lal  The next fal lal lal  Curse kiss you and fight  I will now leave my horse and my chaise for a time  And will foot it for change in prose tagg'd with rhyme  Arcadian  Of England tell more what their sport and their trade is  Dorcas  And tell us good Linco some news of their ladies  Linco  Their women are fair but fantastical grown  To Dame Nature owe much would they let her alone  They challenge the world for good hearts and sweet faces  But use all their  tongues  as they do in  all places  For their sports they have plays where all ranks and degrees  Take places to sweat to be squeez'd and to squeeze  'Tis strange but 'tis true what I saw with my eye  They give money to laugh and what's stranger  to cry  They build 'em fine places to meet in and talk  To walk round and round and then round and round walk  When tir'd to drink tea and to eat butter'd bread  Then again round and round and go home almost dead  Of all human things there a traffic is made  Religion law physicknay beauty's a trade  Arcadian  Beauty  starts  Linco  Yes beauty I sayat midnight you'll meet  Kind damsels who offer their charms in the street  "  Ah so you where go you Sir pray stay a while  "  Then so softly they talk and so sweetly they smile  That they tempt you to buy by alluring approaches  Such females are hir'd as they hire hackney coaches  Dorcas  Fye for shame for their kingdom they should not have me  Linco  In that my good dame you and they will agree  For ev'ry disorder they'll publish a cure  Whose virtue much pussing and swearing insure  Should he kill the poor patient the doctor must gain  And still have good tradefor the dead won't complain  Tho' they talk of their rights which they'll fight for and die  Yet to know what's their right to the law they apply  For two bits of gold a black gown reads your case  Hums and haws and thus speaks with a wise pucker'd face  That coat on your back you have bought and may use it    'Tis prov'd the next day 'tis not mine and I  lose it  Among these green bags if you are not alert  With your coat you may lose both your waistcoat and shirt  And happy I am that I've brought home my skin  Dorcas  To forsake all your friends was a shame and a sin  Leave roving and make your own country your wife  Linco  From this moment I wed her and take her for life  Shall quit all the world and think her the most comely  For home is still home tho' never so homely  SONG  I'll never go abroad again  Nor ever will I roam  For he has but a flimsy brain  Who wanders far from home  See nine in ten  Of Englishmen  Who run the nations o'er  Tho' pert and gay  Yet pray are they  Much wiser than before  Chorus  See nine in ten c c  II  Contented here I'll pass my life  For roving's but a curse  I'll take my country for a wife  For better and for worse  See nine in ten  Of Englishmen  Who run the nations o'er  Tho' pert and gay  Yet pray are they  Much wiser than before  Chorus  See nine in ten c c  III  While I can see such sights as these  And such a harvest bring  And while I can my betters please  For ever will I sing  That nine in ten  Of Englishmen  Who chuse abroad to roam  Among mankind  Will ever find  The worth they leave at home  Chorus  See nine in ten c c  LVIII PROLOGUE to the TAYLORS  A Tragedy for warm weather the Author unknown acted at the Haymarket July    Spoken by Mr FOOTE  THIS night we add some heroes to our store  Who never were as heroes seen before  No blustering Romans Trojans Greeks shall rage  No knights arm'd capapee shall croud our stage  Nor shall our Henrys Edwards take the field  Opposing sword to sword and shield to shield  With different instruments our troop appears  Needles to thimbles shall and sheers to sheers  With parchment gorgets and in buckram arm'd  Coldblooded taylors are to heroes warm'd  And slipshod slide to warNo lyon's glare  No eyeballs darting fire shall make you stare  Each outside shall belye the stuff within  A Roman spirit in a taylor's skin  A taylorlegg'd Cassius Pompey shall you see  And the ninth part of Brutus strut in me  What tho' no swords we draw no daggers shake  Yet can our warriors  a quiet us make  With a bare bodkin  Now be dumb ye railers  And never but in honour call out taylors  But are these heroes tragic you will cry  Oh very tragic and I'll tell you why  Should female artists with the male combine  And mantuamakers to the taylors join  Should all too proud to work their trades give o'er  Nor to be soften'd by the sixpence more  What horrors would ensue First you ye beaux  At once lose all existence with your cloaths  Then you ye fair where would be your defence  This is no golden age of innocence  Should drunken bacchanals the Graces meet  And no  police  to guard the naked street  Beauty is weak and passion bold and strong  Oh thenbut modesty restrains my tongue  May this night's bard a skilful taylor be  And like a wellmade coat his tragedy  Tho'  close  yet  easy decent  but not  dull  Short  but not  scanty  without  buckram  FULL  LIX PROLOGUE To A PEEP BEHIND THE CURTAIN  A Farce by Mr Garrick acted at Drurylane October    Spoken by Mr KING  BOLD is the man and  compos mentis  scarce  Who in these nicer times dares write a farce  A vulgar longforgotten taste renew  All now are comedies five acts or two  Authors have ever in a certain strain  Begg'd mercy for the bantling of their brain  That you kind nurse would fondle't on your lap  And rear it with applause that best of pap  Thus babes have in their cradle 'scap'd a blow  Tho' lame and ricketty from top to toe  Our bard with prologue outworks has not fenc'd him  For all that I shall say will make against him  Imprimis  this his piecea farce we call it  Ergo  'tis low and ten to one you maul it  Would you because 'tis low no quarter give  Blackguards as well as gentlemen should live  'Tis downright English toonothing from France  Except some beasts which treat you with a dance  With a Burletta too we shall present you  And not Italianthat will discontent you  Nay what is worseyou'll see it and must know it  I Thomas King of Kingstreet am the poet  The murder's out the murderer detected  And in one night be try'd condemn'd dissected  'Tis said for Scandal's tongue will never cease  That mischief's meant against our little piece  Let me look round I'll tell you how the case is  There's not one frown a single brow disgraces  I never saw a sweeter set of faces  Suppose Old Nick before you righteous folk  Produce a farce brimful of mirth and joke  Tho' he at other times would fire your blood  You'd clap his piece and swear 'twas dev'lish good  Malice prepense'tis falseit cannot be  Light is my heart from apprehensions free  If you would save Old Nick you'll never damn poor me  LX ADDRESS to the TOWN by way of EPILOGUE to A PEEP behind the CURTAIN  Spoken by Mr KING  ALL fable is figureI your bard will maintain it  And lest you don't know it 'tis fit I explain it  The lyre of our Orpheus means your approbation  Which frees the poor poet from care and vexation  Should want make his mistress too keen to dispute  Your smiles fill his pocketsand madam is mute  Should his wife that's himself for they two are but one  Be in hell that's in debt and the money all gone  Your favour brings comfort at once cures the evil  For 'scaping bumbailiffs is 'scaping the devil  Nay Cerberus critics their fury will drop  For such barking monsters your smiles are a sop  But now to explain what you most will require  That cows sheep and calves should dance after the lyre  Without your kind favour how scanty each meal  But with it comes dancing beef mutton and veal  For sing it or say it this truth we all see  Your applause will be ever  the true Beaume de Vie  LXI PROLOGUE to FALSE DELICACY  A Comedy by Mr Kelly acted at Drurylane January    Spoken by Mr KING  I'M vex'd quite vex'd and you'll be vex'dthat's worse  To deal with stubborn scribblers there's the curse  Write moral playsthe blockheadwhy good people  You'll soon expect this house to wear a steeple  For our fine piece to let you into facts  Is quite a  Sermon  only preach'd in  Acts  You'll scarce believe me 'till the proof appears  But even I Tom Fool must shed some tears  Do ladies look upon menay no simp'ring  Think you this face was ever made for whimp'ring  Can I a cambrick handkerchief display  Thump my unfeeling breast and roar away  Why  this is comical  perhaps you'll say  Resolving this strange aukward bard to pump  I ask'd him what he meant He somewhat plump  New purs'd his belly and his lips thus biting  I must keep up the dignity of writing  You may but if you do sir I must tell ye  You'll not keep up that dignity of belly  Still he preach'd on"Bards of a former age  " Held up abandon'd pictures on the stage  " Spread out their wit with fascinating art  " And catch'd the fancy to corrupt the heart  " But happy changein these more moral days  " You cannot sport with virtue even in plays  " On Virtue's side his pen the poet draws  " And boldly asks a hearing for his cause"  Thus did he prance and swell The man may prate  And feed these whimsies in his addle pate  That you'll protect his muse because she's good  A virgin and so chasteO lud O lud  No muse the critic beadle's lash escapes  Tho' virtuous if a Dowdy and a Trapes  If  his  come forth a decent likely lass  You'll speak her fair and grant the proper pass  Or should his brain be turn'd with wild pretences  In three hours time you'll bring him to his senses  And well you may when in your power you get him  In that short space you blister bleed and sweat him  Among the Turks indeed he'd run no danger  They sacred hold a madman and a stranger  LXII EPILOGUE to FALSE DELICACY  Spoken by Mrs DANCER  WHEN with the Comic Muse a bard hath dealing  The traffic thrives when there's a mutual feeling  Our Author boasts that well he chose his plan  False modesty  Himself an  Irishman  As I'm a woman somewhat prone to satire  I'll prove it all a  bull  what he calls nature  And you I'm sure will join before you go  To maul  False Modesty  from  Dublin ho  Where are these Lady Lambtons to be found  Not in these riper times on English ground  Among the various flowers which sweetly blow  To charm the eyes at Almac's and Soho  Pray does that weed False Delicacy grow Oh no  Among the fair of fashion common breeding  Is there one bosom where love lies a bleeding  In  olden  times your grannams unrefin'd  Ty'd up the tongue put padlocks on the mind  O ladies thank your stars there's nothing now confin'd  In love you English  men  there's no concealing  Are most like Winworth simple in your dealing  But Britons in their natures as their names  Are diff'rent as the Shannon Tweed and Thames  As the Tweed flows the bonny Scot proceeds  Wunds slaw and sure and nae obstruction heeds  Tho' oft' repuls'd his purpose still hauds fast  Stecks like a burr and wuns the lass at last  The Shannon rough and vig'rous pours along  Like the bold accents of brave Paddy's tongue  Arrah dear craturecan you scorn me so  Cast your sweet eyes upon me top and toe  Not fancy mepoohthat's all game and laughter  First marry me my jewelhoyou'll love me after  Like his own Thames honest John Trott their brother  More quick than one and much less bold than t'other  Gentle not dull his loving arms will spread  But stoptin willows hides his bashful head  John leaves his home resolv'd to tell his pain  HesitatesIlove  fye sir 'tis in vain  John blushes turns him round and whistles home again  Well is my painting like or do you doubt it  What say you to a tryallet's about it  Let Cupid lead three Britons to the field  And try which first can make a damsel yield  What say you to a widowsmile consent  And she'll be ready for experiment  LXIII EPILOGUE to ZENOBIA  A Tragedy by Mr Murphy acted at Drurylane February    Spoken by Mrs ABINGTON  She peeps through the Curtain  HOW do you all good folksin tears for certain  I'll only take a peep behind the curtain  You're all so full of tragedy and sadness  For me to come among ye would be madness  This is no time for gigglingwhen you've leisure  Call out for me and I'll attend your pleasure  As soldiers hurry at the beat of drum  Beat but your hands that instant I will come  She enters upon their clapping  This is so good to call me out so soon  The Comic Muse by me intreats a boon  She call'd for Pritchard her first maid of honour  And begg'd of her to take the task upon her  But she I'm sure you'll all be sorry for't  Resigns her place and soon retires from court  Mrs Pritchard had at this time signified her intention of retiring from the stage    To bear this loss we courtiers make a shift  When good folks leave us worse may have a lift  The Comic Muse whose ev'ry smile is grace  And her stage sister with her tragic face  Have had a quarreleach has writ  a case  And on their friends assembled now I wait  To give you of their  difference a true state  Alluding to the titles of the pamphlets published at this period by the contending managers of Coventgarden Messrs Colman Powell Harris and Rutherford    Melpomene complains when she appears  For five good Acts in all her pomp of tears  To raise your souls and with her raptures wing 'em  Nay wet your handkerchiefs that you may wring 'em  Some flippant hussey like myself comes in  Crack goes her fan and with a giggling grin  Hey Presto passall topsyturvy see  For ho ho ho is chang'd to he he he  We own the fault but 'tis a fault in vogue  'Tis theirs who call and bawl forEpilogue  O shame upon youfor the time to come  Know better and go miserable home  What says our Comic Goddesswith reproaches  She vows her sister Tragedy encroaches  And spite of all her virtue and ambition  Is known to have an am'rous disposition  For in False Delicacywond'rous sly  Join'd with a certain IrishmanO fye  She made you when you ought to laugh to cry  Her sister's smiles with tears she try'd to smother  Rais'd such a tragicomic kind of pother  You laugh'd with one eye while you cry'd with t'other  What can be donesad work behind the scenes  There Comic females scold with Tragic Queens  Each party different ways the foe assails  These shake their daggers those prepare their nails  'Tis you alone must calm those dire mishaps  Or we shall still continue pulling caps  What is your willI read it in your faces  That all hereafter take their proper places  Shake hands and kiss and friends andburn their cases  LXIV  In Mr Keate's poems vol ii p is an Epilogue written by that gentleman for Mrs Pritchard before he knew that Mr Garrick had already supplied one Mrs Pritchard survived only until August following when she died at Bath She had been years on the stage Her very extraordinary powers and her infinite variety gave her the justest claim to be remembered as one of the most distinguished actresses that perhaps any country ever produced and her uncommon talents for the Theatre were not more the admiration of the publick than the amiableness of her private life was that of her acquaintance  Mrs PRITCHARD's Farewell EPILOGUE spoken on Monday the th April at Drurylane Theatre  THE curtain droptmy mimic life is past  That scene of  The last scene of Lady Macbeth  sleep and terror was my last  Could I in such a scene my exit make  When ev'ry real feeling is awake  Which beating here superior to all art  Bursts in full tides from a most grateful heart  I now appear myself distress'd dismay'd  More than in all the characters I've play'd  In acted passion tears must SEEM to flow  " But I have that within that passeth shew"  Before I go and this lov'd spot forsake  What gratitude can give my wishes take  Upon your hearts may no affliction prey  Which cannot by the stage be chas'd away  And may the stage to please each virtuous mind  Grow ev'ry day more moral more refin'd  Refin'd from grossness not by foreign skill  Weed out the poison but be English still  To all my brethren whom I leave behind  Still may your bounty as to me be kind  To me for many years your favours flow'd  Humbly receiv'don small desert bestow'd  For which I feelwhat cannot be express'd  Words are too weakmy tears must speak the rest  LXV PROLOGUE to ZINGIS  A Tragedy by Mr Dow acted at Drurylane December    Spoken by Mrs ABINGTON  I'M sent good folks to speak the Epilogue  But 'tis so dullI'll cheat the scribbling rogue  Among ourselves your loss will be but small  You're  To the Boxes  too polite for Epilogue to call  But as for  you  To the Gallery  it is your joy and pride  Ever to call but never satisfied  Will you ye criticks give up Rome and Greece  And turn Mahometans and save this piece  What shall our stage receive this Tartar race  Each whisker'd hero with a copper face  I hate the Tartars hate their vile reli ion  We have no souls forsooththat's their decision  These brutes some horrid prejudice controuls  Speak English husbands have your wives no souls  Then for our personsstill more shameful work  A hundred women wed a single Turk  Again ye English husbands what say you  A hundred wives you would not wish for  two  Romans and Greeks for meO that dear Sparta  Their women had a noble Magna Charta  There a young hero had he won fair fame  Might from her husband ask a lovely dame  The happy husband of the honour vain  Gave her with joy took her with joy again  The chosen dame no struggles had within  For to refuse had been a public sin  And to their honour all historians say  No Spartan lady ever sinn'd that way  Ye fair who have not yet thrown out your bait  To tangle captives in the marriage state  Take heed I warn you where your snares you set  O let not Infidels come near your net  Let hand in hand with prudence go your wishes  Men are in general the strangest fishes  Do not for misery your beauty barter  And O take heedyou do not catch a Tartar  LXVI PROLOGUE to the SCHOOL for RAKES  A Comedy by Mrs Griffiths acted at Drurylane February This Prologue originally was different It only was altered by Mr Garrick    Spoken by Mr KING  THE scribbling gentry ever frank and free  To sweep the stage with Prologues fix on  me  A  female  representative I come  And with a Prologue which I call a broom  To sweep the critic cobwebs from the room  Criticks like spiders into corners creep  And at new plays their bloody revels keep  With some small venom close in ambush lie  Ready to seize the poor dramatick  fly  The weak and heedless soon become their prey  But the strong  blue bottle  will force its way  Clean well its wings and hum another day  Unknown to Nature's laws we've here one evil  For  flies  turn'd  spiders  play the very devil  ' Fearing some danger I will lay before ye  'A short true recent tragicomic story  ' As late I saunter'd in the Park for air  ' As free from thought as any coxcomb there  ' Two sparks came up one whisper'd in my ear  ' He was a Critic then ask'd me with a sneer  ' Thus stradling staring with a swaggering swing  '  You've writ a Farce  Yes sira foolish thing  '  Damn'd foolishbetter mind your acting King  '  'Tis ten to oneI speak it for your sake  '  That this same Farce  will  prove  YOUR WIT'S LAST STAKE  Wit's last Stake  a Farce by Mr King was acted at Drurylane April    ' I scribble for amusement boast no pow'rs  '  Right for your own amusementnot for ours  ' Thus he went on and with his pleasant talking  ' I lost the appetite I got with walking  ' He laugh'dI bow'dbut ere I could retreat  ' His lisping friend did thus the dose repeat  ' Pray sir  this School for Rakesthe woman's play  '  When do you give it us  next Saturday  ' I hope you'll both be kind to  her  at least  '  A scribbling woman is a dreadful beast  '  Then they're so ugly all these Female Wits  '  I'll damn her Playto throw her into fits  '  Had I my Willthese slattern sluttish Dames  '  They all should see the bottom of the Thames  ' If you are here  Looking about the House  good Sirs to breed a riot  ' Don't shew your spitefor if you are not quiet  ' 'Tis ten to oneI speak it for your sake  ' This  School for Rakes  we'll prove  your Wits last Stake  ' As  The Pit  you sav'd me from their tyrannic will  ' You will not let them use a Woman ill  ' Protect her and her BratThe truly Brave  ' Women and Children will for ever save  LXVII EPILOGUE to the FATAL DISCOVERY  A Tragedy by Mr Home acted at Drurylane Feb    Spoken by Mrs ABINGTON    Enters in a Hurry    FORGIVE my coming thus our griefs to utter  I'm such a figureand in such a flutter  So circumstanc'd in such an aukward way  I know not what to do or what to say  Our bard a strange unfashionable creature  As obstinate as savage in his nature  Will have no EpilogueI told the brute  If Sir these trifles don't  your  genius suit  We have a working Prologuesmith within  Will strike one off as if it were a pin  Nay Epilogues  are  pinswhose points wellplac'd  Will trick your Muse out in the tiptoo taste  " Pins madam frown'd the bard the Greeks us'd none  " Then mutt'ring Greeksomething like this went on  "  Pinnos painton patcheros non Graeco Modon  "  I coax'd he swore"That tie him to a stake  " He'd suffer all for Decency's fair sake  " No Bribery should make him change his plan"  There's an odd mortal Match him if you can  Hah sir said Iyour reasoning is not deep  For when at Tragedies spectators weep  Like harmless infants mourn themselves asleep  They oft like children cry themselves asleep  And if no jogging Epilogue you write  Pit Box and Gallery may sleep all night  " Better he sworea nap should overtake ye  " Than Folly should to Folly's pranks awake ye  " Rakes are more harmless nodding upon benches  " Than ogling to ensnare poor simple wenches  " And simple girls had better close their eyes  " Than send them gadding after butterflies  " Nay should a statesman make a box his nest  " Who that his country loves would break his rest  " Let come what may I will not make 'em laugh  " Take for an  Epilogue  This  Epitaph  'Tis thus these pedant Greekread poets vapour  Is it your pleasure I should read the paper  Here in the arms of death a matchless pair  A young lov'd hero and beloved fair  Now find reposeTheir Virtues tempesttost  Seasick and weary reach the wish'dfor coast  Whatever mortal to this spot is brought  O may the living by the dead be taught  May here Ambition learn to clip her wing  And Jealousy to blunt her deadly sting  Then shall the Poet every wish obtain  Nor Ronan nor Rivine die in vain  LXVIII PROLOGUE to Dr LAST in his CHARIOT  A Comedy by Mr Bickerstaff acted at the Haymarket June    Spoken by Mr FOOTE  YOUR servants kind masters from bottom to top  Be assur'd while I breathe or can standI mean hop  Be you pleased to smile or be pleased to grumble  Be whatever you please I am still your most humble  As to laugh is a right only given to man  To keep up that right is my pride and my plan  Fair ladies don't frown I meant woman too  What's common to man must be common to you  You all have a right your sweet muscles to curl  From the old smirking prude to the titt'ring young girl  And ever with pleasure my brains I could spin  To make you all giggle and you ye gods grin  In this present summer as well as the past  To your favour again we present Dr Last  Who by wonderful feats in the papers recounted  From trudging on foot to his chariot is mounted  Amongst the old Britons when war was begun  Charioteers would slay ten while the foot could slay one  So when doctors on wheels with dispatches are sent  Mortality bills rise a thousand per cent  But think not to physic that quack'ry's confin'd  All the world is a stage and the quacks are mankind  There's trade law and statequacks nay would we but search  We should findheaven bless ussome quacks in the church  The stiff band and stiff bob of the methodist race  Give the balsam of life and the tincture of grace  And their poor wretched patients think much good is done 'em  Tho' blisters and caustics are ever upon them  As for law and the state if quack'ry's a curse  Which will make the good bad and the bad will make worse  We should point out the quack from the regular brother  They are wiser than I who can tell one from t'other  Can the stage with its bills puffs and patients stand trial  Shall we find out no quacks in the TheatreRoyal  Some dramatical drugs that are puff'd on the town  Cause many wry faces and scarce will  go down  Nay an audience sometimes will in quack'ry delight  And sweat down an Author sometimes in one night  To return to our quackshould he help'd by the weather  Raise laughter and kind perspiration together  Should his nostrums of hips and of vapours but cure ye  His chariot he well will deserve I assure ye  'Tis easy to set up a chariot in town  And easier still is that chariot laid down  He petitions by me both as doctor and lover  That you'll not stop his wheels or his chariot tip over  Fix him well I beseech you the worst on't would be  Should you overturn  him  you may  overset me  LXIX EPILOGUE  Spoken before the Earl of CHESTERFIELD and a private Party at Dr Dodd's after the Performance by two young Gentlemen of some Scenes from Shakespeare Moliere Zenobia and the Mayor of Garratt  WHATE'ER you think good sirs in this agree  That we at least have giv'n  variety  That we have posted on in prose and verse  Thro' Tragedyand Comedyand Farce  Have you not had in me a strange farrago  Of Rhadamistus Stargeon and Iago  Nay we have run from English to the French  And the great boy became a simple wench  Nature a simple wench much better teaches  To act our characters and wear the breeches  But why this motley mixture 'Tis the fashion  The times are medleymedley all the nation  One day reigns Tragedy all gloom and sorrow  Then shift the scenes and enter Farce tomorrow  Now rise six thousand discontented sailors  Then comes the Farceget up as many taylors  These  kings of shreds and patches  touch'd in brain  Strut for a day and thencrosslegg'd again  Our goddess Liberty from whom we own  Each blessing springsfor GEORGE is on the throne  Now Magna Charta and a William gives  Then scours the streets and with the rabble lives  Will drink huzza and rouze you from your beds  Break all your windows and perhaps your heads  Here taste opinions passions never fix  But rise and fall like stocksand politicks  That we should  ask  you to our medley

pawn her jewelsthere's a precious plan  To extricate from want a brave  old  man  And fall in love with poverty and honour  A girl of fortune fashionFie upon her  But do not think we females of the stage  So dead to the refinements of the age  That we agree with our old fashion'd poet  I am point blank against him and I'll shew it  And that my tongue may more politely run  Make me a ladyLady Blabington  Now with a rank and title to be free  I'll make a catechismand you shall see  What is the  veritable Beaume de Vie  As I change place I stand for that or this  My Lady questions firstthen answers Miss  She speaks as my Lady  " Come tell me child what were our modes and dress  " In those strange times of that old fright Queen Bess"  And now for Miss  She changes place and speaks for Miss  When Bess was England's queen  Ladies were dismal beings seldom seen  They rose betimes and breakfasted as soon  On beef and beer then studied Greek till noon  Unpainted cheeks with blush of health did glow  Beruff'd and fardingal'd from top to toe  Nor necks nor ancles would they ever shew  Learnt Greek  laughs  Our outside head takes half a day  Have we much time to dress the  inside  pray  No heads dress'd  à la Greque  the ancients quote  There may be learning in a  papillote  Cards are  our  classicks and I Lady B  In learning will not yield to any she  Of the late founded  female  university    But now for Lady Blab  Speaks as my Lady  " Tell me Miss Nancy  " What sports and what employments did they fancy"  Speaks as Miss  The vulgar creatures seldom left their houses  But taught their children work'd and lov'd their spouses  The use of cards at Christmas only knew  They play'd for little and their games were few  Oneand thirty Put All fours and Lantera Loo  They bore a race of mortals stout and boney  And never heard the name of Macaroni  Speaks as my Lady  " Oh brava brava that's my pretty dear  " Now let a modern modish fair appear  " No more of these old dowdy maids and wives  " Tell how superior beings pass their lives"  Speaks as Miss  Till noon they sleep from noon till night they dress  From night till morn they game it more or less  Next night the same sweet course of joy run o'er  Then the night after as the night before  And the night after that encore encore  She comes forward  Thus with our cards we  shuffle  off all sorrow  " Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow"  We  deal apace  from youth unto our prime  To the last moment of our  tabby  time  And all our yesterdays from rout and drum  Have lighted fools with empty pockets home  Thus do our lives with rapture roll away  Not with the nonsense of our author's play  This is true lifetrue spiritgive it praise  Don't snarl and sigh for good Queen Bess's days  For all you look so

spirits and astrology  'Twas by the stars they prosper'd or miscarried  Thro' them grew rich or poor were hang'd or married  And if their wives were naught then they were born  Under the Ram or Bull or Capricorn  How many of the signs are tip'd with horn  When our greatgrandmamas had made a slip  Their shoes with higher heels w uld often trip  The rose and lily left their cheeks'twas duty  To curse their planets and destroy their beauty  Such ign'rance with faith in stars prevails  Our faces never change they tell no tales  Or should a husband rather unpolite  Lock up our persons and our roses blight  When once set free again there's nothing in it  We can be ros'd and lily'd in a minute  Fly all abroad be taken into favour  And be as fresh and frolicksome as ever  To heav'nly bodies we have no relation  The star that rules us is our inclination  Govern'd by that our earthly bodies move  Quite unconnected with the things above  Two young ones lovea chaise to Scotland carries 'em  The stars lend light and inclination marries 'em  When passion cools and flame is turn'd to smother  They curse no starsbut Scotland and each other  To walk when dark no belles now make a fuss  No spectres or hobgoblins frighten us  No says Old Crab of Fops the last editions  Pray madam what are they but apparitions  So slim so pale so dress'd from foot to head  Half girl half boy half living and half dead  They are not flesh and blood but walking gingerbread  Mere flimsy beings kept alive by art  " They come like shadows and they so depart"  O fye for shame said Ihe turn'd about  And turn'd  us  topsyturvey inside out  Rail'd at our sex then curs'd the stars and swore  But you're alarm'd I see I'll say no more  Old doating fools from stars derive all evil  Nor search our hearts to find the little devil  Ladies take council crush the mischief there  Lay but that  spirit  you'll be wiseas fair  LXXXII PROLOGUE To A CHRISTMAS TALE  A Dramatick Performance by Mr Garrick acted at

But both are sometimes blind and sometimes lame  Can those cry stand while they themselves are reeling  Can those catch thieves while they themselves are stealing  When wanted most the watch a nap will take  Are all our comic authors quite awake  Or what is worse by which they still come near 'em  Are not you more than half asleep who hear 'em  I your old watchman here have fix'd my stand  On many a vice and folly laid my hand  'Twas you cry'd Watch I limp'd at your command  Let me like other Watchmen bless the times  And take the privilege to nod betimes  Nor let your srowns now force me on a fright  To cry past sev'n o'clockand a CLOUDY night  But with your patience not to be too free  We'll change the subject and the simile  To chace a smuggling crew who law deride  We launch a cutter of three guns this tide  With your assistance we will make the foe  Sink or submitto CAPTAIN TIMBERTOE  Ye pirate critics fall not foul of me  If once I sink I founder in the sea  In this condition can I swim to shore  I'm cork 'tis true  pointing to his artificial leg  but then I want an oar  Besides 'tis dangerous I find to steep  Myself and ship in brine twelve fathom deep  My chin I'd rather above water keep  You oft' have sav'd my little bark from sinking  I am no fishfave me from  water drinking  LXXXV OCCASIONAL PROLOGUE  Upon Mr LACY's first Appearance in the Character of Alexander  Spoken by Mr KING October at Drurylane Theatre  IN Macedon when Alexander reign'd  And vict'ry after victory was gain'd  The Greek Gazettes for they had papers there  Publish'd a thousand fibsas they do here  From them one  Curtius  wrote of Philip's son  How he did things which never could be done  Unlike his copy who will soon appear  His mighty soul ne'er knew the smallest fear  Tho' laurel crown'd our pale young monarch comes  Trembling amidst his triumphs shouts and drums  Would give up all his vict'ries false or true  To gain one greater conquestthat of  you  "  Lord  cries a buxom widow loud and strong  He's quite a boyto play that part is wrong  "  " Madam he's six feet high and cannot be too young"  "  He looks so modest hardly speaks a word  Can he with proper spirit draw his sword  A face so smooth where neither rage or pride is  Fits not the hero  "  Fronti nulla fides  In English thus trust not to looks they'll cheat us  Bounc'd  ot Sir Swagger lately as he'd beat us  And was not he with all his frowns and airs  By one who seem'd all meekness kick'd down stairs  Miss B all delicacy nerve and fear  Elop'd last week with a horsegrenadier  And our advent'rer tho' so mild and civil  If you once rouze him plays the very devil  "  Indeed  cries madam  Sir I'm much your debtor  I should be glad to know the young man better  "  Twice our young hero who for glory tow'rs  In fields less dang'rous try'd his unknown pow'rs  Mr Lacy performed twice at Birmingham the preceding September    Like a young swimmer whom his fears command  In shallow streams first ventur'd from the land  'Till bolder grown the rougher wave he stems  P  anges from giddy heights into the Thames  E'en now he starts to hear the torrent roar  While his pale fates stand

Gazetteers  My soaring wings are fine election speeches  And puffs of candidates supply my breeches  No flowing robe and trumpet me adorn  I wear a jacket and I wind a horn  My cap is satyr criticism

forth to gaping crouds  Now Highgate glitters from her hill of clouds  St George's fields with taste and fashion struck  Display Arcadia at the Dog and Duck  And Drury misses here in carmine pride  Are there Pastorasby the fountain side  To flow'ry bow'rs they reel thro' midnight damps  With fawns half drunk and dryads breaking lamps  Both far and near did this new whimsy run  One night forsooth it frisk'd at Islington  And now as for the publick bound to cater  Our Manager must have his Fete Champetie  How is the weatherPretty clear and bright  A storm's the devil on Champetre night  Lest it

writtenMAID o' th' OAKS  The actors crouded round the girls caress'd it  " Lord the sweet pretty babe" they prais'd and bless'd it  The master peep'd smil'd took it in and dress'd it  Whate'er's its

and the next Season two other Epilogues were spoken by Mrs Abington The second by the Author of the Play and the third by an unknown hand This last was generally at the time ascribed to Mr Garrick It is not however here inserted as authentic information has been given that it was not written by him This is mentioned that the present collection may not be censured for an omission    IN Parliament whene'er a question comes  Which makes the Chief look grave and bite his thumbs  A knowing one is sentfly as a mouse  To peep into the humour of the House  I am that mouse peeping at friends and foes  To find which carry it the Ayes or Noes  With more than power of Parliament you sit  Despotic representatives of wit  For in a moment and without much pother  You can dissolve this piece and call another  As 'tis no treason let us frankly see  In what they differ and in what agree  The said supreme assembly of the nation  With this our great dramatic Convocation  Business in both oft meets with interruption  In both we trust no brib'ry or corruption  Both proud of freedom have a turn to riot  And the best Speaker cannot keep you quiet  Nay there as here he knows not how to steer him  When "order order's" drown'd in "hear him hear him"  We have unlike to them one constant rule  We open doors and chuse our Galleries full  For a full house both send abroad their fummons  With us together sit the Lords and Commons  You ladies here have votes debate dispute  There if you goOh fye for shameyou're mute  Never was heard of such a persecution  'Tis the great blemish of the Constitution  No human laws should nature's rights abridge  Freedom of speech our dearest privilege  Ours is the wiser sex though deem'd the weaker  I'll put the questionif you choose me Speaker  Suppose me now bewigg'd and seated here  I call to orderYou the Chair the Chair  Is it your pleasure that this Bill shou'd pass  Which grants this poet upon Mount Parnass  A certain spot where never

st December on the first appearance of Miss COLE in The COUNTRY GIRL  Spoken by Mr KING  HER age five months four days and seventeen years  The Country Girl  this awful night appears  A chicken in the shell snatch'd from the hen  And hopes to find some kindness among men  Tho' in the shell by some device or other  We hope to rear her and without her mother  A French Philosopher found out the art  To make an Oven act dame nature's part  With ventilator shut and full each seat  Could we not give this house an oven's heat  Ye critick epicures encrease our stores  Come but each night and crowd us to the doors  We'll hatch you chicken actresses by scores  Should our poor Country Girl so young and weak  Come trembling forth unable yet to speak  Your soft'ring smiles her drooping heart wou'd reach  And so restore her to full powers of speech  Our  Manager  might soon the change deplore  And if she wed her  husband  still much more  But jest apartgive but her bosom peace  And with her fears her terrors wou'd decrease  When first the linnet by the fowler caught  From native woods and fields to town is brought  Unus'd to crowds its bosom nimbly heaves  In broken thrills the little songster grieves  Till bolder grown the warbler swells its throat  And fills the house with each harmonious note  Indulgent care the weakest soon makes strong  And gratitude breaks forth in ceaseless song  LXXXIX EPILOGUE to The CHOLERIC MAN  A Comedy by Mr Cumberland acted at Drury lane December    Spoken by Mrs ABINGTON  AS I'm an Artist can my skill do better  Than paint your pictures For I'm

doze  Nor shake the dewdrops from the weeping rose  Prudes of each sex affirm and who denies  That in each tear a whimp'ring Cupid lies  To such wise formal folk my answer's simple  A thousand Cupids revel in a dimple  From their soft nests with laughter out they rush  Perch'd on your heads like small birds in a bush  Beauty resistless in each smile appears  Are you for dimples ladies or for tears  Dare they with Comedy our mirth abridge  Let us stand up for gigg'ling privilege  Assert our rights that laughter is no sin  From the  screw'd simper  to the  broadfac'd  grin  So much for selfnow turn we to our Poet  "  Know your own Mind  "Are any here who know it  To know one's mind is a hard task indeed  And harder still for us by all agreed  Cards balls beaus feathersround the eddy

and he fears his wife  He'll quit this house not knowing what to do  The  Shakespear  's  head  first gives a pull or two  But with a sideling struggle he gets thro'  Darts across Russellstreet then

appeared on the Stage after the Death of her Husband and before the Tragedy of DOUGLAS  Mr Barry died th January    WITH every hope a  vessel  sails away  Soft swells the breeze and cloudless breaks the day  Till rising winds the raging deeps deform  And the bark shatter'd sinks beneath the storm  Such is my fatefair gales my canvas spread  Till the charg'd tempest burst upon my head  Of the lov'd pilot of my life bereft  Save your protection not a hope is left  Without that peace your kindness can impart  Nothing can calm this sorrowbeaten heart  When bounty on the feeling mind first flow'd  Then sprung the bosom's fairest flower and blow'd  Angels with rapture the blest produce view'd  For from  benevolence  rose  gratitude  Urg'd by my duty I have ventur'd here  But how for  Douglas  can I shed a tear  When  real  griefs the burden'd bosom press  Can it raise sighs  feign'd  sorrows to express  In vain will Art from Nature help implore  When Nature for her self exhausts her store  The tree cut down to which she clung and grew  Behold the propless Woodbine bends to you  Your fost'ring pow'r will spread protection round  And tho' she droops may raise her from the ground  XCIX PROLOGUE To ALL THE WORLD's A STAGE  A Farce by Mr Jackman acted at Drurylane April  Spoken by Mr KING  PRAY let me see if what France says be true  That smiling faces in this land are few  I'll tell you how they mark you to a tittle  They say you think too much and talk too little  While you with scorh cry out against their prate  And swear with heels so light their heads want weight  Be but some clouds of politics blown o'er  England would shew its laughing face once more  For this good end our bard throws in his mite  And hopes to steal you from your cares to night  Now for our title  All the World's a stage  The lively French of every rank and age  In acting scenes employ their laughing hours  And life's rough path make gay by strewing flowers  Let but the fashion spread throughout our isle  And what makes Frenchmen grin will make you smile  The drama would like Alkalis protect you  From those four humours which so much affect you  Sweeten your blood with its swift current mix  And cure the crudities of polities  Our farce exhibits such a scene as thie  And low are our  personae dramatis  The various servants at a country feet  As  actors  furnish out the curious treat  In  Alexander  will the  Butler  rave  And nought can  Clytus  the fat  coachman  save  From Philip's sonYou'll see the hero soon  Dealing death round him with a silver spoon  The  Cock Roxana  glowing with desire  Burns as she bastesher bosom all on fire  The groom and footmen act their parts so well  No longer Tom and Dick they hear no bell  The butler madall's in consusion hurl'd  He  can't  obey  for he  commands  the  world  His victories alone possess his brain  So master bawls and mistress scolds in vain  Criticsindulge these heroes in their fancies  Nor by your frowns restore 'em to their senses  C  The VAUDEVILLE introduced in the PRELUDE called Bundle of PROLOGUES and sung by Mr BANNISTER and others  April    MY brothers and sisters of buskin and sock  We now are not actors to feign and to mock  We give you passions  No humours and fashions  Save only our own native stock  For the bounty with which you o'erflow  Makes the sweet plant of gratitude grow  In our bosoms our merry hearts leap  We now are no play'rs  But send up our pray'rs  That the blessings you sow you may reap  My sisters and brothers who ost trod the stage  Who now are declining with sickness and age  You now see before ye  The charms that restore ye  To the audience  Whose bounty your griefs will assuage  Tender beauty is fairest to view  As a rose is when sprinkled with dew  The king and the cobler by turns was my lot  I mended old soals and wore crowns on this spot  Whatever my station  Or high occupation  My duty I never forgot  When a tyrant with death in my stride  My dependance on you was my pride  I beg your old servant may throw in his mite  Who loves and would sarve you by day and by night  For you my dear creatures  And you with sweet features    To the Ladies  I'm ready to sing or to fight  As by you all distress I defy  So for you while I live will I die  In the change of each year as this day will come round  Our duty we'll pay as in duty we're bound  Our old hearts with pleasure  Their thanks without measure  From earth to the sky will resound  In our faces your bounty is seen  Smiles of age speak the comfort within  In our bosoms our merry hearts

August    Spoken by Mr FARREN  WHAT various modes prevail in various parts  And to indulge our passions what strange arts  To cheat the  old  the  young  exert their skill  And often cheat themselves to have their will  In  Spain  to lock up girls it is their plan  To pick the locks the  Barber  is the man  He foe profest to age friend to young bloods  Oft leaves the blinded  Argus  in the suds  And while warm youth with trembling beauty flies  With news and lather fills his ears and eyes  The old one chuckles thinks all safe within  Nor feels his forehead grow while reap'd his chin  In  France  there needs no subtle gobetween  Husbands and wives are ne'er together seen  Or should by chance those easy couples meet  In bails plays operas gardens or the street  No frowns exchang'd each freedom gives and grants  Monsieur his madams madam her gallants  In  Italy  the climate is so warm  Cupids like gnats throughout the country swarm  And sting both old and youngbut in that nation  No

our taste improves  Now easy sit and fit us like French gloves  But to be graveif four old age with care  Will lock up with their gold the captive fair  We hope the sons of freedom not so few  Nor so bedevil'd be  maccaronied  too  But some oldfashion'd folks will land their aid  And with their country free each captive maid  For what is gold or beauty in a nation  Unless you give it a free circulation  Should it be said alas with truth that some  Among the fair ramble too far from home  In giddy whirls forget their sex and state  Then let each  gadder  feel a diff'rent fate  Let there no female  rakes  in Britain be  Nor female  slaves  but let us all agree  That those too loose be fast and those too fast be free  CIII PROLOGUE to PERCY  A Tragedy by Miss Moore acted at

Spoken by Mr LEE LEWES  I MUST will speakI hope my dress and air  Announce the  man of fashion  not the  player  Tho' gentlemen are now forbid the scenes  Yet have I rush'd thro' heroes kings and queens  Resolv'd in pity to this polish'd age  To drive these ballad heroes from the Stage  " To drive the deer with hounds and horn  " Earl Percy took his way  " The child may rue that is unborn  " The hunting of that day"  A pretty basis truly for a modern Play  What shall a scribbling senseless woman dare  To your refinements offer such coarse fare  Is  Douglas  or is  Percy  fir'd with passion  Ready for  love  or  glory  death to dash on  Fit company for modern stilllife  men of fashion  Such madness will our hearts but slightly graze  We've no such frantic  nobles  nowadays  Heart strings like fiddle strings vibrate no tone  Unless they're tun'd in petfect unison  And youths of yore with ours can ne'er agree  They're in too  sharp  ours in too flat a key  Could we believe old stories these strange follows  Married for  love  could of their wives be jealous  Nay constant to 'em tooand what is worse  The vulgar souls thought cuckoldom a curse  Most wedded pairs had then one purse one mind  One bed tooso preposterously join'd  From such barbarity thank heaven  we're  much resin'd  Old songs their happiness  at home  record  From home  they sep'rate carriages abhorr'd  One horse serv'd both  my lady  rode behind my lord  'Twas death alone could snap their bonds asunder  Now tack'd so slightly  not to snap  's the wonder  Nay death itself could not their hearts divide  They mix'd their love with monumental pride  For cut in stone they still lie  side by side  But why these  Gothic  ancestors produce  Why scour their rusty armours what's the use  'Twould not your nicer optics much regale  To see us beaux bend under coats of mail  Should we our limbs with iron doublets bruise  Good heav'n how much courtplaister we should use  We wear no armour nowbut on our

 Spoken by Mrs ABINGTON at the TheatreRoyal in Dablin Saturday July  This Epilogue is conjecturally ascribed to Mr Garrick    LORD how I tremble every atom shaking  What speak an Epilogue of my own making  A task for mepresumptuous and absurd  But I have promis'd and must keep my word  Yes I did promise with a solemn face  T' address my Patrons here and sue for grace  For your past favours had so warm'd my heart  I thought to tell them needed little art  How vain the thought for pondering day and night  I found tho' I could speak I could not write  Distress'd to Garrick then I fly for aid  ' You can assist me Sir for wit's your trade  When of your Epilogues I speak a line  Each sidebox cries 'Oh charming vastly fine  It's quite delightful monstrously divine'  The pit alive to every comic stroke  With laughter loud anticipate the joke  All but the modern fop to feeling dead  With heart of adamant and brains of lead  Languid and lifeless lolling yawns takes snuff  And cries 'As God's my judge it's flimsey staff  Heav'n knows I monstrously abhor a play  It's a vile borewhat brought me here today  Dear Lady Mary how can you attend  Will Garrick's nonsense never have an end'  Not so Sir Mac who just has cross'd the Tweed  Cries 'vary weel ridiculous indeed  The chield has parts Oh he'd been muckle keen  If bred at Glasgow or at Aberdeen'  Sir Paddy cries 'my jewel that's mighty pretty  Faith Garrick you were once in Dublin city  In sweet Smockalley you have cut a figure  Oh you'd be great were you a little bigger  Thus nations parties all in this agree  And humour's palm oh Garrick yield to thee  Then good Sir scribble something  To Garrick thus in flattering strains I sue  But all in vain nor prayers nor flattery do  Since thus obdurate all their aid refuse  I a mere novice must invoke the muse  Oh would immortal Shakespeare's muse of fire  Heave in this breast each kindling thought inspire  Or could I mount on the Maeonian wing  Or chaunt such songs as raptur'd Seraphs sing  To you my kind protector would I raise  My fullest loudest warmest notes of praise  The great the brave the fair who now appear  In bright array to grace this circle here  My muse to latest ages should proclaim  Their worth record and consecrate their fame  While gratitude on rapt'rous pinions soars  And echoes loud the virtues she adores  CVI EPILOGUE to ALFRED  A Tragedy by Mr Home acted at Covent Garden January    Spoken by Mrs BARRY  OUR bards of late so tragic in their calling  Have scarce preserv'd one heroine from falling  Whether the dame be widow maid or wife  She seldom from their hands escapes with life  If this green cloth could speak would it not tell  Upon its well worn nap how oft I fell  To death in various forms deliver'd up  Steel kills me one night and the next the cup  The tragic process is as short as certain  With  She makes the motion of stabbing  thisor  And here of drinking poison  this I dropthen drops the curtain  No  Saint  can lead a better life than I  For half is spent  in learning how to aie  The learn'd dispute how tragedies should end  O happily say somesome death defend  Mild criticks with good fortune to the good  While others hotbrain'd roar for blood blood blood  The fair tho' nervous tragic to the soul  Delights in daggers and the poison'd bowl  ' I would not give a blackpin for a play  ' Unless in tenderness I melt away  ' From pangs and death no lovers would I save  ' They should be wretched and despair and rave  " And ne'er together liebut in the grave'  The brave rough soldier a soft heart discovers  He swears and weeps at once when dead the lovers  As down his cheeks runs trickling nature's tide  " Damn itI wish those young ones had not dy'd"  Tho' from his eyes the drop of pity falls  He fights like Caesar when his country calls  In spite of critic laws our bard takes part  And joins in concert with the soldier's heart  O let your feelings with this party side  For once forgive me that I have not dy'd  Too hard that fate which kills a  virgin bride  CVII EPILOGUE to THE SUICIDE  A Comedy by Mr Colman acted at the Haymarket May July    Spoken by Miss FARREN  THE Critics say and constantly repeat  That woman acting man's a silly cheat  That ev'n upon the stage it should not pass  To which I saya Critic is an ass  As man true man we could not well deceive  But we like modish things may make believe  Would it be thought I give myself great airs  To put my manhood on a foot with theirs  Speak you that are men is my pride too great  To think you'd rather have with mea teteatete  In this our Play what dangers have I run  What hairbreath 'scapes and yet the prize have won  Is it a prize He may prove cross or jealous  In marriage lotteries the knowing tell us  Among our modern youths much danger lies  There are a hundred blanks for one poor prize  Was I not bold ye fair to undertake  To tame that wildest animala rake  To lead a tyger in a silken string  Hush the loud storm and clip the whirlwind's wing  My pride was piqued all dangers I would through  To have her way what would not woman do  The papers swarm each day with patent puffers  For smoaky chimneyspowdersmousetrapssnuffers  And I could fame as well as fortune raise  To cure by patent  La Folie Angloise  I'm sure you all my nostrum will approve  By nature's guidance let your passions move  Drive out that Demon gaming by the angel love  But ladies if you wish to know my plan  By stratagem not force attack your man  By open war the danger is increas'd  Use gentle means to soothe the savage beast  If when his blood boils o'er your's bubbles too  Then all is lost and there's the devil to do  Piff puff blown up at once the lover's part  He snaps his chainand madambreaks her heart  Hymen puts out his torch and Cupid blunts his dart  Thus ends the Farce or Tragedy of Love  But ladies if your sparks are given to rove  From my experience take one general rule  Cool as he warms and love will never cool  If smoak prevails and the choak'd flame is dying  Then gently fan it with some little sighing  Then drop into the flame a tear or two  And blazing up like oil 'twill burn him thro'  Then add kind looks soft words sweet smilesno pout  And take my word the slame will ne'er go out  These with good humour mix'd the balm of life  Will be the best receipt for maid or wife  CVIII PROLOGUE to BONDUCA  A TragiComedy by Beaumont and Fletcher altered by Mr Colman and acted at the Haymarket July    Spoken by Mr PALMER  TO  modern  Britons let the old appear  This night to rouse 'em for this anxious year  To raise that spirit which of yore when rais'd  Made even Romans tremble while they prais'd  To rouse that spirit which thro' every age  Has wak'd the lyre and warm'd th' historian's page  That dauntless spirit which on Cressy's plain  Rush'd from the heart thro' ev'ry British vein  Nerv'd ev'ry arm the numerous host to dare  Whilst Edward's valor shone the guiding star  Whose beams dispers'd the darkness of despair  Whate'er the craft or number of the foes  Ever from danger Britain's glory rose  To the mind's eye let the  fifth Harry  rise  And in that vision boasting France despise  Then turn to later deeds your sires have wrought  When Anna rul'd and mighty Marlb'rough fought  Shall Chatham die and be forgot  Lord Chatham died May  O no  Warm from its source let grateful sorrow slow  His matchless ardor  r'd each fearstruck mind  His genius soar'd when Britons droop'd and pin'd  Whilst each State Atlas sunk beneath the load  His heart unshook with patriot virtue glow'd  Like Hercules he freed 'em from the weight  And on  his  shoulders fix'd the tottering state  His strength the monsters of the land defy'd  To raise his country's glory was his pride  And for her service as he liv'd he dy'd  O for his powers those feelings to impart  Which rous'd to action every drooping heart  Now while the angry trumpet sounds alarms  And all the nation cries "to arms to arms"  Then would his native strength each Briton know  And scorn the threats of an invading foe  Hatching and seeding every civil broil  France looks with envy on our happy soil  When mischief's on the wing she cries for war  Insults distress and braves her conqueror  But Shakespeare sungand well this land he knew  O hear his voice that nought shall make us rue  " If England to itself do rest but true"  CIX PROLOGUE to the FATHERS  A Comedy by Henry Fielding acted at Drury lane November    Spoken by Mr KING  WHEN from the world departs a son of fame  His deeds or works

friend of Doctor Johnson except the third Stanza which was added by Mr Garrick himself  COME my lads with souls befitting  Let us never be dismay'd  Let's avenge the wrongs of  Britain  And support her injur'd trade  The true spirit of the nation  In our honest hearts we bring  True tho' in an humble station  To our country and our king  Spain  no longer shall assume boys  The free ocean as her own  For the time at last is come boys  We'll their topsails lower down  Tho' in politicks contesting  Round and round they veer about  All their ships and  manifesting  With our broadsides we will rout  Hark the roaring cannons thunder  See my lads six ships appear  Ev'ry  Briton  acting wonders  Strikes the southern world with fear  Porto Bello  fam'd in story  Now at last submits to fate  VERNON's courage gains us glory  And his mercy proves us great  On our naval strength depending  Let us steer  Old England's  course  When affronted vengeance sending  Shew the world  Old England's  force  Then loud peals of  British  thunder  Rattling on each hostile shore  Shall make haughty Dons knock under  Nor shall dare insult us more  May all  English  Tars like you boys  Prove on shore true  hearts of gold  To their king and country true boys  And be neither bought nor sold  Let the landmen without party  Act like brethren of the flood  To one cause alone be hearty  And be that their country's good  Then thro' all the mighty ocean  Th'  English  cross shall honour find  Far as we can feel a motion  Far as flag can move with wind  Then insulting monarchs shewing  More regard shall humbler be  The old truth of  Britons  knowing  As they're  brave  they will be  free  SONG  SYLVIA  IF truth can fix thy wav'ring heart  Let Damon urge his claim  He feels the passion void of art  The pure the constant flame  Though sighing swains their torments tell  Their sensual love contemn  They only prize the beauteous shell  But slight the inward gem  Possession cures the wounded heart  Destroys the transient fire  But when the mind receives the dart  Enjoyment whets desire  By age your beauty will decay  Your mind improves with years  As when the blossoms fade away  The rip'ning fruit appears  May Heav'n and Sylvia grant my suit  And bless the future hour  That Damon who can taste the fruit  May gather ev'ry flow'r  PEGGY  This Song was written in compliment to Mrs Woffington    Once more I'll tune the vocal shell  To hills and dales my passion tell  A flame which time can never quell  That burns for thee my Peggy  Yet guittar bards the lyre shall hit  Or say what subject is more fit  Than to record the sparkling wit  And bloom of lovely Peggy  The sun first rising in the morn  That paints the dewbespangled thorn  Does not so much the day adorn  As does my lovely Peggy  And when in Thetis' lap to rest  He streaks with gold the ruddy west  She's not so beauteous as undrest  Appears my lovely Peggy  When Zephyr on the vi'let blows  Or breathes upon the damask rose  He does not half the sweets disclose  As does my lovely Peggy  I stole a kiss the other day  And trust me nought but truth I say  The fragrance of the blooming May  Is not so sweet as Peggy  Were she array'd in rustic weed  With her the bleating flocks I'd feed  And pipe upon the oaten reed  To please my lovely Peggy  With her a cottage would delight  All's happy when she's in my sight  But when she's gone it's endless night  All's dark without my Peggy  While bees from flower to flower shall rove  And linnets warble thro' the grove  Or stately swans the rivers love  So long shall I love Peggy  And when death with his pointed dart  Shall strike the blow that rives my heart  My words shall be when I depart  " Adieu my lovely Peggy"  SONG in LETHE  Sung by Mr BEARD in the Character of Mercury  Ye mortals whom fancies and troubles perplex  Whom folly misguides and infirmities vex  Whose lives hardly know what it is to be blest  Who rise without joy and lie down without

all her wants  Or drench her fond fool to forget her gallants  The troubled in mind shall go chearful away  And yesterday's wretch be quite happy today  Obey then the summons to Lethe repair  Drink

we must shear  In your holiday suits with your lasses appear  The happiest of folk are the guiltless and free  And who are so guiltless so happy as we  II  We harbour no passions by luxury taught  We practise no arts with hypocrisy fraught  What we think in our hearts you may read in our eyes  For knowing no falshood we need no disguise  III  By mode and caprice are the city dames led  But we as the children of nature are bred  By her hand alone we are painted and dress'd  For the roses will bloom when there's peace in the breast  IV  That giant ambition we never can dread  Our roofs are too low for so lofty a head  Content and sweet chearfulness open our door  They smile with the simple and feed with the poor  V  When Love has possess'd us that love we reveal  Like the flocks that we feed are the passions we feel  So harmless and simple we sport and we play  And leave to fine folks to deceive and betray  The BEERDRINKING BRITON  A SONG  Set to musick by Doctor Arne and sung by Mr

not we in our turn be as free  All the world plays the best of the game  III  The lawyers of note who squabble and quote  Are expecting both riches and fame  And all is but trick the poor client to nick  For the law plays the best of the game  IV  To gain his base ends each lover pretends  To talk of his darts and his flame  By which he draws in the poor maiden to sin  Who is left with the worst

rages there in gusts and storms  But love with us a constant gale  Just swells the sea and fills the sail  Neither of winds or waves the sport  We rule the helm and gain the port  AIR  When youthful charms  Fly pleasure's arms  Kind nature's gifts are vain  We should not save  What nature gave  But kindly give again  Tho' scorn and pride  Our wishes hide  And tho' the tongue says nay  The honest

CIBBER in  The Way to keep Him  in the Character of Widow Bellmour  YE fair married dames who so often deplore  That a lover once blest is a lover no more  Attend to my counsel nor blush to be taught  That prudence must cherish what beauty has caught  The bloom of your cheek and the glance of your eye  Your roses and lilies may make the men sigh  But roses and lilies and fighs pass away  And passion will die as your beauties decay  Use the man that you wed like your fav'rite guittar  Tho' musick in both they are both apt to jar  How tuneful and soft from a delicate touch  Not handled too roughly nor play'd on too much  The sparrow and linnet will feed from your hand  Grow tame by your kindness and come at command  Exert with your husband the same happy skill  For hearts like your birds may be tam'd to your will  Be gay and goodhumour'd complying and kind  Turn the chief of your care from your face to your mind  'Tis thus that a wife may her conquests improve  And Hymen shall

sweetest of flowers and fairest of fruit  All shall yield to the Mulberrytree c c  V  With learning and knowledge the wellletter'd birch  Supplies law and physic and grace for the church  But law and the gospel in Shakespeare we find  And he gives the best physick for body and mind  All shall yield to the Mulberrytree c c  VI  The fame of the Patron gives fame to the tree  From him and his merits this takes its degree  Let Phoebus and Bacchus their glories resign  Our tree shall surpass both the laurel and vine  All shall yield to the Mulberrytree c c  The genius of Shakespeare outshines the bright day  More rapture than wine to the heart can convey  So the tree that he planted by making his own  Has laurel and bays and the vine all in one  All shall yield to the mulberry tree c  VIII  Then each take a relick of this hallow'd tree  From folly and fashion a charm let it be  Fill fill to the planter the cup to the brim  To honour the country do honour to him  All shall yield to the

What makes me so restless by night and by day  In vain I perplex my poor fancy  To find out the grief  But alas no relief  Heigho what can be the matter with Nancy  With my head on my pillow I seek

young Oxford scholar knows well my sad case  For he look'd in my eyes and read over my face  So learned he talk'd that I felt at my heart  He must have great skill in the magical art  In vain I perplex c  O send for this scholar and let him prescribe  He'll do me more good than the medical tribe  Then the rose with the lily again shall appear  And my heart now so heavy dance thro' the whole

learnedly in my field of politics as you or any of your correspondents can do in your's I can remember the day when a Gray'sInn Journalist or a Herald has mauled a manager weekly as ably as the Monitor or the North Briton has lately attacked the Minister Some of your politicians allow Mr Pitt to be a great man but think he has been too fond of continental connections In like manner I not only allow Garrick to be the greatest actor the world ever saw but also am of opinion that he is an excellent manager and yet I must as a true patriot blame him for his encouragement of pantomime Two Pantomimes in one winter and the town had only sense enough to damn one O tempora O mores but I shall conclude what I have to say at present with taking notice that the revolutions of theatres are as extraordinary as those  of states and republics and tumults in kingdoms are scarce attended with greater confusion than riots at the Playhouse On these occasions great patriots theatrical and political chiefly shew themselves Hampden who opposed shipmoney is not more celebrated than Thady Fitzpatrick who demolished full price The following poem is a parody on that celebrated ode of Dryden's which that great orator Mr Sheridan has so often recited with uncommon applause at Springgardens Pewterershall Drurylane Theatre Oxford Cambridge and Bath and I most heartily wish that it were in my power to prevail with that gentleman to employ his noble powers of elocution on the following parody  'TWAS at the rabble rout when Mima won  Thro' Fizgig Fizgig's son  Below in aukward state  The blust'ring ruffian fate  On his audacious throne  His noisy peers were plac'd around  Their brows with malice and with rapine frown'd  So footpads in the dark are found  The blarneying Burky by his side  In impudence and ignorance ally'd  With brazen front was seen in riot's pride  Shameless shameless shameless pair  Well do your heads your hearts declare  Our Garrick's voice on high  A while the rout confounds  He runs with rapid skill thro' elocution's bounds  The lofty sounds ascend the sky  And in the sons of poetry  Celestial joys inspire  From Shakespeare's self the lore he caught  From him the glowing pow'r possest  Who gaz'd on nature's charms with eager ardour fraught  And to her pliant form with warmth resistless prest  Ecstatic warmth by which his lays  Have been deriv'd to modern days  Then while he sought her lovely breast  While round her yielding waste he curl'd  He stamp'd an image of himselfa Garrick for the world  The sons of taste admire the lofty

her lovely face  While the prevailing verse he strives to raise  And bids descriptive pow'r grow lavish in her praise  Thalia ever fair and young  Mirthsome joys did first ordain  Thalia's blessings are a treasure  Neversating stream of pleasure  Which she pours from charmed cup  O'er souls "who've ta'en their freedom up"  Rich the treasure  Sweet the pleasure  To souls "who've ta'en their freedom up"  Wex'd at the sound the General's pride wax'd low  Too weak to ward off Reason's blow  Yet thrice he drown'd fair Justice' voice yet thrice he bawl'd  YES or NO  The master saw the madness rise  His swelling cheeks his envious eyes  And while he heav'n and earth defy'd  His ready hand he chang'd and try'd to check his pride  He chose the mournful muse  Soft pity to infuse  He sung Melpomene divine  By too severe a fate  Fallen fallen fallen fallen  Fallen from her high estate  Dethron'd by Pantomime  Deserted in her utmost need  By those her sacred labours fed  On the bare stage distrest she lies  With not a friend to bid her rise  With downcast looks the joyless Gen'ral sate  Revolving in his alter'd soul  The various merits of the stage  And now and then a groan he stole  And shouts began to rage  BEARD sweet musician then essay'd  The pow'r of harmony to prove  To poetry a kindred aid  With pity melting as with love  Softly sweet in Lydian measures  He try'd to sooth his soul to pleasures  Jars he sung are toil and trouble  Faction a misleading bubble  Path to discontent and frenzy  Fighting still and still destroying  Tho' the stage be worth thy envy  Think

Each a club in his hand  Those are hireling slaves who to eating are strangers  Who obey the command  Tho' shock'd at the dangers  Give the vengeance due  To the blust'ring crew  Behold how they toss up the benches on high  O Fitzgig return and our victory spy  How they break the orchestral abodes  How the instruments shatter by loads  The ruffians applaud with a furious joy  And a buck seiz'd a candle with zeal to destroy  Burky led the way  To guide them to their prey  And like another Ganymede reduc'd another Troy  Not long ago  Ere bouncing braggarts dealt the blow  While blockheads yet were mute  Our Garrick to the feeling mind could suit  His various art each passion could inspire  Could kindle manly rage or melt with soft desire  At last enormous Fitzgig came  Inspirer of the robber's claim  The strange enthusiast impositions gives  Quenching the fire of magic sounds  Adds length and strength to mimic bounds  With impudence and pride and arts unknown to thieves  Let judgment then resign the prize  And mourn her mangled crown  She rais'd a Shakespeare to the skies  He threw a Garrick down  The plund'rers rend the roof with loud applause  So Merit lost and Riot won

  OH thou whose artless freeborn genius charms  Whose rustic zeal each patriot bosom warms  Pursue the glorious task the pleasing toil  Forsake the fields and  till  a nobler soil  Extend the  Farmer's  care to human kind  Manure  the heart and  cultivate  the mind  There  plant  religion reason freedom truth  And  sow the seeds  of virtue in our youth  Let no  rank weeds  corrupt or  brambles  cheak  And shake the  vermin  from the British oak  From  northern blasts  protect the vernal bloom  And guard our pastures from the  wolves of Rome  On Britain's  liberty  ingraft thy name  And  reap the harvest  of immortal fame  VERSES  written in a Book called  Fables for the Female Sex  by  Edward Moore  WHILE here the poet paints the charms  Which bless the perfect dame  How unaffected beauty warms  And wit preserves the flame  How prudence virtue sense agree  To form the happy wife  In LUCY and her book I see  The Picture and the Life  Verses written in  Sylvia's PRIOR

my judgment wrong  Her proofs prevail'd they reach'd my heart  And soon I felt the poet's song  Upon a  LADY'S  Embroidery  ARACHNE once as poets tell  A goddess at her art defy'd  But soon the daring

his tale  " Take my advice and mend your trade  " We both are losers if you fail  " Go write your wit in satire show  " No matter whether smart or true  " Call ** names the greatest foe  " To dullness

seat  And to shew them due honour and fame  His chambers his kitchen his cellars they prais'd  But alas they soon found to their cost  That if they expected to feast at his house  They reckon'd without their great host  He shew'd them Guy's pot but he gave them no soup  No meat would his lordship allow  Unless they had gnaw'd the bladebone of the boar  Or the rib of the famous dun cow  " But since you're my friends says this complaisant peer  " I'll give you a newprinted book  " Which may to your tastes some amusement afford  " 'Tis the hist'ry of Greville and Brooke"  Since your

Mr ANSTEY  Author of the New Bath Guide  to  DAVID GARRICK  Esq  on meeting him at a Friend's House  THRO' ev'ry part of grief or mirth  To which the mimick stage gives birth  I ne'er as yet with truth could fell  Where most your various pow'rs excel  Sometimes amidst the laughing scene  Blith comedy with jocund mien  By you in livelier colours drest  With transport clasp'd you to her breast  As oft the buskin'd muse appear'd  With awful brow her sceptre rear'd  Recounted all your laurels won  And claim'd you for her darling son  Thus each contending goddess strove  And each the fairest garland wove  But which fair nymph could justly boast  Her beauties had engag'd you most  I doubted much 'till t'other day  Kind fortune threw me in your way  Where 'midst the friendly joys that wait  Rigby  Philander's hospitable gate  Freedom and genuine mirth I found  Sporting the jovial board around  'Twas there with keen tho' polish'd jest  You sat a pleas'd and pleasing guest  With social ease a part sustain'd  More humorous far than e'er you feign'd  " Take him I cry'd bright comic maid  " In all your native charms array'd  " No longer shall my doubts appear"  When Clio whisper'd in

at the scolded and the scolders  For that to him is always best  Which raises and supports the jest  No baited bear was e'er so worry'd  I took my hat and home I hurry'd  Resolv'd as well as I was

seat  Yet there no wonders your quick eye can meet  Save should you deem it wonderful to find  Ambition cur'd and an unpassion'd mind  A statesman without pow'r and without gall  Hating no courtiers happier than them all  Bow'd to no yoke nor crouching for applause  Vot'ry alone to freedom and the laws  Herds flocks and smiling Ceres deck our plain  And interspers'd an heartenliv'ning train  Of

heav'nly fire  He tun'd the lay and swept the lyre  So Chatham whose exalted soul  Pervaded and inspir'd the whole  Where far by martial glory led  Britain her sails and banners spread  Retires tho' wisdom's God dissuades  And seeks repose in rural shades  Yet thither comes the God confess'd  Celestial form a well known guest  Nor slow he moves with solemn air  Nor on his brow hangs pensive care  Nor in his hand th' historick page  Gives lessons to experienc'd age  As when in vengeful ire he rose  And plan'd the fate of Britain's foes  While the wing'd hours obedient stand  And instant speed

FABLE  Addressed to the late  Earl  of  Chesterfield  FROM Grecian AESOP to our GAY  Each fabulist is pleased to say  That JOVE gives ear to all petitions  From animals of all conditions  Like earthly kings he hears their wants  And like them too not always grants  Some years agothe Fools assembled  Who long at STANHOPE'S wit had trembled  And with repeated strokes grown sore  Most zealously did JOVE implore  That he should shield them from that wit  Which pointed well was sure to hit  'Twas hard they said to be thus baited  They were not by themselves created  And if they were to folly prone  The fault they hop'd was not their own  JOVE smil'd and saidNot quite so fast  You were indeed made up in haste  With little care I form'd your brain  But never made you pert and vain  STANHOPE

Has driv'n the arrow o'er the mark  Deaf dumb and blind ye silly folk  Is all this rancour for a joke  Shall I be pander to your hate  And mortals teach to rail at fate  To mend a little your condition  I'll grant one third of your petition  He shall be deaf and you be free  From his keen brilliant    Which like hightemper'd polish'd steel  Will quicker wound than you can feel  With fear with weakness we comply  But still what malice  deny  How would APOLLO HERMES swear  Should I give ear to all your pray'r  And blast the man who from his birth  Has been their favourite care on earth  What tie his tongue and cloud his sight  That he no more can talk than write  I can't indulge your fe  pride  And punish all the world b  de  Answer by Lord  CHESTERFIELD  GARRICK I've read your Fools' Petition  And thank you for the composition  Tho' few will credit all you say  Yet 'tis a friendly part you play  A part which you perform with ease  Whate'er you act is sure to please  But give me leave on this occasion  To make one little observation  Though no good reason is assign'd  At least not any I can find  Why I should be deaf dumb or blind  Yet since it was resolv'd above  By this same foolobeying JOVE  I must not speak or hear or see  Surely to soften the decree  He might have left the choice to me  Were that the case I would dispense  With sight and wit and eloquence  Still to retain my fav'rite sense  For grant my friend we would admit  What some may doubt that I have wit  What are the mighty pow'rs of speech  What useful purpose do they reach  When vain and impotent you see  Ev'n down from Socrates to me  All the bonsmots that e'er were said  To mend the heart or clear the head  Fools will be fools say what we will  And rascals will be rascals still  But rather I your case would be in  Say you than lose the pow'r of seeing  The face of nature you will say  Is ever chearful ever gay  And beauty parent of delight  Must always charm the ravish'd sight  This choice perhaps I might commend  But here you have forgot my friend  That nature's face and beauty's heav'n  Lose all their charms at seventyseven  The brightest scenes repeated o'er  As well you know will please no more  The prospect's darken'd o'er with age  The drama can no more engage  We wish with you to quit the stage  In short it is a point I'm clear in  The best of senses is our hearing  Happy who keeps it still and he  Who wants must mourn the loss like me  For though I little should regret  The table's roar where fools are met  The flatt'ring tribe who sing or say  The lies

the Printer of the  Public Advertiser  SIR  Notwithstanding the great sale and reputation of Lord Chesterfield's Letters it is but lately that I had time or indeed inclination to peruse them When I was told that his Lordship as a part of polite Education forbids his son to  lough  for I am vulgar enough to seek all opportunities to shew that distinction between us and brutes I was not so eager as the rest of the world to be taught politeness at the expence of my pleasure However his letters came in my way and by reading them I have learnt what I hope soon to forget viz that laughter is a sure sign of illbreeding and that women have no Genius Very luckily a full answer to his Lordship's last assertion was recommended to me I mean a poem called  Sir Eldred of the Bower  said to be written by a  Miss Hannah More  The real pleasure I received in reading that and the  Bleeding Rock  a legendary tale by the same Author was to me so point blank against his Lordship's doctrine that I could not help shewing my gratitude to the Lady and my disapprobation of the Lord in the following lines  Upon reading Sir  ELDRED  of the  BOWER  by a  Lady  after  Lord Chesterfield's Letters  I

were shut out got in  Asserting in his wise oration  I gloried in my situation  I own my features might betray  Peculiar joy I felt that day  I glory when my mind is feasted  With dainties it has

Calls up Lord North and murders sleep  And if his Lordship rise to speak  Then wit and argument awake  When Rigby speaks and all may hear him  Who can withstand  ridendo verum  When Thurlow's words
