 THE DEAF LOVER  Price One Shilling  THE DEAF LOVER A FARCE IN TWO ACTS AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL COVENT GARDEN  WRITTEN BY F PILON  LONDON PRINTED FOR J BOWEN CORNER OF BEAUFORT BUILDINGS IN THE STRAND  M DCC LXXX  ADVERTISEMENT  THE following little piece meeting with uncommon success after having been withdrawn from the stage it may be expected that the author will say something by way of apology for the scene which in its former state was deemed exceptionable it was almost a literal translation from the Poulet a dramatic proverb and pronounced by men of unquestionable judgement an excellent situation but nothing is so difficult to decide on with certainty as the effect any incident will have in representation Much as was thought of the Poulet in the closet it was much disliked on the stage and the piece consequently withdrawn for alteration Fortunately for the author he has succeeded in his second attempt to please and the farce is once more in possession of the stage  PROLOGUE  Written by the  AUTHOR  and spoken by  Mr LEE LEWES  STATESMEN and Poets oft' one fortune find  This Court being discontent our Bard resign'd  That is to say resign'd as Courtiers mean  He was turn'd out but would come in again  On one good point he's bent a reformation  And bade me tell this grand Association  He now has made a total alteration  Mstakingly he built on Gallic ground  But prov'd French wit was like French faith unsound  Hence wiser grown he's cautious in his views  And makes no foreign compacts for his Muse  On foreign aid 'tis hazardous reliance  But certain ruin's in a French alliance  By Gar Monsieur will say you mstake quite  Mon Pais  my country be  toujours  right  Il faut vous allor  you must go to France  If you would learn to make  bon alliance  Par l'alliance Bourbon  we long trick you  Par l'alliance Amerique  trick dem too  Voila Monsieur d'Estaing  has he not play'd  One pretty trick in taking  de Grenade  Is he not grand invincible Hero  Arrah replies Teague ask General Prevost  So much with shot he bother'd him they say  He play'd an old French trick and ran away  Now home to France he's gone with broken thigh  His leg being wounded kays he came too nigh  And by St Patrick he deserv'd his fate  Who wou'd not give the women a retraat  Had but the Irish brigade been there  They'd given their hearts before they'd hurt the fair  But talk no more of Heroesname me one  Like the brave tar who met the Spanish Don  Without a sword and gave him up his own  Oh such a trick with all your gasconade  No French Monsieur or Spaniard ever play'd  But whilst for valour's crown great nations sight  And wild Ambition takes the name of Right  Ambiguous states each diff'rent power to fleece  Equal suspend the scale of war and peace  Abjure all principle but that they've lent  And know no interest but cent per cent  But rouz'd by wrongs the Genius of this land  In selfcollected might more firm shall stand  Hibernia's cause and Britain's now made one  We boast a fam'ly compact of our own  Defies the treach'rous compact of Bourbon  Whilst Justice as a flaming AEgis throws  Confusion and dismay on England's foes  Her thunder to the world shall speak again  She reigns th' unshaken Sov'reign of the Main  Dramatis Personae  Meadows  Mr LEE LEWES  Young Wrongward  Mr ROBSON  Old Wrongward  Mr WILSON  Canteen  Mr WHITFIELD  Sternhold

possibility of bribing one of the servants  CANTEEN  None in the world Sir which indeed surprized me for tho' I must confess they have all good places I have known folks with better and in a greater man's service who wou'd not let a bribe slip thro' their fingers for want of the trouble of clinching the fst upon it  MEADOWS  What shall I do Canteen you are an old campaigner and should be ripe with stratagem in desperate cases  CANTEEN  I have got a scheme to serve you if you'll undertake it  MEADOWS  Can you doubt me  CANTEEN  Then be attentive Old Wrongward's house on the approaching wedding is throng'd as a fair with company dress yourself in the style of an elderly gentleman travelling the country pretend to misapprehend ev'ry body in short assume the character of a deaf man and thus disguised put up at his house as if you took it for an inn  MEADOWS  Pho Pho I shall be taken before a Magstrate  CANTEEN  Not you indeed Sir at all these public weddings there are a great number of strangers invited by the chief guests you'll pass as a friend to some of the companyBut grant you are taken for the character you assume an old deaf blundering blockhead your mstakes will create  so much entertainment that nobody will think of turning you out of doors till you have full opportunity of discovering yourself to your mstress  MEADOWS  And do you think she'll lsten to me  CANTEEN  I'm sure of it Sir I'd stake my life to a cartouch box that your letters from camp have been intercepted and some damn'd story trump'd up by that old villain her guardian to make her marry his own son  MEADOWS  It must be so my Sophia otherwise could never have forgot me  CANTEEN  It must be so Lord Sir if you were not so much in love it would appear to you as plain as a pikestaff but when once love gets into a man's head poor reason is brought before a courtmartial of the passions and cashiered without a hearing  MEADOWS  But it will be necessary to apprise Sophia of this if I can by any means convey a letter to her  CANTEEN  A light breaks in upon me I met a little flower girl standing at the inndoor as fresh and as  blooming as the sweetest rose in her basket Don't you imagine a letter may be conveyed by her into the garrison  MEADOWS  Can we trust her  CANTEEN  She's as sure as a rifle barrel SirYou know what a smooth tongue and a smart figure will do with a girl in the country I have persuaded her that I am over head and ears in love with her and have swore by the god of love and the god of battles that I'll make her Mrs Canteen if she pleases before tomorrow morning  MEADOWS  Where is she  CANTEEN  Selling nosegays to passengers as they go in and out of their carriages but I'll bring her to you Sir in the drawing of a trigger in the mean time write your letterThere's pen ink and paper on the table  Exit  Canteen  MEADOWS  Writing  My all depends on her receiving this letterotherwise the surprize of so unexpectedly meeting me might occasion a discovery    Seeing  Canteen  and  Betsy Blossom  Oh here come Mars and Venus already  Enter  Canteen  and  Betsy Blossom  BETSY  Nosegays your Honour  MEADOWS  Come hither my pretty dear and let me see them  Looks in the basket  BETSY  O Sir don't tumble over my basket I can't let you pick and chuse at a common price  CANTEEN  Aside to her  Let him take which he pleases he's as generous as a Prince hussey  BETSY  Is he by Gosh then he shall have the myrtle and the jessamine and the two moss roses I was taking up to the Squire's where the great wedding is to be  MEADOWS  What's that you say Are you going to the house where the great wedding is to be  BETSY  Yes and I shall sell all my nosegays there and am promised a ribban for a bridefavor by John the Butler  CANTEEN  O ho John the Butler I find I'm not sole proprietor of my little nosegay merchant  MEADOWS  Taking her by the band  Now my sweet dear blooming little Flora if you will grant me one favour I will give you a guinea  BETSY  Who I Sir I'd have you to know Sir that I scorn your guineasI am no such parson though I'm poor I'm honest that let me tell you and I'd rather sell nosegays with my vartue than ride in a coach and six without it  CANTEEN  Zounds what an explosion was there from a carbine like a pocket pstolwhy who's going to meddle with your vartue I tell you you may keep the guinea and your vartue together  BETSY  May I  CANTEEN  Yes but I find Betsy I'm greatly deceiv'd in your temper I thought you were as meek as a violet but I find you are as sharp as a sweet briar  MEADOWS  I only want you my dear to take this letter for me and deliver it into the young Lady's  hand who is to be married tomorrow and to take care that nobody sees you  BETSY  As sure as a gun I know who you are  MEADOWS  Ay prithee who am I  BETSY  You are her old sweetheart and she has turned falsehearted  CANTEEN  Oons what a witch it is I'll go and prepare your dress Sir  Exit  Canteen  BETSY  It's the talk of the whole village how Miss Sophia had forsaken a malicious officer that was in love with her  MEADOWS  Will you take this letter for me  BETSY  That I will with all my heart and between ourselves tho' I am a poor girl give her her own into the bargain  MEADOWS  My dear you must not say a word to her only deliver the letter  BETSY  What then you wou'd not have me scold her  MEADOWS  By no means that wou'd ruin me for ever in her esteem but what is your name my love  BETSY  Betsy Blossom an't please you  Curtsying  MEADOWS  Well my dear Betsy go off immediately and remember that the whole happiness of my life depends on your care and secresy  SONG  BETSY  Believe me Sir you'll find me true  As any girl you ever knew  I know no art  To hide my heart  And since with flow'rs first I stood  To young or old  I never sold  Two faces under a hood  Tis true I dress in simple gown  And never saw the flaunting town  Where Ladies shine  In silks so fine  Still I think myself as good  As toasted belle  Whilst I ne'er sell  Two faces under a hood  Exeunt  Meadows  and  Betsy Blossom  SCENE II  Old Wrongward  and  Sternhold  discover'd  Sternhold  reading the Papers to him  Old

his Holiness the Pope was safely delivered of twinsthe mother and children are well and likely to live  OLD WRONGWARD  Truly this is a most extraordinary event if it be a fact and must cause strange confusion among the Cardinals but upon second thoughts it's not altogether past belief for there's a wellknown story of a female Pope who was discovered by her pregnancy Pope Joan I think she was called but give me the paper for damn me if I can believe it yet  takes the paper and reads  Mr Printer if you think the following cross readings  cross readings ha ha haconfound those cross

been out of that chair except at bed times these three months but is roll'd up and down the house like a great baby go to him I say and I'll return immediately  Exit  Sophia  OLD WRONGWARD  You may go

OLD WRONGWARD  Roars out  Zounds you've broke my arm you jade  Sophia  at the back of the Stage  SOPHIA  Betsy  BETSY  I'm coming Ma'am  going  OLD WRONGWARD  Then you won't come and kiss me hussey  BETSY  I think it is you that won't kiss me Sir Lord Sir if you want a kiss why don't you come and take it  OLD WRONGWARD  O you wicked baggage you know that I can't stirI'd give half my estate for a pair of legs to be revenged of you  BETSY  Then you won't setch a walk Sir nor give me a kiss very wellI'll not be denied the next man I askgood by SirI must go ha ha ha  SONG  What refuse me a kiss  I shall die sure with grief  To be robb'd of such bliss  What can bring me relief  One one kiss cruel man  What deny me again  Then I'll go where the willow so green grows  And trembling droops o'er the brook  There to each gentle zephyr that by blows  My sighs shall tell I'm forsook  But why should I if man disdain  To heal this hapless bosom's pain  Compleat the tyrant's triumph quite  And foolish maiden die for spite  No no  I'll go  And since a false one you do prove  I'll die of any thing but love  Exit  Betsy  Enter  Young Wrongward  YOUNG WRONGWARD  What Sir is not Sophia here  OLD
