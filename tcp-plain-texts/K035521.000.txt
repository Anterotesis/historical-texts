inIs this figure really and truly  Emmeline  the beloved and only daughter of great  Northumberland  Every thing about me is so like a dream that I am frighted to think I am awakeO how weary I am of this dress If I had known half that I should have suffered in it all the fairies in the world should not have persuaded me to put it onIf I resided here in this disguise the month of the king's hunting I was to break the spell I was born under and my life was to be happyso the fairy told meYet the time expires tomorrow and nothing has happened to me but vexation and disappointment I must once more see this powerful yet decrepit being who though invisible is always within my call This ring which she gave me convenes her if I take it off and touch it thrice she appearsOncetwicethrice  Elfina  comes forward and touches her  Emm  O fairy my situation is such as I can bear no longer  Elf  Patience for it ends tomorrow  Emm  Tomorrowtomorrow is a thousand yearsWhen the horse has all he can bear a feather will break his back  Elf  What's the matter  Emm  Matter why in the first place I have lived almost a month in a court  Elf  That your sorrow  Emm  That my sorrow yesI that have always lived in my father's principality fair  Northumberland  where a noble simplicity of manners shewed the heart to be open and undersigning have by your persuasion and assistance left it for a place where hypocrisy is avowed by the name of good breeding where the most shameful licentiousness is justified as gallantry dissimulation and perfidy as address and good management where selfinterest is professed as the first principle of wisdom and virtue and public spirit derided as extravagance and superstition  Elf  But your dress was your defence  Emm  O it is my dress that exposes me to more than half that I suffer When one of my own sex is in company I am comparatively happy but how unfit for a woman's ear is the conversation of men when it is not restrained by knowing that a woman is present I begin to fear that I should hot have thought so well even of those men I have been used to converse with if they had appeared to me as they appear to each otherThe friendship and confidence of these lords of the creation have almost robbed me a weak woman of my allegianceI am frighted at the thought of living among them  Elf  Fear not vices you detest  Emm  Fear not but what must I hope O fairy if I have implicitly followed your instructions if I have hidden them in my breast from every friend  and even from good  Northumberland  my father let me no longer suffer the anguish of suspense  Elf  Persevere believe confide  Emm  But I have yet found no object worthy of my love  Elf  You must find and know it not  Such the Fates ordain'd thy lot  Emm  I know the mystery of my fatethat the happiness of my life depends upon my seeing and making a friend of the most beautiful and accomplish'd of men without one thought of loveAlasforgive my doubts my fearsshould you  Elf  Hold of foul mistrust bewareTo  morrow  Emm  Well then till to morrow  Elf  Softunhallowed feet are nigh  Florimond    Emm  O that wretch haunts me like my shadow To rally me for what he calls my virtue seems to be his supreme delight he is proud of his own insensibility to what gives me pain the confusion he throws me into he considers as a test of his own abilities and accomplishments and as vanity is his predominant passion he is so assiduous to secure the enjoyment of his superiority that I can scarce escape him one hour in a day  Elf  He shall work thee woe and weal  As tomorrow shall reveal  Emm  But how wheredear dear fairy  Elf  Ha ha ha How and where must still perplex ye  And in kindness I must vex yeHa ha ha  Elfina  disappears  Emm  GoneMystery perplexity and distress She sports too with my anxiety I almost wish I had not trusted her but 'tis too lateHere comes  Florimond  and my torment begins  Enter  FLORIMOND  singing  Flor  Ha my little  Gondibertus  have I found youWhat all alone  peeping about  Egad I was in hopes there had been a wench in the case and that I might have given thee joy of thy reformation  Emm  Sir I chose to be alone Solitude is sometimes not only useful but pleasant  Flor  Why 'tis a fine moonlight evening indeed  But what the devil  Emm  I have sufficient subject for meditation Sir and I hoped that as there is a ball at the castle tonight you would have been better engag'd than to watch my privacy  Flor  What better engag'd than to raise such a recruit for the beau monde as thou artCome come thou shalt not thus steal away from good company to thyself  Emm  Sir upon my word I'm fit company for none but myself at present  Flor  Pshawwhat always muzzy with a dismal countenance as long as a taylor's bill Come chear up boy I've news for thee  Emm  For me Sir  alarm'd  Flor  Aye to divert thee I mean that's all  Emm  What is it any thing uncommon then  Flor  No faith not very uncommon neither tho' perhaps thou may'st make a wonder of it'Tis only an heiress that's just run away with a young fellow  Emm  That indeed is not so uncommon as might be wish'd But who is she is she of any fashion  Flor  Yes faith she is of some fashion  Northumberland  's fair daughter  Emmeline  that's all  Emm  Oh  Flor  What thy virtue is shock'd at the licent ousness of the age Ha ha haOr art thou a lover of the fair  Emmeline  's hey  Emm  aside  What shall I say my confusion will certainly betray me'Twas only a sudden pain shot cross my breadBut what particulars do you hear  Flor  Why it seems she got leave of her father to follow him hither and it is just accidentally discovered that she left his castle the next day though she has not been here yet  Emm  Well but why do you therefore conclude that she's gone off with a man  Flor  Why only because the duke of  Kent  's son  Edgar  disappeared upon the same pretence just at the same time and both have been missing ever since  Emm  And is this sufficient to authorize a positive assertion to the prejudice of a reputation which hitherto not slander itself has presum'd to stain  Flor  Ha ha ha Not slander itself has presum'd to stain Ha ha ha  Mimicking her  Emm  aside  O my heart what new insult am I doom'd to sufferYou'll excuse me Sir if upon this occasion I take the liberty to tell you that your mirth is rather illtimed and  Flor  Sirdo you know this fair lady that you are so much disposed to become her knighterrant  Emm  aside  I must be cautious or my zeal may discover me Sir though I should not know her it is my point of honour never to suffer the reputation of the absent to be wantonly sported away upon mere circumstances and surmise  Flor  Your point of honourwhy to be sure all this is very fine But I'll tell you a secret my dear As unstain'd as you may think the fair  Emmeline  's reputation there is a certain humble servant of yours that shall be nameless who has some  small  reason to think that a certain piece of brittle ware which she had the keeping of may be a little crack'dor so  Emm  aside  A wretch who never saw me but in this disguiseYou are well acquainted with her then  Flor  WhyI am  Emm  And pray what kind of woman is she  Flor  Why she's a prettyupon my word a very pretty wench  Emm  But is she tall or short or brown or fair  Flor  You have never seen her you say  Emm  No more than I do this moment  Flor  Aside  Then I may ventureWhy she is fair tall and slender has a fine neck a very fine neck her limbs remarkably well turn'd her leg and ancle the finest I ever saw  Emm  distress'd and confounded  Oh  Flor  AyeI thought I should set you a longing but come she's not to be had at present it seems so no more of her  Emm  I cannot so easily dismiss her as you may imagine and yet perhaps you may mistake the reason  Flor  Very likely faith but what is it  Emm  Why I am astonish'd that you make so light of what has happen'd to her whether you consider it as the loss of a mistress or whether as a misfortune to a woman you must be suppos'd to have lov'd and to whom you must have had obligations of the strongest and most tender kind one of these lights you must see it in  Flor  Why my dear as to that I am extreamly easy about losing her for between you and II cou'd spare her I must indeed confess that I was very fond of her once but 'faith the obligations were all on her sideIt's among ourselves  Emm  aside  O my heart what a monstrous compound of vanity and lies is thisHow so pray sir  Flor  Why I us'd to meet her in her father's park night after night at the risk of my life and egad what with the danger and what with the fatigue I grew tir'd of her and to tell you the truth provided her another lover to make good my retreat It's among ourselves  Emm  Well saidand who was that sir  Flor  The very same  Edgar  that she is now run away with I thought it would be a pretty thing for him for he is one of your fighting fellows that is never so happy as when he's in dangerbut I'm sorry he has been so indiscreet  Emm  Pray Sirexcuse meI don't pretend to question the truth of what you say but there are some difficulties in the story that I should be glad to have clear'd upIf you was so much in the lady  Emmeline  's good graces and had as you say no dislike to her person how came you not to think of marrying her Such an alliance I presume would not have dishonoured youI shall confound him now  Aside  Flor  Marrying her Egad she knew a trick worth two o'that I would have married her and I told her so "My dear  Florimond"  says sheher arm was then lying negligently cross my shoulder thus and she look'd archly at me thus  My dear  Florimond  says she why should you and I that have now only the power of making each other happy suffer a doating old priest to give us the power of making each other miserable If you were to be my husband you might cease to be my lover and then  says she with a most roguish leer  perhaps I might be tempted to take another you would tyrannize I should rebel you wou'd enjoy nothing but the hope of breaking my heart and I should enjoy nothing but the hope of breaking yours  Emm  aside  Still still I draw upon myself more confusionBut why then did she run away with  Edgar  That must ruin her schemes both of interest and pleasure  Flor  Nay how the devil can I tell that  Emmeline  walks apart confus'd and embarrass'd  Flor  What in your reveriesThou art now musing on some  vartuous  love like an ever faithful  lovyer tell  deathha ha haCome come pshaw don't be a fool some kind wench now would cure youEgad what think you of  Elfrida  Come along we'll call at her apartment perhaps she's dressing and we shall be admitted to her toilet Upon my soul a fine figure of a woman a little masculine that's all but take my word for it a delicious morsel for all thatHark ye if you are not sheepish she'll not be coy it's among ourselvesI tell you as a friend 'faith I don't love to monopolize I'll just tickle up her fancy a little and leave you together Come  Emm  Pray sir  Flor  I will 'faith  Emm  I must insist  Flor  Nay nay come along come along  Lays hold of her  Emm  Sir I must absolutely be excus'd at present  Flor  Why what a plague is it now that thou hast taken into thy head  Emm  Sir I have an affair that at present requires me to be alone which I cannot farther explain than  Flor  Say no more say no more  aside  Egad I have guess'd it nowA challengewhy there's light enough for two people to cut one another's throats by to be sureI'll awayWell my dear if I must leave you to the dew and the moonshine I must but d'ye hear'faith I'll to  Elfrida  will you follow me If you don't stay too long you'll find an  attendrissement  that you may be oblig'd to your humble servant for that's allit's among ourselves Adieu  Exit  Emm  Why fare thee well thouwretch without a nameWhat will what can become of me  What is it that prompts this fool whom as I never knew I never could provoke to wrong me thus is it a sacrifice to his vanity or is it mere wantonness and sportPray heav'n this fairy don't deceive me What shall I do I must see her and take her counsel in this new distress  She takes off her ring and touches it thrice but the fairy does not appear  Hasure I dream Forlorn desertedthis perfidious goblinAgain I touch it once and twice and thriceand yet she is not hereO I could But though I see her not she may be near me to hear and punish the complaints which her unkindness forces from meTo whom can I now ease my heartO sacred friendshipbut here I have no friend  Elfrida  yes she indeed as if by some secret sympathy claims my confidence and my heart tells me she deserves itYes I will trust her with my secret she will be a witness for me against this slander and assist me with her advice  Exit  The scene changes to  Edgar  's apartment and discovers him at a toilet dressing in the character of  Elfrida  a woman attending  Edgar  Here give me the ribbons Get you goneI'll call you when I want you  Woman  aside  This lady has the strangest humours  Exit  Edgar  Was ever man in such ridiculous distress I'm sure I ne'er knew any thing like it since I was  Edgar  the son of  Kent  Here have I had a young tempting girl fiddlefaddling about me these two hours to dress me forsoothwith an officious handiness so provoking that no virtue under that of a stockfish could endure it patiently Yet an old woman upon these occasions I cannot bear and in short I can no  longer bear a young oneIt is my fate they say to be miserable if I don't get acquainted with the finest girl in  England  without wishing for her and I was told by a little goblin that started up before me after it had led me under the appearance of a Jack o' Lantern into a wood That if I could spend the king's hunting month here in this disguise all would be right but how my being in petticoats should make me less likely to love a fine girl I cannot conceive A fine girl indeed may be less likely to love me but as to myself it is high time for me to get into breeches that I may get out of temptation Here they flock about meone sits down just before me and without any ceremony ties her garteranother gets me to adjust her tuckerI'm the witness of so many pranks and the confidant of so many secrets Then I have my hours of mortification too I am tormented by a swarm of profligate fops who try to debauch every woman they see with as little concern as they take snuff wretches who are as destitute of love as they are of virtue and have as little enjoyment as they have understanding And here I'm obliged to mince and pish and fyeand affect to blush'sdeath when I'm bursting with indignation and long to knock 'em downI'll bear it no longer  ELFINA  suddenly appears from under the toilet and places herself before him  Edgar  Ha What again  Elf  Again  Edgar  Art thou my good or evil genius Tell me  Elf  As you think me you shall find me  Edgar  I will think thee then my good genius for I would fain find thee so  Elf  You must trust me too or else  Edgar  Trust youLook at the figure I make here and then judge if I have not trusted you  Elf  But your virtue must be tried  Edgar  TriedBy what new torments would you try it Have I not suffered the two worst things in nature temptation and suspense Have not I  Elf  Noyou have not persevered all is lost if you give out  Edgar  Resolve my doubts then torment me no longer with suspense let me be certain of the event and I will be an anchorite in spight of this habit and all its works a month longer  Elf  WellObserve me then and learn  Edgar  eagerly  What shall I learn  Elf  Patience  Edgar  Fare thee well Ha ha ha  A machine rises under her and carries her away  Edgar  Derided and forsakenI doubt this is one of the wanton and mischievous elves that tantalize poor mortals for their own diversion however as I have played in the farce so long I'll not stop in the last scene  Enter Woman  Woman  Ma'am here's my lord  Trifle  has sent his compliments to your la'aship and begs to know whether he shall have the honour of waiting upon your la'aship to the ball  Edgar  recovering his female attitude and accent  My compliments am much oblig'd to his lordship but am engag'd  Woman  Yes ma'am  Edgar  Harkye  Woman  Ma'am  Edgar  Has  Gondibert  call'd here this evening  Woman  No ma'am  Edgar  Nor sent  Woman  No ma'am  Exit  Edgar  There's a man now who might atone for the vices of the whole sex I am so anxious to recommend  myself to him even in this disguise and feel such a reluctance to do any thing that may disgust him even while he thinks me a woman that when he is present I labour to make my manner suit with my appearance I know not how by a kind of involuntary effort How strange is the rapidity with which some minds unite  Enter Woman  Woman  Ma'am there's count  Florimond  Edgar  Did not I tell you  Woman  Yes ma'am and I told himbut he said he knew your la'aship was at home and that he must see you  Edgar  Must see me  Woman  Yes ma'am and though I told him your la'aship was adressing yet he would follow meO Lord he's the strangest manHe's here an please your la'aship  Enter  FLORIMOND  Edgar  aside  What a farce must I now act Pray heav'n it has not a tragical catastrophe  Flor  My dear goddess  Edgar  Lard how can you be so monstrous rude bursting into one's dressingroomand putting one into such flurries  He fumbles at pinning on a breastknot  Flor  That your heart beats in concert with mine The dear toilet is not more the altar of beauty than of lovePermit me the honour ma'am of assisting to place that envied ornament on your bosom  Edgar  Lard SirI begnot for the world you quite confound me  Flor  pressing  My life My angel  Catches him hastily round the waist and endeavours to kiss him upon which  Edgar  gives him a smart blow on the ear  Edgar  Nay then there is no expedient  Flor  retreating backward  Ma'am  Edgar  stamps and  Florimond  starts and retreats farther back at the same time  EMMELINE  as  GONDIBERT  appears at the door  Flor  I protest ma'am  frighted  Edgar  sternly  And I protest Sir  Flor  Ma'am I beg  Edgar  And I beg Sir  Flor  turning and seeing  Gondibert  OMa'am your most humble servant  going  Emm  aside to  Flor  SirI am under very great obligations to youbut I would not have you tickle up her fancy any more upon my account  Flor  Duce take youI wish you had been as near her as I was  Is going but again stops and adjusts his wig by a pocket mirrour  Edgar  to  Emmeline  recovering himself and adjusting his dress  Lord SirI'm in such a flurryI I I I'm very sorry I should have been provok'd to any thing so unbecoming the delicacy of my sex  Flor  Upon my soul so am I tooSir your humble servant  Exit  Emm  You have no reason to apologize for your indignation  madam though your blow was something spirited I must confess  Edg  I'm in such confusion sirand he has made me such a figureto treat  me  with indecent familiarities  Emm  Dear madam compose yourself and think no more of him He has not been much better company to me than he has to you I'll assure you  Edgar  Lord sir you surprise mePray what impertinence has he been guilty of to you  Emm  He has been filling my ears with scandal madam a subject which seems to be equally suitable both to his abilities and disposition He has been telling me that  Edgar    Edgar  Who sir  hastily  Emm  Edgar  madam the son of the earl of  Kent    Edgar  What of him sirwhat scandal has he spread of  Edgar    Emm  aside  Ha so interestedShe loves him sure  Edgar  Let me conjure you sir if this wretch has said any thing to dishonour  Edgar  you would tell it to  me  Emm  aside  It must be soYour very earnestness forbids me madam  Edgar  I know I'm mov'd and you must think it strange  Emm  surpris'd at the masculine tone and manner into which his earnestness involuntarily betrays him  Strange indeed  Edgar  Perhaps 'tis stranger still than you can think  Emm  Your manner madam  Edgar  No matter Forms and modes become trifles too small for notice when they stand in competition with a friend's good name  Emm  aside  Her love is to distractionShe frights me and is not to be trusted  Edgar  Let me conjure youtell me  Emm  I cannot tell you madam  Edgar  Cannot  Emm  I ought notTrust me there are reasons Let it suffice that in the story I have heard a lady's honour is as much concern'd as  Edgar  's that the slander cannot interest you more than me that I will do my utmost to make it's falsehood so notorious that it cannot be believ'd and I entreat that as you tender your peace you would as yet enquire no fartherI know myself not proof against your importunity and therefore you will excuse me if having no other way I save myself by flight  Exit  Edgar  runs out after her but returns  Edgar  Curse on this cumbersome habit I cannot overtake him Was ever any thing so vexatious I have been defam'd by some scandalous falsehood and I must do my honour justiceI can at a small expence of dissimulation get that wretch  Florimond  to repeat to me all that he has told to  Gondibert  I will do itand I will as yet lie in ambush under this disguise to make sure of my blow  Exit  EMMELINE  as  GONDIBERT  reenters  Emm  She's goneWhat can I or what ought I to do If I had told her the story I must have discovered myself to convince her it could not be true but who knows what a jealous woman might have thought upon finding the very person who is said to have gone off with her lover in so strange a disguise Yet she will certainly contrive to hear it from  Florimond  and then good heaven what will she suffer  if I do not convince her that it is falseI must I will trust herI have no other chance to save her but by making a discovery which if I had really gone off with  Edgar  it is certain I should not have made especially to her But I must not intrude upon her now I will plant myself where I may intercept her before she can see  Florimond  and trust to generous friendship for the event  Exit  END of the FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  The Terrace at  Windsor Castle  Enter  FLORIMOND  with a Letter  Flor  AYEshe was obliged to be angry because that fool  Gondibert  appear'd just in the critical minute at the doorpox take himI might have known it was not natural by her overdoing itit was indeed overdone with a vengeance But now she's in the pannicks lest I should resent it Now she has something to sayandif I am disengag'dshe will be glad to meet me upon the terrace If I should humble her now and not meet herbut that would be cruel I will however take some state upon meI will look a little formal it may save me some trouble in my future advancesHere she comes  Enter  EDGAR  still disguis'd as  ELFRIDA  Florimond  receives him with an air of negligent haughtiness and makes a formal bow  Edgar  Sir I hope you will not take any advantage of my weakness  Flor  turning from her  Weakness pox on you Your weakness don't lie in your arm I'm sure o'that  Edgar  following  Or suppose sir that whatever reason I may have for desiring this meetingWhat airs the wretch gives himself  aside  I say sir that you would not supposeI cannot contain myself  Aside  Flor  Poor soul what confusion I will relax a little of my severity  Aside  Madam I will suppose nothing but that you have given me another opportunity of hearing your commands  Edgar  I think sir you was telling  Gondibert  a certain affair between you and  Edgar  and a lady and something that by his manner of telling it I could not very well understand  Flor  aside  Ayea very good introductiona lovestory is a most excellent prelude to a lovescene I perceive we are to adjournWhy madam a certain fair lady call'd  Emmeline  has thought fit to make  Edgar  as happy as any man can be made except him madam whom you shall please to honour with the same favourUpon my soul she's a fine creature  Edgar  Sir your compliments really put me so out of countenancethat I shall blush to death  Flor  Your blushes are so becoming madam that  Edgar  Give me leave sir to entreat that you would at present spare my confusion and tell me all the particulars of that affair which have come to your knowledge  Flor  Ayeshe wants a luscious description now  aside  Why madam I presume that  Edgar  being fir'd with the charms of  Emmeline  first gaz'd languishingly upon her caught her eyes the first time they were casually turn'd upon him when in a soft confusion she hastily turn'd her look downward and blush'd he took her hand first pressing it gently in his own then raising it to his lips then madam I presume he might proceed to  Edgar  SirI shall certainly be out of patience and knock him down  aside  Sir if you have any desire to oblige meor have any expectations sir of favoursNot sir that I  Flor  My dear angel keep me no longer in suspense let me know your commands that I may fulfil the condition of  Pressing  Edgar  drawing back  Hold SirYou must then without farther delay or interruption give me a direct answer to a few short questions  Flor  Why madam it shall then be in your own way  Edgar  First then Sir are you acquainted with  Edgar  the young heir of  Kent  Flor  Why madam to proceed implicitly as you direct I believe there are few persons who know more of that gentleman than your humble servant  Edgar  aside  Matchless impudenceAnd pray Sir what kind of a youth is he  Flor  aside  I see by her curiosity she don't know himWhy madam the youth is a a a rather softa green youth madam as we say  Edgar  Sir these are terms that I do not perfectly comprehend and therefore I beg you would be more explicit  Flor  Why then explicitly madam he is upon my soul a shallow fellowa very shallow fellow faithIt's among ourselves  Edgar  He is  Flor  He is indeed madamThe poor devil has some aukward good nature and I have a kindness for him but between you and I he'll never be so much a man of honour as I could wish him  Edgar  forgetting his feminine character and running up to him  How villain  Flor  frighted and drawing back  Ma'am  Edgar  aside  What have I done  he draws himself again into form  To think of villainy in people that by their rank are set up as examples to others quite transports me out of myselfHeigh hoIt has quite overcome me  Affects to be faint and takes out a smelling bottle  Flor  aside  What a terrible virago it isMay I presume madam to lend you my hand  approaching cautiously  Edgar  It is over SirI'm so subject to flurriesand my poor nerves are so shattered I'm extremely obliged to you for this character of  Edgar  To have been guilty of any thing base  Flor  Very base I assure you madam  Edgar  Sir  assuming a fierce masculine air but instantly correcting himself  Flor  Ma'am  starting back  Fore Gad she's mad and upon my soul in my opinion damnably mischievous  aside    Edgar  Give me leave siras well as I am able to ask you what in particular hasbut I see company comingIf we walk this way we shall avoid them  Flor  aside  Avoid themHeaven forbidPerhaps madam another time  Edgar  Sir I shall die if my curiosity is not gratified  Flor  Madamat present I am  Edgar  Sir I begfor my reputation that we may not be surpriz'd together while I am in this disorder  Flor  By no means madamlet us part this momentIf you'll go off one way I'll go the other  Edgar  O not for the worldTo be seen to part hastily upon being observed together would be the subject of eternal scandalLet me beg the favour of your arm  lays hold of his arm  Flor  crying out  Lard Gad madam  Edgar  Sir  Flor  You'll pinch it through  Edgar  Lord Sir 'tis my frightOne naturally clasps any thing hard in a fright  Flor  Madam you do me honour  Edgar holds his arm he keeps as far off as he can and fixes his eyes upon him as they go out  By the heavens she has the gripe of a bumbailiff  aside  Exeunt  SCENE  the dark Grove  Enter  ELFINA  Elf  Sister sister

moon's inconstant light  Potent spell of midnight hours  By the ring of various dies  Circling oft the silver ball  By the genial mists that rise  By the virgin dews that fall  By the meteor's gleamy spark  Wand'ring o'er the reedy lake  Stars that shoot athwart the dark  Lights from polar skies that break  By Night and all things that to Night pertain  Ye rival powers from adverse arts abstain  Intrude not now my purpose to contest  But let the pair that I would bless be blest  Elf  Cease the fated hour is nigh  Cease and to the castle fly  Careful watch the great event  Finish'd ere the day be spent  Fairies and the scene disappear together  Enter  EMMELINE  still disguised as  GONDIBERT  Emm  She's gone out and I have unfortunately missed herShe is certainly got to  Florimond  Ha yonder they areYes it is certainly soWhat violent emotionNow they move hastily forward Now she stops shorther gestures are scarce feminineNow she recovers herself  Florimond  too seems to be frighted out of his gallantry and extremely willing to put an end to the conversation'Tis over he leaves her and she comes this wayYes I will open my whole heart to her not for my sake now but her own Whatever are the first fallies of her surprize and passion she must at length feel and return my friendshipHere she comes I must not accost her too abruptly  Retires to a little distance  Enter  EDGAR  still as  ELFRIDA  Seeing  EMMELINE  he stops short  Edgar  Ha  Gondibert  I know the generous reason now of his reserve In this disguise what could my interest in  Edgar  appear to him but loveand if it had been so how must I have been hurt by what he had to tell meBut he is not less interested in the ladyso he saidSure then he is to  Emmeline  what he thought  Edgar  was to meLet me then repay his generous kindness let me discover not only  what  but  who  I am to convince him that the tale is false which if true must destroy his peace  Going up to  Emmeline  You need not shun me sir I have now nothing to ask that you would wish to conceal I have only to request that you would forgive me for having violated your injunction not to satisfy the curiosity you had raised I am apprized of your kind your generous motive and it has inspired my breast with all that it is possible I should feel for you a grateful and ardent friendship  Emm  Your love madam I make no doubt is fixed on a much nobler and more deserving object  Edgar  I presume  Edgar  My connection with  Edgar  sir is indeed in some sense the reason why your merit cannot make an impression which I am not ashamed to say it might otherwise have done and yet sir let me confess that I am not affected by the story of his disappearing with  Emmeline  as you might reasonably imagine because I know for  certain  that it  cannot  be true  Emm  hastily  Ha that it cannot be true  Edgar  I now owe  your friendship  a discovery if indeed it is a discovery which I was prompted by mere  regard to myself  to have made before I think there is a connection between you and  Emmeline  that  Emm  There is indeed a connection madam a secret which you convince me it is now in vain to affect to hide  Edgar  Let me then claim itBut let me first as a pledge of that friendship which I hope shall end but with our lives give for your secret mine  Emm  Do then nor keep me longer in suspense for still the more we talk the more I am perplexed  aside  What can  her  secret be  Edgar  Why then in the first place sirI am a man  Emm  aside with great emotion which she labours to conceal  A manGood Heav'n what will become of me  Edgar  And now let me at once embrace you as a friend punctilios and forms no longer part us  As  Edgar  advances eagerly to  Emmeline  she hides her face and appears in great confusion  Edgar  hastily  What ails my friend  Emm  O you have ruined all my pleasing project preventedbut no matter  Edgar  This is amazing For heaven's sake what d'ye meanYou was not sure enamoured of my person  Emm  O noYou still mistake  Edgar  Then tell me my mistake for we may now converse on even terms our hearts may now be opened to each other without the forms and the reserve prescribed in friendships with the softer sex  Emm  O still you wander wide and wider still I cannot speak  Edgar  You mustThere is a secret which but now your heart was ready to reveal  Emm  And then I thought it knownbut now  Edgar  Now my warm heart has claimed you for my friend  Emm  And now to tell it is impossibleI cannot tell itand if I could you would not find the friendship that you hope  Edgar  looks earnestly at her wond'ring and embarrass'd  aside  I sicken at his sightOh my heart  Edgar  I'm all perplexity and wonderYour colour comes and goes like a sick girl's  She becomes more confused as he marks her confusion  You trembleHeavens he faints  he catches her in his arms and discovers her breast  By all my wonder and my joy a womanHow lovely her confusionO let my bosom warm thee back to life Look up and trust the honour of my love you shall not whisper what you would conceal nor will I seem to know it  She recovers  Emm  O let me hide me from myselfmy sex thus knownin this disguise Where shall my conscious blushes find a veilWho are you Tell me that I may hide me from your sight for ever  Edgar  O noOn that condition let me ne'er be known  Emm  Yet tell metrust me  Edgar  Trust thee Yes with my life I'd trust thee Thy friendO know me by a softer name is  Kent  's young heir that  Edgar  you have heard so falsely and so wantonly traduc'd  Emm  Still wonders crowd on wonders  Edgar  I dream myself or this is all enchantment  Emm  So might you think indeed if more you knew me  Edgar  Let me then know thee more whom now I know as the most fair and gentle of thy sex whom yet I saw and lov'd without desiremy pledge of happinessMay I be thinebut yet I ravethy fate was not like  Edgar  's  Emm  Spare methy words have pow'r which yet thou know'st not  Edgar  O take me from the rack My thoughts grow wildThere is indeed a maid whose fate I've heard was such as minethat  Emmeline  O heav'n that  Emmeline  in whom I thought thy interest loveO yes it must it shallthou thou art she  Emm  Leave me or I shall die with my confusion  Edgar  Let me support thee hide thee in my breast where thou shalt breathe thy answer in a sighArt thou not  Emmeline  my fated love  Emm  If  Emmeline  be thy fated loveI am  Edgar  Still let me clasp thee close and closer still calm all the tumults of thy feeling mind and sooth thee into confidence by love  Emm  No let me now retire for in this dress I cannot bear to see myself or you  Edgar  Yet stayforgive the violence I do you My fame and yours are wantonly traduc'd 'tis fit that we do justice to them both and punish the traducer  Emm  He is not worth resentment  Edgar  He is for others sakes though not his own I have a thought would  Emmeline  but join  Emm  Tell me then quickly  Edgar  Send him a challenge in behalf of  Emmeline  as  Gondibert  and meet him not as  Gondibert  but  Emmeline  I will take care to be present not as  Elfrida  but  Edgar  he will then be selfconvicted as a liar by knowing neither of the persons he has defam'd and we may farther punish him as we please  Emm  Well I will try at this but now dismiss me  She breaks from his hand and runs off  Edgar  Farewel my loveHow has the hand of heav'n vouchsafed to guide me through all the mazes of my fate to bliss Even my revenge my justice  rather upon that wretch whose very folly is invenom'd shall be compleatBut a mind so base can never be braveSuppose he should not comeHe's here  Enter  FLORIMOND  Seeing  EDGAR  he stops short  Flor  Gad take methis damn'd madwoman is certainly fated to be my death  Edgar  advances towards him he draws back and looks frighted  Edgar  Sir I am so shock'd when I reflect upon the indecorums that my passions have made me guilty of to you and my poor spirits are so flurried that I really am not able to make my 'pology  Flor  Ma'am I'm extreamly sorryand ma'am I must absolutely fly from your ladyship's apology  Going  Edgar  Sir I must beg the favour of your ear for a few minutesI hope sir you will pardon my confusionI have something to say to you sir that Let me beg sir that you would come a little nearer  Flor  aside  Pox on hershe wants to fasten her damn'd claws upon me again  To her  Your commands madam always do me honourAnd upon my soul always leave me black and blue  Aside  Edgar  I have just heard sir something that has flustered me to such a degree  Flor  aside  Ayeanother fright she'll certainly lay hold of me  retiring  Ma'ama a a I hope there's no danger threatens your ladyship  Edgar  Not directly me sir nor indeed much danger to you but I was willing you should be prepared  Flor  Dangerpreparedfor heav'n's sake madam what d' ye mean  Edgar  Why  Gondibert  siryou'll excuse my freedomLard that I should be so indiscreetI'm sensible that the interest I take in the affair may be liable to constructions of such a naturethat  Flor  Lord ma'am if there is any villainous design against me I beseech you to let me know it  looking about  Perhaps we had better change our ground some villain may be taking aim at me as I stand  Edgar  You need not be under such apprehensions sir it is a matter of no consequenceIt is only that  Gondibert  is to send you a challenge for the liberty you have taken with lady  Emmeline  that's all  Flor  Oh if it's only an intention of  Gondibert  to cut my throat to be sure that's a matter of no consequenceA bloodyminded ruffian▪  Aside  Edgar  Why sir to my certain knowledge  Gondibert  knows no more of a sword than a girl of eighteen and has not a grain more courage  Flor  taking courage  Why as to that madam  Edgar  As to that sir I am confident it would make no difference to you but as I know he won't fight and only presumes upon an insolent opinion that count  Florimond  's courage is as questionable as his own  Flor  blustering  How madam  Edgar  Lard sir if you are so violent I shall certainly fall into my tremorsI shall certainly want the support of your arm  Flor  Aside  Mercy upon me and I shall want but very little killing afterwards if you do  Edgar  I say sir I think he should be properly expos'd and I hope you'll act accordingly  Flor  Madamexcuse mea coward is my aversion and you may depend upon his being chastised with most exemplary severity but I should be sorry to mistake his character  aside  You know he won't fight  Edgar  a little hastily  Sir if you suspect my veracity  Flor  O Lord madamno not in the least  Edgar  You'll excuse me sir I am really asham'd of the liberty I have takenSir your humble servant  Exit  Flor  Madam your most obedientThank heav'n she's goneIt was a lucid interval but it would not have been of much longer continuance I'm oblig'd to her though for her informationindeed am I Egad I'll make a figure in this businessBut if the challenge is coming I must be at home to

FLORIMOND  Flor  This is the place and this is the timebut I see no signs of my little  Gondibertus  Ha here comes a  bona roba  whom I have not the honour to knowEgad this affair will turn out with an eclat very much to my honourI'll make the most of it I'll let her into my business here without seeming to see her  Emmeline  enters in her own habit and observes him he affects not to see her but walks hastily to and again often looking on his watch affecting great impatience and speaking as to himself  A poltron not to meet me upon his own challenge I'll make him know what it is to insult a man of honour  If the wretch had met me I would have given him his life but now to spare hima scandal to mankind Ha  affects to be surpris'd at seeing  Emmeline  'Death interrupted and discovered

something that would have had worse consequences  Flor  Madam I am not at liberty  Emm  By the few words sir which just now involuntarily escaped you I know that you are waiting here upon an affair of honourbut I intreat  Flor  Madam it is impossiblenothing but his life can atone for the insult  Emm  You will excuse a woman though a stranger sir upon such an occasion may I intreat to know sir who has had the misfortune to incur the resentment of a gentleman who seems so little to deserve ill treatment and so able to punish it  Flor  Madam you do me honourShe is making advances already  aside  Why madam as the treatment I have received makes it an act of justice to tell what I should otherwise rather die than discover I will comply with your requestHem A little dirty dependant upon the court here madam one  Gondibert  thought fit to send me a challenge upon account of something I happened to say concerning a lady in whole good graces I happen'd to be and whom a foolish young fellow that I was a friend to has thought fit to run away with and madam though I have so far treated him like a gentleman as to accept his challenge he has not come to the place appointed and it is now half an hour past the time  Emm  looking out  Methinks I see somebody at a distance coming this way perhaps that may be the gentleman  Flor  starting and looking out as afraid  Ah egad that's certainly he

Edgar  With what elegance and dignity he looks the man  Edgar  aside  How soft how lovely in her female dress  Emm  to Florimond  Sir as we are now no longer alone I may confess that I am not altogether a stranger to your person or your merit  To Edgar  Sir this is  Florimond  a gentleman to whom both you and I have some obligations which I believe he is not at present aware of  Flor  Upon my word madam you absolutely confound methis excessive honouris it possible that I should have been so happy as to confer obligations pray madam may I crave the honour of your name  Edgar  Do you not at all recollect that lady sir  Flor  Upon my soul sir I cannot say that I do  Edgar  Who now do you think it can possibly be of all that your polite generosity has oblig'd  Flor  Let me perish sir if I can tell  Edgar  Why sir that lady is one  Emmeline  with whom as she tells me you was formerly most intimately acquainted and whom you lately conversed with sir in disguise by the name on  Gondibert  it's among ourselvesWhat quite confounded sir  Flor  recovering himself  Ha ha ha confounded Ha ha ha No no sir you have had your jest and I have had mine I knew well enough who I was talking to when I play'd upon the little  Gondibertus  Ah I thought I should make you smart for your frolicI told  Elfrida  my whole scheme  Edgar  You told  Elfrida  your whole scheme  Emm  But pray sir as you did not know my person in my own dress how came you to know me in disguise  Flor  Why madam to confess the truth I was let into the secret by a friend  aside  Egad this goes swimmingly  Edgar  Well sir but pray give me leave to bring you acquainted with a person who I'm sure you are at present totally a stranger toPray who do you think I am  Flor  aside  Heaven knows but I wish I was fairly out of your clutchesUpon my soul sir I have not the honour to know you any otherwise than as a gentleman whom I should be extremely proud to consider as my friend  Edgar  Why sir I have the honour to be one  Edgar  a very shallow fellow sir that you had some kindness for because he was aukwardly goodnatured I have also had the honour to receive several of your civilities under the name of  Elfrida  It's among ourselves  Flor  Sir your most humble servantI have at this time some urgent business  Edgar  So have I sir and therefore you must not leave me yetYou may remember sir that you told me your whole scheme to punish  Emmeline  for her frolick and to mortify her with stories of herself by way of joke  Flor  Sir I beseech you  Edgar  Sir I am extremely sorry for the occasion but as this lady has not got her fighting cloaths on  you must excuse me if I take her challenge upon myself and so sir  draws  it's among ourselves  Emm  What has my thoughtless indiscretion done  Flor  Ah dear sir now you are too serious  Emm  This must not beFor heav'ns sake  Edgar  hear me  Edgar  Fear not my loveSir whatever you may think this is but sport to what is to followand so sir without more words  Flor  O Lord sirI beseech you madam  Emm  For my sake  Edgar    Edgar  Trust meDraw sir or  Flor  Sir I don't desire to do you any harm I don't upon my soul sir  Edgar  Scoundrel coward

beneath your resentment  Flor  So it is indeed sira great deal better  Emm  He is worthy only of contempt  Flor  It is very true indeed sir  Edgar  Art thou not a wretch without the least principle of truth or honour  Flor  Yes sir  Edgar  Art thou not infamous as a slanderer and a coward  Flor  Yes sir  Edgar  Have not thy very follies the malignity of vices and is it not a disgrace to nature to consider thee as a man  Flor  Any thing dear sir if you will but spare my lifeIf you chuse any other satisfaction sir if you would be content to kick me into some dark corner  and leave me I should

lovers but who first were friends  EPILOGUE Written by Mr GARRICK Spoken by Mrs YATES  OLD times old fashions and the Fairies gone  Let us return good folks to sixtyone  To this blest time ye Fair of female glory  When pleasures unforbidden lie before ye  No  Sprites  to fright you now no guardian  Elves  Your wise directors areyour own dear selves  And every Fair One feels from old to young  While these your guidesyou never can do wrong  Weak were the sex of yoretheir pleasures few  How much more wife more spirited are  You  Would any Lady  Jane  or Lady  Mary  Ere they did  this  or  that  consult a  Fairy  Would they permit this saucy pigmy crew  For each small slip to pinch 'em black and blue  Well may you shudderfor with all your charms  Were this the casegood heaven what necks and arms  Thus did they serve our grandames heretofore  The very thought must make us moderns sore  Did their pour hearts for cards or dancing beat  These  Elves  rais'd blisters on their hands and feet  Tho'  Loo  the game and fiddles play'd most sweetly  They could not squeeze dear  Pam  nor foot  Moll Peatly  Were wives with husbands but a little wilful  Were they at that same  Loo  a little  skilful  Did they with pretty fellows laugh or sport  Wear ruffs too small or petticoats too short  Did they no matter how disturb their cloaths  Or everlilied add a little rose  These spiteful Fairies rattled round their beds  And put strange frightful nonsense in their heads  Nay while the husband snor'd and prudish aunt  Had the fond wife but met the dear gallant  Tho' lock'd the door and all as still as night  Pop thro' the keyhole whips the Fairy Sprite  Trips round the room"My husband" madam cries  "The devil where" the frighted beau replies  Jumps thro' the windowshe calls out in vain  He cur'd of loveand cool'd with drenching rain  Swears"Dem him if he'll e'er intrigue again"  These were their tricks of oldBut all allow  No childish fears disturb our Fair Ones now  Ladies for all this trifling 'twould be best  To keep a little  Fairy  in your breast  Not one that should with moderate passions war  But just to tweak youwhen you go too far
