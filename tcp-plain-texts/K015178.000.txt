 THRENODIA AUGUSTALIS SACRED TO THE MEMORY Of HER late ROYAL HIGHNESS The PRINCESS DOWAGER of WALES Spoken and Sung in the GREAT ROOM at  SohoSquare  on  Thursday  the th of  February    LONDON Printed for W WOODFALL in  WhiteFriars  MDCCLXXII  Advertisement  THE following may more properly be termed a Compilation than a Poem It was prepared for the Composer in little more than two days and may therefore rather be considered as an industrious Effort of Gratitude than of Genius  In justice to the Composer it may likewise be right to inform the Public that the Music was adapted in a period of time equally short  SPEAKERS  Mr LEE and Mrs BELLAMY  SINGERS  Mr CHAMPNES Mr DINE AND Miss JAMESON WITH Twelve CHORUS SINGERS  THE MUSIC PREPARED AND ADAPTED BY Signor VENTO  THRENODIA AUGUSTALIS  OVERTURE a solemn Dirge  AIR TRIO  Arise ye sons of worth arise  And waken every note of woe  When truth and virtue reach the skies  'Tis ours to weep the want below  CHORUS  When truth and virtue reach the skies  'Tis ours to weep the want below  MAN SPEAKER  THE praise attending pomp and power  The incense given to kings  Are but the trappings of an hour  Mere transitory things  The base bestow them but the good agree  To spurn the venal gifts as flattery  But when to pomp and power are join'd  An equal dignity of mind  When titles are the smallest claim  When wealth and rank and noble blood  But aid the power of doing good  Then all their trophies lastand flattery turns to fame  Blest spirit thou whose fame just born to bloom  Shall spread and flourish from the tomb  How hast thou left mankind for heaven  Even now reproach and faction mourn  And wondering how their rage was born  Request to be forgiven  Alas they never had thy hate  Unmoved in conscious rectitude  Thy towering mind selfcentered stood  Nor wanted Man's opinion to be great  In vain to charm thy ravished sight  A thousand gifts would fortune send  In vain to drive thee from the right  A thousand sorrows urged thy end  Like some wellfashion'd arch thy patience stood  And purchased strength from its encreasing load  Pain met thee like a friend that set thee free  Affliction still is virtue's opportunity  Virtue on herself relying  Every passion hush'd to rest  Loses every pain of dying  In the hopes of being blest  Every added pang she suffers  Some encreasing good bestows  And every shock that malice offers  Only rocks her to repose  SONG By a MAN  Affettuoso  Virtue on herself relying  Every passion hush'd to rest  Loses every pain in dying  In the hopes of being blest  Every added Pang she suffers  Some encreasing good bestows  Every shock that malice offers  Only rocks her to repose  WOMAN SPEAKER  Yet ah what terrors frown'd upon her fate  Death with its formidable band  Fever and pain and pale consumptive care  Determined took their stand  Nor did the cruel ravagers design  To finish all their efforts at a blow  But mischievously slow  They robbed the relic and defac'd the shrine  With unavailing grief  Despairing of relief  Her weeping children round  Beheld each hour  Death's growing pow'r  And trembled as he frown'd  As helpless friends who view from shore  The labouring ship and hear the tempest roar  While winds and waves their wishes cross  They stood while hope and comfort fail  Not to assist but to bewail  The inevitable loss  Relentless tyrant at thy call  How do the good the virtuous fall  Truth beauty worth and all that most engage  But wake thy vengeance and provoke thy rage  SONG by a MAN  Basso Staccato Spirituoso  When vice my dart and scythe supply  How great a king of Terrors I  If folly fraud your hearts engage  Tremble ye mortals at my rage  Fall round me fall ye little things  Ye statesmen warriors poets kings  If virtue fail her counsel sage  Tremble ye mortals at my rage  MAN SPEAKER  Yet let that wisdom urged by her example  Teach us to estimate what all must suffer  Let us prize death as the best gift of nature  As a safe inn where weary travellers  When they have journeyed thro' a world of cares  May put off life and be at rest for ever  Groans weeping friends indeed and gloomy sables  May oft distract us with their sad solemnity  The preparation is the executioner  Death when unmasked shews me a friendly face  And is a terror only at a distance  For as the line of life conducts me on  To death's great court the prospect seems more fair  'Tis nature's kind retreat that's always open  To take us in when we have drain'd the cup  Of life or worn our days to wretchedness  In that secure serene retreat  Where all the humble all the great  Promiscuously recline  Where wildly huddled to the eye  The beggars' pouch and princes' purple lie  May every bliss be thine  And ah blest spirit wheresoe'er thy flight  Through rolling worlds or fields of liquid light  May cherubs welcome their expected guest  May saints with songs receive thee to their rest  May peace that claim'd while here thy warmest love  May blissful endless peace  be thine above  SONG By a WOMAN  Amoroso  Lovely lasting peace below  Comforter of every woe  Heavenly born and bred on high  To crown the favourites of the sky  Lovely lasting peace appear  This world itself if thou art here  Is once again with Eden blest  And man contains it in his breast  WOMAN SPEAKER  Our vows are heard Long long to mortal eyes  Her soul was fitting to its kindred skies  Celestiallike her bounty fell  Where modest want and patient sorrow dwell  Want pass'd for merit at her door  Unseen the modest were supplied  Her constant pity fed the poor  Then only poor indeed the day she died  And Oh for this while sculpture decks thy shrine  And art exhausts profusion round  The tribute of a tear be mine  A simple song a sigh profound  There faith shall come a pilgrim grey  To bless the tomb that wraps thy clay  And calm religion shall repair  To dwell a weeping hermit there  Truth fortitude and friendship shall agree  To blend their virtues while they think of thee  AIR CHORUS  Pomposo  Let us let all the world agree  To profit by resembling thee  END OF THE FIRST PART  PART II  OVERTURE PASTORALE  MAN SPEAKER  FAST by that shore where Thames' translucent stream  Reflects new glories on his breast  Where splendid as the youthful poet's dream  He forms a scene beyond Elysium blest  Where sculptur'd elegance and native grace  Unite to stamp the beauties of the place  While sweetly blending still are seen  The wavy lawn the sloping green  While novelty with cautious cunning  Through every maze of fancy running  From China borrows aid to deck the scene  There sorrowing by the river's glassy bed  Forlorn a rural band complain'd  All whom AUGUSTA's bounty fed  All whom her clemency sustain'd  The good old sire unconscious of decay  The modest matron clad in homespun grey  The military boy the orphan'd maid  The shatter'd veteran now first dismay'd  These sadly join beside the murmuring deep  And as they view the towers of Kew  Call on their mistress now no more and weep  CHORUS  Affettuoso Largo  Ye shady walks ye waving greens  Ye nodding tow'rs ye fairy scenes  Let all your ecchoes now deplore  That She who form'd your beauties is no more  MAN SPEAKER  First of the train the patient rustic came  Whose callous hand had form'd the scene  Bending at once with sorrow and with age  With many a tear and many a sigh between  And where he cried shall now my babes have bread  Or how shall age support its feeble fire  No lord will take me now my vigour fled  Nor can my strength perform what they require  Each grudging master keeps the labourer bare  A sleek and idle race is all their care  My noble mistress thought not so  Her bounty like the morning dew  Unseen tho' constant used to flow  And as my strength decay'd her bounty grew  WOMAN SPEAKER  In decent dress and coarsly clean  The pious matron next was seen  Clasp'd in her hand a godly book was borne  By use and daily meditation worn  That decent decent dress this holy guide  AUGUSTA's care had well supply'd  And ah she cries all woe begone  What now remains for me  Oh where shall weeping want repair  To ask for charity  Too late in life for me to ask  And shame prevents the deed  And tardy tardy are the times  To succour should I need  But all my wants before I spoke  Were to my mistress known  She still reliev'd nor sought my praise  Contented with her own  But every day her name I'll bless  My morning prayer my evening song  I'll praise her while my life shall last  A life that cannot last me long  SONG By a WOMAN  Each day each hour her name I'll bless  My morning and my evening song  And when in death my vows shall cease  My children shall the note prolong  MAN SPEAKER  The hardy veteran after struck the sight  Scarr'd mangl'd maim'd in every part  Lopp'd of his limbs in many a gallant fight  In nought entireexcept his heart  Mute for a while and sullenly distress'd  At last the impetuous sorrow fir'd his breast  Wild is the whirlwind rolling  O'er Africk's sandy plain  And wild the tempest howling  Along the billow'd main  But every danger felt before  The raging deep the whirlwind's roar  Less dreadful struck me with dismay  Than what I feel this fatal day  Oh let me fly a land that spurns the brave  Oswego's dreary shores shall be my grave  I'll seek that less inhospitable coast  And lay my body where my limbs were lost  SONG by a MAN  Basso Spirituoso  Old Edward's sons unknown to yield  Shall crowd from Cressy's laurell'd field  To do thy memory right  For thine and Britain's wrongs they feel  Again they snatch the gleamy steel  And wish th' avenging fight  WOMAN SPEAKER  In innocence and youth complaining  Next appear'd a lovely maid  Affliction o'er each feature reigning  Kindly came in beautiey's aid  Every grace that grief dispenses  Every glance that warms the soul  In sweet succession charm'd the senses  While pity harmoniz'd the whole  The garland of beauty 'tis thus she would say  No more shall my crook or my temple adorn  I'll not wear a garland AUGUSTA's away  I'll not wear a garland until she return  But alas that return I never shall see  The ecchoes of Thames' shall my sorrows proclaim  There promis'd a lover to come but oh me  'Twas death 'twas the death of my mistress that came  But ever for ever her image shall last  I'll strip all the Spring of its earliest bloom  On her grave shall the cowslip and primrose be cast  And the newblossom'd thorn shall whiten her tomb  SONG by a WOMAN  Pastorale  With garlands of beauty the queen of the May  No more will her crook or her temples adorn  For who'd wear a garland when she is away  When she is remov'd and shall never return  On the grave of  AUGUSTA  these garlands be plac't  We'll rifle the Spring of its earliest bloom  And there shall the cowslip and primrose be cast  And the newblossom'd thorn shall whiten her tomb  CHORUS  Altro Modo  On the grave of  AUGUSTA  this garland be plac't  We'll rifle the Spring of its earliest bloom  And there shall the cowslip and primrose be cast  And the tears of her country shall water her tomb  THE END
