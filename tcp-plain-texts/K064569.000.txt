 A DISCOURSE On the MIRACLES of our SAVIOUR  In View of the Present Controversy between  Infidels  and  Apostates  Nostrum est tantas componere Lites  By Thomas Woolston sometime Fellow of  Sidney  College in  Cambridge  LONDON Printed for the Author Sold by him near  MoreGate  and by the Booksellers of  London  and  Westminster  Price one Shilling  To the Right Reverend Father in GOD  Edmund  Lord Bishop of  London  My Lord  UPON no other View do I make a Dedication of this Discourse to your  Lordship  than to submit it to your acute Judgment expecting soon to hear of your Approbation or Dislike of it If it so happen that you highly approve of it I beg of you to be sparing of your Commendations least I should be puff'd up with them  In my  Moderator  some Expressions dropt from ny Pen about the Miracles of our Saviour which for want of Illustration then gave your  Lordship  some offence and brought upon me more Trouble But having now fully and clearly explain'd my self out of the Fathers I hope you'll be reconciled to me and as you are a Lover of Truth will against Interest and Prejndice yield to the Force of it  Whether your Prosecution of me for the  Moderator  was just and reasonable I'll not dispute here having already expostulated that matter with you in several Letters to which you would not condescend to give me any Answer For what Reason you was silent is best known to your self But in my own Vindication I hope I muy publish without Offence that your taking me for an  Infidel  was such a Mistake as I thought no  Schoar  could have made and the Injury done to my Reputation and low Fortunes by the Prosecution so considerable that the least I expected from your  Lordship  was a courteous Excuse if not an ample Compensation for it  As to the Expediency of prosecuting  Infidels  for their writings in whose Cause I am the farthest of any Man from being engaged I will here say nothing The Argument  pro  and  con  has already by one or other been copiously handled And I don't know but I might be with your  Lordship  on the persecuting side of the Question but that it looks as if a Man was distrustful of the Truth of Christianity and conscious of his own Inability to defend it or he would leave that good Cause to God himself and the Sword of the Spirit without calling upon the  Civil Magistrate  for his Aid and Assistance  That Scurvy  Writer  of the  Scheme of litteral Prophecy    c  which your  Lordship  must have heard of would insinuate that they are only Atheistical  Priests  who for fear of their Interests in the Church set Persecutions on foot But after your  Lordship  has publish'd a Strenuous Defence of Christianity to the Purpose of our present Controversy I'll have no such suspicions of you  Your  Lordship  's persecuting or if you will prosecuting Humour is reputedly all pure Zeal for God's Glory and with all my Heart let it be so accounted whether it be according to Knowledge or not Against Popery and Infidelity you are all Ardency Who do's not commend you Who can question the sincerity of the Zeal of a Protestant  Bishop  and of a Prostestant  Clergy  when they persecute the Enemys of their Church that considers their own steadiness to Principles against Interest under all Changes  since the Reformation and their Abhorrence of Extortion upon the People for the Dutys of their Function in and about this City Such Honesty and Constancy in their Profession is a Proof of the Integrity of their Hearts or I know not where to find one  But that your  Lordship  's Zeal for Religion is very remarkable and successful I could prove by many Instances one is  that  of your routing a turbulent Sect of  Peripateticks  our of St  Paul  's Cathedral and if you could as effectually clear  Christ  's Church of  Infidels  what a Glorious Bishop would you be  And what Pitty is it that  Infidels  likewise are not to be quell'd with your Threats and Terrors which without the Weapons of sharp Reasonings and thumping Arguments that others are for the Use of would transmit your Fame to Posterity for a notable  Champion for Christianity as certainly as that your judicious Prosecution of the  Moderator  for Infidelity is here remembr'd by  My Lord  The Admirer of your Zeal Wisdom and Conduct Thomas Woolston  London  April th  A DISCOURSE On the MIRACLES of our SAVIOUR  c  _IF ever there was an useful Controversy started or revived in this Age of the Church it is  this  about the  Messiahship  of the Holy Jesus which the  Discourse of the Grounds  c has of late rais'd I beleive this Controversy will end in the absolute Demonstration of Jesus's  Messiahship  from Prophecy which is the only way to prove him to be the  Messiah  that great Prophet expected by the  Jews  and promised under the Old Testament And tho' this way of Proof from Prophecy seems to labour under many Difficulties at present and tho' some  Writers  against the  Grounds  being distressed with those Difficulties are fo  eeking Refuge in the Miracles of our  Saviour yet we must persist in it till what I have no doubt of his  Messiahship  shall be clearly made out by it  And the way in Prophecy that I would take for the Proof of  Jesus  's  Messiahship  should be by an Allegorical Interpretation and Application of the Law and the Prophets to him the very same Way that all the Fathers of the Church have gone in and the very same Way in which all the Ancient  Jews  say their  Messiah  was to fulfil the Law and the Prophets But this Way does not please our Ecclesiastical  Writers  in this Controversy neither will they at present give any Ear to it  The Way in Prophecy that they are for taking is by a Litteral Interpretation and Applcation of some Prophecys of the Old Testament to our  Jesus  but they are hitherto unsuccessful in this Way The Authors of the  Grounds  and of the  Scheme  grievously perplex them with their Objections against this Way of Proof so far as being sensible I say of almost insuperable Difficultys in it they are flying apace to the Miracles of our Saviour as to their sole and grand Refuge  But to show that there's no Sanctuary for them in the Miracles of our Saviour I write this Discourse And this I do not for the service of Infidelity which has no Place in my Heart but for the honour of  the Holy  Jesus  and to reduce the  Clergy  to the good old way of interpreting Prophecys which the Church has unhappily apostatis'd from and which upon the Testimony of the Fathers will one Day be the Conversion of  Jews  and  Gentiles  For this Opinion that there is no Sanctuary in the Miracles of our Saviour I chanc'd to say in the  Moderator    Page  That Jesus's Miracles as they are now a days understood make nothing for his Authority and Messiahship  and again  p  that I believe upon good Authority some of the Miracles of Jesus as recorded by the Evangelists were never wrought but are only related as Prophetical and Parabolical Narratives of what will be mysteriously and more wonderfully done by him  Which expressions gave offence to some of our  Clergy  and brought upon me their Indignation and Displeasure I see no Reason to depart from the said Expressions or so much as to palliate and soften them much less to retract them but in maintenance of my Opinion to the Honour of our  Messiah  and and the Defence of Christianity I write this Treatise on Jesus's Miracles and take this method following  I I will show that the Miracles of Healing all manner of Bodily Diseases which  Jesus  was justly famed for are none of the proper Miracles of the  Messiah  neither are they so much as a good Proof of his Divine Authority to found a Religion  II That the litteral History of many of the Miracles of Jesus as recorded by the Evangelists does imply Absurditys Improbabilities and Incredibilitys consequently they either in whole or in part were never wrought as they are commonly believed now a days but are only related as Prophetical and Parabolical Naratives of what would be mysteriously and more wonderfully done by him  III I shall consider what Jesus means when he appeals to his Miracles as to a Testimony and Witness of his Divine Authority and show that he could not properly and ultimately referr to those he then wrought in the  Flesh  but to those Mystical ones which he would do in the  Spirit  of which those wrought in the Flesh are but mere Types and Shadows  In treating on these Heads I shall not confine my self only to Reason but also to the express Authority of the Fathers those holy venerable and learned Preachers of he Gospel in the first Ages of the Church who took our Religion from the Hands  of the Apostles and of Apostolical Men who dy'd some of them and suffer'd for the Doctrine they taught who professedly and confessedly were endew'd with Divine and Extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit who consequently can't be supposed to be corrupters of Christianity or teachers of false Notions about the Miracles of our Saviour of so much as mistaken about the Apostolical and Evangelical Sense and Nature of them I know not how it comes to pass but I am a profound Admirer and an almost implicit Believer of the Authority of the Fathers whom I look upon as vast Philosophres very great Scholars and most Orthodox Divines Whatever they concurrently assert I firmly believe And tho' they are for the most part mysterious Writers out of the Reach of the Capacitys of many who slight them yet I who have had the Honour and Happiness of much of their Acquaintance fancy my self well apprised of their meanings If at any time I read a Passage in them which I don't presently apprehend I salute it with Veneration for all that till my Understanding is open'd to receive the sense of it If I meet with but a single Opinion in any one of them I pay my Respects to it but where there is an Harmony and Agreement of Opinion amongst them it is with me and  ought to be with all Christians of such Weight as to bear down all Prejudice Opposition and Contradiction before it or the Authority of no Man whether Ancient or Modern is to have any Regard paid to it and of what ill Consequence to Religion such an utter Rejection of Authority will be I need not say  This I thought fit to premise concerning the Authority of the Fathers to abate of the Prejudice beforehand which some may conceive against the following Discourse about the Miracles of  Jesus  I don't question but some may be startled at the foregoing Heads as if what is the farthest of any thing from my Heart the service of Infidelity was in View but craving the Temper and Patience of such Readers for a while and they shall find that it's no other than just Reasoning clear Truth and Primitive Doctrine about  Jesus's  Miracles that I advance or if it should so happen that none besides my self should discern the Reasoning and Truth of the Argument yet I hope it will not be thought a Crime to revive Primitive Doctrine which none will be able to deny it to be whether they like it or not If I err I err upon Choice with the Fathers of whose Faith I am And if any are offended at what follows about the Miracles of  Christ  let them turn  their Displeasure and Indignation against the Fathers for whose express or implicit Opinions I can be deserving of no Blame  I am sorry for the occasion of such a Preface against Offence which the Apostacy of the Age and its Unacquaintedness with the Fathers has made necessary So I enter upon the particular Handling of the Heads foregoing And  I I will show that the Miracles of Healing all manner of Bodily Diseases which  Jesus  was justly famed for are none of the proper Miracles of the Messiah nor are they so much as a good Proof of  Jesus's  Divine Authority to found and introduce a Religion into the World  And to do this let us consider first in general what was the Opinion of the Fathers about the Writings of the  Evangelists  in which the Life of  Christ  is recorded  Eucherius  says  Universam porro Sacram Scripturam tam Novi quam Veteris Testamenti ad allegoricum sensum esse sumendam admonet nos vel illud Aperiam os meum in Parabolis  In Prasat  ad Form Spirit Intell  That the Scriptures of the New as well as Old Testament are to be interpreted in an Allegorical Sense  And this his Opinion is no other than the common one of the first Ages of the Church as might be proved by many the like Expressions  of other Fathers As in such Expressions they do not except the Writings of the  Evangelists  so they must include the History of  Christ's  Miracles which as well as other Parts of the Hystory of his Life is to be allegoriz'd for the sake of its true meaning consequently the litteral Story of Christ's Miracles proves nothing  But let's hear particularly their Opinion of the Actions and Miracles of our Saviour  Origen  says that  Si quidem Symbola quaedam erant quae tunc gerebantur eorum quae Jesu virtute semper preficiuntur  In  Mat  C  xv  whatsoever Jesus did in the Flesh was but Typical and Symbolical of what he would do in the Spirit  and to our Purpose  Omnis languor omnis Infirmitas quam san  avit salvator tunc in Populo referuntur ad Infirmitates spirituals Animarum  c In  Mat  C  xvii  that  the several bodily Diseases which he heal'd were no other than Figures of the spiritual Infirmities of the Soul that are to be cured by him  St  Hilary  is of the same Mind with  Origen  as any one may see by the  Christi Gesta aliud portendunt  In  Mat  C  Evangelicis gestis est interior Sensus  c  Haec licet in praesens gesta sunt quid tamen in futurum significent contuendum est  c  Peragunt forma  futuri gesta praesentia  c    Expressions referr'd to and his Commentary on St  Matthew  St  Augustin  Quoe a Jesu facta sunt alicujus significantia erant  Serm    and St  John  Omne quod fecit Jesus Sacramenta sunt  Homil    in  Marc  of  Jerusalem  both say that the Works of Jesus import farther Mysteries and with them the rest of the Fathers agree making the Miracles that Jesus did then no more than the Shadow of some more powerful and mystical Operations to be done by him as I could show by more Citations out of them if it was needful But from the foregoing Citations out of the Fathers it is plain in their Opinion that our modern  Divines  are in the wrong of it to lay much Stress on any of the Operations of Jesus which he did in the Flesh for the Proof of his Divine Authority and  Messiahship  which is only to be proved by his more mysterious Works of which those done in the Flesh were but Type and Figure  But to come closer to the Purpose let's see how indifferently I had almost said contemptibly the Fathers speak of the Miracles of  Jesus  and particularly of his Power of Healing all bodily Diseases which by modern  Writers  is so much magnified and extoll'd St  Irenaeus  says  Si enim temporalis erat ab eo Utilitas nihil grande praestitit iis qui ab eo curati sunt  LV  c  S    that if  we consider only the then temporal Use of Jesus's Power  of Healing he did nothing grand and wonderful  consequently  Irenaeus  could not hold that Jesus's Miracles then wrought were a sufficient Proof of his Divine Authority much less of his  Messiahship Origen  says  Contra Celsum  L    that  tho' many were brought to believe in Jesus upon the fame of the Miracles which he did once among the  Jews  yet  what implies the insufficiency of them for the Conversion of Men  he intimates that his greater and mystical Works do prove his Authority  St  John  of  Jerusalem  says  Coecum curavit magnum quidem est quod fecit sed nisi quotidie fiat quod olim factum nobis quidem magnum esse cessavit  Homil    in  Marc  that  Jesus's cures perform'd upon the Blind  c  were indeed considerable and great but unless he do daily as mighty Works in his Church we ought to forbear our Admiration of him  St  Augustin  not only says  Si humano captu ingenio consideremus Jesum facientem quod ad potestatem non magnum aliquid fecit quod ad benignitatem parvum secit  in  Johan  cap  v Tract  that  if we examine into Jesus's Miracles by humane Reason we shall find he did nothing great considering his Almighty Power and considering his Goodness what he did was but little  but he tells us also that  Etsi attestabantur Miracula non defuissent sicut nunc mussitant qui magicae potentiae cuncta illa tribuerent  Cont Faust  L XII c  such Works as Jesus did might  be imputed to and effected by magic Art  And accordingly  Moses  and our Saviour himself confess that false Prophets and false Christ's will do Miracles and  Antichrist  himself according to St  Paul  will do them to the Deception of Mankind Nay the Fathers  Vid  Sanctum Augustinum  de  Antichristo  say what I believe that  Antichrist  will imitate and equal  Jesus  in all his Miracles which he wrought of old How then can we distinguish the true Prophet from the false the true Christ from the Anti christ by Miracles Our Divines will find it hard to do it if what the Fathers say of  Antichrist  be found true Moreover History affords us Instances of Men such as of  Apollonius Tyanaeus    Vespasian  and of the  Irish Stroker    Greatrex  who have miraculously cured Diseases to the Admiration of Mankind as well as our Jesus but if any of them or any other greater Worker of Miracles than they were should withal assume to himself the Title of a Prophet and Author of a new Religion I humbly conceive we ought not to give heed to him  Neither is there the least Reason that we should for the Power of doing Miracles is no certain nor rational Seal of the Commission and Authority of a Divine  Lawgiver St  Paul  says  i Corinth C xii  there is a  Diversity of the Gifts of the Spirit for to one is given by the Spirit the Word of Wisdom to another the Word of Knowledge to another the Gift of Healing to another the working of Miracles to another Prophecy to another Discerning of Spirits to another Divers Kinds of Tongues to another the Interpretation of Tongues  These Gifts may be given a part and separately One of them may be conferr'd on this Man and another of them on his Neighbour There is no necessity that any two or more of these Gifts should meet in one Man To argue then that a Man who has one of these Gifts must needs have the other that is that he must needs have the Gift of Wisdom or of Prophecy or of Discerning of Spirits or of Divers kinds of Tongues because he has the Gift of Healing and of working Miracles is very inconclusive and false Reasoning And yet this is the Reasoning of our modern Writers who would prove  Jesus's  Authority to found a Religion from his Miracles I don't question but  Jesus  had all the foresaid Gifts and Powers of the Spirit in a most superlative Degree but then it is unreasonably inferr'd for all that that  a Man because he of certainty has some of them must of consequence have the other St  Augustin  Atque illud ad Rem maxime partineat ne decipiamur tendentes ad Contemplationem Veritatisarbitrantes ibi osse invisibilem sapientiam ubi Miraculum visibile viderimus  In Sermon Dom in montc L    Sect    Cautions us against being deceived into a good Opinion of a Man's Wisdom because of his Power to do Miracles And I think accordingly that we may as well say that the strongest Man is the wisest or that a good Physician must needs be a good Casuist or that the best Mathematician is the ablest Statesman as that  Jesus  because he was a worker of Miracles such as his are and a Healer of all manner of Diseases ought to be received as the Guide of our Consciences the Director of our Understandings the Ruler of our Hearts and the Author of a Religion  What then will the Writers against the  Grounds  do to prove  Jesus's  Authority and Messiahship from his Miracles Or how by his Miracles will they be able to distinguish him from an Impostor a false Prophet and the  Antichrist  Why they will say perhaps  That besides Greatness of Power there was nothing but Goodness Kindness and Love to Mankind shewn in  Jefus's  Miracles As to the Miracles of false Prophets and Impostors if they be many of them of a kind and benevolent Aspect yet the  Devil's  Foot if we look well to it will discover it self in some ludicrous and mischeivous Pranks But  Jesus's  Miracles were all of a beneficent Nature He went about doing good healing all manner of Diseases among the People and did no wrong to any one which is a good Argument they say of his Divine Authority or God would not have suffer'd nor the Devil have work'd such a Testimony in behalf of it On this Head our  Divines  are copious and rhetorical and many notable and florid Harangues have they made on it But  In Answer to them they don't seem to have their Memories at Hand when they declaim at this Rate The Fathers upon whose Authority I write will tell such Orators that  Jesus  if his Miracles are to be understood in the litteral sence did not only as foolish Things as any Impostor could do but very injurious ones to Mankind I shall not here instance in the seemingly foolish and injurious things which Jesus did for Miracles intending under the  next Head to speak to some of them But they are such if litterally true as out Divines do believe as are enough to turn our stomachs against such a Prophet and enough to make us take him for a  Conjuror  a  Sorcerer  and a  Wizard  rather than the  Messiah  and Prophet of the most High God But  To prove the Messiahship of the Holy Jesus from his Miracles our  Divines  urge the Prophecys of the Old Testament such as that of  Isaiah  C XXXV v  Then the Eyes of the blind shall be opened and the Ears of the Deaf shall be unstopp'd then shall the lame Man leap as the Hart and the Tongue of the Dumb sing  and say that these Prophecys were accurately fulfill'd by our  Jesus  in the several specifical Cures of Blindness Deafness Lameness and Dumbness which he often perform'd upon one or other and in asmuch as our Saviour seems to appeal to such Prophecys do conclude this his Accomplishment of them to be no less than a Demonstration that he was the true  Messiah  that great Prophet who was to came into the World To which I answer  First  That the Accomplishment of Prophecys that can neither be given forth by human Foresight nor fulfill'd in a Counterfeit are good Proofs of  Jesus's  Messiahship  But then what shall we say if others besides  Jesus  should do the like Cures and Miracles It is said of  Antichrist  and I believe it that he will not only do all the Miracles that Jesus did but will appeal to the like Prophecys too How then we are to distinguish the true Christ from the false Christ by Miracles and Prophecys in this Case is the Question which I leave with our Divines to consider of an Answer to against the Time that it is proved that  Antichrist  does all those Miracles which  Jesus  in the Flesh wrought But  Secondly  The foresaid Prophecys and others mention'd in  Isaiah  neither were nor could be Prophecys of the miraculous Cures of bodily Diseases which Jesus  then  did And this may be made appear not only from the Context of those Prophecy's which received then no Accomplishment from  Jesus  who ought to have fulfill'd one Part of the Prophecy as well as the other or is not to be taken for the Fulfiller of either bur from the Opinion of both  Jews  and  Fathers  who adjourn the Accomplishment of those Prophecys to Christ's Spiritual Advent But  Thirdly  The Prophet  Isaiah  in the Place above cited speaks not of bodily Blindness which the  Messiah  is to heal but of  the spiritual Distempers of the Soul metaphorically so call'd as may be easily proved not only from the Prophecys themselves but from the old  Jews  who were Allgorical Interpreters of those Distempers and from the antient Fathers  Interim completur et Isaiae Prophetia non tantum in corporalibus verum etiam in Spiritualibus Origen  In Matt Cap  xv Aperientur igitur Oculi caecorum aures surdorum audient nam qui quondam divinis sermonibus rejectis mysticam Sanctorum Institutionem recipere non studuerunt libenter eam admittent St  Cyril in  Loc Is  Vide et sanctum Hieronymum in Loc Isai  who so understood them Consequently our  Jesus's  Healing of those bodily Diseases was no proper Accomplishment of those Prophecys It is true our Saviour  Matt  xi seems to appeal to those Prophecys and to make his Cure of corporal Distempers an Accomplishment of them But he means not in the litteral sense that our  Divines  take him in as I shall show hereafter when I come to consider what  Jesus  means by appealing to his Works and Miracles as bearing Witness of him  Our  Divines  then may admire and adore  Jesus  as much as they please for his Miracles of Healing bodily Distempers but I am for the spiritual  Messiah  that cures those Distempers of the Soul that metaphorically  pass under the Names of Blindness Lameness Deafness  c  And the Cure of these Spiritual Diseases is the Proper and Miraculous Work of the true Messiah for the sake of which says  Et nunc majores sanitates operatur propter quas non est dedignatus tune exhibere illas minores  In Serm    St  Augustin  Jesus condescended to do those  little  Miracles of healing bodily Distempers which were but the Type and Shadow of his more stupendous Miracles of Curing Spiritual Diseases The Cure of Spiritual Infirmities is a Godlike  In quibus Spiritualibus maxime Christi Persona eminet  August Quaest    in Lucam  Work above the imitation of Man or of  AntiChrist  infinitely more Miraculous than the Healing any Bodily Distempers can be  Whether our Jesus be at this Day such a Spiritual Messiah I leave to our Divines to consider with those Spiritual Distempers of the Church that seem to want his Miraculous Hand and Touch The Fathers of the Church said that  Jesus  was  in part  such a Spiritual  Messiah  in their Time and argued  Modo Caro caeca non aperit oculos miraculo Domini sed cor caecum aperit oculos sermoni Domini Modo non refurgit mortale cadaver sed resurgit anima quae mortua jucebat in vivo Cadavere c  August Serm  S  his Messiahship not from bodily  Cures but from his most Miraculous Cures of the Diseases of the Soul But there was another and future Time in which he would be such a Spiritual and Glorious  Messiah  to the greatest Perfection In the mean while no Healing of Corporal Distempers can prove  Jesus  to be the Messiah nor any other of his Miraculous Works recorded in the Evangelists so far from it That  II I shall prove that the litteral Story of many of Jesus's Miracles as they are recorded in the Evangelists and commonly believed by Christians does imply Improbabilities and Incredibilities and the grossest Absuidities very dishonourable to the Name of Christ consequently they in Whole or in Part were never wrought but are only related as Prophetical and Parabolical Naratives of what would be Mysteriously and more Wonderfully done by him  The reading of this Head will I doubt not strike with Horror some of our squeamish  Divines  who notwithstanding they will Sacrifice almost any Principles to their Interest will not bear that our Litteral Evangelical History of such renown'd Miracles should be thus call'd in Question and contemptuously spoken of What does this  Author  mean will some say thus to do service to Atheism and Infidelity Away  with him Our Indignation is moved against him No Censure and Punishment can be too severe for such Impiety Profaneness and Blasphemy as is aim'd at and imply'd in this Proposition  To calm therefore the Spirits and abate the Prejudices of such Accusers I must proceed with the greater Caution and with Reason and Authority well fortifie my self before and behind or I shall feel the Weight of the Displeasure of our  Divines  who are prepossess'd of the Belief of the Litteral Story of all Jesus's Miracles  Before then I enter upon the particular Examination of any of his Miracles I will premise two or three general Assertions of the Fathers about them And first  Origen  Historia Scripturae interdum interserit quaedam vel minus gesta vel quae omnino geri non possunt interdum quae possunt geri nec tamen gesta sunt  De Principiis Lib    says that in the Historical Part of the Scriptures  there are some Things inscrted as History which were never transacted and which it was impossible should be transacted and other things again that might possibly be done but were not  This he asserts of the writings of the  Evangelists  as well as of the Old Testament and gives many Instances to this Purpose St  Hilary  Multa sunt quae non sinunt nos simplici sensu dicta evangelica suscipere Interpositis euim nonnullis Rebus quae ex Natura humani sensus sibi contraria sunt Rationem quaerere caelestis Intellgentiae admonemur  In Matt L  xx  S    says  there are many Historical Passages of the New Testament that if they are taken litterally are contrary to Sense and Reason and therefore there is a Necessity of a Mystical Interpretation  And St  Augustin  Evangelica Sacramenta in Christi factis signata omnibus non patent et ea nonnulli minus diligenter interpretando afferunt plerumque pro salute Perniciem et pro Cognitione Veritatis Errorem c  De Quest Divers Quest    says that  there are hidden Mysterys in the Works and Miracles of our Saviour which if we inca  iously and literally interpret we shall run into Errors and make grievous Blunders  Of the same Mind are the Rest of the Fathers as might be proved by express or implicit Citations but studying Brevity I think the three Testimonys above enough to cool the Rage and assuage the Prejudices of my Adversaries against the Proposition before us which I now come to a particular Consideration of that is to shew that the story of many of  Jesus  's Miracles is literally absurd improbable and incredible And  To speak to that Miracle of Jesus's  driving the Buyers and Sellers out of the  Temple  which all the  Matt C xxi Mark C xi Luke C xix John C ii  four Evangelists make Mention of  I have read in some modern Author whose Name dos not occur to my Memory that this was in his Opinion the most stupendous Miracle that  Jesus  wrought And in truth it was a most astonishing one if literally true and  Jesus  must appear more than a Man he must put on an awful and most Majestick Countenance to effect it It is hard to conceive how any one in the Form of a Man and of a despised one too and we don't read that  Jesus  chang'd his human shape with a Whip in his Hand could execute such a Work upon a great Multitude of People who were none of his Disciples nor had any regard for him supposing he could by his divine Power infuse a  Pannick  Fear into the People yet what was the Reason that he was so  eaten up  with zeal against the Profanation of that House which he himself came to destroy and which he permitted I may say commanded to be filthily polluted not long after Put not to form by my self an lnvective against the letter of this Story let's hear what the Fathers say to it  Origen  makes the whole but a  In Comment in Matt C xxi  Parable His allegorical Expositions of it are frequent and one time or other he gives us the mystical meaning of every Part of it By the Temple he understands the Church By the sellers in the Temple he means such Preachers who make Merchandise of the Gospel whom the Spirit of Christ some Time or other would rid his Church of He is so far from believing any Thing of the Letter of this Story that he has form'd a  Porro cui curae est accuratior Inquisitio considerabit an juxta dignitatem praesentis Vitae erat ut Jesus rem talem auderet facere extrudere videlicet Mercatorum Multiudinem qui ad Diem festum ascenderant Distributuri boves ditioribus et tanto populo oves mactandas per domos familiarium quae multorum millium complerent numerum atque eos qui in rebus talibus gloriantes producturi erant in medio Columbas quas multi empturi erant ceu in Conventu celeberrimo convivaturi Considerabit hic etiam an Nummulariorum erat non accusare Jesum contumeliose

ulciscens Cum praesertim haberet tantam multitudinem eorum qui sibi aeque contumeliam fieri credebant faventem sibi adversum Jesum Insuper censideremus Dei filium funiculos sumentem sibique flagellum

attempted any such Thing the People would have resisted and executed their Revenge on him If he had effected it the Merchants of the Temple might have reproach'd him with Damage done to their Wares and would have justly accused him of a Riot against Law and Authority Whether there is not Reason in this Argument of  Origen  let any one judge  St  Hilary  is of the same Mind with  Origin  He says that this Story is only a  Praefiguratio futurorum dictis praesentibus continetur In Matt C xxi  Praefiguration of what will be done in Christ's Church upon another Occasion And he admonishes  Admonemur altius Verborum Virtutes in istius modi significationibus contuendas  ibid  us to search into the profound and mystical Import of every Part of it Particularly he hints that  In Cathedra est sacordotii sedes et eorum qui Spiritus sancti Donum Venale habent Cathedras evertet Ibid  by the Seats of those who sell Doves may be understood the Pulpits of Preachers who make sale of the Gifts of the Spirit which is represented by a Dove As to the Letter of the Story he is plain enough that there was no such  Non habebant Judaei quod venire possent neque erat quod emere quis posset  Ibid  Market kept  in the Temple of  Jerusalem  and if any Historians besides the  Evangelists  had asserted it I know of none who would have been so foolish as to believe that Oxen and Sheep and Goats were there sold  St  Ambrose  too is for the Mystery and against the Letter of this Story saying  Cathedra autem Vendentium Columbas cur everterit secundum Litteram non intellgo Admonet Typo ejectorum de Templo hujusmodi Mercatorum in Ecclesia Dei Cousortium eos habere non posse qui sancti Spiritus Gratiam nundinentur  In Loc Luc  what should be the Reason that Jesus should overturn the Seats of those that sold Doves This must be says he a Figurative Story and signifies nothing less than the future Ejection of Priests out of his Church who shall make Gain and Merchandise of the Gospel  St  Jerome  as his manner is in other Cases first gives us a Litteral Exposition of this Miracle as far as it will bear it But then corrects himself again saying there are  Juxta simplicem Intelligentimquod penitus absurdumcaeterum secundum Mysticos Intellectus Jesus ingreditur Templum Patris et ejicit omnes Episcopos Presbyteros et Diaconos c  In Loc Mat  Absurditys in the Letter but according to its Mystical Meaning Jesus will enter his Temple of the Church  and cast out of it Bishops Priests and Deacons who make a Trade of Preaching and in another Place he tells us of the Mystical  Faciet Dominus Flagellum de Scripturarum Textuum Testinoniis  In Zechar  C xiv  Whip that Jesus will make use of to this Purpose  St  Augustin  also is against the Letter of the Story of this Miracle saying  Non magnum Peccatum si hoc vendebant in Templo quod emebatur ut offerretur in Templo  In Loc Johan  where could be the great Sin of selling and buying things in the Temple that were for the Use of it and offer'd as Sacrifice in it  We must therefore says he look for the Mystery in this  Qui sunt tamen qui boves vendunt ut in figura quaeramus Mysterium facti qui sunt qui Oves vendunt et Columbas ipsi sunt qui sua quaerunt in Ecclesia non quae Jesu Christi  Ibid  Figurative Story and enquire what is ment by the Oxen and Sheep and Doves and who are the sellers of them in Christ's Church and he is very positive that Ecclesiasticks who are selfish and make Worldly Gain of the Gospel are here meant And as to the Expression of turning the Temple into a Den of Theives he says it has Respect to the  Vox enim fecistis Domum meum Domum Negotiationis etspeluncam Latronum significat futuros in Ecclesia L ii  Evang Quaest Quast    Clergy in Time to come who would make such a Den of Christ's Church  Lastly with the foregoing Fathers agrees St  Theophylact  who is an Allegorist too upon this Miracle saying that those    In Johan  C ii  who sell Doves are the Priests who sell Spiritual Gifts and that Christ sometime or other would overturn their Seats and clear his Church of them In another Place he intimates what are meant by Oxen and Sheep  viz  the litteral Sence of the Scriptures And if the litteral Sence be irrational and nonsensical the Metaphor we must allow to be proper in as much as nowadays dull and foolish and absurd stuff we call Bulls Fa  lings and Blunders  Behold a wonderful Harmony among the Fathers in their Rejection of litteral and espousal of the mystical Sense of this Miracle It is said of the Church in her first Ages that she was inspir'd and so she was or before an Hire for the Priesthood was established and pleaded for she could never have written in this fashion If the Fathers had lived now and written thus we should have thought the Spirit of  Quakerism  was gotten amongst them or they would never have given such an Exposition  of this Story of favour an Enmity to an Hireling Priesthood  How and when Chris'sts Power according to the Figure and Parable before us will enter his Church and drive out of her these Ecclesiastical Merchants is not the Question But when ever it dos so effectually it will be a stupendous Miracle Much greater than the Typical one is supposed to be and not only a Proof of Christ's divine Power and Presence in his Church but an absolute Demonstration of his  Messiahship  from his Accomplishment both of the foresaid Prophecys of the Fathers and of other remarkable Ones of the Old Testament which will be then clearly understood and which it is not my Business here to apply or mention  Against the aforesaid Exposition of this Miracle perhaps it may be Objected that excepting a little Reasoning against the Letter of it this is only the chimerical and whimsical Dream of the Fathers whose Notions are obsolete and who  Chandler's Vindication  c  p  have adulterated Christianity with their Cant and Jargan  and that none of our Protestant and Orthodox  Divines  have ever given into their Opinion  I confess that that none of our Protestant  Divines  whom I know do embrace the  foresaid Exposition of the Fathers but it may be nothing the worse for all that And tho' their Exposition may be very disagreeable to the Priesthood of this Age yet I can tell them of the greatest Man of these last Ages and that was  Erasmus  who cautiously expressing himself for fear of giving Offence to the  Clergy  is of the same Mind with the Fathers or he would not say that  Hoc facto longe aliud significabat Jesus nec enim illum tantopere commovebat Templum illud mercimoniis Boum Ovium Hircorum et Columbarum profanatum sed oftendere voluit Avaritiam et Quaestum fore capitalem Pestem Ecclesiae quam Templum cujus Religio mox erat abolenda figurabatIn nullum Hominum Genus acrius saeviit Jesus sed hos ipse sibi servavit ejiciendos cum videbitur  In Loc Matt  C xxi  that Work of Jesus did prefigure somewhat else For Jesus could not be zealous against the Profanation of that Temple of the Jews which was soon to be destroy'd but meant to shew his dislike and hatred of Ecclesiastical Covetousness which after the Way of the Type he would take his Opportunity to rid the Church of  Before I dismiss this Miracle I must observe that if the Fathers are right above then out  Latin  and  English  Translations of the place in St  Matthew  err in a main Point Instead of reading  and Jesus cast out them that sold and bought  it should be  those who sold and preach'd  that is sold what they preach'd For the Word  do's more properly signifie to  preach  than to  buy  and in this sense here according to the Fathers it should be construed  Again I must observe that our Commentators are a little perplex'd to know who and what those  MoneyChangers  were The Greek  Vid Suicerum in    Word dos import those who have a Knack to barter away little base and brass Money with the Effigies of an Ox or Bull on it in Exchange for good Coin How applicable the Word was to any Merchants of the old Temple at  Jerusalem  is hard to conceive But it is very agreeable to our Ecclesiastical  Collybists  who as I may appeal to Freethinkers vend their brasenfaced Bulls and Blunders at an extravagant and great Price And if  which is translated  Tables  do's properly signifie  apud Aristophanem est Pulpitum Vide Scapulam  Pulpits  who can help it  So much then on the Miracle of Jesus's driving the Sellersand Buyers out of the Temple And now I appeal to our  Divines  whether it be not an absurd improbable and incredible Story according to the Letter and whether it be any other  than as the Fathers said of it a prophetical and parabolical Narative of what would be mysteriously and more wonderfully done by Jesus And so I come to speak to a  Second Miracle of Jesus and that is that of his  Matt C viii Mark C v Luke C viii  casting the Devils out of the Madman or Madmen and permitting them to enter into the Herd of Swine which thereupon ran down a Precipice and were all choaked in the Sea  To exorcise or cast Devils out of the Possess'd without considering the Nature of such a Possession or the Nature and Power of the Devil we'll allow to be not only a kind and beneficent Act but a great Miracle But then be the Miracle as great as can be imagin'd it is no more than what false Teachers  Luke C xiii v  Workers of Iniquity  and even some Artists amongst the  Jews  have before done consequently such a Work of  Exorcism  in our Saviour could be no Proof of his Divine Authority And if there was no more to be said against this Miracle this is enough to set it aside and to spoil the Argument of  Jesus  's Divine Power from it But there are many Circumstances in the Story  litterally consider'd that would induce us to call the Truth of the Whole into Question How came those Madmen to have their dwelling amongst the Tombs of a Burying Ground where was the Humanity of the People that did not take Care of them in Pitty to them as well as for the Safety of others Or if no Chains as the Text says which is hardly credible could hold them it was possible surely as well as lawfull to dispatch them rather than their Neighbours and Passengers should be in Danger from them Believe then this Part of the Story who can But what's worse its not credible there was any Herd of  Swine  in that Country If any Historians but the  Evangilists  has said so none would have believed it The  Jews  are forbidden to eat Swines Flesh what then should they do with Swine which are good for nothing till they are dead who eat neither Pigg Pork nor Bacon Some may say that they were kept there for the Use of Strangers But this could not be because that after the Time of  Antiochus  who polluted the Temple with the Sacrifice of an Hog the  Jews  Spencer de Legibus Hebraep  forbid under the Pain of an  Anathema  the keeping of any Swine in their Country Perhaps is may be said that  the  Gadarens  so call'd from the Place of their Abode were not  Jews  but neighbouring  Gentiles  with whom it was lawful to eat and keep  Swine  We will suppose so tho' it is improbable but then it's unlikely without better Reason than at present we are apprised of that our Saviour would permit the Devils to enter into a Herd of them to their Destruction Where was the Goodness and Justice of his so doing Let our  Divines  account for it if they can It is commonly said of our Saviour and I believe it that his Life was entirely Innocent that his Miracles were all useful and beneficial to Maniind and that he did no Wrong to any one But how can this be rightly said of him if this Story be litterally true The Proprietors of the Swine were great Losers and Sufferers and we don't read that  Jesus  make them amends or that they deserv'd such Usage from him The Proprietors of the Swine it seems upon this Damage done them by  Jesus  desire him to depart out of their Coasts to prevent farther Mischief which was gentler Resentment than we can imagine any others would have made of the like Injury I know not what our Divines think of this Part of the Story nor wherefore Jesus escaped so well but if any  Exorcist  in this our Age and Nation had pretended to expel  the Devil out of one possess'd and permitted him to enter into a Flock of Sheep the People would have said that he had bewitch'd both and our Laws and Judges too of the last Age would have made him to swing for it  Without Offence I hope I have argued against the Letter of this strange Story of the Holy Jesus I should not have dared to have said so much against it but upon the Encouragement of  Origen  and other Fathers who say we ought to expose the Absurdities of the Letter as much as may be to turn Men's Heads to the mystical and true meaning  Let's hear then what the Fathers say to this Miracle  Origen  's Commentaries on this Part of St  Matthew  and St  Luke  's Gospel are lost otherwise unquestionably he would not only have told us that he believed no more of the Letter of this Story than he did of the Devil's  L IV  De Principiis  taking our Saviour to the Top of a Mountain and shewing him all the Kingdoms of the World but as he is an admirable  Mystist  would have given us curious Light into the Allegory and Mystery of it But without  Origen  we have enough in the other Fathers against the Letter of this Story  St  Hilary  reckoning up all the Parts of this Miracle together says of it that it is  Hanc habeant Causam ut esset in rebus gerendis futuri plena meditatio  In Loc  Matt In hoc Typica ratio servata est  Ibid  Typical and Parabolical and written for our Meditation of what would be done hereafter by the Holy  Jesus  According to him and other Fathers the  Madman  is Mankind or if they were two they were  Jew  and  Gentile  at Christ's coming who may be said to  Significatae sunt gentes quae multis daemonibus serviebant  Augustin in Luc Quaest    be  possess'd with Devils  in as much as they were under the Rule of diabolical Sins and subject to the Worship of  false Deities which we translate  Devils  They were  so fierce  Humanum genus ad Adventum Domini vexabatur furore dementi rumpens vincula rationis St  Amb in Loc Luc  as no Chains could hold them  because of their most furious Rage and Enmity to the Church whom no Bonds of Reason could restrain from doing Violence to the Christians They are said  to be  Nudus quicunque tegumentum Naturae suae Virtutis amisit  Amb Ibid  naked  because they were destitute of the Clothing of the Spirit and of Grace And  may be said to be  among the  In tumulis Sepulchrorum quid enim aliud sunt Corpora perfidorum nisi quaedam defunctorum Sepulchra in quibus Dei verbum non habitat  Ibid  Tombs  because they were dead in Trespasses and Sins After that  Jesus  had exorcis'd these diabolical Spirits out of the  Gentiles  and brought them to their right Senses which was upon their Conversion to the Faith then a  good Way off  some Ages after did the like  Devils  by Divine Permission enter into a  Videntes Daemones non sibi jam locum in gentibus derelinqui ut patiatur habitare se in Haereticis deprecantur  Hilar in Loc  Matt  Herd of Swine  i e into  Hereticks  of impure Lives and furious Natures What sort of  Hereticks  are meant or whether they are not to be understood of Christians in general let our  Divines  consider But one would be apt to think that  Ministers of the Letter  are included  Littera est Palea frequenter evenit ut homines hujus soeculi mystica nescientes simplici Scripturarum Lectione pascuntur  Hieron in  Isa c xi  because the  Letter  of the Scripture is mystically call'd  Swines  Food I am not obliged to pursue the mystical Interpretation of this Parable for so I will call it thro' all its Parts nor to say what is meant by the Sea that the  Swine  are to be absorp't in But leave our  Divines  to chew upon this mystical Construction given them in  part and to consider whether there's not a Necessity for such an Interpretation to make the Story credible  And thus have I given you the Opinion and Exposition of the Fathers upon this Miracle which they turn all into Mystery If our  Divines  are still for adhering to the Letter of this Story let them Account for the Difficulties it is involv'd with To cure Men violently distracted and possess'd with  Devils  is whether it be miraculous or not a good and great Work but to send the  Devils  who without  Jesus  's Permission could not go into the  Herd of Swine  was an Injury done to the Proprietors and unbecoming of the Goodness of the Holy Jesus Neither is there any other Way to solve the Difficulty than by looking upon the Whole with the Fathers as Type and Figure  If this Miraculous Story had been recorded of  Mahomet  and not of  Jesus  our  Divines  I dare say would have work'd it up to a Confutation of  Mahometanism Mahomet  should have been with them nothing less than a Wizard an Enchanter a dealer with familiar Spirits a sworn slave to the Devil and his  Mussulmen  would have been hard put to it to write a good Defence of him  When our Saviour was brought before  Pilate  to be arraign'd try'd and condem'd  Pilate  put this Question to the  Jews  saying  what evil hath Jesus done  If both or either of the Stories above had been litterally true of  Jesus  there had been no need of false Witnesses against him The Merchants of the Temple were at hand who could have sworn "that he was the Author of an Uproar and Riot the like was never seen on their Marketday that they were great Sufferers and Losers in their Trades and whether he or his Party had stolen any of their Goods or not yet some were embezzled and others damag'd and all through the outragious Violence of this unruly Fellow against Law and Authority" If such Evidence as this was not enough to convict him of a Capital Crime then the  SwineHerds  of the  Gadarenes  might have deposed how they "believed him to be a  Wizard  and had lost two thousand Swine through his Falcinations That he bid the Divels to go into our Cattle is not to be deny'd And if he cured one or two of our Countrymen of a violent Possession yet in as much as he did us this Injury in our Swine we justly suspect him of Diabolical Practises upon both"  Upon such Evidence as this  Pilate  asks the Opinion of Jews saying  what think you  If they all had condemn'd him to be guilty of Death it is no wonder since there is not a  Jury  in  England  would have acquitted any one arraign'd and Accused in the like Case  It is well for our litteral  Doctors  that such Accusations were not brought against  Jesus  or their Heads would have been sadly puzzled to vindicate his Innocence and to prove the Injustice and Undeservedness of his Death and Sufferings But for this Reason if no other that no such Crimes were laid to his Charge I believe little or nothing of either of the seemingly miraculous Storys before us but look upon them both as Prophetical and Parabolical Narratives of what would mysteriously and more wonderfully and consistently with the Wisdom and Goodness of  Jesus  be done by him And so I pass to a  Third Miracle of Jesus and that is  his Transfiguration  Matt C xvii Mark C ix Luke C ix  on the Mount  And this is the darkest and blindest Story of the whole Gospel which a Man can make neither Head nor Foot of and I question whether the Conceptions of any two thinking  Doctors  do agree about it To say  there is nothing in the Letter of this Story we Believers must not because St  Peter  ii Peter Cap i v  says he was an Eyewitness of  Jesus  's Majesty saw his Glory on the Mount and heard the Voice out of the Cloud But as Infidels will be prying into the Conduct of  Jesus  's Life and forming their Exceptions to the Credibility or Probability of this or that Part of it so we Christians should be ready at an Answer that might reasonably satisfy them and not forcibly bear down their Opposition which will make no sincere Converts of them And I believe they would easily distress us with Difficultys and Objections to the Letter of this Story  St  Augustin  himself  Possunt Infideles istam Vocem delatam de Caelo per conjecturas humanas et illicitas Curiositates ad magicas Artes referre  In Sermon  xliii  sect    owns that the whole of it might be perform'd by Magic Art And we know in these our Days that some Jugglers are strange Artists at the imitation of a Voice and to make it as if it came from a far of when it is uttered close by us and can cast themselves too into different forms and shapes without a Miracle to the Surprise and Admiration of spectators  But what I trow do our  Divines  mean by  Jesus  's  Transfiguration  We read that  his Countenance did shine like the Sun and his Rayment was made as white as Snow and that's all And is this enough can we think to demonstrate that Transaction a Miraclous  Transfiguration  Phylosophers will tell us that the Reflections of the Light of the Sun will change the Appearance of Colours and to none more than whiteness And  Sceptics  will say that its no wonder if the Countenance of Jesus look'd  Rubicund  when the Sun might shine on it  The Word in the Original for transfigured is  that is he was metamorphosed transform'd or if you will transfigured And what is to be understood by a  Metamorphosis  we are to learn not only from the natural Import of the Word but from the ancient use of it Accordingly it signifies nothing less than the Change or Transformation of a Person into the Forms Shapes and Essences of Creatures and Things of a quite different Species Size and Figure But  Jesus  it is conceived was not so  transfigured  Our Divines I suppose would not have him thought such a  PostureMaster  for the whole World If I or any one else should assert that Jesus upon the Mount transform'd himself into a Calf a Lyon a Bear a Ram a Goat an Hydra a Stone a Tree and into many  other things of the animate and inanimate World I dare say there would among our Orthodox Divines be such Exclamations against me for Blasphemy as the like were never heard of They to be sure will not hear of such a Transfiguration nor like good plain Believers will bear any thing more than that Jesus's  Countenance did shine  like the Sun and the Colour of his Countenance was changed which whether it comes up to the import of a  Metamorphosis  or not they dont care  But to close with our Divines and acknowledge that the glorious Change of  Jesus  's Countenance and of the Colour of his Vestments was a true and proper Transsiguration and that it was as real and wonderful a Miracle as could be wrought But then we may I hope ask them what was the particular Reason and Use of this Miracle Was it a Miracle only for the sake of a Miracle That's an Absurdity in the Opinion of  Neque enim Miracula propter Miracula faci  sed  illa quae faciebat miraessent videntibus vera essent intelligentibus  In Serm  xcviii  Sect    St  Augustin  who says what is reasonable to think that all and every one of Jesus's Miracles had its particular End and Use or he who is the Wisdom as well as Power of God had never wrought it And what I pray was the  Use of this Miracle Of that the Evangelical History is silent and our Divines with all their Reasoning Facultys can say nothing to it  And what did  Moses  and  Elias  on the Mount with Jesus was it in their own proper Persons that they appear'd or were they only some Specters and Apparitions in Resemblance of them It is said that they were talking with  Jesus  what then did they talk about The three greatest Prophets and Philosophers of the Universe could not possibly meet and confer together but on the most sublime useful and edifying Subject It's strange that the Apostles who overheard their Confabulation did not make a Report of it and transmit it to Posterity for our Edification and Instruction St  Luke  as our  English  Translation has it seems to say that they talk'd together of Jesus's  Decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem  but this can't be the meaning of St  Luke  's  C ix V    Words which so interpreted are no less than a  Barbarism  and I appeal to our Greek Critics an improper Expression of such signification We must then look for a more proper Construction of the Phrase in St  Luke  or we must remain  in the dark as to the Subject that  Moses  and  Elias  talked with Jesus about  But further why could not this Miracle have been wrought in the Valley as well as upon a Mountain whither Jesus and his three Apostles ascended for the Work of it Naughty Infidels will say it was for the Advantage of a Cloud which often moves and rests on the Tops of Mountains to display his Pranks in And why was it not done in the Presence of the Multitude as well as of his three Apustles The more Witnesses of a Miracle the better it is attested and the more reasonably Credited and there could not surely be too many Witnesses of this any more than of others of  Jesus  's Miracles if real ones Ought not the unbelieving Multitude for many Unbelievers unquestionably were amongst them to have had a Sight and Hearing of this Miracle as well as the Apostles Who should rather see the Miracle than those who wanted Conviction Were they to take the Report of the Miracle upon the Word of the Apostles who were Partys in the Cause Our Divines may possibly say they ought But Infidels and Free Thinkers would cry out against them for juggling Tricks and pious Impostures  These are all Difficultys and hard Questions about the Miracle of Christ's Transfiguration which our  Clergy  who are Admirers of the Letter of that Story are obliged to Account for and I believe it will be long enough before they give a proper and satisfactory Answer to many of them  Let's hear then what the Fathers say to this miraculous Story of Jesus's Transfiguration And it is agreed amongst them that the whole is but a Type  Regni coelestis Honor praefiguratur St  Hilar in Loc  Matt In Transfiguratione futura Regni Praemeditatio Gloria demonstrata est St  Hierom in Loc  Matt  Prefiguration and  Anaft in Transfig Dom  St  Chrysist in Loc  Matt  Aenigmatical Resemblance of a future and more glorious and real Transfiguration And whenever they speak of any Part of the Story they never explain to us how the Matter went upon Mount  Tabor  but tell us of what this or that Part of it is Figurative and Emblematical and how it is to be understood and will be fulfill'd in future Time As thus by  the  Sex millium scilicet Annorum Temporibus evolutis St  Hilar in Loc  Matt Sic post Sex aetates Dominus a perfectis Famulis conspicietur  Dionys Alex apud Damascen in Orat de Transfig  Six Days    they understand six Ages of the World after which a real and mysterious Transfiguration will be exhibited to our intellectual Views By  Moses  and  Elias  Et Moses Elias apparuerunt in Gloria cum Jesu colloquentes in quo ostenditur Legem Prophetas cum Evangeliis consonare in eadem Gloria spiritualis intelligentiae refulgere  Origen in Epist ad  Rom c  talking with  Jesus  they mean the Law and the Prophets upon an Allegorical Interpretation bearing Testimony unto Christ as the Fulfiller of them By the  Montem ascendit ut te doceat ne quaeras eum nisi in Legem Prophetarum montibus  Origen in Cantic Cantic Hom    Mountain  on which this future Transfiguration will be exhibited they understand the sublime and anagogical Sense of the Law and the Prophets By his Transfiguration it self they mean his taking upon him and passing through the Forms of all the Types of him under the Law as of a Lamb a Lion a Serpent a Calf a Rock a Stone and of many others which he is to fulfil and which will then be clearly discern'd by us By the black Cloud  Per nubem tetram intellige opacitatem Legis  Damascen in Orat de Transfigur  that at present obstructs this Vision they understand the Letter of the Old Testament By the  white  Vestimenta candida Jesu sunt Sermones Scripta Evangeliorum  Origen in Loc  Matt  Vestments of Jesus they mean the Words of the Scriptures which will then shine clear and bright By the Voice out of the Cloud they mean with St  Peter  the Word of Prophecy that will sound in the Ears of our Apprehensions And lastly they tell us that the Way to attain to the Sight of this glorious Vision is by ascending not by local Motion but by Reason to the Tops of the Mountain of the mysterious and sublime Sense of the Law and the Prophets If we continue in the Plains and Valley  Si quis Litteram sequitur deorsum est totus hic non potest videre Jesum in veste candida qui autem sequitur Sermonem Dei ad montana id est excelsa Legis conscendit isti Jesus commutaturQuamdiu Litteram sequimur occidentem Moses Elias cum Jesu non loquuntur sin spiritualiter intelligimus statim Moses Elias veniunt id est Lex Prophetae colloquuntur cum Evangelie  Johan Hieros Hom    of the Letter like the Multitude under the Mountain we shall never see Jesus in his shining Vestments nor how he was transform'd into the Types of the Law nor  Moses  and  Elias  talking with him not the Law and the Prophets agreeing harmoniously in a Testimony to him  After this Fashion do the Fathers one or other of them Copiously Treat on every  Part of this Transfiguration of Jesus I could collect an almost infinite Number of Passages out of their Writings to this Purpose But from these few it is plain they look'd on the Story of Christ's Transfiguration but as a Figure and Parable and they were certainly in the right on't in as much as this their Sense of the Matter and no other will solve the Difficultys before started against the Letter as any one may discern if he attentively review and compare one with the other As for Instance this their Sense and Interpretation lets us into the Reason of  Moses  and  Elias's  appearing on the Mount with Jesus and gives us to understand what they talk'd about and that was not on Jesus's  Decease which he would accomplish at Jerusalem  as our Translation has it but on the Prophecy of the old Testament particularly as St  Luke  says on Mose's  Book of Exodus    and how he would fulfill it  at the New Jerusalem  Whether any besides my self do's really apprehended and is willing to understand this Story of Christ's Transfiguration as I do I neither know nor care I am not bound to find others Ears Eyes and Capacitys What I have said is enough to shew the Sense of the Fathers about this Matter If any dislike their concurrent Opinions of Jesus's Transfiguraton's  being an Emblem an Enigma and Figurative Representation of a Future and most Glorious Transfiguration such a one as they speak of let him account for the Difficultys and Objections which I have before raised against the Letter of this Story In the mean Time I shall think it litterally an absurd improbable and incredible one and no other than a Prophetical and Parabolical Narrative of what will be Mysteriously and more wonderfully done by  Jesus  And thus I have consider'd Three of the Miracles of our Saviour and shewn how they are Absurdities according to the Letter consequently do make nothing for his Authority and Messiahship I can and will do as much by his other Miracles for I would not have any one think I am gotten to the End of my Tedder but for some Reasons best known to my self I publish these Remarks on these three first After the Clergy have chew'd upon these a while I will take into Examination some others of  Jesus's  Miracles which for their litteral Story are admired by them As for Instance I will take to task his Miracle  John Cap ii  of changing Water into Wine at a Marriage in Cana of Galilee  which was the beginning of  Jesus's  Miracles and should by right have been first spoken to but I am almost too  grave to handle the Letter of this Story as I ought and if I had treated it as ludicrously as it deserves I don't know but at setting out I should have put the  Clergy  quite out of all Temper I would not now for the World be so impious and prophane as to believe with out  Divines  what is contain'd and imply'd in the Letter of this Story If  Apollonius Tyanaeus  and not  Jesus  had been the Author of this Miracle we should often have reproached his Memory with it It is said of  Apollonius Tyanaeus  that a Table was all on a sudden at his Command miraculously spread with variety of nice Dishes for the Entertainment of himself and his Guests which Miracle our  Divines  can tell him makes not at all to his Credit in as much as it was done for the service and pleasure of luxurious Appetites But if  Apollonius  had done as our  Jesus  did at this Wedding they would have said much worse of him and that modestly speaking he delighted to make his Friends thoroughly merry or he would not be at the Pains of a Miracle to turn so much Water into Wine after they had before  well drank  If the Fathers then don't help us out at the mystical and true meaning of this Miracle such farther Objections may be form'd against the Letter as may make our Divines asham'd of it  I will also take into Examination  Jesus's  Miracles  Matt c xiv and xv c  of  feeding many thousands in the Wilderness with a few Loaves and Fishes  which according to the Letter are most tomantick Tales I don't in the least question  Jesus's  Power to magnifie or multiply the Loaves and if he pleas'd to meliorate the Bread But that many thousands of Men Women and Children should follow him into the Wilderness and stay with him three Days and Nights too without eating is a little against Sense and Reason Whether the Wilderness was near to or far from the Peoples Habitations the difficultys attending the Story are equally great I wonder how  Jesus  amused them all the while that they had the Patience to stay with him without Food But I much more wonder that no Victualers besides the  Lad  with his Loaves and Fishes of whom and his Occupation whether it was that of a  Baker  or  Fishmonger  and of his neglect of his Master's Business here and of the Reason that he met with no hungry Chapmen for his Bread before we shall make some Enquiry but particurly why he alone I say and no other Victualers no other Retalers of Cakes and Gingerbread followed the Camp In short for all the imaginary greatness of the Miracle which there is a  way to reduce and lessen of Jesus's feeding his thousands with a few Loaves there must be some Fascination or Enchantment condemn'd by the Laws of the  Jews  as well as of other Nations in the Matter or the People if they had stay'd one Day would not two much less three  to faint  but would especially the Women and Children have been for returning the first Night home We must then seek to the Fathers who say the five Books of  Moses  are the five Barley Loaves  c  and the septiform'd Spirit the seven Loaves  c  for a good Notion of this Miracle and if they don't make it a Parable do what our Divines can it will turn to the dishonour of the Holy Jesus  I will also consider the Miracle of Jesus's  Mark Cap ii Luke C v  curing the Man sick of the Palsy for whom the Roof of the House was broken up to let him down into the Room where Jesus was because his Bearers could not enter in at the Door for the Press of the People  This Litterally is such a  Rodomontado  that were Men to stretch for a wager against Reason and Truth none could outdoe it Where was the Humanity of the People and wherefore did they so tumultuate against the Door of the House It's  strange  they had not so much Compassion on the  Paralytick  as to give Way to him  It's  more strange  that his Bearers could get to the Top of the House with him and his Bed too when they could not get to the Door nor the Sides of it It's  yet stranger  that the good Man of the House would suffer his House to be broken up when it could not be long 'ere the Tumult of the People would be appeas'd But most  strange  that  Jesus  who could drive his thousands out of the Temple before him and draw as many after him into the Wilderness did not by Force or Perswasion make the People to retreat but that such needless Trouble and Pains must be taken for the miraculous Cure of this poor Man Let's think of these Things against the Time that out of the Fathers I prove this Story to be a Parable  I will also take into Consideration the Miracle of  Jesus's  curing  the  John Cap ix  Blind Man    for whom EyeSalve was made of Clay and Spittle  which EyeSalve whether it was balsamick or not do's equally affect the Credit of the Miracle If it was naturally medicinal there's an End of the Miracle and if it was not at all medicinal it was foolishly and impertinently apply'd and can be no otherwise accounted for than by considering it with the Fathers as a figurative Act in Jesus  I will also take into Consideration the several Stories of  Jesus  's raising of the dead and without questioning his actual bringing of the Dead to Life again will prove from the Circumstances of those Storys that they are parabotical and are not litterally to be apply'd to the Proof of Jesus  's  Divine Authority and Messiahship or for Instance  Jesus  when he raised  Jarius's  Mark Cap v  Daughter from the dead would never have turned the People out of the House who should have been his best and properest Witnesses  I will also Consider the Miracle of Jesus'  s  Matt Cap xxi Mark Cap xi  Cursing the FigTree  for its not bearing Fruit out of Season which upon the bare mention of it appears to be a foolish absurd and ridiculous Act if not figurative  I will also consider the  Matt Cap ii  Journey of the Wisemen out of the East with their litterally senseless and ridiculous Presents of  Frankincence  and  Myrrhe  to a newborn Babe If with their  Gold  which could be but little they had brought their Dozens of Sugar Soap and Candles which would have been of use to the Child and his poor Mother in the Straw they had acted like wise as well as good Men But what I  pray was the Meaning and Reason of a Star like a  Will a Whisp  for their Guide to the Place where the Holy Infant lay Could not God by Divine Impulse in a Vision or in a Dream as he ordered their Return Home have sent them on this important Errand but that a Star must be taken or made out of Course to this Purpose I wonder what Communication passed between these Wise Men and the Star or how they came to know one another's Use and Intention But the Fathers shall speak hereafter farther to the senselesness of this Story litterally and make out the Mystery and true meaning of it  I will also by the Leave of our  Divines  take again into Consideration the miraculous Conception of the Virgin  Mary  and the Resurrection of  Jesus  from the Dead I do believe if it may so please our  Divines  that  Jesus  was born of a pure Virgin and that he arose from the Dead but speaking too briefly in the  Moderator  to these two Miracles they took Offence I will therefore give them a Review and speak Home to them particularly to Christ's Resurrection the Evangelical Story of which litterally is such a Complication of Absurditys Incoherences and Contradictions that unless the Fathers can help us to a better  Understanding of the  Evangelists  than we have at present we must of Necessity give up the Belief of it  These and many  Alia quam plurima his similia in Evangeliis inveniet quicunque attentius legerit  Origen de Principiis  L iv  other of the historical and miraculous Parts of Jesus's Life will I take into Examination and shew that none of them litterally do prove his Divine Authority so far from it that they are full of Absurdities Improbabilities and Incredibilities but that his whole Life in the Flesh is but  Quae Enarratio erit Evangelii sensibilis nisi accommodetur ad intelligibile spirituale Nulla sane  Origen in Praefat ad Johan Evang  Type Figure and Parable of his mysterious and spiritual Life and Operations in Mankind  In the end of this Head it will be a curious and diverting Subject to examine the Miracles of Jesus as they are litterally understood by the Notions which our  Divines  have advanced about Miracles and to shew that even their Notions compared with Christ's Miracles are destructive of his Authority and subversive of Christianity This I say would be a most diverting Undertaking and it will be strange if some  FreeThinker  that loves Pleasure of this kind do's not take  the hint and snatch the Work out of my Hands If I do it ray self I shall have especial regard to the Writers against the  Grounds  without passing by Mr  Chandler  's Essay on Miracles on which the more Remarks will be made if it be but to pay my Respects to the  Arch Bishop  's Judgment and to shew my Admiration at those extravagant Praises which his  Grace  at  Lambeth  has bestow'd on that Author Among other his notable Notions of a Miracle and the  ArchBishop  says he has  See ArchBishop  Wake  's Manuscript Letter to Mr  Chandler  which is handed about Town and Country  set the Notion of a Miracle upon a clear and sure Foundation  one is  Chandler'  s Vindication  c Page  That Miracles should be Things probable as well us possible that they do not carry along with them the Appearance of Romance and Fable which would unavoidably prejudice Men against believing them  This is certainly a good and right Notion of a Divine Miracle and I don't doubt but according to it Mr  Chandler  and the  ArchBishop  think they can justifie the litteral Story of our Saviour's Miracles against the Charge of  Fable  and  Romance  But whether they are able to do it or not I shall go on in some Discourses hereafter to be publish'd  to prove that our  Divines  by espousing the Letter of Christ's Miracles have deceived themselves into the Belief of the most arrant  Quixotism  that can be devised and palm'd upon the Understandings of Mankind I say they have deceived themselves for neither the Fathers nor the Apostles nor even  Jesus  himself meant that his Miracles as recorded in the  Evangelists  should be taken in a litteral Sense but in  Dominus noster ea quae faciebat corporaliter etiam spiritualiter volebat intelligi  c August Serm  xcviii Sect  a mystical figurative and parabolical One And this should bring me to the  III Head of my Discourse that is to consider what  Jesus  means when he appeals to his Works and Miracles as to a Witness and Testimony of his Divine Authority and to shew that he could not properly and truly refer to those supposed to be wrought by him in the  Flesh  but to those mystical Ones he would do in the  Spirit  of which those seemingly wrought by him in the Flesh are but Types and Shadows  But this Head can't be rightly spoken to till I have more amply discuss'd the Former which by God's leave I Promise to do  And if my  Curteous Readers  will be so kind as to trust me till that Time I assure them to prove that no Ignorance and Stupidity can be greater than the Imagination that  Jesus  really appeal'd to his Miracles supposed to have been wrought by him in the Flesh as to a Witness and Testimony of his Divine Authority and Messiahship  In the mean Time our Divines may go on in their own Way if they think fit and admire  Jesus  of old and celebrate his Power and Praises for healing of bodily Diseases and doing other notable Feats according to the Letter of the Evangelical Story but I am for the spirirual  Jesus  and  Messiah  who cures the worse  Quos in corporibus morbos sanavit Christus hi in animabus existunt supernam ejus opem requirunt  Johan Nepot Hieros  Hom LXI  Distempers of the Soul and do's other mysterious and most miraculous Works of which those recorded in the Evangelists are but Figure and Parable This is the Primitive and concurrent Opinion about the true Messiah which the Fathers universally adher'd to Whether our  Jesus  at this Day be such a spiritual  Messiah  to his Church or whether she do's not stand in need of such a one is the Question that our Divines are to see to But I will add here  what I believe and shall have another Opportunity to prove that God on purpose suffer'd or empower'd  false  as well as  true  Prophets  bad  as well us  good  Men such as  Apollonius    Vespasian  and many others to cure Diseases and to do other mighty Works equal to what are literally reported of  Jesus  not only to defeat us of all Distinction between true and false Miracles which are the Object of our bodily Senses but to raise and keep up our Thoughts to the constant Contemplation of  Jesus  's spiritual mysterious and most miraculous Works which are the Object of our Understandings and loudly bespeak the Power Wisdom and Goodness of God and which are to be the absolute Demonstration of  Jesus  's Divine Authority and Messiahship to the Conversion of  Jews  and  Infidels  I have no more to do at present but like a  Moderator  to conclude with a short Address and Exhortation to  Infidels  and  Apostates  the two contending Partys in the present Controversy And  First  To  Apostates  I mean the Writers against the  Grounds  and  Scheme  Whether you  Grave Sirs  who account your selves Orthodox  Divines  tho' there is little but Contradiction and Inconsistency amongst you do like the Name of  Apostates  which  is given you I much Question But it is the properest I could think of for your Desertion of Primitive Doctrine about Prophecy and Miracles I could not improperly have given you a worse  Title  but I was willing to Compliment you rather than Reproach you wish this  But setting aside the Title of  Apostates  whether it be in your Opinion opprobious or not you may plainly perceive that I am  Sirs  on your side as to the Truth of Christianity and if you'll accept of my Assistance for the Proof of  Jesus  's Messiahship from Prophecy upon the Terms of the Allegorical Scheme proposed in my  Moderator  you shall find me your hearty Abettor Upon the Allegorical Scheme I don't doubt but we shall soundly drub and maul  Infidels  and beat them out of the Field of Battle If you being wedded to the litteral Scheme will not accept of my Assistance you may go on in your own Way and see the Event of the Controversy which in the End will turn to your Dishonour  You  Sirs  can't but be sensible how those two great Generals Mr  Grounds  and Mr  Scheme  with their potent Armies of Reasons and Authorities against your litteral Prophecies have greivously distress'd and gall'd you and if you don't make an  honourable Retreat in Time and seek to  Allegorists  for help will gain a compleat Victory and Triumph over you  Instead of the help of  Allegorists  you I find under the Disappointment of your litteral Scheme chuse rather to have Recourse to  Jesus  's Miracles But what little Dependance there is upon his Miracles in your Sense I have in  Part  proved in this Discourse and this I have done give me leave repeatedly to declare it not for the Service of your unbelieving Adversaries but to reduce you to the good old Way of interpreting Oracles which upon the Testimony of the Fathers will one Day be the Conversion of the  Jews  and  Gentiles  Whether you  Sirs  will be pleas'd with this short Discourse on Christ's Miracles I much Question But before you put your selves into a Rage against it I beg of you to read St  Theophilus  of  Antioch    Origen  St  Hilary  St  Augustin  St  Ambrose  St  Jerome  St  Chrysostom  St  John  of  Jerusalem  St  Theophylact  and other occasional ancient Pieces on one Part or other of the  Evangelists  and you'll find how they countenance such a Discourse as this on Miracles and will abundantly assist me in the Prosecution of it  I expect  Sirs  that some of you will be ready to rave against me for this Discourse  but this is my Comfort that if your Passion should arise to another Prosecution of me you can't possibly seperate any of mine from the Opinions of the Fathers to ground a Prosecution on And what Dishonor in the End will redown to Protestant and pretendedly learned  Divines  of the Church of  England  to persecute again the Fathers for primitive Doctrine I desire you to think on  But as I suppose you'll have more Wit  Sirs  than to prosecute me again for this Discourse so I hope you'll have more Ingenuity than odiously after your wonted manner to represent me to the Populace for Profaneness Blasphemy and Infedelity If you dislike the whole or any Part of this Discourse appear like Men and Scholars from the  Press  against it Use me as roughly in Print as you think fit I'll not take it ill  Veniam petimus dabimus{que} vicissim  I desire nothing more than to be furiously attack'd from the  Press  which if I am not much mistaken would give me a long'd for opportunity to expose your Ignorance to more Advantage  Be not longer mistaken  Good Sirs  The History of  Jesus's  Life as recorded in the  Evangelists  is an emblematical Representation of his Spiritual Life in the Soul of Man and his Miracles are Figures of his mysterious Operations The four Gospels are in no Part a litteral Story but a System of mystical Phylosophy or Theology  If you are resolv'd not to come into this Opinion I beg of you again before you break forth into a Passion to try to viudicate the litteral Story of the three Miracles spoken to in this Discourse  viz  those of Jesus's  driving the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple of his exorcising the Devil out of the Madman and of his Transfiguration on the Mount  which if you are able to defend against the Fathers and my Objections I'll give up the Cause to you and own my self what I am sarr enough from being an impious Insidel and Blasphemer and deserving of the worst Punishment In the mean time I make bold again to assert that the litteral Story of Christ' Life and Miracles is an absurd and incredible Romance full of Contradictions and Inconsistencys and that modern Paraphrases are not only a consequential Reflection on the Intellects of the  Evangelists  and their Divine Gifts of the Spirit as if they could not write an intelligible and coherent Piece of Biography without your Help at this Distance of Time but have  are like an  highmettal'd blind Horse  that were they not ridden by the Civil Authority with a strait Rein would be oppressing and trampling upon all that stood in the Way of their Interests to the Disturbance of  Civil Society  Profaneness  to do's the  Bishop  charge me with But why so Because I ridicule the Nonsense and Absurditys of  Jesus  's Miracles according to the Letter which he venerates Very fine indeed The  Bishop  would worship the  Head  of an  Ass  and a wiser Man than himself without the Charge of Profaneness must not laugh at his foolish Superstition  And  Blasphemy  lastly does the  Bishop  accuse me of And this is a sad  Bugbear  Word that has frighted Abundance of People into dreadful Apprehensions of my Guilt even to the Abhorrence of me But the  Bishop  should first have defined what is meant by  Blasphemy  and have proved one guilty of it before he made his Exclamations Or the  Turks  may say that a Jest upon their  Alcoran  in which there are no Contradictions is as much a  Blasphemy  as any Ludicrousness upon the  Gospels  which are full of Inconsistencies That there is such a Sin or Error call'd  Blasphemy  according to the Scriptures is certain But our  Divines  are undetermined  about the Nature of it I intend to take my Opportunity to treat on the Sin of Blasphemy and to prove  Ministers  of the  Letter  are the only Persons that can be guilty of it  Ministers  of the  Letter  upon the Authority of the Fathers are the Worshippers of the  Apocalyptical Beast  and antiallegorical Expositions are that Blasphemy St  John  writes of which the  Beast  and his Worshippers will open their Mouths in against the most High This shall be proved as clear as the Light But when I do it I would not have any think it is with an Intention to bring the Bishops of  London    Litchfield  and St  Davids  or any other  Divines  under Prosecution for that heinous Sin No my God is omnipotent omniscient and omnipresent and knows how and when to reckon with such Blasphemers without calling upon the civil Magistrate to do it for him Should I importune the Civil Authority to execute Vengeance upon them▪ I should make a foolish  Calf  or a Sense+less  Idol  of my God that was unable or knew not how nor when to vindicate his own Cause Surely the  Bisho  of  London  upon his Prosecution of  for Blasphemy must think his God  asleep  or  gone a Journey  from Home  he would not be for taking God's  Work out of his Hands and committing it to the Care of the Civil Magistrate  The  Bishop  moreover should consider that the Words  profane  and  blasphemous  are of no use and significaiton among Philosophers who in Disputation never cast them at each other however they may differ in Opinion Philosophers are all supposed to be such profound Venerators of the Deity as they would not be guilty of  Profaneness  and  Blasphemy  for the whole World If any of our School of  FreeThinkers  should say of his Opponent that he's  profane  and  blasphemous  he would be reprimanded for want of Wit Temper and good Manners and be told that he's like a  Billing sgate Scold  who had Recourse to impertinent bad Language when her Reason fails her for better Rhetorick  But it may be for ought I know the  Bishop  has some Design in his Accusations against me for  Profaneness  and  Blasphemy  but I hope it is a better than to prejudice the Civil Magistrate or to incense the Populace  According to the Fathers I am so far from being a Blasphemer that they say  Christ  upon the litteral interpretation of his Miracles is metamorphosed into the falseChrist call'd  AntiChrist  Whether there  is any Truth in this their Opinion I can't be positive till the Experiment is fully made But if our  Clergy  will keep their Temper and grant me a clear Stage of Battle I'll try it out and see whether I I can't by the Club of Reason and primitive Authority give their  AntiChrist  a fatal Blow Who knows but I may give Peace to the Church and reconcile all Partys by it  However this may be I am sure no Man can wish for a greater Advantage over his Enemy than I have over the  Bishop  in this Controversy But he shall find me a generous Adversary who will make no worse use of my Advantage over him than now and then to put him in Mind of his  Pastoral Letter  and of the Prosecution unless I should be tempted ere long to publish my  Moderatorial  Letter like his  Pastoral  one to the People of  London  and  Westminster  with  Ten  wholesome Rules in it not only to caution them against false Prophets and false Teachers without forgetting the  Bishop  of the  Diocese  but to direct them to the Ecclesiastical Fountain of the growing Sins Errors and Infidelity of the Age which the  Clergy  know I am of Ability to lay open  When I began the Publication of these  Discourses  I own I laid a  Trap  for some considerable  Clergyman  but little imagined the great  Bishop  of  London  would be caught in it But now I have taken hold of him I'll not release him out of the Controversy till he has sorely repented of his Ignorance or Malice in calling me a  Writer    in Favour of Infidelity  So much at present for the Bishop of  London  I have been the quicker of late in the printing of  this  because I am given to understand the  Bishop  of St  Davids  stays for it intending to make but one Work of it and answer all  six Discourses  together I hope my  Rabbi  's Letter here will be thought by him a good Payment for his Patience And now I shall be in Expectation of his Mountainous Production and where I shall hide myself from the terrible Strokes of his Pen I have not as yet consider'd  I am not a little pleas'd to see a  Couple  of Dissenting Preachers  viz  Dr  Harris  and Mr  Atkinson  listed into the Controversy against me If they had kept their Necks out of the Collar they might have dissembled and pretended that upon the Conclusion of the Battle when it would have appear'd I am a real Contender for  Primitive Christianity they had a better Understanding of the Fathers and a clearer View of my Design than to suspect me of Blasphemy and Infidelity But now they are engaged with equal Spite Ignorance and Defamations against me they must take their share of the Fate and Shame with the  Clergy  upon the Conclusion of the Controversy  There's no Body can think it worth my while to bestow a Sixpenny  Pamphlet  upon either of these  Gentlemen  but for all that they shall not be altogether slighted and neglected by me I have made a Collection of their Rhetorical Flowers which occasionally shall be presented to the Publick to the Admiration of their Wit Reason Learning and Eloquence And at present only take Notice that they are  both  for the Persecution of me but not so much for my Opinions as the Indecency Irreverence and Immorality of my Stile forfooth which is such a Distinction as may be easily Stretch'd to the Justification of the Persecution of all Authors whom the Priesthood in Power shall not like Mr  Atkinson's  Argument for the Presecution of me is much the same with that which  John Calvin  used for the Persecution of that great Philosopher  Servetus  the Injustice and Cruelty of  whose death and sufferings is a greater Reproach to the Name of  Calvin  than the Martyrdom of any  Protestant  can be to the Memory of any Popish Prelate  To conclude what I have written in these  Six Discourses  is with a View to the Glory of God the Advancement of Truth the Happiness of Mankind the Demolition of  Babylon  the Edification of  Jerusalem  and the Demonstration of the Messiahship of our Spiritual  Jesus  to whom be Glory for ever  Amen  FINIS  BOOKS written by Mr  WOOLSTON  and Sold by him next Door below the Star in  Aldermant  and by the Booksellers of  London
