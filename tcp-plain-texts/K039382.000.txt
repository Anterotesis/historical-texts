repented in all my Life Lookee  Bell  'tis in vain to oppose me for I am resolv'dthe only Way to find out his Character is to see him thus and converse freely with him If he is the Wretch he is reported to be I shall away with him at once and if he is not he will thank me for the Trial and our Union will be the stronger  ARABELLA  I never knew a Woman yet who had Prudence enough to turn off a pretty Fellow because he had a little more Wickedness than the rest of his Neighbours  SOPHIA  Then I will be the first to set a better Example If I did not think a Man's Character was of some Consequence I should not now run such Risques and encounter such Difficulties to be better acquainted with it  ARABELLA  Ha  Sophy  if you have Love enough to be jealous and Jealousy enough to try these Experiments don't imagine tho' you should make terrible Discoveries that you can immediately quit your Inclinations with your Breeches and return so very philosophically to your Petticoats again ha ha  SOPHIA  You may be as merry with my Weaknesses as you please Madam but I know my own Heart and can rely upon it  ARABELLA  We are great Bullies by Nature but Courage and Swaggering are two Things Cousin  SOPHIA  Since you are as little to be convinc'd as I am to be persuadedyour Servant  Going  ARABELLA  Nay  Sophy  This is unfriendlyif you are resolv'd upon your Scheme open to me without Reserve and I'll assist you  SOPHIA  Imprimis  then I confess to you that I have a kind of whimsical Attachment to  Daffodil  not but I can see his Vanities and laugh at 'em  ARABELLA  And like him the better for 'em  SOPHIA  Pshaw don't plague me  Bell  my other Lover the jealous Mr  Tukely    ARABELLA  Who loves you too well to be successful  SOPHIA  And whom I really esteem  ARABELLA  As a good Sort of Man ha ha ha  SOPHIA  Nay shou'd have lov'd him  ARABELLA  Had not a prettier Fellow stept in between who perhaps does not care a Farthing for you  SOPHIA  That's the Question my Dear  Tukely  I say either stung by Jealousy or unwilling to lose me without a Struggle has intreated me to know more of his Rival before I engage too far with him Many strange Things he has told me which have piqu'd me I must confess and I am now prepar'd for the Proof  ARABELLA  You'll certainly be discover'd and put to Shame  SOPHIA  I have secur'd my Success already  ARABELLA  What do you mean  SOPHIA  I have seen him convers'd with him and am to meet him again today by his own Appointment  ARABELLA  Madnessit can't be  SOPHIA  But it has been I tell you  ARABELLA  How howQuickly quickly dear  Sophy  SOPHIA  When you went to Lady  Fanny  's last Night and left me as you thought little dispos'd for a Frolic I dress'd me as you see call'd a Chair and went to the  King'sArms  ask'd for my Gentleman and was shewn into a Roomhe immediately left his Company and came to me  ARABELLA  I tremble for you  SOPHIA  I introduc'd myself as an  Italian  Nobleman just arriv'd  Il Marchese di Macaroni    ARABELLA  Ridiculousha ha  SOPHIA  An Intimate of Sir  Charles Vainlove  's who is now at  Rome  I told him my Letters were with my Baggage at the  Customhouse  He receiv'd me with all the Openness imaginable and wou'd have introduc'd me to his Friends I begg'd to be excus'd but promis'd to attend him today and am now ready as you see to keep my Word  ARABELLA  Astonishingand what did you talk about  SOPHIA  Of various ThingsWomen among the rest and tho' I have not absolutely any open Acts of Rebellion against him yet I fear he is a Traytor at Heart and then such Vanitybut I had not Time  to make great DiscoveriesIt was merely the Prologue The Play is to come  ARABELLA  Act your Part well or we shall hiss you  SOPHIA  Never fear me you don't know what a mad raking wild young Devil I can be if I set my Mind to it  Bell  Laying hold of her  ARABELLA  You fright meyou shall positively be no Bedfellow of mine any longer  SOPHIA  I am resolv'd to ruin my Woman and kill my Man before I get into Petticoats again  ARABELLA  Take Care of a Quarrel tho'a Rival may be too rough with you  SOPHIA  No no Fighting is not the Vice of these Times and as for a little Swaggeringdamn it I can do it as well as the best of 'em  ARABELLA  Hush hush Mr  Tukely  is here  SOPHIA  Now for a Trial of Skill if I deceive him you'll allow that half my Business is done  She walks aside takes out a Glass and looks at the Pictures  Enter TUKELY  TUKELY  Your Servant Miss  Bell  I need not ask if Miss  Sophy  be at home for I believe I have seen her since you did  ARABELLA  Have you Sir You seem disconcerted Mr  Tukely  Has any Thing happen'd  TUKELY  A Trifle Madambut I was born to be trifled with and to be made uneasy at Trifles  ARABELLA  Pray what trifling Affair has disturb'd you thus  SOPHIA  What's the Matter now  Aside  TUKLY  I met Miss  Sophy  this Moment in a Hackney Chair at the End of the Street I knew her by the Pink Neglige√® but upon my crossing the Way to speak to her she turn'd her Head away laugh'd violently and drew the Curtain in my Face  SOPHIA  So so well said Jealousy  Aside  ARABELLA  She was in Haste I suppose to get to her Engagement  TUKELY  Yes yes Madam I imagine she had some Engagement upon her HandsBut sure Madam her great Desire to see her more agreeable Friends need not be attended with Contempt and Disregard to the rest of her Acquaintance  ARABELLA  Indeed Mr  Tukely  I have so many Caprices and Follies of my own that I can't possibly answer for my Cousin's too  SOPHIA  Well said  Bell  Aside  TUKELY  Answer MissNo Heav'n forbid you should for my Part I have given up all my Hopes as a Lover and only now feel for her as a Friend and indeed as a Friend a sincere FriendI can't but say that going out in a Hackney Chair without a Servant and endeavouring to conceal herself is somewhat incompatible with Miss  Sophy  's Rank and Reputation This I speak as a Friendnot as a Lover Miss  Bell  pray mind that  ARABELLA  I see it very plainly Mr  Tukely  and it gives me great Pleasure that you can be so indifferent in your Love and yet so jealous in your Friendship  TUKELY  You do me Honour Miss by your good Opinion  Walks about and sees  Sophy  Who's that pray  ARABELLA  A Gentleman who is waiting for  Sophy  TUKELY  I think she has Gentlemen waiting for her every where  SOPHIA  I am afraid Sir  coming up to him with her Glass  you'll excuse me that notwithstanding your Declaration and this Lady's Compliments there is a little of the Devil call'd Jealousy at the Bottom of all this Uneasiness  TUKELY  Sir  SOPHIA  I say Sir wear your Cloak as long as you please the Hoof will peep out take my Word for it  TUKELY  Upon my Word Sir you are pleas'd to honour me with a Familiarity which I neither expected or indeed desired upon so slight an Acquaintance  SOPHIA  I dare swear you did not  Turns off and hums a Tune  TUKELY  I don't understand this  ARABELLA  This is beyond Expectation  Aside  SOPHIA  I presume Sir you never was out of  England    Picking her Teeth  TUKELY  I presume Sir that you are mistaken I never was so foolishly fond of my own Country to think that nothing good was to be had out of it nor so shamefully ungrateful to it to prefer the Vices and Fopperies of every other Nation to the peculiar Advantages of my own  SOPHIA  Ha ha well said old  England  i'faithNow Madam if this Gentleman would put this Speech into a Farce and properly lard it with Roast Beef and Liberty I wou'd engage the Galleries wou'd roar and halloo at it for half an Hour together Ha ha ha  ARABELLA  Now the Storm's coming  Aside  TUKELY  If you are not engag'd Sir we'll adjourn to the next Tavern and write this Farce between us  SOPHIA  I fancy Sir by the Information of your Face that you are more inclin'd to Tragedy than Comedy  TUKELY  I shall be inclin'd to treat you very ill if you don't walk out with me  SOPHIA  I have been treated so very ill already in the little Conversation I have had with you that you must excuse my walking out for more of it but if you'll persuade the Lady to leave the Room I'll put you to DeathDamme  Going up to him  ARABELLA  For Heaven's sake what's the Matter Gentlemen  TUKELY  What can I do with this Fellow  SOPHIA  Madam don't be alarm'dthis Affair will be very shortI am always expeditious and will cut his Throat without shocking you in the least Come Sir  draws  if you won't defend yourself I must kick you about the Room  Advancing  TUKELY  Respect for this Lady and this House has curb'd my Resentment hitherto But as your Insolence wou'd take Advantage of my Forbearance I must correct it at all Events  Draws  SOPHIA and ARABELLA  Ha ha ha  TUKELY  What is all this  SOPHIA  What would you set your Courage to a poor weak Woman You are a bold  Briton  indeed Ha ha ha  TUKELY  What  Sophia    ARABELLA  Sophia  No no she is in a HackneyChair you know without a Servant in her Pink Neglige√® Ha ha ha  TUKELY  I am astonish'd and can scarce believe my own EyesWhat means this Metamorphosis  SOPHIA  'Tis in Obedience to your CommandsThus equipp'd I have got Access to  Daffodil  and shall know whether your Picture of him is drawn by your Regard for me or Resentment to him  I will sound him from his lowest Note to the Top of his Compass  TUKELY  Your Spirit transports meThis will be a busy and I hope a happy Day for me I have appointed no less than five Ladies to meet me at the Widow  Damply  's to each of whom as well as yourself the accomplish'd Mr  Daffodil  has presented his Heart the Value of which I am resolved to convince 'em of this Night for the sake of the whole Sex  SOPHIA  Pooh pooh that's the old StoryYou are so prejudic'd  TUKELY  I am afraid 'tis you who are prejudic'd Madam for if you will believe your own Eyes and Ears  SOPHIA  That I will I assure youI shall visit him immediately He thinks me in the Country and to confirm it I'll write to him as from thenceBut ask me no more Questions

ARABELLA  What a Couple of blind Fools has Love made of this poor Fellow and my dear Cousin  Sophy  Little do they imagine with all their wise Discoveries that  Daffodil  is as faithful a Lover as he is an accomplish'd GentlemanI pity these poor deceiv'd Women with all my HeartBut how will they stare when they find that he has artfully pretended a Regard for them the better to conceal his real Passion  for meThey will certainly tear my Eyes out and what will Cousin  Sophy  say to me when we are oblig'd to declare our Passion No Matter what 'Tis the Fortune of WarAnd I shall only serve her as she and every other Friend wou'd serve me in the same Situation  A little cheating never is a Sin  At Love or Cardsprovided that you win  Exit ARAB  Daffodil  's Lodgings  Enter DAFFODIL and RUFFLE
