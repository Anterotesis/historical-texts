 AN ACCOUNT OF THE ANCIENT DIVISION OF THE ENGLISH NATION into  Hundreds  and  Tithings  The happy effects of that excellent institutionthat it would be equally beneficial to all other Nations and Countries as well under  monarchical  as  republican  establishmentsand that to the  English Nation  in particular it would afford an effectual means of  re∣forming the Corruption of Parliaments  by rendering the Representation of the People  perfectly equal  in exact numerical Proportion to the total Number of  House∣holders  throughout the whole Realm  Intended as an Appendix to several Tracts on  National Defence  c  By GRANVILLE SHARP  LONDON Printed by GALABIN and BAKER INGRAMCOURT FENCHURCHSTREET MDCCLXXXIV  THE First Division of this King∣dom into  Hundreds  and  Tithings  was ordained by the virtuous and pa∣triotic King Alfred  See Mr Lambard's explication of words prefixed to his Archaionomia on the word  Centuria  who is expressly said to have therein followed the prudent Council given by Jethro to Moses  The st Establishment of this prudent advice of Jethro I have examined more at large in my Tract on  "the Law of Nature and Principles of Action in Man"  p to Wherein I have shewn  the Right of the People  to ELECT Judges and Officers Civil as well as Military Religious Officers and Ministers excepted from the  Colonel  or Captain of a  Thousand  who was also a  justiciary  down to the Serjeant Decurio or Tithingman Deut i all which Officers were  elected  and  nominated  by the people before they were in∣vested with Authority by Moses This  Right of the People  to ELECT  Judges  and  Officers  is clearly confirmed by a parallel Text in the same Book Chap xvi  JUDGES  and  OFFICERS  shalt thou make thee in all thy Gates which the Lord thy God giveth thee throughout thy Tribes and they shall judge the People with just Judgement  When this is rendered literally ac∣cording to the Original the  popular Right of Election  appears still more manifest  Judges and Officers shalt thou give to thyself    which could no otherwise be than by a  free Election  in all their Gates i e the Gates of their Cities where the public Courts were anciently held for the  Judges and Officers  to each Tribe respectivelyLet us be truly thankful to God for the  Justice  of his Laws and let us pray that we may have Grace to adopt them As far as the nature of our political Establishments will legally permit let us for the honour of  Human Nature  imitate the  glorious State of Political Liberty  with which God was pleased to bless his people ISRAEL and in which he would most cer∣tainly have maintained them if they had persevered in  the right Faith  and in due obedience to  his Laws  But when men forsake GOD they unavoidably lose their LIBERTY Let no man conceive that the  Rights of Election  which I have proved by Scripture were the Rights only of a  single  Nation the  People of Israel  on the contrary let us remember that as  all  Nations under the Christian Dispensation or rather  all  Nations that are really  Christians  are said to be engrafted on the  Israelitish  OliveTree and are thereby entitled to the  name  of ISRAEL so they are undoubtedly entitled likewise to all the immunities and privileges of  redeemed Israel  for the only  people  perhaps that are  judicially  excluded from those  national  Rights are the  Branches  which were  broken off from that good OliveTree for their unbelief  i e the Jews themselves who are  broken off  indeed for a  time  a long  time  alas it has now been and are dispersed or  strewed  like  Dead Branches  sepa∣rated from their proper Root  amongst all the nations of the Earth  thus  universally  exhibiting as it were  a monumental Proof  of the Scripture Testimonies against that peculiar Nation  But under the Christian Dispensation there is not only the  same reason  for claiming to the  people  the Is∣raelitish privilege of  electing all temporal  JUDGES and OFFICERS but there are also unquestionable Proofs that the  elective Rights  of  Christian People  are enlarged still farther to the choice of all their  Spiritual Officers  and  Ministers  whereas even in Israel all  Spiritual Functions  were  hereditary  and not  elective  Thus are the  Elective Rights  of Christian People ex∣ceedingly enlarged and all persons who withhold or oppose these just  Rights  ought to beware lest they be found at last amongst the Enemies of the  King of Righ∣teousness  for it is remarkable that the  great apostacy  so long foretold in the Christian Church could not  mani∣fest itself in power  until the unwearied encroachments and usurpations of  Popes Emperors  and  Kings  had with∣drawn from the  Church  i e the  Congregation of Clergy and People  in each Country or District that  most essential Right  of all others the ancient usage of  electing their own Bishops  See a long Note on this Subject beginning at p of my Tract on the Law of Retribution  for  the more commodious Government of  the Israelitish Commonwealth  it being  indeed an Institution thoroughly con∣sistent with the most  perfect state of Li∣berty  that Human Nature is capable of  enjoying and yet competent neverthe∣less to fulfil all the necessary purposes of  mutual Defence the due Execution of all just and equal Laws  and  the sure main∣tenance of the public peace  Wonder∣ful Fruits of Utility would this one Council of Alfred or rather of Jethro produce to the CommonWealth  says the loyal Mr Lambard  if we would no longer use the shadow but hold the sub∣stantial form of the true Tithing  Mirabiles illud unum Aluredi vel potius Je∣thronis concilium allaturum Reipublicae utilitatis fructus si  verae Decuriae  solidam teneremus imagi∣nem nec amplius umbra uteremur  Lambard on the word  Decuria  or  Tithing  In the Laws of King Edward the Confessor this mode of  national Defence  by free popular Societies of Armed Citizens in every District and Vicinage is called  "Summa et

adducerent ad justitiam aut justitiae dicerent ubi esset  the Chief and greatest Security by which all men are sustained in the firmest State  viz that  every one  unusquisque  should establish  himself under the Se∣curity of a Covenant  or Suretyship "which the English call  Freoborhges  " i e  free pledges    but the Yorkshire∣men alone call  Tienmannatela  which expressed in the Latin Tongue is  De∣cem  Hominum numerum  the number of Men  This Security was con∣stituted in the following manner viz that ALL PERSONS  UNIVERSI  of all the Towns of the whole Kingdom ought to be under a  Decenal Surety∣ship so that if one of the Ten should  FORFEIT  viz forfeit his  Free∣pledge  i e his Credit in that little Community as an  honest  and  legal  Mem∣ber of it  probus  et  legalis  see Magna Charta by which estimation alone his Neighbours could so far confide in him as to admit him into their  Tithing  and had a right to expect from him a re∣turn of  mutual security    the nine should  have him to  trial of "RIGHT" or indict him  but if he should abscond a term in Law of    Days should be allowed him being sought in the mean while and found he should be brought to the King's Judgement  i e to Judgement or Justice in the King's Courts  "and there out of his own"  property  should make good whatever  damage he had done And if to this he had forfeited  or failed  Justice should be done of his body But if within the aforesaid term he could not be found the Chief or Head for in every Freeborough  or Tithing  there was  one Chief whom they called Freeborough Head  Freoborges Heofod i e Headborough or Tithingman  should take    of the better sort of people of his Freeborough and also out of the    nearest Freeboroughs he should take of each one Chief and    of the better  sort of people if he can have them  and so the being convened he shall clear himself and his Freeborough if he can do it of the forfeiture and  slight of the aforesaid Malefactor Which if he could not do he with his Freeborough should restore the loss out of the property of the malefactor as long as any should remain failing which he should complete  the restitution  out of his own and that of his Freeborough  and should satisfy  Justice  according to what should be to them lawfully ad∣judged  c Thus all the honest in∣habitants of every vicinage being an∣swerable in their own private fortunes and property for all the damages and de∣predations of robbers housebreakers and other lawless sons of violence com∣mitted within their own respective districts would of course be stimulated by the urgent spur of private interest  to yield up a small portion of their leisure to the necessary  exercise of arms and training  for their mutual defence against every act of violence and injustice and on this ancient provision of the Common Law was apparently founded the  legality  of levying taxes on the inhabitants of London and Middlesex to make good the  damages  occasioned by the alarming riots in the year We ought therefore by no means to repine at the late judgement of the Courts whereby the RiotTax to make good the damages was deemed legal even before the Act was made for levying it but on the contrary to promote as much as possible a still more effectual and complete revival of that most excellent institution of the  Common Law  that it may be constantly and regularly enforced even in less and more ordinary cases of robbery housebreaking c for the immediate recovery of all  damages  and losses by any  act of violence  whatso∣ever the value of the damages should be levyed on  ten housekeepers  that are the nearest inhabitants to the spot where the violence or robbery was committed and if the  nearest housekeepers  should not be able to made good the damage then  times    of the nearest housekeepers  or the hundred ought to be assessed and so on if necessary to the whole county for such was the an∣cient usage by the Common Law for the damage whereby all housekeepers would be prompted by their own private interest to  associate in arms  with their respective neighbours to suppress every act of unjust violence and to maintain the public peace  In the variousaccounts of these ancient Freeboroughs or  Tithings  they are sometimes mentioned as consisting only of  Ten Men  at other times as consist∣ing  of  "ten men and their families"    They be commonly named  TITHINGS  be∣cause they contain as I told you the number of  TENNE MEN WITH THEIR FAMILIES  Lambard's Du∣ties of Constables p  "This frankpledge"  says Lord Coke  consisted  most commonly of  ten house∣holds  c Inst p  and therefore as all males from to years of age are required by law  to have arms and to be duly exercised therein  which in a former Tract I have already proved the number of males in a  Tithing  of the latter description would amount to about  thirty  the pro∣per number for a platoon if the average rate of males to a family might be sup∣posed a just estimation including sons lodgers apprentices journeymen por∣ters and servants though this must vary in different neighbourhoods according to the nature of the trades and occupa∣tions carried on therein as some employ  many hands  and others but very few  Archbishops Bishops Earls Barons and other great men having their own proper officers Serjeants Esquires But∣lers Confectioners Bakers c see the law of King Edward were sup∣posed to have each a  Freeborough  within their own households and were there∣fore not included in the ordinary  Tithings    because they were a sufficient assurance for themselves and for their menial servants  no less than the ten were one for another in  the ordinary Dozeins  See Cowell's Interpreter on the word  Friburgh  This due ex∣emption of the great men from the ob∣ligation of entering into the ordinary  De∣cenaries  I wish to be particularly noticed because it may prevent the opposition of some  highminded  persons who would think themselves degraded perhaps by an  universal  establishment of the  Tithings  On the quotation last made from Dr  Cowell it is necessary to remark that the word  dozeins  is manifestly used for  decenns  or  decenna  and so also very fre∣quently by other law writers but I cannot find that these  legal Societies  or  Associations  of neighbours ever consisted of  dozeins  or  dozens  in the ordinary sense of that term though they are so very frequently called  dozeins  merely I pre∣sume by corruption of speech so that the etymology of the English word  dozen  is not from  duodecim  as one would natu∣rally suppose from the modern applica∣tion of the word but from  decenna  and  dizaine  the Latin and French appella∣tions of the  Tithings  which were regu∣larly  Decenaries  consisting of  ten men  or rather  ten men  and their  families  as I have before remarked But in the re∣vival of  Decenaries  which I wish to promote the number of persons in each  Freeborough or Decenary  whether it  shall consist of  ten housekeepers with their families and servants  or only of  ten men  must be determined by the votes of the inhabitants themselves in every neigh∣bourhood at their several  General Meet∣ings Folkmotes  or  Wardmotes  be∣cause the service must be perfectly vo∣luntary for though the arrangement of the people into  decenary  companies was actually  ordained by the ancient laws of this realm  and was and I trust still is required by the  common law  for the whole kingdom yet one of the most eminent  commonlaw  writers of his time Mr Wm Lambard mentions the formation of these  decenary  companies as being  the free act of the people themselves  in every neighbourhood for according to him the ancient usage was that  all free borne men shoulde  CAST THEM∣SELVES  into several companies by tenne in eche companie  c Duties of Con∣stables  c p and our ancestors could not have had any more urgent in∣ducement to render this service volun∣tary than what the present generation actually feels viz the necessity of selfdefence against  rioters thieves robbers  and  housebreakers  for Mr Lambard informs us just before in the same page that  it was ordained for the more sure  KEEPING OF THE PEACE  and for the better repressing of  THIEVES  and  ROB∣BERS  that all freeborn men should  CAST THEMSELVES  into several com∣panies  c  so that  the  REASON  of this law  on which  the  FORCE of it should depend does not only  still  sub∣sist but is certainly as forcible and ur∣gent as ever it was And though this excellent custom was become almost ob∣solete through neglect and disuse so long ago as the reign of  Queen Elizabeth  yet even then it was still considered as  a  legal  institution required by the  com∣mon law  and the renewal of it was re∣commended as easy and most efficacious for the maintenance of the public peace "whereof" says the learned Lambard speaking of the ancient office of Bors∣holders Tithingmen c  there is yet some shew or remnant in our  LEETS  or Law Days but if the  VERY SUBSTANCE THEREOF WERE  throughly performed as I know no let  says that learned man and surely  no let  has since been ordained  but that by law it may then should the peace of the land be much better maintained  Duties of Constables c p There is no doubt but the effects would be as happy and beneficial as when  the Tithings  were first established by Alfred for all the old Historians agree that an entire stop to  all robbery and violence  was im∣mediately effected by this regulation  In the Chronicon of John Brompton we are informed that  although laws in times of war are silent yet King Alfred in the midst of the clashing of arms made laws and instituted the  Centuries  which they call  Hundreds  and the  Decenaries  which they call  Trithings  he should have said  Tithings    maintained peace amongst his own subjects and chastized  rob∣bers  in such sort that he commanded golden bracelets to be hung up in the roads divided into ways which might brave the avidity of passengers whilst there was none who durst snatch them away  See Twisden's Hist Anglicanae Scriptores Anti∣qui P  Et licet inter arma Leges sileant ipse tamen  Alu∣redus  Rex inter fremitus armorum Leges tulit et  Centurias  quas  Hundredas  dicunt et  Decurias  quas  Trithingas  plainly an error for  Tithingas    vocant instituit pacem inter suos custodivit et  latrones  in tantum castigavit quod in semitis quae per quadri∣vium finduntur armillas aureas jussit suspendi quae viantium aviditatem arriderent dum non essent qui eas arriperent  and Speed also  tells us from William of Malmsbury that "His kingdom hee" Alfred  likewise divided into  Shires Hundreds  and  Ti∣things  for the better ordering and ad∣ministring of Justice and for the abandoning of theeves which had for∣merly increased  by the meanes  the very cause which at present exists  of long warres  whereby notwithstanding the multitude of Souldiers continually im∣ploied it is reported that a  Virgin  might travaile alone in his daies through all his dominions with∣out any violence offered and that bracelets of gold were hanged in the high waies and no man so hardy as to take them away  P  The  ten  householders or masters of families from whose precise number of  ten  the numerical appellations of  De∣cenaries  Tithings  and  Dozeins  are ma∣nifestly derived were themselves also individually distinguished by the title of  Deciners  from the youths journeymen lodgers and servants that were in∣cluded and respectively  pledged  by the  householders  in the several  Decenaries  A right understanding and due appli∣cation of the term  Deciner  being neces∣sary as I conceive towards the pro∣motion of a great national object at pre∣sent the necessary reformation of popu∣lar Representation in Parliament I hope my readers will not think it too tedious to attend a little to the investigation of the word that we may clear it from the indiscriminate use which some lawwri∣ters have made of it  The Circuit thereof  says Dr Cowel in his In∣terpreter speaking of  frankpledge    was called  DECENNA  because it com∣monly consisted of  TEN HOUSEHOLDS  and every particular person thus mu∣tually bound for himself and his neighbours was called  DECENNIER  more commonly I believe  Decener  and afterwards by corruption  Dozener    BECAUSE  he was of one  DECENNA or  other  But this reason is not suffi∣ciently accurateThe  youths servants  c were all  of one  DECENNA  or other  yet were they not  Decenners  though they were also mutually bound by oath for their good behaviour in their respective  Decenaries  but those men only were properly  Deciners  who were more immediately responsible for all the rest by being the  masters  of the several families viz only the TEN  householders  in every TITHING who paid scot and lot and were answerable for the pay∣ment of all  national  as well as  provincial  and  parochial  burthens these only were the men who had a  judicial capacity  and were called altogether by the chief  Freeborg  or  Headborough  on all occa∣sions to consult and determine on every question or extraordinary business with∣in the extent of their division All the individuals of the division indeed were suitors in the  Tithing  Court and might there be present as all courts were open and amenable thereto for offences for the  Decenna  or  Tithing  Courts how∣ever insignificant so confined a jurisdiction as a  Tithing  may appear were of admi∣rable use in promoting  Justice  and de∣ciding differences and quarrels amongst neighbours The learned Author of the Notes on Fortescue folio edit in p speaking of  the Court of the Freeborough  or  Tithing  adds  "wherein"  says he  the  Tithingman  or  Headborough  was the JUDGE  And indeed they are intituled in the laws of the Confessor JUSTICIARII JUSTICES  for such was their jurisdiction and office within their  Tithing  It is necessary however for the proper understanding of the chapter wherein this is men∣tioned to be previously informed that the Latin noun  Friborgus  of the mas∣culine gender does not properly signify a  FreeBorough Tithing  or Association of  ten men  but rather one indivi∣dual  FreeBorgess  of that Society but when the Society or Association it∣self is to be collectively understood the word is generally though not always  As there is an example at the latter end of this very law in question wherein  Friborgos  in all the copies is expressed instead of the accusative plural of the neuter noun  Friborga  though the subject manifestly relates to three Friburgs or Societies and not to three indivi∣dual  Freeburgesses  expressed in the neuter gender  Fri∣borgum  as Dr Cowel rightly ex∣presses in his Interpreter on the word  Froborgh  alias  Fridburgh  c  It is also manifest by the explanation of titles given by the learned Lambard that  nine persons  of the Tithing were intituled FREOBORH  Atque hinc  novem illi  quidem FREOBORH id est ingenui fidejussores dicebantur nos in titulis Cu∣riarum  Francos Plegios  appellamus  Decimus  ille TEOTHUNGMON id est  Decurio  dictus est quo no∣mine hac nostra est tempestate occidentalibus Anglis notissimus Eum alii TIENHEOFOD alii FREOBOR∣HESHEOFOD id est vadem primarium et praecipuum nuncupabant  Lambard on the word  Centuria  that is  FreeSure∣ties "whom we"  says Mr Lambard  "call frank pledges"  and that  the tenth man was called  TEOTHUNGMON  that is  "DECURIO" or  Tithingman  and that "  others called him  TIENHEOFOD" head of ten and  "others again Freo∣borhes heofod"  Freeburgesshead  or  ChiefPledge  A comparison of these terms with the terms mentioned in the old laws of St Edward N  o  and and the relation these terms bear respectively to each other will clearly  demonstrate that the  Justitiarios super quosque decem Friborgos  therein men∣tioned were no other than  Tithingmen  the  Heads  or  Chiefs  of each  Decenary  who in Latin were called  Decani  or  Deans  and that the  DecemFribor∣gos  d Law of St Edward De  Centurionibus  et  capi∣talibus Friborgis  Cum autem contingeret quod quidam stulti et im∣probi gratis et nimis consuete erga vicinos suos forisfa∣cerent caeperunt sapientes ad invicem super hoc ha∣bere consilium et statuerunt JUSTICIARIOS super quosque  decem Friborgos  quos  Decanos  possumus appellare anglice vero  Tienheofod  dicti sunt  Decemvir  caput de decem c  mentioned in that sentence do not signify  ten Tithings  or  Boroughs  in their collective capacity which would amount to a  HundredCourt  but only ten  individuals  the  ten Householders  or  Deceners  of the Tithing each of whom Mr Lambard calls  "Freoborh"  or Free∣burgess This being understood we may safely proceed to speak of the au∣thority of the  Tithingmen  in their re∣spective  divisions  "These"  A continuation of the d Law of st Edward beginning from the end of the last quotation of it  Isti inter villas vicinos causas tractabant se∣cundum forisfacturas emendationes capiebant con∣cordationes faciebant videlicet de pascuis pratis messibus de litigationibus inter vicinos innu∣merabilibus huiusmodi decertationibus que humanam fragilitatem infestant eam incessanter oppugnant Cum autem causae majores erumpebant referebantur ad superiores eorum justiciarios quos supradicti sa∣pientes super eos constituerant scilicet super decem decanos qúos possumus dicere centuriones vel cen∣tenarios eo quod super centum friborgos judica∣bunt  according to the Saxon laws collected by King Edward the Confessor  TRIED CAUSES  among the villages and neighbours and according to conviction  or forfeiture on trial  "took satisfaction"  or da∣mages  and settled agreements concern∣ing pastures meadows harvests as also litigations between neighbours and innu∣merable such like disputes which infest the weakness of human nature and con∣tinually annoy it But when causes of  more consequence occurred they were re∣ferred to their superior  JUSTICIARIES  whom the wise men  or national coun∣cil  had appointed over them that is over ten Deans  "or  chiefs of tens  "  whom we may call  CENTURIONS or CEN∣TENARII  hundreders  because they had jurisdiction over  AN HUNDRED FRIBORGS  i e an hundred Free∣burgesses or  Deciners    Thus it is manifest that the  Hundreders  or  High Constables  were also  Justiciaries  so that every  Hundred Householders  throughout the kingdom had a complete establishment of  Civil Officers  i e a High Constable and ten Constables all of whom were  Justiciaries  within their respective jurisdictions to preserve the peace and settle differences amongst themselves and their respec∣tive families And though each or all of these officers sat as  Judges  or  Preci∣dents  in their respective courts yet their power was duly limited by the opinion and determination of the  House∣holders  or  Deciners  from whom the  Juries  the real judges of the causes were regularly chosen and still are to this day in most cities and trading towns as in London without regard to any other qualification than that of their be∣ing  housekeepers  of the vicinage indif∣ferent to the parties of unblameable character and sufficient substance not to be suspected of undue bias or as it is expressed in an old form  such as be next neighbours most sufficient and least suspicious  And in the act of Edward I there is an express clause reserving the ancient rights of  Juries  to  cities  and  burghs  And Mr Hawkins on mentioning this and another statute West remarks thereupon  that neither by common law nor by these sta∣tutes  there was any necessity in proceed∣ings before Justices in Eyre c that  PETIT JURORS  should be  FREEHOL∣DERS  and if so  says he  it seems probable that there is no greater neces∣sity that  GRAND JURORS  making an enquiry before them should be  FREE∣HOLDERS  and if a  GRAND JUROR  before such Justices need  NOT  be a  FREEHOLDER  why should there be a greater necessity that a  GRAND JUROR  before other Justices should be a  FREE∣HOLDER  c Pleas of the Crown d book chap p And he repeats this doctrine in chap sect  That at the common law there was no necessity that  JURORS  should have  ANY FREEHOLD  as to inquests before Justices in Eyre or in cities or burghs  c whereby the  judicial  capacity of the Housekeepers or  De∣ciners  without any qualification as  Land∣holders  is I trust sufficiently established We are misled also in the sense of the word  Deciner  when it is applied as by the learned Cowell in a peculiar manner to the chief or head of a  Tithing    It signifieth  says he  in the ancient monuments of the law such as were wont to have the oversight and check of  TEN FRIBOURGS  for the maintenance of the King's peace  But the  Chief  of the ten as I have already shewn had his proper titles of  Headborough  and  Ti∣thingman  and though each chief was al∣ways a  Deciner  as being himself  one  of the  ten  incorporated  householders  yet he had no peculiar title of  Deciner  any otherwise than being the chief of the  Deciners  in his division The youths and others that were  not householders  were pledged by the  Deciners  as appears by Briton cap  Volons nous que trestous ceux de xiv ans desouthe nous facent  le serement cet velons que toutz soient en  Dizeyne  et pleuys par  Des∣cyners  sauve gentz de religion clers et chevaliers et leur fitz eynes et femes    We will that all those which are fourteen years old shall make oath to us  c  and that all shall be in  TITHINGS  and pledged by Deciners  c The law could not mean that  all  should be pledged by the respective Head∣boroughs alone but certainly by the TEN  householders  of each  Decenary  And Dr Cowell himself also in the latter part of that article says  that  DECENNIER  is not now used for the chief man of a  DOZEN  but for him that is sworne to the King's peace  neither in this is he sufficiently accurate for the being  sworn to the King's peace  did not consti∣tute a  Decener  in the proper sense of the word though it included the person sworn in the jurisdiction of a  Decenary  The title of  Deciner  could not pro∣perly belong to any but the  ten  house∣holders themselves from whose  number  his division was formerly called  Tienman∣tale  id est says Mr Lambard  Decem∣virale collegium  a  society of ten men Nine  of these as Mr Lambard declares were called  Freoborh Free Burgess  i e  free pledges  and the tenth was called Teothungmon Tithingman i e  De∣curio  Now it seems the office and title of  Decurio  was used in Britain long be∣fore the Saxon Kings by the Romans as well in their  civil  as their  military  establishments and the learned author of the notes on the folio edition of Fortescue's excellent tract  de Laudibus Legum Angliae  observes in p  that the  ROMANS  had their laws in such parts of this land as they had their most civil government in I mean  says he  in colonies hither deduced  For every colony was but an image of the mother city with like holy rites like courts laws  c  and for the most part with  DUUMVIRI  instead of Consuls and  AEDILES  and  DECU∣RIONES  in lieu of a Senate and it is clear  says he  that divers colonies from Rome were in Britain as at Ca∣melodunum now Malden in Essex  c  The consideration of this circumstance enables us to propose a much more pro∣bable etymology of the English word  Denizen  than what is generally assigned Lord Coke supposes it from  deins nee born within  and also from  Do∣naison  because the freedom  is given by the King  But a learned writer Davies asserts that  Denizen is a British law term which the Saxons and Angles found here and retained  It could not therefore be derived from  the  French  tongue before that modern language was known or even formed  Neither is the  Welch  etymology of it at all satisfactory because it seems very uncouth and not sufficiently similar in sound to the word But if we derive the word immediately from the  Latin  it will appear most natural and easy both in  sound  and  sense  for the word  Deni  being derived  à Decem pro Deceni  is a proper adjective expressive of its relation to the number of  ten  persons in a  Decenary  and as the Romans had their  Decuriones  and consequently  Decenaries  also a proper  Latin  verb to express the initia∣tion or introduction of a person to the privileges and franchises of a  Decenary  is very naturally formed from the word  Deni  viz  Denizo  which verb and its derivatives are frequently used by our lawwriters when they speak of the admission of  Aliens  to the franchises  of the native inhabitants and the said  franchises  being maintained in ancient times by mutual  frankpledge  in the se∣veral  Decenaries  it is obvious that the participle  "Denizatus"  which frequent∣ly occurs and the derived nounsubstan∣tive  "Denizatio"  are applied in such cases in their proper  Latin  sense though the lawwriters who used them have overlooked that most obvious etymology which is confirmed by the  sound  as well as the true  Latin sense  of those terms  Lord Coke says  Denizen  is taken for an alien born that is  infranchised  or DENIZATED by Letters Patent where∣by the King doth grant unto him that in all things he should be reputed esteem∣ed held and governed as our liege sub∣ject sprung up  from his ancestors  within our said kingdom of England and not otherwise nor in any other manner  And he cites Dier in the same page Inst lib p respecting this  ligeance  of  Denizens  Ligentia Domino Regi debita c Data est aut per  denizationem  aut  per naturaliza∣tionem  When foreigners therefore were admitted to the privileges and fran∣chises of Englishmen they became the King's  liege  subjects  esse ad fidem Regi Angliae  and were of course  deni∣zated  or admitted to be members of some  Decenary  and would be sworn to their ligeance in common with other sub∣jects in the court of  frankpledge  and if the  denizated  stranger rented a house and payed scot and lot and other rates he became a  Frioborh  or  Freeburgess  having a right to vote for Representatives in  the national Council  so that Lord Coke was certainly right in using the terms  infranchised  and  denizatus  as synonymous for the  renting of a house at a certain rent by the year  is the ancient legal description of  burgage  tenure "It is called  BURGH" says Sir Edward Coke  because it sendeth  BURGESSES  to Parliament  And though this is not the proper derivation of the word it is certainly the  usage  of  borough  and as well as the  right of all Burgesses  "They that have tenements"  says Littleton  within the Burrough or Burgh hold of the King their tenements and every tenant for his tenement ought to pay to the King  A CERTAIN RENT BY THE YEAR  Inst lib c sect The next section declares the same doctrine concerning those who  rent  of any other Lord  And the same manner is where another Lord spiritual or temporal is Lord of such a  BURROUGH  and the  TENANTS OF THE TENEMENTS  in such a Borough hold of their Lord  TO PAY EACH OF THEM YEARLY AN ANNUAL  RENT  Sect  And it is called  TENURE IN BURGAGE  says Little∣ton  for that the tenements within the Burrough be  HOLDEN OF THE LORD OF THE BURROUGH BY CER∣TAINE RENT c  And it is to wit that the ancient townes called  BURROUGHES BE THE MOST AN∣CIENT TOWNES THAT BE IN ENG∣LAND  for the townes that now be  CITIES OR COUNTIES  in old time were  BOROUGHES and  called  BOROUGHES  for of such old townes called  BO∣ROUGHES CAME THE BURGESSES OF THE PARLIAMENT  when the King hath summoned his Parliament  Sect  Now this description of paying  an annual rent  or  holding tenements by certain rent by the year  is the pro∣per distinction of a tenant  in Burgage  from a  tenant at will  because the latter  "hath no certain nor sure estate"  says Littleton  for the Lessor may put him out at what time it pleaseth him  Lib c viii § But very different is the case of  tenants for years  as Littleton remarks in the same Chapter  Otherwise it is if tenant for yeares which knoweth the end of his terme doth sowe the land  c  Ibid  and those persons who agree with the owners of their houses at a  certain rent  howsoever small for any  fixed time  if it be but for  half a year  or even for a  quarter of a year  are never∣theless to be esteemed in law as  tenants for years    quod tenent ad terminum annorum  Lib C Sect For they enjoy a free and  certain  posses∣sion to the end of the  agreed term  so that their  tenure is perfectly free  and they have sometimes been intituled  "Liberi Tenentes"  and  Freeholders  in contradistinction to  tenants in villanage  though they are indeed  freholders  in a  very different sense from the common acceptation of the term  freeholder  now applied only to those who are properly  land owners  which would therefore be a less equivocal title for them the others being also  freeholders  or  free tenants  though in a less durable  tenure  But their ancient indisputable RIGHT of  send∣ing Burgesses to Parliament  proves their  freedom  as members of the community In the  Borough  of Southwark and many others to this day  the renters  of tene∣ments or  housekeepers in general  paying scot and lot are the Electors of the De∣puties to Parliament so that the doc∣trine is unquestionable And in the City of Westminster and several other an∣cient cities the same RIGHT by  bur∣gage tenure  of voting for Representatives prevails to this day because  all Cities  were originally deemed  Boroughs  as being the habitations of  freoborges  or  free pledges  i e the associated  house∣holders  who were mutually  pledged  to maintain the public peace and defend and support the due execution of the laws and if the right of voting were fully restored throughout the kingdom to all  householders  or  masters of families  who principally support the burthens of the state even if the franchise should descend no lower it would be amply sufficient I trust to destroy the present deplorable corruption in the representa∣tion or rather the  misrepresentation  of the Commons and to restore the ancient dignity and freedom of Parliament especially if all the said  householders  were duly incorporated as  Deciners  or  FreeBorhes  in their respective neighbour∣hoods  For then the number of  Deciners  or  Free∣holders  in each county would be regularly known howsoever much the numbers  of other males in the several  Tithings  might vary and the advantage of this  regularity of numbers  would not only be the effecting a proportionable  regularity of manners  but it would also greatly fa∣cilitate the much wishedfor measure of a  more equal representation of the people  nay the representation may be made not only  more equal  but  most equal  or  per∣fectly equal  if all  Deciners  in each county were allowed to vote as unques∣tionably in justice and constitutional right they ought to do for the junction of ten  equal  hundreds of  Deciners  into one associated body would form the court of the  thousand  well known in the Is∣raelitish commonwealth which consi∣dered as a proportionable  division  of a county perfectly regular in numerical order both of Officers and other  Deci∣ners  would much facilitate the conduct∣ing and ordering of public business  And  two  such divisions of  a thousand Deciners each  would be a proper num∣ber to send  one Deputy  to Parliament according to the present population of the kingdom so as not to exceed but rather diminish the present number of representatives Thus a  most equal repre∣sentation of all the families in the kingdom  would be obtained and  two thousand  families one with another might well afford to pay ample wages to  one  Repre∣sentative and the stipend might be very easily collected if the  Decenaries  were duly formed and established and the several courts which regularly arise from the  Decenaries  viz the  Hundred  Courts and also the Courts of  one Thousand  fa∣milies each above proposed and lastly the junction of  two  such  Courts of the Thousand  for the election of  one  Repre∣sentative in the great Common Council of the Realm The people of whatever  parties or separate interests might go up altogether with their separate  Tithings  or by their  Hundreds  to the Poll Books in like manner as the ancient Romans voted by their  Centuries  by which means  order  would be preserved and no persons would be permitted to vote but those that were  known  to  dwell  and  reside  in the place or county where the election is made according to an ancient rule of the constitution  eligantur in quolibet comitatu per homines in eodem comitatu commorantes et residentes  See my Tract on  Equitable Representation  c p and and also an Act of Parlia∣ment there quoted which is still in force Hen V c It is therefore an act of gross corruption utterly re∣pugnant to the ancient constitution of the kingdom to bear  the travelling charges of voters  who dwell in distant places for such ought not to be permit∣ted  to vote at all except on the spot where they reside by which not only  much expence  would be saved to the Can∣didates but also much immorality de∣bauchery and tumult against the public peace at elections  Extract respecting  Bribery at Elections  from  A Representation of the Injustice and dangerous Ten∣dency of  tolerating Slavery  in England  Printed in P to  "But how is he" a Negro claimed by a  Slaveholder  as private property "to be divested of his  human na∣ture  or of his just right to the King's protection  "A man may indeed be said to be divested of his  humanity  st in a moral sense by his own action in stooping to any kind of baseness beneath the dignity of a  man  And dly by the execution of the laws in punishment of some particular kinds of baseness for which a man may  lawfully  be divested of his huma∣nity by a  civil death  that is may be  disabled to hold any office or franchise  c  as if such person was naturally dead  This is one of the penalties ex∣pressed in a Statute Geo II ch against bribery and corruption in Parliamentary Elections whereby not less the  Briber  than the  Bribed  whether the of∣fence be committed  by himself or any person employed by him  is subjected to the divesture abovemen∣tioned But the vilest and most ignorant Negro Slaves are not so  inhumanly  base and degenerate as these Time∣servers who offend against God the King their friends and fellow subjects themselves and all their unhappy posterity even the children that are unborn They are enemies to the State infinitely more to be dreaded than the most puissant foreign power at open war  "No shuffling arts or equivocations whatsoever can lighten this monstrous load of guilt for which the of∣fenders must  one day  most certainly be called to account notwithstanding that they may have escaped the penal∣ties of this English Statute for indeed it is merely the penalties or execution of the said Statute which they escape and not the guilt of breaking it because the same is so warily drawn up that there is not the least room for mental reservation  "A very large proportion of the freeholders in this kingdom it is to be feared are involved in this horrid guilt Nay every elector who hath but even EATEN or DRUNK at the expence of another during the time of an election is likewise in some measure guilty though charity will incline us to suppose that their offence is for the most part occasioned by ignorance rather than wilful corruption for not only money but also any  Gift Office Imployment or OTHER REWARD WHATSOEVER  is forbid by the said Act Now this prohibition must necessarily include  meat  and  drink  since these articles cannot be considered below the esti∣mation of a "REWARD" because they are expresly prohibited by a preceding Act still in force viz W III ch whereby those Candidates who shall  di∣rectly  or  indirectly  give present or allow to any per∣son or persons having voice or vote in such election any money MEAT DRINK ENTERTAINMENT or PROVISION c are rendered incapable though elected  to act sit or have any vote or place in parlia∣ment  c  Happy would it be for England if this salutary law could be strictly enforced Bribes in mo∣ney places c are not productive of half so much evil as the debaucheries of  election entertainments  be∣cause the pernicious effects of the latter are so perma∣nent that they may fairly be said to be transmitted from  election  to  election  The gross immorality as well as the deplorable idleness and poverty all forerunners of slavery which too much prevail in many parts of this kingdom ought I sincerely believe to be principally attributed to the unlawful practice of  opening houses for public entertainment at elections  and we cannot hope that this dangerous evil will ever be corrected unless the wisdom of the legislature shall hereafter think fit to oblige every candidate as soon as he declares him∣self such to promise upon oath that he will strictly ob∣serve every article of the last mentioned Act against treating electors This long digression from the subject of Negro Slaves the author hopes may be pardoned especially if the reader will please to consider that ci∣vil and political Slavery as well as Slavery to sensual appetites are so very nearly connected with each other in their nature and effects that it is no very considerable transition from the present point to speak of them together But the case of this poor Negro is very dif∣ferent If he is a Slave yet it was not with his own consent that he was made so He neither  sold himself  nor has he  betrayed others  and cannot therefore be liable to such severe penalties He has not been guilty of any offences that I know of for which he might  lawfully  like corrupt and venal voters who accept of money meat or drink at elections  be divested of his humanity  and therefore it must certainly be allowed that he dif∣fers from a horse or a dog in this very  essential point  viz  his humanity"  would be prevented  The number of houses in England and Wales in the year fell short of a  million as the reader may see by a much better authority than mine is that  of the very able and ingenious calculator Dr Price  SeeObservations on the Population of England and Wales p  Total of houses charged charge∣able and excused In In  But for the sake of a round number  "Let it however"  says Dr Price  "be stated at a million"  p The number of  Deciners  or  Householders  we may therefore also state at  one million  for the character of  Householder  without farther  distinction  happily in∣cludes all persons of every  rank  and  de∣nomination  that ought in  strict justice  and ancient prescription of constitutional  right  to elect and send their own Re∣presentatives to Parliament whether as  Knights Citizens  or  Burgesses  The million of  Householders  would form exactly ONE THOUSAND divisions of  one thousand Householders  each viz  Courts of the Thousand  which I have before recommended from ancient exam∣ple and the junction of  two  such  Courts of the Thousand  for the election of  one  Member of Parliament as before pro∣posed would form Courts of  two thousand Householders  each which would elect  five hundred Representatives  for South Britain a proportion sufficiently near to the number at present elected for that part of the king∣dom because a reduction in number would perhaps be more beneficial than otherwise for certain it is that the an∣cient  Parliaments were not near so nu∣merous as at present even without reckoning the Deputies from North Britain  This plan would indeed occasion some variation in modes and forms but no real  innovation  with respect to the national constitution because the  right of election  would still be vested where it ought viz in ALL  the free Householders  or Freoborges of ALL  the counties  and that in the most  perfect proportion of equality  that can be desired which ought surely to recommend the proposal if  equal representation  is at all a worthy objectif  justice  and  right  are to be pre∣ferred to their opposite extremes  inequity  or iniquity and  tort  which have too long prevailedor lastly if we have honesty or humanity enough left amongst us in the fear of God to  reject the evil and choose the good  i e to ex∣ercise  that only faculty which materially distinguishes men from brutes  Should we ever be so happy as to see the true divisions of  Tithings  and  Hundreds  reestablished in this realm and the just reformation of Parliament as here pro∣posed to be effected by them actually take place by the establishment of  equal representation  numerically exact which it really may be if we have but  common honesty  enough amongst us to  desire  and  promote  it there will be an admirable harmony in the several gradations and proportions of public officers or ma∣gistrates over the  Commons of England and Wales  according to the present supposed state of population viz  Deciners  or  Householders  pay∣ing scot and lot and mutu∣ally pledging each other and their respective  families  and servants to the common  peace and common de∣sence  Tithingmen  or  Captains  of  Tens  the elected heads of every ten Deciners being  Consta∣bles  by the common law  Hundreders  the elected chiefs of every ten Tithings be∣ing  HighConstables  and  Justiciaries  or  Justices  by the common law  Chiliarchs  or  Colonels  the elected  Chiefs of Thousands  being not only  Civil Magis∣trates  or  Justices  but also the King's military Lieute∣nants in their districts  Senators  or  Representatives  in Parliament elected  every year once and more often if need be  in courts of Deciners each  But the facility of  equalizing  and there∣by  reforming the representation of the people  in the great national Council is not the only benefit that might be ob∣tained by restoring the ancient mode of government by  Tithings Hundreds  c  In all these various divisions of the people regular courts were anciently held for the maintenance of  peace  and  right  and for adjusting all differences amongst neighbours  without expence  for there was no cause or contest of such magnitude and importance for which a popular court of proportionable dignity could not be found in the larger divisions of Wappentakes Trithings and Shires to adjust and determine it whereby tedious and vexatious lawsuits and the ruinous expences attending them were happily avoided In like manner  the general Assemblies  or  Congregations  held in the gates of the Israelites while under the theocracy were esteemed  courts for justice and judgement  wherein presided  Judges and Officers that were freely elected  by the inhabitants of each city or district as I have elsewhere shewn see p and the same reason∣able mode of settling private differences by the  Congregation  or Church was not unknown even among Heathen Nations The people of Ephesus it seems retained this salutary constitution of popular liberty even when under the yoke of the Roman  Beast  and had a power of holding popular assemblies called  Ecclesia  or Church for resol∣ving difficult questions and disputes be∣tween individuals besides the ordinary Courts of Justice under the  Roman De∣puties  for common offences This ap∣pears by the speech of the Town Clerk  of Ephesus recorded in Acts xix who after he had appeased the tumult and confusion of the people that had hastily run together without notice or summons to specify the cause of assem∣bling he said  Ye have brought hither these men  meaning two of Paul's companions whom they had seized  which are neither robbers of Churches nor yet blasphemers of your Goddess Wherefore if Demetrius and the crafts∣men which are with him have a matter against any man  THE LAW IS OPEN  or ratherthe courtdays are held  and there are  DEPUTIES  let them implead one another But if ye enquire any thing concerning  OTHER MATTERS  it shall be determined in a  LAWFUL ASSEM∣BLY  in a lawful  Ecclesia  ie in a  congregation convocated  or called together in due form and order  by the proper officers this having been neglected in the then last hasty and tu∣multuous assembling of the people which occasioned the Ephesian TownClerk's harangue So perfectly unexceptionable is this mode of determining private quarrels and contests without expence by a  popular assembly  that it seems clear∣ly to be pointed out  for the practice of Christians  in the commands even of OUR LORD HIMSELF on the case of a tres∣passing brother Mat xviii  Go and tell him his fault  said our Lord  between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy brother But if he will not hear take with thee one or two more  c  And if he shall neglect to hear them    "  tell unto  THE CHURCH" not unto the  Prelate of the Church  as Popish writers contend therein grossly pervert∣ing  So deluded and unguarded has the Roman Church been in her  apostacy  that a very learned Jesuit Cor∣nelius à Lapide was not ashamed to suppose  various causes wherein this order  of redress commanded in this text "  might be omitted or  INVERTED" he might as well have said at once PERVERTED  Porrò varias ob causas  HIC ORDO OMITTI  vel  INVERTI  potest ac su∣hinde debet ut is qui peccavit statim deferatur  AD SU∣PERIOREM  c which being no part of the  order  en∣joined by Christ is a manifest PERVERSION of the com∣mand a glaring attempt to  render the word of God of none effect by vain traditions  for which he had no better authority than a bare reference to some of his own order one  Salmeron  c  the divine command by their vain tra∣ditions but  "unto the con∣gregation"  including the Laity as well as Clergy And the Apostle Paul re∣proved the Corinthians for carrying their contests about worldly matters  things pertaining to this life before the  established imperial Courts of Justice where unbelievers presided  which contests ought to have been judged amongst themselves by the  Congregation of Christian Brethren  Cor vi  But after  the general establishment of Christianity  in this or any other nation the several popular Courts of the  Ti∣things  or  Hundreds  or  Thousands  or  Counties  duly convened are the proper  Congregations of Christian Brethren  for every neighbourhood and in ancient times all those courts where the sheriffs held their  Tourns  or  rotulary  visita∣tions took

correc∣tion the  episcopal Authority  and more especially that which ought to restrain the  Laity  being reduced almost to no∣thing through the fallacious enervating innovations and usurpations of the  an∣tichristian church of Rome  the grand  enemy  The inimical spirit of  Popery  against the true Chris∣tian  Episcopacy  began very early to be manifested for the  Apostacy  could not generally take place as I have before remarked until the  Clergy and People  were de∣prived of their ancient  right of electing their own Bishops  so that a violent usurpation of that  right  must of course be found amongst the  first innovations of antichrist  A remarkable instance of it by POPE GREGORY THE FIRST in the year I find recorded even by a  popish  Abbot who appeals to  Gregory's  own epistles and de∣cretals for the truth of it so that the  apostacy  was cer∣tainly at that time begun for though Gregory him∣self is too commonly esteemed a good primitive  Bishop  yet his Church had then for  several years  back received the brand mark of the  growing apostacy  by permitting their Bishops to revive the  wounded head  of Roman power by assuming the Pagan Title of  Pontifex Maximus  which the Emperors of Rome  alone  had exclusively held from the time of Julius Caesar down at least to Valen∣tinian the Third to whom it may be traced if not to Augustulus till it became extinct or dead with the power of the last Emperor of the Western branch so that  Pontifex Maximus  was manifestly the  head  that was as it were wounded to death by a sword  viz the sword of Odoacer who then took possession of  "the seat of the Dragon"  and set up an independent  kingdom  in ROME itself without the pecu∣liar title of UNLIMITED ROMAN dominion so that af∣terwards when  the Bishops of Rome  by assuming that title did actually revive that blasphemous head  his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the Beast"  and well might they  wonder  because the title of  Pontifex Maximus  is not less foreign to the pri∣mitive church of Christ than it had been  peculiar  to the head of the  Roman  idolatrous  Augurs  on account of a  ridiculous  and  strange  kind of ceremony in the inaugu∣ration of the elected PONTIFF  La Consecratione di questo PONTEFICE e tanto  ridicula et strana  che ella merita d'essere tutta interamente dimostrata nel medesimo modo che l'ha scritta Prudentio il quale dice che questo PONTEFICZ nel suo habito  Pontificale  con  la mitera  and it was a  mitre  of the same shape as those worn by the modern  Pontifs  except that it was not then  marked  with the ominous insignia of  three crowns  and the  spike  at the top as represented in a coin of Augustus Caesar was not yet converted into  a cross    in testa et la veste alzata  entravia in una fossa supra la quale era un  PONTE  di legno tutto buccato  so that the name of  Pontifex  is manifestly derived from this  wooden Pons  or Bridge bored full of holes  dove dal vittimario era condotto un toro ornato tutto di fiori et d'oro intorno al capo che il detro conduttore feriva nel petto et del  Sangue  cosi caldo che n'usciva et trapelava  per i buscbi del  PONTE  cra il detto  PONTEFICE tutto imbrattato confregarse ne gl' occhi gl'orecchi le labia et la bocca et cosi uscendo fuora cosi sporcho et brutto et  molto terribile a ri∣guardare  era da tutto il populo salutato et ADORATO c  Dis∣corso della Religione de gl'antichi Romani Composto in Franzese dal S  Guglielmo Choul  et tradotto in Toscano da M  Gabriel Simeoni  Fiorentino in Lione P  whom they placed in his pontifical robes under a wooden PONS or bridge built for that purpose over a dry ditch and bored full of holes that the blood of the victim a bull sacrificed to Jupiter on the top of the bridge might fall through the holes upon the head and robes of the PONTIFF whereby that  Vicar of Satan on earth  was rendered  "terrible to behold"  that he might be  "saluted"  most "probably on the FEET "  and  ADORED  by the people  " whereby the ancient Pagan  Pontifs  were notable types as well of the  bloody  Roman Emperors who afterwards usurp∣ed to themselves the  pontifical  dignity and office and were likwise ADORED and  deified  as of the still  more bloody  though ADORED  ecclesiastical  Apostates who under the  same title  and authority of  Pontifex Maximus  drenched all Europe in  blood  by ordering  crusadoes  even  against Christians  and inciting their votaries to  blood  by grants of plenary indulgences for sin  This true etymology of the word  Pontifex  proves that it is  foreign  and inapplicable to any office or dignity in the  Church of Christ  though Latin writers since the middle of the sixth century have industriously substi∣tuted it for  Episcopus  the proper official title of  Christian Bishops  Near twenty years after the time that the  Roman  Emperors lost this title of  unlimited  and  illegal  power by the  sword  of ODOACER it was wickedly assumed by Pope  Gelasius  and afterwards by Anastasius the second and other succeeding Popes as the learned  Anthony Van Dale  has proved in the second of his nine Dissertations p Nevertheless  the wounded head  could not be said to be completely  healed  and consequently the com∣mencement of years of  bestial  power could not take place whilst the  regal  power of the  Heruli  of the Gothes or of the Greek Emperor by his Exarchs were possessed of  the throne of the Beast  But  before  the time of Pope Gregory three of the first national regal governments or horns without reckoning the go∣vernment of the  Greek  Emperors which does not so properly fall under that description because it was cotemporary with the  former  empire which sprang up from the ruins of the  Imperial Pontifex Maximus  had actually possessed themselves of the  imperial  city by  conquest  and again had successively lost their domi∣nion being fundamentally destroyed and  "plucked up by the roots"  viz the kingdom of the Vandals from Africa under Genseric that of the Heruli under Odo∣acer and that of the Ostrogoths from Theodoric to Tottilas and Theias And as soon as these  three horns were fallen  from their power in the  bloody city  Pope  Pelagius  a name which signifies DIVISION as much as the name of the ancient  Peleg  or  Phalec "for in his days was the earth divided"  was emboldened publicly to avow and establish a system of  religious persecution  and  compulsion  in order to give effectual weight to papal decisions for he ordained  that Haeretics and Schismatics might be coerced by the  SECULAR ARM  when they could not be drawn to wholesome doctrine by arguments    Ut haeretici et schismatici coerceri etiam SECULARI MANU possent quando ad sanitatem rationibus non deducerentur  Platinae hist de vitis pontificum p xxxiii b And Pope Gregory was so confident in this  pontifical  system of the SECULAR ARM as well as all his successors who have generally been adroit in engaging the neighbouring powers to avenge the  Papal  quarrels occasionally one upon another that he was not content merely to  rebuke  but dared even to  affront  the Greek Emperor  Mauricius  by contumeliously  taunting  him with his  very low descent ex infima sorte "hominum"  said Gregory See Platinae hist p xxxv  We need not wonder therefore at his boldness in usurping an  unlimited  authority over the poor  unarmed  Italian BISHOPS who were otherwise his equals in real dignity of office deposing them  according to his will  a manifest token of the Beast and openly violating the most sacred  rights  of the Italian CLERGY AND PEOPLE in their  episcopal  elections that he might fill the Italian sees with  Monkish  Prelates who would be more attached to the growing power than  married Bishops  such as were for the most part those of the primi∣tive Church But the particular instance which I propo∣sed to mention was at Rimini in the year where on the death of a Bishop Gregory sent a legate to interfere in the  election  and one Odeatinus a nobleman being never∣theless  elected  Bishop the  Pontif was pleased  PLACU∣ISSET PONTIFICI to command them on pain of  ponti∣fical censure  to place  another person  in the see The man  elected  and  consecrated  for this purpose by Gregory was Castorius who not being  elected  by the people of Rimini was of course thwarted by them and suffered many things by PARTY OPPOSITION the very evil which Gregory pretended to avoid by his MOST PAR∣TIAL  corruption  of the election  ne illam i e  elec∣tionem  STUDIA PARTIUM  corrumperent  for that was his plea for interference Besides this opposition Castorius was grievously afflicted with a distemper in his head on account of which he was invited by the  Pontif  to change the air and visit him at Rome but being even there no better he requested the Pontif that a Pastor might be sent to his church who could better promote the divine service and when the Pontif's hope of Castorius's recovery by the Roman air abated he administered the charge of the church of Rimini by Leontius Bishop of Urbin a second usurpation who was also a Bishop of  his own  appointment In the mean while the sick

 c that it might pass for a deed of King William commonly called the Conqueror but even supposing it to have been authentic yet as it was nei∣ther published nor known till near years after the death of William viz not till the second year of King Richard II anno the  invalidity  of such an instrument to alter  the due process of the law  must be sufficiently obvious at the lastmentioned period

so early as about the middle of the th  cen∣tury  that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues For her  SIN  hath reached unto Heaven and God hath remembered her  INIQUI∣TIES  Rev xviii  who  "hath nothing in Christ"  John xiv  By this miserable forgery the courts of the  congregation  in England were de∣prived of the presence and aid of their  Bishops  in public judgement  This material branch of the Bishop's  duty  as a great  popular  magistrate is clearly proved by Sir Henry Spelman See  "Reliquiae Spelmannianae"  published by Bishop Gibson p  It appeareth by Epipha∣nius  says Sir Henry  that in his time as also many  hundred  years after Bishops and Clergymen did hear and determine causes lest Christians against the rule of the Apostle should go to law under  Hea∣thens  and  Infidels  And it is said in the first Epistle of Clement if it were truly his that St Peter him∣self did so appoint it  And he previously in the same chapter cites a Canon that was ordained A D in concilio Taraconenfi c  That Nullus Episcopus vel infra positus  or official  die Dominico causas judicare praesumat That no Bishop or inferior person presume to judge or try causes on the Lord's day  And in page where he cen∣sures the Bishops of the eleventh and twelfth century who affected to get into their hands the secular power of  counties sheriffwics  and constableships of castles as"  Walter  Bishop of  Durham  " who  having bought the county of  Northumberland  of  William  the Conqueror would needs  sit himself in the County Court  but paid dearly for it for his countrymen furiously slew him even  sitting there  Matt Paris in ann  and "  Hugh  Bishop of  Coventry  " who  exercised the Sheriff's place but was ex∣communicated for it as  contra dignitatem Episc  and so acknowledged his error  Dicetus in ann  To which he immediately adds  But every one will say it was  a common thing in old time for  BISHOPS  to be  JUDGES  in secular courts  I con∣fess it  says Sir Henry  and think it  godly  and  lawful  as it was used at the first For the Bishop and the Earl fat together in the  CountyCourt  the  Bishop  as Chancellor to deliver  Dei rectum  and  popu∣lum docere  the  Earl  as Secular Judge to deliver  rectum seculi  and  populum coercere  as is manifest by the laws of King  Edgar  and others But when the Bishops began to supply both places and to be meer Judges of secular courts then were they  prohi∣hited  by many Canons  This  prohibition  of the  Canons  however had generally a very different object in view from the ostensible or pretended motive of their being ordained I speak of the  later  Canons The  ancient  Canons confirmed the  rights  of the CLERGY and PEOPLE in  episcopal elections marriage  c but some of the  later  Canons on the contrary favoured the encroach∣ments of tyranny and papal apostacy  In the  ancient  Canons commonly called  Apostolical  it is ordained that  if any Bishop Priest or Deacon  c  should abstain from  MAR∣RIAGE FLESH and WINE  not on account of  religious "DIS∣CIPLINE"  or  exercitation  which was only    "for a time that they might give themselves to fasting and prayer"  as allowed by the Apostle Cor vii under an express injunction that married persons should  come together again lest Satan should tempt them  c  through their  natural  "weakness"  it being manifest that such mere  temporary discipline  is alone to be understood in this place "  but through  DEFILEMENT  i e through pretence that  marriage  or  meats  DEFILED the body  forgetful that all things are exceeding good and that  GOD  made  MAN  male  and  female and  viz by this doctrine of defilement  blaspheming the Creator either let him be  REFORMED      or let him be deposed  c  See Canon li And the fifth Apostolical Canon also ordained that  a Bishop  or  Priest  or  Deacon should not put away his wife on pretence of religion  or  piety    But some of the  later  Canons on the contrary invade the most  natural rights  of humanity The Council of Carthage held about the time of Pope Caelestine A D Commanded  Bishops Priests and Deacons to hold chastity  and to  abstain  ETIAM AB UXORIBUS  even from their wives  See Howel's Synop Canonum p So the th Canon of the council held  in Trullo  of the Imperial Palace of Justinian the Second at Constantinople censures the Prelates of Africa and Libya who  after their ordination did  NOT  refuse to live with their own proper wives thereby  say the  infatuated  authors of the Canon "  occasioning offence and scandal to the people  c"and therefore this Canon ordains  "that the like"  ie men living with their  own proper married wives    should  NOT  by any means after that time be done  And the learned Theodore Balsamon Patriarch of Antioch in the twelfth century cites several constitutions of the Emperor Justinian the First which were called  ie  novellae  or novelties an ominous titlewhich or∣dained that a man  was not to be promoted to episcopal dignity who has a wife or children  " a glaring op∣position to the rules laid down in scripture for the choice of a Bishop and again  "that Bishops are to be deposed who dwell with a woman"    See the Paris Edition of Balsamon's Commentary on the Canons p and Thus the Authors of some of the  later Canons  are  marked  with a manifest stain of  apostacy  as men infatuated and deluded by the  wiles of Satan  who holds them  "forth to open shame"  by the evidence of their own Canons as teachers of  "the doctrines of Demons"  viz  "forbidding to marry"  and commanding  "to abstain from meats"  c of which devices and doctrines the Apostle hath given express warning See Tim iv So that the almost universal prevalence of these  open marks  of  apostacy  throughout Christendom against the  express warning of holy scripture  against the strictest cautions of the  ancient apostolic Canons  and even against  nature itself  is so  wonderfully  extraordinary that it would be really  incredible  were not the evidences of it which still exist no∣torious and undeniable The  natural  depravity of mankind tends not to such effects so that we can attribute it only to  supernatural  agents and though many of the boasted  monkish revelations  were really mere  human  forgeries yet I believe that many others were real  apparitions of seducing spirits  in order to hasten the  unnatural apostacy  But with re∣spect to the present points viz the duty of  Bishops  to preside in the  congregational courts  of common law and the people's ancient  right  of judging  ecclesiastical causes  therein the learned SELDEN bears still more ample testimony in his  "Titles of Honour"  P  And the  Scyregemot  which was  says he  a court kept twice every year as the Sheriffs turn is at this day was held by THE BISHOP of THE DIOCESS and  the  EALDORMAN in shires that had  Ealdormen  and by the BISHOPS  and  SHERIFFS in such as were committed to Sheriffs that were immediate to the King And so  says he  both  THE ECCLESIAS∣TICAL  and  TEMPORAL LAWS were TOGETHER  given in charge to the country  The authorities cited by Mr Seldon for this are as follow  Videsis Leg Edgar cap et not ad Edmer pag Historiam nostram de decimis cap § et Leg Canut cap Lambard  Sir Edward Coke has also cited the laws of Edgar to the same purpose in his second Institute p viz  Celeberrimus est omni Sa∣trapia his quotannis conventus agitor cui quidem  ILLIUS DIOECESIS EPISCOPUS  et Senator intersunto quorum alter  JURA DIVINA  alter humana populum edoceto  which also agreeth  says he  with  Magna Charta  and other statutes and continual usage By that which hath been said it appeareth  continues Sir Edward Coke  that the law made by King Henry I was after the great heat of the conquest was past but a restitution of the ancient law of England and forasmuch as  the  BISHOP  with the Sheriffe did go in circuit twice every year by  EVERY HUNDRED within the county c  a  presence  and  aid  of the utmost importance to the  welfare of the  people  and of the whole  commonwealth  whilst the people retained  any share of their just and ancient  right  in  the election of Bishops but little to be regretted when the Bishops through the total perversion of  that right  by the gradual encroachments of monks popes and kings ceased to have that  intimate  connection with the  people  and  their in∣terest  which their predecessors in office were wont to acquire so  naturally  by  popular  elections But the  later  Bishops chosen by the  usurpers  of  episcopal elections  for very different purposes and selected for the most part from the  monastic  or∣ders then falsely called  regular  instead of the  regular  parochial  priesthood  did as  naturally  become the dangerous advo∣cates for very different  interests  the  in∣terests  of their usurping  constituents  whether  monkish  or  monarchical  and more especially about the time of Rich∣ard II when the notorious forgery above∣mentioned was committed  The courts of the  congregation  were also by this detestable forgery cheated of  the power of excommunicating  irreli∣gious and prophane persons from their  own  body or society a  power  most es∣sentially their  own  but which lodged where it is at present merely with the Bishops of a reformed Church who want it not for  undue  purposes like the  papal  prelates neither promotes  episcopal dignity  nor due  ecclesiastical authority  because  eccle∣siastical  judgements and censures by flow∣ing in an improper channel have excited and ever will excite the jealousy of the people and of course they have been generally thwarted and opposed in our courts of  common law  through a just jealousy in the courts of the Bishop's  separate consistories  and have sometimes been reversed and annulled with heavy costs and damages against the  ecclesiastical judge  or perhaps what is worse  against his executors and innocent family after his death by which means the necessary controul of vice and immorality is weakened and  ecclesiastical censures  howsoever just and proper in themselves are but too little regarded by rich and opulent offenders that can spare money for litigation so that the public is grie∣vously injured by infectious examples of depravity without any effectual means of restraining them But it would be far otherwise if the  congregational courts  were restored to their ancient powers of acting by the common law with cogni∣zance of all causes  ecclesiastical  as well as  civil  which formerly they enjoyed as I have already proved For as  law  was deemed  the dictate of reason  "Lex est dictamen rationis" Jenk Cent p  and  "reason"  justly deemed  a ray of the divine light  "Ratio est radius divini luminis" Co Lit b  common  to all men of  common sense  as being derived and in∣herited from our first  common parents  so it followed of course that though many  express laws  for particular occasions and likewise various customs and usages proved by legal precedents formed a part of our  common law  of which the reverend sages of the law and regular students were undoubtedly the pro∣perest judges insomuch that the business of the courts could not be carried on without their assistance yet by far the greatest and most essential part of the common law consisted in the  exercise of reason  duly to discern between  good  and  evil  between  right  and  wrong  between  justice  and  injustice  in all cases whatsoever by the general principles of  natural right  See the st d th and th chapters of Doctor and Student  and by those also which may  be drawn from God's Revelation in the Holy Scriptures which is declared to be the second foundation of our law  See Doctor and Student chap  rs  and  And as the members of a christian community are required by the Scriptures to have their  senses exercised through  HABIT  Heb V  or use  to discern both good and evil  such assemblies with the assistance of the sages and re∣gular students of the law were surely competent to determine whether any offence complained of or presented to them was really either  immoral  in itself or a  nuisance  in any respect to the com∣munity and in either case  the  LAW  will find a remedy  "Lex semper dabit remedium" Prin Leg et Aeq p  be the particular

precedent for proceeding  as at pre∣sent  Justice indeed even at present does not fail for  want of laws  but rather by having  too many  for our  Acts of Parliament  have been multiplied of late years to an  excess  that is almost destructive of their end  excessive  as well in  number  as in tedious  prolixity  for by neglect of the  common law  men are apt to conceive that they have  no remedy  for abuses but  statute  making so that the number of our Acts of Parliament is an∣nually increased though the difficulty of understanding and retaining them in memory regularly increases with the unweildy bulk of the collection and thereby renders them more favourable to  evasion  and  impunity  than to  justice  and  right  more  profitable  to the  venal  talents of perverting orators than  effectual  for the correction of manners Hence arise the difficulty the uncertainty and the intolerable expence of obtaining justice whereby  prudent men  are frequently induced rather to  lose their right  than to risque the expence of defending it in the ordinary course of justice and  violent men  on the other hand are prompted by the difficulty of obtaining justice to revenge their  own  quarrels with their  own  hands Hence  duelling bloodshed  and  murder  which are still farther encouraged by the cor∣rupt modern practice of the courts in laying aside the antient legal discrimination between  manslaughter  and  murder  as I have shewn at large in a distinct tract on that subject printed several years ago in and then sent to  all the judges  but it has not been in the least regarded though I have never had reason to ap∣prehend any error in the performance none having yet ever been pointed out and the modern prevalence of  duelling  proves that the antient doctrine and discipline of the courts which alone I have asserted was cer∣tainly right and necessary to be restored  but the  law  is required to be  effective  Law will rather suffer things against the princi∣ples of law than that a man shall be  without a re∣medy  Grounds and Rudiments p  and all men however great were made to regard it by  amerciaments  or mulcts in proportion as well to the

reinstated in their an∣cient  right  as Christians freely to elect their own Bishops duly observing the  scriptural precautions  against  party  divi∣sions and  tumults  viz First to elect  two

epis∣copal elections more fully stated in my Tract on the Law of Retribution p to I have there proved I hope that the  election of Mathias  to the dignity of an APOSTLE was at the same time a pre∣cedent for  elections  to the office of A BISHOP and that  the unexceptionable apostolic mode of election de∣scribed in Acts  i  was disused indeed during the time that the  apostles  themselves administered the affairs of the church after the great day of Pentecost when the promises respecting  the gift of the  HOLY SPIRIT were visibly accomplished and during the continuance of the outward and  extraordinary  tokens of that  glorious gift  whereby the  apostles manifested  their authority to  APPOINT BISHOPS  without the formulary  PRECAUTIONS  of the first  precedent  but that these just and equitable PRECAUTIONS became once more desirable as soon as the  extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit  I mean only the  outward  manifestation of apos∣tolic power ceased in the Church when the primitive mode of  electing  TWO  unexceptionable presbyters by the people  and referring the appointment of ONE  of them  to the providence of God by the decision of  the lot  ac∣cording to the excellent precedent recorded in Holy Scripture was again revived in several places as being best suited to the  ordinary  state of the church in all suc∣ceeding ages for which I referred to examples testified by good authority in addition to which I have lately discovered amongst the valuable MS collections of the very learned  Dr Tho Mangey  formerly prebendary of Durham which by the Favour of his worthy son the late  Rev Mr John Mangey  my affectionate relation are now in my possession a reference to the council of  Barcelona  held in the Year of Christ wherein the reestablishment of that most cautious and unexceptio∣nable mode of  popular e  ections  was expresly decreed by the bishops of a very considerable providence  "  Tarraconesis provinciae episcopi in urbem Barcinonensem  c"  in Spain  Tarragonia  and by them enjoined as a perpetual usage on the penalty of  deposition  solemnly denounced against all persons that should  presume to act otherwise in future  whether  the ordainers  of bishops or  the ordained  See the d chapter of that council wherein after re∣citing some of the necessary qualifications to render a man eligible to the dignity of a bishop they add  ita

Edition  or congregation or at  least of  all the episcopal communicants in each diocess  that should demand their  right  of suffrage and then after solemn prayer to  decide  BY LOT  before God and the congregation  the appointment of  one  of the  elected  presbyters according to the authentic precedent described in Acts i to the bishops would obtain such a  natural  connection with the  people  as great  popular  officers which they would really be by a  popular  election truly  ecclesiastical  in the true sense of the word  ecclesia  or congregation the surest foundation for  popular  respect and autho∣rity in addition to their proper dignity as being of the highest order of God's ministers in religion that they would effectually become what the Common Law entitles them viz not merely  "robur ecclesiae" the strength of the church  but in a more enlarged sense of the word  ecclesia  including our whole national community or  commonwealth  of Christians "ROBUR REIPUBLICAE"  the strength of the commonwealth  "Ordo Episcoporum est Robur Reipublicae" Jenk Cent p viz  The order of Bishops is the strength  force or hability "of the  commonwealth  " But in order to render this maxim obvious and unques∣tionable we must necessarily imply and include in the  episcopal  function that very important branch of it al∣ready mentioned viz the presiding as chief  popular  ma∣gistrates in the  congregational  courts of common law  See also  Leges Edgari Regis  No and  Leges Canuti Regis  No de Comitus wherein the  Bishop  is expressly required to at∣tend the  Sbyregemot "and thaer teacan ge Godes Ribt"  and there teach the Divine Law  So that the  Bishop's  attendance in the  Shireparliaments  twice every year as well as in national Parlia∣ments is built on the very foundation of the English constitution  and we must also suppose the continuance or reestablishment of the  primitive Christian freedom  in episcopal elections that the Bishops by real  popular  elections may be truly  popular  magistrates worthy to be entrusted with the civil as well as the ecclesiastical INTERESTS  of the com∣monwealth  Mr Sadler in his  "Rights of the Kingdom"  speaking of the time of King Henry II says  It seemeth considerable how all historians of that time and dispute do record  THE CHOICE OF BISHOPS  to be in the  PEOPLE  in  PLEBE and in POPULO  as well as in  CLERO  They mention  RADULPH  ordained a Bishop for the Oreades but rejected by all because not elected by  COMMON ASSENT  of the  PEOPLE PLEBIS CLERO PRINCIPIS 'tis  every where in the old Monks and how the poor Bishop wandered up and down as an as∣sistant to other Prelates  c  See p and more instances also at p The learned author of a Tract printed several years ago as appears by the lift of Tracts published at the same time but without a date intituled  Lex Parliamentaria or a Treatise of the Law and Custom of Parliament  c has cited various proofs of the  People's right  to elect Bishops  That for some years  says he  after this new charter granted in this English Parliament  meaning a Par∣liament held at London by King Henry I  the  PEO∣PLE  were generally  RESTORED  to the right of electing their own magistrates and officers civil military and  ECCLESIASTICAL  and this  says the learned author  I take to be the grand foundation of the  MAGNA CHARTA  of  ENGLISH LIBERTIES i e  as it gave relaxation from  NORMAN  tyranny and slavery And this may teach us that the rights and liberties of the Commons of  ENGLAND  are neither so illegally begotten as by rebellion nor of such tender years as some imagine  c p The continuation of the evidence which I have collected on this head would take up too much room to be inserted  in a note  and therefore I propose to resume the subject in a distinct Tract at the end of this publication  And  though these antient congregational courts have unhappily fallen into disuse yet the  law had duly provided for their continuance by establishing an annual court called  the View of Frankpledge  wherein the association and due arrangement of the whole body of the people in their proper  decinal  di∣visions were intended to be completed  and renewed one of the constant articles of enquiry being whether the  decenaries  were complete  Et fiant Visus de Francoplegio sic quod pax inviola∣biliter observetur et quod DECENNAE INTEGRAE SINT sicut tempore Hen∣rici Regis praedicti esse consueverunt  Fleta lib c  Fleta in this chapter expresly quotes  Magna Charta  and gives a tran∣script of the th chapter of it word for word with very little variation except what may enable us to  correct  the com∣mon printed copies of that noble charter wherein we frequently find the word  "trithinga"  inserted instead of  tithin∣ga  the proper word which is ma∣nifest from the various reading in Fleta of the same import though in the plural number viz  "decennae"  i e  tithings  The English version commonly printed  in the Statute Books has also indeed the word  "trything"  instead of  tithing  and Sir Edward Coke in his commentary on that chapter calls the word three or four times  "trithinga"  though he has copied it right in the chapter itself See his d Inst p    et quod  TI∣THINGA  teneatur integra sicut esse consuevit  c  and let the  TI∣THING  be kept entire as it hath been accustomed to be  I have a copy of Magna Charta printed for the Stationers Company in which has the same true reading    et quod  TITHINGA  teneatur integra  c  and this reading is still farther proved by Sir Edward Coke's commentary upon it  trithinga  or  tithinga  says he  is expound∣ed for  theothinga  which signifieth the  Frankpledge  of  tenne households  c  It is manifest therefore that the  maintaining  the tithings entire  is expressly ordained by Magna Charta so that we have  statute law  the most  respectable statute  that was ever made as well as  common law  to justify the  reestablishment  of the  tithings  throughout the kingdom without having the least need to make a new act for that purpose It is already  the law  and the sheriffs and other ma∣gistrates who do not inforce it by hold∣ing the annual view of  Frankpledge  for the  legal  purpose of  maintaining the ti∣things entire  as directed by  Magna Charta  are certainly deficient in their duty and ought to be duly  amerced  by the crown for their neglect of the most beneficial law both to the king and people that was ever made and the more especially ought they to be  amerced  if any  riots  or notorious robberies shall have happened within their respective jurisdictions du∣ring  the time of their being in office because these in all human probability would have been prevented as well as the damages occasioned by them had the sheriffs done their duty in  completing the tithings  at an  annual View of Frank∣pledge  as the law directs See the whole chapter concerning the  View of Frank∣pledge  and other popular Courts as in∣serted in the common statute books Henrici III cap  No COUN∣TY COURT from henceforth shall be holden but  from moneth to moneth  and where greater time hath been used there shall be greater nor any  sheriff  or his  bailiff  shall keep his  turn  in the HUNDRED but  twice in the year  and no where but in due place and accustomed that is to say  once  after  Easter  and again after the Feast of Saint  Michael  And  the View of  FRANKPLEDGE shall be likewise  at the Feast of Saint  Michael  without occasion So that every man may have his liberties which he had or used to have in the time of King  Henry  our grandfather or which he hath pur∣chased since The  View of  FRANK∣PLEDGE  shall be so done that our peace may be kept  And that the TRYTHING  for TITHING as I have already proved  may be wholly kept  or rather  be kept entire  or  complete  which may easily be done by means of the annual  View of Frankpledge    as it hath been accustomed And that the sheriff seek no occasions and that he be content with so much as the sheriff was wont to have for his  view∣making  in the time of King Henry our grandfather  And perhaps the sheriff's fees for this  "viewmaking"  would be the only part of the business  of  reestablishing  the  tithings  that would need some new regulation  The account of  Frankpledge  given in Dr Cowell's Interpreter is worthy of being recited at length for the sake of those who cannot have recourse to that work  Frankpledge Franciplegium  is compounded  says he  of  Franc  i e  liber  and  pleige  i e  fidejussor  and signifieth in our common law a pledge or surety for freemen For the ancient custome of England for the preservation of the publike peace was that every freeborne man at fourteene yeeres of age after  Bracton  religious persons clerkes knights and their eldest sonnes ex∣cepted should find  surety  for his truth toward the king and his subjects or else be kept  in prison  Mr Lambard also mentions this custom of  impri∣soning  those that could not  find surety  See his Tract on "the Duties of  Constables  " p and I will re∣cite his words beginning with the preceding paragraph for the sake of more fully explaining the nature of  pledges  as well as their association in  tithing  and  hundred  courts After mentioning the cause of associating in  tithing  or decenary companies viz    for the better repressing of theeves and robbers  he adds  these companies be yet in some places of England and namely with us in Kent called BOROES of the saide word BORHES  pledges  or SUERTIE albeit in the Westerne partes of the realme they be commonly named TYTHINGS because they containe as I told you the number of TENNE MEN  with their families  And even as  tenne times tenne  doe make an HUNDRED so because it was then also  appointed that  TENNE OF THESE COMPANIES shoulde at certain times  every three weeks  "Le Hundred Court poit estre tenus ebescun trois semaignes"  See Crompton's "  Authoritie et Jurisdiction des Courts  c" p In ancient times the  Hundred  Court was held every  fifteen days    de Quindena in Quindenam    or once in a fortnight  but was after∣wards altered by a resolution of parliament to clear up some doubts concerning the th chapter of Magna Charta in the reign of Henry III to the time abovementioned viz  de tribus septimanis in tres septimanas  ubi prius teneri solent  de Quindena in Quindenam  c  See Mr Prynne's Brief Animadversions c on the fourth part of the Institutes p and    meete together for their matters of greater waight therefore that generall assemblie or court was and yet is called a HUNDRED Furthermore it was then also ordained that if any man were of so evil credit that he could not get himselfe to be re∣ceived into one of these  tythings  or  boroes  that then hee should be  shut up in prison  as a man  unworthie to live at liberty  amongst men abroad  whereupon  a certaine number of neighbors became customably bound one for another  to see each man of their pledge forthcomming at all times or to answere the transgression committed by any bro∣ken away So that whosoever offended it was forthwith inquired in what pledge he was and then they of that pledge either brought him forth within daies to his answere or satis∣fied for his offence This was called  Frankpledge causa qua supra  and the circuit thereof was called  decenna  because it commonly consisted of  households  and every particular person thus mutually bound for himselfe and his neighbours was called  decennier  because he was of one  decenna  or ano∣ther This custome was so kept that  the sheriffes at every county court did from time to time take the oathes of young ones as they grew to the age of years and see that he were combined in one  dozen  or ano∣ther whereupon this branch of the sheriffe's authority was called VISUS FRANCIPLEGII  View of Frank∣pledge  See  the Statute  What Dr Cowel here calls a  "Statute"  is printed indeed under that  title  in the common Statute Book but it has not in the least respect  the form of a Statute  nor does it appear to be  in reality  any thing more than what the Honourable Mr Justice Barrington has conjectured i e "  This supposed Statute likewise  says he referring to what he had before said of the preceding  nominal  Statute viz  This is most clearly  no Statute  but only an entry made in the  commonplace  of some Lawyer  c  "seems to have been taken"  says he  as well as the preceding one from the notes or common∣place of some lawyer who had occasion to hold a court of Frankpledge  c It contains indeed most of the usual  articles of enquiry  for a court of Frankpledge but I must remark that the th and th articles contain a gross perversion of the antient articles of enquiry concern∣ing  vagrants  viz  Vagrants of whom there was any prae∣sumption or suspicion of evil  c for this necessary object of enquiry is here perverted and altered to serve the purposes of a most detestable oppression  Villenage  to bring  poor labourers  under the usurped authority of the great Lords and landowners as appendages to their estates and mere private property Happily therefore it is  no Statute  I have a copy nevertheless of this false Statute printed in the year the Henry VIII only a little time before the refor∣mation when the whole bulk of all the Statutes at large was con∣tained in a very small pocketvolume little more than half the size of my hand so that this important book was hardly big enough in respect of its size to be deemed even a  manual  though it bears in its titlepage the extraordinary character of containing  more Statutes than ever was imprynted in any one boke before this tyme  and yet even then it contained it seems some  things  falsely called  Statutes  that ought not to have been there I wish the  many weighty folios  were once more reduced to a  single manual  The proper articles of enquiry may be found in Fleta lib ii cap I must acknowledge however that this chapter contains some articles of en∣quiry favourable to the abominable oppression of  ville∣nage  but they are distinct articles from that respecting  vagrants  and as  villenage  is now abolished there can be no occasion to recite them  for  VIEW  OF FRANPLEDGE  made anno    Ed  See  Decennier  From this head I have already in the former part of the work extracted what seemed to be

have already shewn  and swallowed up in the Countie Court  but the  County Court  itself is so far fallen also into disuse through a necessary consequence of neglecting the  Hundreds  or  Wapentaks

particularly to the subject of this book and therefore I think myself obliged to recite it for the sake of those who have not a copy of the o∣riginal In doing this however I pro∣pose to follow the

oathes of allegiance to boys of or even years of age seems very excep∣tionable and therefore I am happy to find that this does not seem to have been originally intended to be required for by the copy of this article in Fleta all that is required of such very young persons is their being entered and pledged in some Decenary  Item si omnes duodecim annorum et ultra sint in Decenna  Enquiry should also be made whether all persons of that age attended the  View of Frankpledge  as they ought See Fleta N  o    Item si omnes  DUODECIM ANNORUM  et ultra venerint sicut debuerint  This corresponds with the d Article of the supposed Statute of th Edward II as expressed in my old Edition of  Et si toutz de  DOUZE ANS  sont en l'assise nostre seigneur le roy et queux ne sont mye et qui les resceite  Which is falsely rendered in the common version viz  And if all the  DOZEINS  instead of all DE DOUZE ANS or of years  "be in the assize of our Lord the King"  the  View of Frankpledge

ha∣ving  taken  and concealed any person in private durance or to  take  the goods of those who had unjustly seized the goods of others until restitution and satisfaction should be made  "Of every wrongful detinue"  or detaining  of the body of a man or other distresse  taking  r  or arrest whether of body or goods      De chescun faux judgement done pur l'autre view en le Hundred ou en le fief  s  In the old version this is rendered  "given by the view in the other Hundred"  which does not sufficiently agree with the original French and there is no coresponding article in  Fleta  to enable me to find a more satisfactory rendering  "Of every false judgement given"  for the other view  •  meaning perhaps a retrospect to the preceding view  in the Hundred or Fee      "De chescun forstall faits en le common chemin"  Of every forestallment done in the common highway      "D' touts torceous vēēs"  t  This word being  ab∣breviated  I can only guess like the former translator at the word intended to be understood  Vēēs  may be an abbreviation for the plural of  veue  the proper French word for  visus  a  view  and may refer to the  "wrongful views"  mentioned in article i e to any  false judgements  that may have been given in the  preceding views "Torceous veues"  may also signify partial or  "favourable inquests taken by the sheriff"  and so also if the word intended should be  venues  torceous  venues  meaning PACKED JURIES or juries not duly chosen out by oath from the proper  vicenage  c whereby the sheriffs were enabled to  replevie  or  bail  malefactors that otherwise were not  bailable  and in this sense the word  "veues"  also answers to the translation given above As a remedy to such  "wrongful views"  or  "favourable inquests"  the th chapter of  Westminster Primer  or Edward I A D cap is ex∣pressly ordained In my old edition of beforementioned it will be found in the chapter And in the th chapter of that edition of the  Primer  in the common edition chap xv particular directions are given to distinguish the several cases wherein  bail  or  replevin  may be lawfully given or lawfully refused and that chapter is copied not only at  length  but even with some  additions  by leta in his useful chapter con∣cerning the  Shiriff's Turns  and  Views of Frankpledge  to which I have such frequent occasion to refer on this subject He also directs a distinct article of enquiry concerning  baitable persons detained and unbailable persons dismissed  See N  o    Item de replegiabilibus injustè detentis et irreplegiabilibus dimissis  "Of"  all  "wrongfull replevies"  i e either for regaining possession of goods that have been duly distreined or for the  bayling  and setting at liberty men that have been duly committed to prison This seems a very  proper article of enquiry  though it is not obvious at first sight how it can be deemed a trans∣lation of the article as expressed in the French copy  t  of  Horn  but in the false  Statute  of Frankpledge  there is an express article for it viz  Des gentes em∣prisonnes et puis lesses sauns garauntie  See N  o  in the English copy of th Edward II  Of persons imprisoned and after let go without mainprise  i e without finding sureties either as  bail  for their appearance or as securities for the peace and their future good beha∣viour      "D' tous torceous rescouses"  u  or  resistance against a lawful authoritie  says Dr Cowell  as for example if a baylife or other officer upon a writ doe arrest a man and another one or more by violence doe take him away or procure his escape this act is called a RESCUS  In the supposed Statute of th Edward II the th article seems to have the same object of enquiry viz  Of escapes of thieves or felons  "Of"  all  "wrongful recousses"  or rescues  u      D' chescun outragious distresse ou en autre fee ou en market pur forrein contract  Of every outragious distresse in another fee  or manour  or in the market for a forraign contract      D' touts  PONTS  rompues et  CAUSIES  et chemins common bridges et qui les doit repaire  See also N  o  in Fleta  Item de  PONTIBUS  et  CALCETIS  fractis  Of all bridges broken and causies wayes common bridges and who ought for to repaire them      w  Des addoubers de viels draps demorrants hors de grands villes en lieux defendues  Des tannors et blancheors d' quirres Et d' main curriers  I have joined these three sentences under one article or head of enquiry because I find them so connected in the supposed Statute of th Ed∣ward II  x  Des vendours des draps et curriours des quirs aillours que en villes marchandes  Of the makers of cloathes dwelling out of great towns in places forbidden  and  of tanners and of curriers of lea∣ther  This article is very different from the French original as well as from Fleta and the supposed Statute of Edward II and it is not easy to trace from any or all of these copies what has been originally intended Accord∣ing to the old copy of the Myrrour it should be  of the dressers  or patchers  of old cloths dwelling  c  w  as if the object was to prevent a secret vamping∣up of old unsaleable or damaged clothes in order to pass them for new In the articles of th Edward II N  o  it is  of clothsellers and curriers of lea∣ther  x  dwelling out of merchanttowns  which I should suppose to respect rather  the  markets  than the  dwellings  of the  clothsellers  and  curriers  viz that all wholesale dealing in  cloths  and  leather  should be at public markets established in great towns like the famous  cloth  markets at Leeds and Halifax and like the great  leather  market in  Leadenhall  that proper market prices may be regu∣larly ascertained and known for the common benefit of the manufacturers as well as merchants  And if this be really the intention of the article it will enable us the better to understand how far a man was formerly prohibited from exercising two several trades viz not any two trades in gene∣ral but only such trades as are so parti∣cularly connected together that the ex∣ercise of both by one man might in some degree affect the public markets and like  forestalling  prevent the fixing of  regular marketprices and even this  limitation  must be  limited  to such trades only which may affect the  necessary arti∣cles of life  for so I think we may un∣derstand the examples recited by Fleta "that the  shoemaker"  and of course all other consumers of  leather  the  sadler  the  breeches  maker the  glove  maker  "shall not be a tanner"  for otherwise the proper marketprice for  leather  could not be so easily ascertained  nor the tanner a butcher  which would in∣jure the  fell  market for  pells  and  hides  and would give him an undue advantage over other tanners  nor the business of a taylor  to be exercised perhaps by a  clothier  or manufacturer of cloth which would injure the  cloth  markets but of this last article I am uncertain for I acknowledge that I do not understand what is meant by the abbreviated words  in the original  See Fleta the same chapter N  o    Item de abbatoribus coreorum praeterquam in civitatibus et burgis et etiam de hiis qui duobus utuntur officiis videlicet sutoriae et tanneriae vel tanneriae et car∣nificis vel officio scissoris et dub' et etiam dub' praeterquam in burgis et locis communibus et plures sunt articuli  and no article of enquiry ought to be formed on a  doubtful  ques∣tion      Des butchers et queux vendont chair suffenne pur sane et gastre pur bien cit  z  Those butchers who  blow up meat with their breath  are presentable accord∣ing to Mr Robert Powell's  treatise of the antiquity authority  c  of the ancient Courts of Lette  c p and of course are  finable  "Of butchers"  and those  who sell unwholesome flesh for that which is sound  And tainted or "spoiled" either through too long keeping or want of cleanliness  z  "for wellconditioned"      "D' ceux qui vendont vine perry pur sanc"  Of all those who sell corrupt wine for sound wine      "Et servoise crue ou rousse ou de feves"  or made of beans  ou deceraie"  perhaps for de cerelle a sort of perry  "pur covenable et sane"  "And"  of those who sell  "beer"  or  ale raw and not well brewed for that which is good and wholsome      "Des mennes larcines"  In the articles of th Edward II some particular kinds of petty thefts are specified N  o    Des petitz larons come des owes selyns ou garbez  N  o    Des larons queux sakent draps ou garbes  Which in the common version are rendered  N  o    Of pety larons as of geese hens or sheafs  N  o    Of thieves that steal clothes or of thieves that do pilfer clothes  to which the translator has added  "through windows or walls"  as if he understood  "garbes"  to bear a different sense from  garbez  in the preceding sentence signifying  gerbes  or  sheaves  of corn but to mean literally  garbes  garments clothes shirts or any part of our  garbe  or dress which thieves might be tempted to pilfer from open  windows walls  c Fleta has this article of  petty larciny  but he has prefixed to it the article of  cutters of purses  whose crime when they do not fail in the attempt can seldom be ranked as  petty larciny  unless we may use the term of  cutpurse  to be applicable to all those petty villains whom we commonly call  "pickpockets"  See Fleta N  o    Item de scisso∣ribus bursarum et latronibus de modicis latrociniis aucarum  of geese  "garbarum"  of sheaves  "pannorum"  of clothes  "et hujusmodi"  "Of small larcines"  or thefts commonly called  "petit larceny"  when the goods stolen do not exceed the value of twelvepence      "Des scissors de burses"  "Of cutters of purses"      "D' ceux qui les suffrent user lour mestier pur loier" "Of those who suffer"  other  persons to exercise their trade for hire  This perhaps may relate to the several particular branches of trade beforementioned in p and  two  of which cannot lawfully be exerci∣sed by any one person for the reasons before assigned And this article may be intended to deter tradesmen in any of these branches from permitting tradesmen of different branches from carrying on the prohibited union of trades in their name for hire  Of those who suffer people to use any mysterie for reward or fee      "D' pernors d' thefeboot"  probably the same kind of persons may be intended by  the redeemers of robbery  mentioned in Fleta See N  o    Item de redemptoribus latrocinii  "Of receivers of thiefboot"  i e receivers of  "stolen goods"      "D' sesors et hauntors d' faux dice"  Of makers and haunters of false dice      "D' outrageous tolners"  "Of outrageous toletakers"  i e those who take more  toll  than the law directs      "D' touts trecheors et deceivers"  "Of all other"  cheaters or trick∣ers and  "deceivers"      "D' touts manners conspirators"  "Of all manner of conspirators"      Et de touts autres articles qui valer purront a pecher destruer  This article must of course in∣clude all the other articles mentioned by Fleta and also in the articles of Edward II though they are not particularly mentioned in the  Myrrour  Also of the breakers of goals the ravishers of women and the seducers of wives and of nuns  or single women N  o    Item de fractoribus goalarum rap∣toribus mulierum et abductoribus uxorum et monalium  In the articles of th Edward II  N  o    Of women ravished not presented before the coroners  De rape de feme qui n'est my present devant le coroner  Which should rather be rendered  Of the rape of woman which is not presented before the coroner  This in∣cludes not only the detestable acts of violence which alone is expressed by the former rendering but also the seduction or carrying off a minor even with her own consent which in law is deemed a  rape  because of the nonage The old Saxon laws punished every lascivious affront or impudent incivility to women which might be deemed a leading step to greater injuries by pro∣portionable  amerciaments  which the  CourtLeets  and  Views  may surely resume if they please in favour of  morality  to vindicate the just rights of modest women and to promote honourable marriage which is notori∣ously hindered by the prevalence and facility of whore∣doms and by the general neglect of doing justice to poor injured helpless girls  It is unreasonable and unnatural that all the difficulties and ill consequences of temptation between the youth of both sexes should be cruelly laid upon the  weaker vessel  whereby she is too often irrecove∣rably loft and added to the pitiable swarms of wretched female sedu∣cers to revenge her injury on the other sex by the communication of a loathsome disease till her wretched career in the service of Satan is closed by a miserable and hopeless death The  marriage act  has greatly added to the promotion of these evils by taking away the force of contracts and other circumstances of the  common law  that was favourable to the cases of injured young women and this merely to indulge the unreasonable pride of families▪  by punishing their se∣ducers who in ancient times would have been com∣pelled to marry them  The coroners were particularly required to vindicate the rights of females by enquiring after  rapes  as ap∣pears by the last quotation from the articles of th Edward II This circumstance is not mentioned in Fleta though we there find a distinct article respecting coroners in which however this crime as being a  felony  must necessarily be included  Item de feloniis quorum clamor non pervenit ad coronatores    Also concerning  FELONIES  the cry of which did not reach the  CORONERS  The  rights  of the crown ought also to be enquired after at the  torns  of the sheriffs and at  Views of Frankpledge  and undoubtedly also at other  Leets  not only of  alienations  of land c but also of  escheats  of every kind and of the  fines amerciaments  and other profits of these popular courts which how∣soever they may have been granted to private lords of manours may always be resumed according to the true  legal  doctrine of  "nullum tempus occurrit Regi"  as  res fiscalis  a branch of the public revenue which ought never to be sold or transferred by any King to another person being  res quasi sacra quae dari non potest nec vendi nec ad alium transferri a principe vel a Rege regnante  whereas it is otherwise in the alienation of  lands tenements  c in which  tempus currit contra Regem sicut contra quamlibet privatam personam  as I have shewn in a distinct tract on that doctrine But the  more sacred  branches of the public revenue those which are properly  res fiscalis  should be carefully enquired after for if they were duly levied and paid into the exchequer to the public accompt they would considerably augment the national treasure without  burthening  the people nay they would be really on the contrary  profitable  to the people not only in a  moral  sense by restraining vice of every kind but also in  pecuniary  advantage by lowering the  poor's rates  and by aiding the national treasury in so essential a manner as would render less taxes necessary  The d article in Fleta charges the  Leet  juries with the conservation of the rights of the crown  Et si in  TURNIS VICOMITIS  vel  VISIBUS HUNDREDARUM  tunc sic de jure regis relato vel alienato in terra vel in mari per quem fuerit alienatum vel celatum et a quo tempore  Notice should also be taken of any  new  customs or usages set up either in land or water See Fleta N  o    Item de  NOVIS  consuetudinibus in terra vel in aqua levatis  To which should also be added a strict enquiry after  old customs  and  usages  withdrawn especially of those which were due to the  popular  courts See the articles of th Edward II N  o    Of cus∣toms and services due to this court withdrawn how and by whom and in what bailiff's  or hundreder's  "times"  There are a few other circumstances of en∣quiry peculiar to the articles of th Edward II viz  "De ceux queux vount en message dez larons"  See N  o  in the common version  Of such as go in message for thiefs  N  o    "Of clippers and forgers of money"  fauseours de la money rather  falsisiers  of money N  o    "Of such as continually"  rather  "assiduously"  "assiduelement"  haunt taverns and no man knoweth whereon they do live  or  "from whence this"  expence  "comes" "et home ne syet dount ceo vint"  N  o    Of such as sleep by day and watch by night and fare well and have nothing  N  o    Of such as flie unto church or churchyard and after depart without doing that which belongeth thereunto  The latter part of this sentence is differently expressed in the original viz  "Et puis sen vount sauns faire l'assesse"  Churches and churchyards no longer afford protection to delinquents but there are still some  priviledged places  which should be so regulated as not to afford a temporary shelter to debtors c merely to enable them to illude  "the due process of the law"  and then to escape without making any proper advances towards satisfying the law "  sauns faire l'assesse  " which I suppose should rather be  l'assise  i e without demanding a due enquiry into their case by  inquest  or  assise  of a  jury  The priviledge should afford them indeed a short temporary asylum from any single merciless credi∣tor yet not so as to favour their escape but merely to give them time to call their other just creditors toge∣ther in order to make an equal division as far as their effects will go after giving up  all  upon oath and then to be absolutely at liberty by the  common law  without fear of farther arrest if there is no just suspicion of conceal∣ment The  "due process of the law"  is sacred and ought not to be baffled nor even  delayed  in any other manner than what I have described by abuses of  privi∣ledged places  and therefore all  CourtLeets  or  trithings  are competent as being  "Courts of the King"  to vindicate the  law  and to limit the asylum of  privi∣ledged places  within reasonable bounds so as to  relieve  oppressed debtors without  violently injuring  the  just rights  of creditors The old common law custom beforementioned in behalf of debtors viz that they should be absolutely relieved from the fear of arrest by giving up all their effects upon oath amongst their creditors was called in the North of England  "swearing themselves bare"  and I remember some instances of it several years ago but whether it is still in use I do not know it is however a  reasonable  usage which under the regulation of  CourtLeets  were they universally revived might prevent the  imprisonment  and consequent  ruin  of many useful and industrious members of society The only circumstance remaining to be cited from the articles of th Edward II is N  o    Of such as take doves in winter by doorfalls or engines  Doorfalls  are not mentioned in the original but  "laces"  for  lacets  nooses or  snares  Some other very necessary subjects of enquiry are mentioned by Fleta though omitted in all the other lists of articles viz concerning  all neglects in keeping watch and ward  and concerning the King's highways not duly widened N  o    Item de vigiliis non observatis et viis rega∣libus non elargatis  And lastly all the  other articles having been already cited    Item de hiis qui retinuerint probatores    Also of those who had re∣tained provers  or as they were commonly called  "approvers"  An approver  signifieth in our common law  says Dr Cowell  one that confessing felony of himselfe appealeth or accuseth another one or more to be guilty of the same and he is called so because hee must  PROOVE  that which hee hath alleadged in his appeale  Staunf pl cor fo  And that proofe is by battell or by the countrey at his election that appealed  c And whilst the barbarous and un∣reasonable custom of  "trials by battle"  continued a hardened villain that was skilful at cudgeling could bear a hearty drubbing had it in his power if it be true that the  appellor  had the election of the kind of trial and not the  appellee  to compel any honest man that happened to be weaker than himself either to risque the misfortune of an unequal combat or to lose his land and fly the country An enquiry therefore after the  retainers  and encouragers of such dangerous knaves was highly necessary in ancient times but the  approvers  of the present times i e those culprits who turn  King's evidence  to save their own necks cannot now endanger the life of an honest man in trials  by the country  unless the jury be extremly ignorant or partial because such men who have already confessed their own crimes cannot justly be deemed  credible wit∣nesses  so that their information is of no other avail or weight than as it may lead to more substantial evidence And besides the crimes already mentioned every other act of injustice or vice whatsoever and even mere  immo∣ralities  as I before remarked are within the cogni∣zance of the  CourtLeets  or  Trithings  which are com∣petent in themselves to  find a remedy  for every  incon∣venience  without fearching for acts of parliament because the latter were  intended  at least to aid and promote  justice  and not to take away or lessen the  just  power of the ancient courts in suppressing  vice  and  im∣morality  The pecuniary penalties however ordained by statutes against various crimes and misdemeanors may afford to the Juries of  Leets  some information respecting what may be deemed an adequate  amercia∣ment  but it cannot be levied by virtue of the statute unless there is also an express clause giving power to  Leets  for that purpose like the Statute of James I c against  drunkenness  but as this I believe is very seldom the case it is better to proceed entirely by the authority of the  common law  in all cases wherein it is not expressly altered or changed by statute With respect to  drunkenness  a vice which generally precedes  most other vices  and cannot therefore afford the least colour of excuse to  any  but is rather to be deemed an aggravation to the guilt of  all  vices every circumstance of it ought to be strictly enquired after and the de∣faulters should be regularly  amerced  without remission that they may want  money  at least though they do not want inclination for that  damnable  Be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adul∣terers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous NOR DRUNKARDS nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God  Cor vi also Gal v  vice Profane  swearing  and  cursing  and also every idle or heedless mention of God's holy name should be duly  mulcted  at the CourtLeet without  respect of persons  either of rich or poor except in a due proportion of the  amerciaments  to their  respective  abilities of paying that the  penalties  may be  felt  and regarded by offenders of all ranks so that the  justice  of the Court may be  equal  and  effectual  By a statute of Eliz c some other articles of enquiry are submitted to the cognizance of court leets viz  If any person hath built or caused to be built any manner of cottage for habitation or dwelling or convert∣ed any other building to be used as a cottage  for habita∣tion or dwelling without assigning or laying to the same cottage or building four acres of ground at the least c lying near to the said cottage to be con∣tinually occupied and manured therewith so long as the same cottage shall be inhabited  The forfeit or penalty is l to the King and the up∣holding maintaining and continuing any such cottage is s for every month The act does not extend to cottages erected  in any city town corporate or ancient borough or market town c  nor to cottages  for the necessary and convenient habitation or dwelling of workmen or labourers in any mineral works coal mines quarries or delfs of stone or slate or in or about the ma∣king of brick tile lime or coals within this realm so as the same cottages or buildings be not above one mile distant from the place of the said mineral c  nor  to any cottage to be made within a mile of the sea or upon the side of such part of any navigable river where the admiral ought to have jurisdiction so long as no other person shall therein inhabit but a sayler or man of ma∣nual occupation to or for making furnishing or vic∣tualling of any ship or vessel used to serve on the sea  nor  to any cottage to be made in any forest chace warren or park so long as no other person shall therein inhabit but an underkeeper or warrener c  nor  to any cot∣tage heretofore made so long as no other person shall therein inhabit but a common herd man or shepherd for keeping the cattle or sheep of the town or a poor lame sick aged or impotent person  nor  to any cottage to be made which for any just respect upon complaint to the justice of assize at the assizes or to the justices of peace at the quarter sessions shall by their order entered in open assizes or quarter sessions be decreed to continue for ha∣bitation for and during so long time only as by such decree shall be tolerated and limited  But cottages  "builded upon commons or waste grounds"  were allowed only  three acres  to be enclosed to and with the same and if  there be above the number of three acres enclosed therewith the overplus shall or may be laid open by the owner or owners of the same wastes  c  See d and th Edw VI c  And inclosed  gardens orchards  or  ponds  made in any such wastes or grounds are permitted by the last men∣tioned act to remain to the owners if they exceed not the quantity of two acres § v vi  We must necessarily understand that the permission in these two clauses could not have been intended to ex∣tend to parts of commons or wastes that have been clan∣destinely joined by inclosures to any neighbouring free∣hold land for the latter is notorious incroachment or pu  presture on public rights by  land owners  who on account of the land they already possess are the least intitled to such an indulgence  The court leet should also enquire  If there be any inmate or more families or households than one dwelling or inhabiting in any one cottage  In which case the owner or occupier of the cottage forfeits to the lord of the leet s  for every month that any such inmate or other family than one shall dwell or inhabit in any cottage as aforesaid  c See the before cited act of Eliz c which gives full power to court leets  to enquite and to take presentment by the oath of jurors of all and every offence in this behalf  i e  respecting cottages c    and upon such presentment had or made to levy by distrest to the use of the lord of the leet all such sums of money as so shall be forfeited  c  We are farther informed by  Fleta  in the chapter be∣fore cited viz lib ii c that  when the  CHIEF PLEDGES  shall have answered distinctly  says he  Cum autem  Capitales Plegii  ad haec capitula distinctè responde∣rint non solum est eorum veredicto fioes adhibenda verumetiam sa∣cramento et veredicto duodecim liberorum hominum qui super in∣dictamentis

quia concessum est omnibus libertatem visus francii plegii habentibus quod sui liberi tenentes vel alii liberi ad visus suos sectatores in turnis et visibus jurent non obstante ullo reglo mandato vel graviter pro contemptu amercientur eo quod DIES REGIS EST ET IN FAVOREM PACIS FUIT INVENTUS  to  these various heads or articles belief is due not only to their verdict but also to the oath and verdict of twelve freemen who upon the said indictments and also upon the said concealments are charged to declare the truth nor can they be excused from their oath by  EXCEPTION  which  is  not without the kings writ because that  NO EXCEPTION  will have place on that day for to all that have the liberty of  VIEW OF FRANKPLEDGE  it is granted that their own  FREE TENANTS and OTHER FREEMEN SUITORS TO THEIR VIEWS  or inquest  shall swear'  act upon oath  in  TURNS  and  VIEWS  notwithstanding any royal mandate  to the contrary  or they shall be heavily amerced for the contempt because that it is  THE KING's DAY  i e the day on which the  great leet after Michaelmas  is held for the  view of frankpledge  is to be deemed the  king's day  and  IT WAS INVENTED IN FAVOUR OF the common PEACE  And of all other articles availe∣able for the destruction of offenders  "And the presentments are to be sealed"  continues the author of the Myrrour  with the seales of the jurours so that none by fraud doe increase or diminish  them and that which cannot be re∣dressed there by these presentments is presentable at the shiriffes first turne and those things which the sheriffes cannot redresse are to be presented by the sheriffes into the exchequer  All those who are presented for any offence which is mortall and banished persons who are returned and their receivers and those who are not in allegiance under the King are to be seised upon and their goods to be seised into the King's hands  And although it be so that the bailiffe cannot heare and determine any action  AT THE LEETE  in the original it is "A LA TORNEE"  neverthelesse if any one present be grieved by any  wrong full presentment and complain thereof or if the Bayliffe or Steward have a suspition that the Jurours be in some case perjured by concealing of any  offence which is presentable or of any offender it is lawfull for the Bayliffes  or Stewards  by twelve more discreet men  in the original  per  xii  plus vaillant  "more courageous"  or "more worthy"  to enquire of the truth thereof without delay and although that the last Jurours  should  say that the first are perjured neverthelesse be∣cause  that no  DECENERY  in the original TESTIMONY "  or Jurour  IS NOT ATTESTABLE" in the original N'EST ATTEINTABLE is not attaintable  with lesse than  TWO JURYES  and because the latter  JURIE  is not taken but  EX OFFICIO  of the Bayliffe and not in the nature of an attaint the first  Jurours are  NOT  to be taken  ATTAINT∣ED  but are only to be  AMERCED  And if any one profer himselfe to sweare fealty to the King he is first to  be  PLEDGED  in some  FRANCKPLEDGE  and put into the  DECENERY    mise en  DIZEIN  placed in a Decenary the French word DIZEIN for a  Decenary  being manifestly the root of the word  dozen  which now bears a very different sense  "ana"  be  afterwards sworne to the King and then he is sobidden to  offend and common  i e commune  with offenders and he is to be enjoyned to be obedient to his  CHIEFE PLEDGE  CHIEF PLEDGE ie The  captain of ten  the elected chief of the  ten deciners  by whom the newlyadmitted stranger is to be  pledged  if he is not a  householder  but only a  lodger  a  journeyman  or a  servant  but with whom he is to be  associated  and numbered as a  deciner  if he has qualified himself for it by becoming a  householder  And to take this oath in these  VIEWS  is none exempted who is past the age of    yeeres  a transposition of these Figures  viz    I have already remarked that years seems too tender an age for persons to be required to  take the oaths  though it is certainly very proper that all persons of that age should appear at  the view  to be publicly admitted as members of the community and to be arranged under the protection of some  decenary  of associated housekeep∣ers in order to be duly  pledged  to the public peace  Bracton  as I have before remarked mentions the age of years perhaps or when youths are more capable of bearing arms would be a more reasonable age or even the  transposed  number  is the number expressed in the original  man or woman  By this it plainly appears that all young  girls  above years of age as well as  youths  are required to ap∣pear at the  view of frankpledge  and of course are liable to be  fined  for nonattendance  Married women  are ex∣cused by the law but have surely a right to attend with their daughters if they think it proper to do so  clerke nor layman except alliens strangers messen∣gers or merchants and those who are in custody  At these Views of Turnes and Views of Frankpledges  ESSOIGNES HOLD  "TIEN LIEU ESSOIGNES" essoines take place or are to be admitted  where the absence of those who cannot be there is excusable and such  ESSOINES  are ad∣journable  to the next courts following  that the ESSOINERS  have    "eyent"  may have "  their  WARRANTS"  Thus it is manifest that the law requires all persons to attend  the view of Frank∣pledge  and renders them liable not only to the censure of that court but also to be  amerced  if they neglect to attend and have not a reasonable excuse or legal  essoin  to justify their absence so that if sheriffs and other persons who have ju∣risdiction of  leets  were but convinced of the general utility of  tithingassociations  they have already ample powers to rees∣tablish them in their respective districts And if the whole body of the people both men and women were thus regularly and systematically arranged in their pro∣per divisions all riots mobbing and il∣legal obstruction at  elections  and on other occasions of popular concourse might be  I e  proper Certificates of a legal excuse or admissi∣ble reason for their absence from the  View of Frankpledge  easily prevented and the obscure sons of violence and anarchy might be most ef∣fectually restrained and by the facility of discovery be rendered  "forthcoming"  and personally responsible for all misde∣meanors and even for such impertinencies and immoralities as ought to be curbed because every single  unit  of our national  millions  of inhabitants together with his or her communication and manner of li∣ving might then be easily  traced  as to a given point throughout all the regular gradations of  shires thousands hundreds fifties tithings  and  families  even to the very chamber of the sculking delinquent For whether a country be more or less po∣pulous it makes no difference in the ef∣ficacy and regularity of this system because the proposed numerical divisions would still bear the same proportions exactly with respect to each other in either case viz whether the people be few or many  And the lesser divisions of  tithings  are so small and manageable that every  indivi∣dual  as well as every  family  therein may be easily known and controuled by their elected  ChiefPledges  who with their whole divisions are again included and controuled in still larger divisions equally well proportioned under  superior chiefs  or  justiciaries  And these  justiciaries  in∣vested with ample power of  law  and  right  are so limited with respect to  tort wrong  or  injury  that they have no authority to act contrary to  common consent  nor to pro∣ceed against any man without  "due process of the law"  though they have effectual means of information concerning the abode and general circumstances even of the meanest individual throughout all the  tithings  by their nearest neighbours and acquaintance For when the tithing are properly regula∣ted with their superior divisions each Ti∣thing may truly be said to be  as it were a  wheel in the middle of a wheel  Ezek i and more especially so when the  ro∣tation of watch and ward  and of other pub∣lic service is duly  circulated  throughout all the divisions of a whole nation for such  "wheels"  are indeed  full of eyes round about  Ezek x eyes to convey information and complete knowledge in all popular concerns whatsoever as I have elsewhere observed on the word  che∣rubim  See Tracts on  "National Defence by a Free Militia"  p and  so that the most obscure offender cannot escape the justice of the commu∣nity whenever he is duly indicted and sought  If this ancient form of popular govern∣ment was duly established it would also regulate with the utmost precision the rights of all  electors  and would com∣pletely obviate the specious  objections  against  Parliamentary Reformation  that have lately been published in a little  tract intituled "  Thoughts on a Parlia∣mentary Reform  This celebrated Tract  little  as it is in bulk hath still  less  of truth and justice in its positions and conclu∣sions so that after paying all due respect to  the singular wit and humour  of the writer we must necessarily deem it as  superficial  and  groundless  as it is  short  but it is ne∣vertheless rendered important and considerable by the great circulation and public notice with which it hath been honoured for though the author did not think proper to prefix  his name  the booksellers it seems have made no secret of it and the work has been industrious∣ly retailed by piecemeal in the news papers and has therein been publicly attributed to a certain facetious old gentleman of rank and consequence in the polite world and also of considerable celebrity as a writer by which circumstances we may easily account for the extraordinary ready sale and circulation of such a work  " for it would most cer∣tainly afford the effectual means of main∣taining perfect peace during the time of  elections  and would render the polling of the electors be they ever so numerous not only  practicable  but perfectly easy and free from confusion even if the li∣mitations of the  right of voting  were drawn out to the most liberal extent that has yet been proposed even according to the  plan  which this author  ironically  de∣clares he  "prefers to all the rest"  viz  that of giving a right of voting universally together with annual elections  This is the plan which he says  appears to be the most uniform consistent and effectual  but then he quaintly adds  it has indeed one capital defect which is that it is absolutely and utterly im∣practicable c  Now if this was as  true  as it is  witty  the state of the nation would indeed be desperate for if the  "most effectual"  plan of reformation was really  impracti∣cable  any attempt whatever to correct the enormous  inequality  or  inequity  of the national representation and its conse∣quent  ruinous venality  and manifold  de∣structive corruptions  would indeed be hopeless and we should of course be obliged to embrace this author's forlorn and  disloyal  doctrine in p which  may truly be said to express the scope and drift of all his arguments because they are for the most part  deistically  In a wellintended work of the same celebrated au∣thor wherein  Deistical  notions ought not to have ap∣peared without their antidote we may find several very heterodox and dangerous positions stated as the re∣marks of  "some speculative and refined observers"  viz that to such persons  "it has appeared incredible"  say he  that a wise and benevolent Creator should have con∣stituted a world upon one plan and a religion for it on another  c c p dly That  the love of power riches honour and fame are the great in∣citements to generous and magnanimous actions yet by this institution  meaning the christian religion  "are all these depreciated and discouraged"  p dly That  government is essential to the nature of man and  CANNOT  be managed without certain degrees of  VIO∣LENCE CORRUPTION  and  IMPOSITION  yet are all these strictly forbid  ibid thly That  nations  CANNOT  subsist without wars nor wars be carried on without rapine desolation and murder yet are these prohibited under the severest threats  p and thly That  the nonresistance of evil must subject indi∣viduals to continual oppressions leave nations a defence∣less prey to their enemies yet is this recommended  c c c And at last he renders himself answerable for these pernicious and contradictory positions by in∣discriminately adopting them all and making them his  own  saying  To all this I answer that such indeed is the Christian Revelation though some of its advocates may perhaps be unwilling to own it and such  says he  it is constantly declared to be by him who gave it as well as by those who published it under his immediate direction  But happily for mankind and the honour of our holy reli∣gion the texts which he has cited to justify his assertion contain nothing that can possibly afford the least sanc∣tion to any such doctrines and contradictions That  world  which our Saviour spoke of as being in opposi∣tion to  him  and  his  could not mean  the world constituted upon the plan of the Creator  but only the wickedness of  worldly men  such as the apostle Paul has particularly de∣scribed in his second epistle to Timothy ch iii v  Lovers of their ownselves covetous boasters proud  c c c  Lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God having  A FORM OF GODLINESS BUT DENY∣ING THE POWER THEREOF  from such  said the apostle  "turn away"  manifestly giving the very same advice which appears in one of the texts cited by this writer "  Be not conformed to this world  Rom xii  " i e to the man∣ners and unprofitable pursuits of such  worldly  men as I have described in the words of the apostle for of such is surely formed that  world which is at enmity with God  mentioned in another of the texts cited by him from the apostle James Nay that  Cor ii Jom iv  wisdom of the world which is at enmity with God  cannot be illus∣trated by more flagrant examples than these very posi∣tions which our author has unguardedly adopted from  "some speculative and refined observers"  and more espe∣cially the third that  government cannot be managed without violence corruption and imposition  which I propose more particularly to examine because it is a  political  doctrine too generally adopted by  placemen  and  pensioners  and which is manifestly the very principle or essential spirit which pervaded and has notoriously in∣fluenced every page of our author's  Thoughts on a Parliamentary Reform  His  first  position is materially connected with the  third  and will of course fall un∣der the same examination With respect to his  second  position I shall briefly remark that though  the love of power riches honour and fame are  indeed most commonly  the great inoitements to generous and magna∣nimous actions  yet for the honour of human nature these are not to be deemed the  only  incitements because the MOST  "generous"  and the MOST  magnanimous actions  have much more noble  incitements  than he has conceived viz the  love of God  and the  natural love  of  justice  and  right  so that his position proves nothing against the merit of actions that are  truly  and  perfectly generous  And besides these worthy  incitements  the agency or influence of GOD's HOLY SPIRIT is also to be deemed an  incitement to generous and magnanimous actions  nay it is certainly the highest  incitement  or the  supreme principle of action in man  by which  all  christians  ought  to be influenced and most certainly  may  be so if they do not neglect the promised  means  This I trust is amply proved in my tract on  the Law of Nature  c  The  fourth  and  fifth  positions are grounded on a strange misunderstanding of the true doctrine concern∣ing  nonresistance  for though we are indeed required to forgive  personal injuries  and to submit to them with christian meekness when any one of  ourselves  is indivi∣dually the sufferer nevertheless we are most certainly bound in christian duty to  resist evil  and  injury  whenever the  persons  or  property  of  other  men are in danger and to defend  each other  from all unjust  violence  and  ra∣pine  whenever it is in our power to do so and that even at the risk of our lives which I have fully stated in my tracts on  Crown Law  and  Passive Obedience  And if individuals may legally and consistently with their duty as christians  resist evil  in defence of  each other  surely a whole christian community or  nation  may most conscientiously be allowed in their united legislative or executive capacity a power of  defending the innecent  and of  resisting evil  and  oppression  for this is the true foundation of all  just wars  which certainly in the necessary defence of a  nation  may be carried on without the guilt of  rapine  and  murder  since even be∣tween  individuals  the  inevitable killing  of an adversary in the necessary defence of a man's own person is clear∣ly  justifiable  in  law  as well as in  reason  which is the  eternal  law of God And  national justice  in many cases is unquestionably required to  resist evil  even unto  blood  The blood of the murderer i e of the  voluntary killer of a  MAN is absolutely required to be shed by MAN  "by man shall his blood be shed"  Gen ix and a moral reason is elsewhere assigned for this retaliation by  man  viz  for blood it desileth the land and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein but by the blood of him that shed it  Num xxxv And this surely is a  resistance to evil  a retaliation of  violence in kind  even to the utmost extremity of  violence  to death This however must be understood only of  judicial acts  of retaliation duly limited in all their circumstances by the established laws of the  community  or nation which inhabits  the land where the blood is shed  but under such due restriction the retaliation of  blood  for  blood  is so far from being forbid that the land it is manifest cannot be  cleansed  without it The indiscriminate doc∣trine therefore of  non resistance  as stated in these two positions has no foundation in scripture nor indeed any where else except in the  misunderstanding  and inac∣curacy of these  speculative  and  refined observers  I may now return to the consideration of his third position that  government is essential to the nature of man and  CANNOT  be managed without certain degrees of  VIOLENCE CORRUPTION and IMPOSITION  yet all these are strictly forbid  The first part of this sen∣tence as well as the last must certainly be admitted as unquestionable  truths  but if the middle part of the proposition were equally  true  viz that government "CANNOT  be managed without violence imposition  " c it would follow of course that the  necessity of the case  must regularly supersede all that is so  strictly forbid  concerning it and then indeed these  spe∣culative  and  refined observers  would have a better foundation for their impious insinuation that the  Crea∣tor hath  constituted a world upon one plan and a reli∣gion for it on another  Nay I have frequently heard these very principles avowed in conversation by some other  such "friends to good government"  as our author in terms to the following effect  That public business cannot be carried on without  BRIBERY and CORRUP∣TION  that the measures of administration are indis∣pensably  NECESSARY  to maintain due subordination and  GOOD GOVERNMENT  and must not therefore be im∣peded by unseasonable negatives of parliament so that  POLITICAL NECESSITY  will sufficiently justify the statesman in exerting all possible influence to obtain a majority at any rate  Thus the plea of NECESSITY is introduced to  palliate  and excuse nay even to  jus∣tify  and  establish  the most flagrant enormities as if  in∣equity  was become an essential principle of government so authorized and  established  by the sanction of  general usage  that every attempt to correct it must be deemed an  innovation to the constitution  In no other point of view can be understood the falla∣cious and groundless charge of INNOVATION which has regularly been opposed to  parliamentary reform  by men of  a certain description  whenever it hath been proposed With these  latitudinarians in principle  all distinctions between  right  and  wrong  must be measured by  political expediency  because  government  according to them  cannot be managed without certain degrees of violence corruption and imposition  Thus the celebrated wri∣ter hath very honestly stated the  ruling  maxim of that  venal majority  with whom he always  voted  and  associated  And as these  "speculative and refined observers"  have carried this wretched system of  political necessity and ex∣pediency  to the utmost extent that it was capable of I have need only to cite their own  woeful experience  as a most striking and undeniable example of its absurdity  The INIQUITY of these acknowledged means of  "managing government"  viz  violence corruption and imposition  added to the MISCARRIAGES which such worthy  ministerial accomplishments  have of late years no∣toriously occasioned would form too heavy a burden for one broad back I speak therefore of the late  governing  majority in the aggregate and shall not be tempted to particularize unless any of them should still persist in soliciting and inviting as it were the national justice against themselves for their former misconduct when in power by any farther unreasonable and  pro∣voking  opposition to the necessary  reformation  Under the baneful auspices of these justifying Majori∣ties and their  Managers  the Patrons and Friends of this writer with the sanction also of his  own steady vote  in all their measures the most disgraceful and per∣nicious excess of "  violence corruption  and  imposition  " has been tried and pushed to the utmost exertions of the national strength and resources and at an expence of blood and treasure far beyond all example of former times  And yet the detestable  experiment  has notoriously failed in almost every circumstance proposed to be effected by it and instead of  raising a revenue  to gratify and ease  "the country gentlemen"  has  sunk  the national resources in a hopeless  gulph of debt  the very interest of which is an  annual  expence of more than the value of an em∣pire i e  a revenue by the rule of inverse against  the state like the  "negative quantity"  of the algebraists  "less than nothing"  a  "minus"  of eight millions per annum at least besides a most disgraceful dismember∣ment of the British empire So much for the EXPE∣RIENCE of the  "speculative and refined observers"  There are many maxims indeed which seem to favour the plea of  necessity  as  "Necessitas non habet legem"  "NECESSITY  has no law  "    Necessitas facit licitum quod alias non est licitum  Necessity makes lawful what otherwise is not law∣ful  "Salus populi suprema est lex"  "The safety of the people"  which even bad ministers will pretend to regard  "is the supreme law"  "Necessitas vincit legem"  "Necessity binds the law"    Necessitas legum vincula ir∣ridet  Necessity scorns the bands of law  "Nihil magis justum est quam quod necessarium est" c c  Nothing is more  JUST  than that which is  NECESSARY  c c  But the man who has not sufficient discrimination to assign the due legal limits to these doctrines of  necessity  is certainly unworthy to be trusted either in  law  or  poli∣tics  For the  common law of England  requires the accom∣accomplished  lawyer  or  politician  to be also  a christian  and cannot therefore excuse the too fashionable doc∣trine of the vulgar great that a  state necessity  is not li∣mited by the common rules of  honesty  and  morality  The maxims in question therefore manifestly  relate only to such  laws  as are made to remedy inconve∣niencies  not in themselves evil  mere  mala prohibita  but cannot authorize any thing that is  malum in se  for that would be REBELLION AGAINST GOD which no case can justify  See the protest of a private person against every suspension of law c p to  For of those who say  Let us do evil that good may come  the scripture has ad∣ded  "whose damnation is just"  Rom iii and there∣fore  "melius est omnia mala pati quam malo consentire"  It is better to endure ALL adversities than to assent to ONE evil measure  is an established maxim of  right  Inst insomuch that a king cannot  legally  dispense with  "malum in se"  nor can all the  omnipotence of parliament  establish it by statute because by the renovating principles of the common law any such statute must be deemed  null  and  void in itself  a mere  corruptela  and  no statute  as I have elsewhere amply proved And as  iniquity  or  malnm in se  is never  lawful  neither is it ever NECESSARY but on the contrary  impolitic  and  hurtful  even to a proverb  "He that soweth  iniquity  shall reap  vanity  and the rod of his anger shall fall" Prov xxii  as it commonly  "renders bad worse"  this is the  ordinary  effect of wicked policy so amply demon∣strated in the  experience  of the celebrated author's  poli∣tical friends  so that even the powerful plea of  necessity  cannot justify such  expedients  nor excuse the  dishonesty  and  treacherous conspiracy  of those who practise them because the  immorality  of such evil policy whether at∣tended with success or not is always  certain  and  humi∣liating  for the  worldly  politician who strives to parry off  evil  by  evil  from being perhaps simply  unfortu∣nate  renders himself  base miscreant  and  dishonourable  In a prophetical description of  an abandoned man  see Psalm xxxvi it is declared as a part of such a character that  he hath not abomi∣nated  EVII  What then shall we say of those wretched  timeservers  who not only  vote  for every  evil  measure and oppose every  good  one see  Thoughts on a Parliamentary Reform  but even promote and inculcate  evil  by  precept  and regular  principles  see the detestable false doctrines of  Political Necessity  already cited The  not hating evil  soon draws after it the whole character of  reprobacy  These with due deference to  "the speculative and re∣fined observers"  are the additions or epithets due to  immorality  whenever it is active but this is not all even if the  wicked policy  seems at any time to be suc∣cessful if it ever assists in warding off a  temporary mis∣fortune  yet it only transfers the merited suffering from  this world  to the  next  by rendering the mere  worldly  politician obnoxious to  eternal judgement  which is cer∣tainly due to every one that shews himself more afraid of  man  than of his  Creator  more a passive subject under  "the prince of this world"  which is the  devil  himself the  "mammon of unrighteousness"  than a  free citizen of the kingdom of God  For the indispensable duty of the latter is "  righteousness on all occasions  literally  "in everytime"  or  "at all times"  for there can be  no time  when  righteousness  and  true judgement  are not to be maintained so that there never can be a  necessity  to dispense with them or  suspend  them "  Blessed are the keepers  or maintainers  of judgement  "  i e true  legal  judgement without respect of persons of which the constitutional term in England is  "the due process of the law"  and "  blessed also is he that doth  RIGHTEOUSNESS AT ALL TIMES" Psalm cvi This is an unquestionable AXIOM of the  eternal law  of God and consequently must be received as one of the infallible  maxims  or  foundations  of the  common law of England  " this only is  honourable  this only is  politic  because "  whosoever doth not  RIGHTEOUSNESS  is not of God  " John And the same just principle is equally indispensable in the duty of every  free citizen of the kingdom of England  by all the infallible foundations of our common law to which the propositions of  "the speculative and refined observers"  are utterly repugnant How then shall we reconcile them Must the very  foundations  of our law and national policy be torn up to make room for a tottering fabric of INIQUITY frightfully reared and suspended upon the rotten prop of an imaginary NECESSITY No let us rather examine whether the proposition be true on which this supposed  necessity  is built viz that  go∣vernment  cannot be managed without certain degrees "of violence corruption and imposition  or whether on the contrary this detestable union of three diabolical principles "  violence corruption  and  imposition  " is not itself the most obvious efficient cause of all the  ne∣cessities  and  misfortunes  of every government and which if not speedily reformed in our own must inevitably produce a total subversion of the state and kingdom  Search the histories of all preceding nations that are either entirely lost and overwhelmed with calamity and misery or else still unhappily continue upon earth a contrasted memorial of their once flourishing ancestry in a wretch∣ed existence of  political slavery  subjected to the despotic will caprice and misgovernment of arbitrary tyrants and see if a single instance can be found among them of any nation being thus deplorably reduced till these baneful seeds of destruction  violence corruption  and  imposition  planted and watered by the  refined ob∣servations  of such  "speculative"  writers as the author of  "Thoughts on a Parliamentary Reform"  c had taken deep root had sprouted grown up and flou∣rished under their fostering hands till they were ripe for such a harvest and yet these  refined observers  would have us believe that the Creator hath  constituted a world upon one plan and a religion for it on another  p as if there was no DIVINE PROVIDENCE  in this world  to favour and encourage  just  men and  just  measures or as if  "God's ways were not equal"  which it seems was an erroneous conception also of the back∣sliding people of Israel  Yet saith the house of Israel The way of the Lord is not equal  O HOUSE OF ISRAEL ARE NOT MY WAYS EQUAL  are not your ways un∣equal Therefore will I judge you O house of Israel every one  ACCORDING TO HIS WAYS  saith the Lord God Repent and turn yourselves from all your transgres∣sions  SO INIQUITY SHALL NOT BE YOUR RUIN  c Ezek xviii By the  ruin  here spoken of as occasioned by  iniquity  is to be understood a  temporal  ruin to be brought upon their nation on account of the  vio∣lence corruption  and  imposition  and other  iniquities  with which their political  "government"  was unhappily  "managed"  This sense is rendered obvious by the preceding chapter as well as by several which follow it and particularly in the d chapter these three baneful  iniquities  are plainly pointed out as principally concurring to effect the then approaching destruction of Jerusalem And first with respect to "VIOLENCE"  Behold  said the prophet  the princes of Israel every one were in thee to their power to shed blood  And again    in the midst of thee have they  DEALT BY OPPRESSION  with the stranger in thee have they vexed the fatherless and widow  And with respect to their IMPOSI∣TION and DECEIT  In thee  said the prophet  are men which  CARRY TALES  to shed blood  and with respect to their CORRUPTION and BRIBERY  In thee  said the prophet  have they  TAKEN GIFTS  to shed blood  And these with other crimes are ex∣pressly declared to be the true causes of their political failure and national disgrace  "behold therefore"  said the prophet in the name and power of him who sent him  I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee Can thine heart endure  or  be firm    or can thy hands be strong in the days that I shall deal with thee  I THE LORD JEHO∣VAH  have spoken  it  and will do  it  And then follows the denunciation of vengeance the usual effect of such  "management"  in politics  And I will scatter thee among the heathen  or nations  and disperse thee in the countries and will consume thy filthiness out of thee  Ezek xxii These are clearly  temporal  judge∣ments  the expulsion  of a  whole nation from their native country  and their dispersion as vagabonds amongst their enemies for their  wicked policy  in having  "managed"  their  government  with "  violence imposition  and  corruption  "  In the d chapter also the prophet again repeat∣edly reproves their impious supposition of an  inequality  in the  ways  of the  Creator  which appears to have been essentially the same with the  Deistical  proposition of our  "refined observers"  about  a world upon one plan and a religion for it on another  See verses to  Yet the children of thy people say The way of the Lord is not equal but as for them  said the prophet speaking of the  "speculative refined observers"  of that day  their way is not equal When the  RIGHTEOUS  turneth from his  RIGHTEOUSNESS  and committeth  INIQUITY  whe∣ther in "  violence imposition  or  corruption  " or as a li∣terary advocate for all three  he shall even die thereby But if the wicked turn from his wickedness and do that which  is LAWFUL and RIGHT  he shall  LIVE THERE∣BY  Yet ye say the way of the Lord is not equal O ye house of Israel I will judge you every one after his ways  And a little farther in the same chapter the prophet is charged with a solemn appeal to them concerning the  improbability  of their being permitted to continue in  possession of their country  if they continued their detesta∣ble practices of  violence  c in direct opposition to the  plan religion  and  laws  of the Creator  Wherefore say ye unto them thus saith the  LORD GOD  Ye eat with the blood  a practice expressly forbid under the  patri∣archal  and  Christian  as well as the  Mosaic  dispensations  and lift up your eyes toward your idols  This is a charge of criminality which cannot be evaded by those who pray before  images  on the delusive pretence of assisting their de∣votion for though their prayers may be addressed to the  prototype  yet they are certainly guilty of  lifting up their eyes toward their idols  and shed blood and  SHALL YE POSSESS THE LAND  Ye stand upon your sword  i e they trusted in their  standing ar∣mies  the power of  the beast  and the source of all their criminal VIOLENCE  "ye work abomination"  which in∣cludes every species of CORRUPTION and immorality  and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife  Thus  private  vices also hasten  public  calamities and  national  dis∣inheritance and should therefore be strictly presented and suppressed by censures and amerciaments in the courts of the congregation the only effectual means of restraining  immorality  and "SHALL YE POSSESS THE LAND" and then follows God's vindication of his PROVIDENCE in an awful de∣nunciation of a  sure temporal vengeance  for such enormi∣ties  Say thou thus unto them Thus saith the  LORD GOD  as I live surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the postilence For  I WILL LAY THE LAND MOST DESOLATE  and the pomp of her strength shall cease and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate that none shall pass through Then shall they know that I am the Lord when I have laid the  LAND  most desolate  BECAUSE  of all their abominations which they have committed  It is manifest there∣fore that the Creator hath NOT  constituted a world upon one plan and a religion for it on another  but as  "his ways are equal"  doth indispensably require all men who profess  his religion  as well  rulers  as  subjects  to conduct themselves in all things according to the  plan of that religion  which is  righteousness  For  the Prince of peace  our leader and instructor is also  the King of righteousness  and accordingly the  only plan of government  which christians can hope to maintain  in this world  with prosperity and success must be that of "  righteousness  for "RIGHTEOUSNESS  exalteth a nation  " "  but  SIN  is a reproach to any people  " Prov xiv  The throne  is established by  righteousness  Prov xvi See also the noble maxim of  eternal law  in Psalm xxxvii  which may thus be rendered  preserve  INTEGRITY  and regard  RIGHT  for the aftereffect to a man is peace  This is the uniform doctrine of many other texts which mani∣festly relate to the  management of temporal governments in this world  The advice of the apostle Paul to the Philippians ch i v was manifestly intended to regulate their whole behaviour as a  chris∣tian community  and not merely their duty as  individuals  Only let your  CONVERSATION  be as it becometh the gospel of Christ  The imperative verb  in our letters  politeuesthe  rendered  let your conversation be  included the  political  duty of the Philippians in all their  public  transactions and arrangements for the government of their  community  as well as the duty of  individuals  and the maintain∣ing such  becoming conversation  in all our dealings public or private as may be suitable to our religious profession is not only a rule of  chris∣tianity  but also of the  old law Right  either in the practice of the courts of judgement or in politics was never to be set aside Nay not only  right  but  right right  i e  perfect right  or as it is rendered in our common version "  that which is altogether  JUST  shalt thou follow  " And the  reason  for that excellent  rule  is not less binding upon  English∣men  at this day than it ought to have been upon the Israelites to whom it was originally declared viz  that thou mayest live and inhe∣rit the land  A reason surely which ought to awe all temporal governments into a strict observance of  "right right"  of invariable  righteousness  and  honesty  in all their measures See Deut xvi  That which is altogether just    or RIGHT RIGHT  shalt thou follow that thou mayest live and  INHERIT THE LAND  which the Lord thy God giveth thee  Therefore even in  worldly policy  as well as in  future judgement  the old English proverb is irrefragable  "Honesty is always the best policy"  and therefore  "the world"  or that part of it which is  constituted  upon  a different plan  is NOT  constituted by the Creator  neither can it have any part in him  For  what fellowship is there between RIGHTEOUSNESS  and  ILLEGALITY  and  what communion to  LIGHT  with  DARKNESS  and what concord to Christ with Belial  Cor vi  but belongeth to that being alone which  de∣ceiveth the nations  to their  temporal  as well as their  eternal  destruction  That old serpent called the devil and satan which  DECEIVETH THE WHOLE WORLD  Rev xii i e deceiveth all that numerous and un∣happy part of mankind that do not resist him accord∣ing  to the Creator's plan of religion  but blindly adopt the contrary plan of "  violence corruption  and  imposition  " These are the servants and ministers of Satan and not of God and every  "government" managed  on such principles is manifestly a  branch  of Satan's temporal dominion fitted for destruction a hateful part of  that world  which is opposed to the kingdom of Christ in the several texts that have been so grossly misunderstood by the celebrated writer abovementioned  "Let no man deceive you"  said the beloved apostle of Christ  he that doeth  RIGHTEOUSNESS  is  RIGH∣TEOUS  even as he is  RIGHTEOUS  He that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning  And again  in this  THE CHILDREN OF GOD  are ma∣nifest and  THE CHILDREN OF THE DEVIL  who∣soever  DOETH NOT RIGHTEOUSNESS  is not of  GOD  nei∣ther he that loveth not his brother  John iii and So that even the  omission  of righteousness is also fatal and impolitic though not perhaps in so great a degree as the actual exercise of our celebrated author's three practical principles of  iniquity  In the history of David we find that his  omissions  to execute  justice  and  right  on some occasions were at∣tended by punishments almost as exemplary as those which marked his actual crimes His neglect to pu∣nish his son  Amnon  's detestable violence and persidy to∣wards his sister  Tamer  produced the treacherous mur∣der of  Amnon  by his brother  Absalom  and again his farther neglect to punish  Absalom  for that notorious  mur∣der  for no  human authority  can pardon murder left him a  bloody  enemy to seek his own life and actually to de∣throne him for a time  The holy scriptures abound with such striking in∣stances of  bad  as well as of  good  actions but  all  of them are to be deemed as  ensamples written for our ad∣monition  Cor x and therefore we must not presume to say with the celebrated author that some of the occurrences related in scripture are  of no im∣portance at all  p and the more especially because even the  occurrences  which he himself has picked out  "I have no doubt" says our celebrated author  but that St Paul was shipwrecked and that he left his cloak and his parch∣ments at Troas but the belief of these facts makes no part of christianity nor is the truth of them any proof of its authority It proves only that this apostle could not in common life be under the perpetual influence of infallible inspiration for had he been so he would not have put to sea before a storm nor have forgot his cloak  and cited as samples of this unwarrantable doc∣trine and doubtless a gentleman so celebrated in the polite world for wit and genius must be supposed to have chosen the most  obvious samples  that could be found if there were any are so far from being of  no im∣portance at all  that they are on the contrary  high∣ly important  and truly  profitable for doctrine for re∣proof for correction  c as indeed every other oc∣currence related in scripture most certainly is both  important  and  necessary  in some respect or other whe∣ther we have sagacity to discover it or not because the same authority assures us that  ALL SCRIPTURE is given by  inspiration of God and  IS PROFITABLE  for  DOCTRINE  for  REPROOF  for  CORRECTION  for  INSTRUCTION  in righteousness  c Tim iii  Happily the celebrated writer it seems has  "no doubt"  of  "these facts"  for otherwise  "the belief"  of them he must allow  "is necessary"  if it is but for  one plain reason  viz that they  are related in the holy scrip∣tures  but whenever the occurrences mentioned in scrip∣ture  are related in any other way  in any way I mean that is  contrary to  or  unsupported  by the scriptureaccount of them like the celebrated author's  own way of rela∣ting  the occurrences in question then indeed as he says  "the belief of these facts"  when SO RELATED  "makes no part of christianity"  When this gentleman for instance remarks concerning  "the truth of them"  that  it proves only that this apostle could not in com∣mon life be under the perpetual influence of infallible in∣spiration  a point which requires no proof or dis∣pute at all he immediately subjoins by way of illus∣tration a state of circumstances which is utterly discor∣dant with the scriptureaccount of  "these facts"  say∣ing  "for had he been so"  i e under the influence of inspiration  he would not have put to sea before a storm nor forgot his cloak  But the celebrated author him∣self had  "forgot"  it seems that the apostle  was a prisoner  at that time and could not avoid being  "put to sea"  so that this circumstance  proves  nothing at all to the purpose of his argument and he has  for∣got  likewise another circumstance which is still more unlucky for his assertion viz that the holy scripture has expressly informed us that the apostle  actually foretold the danger of the voyage  and has thereby given us ample proof of his being under  the influence of infallible inspiration  at the very time and in the very fact which the celebrated writer has ingeniously cited as a proof to the contrary See Acts xxvii The occurrence is therefore so far from being of  "no importance at all"  that it is perhaps the  most important  of any in the whole history of that apostle if we except his conversion because the actual attention of  divine providence  towards just and righteous men is exemplified for the comfort of all persons that are truly religious in this eminent instance of God's regard to the person of Paul in giving him such  foreknowledge for his preservation  And the other circumstances of the shipwreck are also  highly important  in many other respects for though the ship was really lost  agreeable to the apos∣tle's prediction  yet God afterwards  gave to Paul the lives of all that failed with him  whereby he was authorized to assure them of safety even when they were at the ut∣most extremity of danger saying  there shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you  though there were souls onboard so that the celebrated writer has indeed picked out a  most important occurrence  to serve him as a sample of those which he supposes  "of no im∣portance at all"  and as to the other  supposed  occurrence viz that the apostle had  "forgot his cloak"  it has not the least foundation in holy scripture or elsewhere that I know of except in the lively imagination of this agreeable  writer  in order to give a quaint and facetious turn to the end of one of his sentences which is an ob∣ject of more importance it seems with some fashionable authors than  truth  itself That the apostle LEFT  his cloak in Troas      which "I  LEFT" says he  "in Troas with Karpus"  Tim iv and probably  his books  also is not to be dis∣puted but we have no warrant to suppose that he  FOR∣GOT  either cloak or books unless we may be allowed to confound all due discrimination of words and their separate senses for the sake of a  bonmot  And even this circumstance of the apostle's having  "left his cloak and his parchments at Troas"  im∣material as it may seem at first sight is not to be esteemed  "of no importance at all"  for this teaches us that the apostle  though under a  WATCHFUL PROVIDENCE  found it necessary to provide against such natural insirmities as it is committed to the guardianship of human care to fence against and though he was in∣structed with an abundance of revelations  yet  that did not supersede the necessity and use of books for such improvement in knowledge as was within the power of human industry  See Mr Ridley's Sermon preached before the hon Trustees for establishing the Colony of Georgia and the Associates of Dr Bray in p These  occurrences  therefore I hope will at length prove both  "important"  and  "profitable"  even to the celebrated writer himself because a careful review of them as  related in scripture  must convince him that he has been too hasty and superficial in his citations where∣by he himself stands as much in need of  "reproof"  as his celebrated writings do of  "correction"  so that his good sense I hope will incline him to  profit  by the  "instruction"  which necessarily arises from these two  humiliating  circumstances and if ever he should con∣ceive that I may be able to assist his farther  improve∣ment  by the removal of any apprehended disticulties he may assuredly command my best endeavours  found∣ed  not only on the like false idea of the universal and irremediable existence and  prevalence of  wrong  in this world but also which is still worse on the same  imaginary NECESSITY  of yielding to that wrong  for the maintainance of govern∣ment  i e the delusive and baneful doc∣trine of a NECESSITY  to  do evil  that good may come  the common re∣ceived notion of  Deistical  timeservers  who will not admit the true comfortable doctrine of God's immediate direction and  providence over all his works and conse∣quently cannot form any idea of the NE∣CESSITY  of doing right  and of being strictly  just  on all occasions exceeds every  other  necessity  and removes all difficulty from the soundest and best  policy  in the  government of states and kingdoms  "fiat justitia ruat coelum"  This gen∣tleman's  abilities as a writer his ready wit and smooth agreeable stile insure a  ready reception of his sarcasms even against the most interesting and serious  truths  I mean with careless superficial readers who delight more in wit or  in elegant expression than in real infor∣mation But with men of common  sense  and common  honesty  it may be deemed a sufficient answer to this gentleman's  sophistry to remark that in  proving too much  he has far overshot his mark  and  consequently proves nothing  that he has aimed at because his  ingenious  arguments  against all honest endeavours to reform national abuses and against every plan  that has yet been proposed for lessening the corruptions of  parliament  hold e∣qually  good against  having any parliament at all  and when we find that this appa∣rent  tendency of his arguments is not only a necessary conclusion to be drawn  from thence exactly what an opponent would wish to fix upon him but also that it is a conclusion expressly acknow∣ledged even in his own words see p that  those who cannot make shift with such a parliament must have none  c we may fairly suppose that he is not more serious in this than in most of his other positions and of course that  the schemes presented to the public by real and pretended patriots that is  as he says  by those who have more honesty than sense and those who have more  sense than honesty  are not the only ob∣jects of this subtle writer's irony but that he meant equally to ridicule the whole pack of their yelping  opponents  even his staunch old friends the pen∣sioned advocates for  corruption  and  good government  as they are pleased to call it by setting them full cry upon false scents of untenable arguments  But if I am deceived in attributing to him a deeper  "sense"  and more  "honesty"  at bottom than perhaps he is willing to acknowledge yet I should be sorry to fall into the contrary extreme of imputing to him any degree of that unhappy dispro∣portion between  "sense"  and  "honesty"  which he himself without the least scru∣ple so quaintly and facetiously imputes to every other person that has written upon the subject Common charity therefore obliges me to give him credit at least for the  honesty  of meaning well howso∣ever  wide his arguments may be from truth and loyalty and as to his  sense  I have never presumed to question it but only the  use  or rather the  abuse  he has made of it for after all my hopes of being pardoned for the freedom of these remarks must rely on his  good sense  and I sincerely desire to experience so notable an instance of it though I am far from expecting the farther satisfaction of  re∣ceiving his thanks  for my labour and pains in searching and proposing an  effectual re∣medy  to the  "one capital defect"  of his most eligible plan of reformation because a removal of this  defect  in his opinion it seems would deprive the  favoured  plan of  "its chief excellence"  viz its sup∣posed  impracticability  an  excellence  how∣ever to be relished only by professed  enemies to reformation and order  To be convinced of the  IMPRACTICABILITY  of this scheme  says he in p  let  us but figure to ourselves  multitudes  of all descriptions and denominations called out to exercise their right of voting in∣flamed by contest and intoxicated by li∣quor  c  But it is more reasonable in the first place to consider the actual state of things  "let us"  therefore rather  fi∣gure to ourselves  what is really the case at present  multitudes of all descrip∣tions and denominations  actually  call∣ed out  not indeed  to exercise their  RIGHT  of voting  but what is far more dangerous to the community  to exercise  the WRONG  of preventing others from voting  by tumultuously ob∣structing every avenue to the pollbooks and raving with all the horrible malice that the devil and drunkenness can inspire that they may intimidate and hinder quiet electors that really  have the right of voting  from  "exercising their right"  so that  elections  can be no longer  free  whilst such notorious  menacing  and open violence is so generally tolerated  Let us  also  "figure to ourselves"  for the horrible scenes have been too recently im∣printed on our memories to be easily ef∣faced these suborned  multitudes of all descriptions  and beyond all description or of no description at all as much  in∣flamed by contest and intoxicated by li∣quor  as they possibly could be even if admitted to a  "right of voting"  weavers from their looms and miners from tinneries and coalpits sailors from their ships and soldiers from their quarters to whom we must add  as the celebrated author has done  thou∣sands of thieves smugglers rogues va∣gabonds and vagrants  and  we must add  also select troops of Irish chairmen from the environs of the polite gaminghouses and whole bands of jour∣neymen  butchers the very scum and offal of all the shambles brandishing their formidable cleavers  I say let us figure to ourselves all these respectable  hinder∣ers and obstructors of  free  election  let loose  not only for  "one day"  but for many days together  throughout every part of the kingdom and such a scene of confusion of drunkenness and riot of rapine  and even of  "murder"  c  "will present itself"  by due recollection of very recent facts more strongly than by mere  imagination    "as must shock us"  indeed  "with horror"  and ought there∣fore to convince us that we already ex∣perience the most consummate mischiefs and inconveniencies that can possibly arise either from the  multitude  or the  mean∣ness  of the persons that usually attend elections What then must we think of the  morality  and  patriotism  of those persons who regularly oppose every attempt to  reform these intolerable grievances and corruptions  With respect to the  danger  which the celebrated author apprehends from all the rabble being  let loose in one day throughout every part of the kingdom  it is a mere bugbear are they not at present frequently  let loose in one day throughout every part of the kingdom  even  "one day"  in every week Nay are they not at liberty  any day  or  every day  to be as  "loose"  if they please as those haughty persons who falsely esteem themselves so much their betters and yet perhaps they are  not more licencious  though certainly  much less guilty  than their unprincipled CORRUPTORS a great ma∣jority of  "the honourable gentlemen"  as they call themselves who solicit their favour at elections to whom  all the mobs  and  all the mischiefs  on those occasions are chiefly to be attributed for those  men who bribe treat lead and excite these disorderly  multitudes  cannot surely be exempted by their rank titles or fortunes from being deemed a  part of the mob  when they are notoriously the most  guilty and vicious part  of it by being principals and movers of the rabble  And such men should remember that the vile practice of  opening houses for elec∣tion purposes  is a species of  bribery  not only the most  pernicious  to the people and kingdom but also the most effectually  degrading  to themselves because they are thereby absolutely  incapacitated in law  to take their seats see note in p and therefore all those persons that may fairly be convicted of this most  pernicious  and  degrading  misdemeanour ought most certainly for the honour of the house to be ejected  Let us also figure to ourselves  the present inconvenient and hopeless method of  determining dis∣puted  and undue elections  and also the  lamentable number of them  by which the precious time and attention of the great  national council  must be principally en∣grossed to the manifest hindrance of na∣tional business whereas in ancient times when  general elections  throughout the kingdom were  every year once and more often if need be  viz previous to  every session  of parliament though the  sessions  were held not only  annually  but often twice and sometimes three and four times in a year yet  there were not above two or three cases of elections questioned or complained of for above    years  see "the Legal Means of Political Reformation p and so that a restoration of our ancient parlia∣mentary rights and a due reformation of modern abuses and  innovations  are unquestionably necessary to be demanded now that the exercise of our inestimable franchises are sunk down through the  enormous disproportion  of popular Repre∣sentation to the  very lowest degree  of pos∣sible existence and that all our public circumstances are really tainted with the most  noxious corruption  imaginable ex∣ceeding any  superlative of it  that can ei∣ther be expressed or even conceived In short there is but  one degree lower in humiliation and baseness  to which the na∣tion can possibly descend and that would be to adopt the wicked and  disloyal  posi∣tion of this celebrated writer viz that  those who cannot make shift with such a parliament must have none  For to be contented like him  to make shift with such a parliament  would certainly be the  lowest degree  of  parliamentary corrup∣tion  for it cannot descend any lower as I have already remarked without ac∣tually losing its existence and therefore  the one degree lower  would be to admit this gentleman's baneful alternative the  having no parliament  at all which is cer∣tainly  the lowest degree of  POLITICAL SLA∣VERY  The  necessity  therefore of  a parlia∣mentary reform  is UNQUESTIONABLE notwithstanding this celebrated writer's  "Thoughts"  to the contrary and the  prac∣ticability  of it will be equally certain if the  constitutional remedy  to the present national  immorality  and  corruption  is but previously applied viz a due  reestablishment of the ancient  VIEW  of  FRANKPLEDGE with all its  just  and  legal  usages and appen∣dages for this is the true  stateantiseptic  which will sicken the  worms of undue in∣fluence  and put an effectual stop to their baneful progress on the vitals of the Eng∣lish constitution especially if some far∣ther reasonable and very necessary heads of  enquiry  be added to the  articles of an∣nual inquest  which I have already stated in pages to and ought to be in∣serted  after the d article  Of all man∣ner of conspirators  leaving the arti∣cle there distinguished by the number for the conclusion of the whole  Item Whether the  Elections of members to parliament have been free∣ly and indifferently made without charge or expence  as required by the laws of this kingdom See and W III civ AD and Geo II c A D What person or persons have re∣ceived  bribes  of any kind or have  eaten or drunk  the most pernicious participation of  bribery  at the expence of others du∣ring the time of an  election  The penalty of receiving any  "reward whatsoever"  on such occasions is l besides an  incapa∣city  from ever voting again see stat Geo II c And  meat and drink entertain∣ment or provision  are expressly deemed articles of  reward  in the previous statute of king William See note in p  What attornies or other persons have been agents in distributing money or other reward of any kind or in pro∣mising reward or emolument during the time of an election  What public houses have been  opened  a term sufficiently understood by the notorious practice of it for the pur∣pose of influencing any election after the teste of the writ or after the place be∣came vacant and who hath paid or hath undertaken to pay and is directly or in∣directly responsible for the expences incurred by such public and unlawful en∣tertainment If the proofs on this head can be fairly traced so as to criminate the  persons elected  they are thereby effectual∣ly incapacitated from holding their un∣justlyacquired seats in parliament and by virtue of the abovementioned statute of and William III are  to be deemed and taken  no  members in parliament  and shall not act sit or have any vote or place  c  as if they had never been returned or elected members for the par∣liament  and the act does not limit the conviction to any fixed period of time after the offence so that there is ample leisure and opportunity for researches on that head which all true friends to the  honour and dignity of parliament  ought to promote  What publican or victualler hath supplied  meat drink  entertainment  or  provision  during the time of an elec∣tion to any person or persons whom they might justly have suspected of not intend∣ing to pay for the same at their own cost and charge For in this case the publican is as much a criminal agent in  bribery  as the pettyfogging attorney who  bribes  with cash notes or promises and is equally liable to all the penalties of  bribery  And what person hath made any disbursements or expenditure whatsoever either in his own behalf or in trust for others or even promise of expenditure or repayment directly or indirectly to promote such dishonest and baneful prac∣tices against the peace and welfare of the community  There is no doubt but that regular  an∣nual  enquiries upon oath in all parts of the kingdom on these points would put an effectual stop to the  expences  and  cor∣ruption  of elections and consequently to the  tumults  and other immoralities of them whereby the trite argument against the  constitutional frequency of elections  would of course be superseded so that the ancient right of newly electing our representatives for  every session of parlia∣ment  might again be happily restored without either  inconvenience  to the elec∣tors or  expence  to the candidates  And lastly as the original intention of these legal divisions of the people into  tithings  and  hundreds  was obviously for  military  as well as  civil  purposes some other additional articles of enquiry will also be necessary to reestablish and main∣tain the ancient  legal military duties  of the people in a regular WATCH and WARD throughout the kingdom in order to prevent every species of  robbery riot  or other  violence  whatsoever by in∣ternal enemies as well as to be thorough∣ly prepared without the enormous and ruinous expence which at present is thought necessary against the apprehen∣sion of invasions by foreign enemies  That this was an ancient object of en∣quiry at  views of Frankpledge  is manifest by the article which I cited from  Fleta  in p n viz  Item de vigiliis non obser∣vatis  Also concerning watches not duly observed  That the ancient and true constitution of the English state absolutely requires every man the clergy and judges except∣ed to have  arms  and to be duly  trained  and  exercised  in the use of them I have amply proved in my  Tracts on the Means of National Defence  so that from thence it will be very easy to form such  additional articles of enquiry  as may be ne∣cessary to restore and preserve these two great national objects the  general arming  and  training  of the people to military ser∣vices in WATCH and WARD whereby the imaginary necessity of maintaining  a numerous standing army in constant pay  the most dangerous and unconstitutional of all our modern  innovations  will be effectually superseded and of course a probable means and opportunity would thereby be laid open to a  virtuous  admi∣nistration of government a title that will most certainly be due to any administra∣tion that shall adopt and restore the  just  and  free  constitution of  tithings  and  hun∣dreds  in their ancient  legal  purity of crowning their success in reformation with an effectual reduction of the  national debt  and  taxes  by means of the great annual savings that would arise from a proper  gradual decrease  I say a  gradual decrease  because I wish the reduc∣tion of our armies to be made without injury or any material inconvenience to the brave officers and men that have faithfully served therein to whom are certain∣ly due all the kindness and reasonable liberality that the nation can afford to shew them and though I am a  professed  enemy to STANDING ARMIES in general yet at the same time I  profess  and really entertain a very cordial regard and benevolence to the deserving  indivi∣duals  of which they are composed The kind of re∣duction therefore which I wish to see is such as they themselves I believe would not think either  unjust  or  hard  upon them and yet I trust that  the savings  arising from it would be as  effectual  and  speedy  as those of any other plan that the nation can with consistent honour and due liberality to the parties adopt Let us therefore suppose a reduction to be made  by time  rather than by the  involuntary discharge  of any one and by putting an  entire step to recruiting and to the granting of any new commissions  rather than by the  stoppage  of pay Let  discharges  however be  freely granted  to all that  request  them and let  liberal bounties  in proportion to rank and pay be given to incite  such requests  that industrious subaltern officers and men may be encoura∣ged and enabled to engage themselves in  civil  occupa∣tions A preference should also be given in the dis∣posal of lucrative  civil  employments under the crown in such employments I mean as are necessary to be continued to deserving officers that are properly quali∣fied for them provided they give up their  military  com∣missions and profession which would much hasten the reduction of the army and  its expences  The corps of  Engineers  and the regiment of  Artillery  however are branches of the military establishment which cannot so safely be reduced or at least not in so great a degree as the other military corps because they cannot so easily as other regiments be raised again in case of any sudden want of them a regular education being necessary for  engineers  and  artillery  officers in the study of mathematics projectiles mechanics military architecture surveying drawing c But a proper establishment in these two branches duly maintained in study and practice would in case of any sudden emergency enable the  present national militia  and the  trained hundreds  and  thousands  or HOSTS of the people in their  rotations  of service to oppose with sufficient ef∣fect any power humanly speaking that could possibly be brought against them I have here supposed the  na∣tional militia  to remain on its present establishment for though I contend that the  hundreds  and  tithings  when duly  trained  form the true  constitutional militia  of this kingdom yet until that happy legal constitution can be so effectually reestablished as to be deemed of itself suf∣ficient for the national defence I should be very un∣willing to propose any alteration in the present establish∣ment of militia for the counties except indeed some such obvious amendments as may render it less burden∣some and ruinous to poor labourers by throwing a more adequate proportion of the expence upon those that can better afford it and also to prevent any man from being detained from home after he is duly disciplined longer than  a month  or six weeks at most at any one time in actual service lest he should thereby lose his  civil  occu∣pation and become a  mere  soldier See  Tracts on the Means of National Defence by a free Militia  p  of the duties of our  present military establishments  The duties of  watch  and  ward  or  guard  were rendered light and easy by  an  equal service  of the whole body of the people  "in rotation"  for which the modern term is  "a roster of service"  See "Leges Gulielmi Regis" as published in Lambard's Archionomia st edit to fol Statuimus c  We or∣dain that all the Cities and Boroughs and Castles and Hundreds and Wapen∣takes of our whole kingdom aforesaid shall every night be watched and guarded  IN GYRUM  i e into a circle or  rather by "a ROTATION" viz a ros∣ter of service  against crimes and enemies according as the sherifes and aldermen and magistrates and our ministers shall best provide by common council for the welfare of the kingdom  And a little farther he adds  statuimus et firmiter praecipimus  c  We ordain and strictly command that all earls barons knights ministers  servientes or ser∣jeants  and  ALL THE FREEMEN  of our whole kingdom aforesaid  universi liberi homines totius regni nostri praedicti  shall have and hold themselves always well  IN ARMS  and horses as it is fit and right and that they may be always ready and prepared to fulfil their  ENTIRE SERVICE TO US  and effectually to act whenever there shall be occasion accord∣ing to the duly which they ought to do of right  de jure  to us for their lands and tenements and according as we  command them by the  COMMON COUN∣CIL  i e by the parliament  of the whole kingdom aforesaid  And this ENTIRE SERVICE TO THE KING thus duly limited by the national COMMON COUNCIL of the WHOLE KINGDOM was rendered still more suitable to the dignity of a  free people  by the ENTIRE ELECTION also among themselves of all their of∣ficers not only of the  tithingmen  who had the  civil  power of  constables  and the  military  authority of  serjeants  and of the  hundreders  who had the  civil  authority of  highconstables  and  justiciaries  and the  military  rank of  captains  but also of the  viscounts  or  sherifs  and of the  heretochii  the commanders or leaders of the army "DUCTORES EXERCITUS"  The same  says the learned judge Atkins  See judge Atkins's "parliamentary and political tracts" p "Sir Edw Coke in his d Inst" says judge Atkins  in his exposition of the statute of Westminster cap concerning the election of the coroners by the freeholders which ever was so and so still continues says there is the same reason for election of sheriffs and so says he it anciently was by writ directed to the coroners In like manner  con∣tinues judge Atkins  were the conservators of the peace chosen in whose place the justices of the peace now succeed and so the verdurers of the forest are to this day These were great and high liberties and did belong to the  freeholders  by which he must mean the  liberi tenentes  the free  holders  in  burgage  tenure viz the  householders  or  Deceners  as well as others  from all antiquity and are strong arguments to confirm those late authors that will by no means allow of a limited government but leave us under an arbitrary power and who call our laws and liberties but the concessions and condescensions from the regal and absolute power    as in the dialect of this present age may be called the lordlieutenants or deputylieutenants  For this the learned judge refers us to the law of K Edward above cited  "Isti vero viri"  speaking of the HERETOCHII  eligebantur per commune concilium pro communi utilitate regni per provincias et patrias universas et per singulos comitatus in  PLENO FOLKMOTE  This  full folkmote  for the election of  heretoches  or  lordlieutenants  and of the  sheriffs  was ordered to be held every year in the beginning of October by the same law  Item aliud  folkmote  esse debet in quo∣libet comitatu per provincias et patrias totius regni praedicti universas scilicet in capite kl Octob ad providendum ibi quis erit vicecomes et qui erunt eorum  beretochii  et ad audiendum ibi justa eorum precepta concilio et assensu procerum et judicio folksmote  c    sicut et  VICE∣COMITES  provinciarum et comitatuum  ELIGI DE∣BENT  "This law" says the learned judge At∣kins "mentions this election as an use and custom"  I must however remark that this quotation is ta∣ken from that part of K Edward's laws which is printed in  italics  in Mr Lambard's edition and which Mr Prynne calls a  "spurious addition"  and he cites a much higher authority that of the learned Abp Usher for the same opinion Mr Lambard himself however informs us that there were two different exemplars the one  per antiquum  "very ancient" and "the other" says he  is not indeed so ancient which however con∣tains more    alterum non ita sanè vetus quod tamen plura complectatur  And he informs us that he himself  after making a diligent comparison of them had joined both together in such a manner however  says he  that the whole of the old exemplar is expressed in the  LARGER  letters  i e the Roman  but whatever is expressed in the  LESSER  characters  the Italics  is to be attributed says he to  the  LATER  copy    quae minoribus vero describuntur caracteribus ea recen∣tiori sunt tribuenda  But he does not express the least suspicion that the latter is  spurious  and he was surely a very competent judge of that matter as being one of the most eminent antiquarians of his time And the rev Dr David Wilkins who printed an edition of the AngloSaxon Laws in has set forth the laws of K Ed∣ward without distinguishing▪ by Roman and Italic let∣ters the various readings of the two eminent exemplars before mentioned as Lambard and Whelock had done before him so that he manifestly thought it right to adopt the additions in  italics  as properly belonging to the text though rejected by Mr Prynne or he would not thus have omitted the distinctions between the two exemplars  Whatever objections Abp Usher might have had to some of the historical circumstances related in this ex∣emplar of K Edward's laws as for instance the cor∣respondence between pope  Elutherius  and the British king  Lucius  the extensive conquests of king  Arthur  c yet as these circumstances were generally received for histo∣rical  facts  long before the fourth year of K William I when these  Laws of Edward  were newly collected  These laws were newly collected in the th year of K William I by a parliament  elected  and called together expressly for that purpose and the manner of the representation was remarkable Twelve re∣presentatives were elected for each county of the whole kingdom and were sworn before the king after the manner of a  jury  that they would to the best of their power without departing either to the right or the left from the path of truth declare their  laws  and  cus∣toms  nothing omitting nothing adding nothing changing by pre∣varication c  Post acquisitionem Angliae  praesatus  Rex  Angliae  Guli  lmu  quarto

facts  and might therefore with great probability be supposed to have inserted them  And as to Mr Prynne's exception in his brief animad∣versions c on the fourth part of the Institutes c compiled by Sir Edw Coke p it is manifestly founded on a mere  literal  error of the transcriber of the M S which by no means injures the general credit of the copy and its other contents Mr Prynne says  I cannot but take notice of one grosse mistake in the  spurious addition  to the laws of K Edward the con∣fessor in Mr Lambert cited in the d Inst p concerning the antiquity of the  folkmote  or  court leet  and administering the oath of allegiance in it to the people  ad defendendum regnum  c  Hanc legem inve∣nit  ARTHURUS  qui quondam fuit inclytissimus rex  BRI∣TONUM  et ita consolidavit et confoederavit regnum  BRI∣TANNIAE  universum semper in unum Hujus legis  AU∣THORITATE  meaning the authority or happy ef∣fect of free  folkmotes  or  courtleets  i e the incompara∣ble constitution of  Frankpledge  which I now wish to recommend for the same purpose viz to  unite  the whole nation in one  confederated  body by a universal establish∣ment of  the law which Arthur found  with all its just and legal usages  expulit  ARTHURUS  praedictus  SARA∣CENOS  et inimicos a regno  When as it is most clear  says Mr Prynne  by Galfridus Monmuthensis Mat Westminster Radulfus Cestrensis Ponticus Verum∣nius c An Dom to and other our an∣cient and modern historians who write of king  Arthur  record that he  only  fought his several battles with the  Saxons  Scots Picts whom he expelled out of the realm but not with the SARACENS who never infested nor entered our  Island  nor mention any such oath law court prescribed or held by him  Now that K ARTHUR  fought  with the  Saxons Scots Picts  c must be readily allowed and also that he  fought not  with the SARACENS but if we consider the men∣tion of "SARACENOS" as a mere literary mistake of an ignorant transcriber for SCANIOS or SCANDIOS an an∣cient name much less known to the vulgar at the time when this copy was wrote than that of the SARACENS there will be no cause for farther cavil against the authen∣ticity of the copy because such a mistake in a copy ought not to injure the credit of the original compiler of the work And that the word SCANIOS or SCANDIOS was really intended is manifest from the context two pages farther wherein express mention is made of K  Arthur  's conquest of  Scantia  and  Gutland  the countries from whence proceeded the most of Arthur's enemies even the  Saxons  themselves originally see Sheringham de Anglorum Gentis Origine if not the  Picts  also the very nations mentioned by Mr Prynne himself and also by all the authors to whom he has appealed  There is just such another  mere literal  mistake a few pages farther which without proper warning might still farther induce a superficial reader to suspect the au∣thenticity of the exemplar I mean the passage where mention is made of the election of king Ina viz  qui electus suit in regem per  ANGELUM  who was elected king through  or by means of "AN ANGEL a very improbable circumstance instead of the obvious meaning of the original writer i e "  per  ANGLIAM" "  throughout  ENGLAND" For this latter sense is clear∣ly supported by the context immediately following which relates that  Ina first obtained the monarchy of this  WHOLE KINGDOM  c  et qui  PRIMO  obtinuit monarchiam  TOTIUS REGNI HUJUS  post adventum  AN∣GLORUM  in Brytanniam  PRIMUS  enim fuit rex co∣ronatus  ANGLORUM ET BRYTONUM SIMUL MANEN∣TIUM IN BRITANNIA  post adventum Saxonum  c And a little farther the text relates that he obtained  Wales  and  Cornwall  by his second wife as also the con∣secrated British crown which belonged to the last Bri∣tish king Cadwallader so that the circumstance mani∣festly intended to be expressed was the  general acknow∣ledgement of  INA  as king over both the  ENGLISH and the BRITONS that is  "per Angliam"  throughout all Eng∣land  and not  "per Angelum"  Nevertheless these two palpable errors of transcribers have been copied in all the subsequent editions of K Edward's laws with∣out the least animadversion of the publishers to clear the original compilers and their work from the discredit of such improbable circumstances  With respect to Mr Prynne's objection to the antiqui∣ty of the  hundred  courts as declared in this addition to K Edward's laws viz that  "Arthur found this law" "Hanc legem invenit Arthurus" c  "and so" by means thereof  united and confederated the whole king∣dom of Britain into one  et ita consolidavit et confoe∣deravit regnum Britanniae universum semper in unum and that  by virtue of  THIS LAW  the said Arthur drove the  SCANTIANS or Scandinavinians  and enemies out of the kingdom  c I must observe that Mr Prynne has assigned nothing but  negative evidence  against the fact which is by no means sufficient to disprove it On the other hand as  Arthur  did really succeed in  uniting  and  strengthening  the kingdom against his  enemies  the other part of the sentence is the more probable that  he found this law  because he certainly could not have pur∣sued a more effectual and speedy means of restoring a divided and weakened kingdom than by reviving and enforcing  "this law"  which he is said to have  found  and had he been as careful  after his success to maintain "this law"  and to establish it in the countries which he conquered with  free  and  equal  liberty to all the inhabitants the happy effects of his success would not have had so short a duration  For though the Britons certainly  had "this law"  both before and after the time of  Arthur  yet they generally  had  it rather in  name  than in  use  or else they would certainly have been  less dissolute  in their morals and more  united  and powerful against their enemies They  had "this law"  I may say much in the same manner as we  have  it at this day it was really the  law of the kingdom  but not duly maintained the  nominal divisions  remained as at present but these divisions became  local  instead of  popular  the mere  divisions of space  instead of exact numerical  divisions of the people  which  "this law"  requires to be effective A sufficient answer to Mr Prynne's objection against the antiquity of  "this law"  may be gathered from a former part of this tract p where I have referred to ample evidence that the  divisions of hundreds and tithings  CENTURIAE  CENTURIATA COMITIA Those  Comitia  or assemblies of the people of  Rome  by  Centuries  where every one gave his vote in his  century  These sorts of assemblies were first instituted by  Ser∣vius Tullius  who divided as is above said the people into six  classes  and each  classis  into CENTURIES These assemblies had a great share in ordering of all state affairs for they were summoned toge∣ther to make great officers to approve any new law to proclaim war against any people and to implead any citizen of Rome after his death They also chose the consuls praetors censors and sometimes the proconsuls and chief priests  c See Danet's Dict of Greek and Roman antiquities What difficulty then can there be in supposing that  "Arthur found this law"  among the  Britons  who so lately before had been incorporated in the  Roman  colonies of this island  and DECURIAE  Romulus having at first divided the  Roman  people into three tribes he appointed at the head of each tribe a colonel to com∣mand it  i e  the head of a thousand    and afterwards divided each tribe into TEN Curiae or companies and appointed a  centurion  or captain to command an  hundred men  and a  decurion  to command  ten  men  Ibid on the word  Decurio  were in use with the Roman colonies in Britain both in their  civil  and  military  government and that the  Britons  were incorporated in those colonies so that it was very natural for the Britons afterwards to retain something of the same kind though badly obser∣ved in the  civil  constitution of Britain differing for the most part only in names and titles from the future  Saxon  constitution as for instance according to in∣formation  Verum quod modo vocatur  comitatus  olim apud Britones tem∣poribus Romanorum in regno isto Brytanniae vocabatur  consulatus  Et qui modo vocantur  vicecomites  tunc temporis  vice consules  voca∣bantur ille vero dicebatur  viceconsul  qui  consule  absente ipsius vicea supplebat in  jure  et in  foro  Leges Edwardi Regis N  o    from this copy of K Edward's laws  what is now called a  COUNTY  was formerly with the  BRI∣TONS  in the times of the  ROMANS  in this kingdom of  BRITAIN  called  CONSULATUS  And those who are now called  VICECOMITES or sheriffs  were then call∣ed  VICECONSULES  and he that was called  VICECON∣SUL  was the person who in the absence of the consul sup∣plyed his place in the law and in the  COURT  Not only  landowners  but also  householders  and even  all the inhabi∣tants of a county  are to be deemed  suitors to the countycourt  Countie court est le court de viscount  PUR TOUTS LES INHABITANTS  deins le coun∣tie  This is the remark of the learned Mr  H Finch  in his  Nomo∣technia  p on the statute of Merton c which ordains that  every freeman which oweth  SUIT  to the  COUNTY TRYTHING HUN∣DRED  and  WAPENTAKE  or to the court of the lord may freely make his attorney to do those  SUITS  for him  And this must necessarily be understood from the very nature of  Frankpledge  because  every man  according to this  constitutional law  must be incorporated in some  tithing  and  hundred  which are the regular component parts of every  countycourt  and not the mere  landholders  alone as some persons of late have erroneously conceived    And therefore I think we may safely admit the assertion in this copy of K Edward's law that  Arthur found this law  notwithstanding the authority of Mr  Prynne  to the contrary and that the success of the  British  monarch in  uniting  and confederating by it his whole kingdom against foreign and domestic  enemies  is an example per∣fectly suitable to the purpose of my present work  At the time when K Arthur is said to have  "found this law"  it was perhaps no more in general  use  than it is at present for WE even at this day may also be said to  "find this law"  that is we  find it  mentioned in all the lawwriters of the best authority as being the  law and constitution of the kingdom  though the  usage  is certainly lost In a case solemnly argued in the court of common pleas even so late as the th K James the custom of  Frankpledge  was consider∣ed as still  existing in law  though it certainly did not  exist in usage "And it seemed to the court"  says the reporter Sir Edw Coke  that they cannot adjudge him a  CHIEF PLEDGE  upon that verdict  the cir∣cumstances of which are there mentioned  for  LEETS  were divided in  DECURIAS or DECENNAS  unde dicitur  DECENARII  to this day and out of every  TEN and one of them being pledge for the other from whence the court was called CURIA VISUS FRANCIPLEGII  one was called  CAPITALIS PLEGIUS  seu  PRIMARIUS FIDEI JUSSOR and in some places at this day  he is called the  TITHINGMAN  and in Yorkshire  TENMANTALE  And a little farther he adds  and it appeareth by the said act of  Edw II  that it ought to be enquired at the  LEET  if all the  CHIEF PLEDGES  with their  DECENNERS  that is the other  NINE  appears by which it appeareth that the  TENTH  principal man was the  CHIEF PLEDGE  c VI Report  And with respect to the  variations  in these two copies of K Edward's laws collated by Mr Lambard I may now safely remark after having removed some of the prin∣cipal objections that the  variations  which remain are not such as contradict each other in the least and though there is still another copy in  Roger de Hoveden  's annals  See Rerum Anglicarum Scriptores post Bedam Piaecipui c p London  which contains the same laws for the most part but with many  various  readings and without the  histo∣rical additions  yet these several copies contain  no varia∣tions  upon the whole which can justify a rejection of any one of them in favour of another for it is probable that the most learned and loyal people amongst the Eng∣lish in the th year of K William I would be induced at that time particularly to prepare collections of their old laws that they might report and obtain a confir∣mation of them in the parliament that was then called a regular  jury  of  "sapientes et sua lege eruditos" "wise or discrete men and learned in their law"  being required to be  elected  and deputed by each county ex∣pressly for the purpose of  reporting these laws  and that  historical  parts were probably added to some one of the collections even at that time for no subsequent  time  was so likely to give occasion for such an addition by some one or more of these  learned  representatives in order to assert the  antiquity  as well as the  certain efficacy  of the excellent constitution of  Frankpledge  by the emi∣nent examples of the  British  K ARTHUR and of the  Saxon  king EDGAR who both of them  found this law  and experienced the happy effects of  reviving  and  enforcing  it  This law also provides in  terms equally strong for the  general arm∣ing of the people  as the act of K William  does for  "the entire service of the king"  see "cap de Greve"  DEBENT  enim  UNIVERSI LIBERI HOMINES TO∣TIUS REGNI juxta  facultates suas et  possessiones et juxta catalla sua et secun∣dum feodum suum et secundum tenementa  sua  ARMA HABERE  et illa semper prompta conservare ad tuitionem regni  c  That  ALL FREEMEN OF THE WHOLE  kingdom according to their  means c  OUGHT TO HAVE ARMS  and those al∣ways to keep ready for the defence of the kingdom  By the same law they were restrained from  pawning  their arms  Non de∣bent  illa invadiare  i e pignori po∣nere  nex extra regnum vendere sed  hoeredibus suis in extremis legare  c  That  they ought not to pledge them nor  sell them out of the kingdom but bequeath them to their heirs  c  And to secure obedience to this law all men  "universi"  were obliged one certain day every year  to shew their arms throughout the whole kingdom in the cities in the boroughs in the castles in the hundreds and wapentakes of the kingdom which ought to be done  says this law  in the same day through∣out the whole kingdom lest any persons should accommodate their friends and ac∣quaintance  with their arms and they themselves receive them back in return and thereby defraud the justice of the king and injure the king and kingdom  Universi vero praedicti singulis annis in crastino puri∣ficationis beatae Mariae debent omni excusatione remota arma sua per universum regnum ostendere scilicet in civi∣tatibus regni et in Burgis et in Castellis et Hundredis et Wapen achiis Regni secundum eis quod statutum est et adjudicatum et juxta quod debent et idcirco hoc fieri debet uno eodem die per universum regnum ut predictum est ne aliqui possint arma sua familiaribus suis et notis accom∣modare nec ipsi illa mutuo accipere ac justitiam domini regis defraudare et dominum regem et regnum offendere    And the same law also commanded a just and exact observance of the  watch  duty which could be no otherwise in those ancient times than by a regular  rotation  of all the people in  gyrum  as described in king William's law and they were afterwards carefully to provide a∣gainst fires when they returned home to their houses  Et ut  WARDAE i e vigiliae vel custodiae  justè et ritè obser∣ventur et ut cautè deinceps incendiis  sibi illic provideant cum ad propria re∣dibunt  The duty of  watch  and  guard  by the people was deemed so very important in ancient times and surely ought still so to be especially in towns and places of more than ordinary resort that the law prohibited the holding of  markets  and  fairs  in all places except those that were duly  enclosed  and  fortified  and in which of course the inhabitants ought accord∣ing to the common law to perform the duties of  watch and guard  and be always  prepared and trained in arms  as above described for  the entire service of the king  in the true legal sense of service i e for the preservation of the  king's peace  in the effectual prevention of all  tumults  and  riots  for aiding and assisting the king's courts and their  legal  officers in  the due process of the law  and for the effec∣tual security of all peaceable traders and  their property See Leges Gulielmi Regis  Item nullum mercatum vel forum sit nec fieri permittatur nisi in  CIVITATIBUS  regni nostri et in  BURGIS CLAUSIS  et  MURO VALLATIS  et  CASTELLIS  et  LOCIS TUTISSIMIS  ubi consuetudines regni nostri et jus nostrum commune et dignitates coronae nostroe quoe constitutoe sunt a bonis praedecessoribus nostris depe∣rire non possunt nec violari sed omnia ritè et per  JUDICIUM  et  JUSTITIAM  fieri debent Et ideo  CASTELLA  not private  castles  but such only as had a re∣gular establishment of  civil  magistrates  et burgi et civitates sunt et fundatoe et oedificatoe scilicet ad tuitionem gentium et populorum regni et ad defensionem regni et idcirco observari debent cum omni libertate et integritate et ratione  Also no  MARKET  or  FAIR  may be nor may be permitted to be except in the ci∣ties of our kingdom and in enclosed bo∣roughs  fenced with a wall and in castles and most secure places where the usages of our kingdom  so that  private castles  cannot here be meant but such  castles  only as were governed by regular magistrates according to the common law as  New∣castle Chester Rochester Colchester Ci∣rencester Bicester  c  and our com∣mon law and the dignities of our crown c may not be lost nor defrauded nor violated but all things ought to be done in due form and by  JUDGEMENT  and  JUSTICE  And for this cause castles  hereby manifestly intending such  castles  only as I have described  and boroughs and cities are established and built viz for the security of nations and people and for the defence of a kingdom and there∣fore they ought to be maintained with all liberty integrity and reason  Thus every city town and borough was sup∣posed to contain within itself a com∣plete  establishment for maintaining the  common law  and the  dignities of the crown  and for doing all things  in due form  and  by  JUDGEMENT  and  JUSTICE which certainly could not in any other way be effected than by these  numerical divisions of the people  in which the magistracy was always duly proportioned to the  number of inhabitants  so that whether they were  many  or  few  they were all  equally  ma∣nageable And the  rotation  of duty by being regularly  circulated  amongst  all  men was reduced and rendered easy to  all  The cities of the Israelites under the theocracy had the same proportion of magistrates exactly which our common law requires and also regular  rotations  of public ser∣vice but it does not appear that they had our happy constitution of  juries  where∣by unexceptionable and impartial persons  from among the people  that are neighbours to the parties and the facts in every cause  are appointed the LEGAL JUDGES of it Had this indispensable constitution been a part of  their  law as it is of  ours  it is probable they would not so soon have fallen away from  justice  and  judgement  for they had no sufficient guard against  partiality  If a man was accused he had no right to reject the magistrate from being  his judge  even though he knew him to be  his enemy  or the friend and favourer of his accuser whereas in Eng∣land a man may challenge and reject jurymen if he thinks fit p  evious to the trial of a charge of  treason  and jurymen previous to trials for any other  felonies  without assigning any reason against them which is called  peremptory challenge  and he may  challenge  as many more as he can produce  just  and  legal  exceptions against which is called  "challenge with cause"  The total want of this just regulation laid the  magistrates  of the  Israelitish cities  more  open to the temptation of  bribery  than they would otherwise have been and after∣wards under the monarchy when these  heads of thousands  were appointed by the king instead of the people the want of  juries  became still more apparent for if the process against any man was di∣rected by the king's letters or under his seal as in the case of  Naboth  the judges were tempted to preserve only the mere outward form of the law without the spirit and intention of it they would not  condemn  indeed without a  legal number of witnesses  were set up to accuse but then there was no  jury  to determine whether or not these accusers were  credible wit∣nesses  which the law equally required at that time as it does at present But in every other respect the government of the  Israelitish cities  seems as I have said to have been similar to what our  common law  requires The Rev Dr  Sam Croxall  formerly archdeacon of  Salop  has drawn up an account of the  Rulers of Cities  See his SCRIPTURE POLITICS chap § xv concerning  the  RULERS  of  CITIES p  The  third wheel  of their government which as we mentioned before  turned within the other two  was the constitution and magistracy  of every city within itself  As the weight of superintending the affairs of every  tribe  was much lightened to the  prince  thereof by the subordinate jurisdiction of the  heads of families  the political burden of these latter was in like manner considerably alleviated by the share of authority which appertained to the  rulers of cities  Every tribe having several cities belonging to it and every city being inhabited by a great number of families  The chief magistrate in these corporations was cal∣led the  ruler  of  the city  * * * *  Some have questioned whether there were not more than one of these chief magistrates in every city That there  were many subordinate ones having gradual authority under one another is very plain  and that these were the same whom  Moses  constituted  to be judges of the people in the wilderness  by the advice of  Jethro  his fatherinlaw Exod xviii  He chose able men out of all Israel  but I have already proved that the  able men  were really elected by the people  and made them heads over the people rulers of thousands rulers of hundreds rulers of fifties and rulers of tens  And  they judged the people at all seasons The hard causes they brought unto  Moses  but every small matter they judged themselves  When therefore the tribes came to  have cities belonging to them there these magistrates presided and exercised their jurisdiction  Which consisted princi∣pally of these three parts  First  to  convene and hold senates and councils  in order to enact such  bylaws as were expedient for that body corporate of which they were members  Secondly  to commission and authorise the judges to enter upon and to determine in the judiciary way such small matters as lay properly within their cog∣nizance  And thirdly  to make a part of the great council of the nation as often as it was summoned to as∣semble by that person who held the helm of government  These are they who are intended in that precept where it is said Deut xvi  judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates which the Lord thy God giveth thee throughout thy tribes  Which  officers  we find mentioned upon other occasions Deut xxix  Ye stand this day all of you before the Lord your God your captains of your tribes your elders and your officers  Again  Moses  says Deut xxxi  Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes and your offi∣cers  And we find  Joshua  when he was  old and stricken in age  Joshua xxiii  called for all  Israel  and for their elders and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers  So when  David  calls together the  great congrega∣tion  to declare his purpose about the building of the temple Chron xxviii we read of  the captains over the thousands and the captains over the hundreds with the officers  being summoned upon that occasion And afterwards we are told that  Solomon  made a speech  unto all  Israel Chron i  to the captains of thou∣sands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every governor in all  Israel  the chief of the fathers  And thus when that pious prince  Hezekiah  was resolved upon a reformation both of religion and manners throughout his kingdom it is said Chron xxix  Then  Hezekiah  the king rose early and gathered the ru∣lers of the city and went up to the house of the Lord  As to their judiciary capacity they were not strict∣ly speaking judges themselves but had the power of admitting what causes they thought were proper to come before the judges and of rejecting what they looked upon as frivolous or unnecessary to be enqui∣red into * * * * * *  Of the judiciary authority of these rulers we read farther in the case of  Jeremiah  When another  Micaiah  had heard his prophetical denunciations against  Israel  and  Judah  Jer xxxvi he went down  into the king's house into the scribe's chamber where all the princes  these rulers  were sitting  and inform∣ed them of it And after when  Jeremiah  was going out of the city into the land of Benjamin  Irijah  who suspected that he was going to desert to the army of the  Chaldeans  who were lately broken up from besieging the city Jer xxxvii  took  Jeremiah  and brought him to the princes Wherefore the princes were wroth with  Jeremiah  and smote him and put him in prison  And upon his farther prophesying that  the city should be given into the band of the king of  Babylon  Therefore the princes said unto the king We beseech thee let this man be put to death Then  Zedekiah  the king said Behold he is in your hand for the king is not he that can do any thing against you  Which shews that they bore a mighty sway in the  great council  of the nation and that when they prayed judgement and execution against any one even the king thought it most safe and prudent to comply with them  The number of these  rulers  in every city was in proportion to the number of its inhabitants as many  thousands  as it contained so many  rulers  of that rank and denomination belonged to it from which re∣gulation the estimation and consequence of each city was discernible at one view And from this consideration arises that fine allusion of one of the pro∣phets concerning the place where Christ should be born so understood and applied by  the chief priests  and  scribes  themselves as the Evangelist informs us Mat ii Mic v  But thou  Bethlehem Ephratah  though thou be little among the thousands of  Judah in comparison of those cities that have  rulers of thousands  belonging to them  yet out of thee he shall come forth unto me that is to be ruler in  Israel  whose goings forth have been of old from everlasting  So exactly was almost every minute circumstance relating to the Sa∣viour of mankind delineated and foretold by those divinelyinspired writers who lived so many hun∣dred years before he came into the world * *  Captains of Thousands c  The rest of the officers that governed the army we find called by the titles of  captains of thousands cap∣tains of hundreds captains of fifties and captains of tens  Who probably were of the same rank with those whom  Moses  constituted in the wilderness  rulers of thousands  c and at first acted in a double capa∣city being at the same time civil magistrates and military officers  The  captains of thousands  seem to have been much the same as colonels of regiments with us and the  captains of hundreds  might probably answer to those who in our army have the command of troops and companies the  captains of fifties  and  tens  to our su∣balterns serjeants and corporals  Among the list of  David  's adherents while he fled from  Saul  Chron xii and  kept himself close at  Ziklag after several names mentioned it is said  These were of the sons of God captains of the host one of the least was over an hundred and the greatest over a thousand  Again we read of others said Chron xii to be  captains of the thousands that were of  Manasseh And when  David  had thoughts of bring∣ing the  Ark of God  from  Kirjathjearim  we are told Chron xiii he  consulted with the captains of thou∣sands and hundreds and with every leader  And again when he declared his intentions about build∣ing the temple it is said that he Chron xxviii  assembled all the princes of  Israel  the princes of the tribes and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by course and the captains over the thousands and the captains over the hundreds  So when  Jehoiada  the highpriest had a mind to bring on the restoration by declaring  Joash  to be king Kings xi  he sent for the rulers over hundreds with the captains and the guard and shewed them the king's son  and gave them proper instructions what they were to do  And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that  Jehoiada  the priest com∣manded And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king  David  's spears and shields that were in the temple of the Lord And he took the rulers over hundreds and the captains and the guard and all the people of the land and they brought down the king from the house of the Lord and be sate on the throne of the kings  And we read Kings i of  three captains of fifties  who with their fifties were sent successively by  Ahaziah  king of  Israel  to bring the prophet  Elijah  to him The Apocryphal writings tell us Mac iii that  Judas ordained captains over the peo∣ple even captains over thousands and over hundreds and over fifties and over tens  These officers from the  captain of the host  down to the lowest subaltern appear after the monarchy took place to have received their commissions from the king  Whereas they were before chosen by the people  When  Samuel  declares to the people the  manner  of the king that was to reign over them this is part of it Sam viii  he will appoint him cap∣tains over thousands and captains over fifties  c Ac∣cordingly when  Saul  began to grow jealous of  David  's rising glory Sam xviii  he removed him from him and made him his captain over a thousand  So we read Sam xviii that  David numbered the people that were with him and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them  Chron xxv and that  Amaziah gathered  Judah  together and made them captains over thousands and captains over hundreds  in  Israel ready to my hand which is so sui∣table to my present purpose that I should  do injustice to the subject if I neglected to give my readers some extracts of it in the author's own words  The  military  duties of  watch  and  guard  in cities towns c which by the laws  of K William I were ordered to be per∣formed  "in gyrum"  i e in due  rotation  of service by all the inhabitants as I have already shewn were farther regulated by  the statute of Winchester in the th K Edw I A D which without altering the former law about  rotation  specifies the  strength of the guard  to be set in each place and ordains for I will cite it as abbreviated by Mr Lambard in his  "Duties of Constables"  p which proves that he thought it still in force so late as the reign of Q Elizabeth in that  NIGHT WATCHES  should be kept yearly from the feast of the  ASCENTION  untill  MICHAELMAS by six men at everie gate of everie CITIE  by    men in everie  BOROUGH  towne and in every other  TOWNE  by six men or four men or according to the number of inhabitants in the towne all the night long from sunne setting to sunne rising so that if any stranger did passe he should be ar∣rested till the morning and then set at large if no suspicion were found of him but if any suspicion fel out against him then he should be imprisoned till he might be lawfully delivered And of these  WATCHES  says Mr Lambard  the officers before named have the charge within the limites or places of their auctorities as the  CONSTABLE  in his town the  BORSHOLDER  in his boroe and the  HIGH CONSTABLE  within all his  HUNDRED  and these  officers ought to see  these  WATCHES  says Mr Lam∣bard by which he plainly insists on the con∣tinued  force of this statute so that the enquiry concerning WATCH DUTY at views of Frankpledge ought to be regu∣lated by it  duly set and kept and ought also to cause  HUE  and  CRIE  The  hue  and  crie  was a  military  exertion of the  civil  power which all men were obliged to attend with their  arms  in  military array  whenever legally summoned to do so Even so late as the d  Hen  VII as Mr  Dalton  in his  Officium Vicecomitum  relates  the sheriff's bayliff to execute a  REPLEVY took with him men armed MODO GUERRINO sc with brigandines jackes and guns and  it was holden lawful  says he  for the sheriff's officer hath power to take assistance as well as the sheriff himself  p And a little farther he adds p  and every man is sworn saith Keble to

inflicteth both fine and imprisonment upon such as shall not aid the sheriff they being thereunto re∣quired  This proves that the  military  capacity of every man is required to support the  civil  government  to be raysed after such as will not obey the  ARREST  of such watchmen  This power of ARRESTING suspicious persons in all towns and boroughs shews the ne∣cessity  of having in each town and bo∣rough a proper GOAL or  appointed place of confinement  especially as the common law required  that if any man was of so evil credit that he could not get him∣selfe to be received into one of these  TY∣THINGS  or  BOROES  that then hee should be shut up in  PRISON  as a man un∣worthie to live at liberty amongst men abroad  Lambard's Duties of Con∣stables p And the expences neces∣sary for the building and maintaining such proper  places of confinement  might be levied by the COURT LEET on the in∣habitants of each district for the LEET has competent power according to the common law to  levy taxes  for defraying all necessary public works  See Powell's Treatise of the Antiquity c of Courts of Leet or View of Frankpledge c p  Any  BYLAWES  for the commonweale may be made in a  LEET  and are good  and  will lye against those that do not con∣sent as to make cawseyes highways bridges and such like  And no public works surely are more for the  common weal  or more necessary for enforcing a due compliance with the  common law  than the erection of proper  goals  and  places of confinement  or  houses of correction  and  "of industry"  in lesser districts to prevent the  accu∣mulation of multitudes of prisoners  in the county goals where they mu∣tually  corrupt each other  and to prevent the baneful practice of  selling convicts into foreign slavery  or into miserable torture in floating prisons who according to the common law ought to be punished  only  upon the spot where their offences as well as their contrition and amend∣ment might be known for if there should be still cause to suspect a want of improvement in any of them so that they should not be able to obtain a readmission into any  tithing  of  Frankpledge  the LEETS had ample authority to prolong their imprisonment and to keep them hard at work to defray the expences of a  sober  and  limited  diet the very best mode of inclining reprobates to hear  reason  and  instruction  The indefatigable labours of the benevolent and  truly patriotic  Mr HOWARD who has so disinterestedly devoted both himself and his for∣tune to the  public service  afford ample materials for selecting the most just and effectual means of forming such necessary establishments    th Edward III fol  But a by∣law to repair a church binds none but such as do as∣sent  vid Co fol ALEET  may make  BYLAWES  the lord by

that is here attributed to  the lord of a leet  cer∣tainly belongs also to  sheriffs mayors bailiffs  and  hundred∣ers  or  high constables  who may hold  leets  by the common law and consequently have a right also  by prescrip∣tion to distreyne for the amerciaments and to sell the dis∣tresse  I must also observe that where any lord of a manor hath enjoyed a right of holding a court  leet  and hath either abused or neglected his power the  king  may certainly according to the true limited doctrine of  "Nullum Tempus"  see my separate Tract on that head resume the  right  of the court and all the  profit  of it which is properly  res fiscalis  and must in that case restore the power of the holding the said court to the  high con∣stable  or proper officer by the  common law  so that the  modern usage of applying to the great  national council  on such occasions is clear∣ly  wrong  because it not only occasions a  needless  expence interferes with more important business of the nation and grievously prolongs the sittings of parlia∣ment but also tends to enure the mem∣bers to  private solicitations  in behalf of  partial  objects facilitates the  practice  of  canvassing  them  individually  and thereby lays them open to  influence  and  tempta∣tion  in higher matters whereas  frequent  but SHORT SESSIONS of  newly elected parliaments  like those of ancient times would effectually  cut up the roots of cor∣ruption and undue influence  In order the more effectually to pro∣mote the happy system of government  which I now recommend viz that  ALL  freeborne men  within this kingdom "  shoulde cast themselves into  TITHINGS" see p and for the common se∣curity of ALL it was ordained by king William I  Ut  OMNES  habeant et teneant  LEGEM REGIS EDWARDI  in omnibus

maintaining the  tithings  and  hundreds  are collected and stated  in all things those things being also added which we have ordained  said William  "for the use of the English"  And no free nation could reasonably desire more sub∣stantial and effectual  additions  for the se∣curity of their  own peace  and  liberty  than those  additional  laws of William most  of which I have already cited  That all cities boroughs castles hundreds and wapentaches of our whole kingdom shall be  watched  and  guarded  IN GIRUM  in  rotation  or by a  roster  of service  against malefactors and enemies

far from being enslaved by what is com∣monly called the  conquest  that K Wm's statute expressly submits the efficient power of the kingdom the  national militia  to the orders of parliament And also the clause which I have but just now cited for the regulation of WATCH and WARD  To these I must now add a farther excellent clause of K William's statute  Omnis hemo qui voluerit se teneri pro LIBERO

tertio  alius BOS et si quarto reddatur de rebus hujus ho∣minis quod calumniatum est quod dicitur  ceapgyld  al  orfgyld  quod idem est et insuper regi forisfaci∣tura  which is ne∣cessary  for the better enforcing and pro∣moting K Edward's laws viz that  every man who shall be willing  TO BE DEEM∣ED A FREEMAN  shall be  IN PLEDGE  shall enter himself into some tithing of FRANKPLEDGE  that the pledge may have him to justice if in any thing he should offend and if any of such  pledg∣ed persons  should abscond that the pledges may pay whatsoever damages are laid  or rather are proved  and may clear themselves that they knew  or were privy to  no fraud in the ab∣sconded person Let the  HUNDRED  court  "be demanded"  or summoned  "  and the  COUNTY" court  and those who ought of right to attend  at  either  of these courts as the context requires us to understand  and shall be unwilling let them be summoned  ONCE and if to a SECOND  summons  they shall not come let  ONE OX  be taken  or per∣haps the medium value of one ox at the current marketprice for thus the quan∣tum of the  forfeit  would generally bear a due proportion or nearly so to the true value of money as collegerents are sometimes ascertained by the value of certain quantities of corn  and if to a  THIRD  summons he shall not come let  "another ox"  be taken  and if to a  FOURTH  summons they shall not come  let what is rated be paid out of the effects of this man which is called  CEAPGYLD  CEAPGYLD CEAP in the Saxon tongue signifies  price wages cattle wealth  or  chattles  and GYLD signifies  payment  the compound word CEAPGYLD ac∣cording to Mr Somner signifies  rei furto ablatae pre∣tium  "the price of any thing stolen"  but which in this law must evidently mean the  payment  or  forfeit of the man's reputed wealth  and    or  ORF∣GYLD  so likewise ORFGYLD ORFE signifies  money cattle effects  and the compound word Mr Somner renders  "rei pretium"  the price of any thing  So that I suppose both these words to be sy∣nonymous with the Saxon word    Regular summonses however were required by  law  to be made  seven days before  any of these courts unless a legal and admissable excuse could be as∣signed for the omission  et septem diebus antea  SUMMONIRI  nisi publicum com∣modum vel dominica regis necessitas ter∣minum praeveniat  see K Edward's law de Heretochiis c And a neglect or disregard of a  legal summons to a court of law  might surely be deemed a  contempt of the law  the declared penalties for which a single or double forfeiture of the man's WERE  Were  which is com∣monly rendered  Aestimati  capitis  " not the whole value of a man's  estimated wealth  but only such a  certain rate  according to each man's rank in life as he might justly be supposed  able to pay  in case he should incur a pe∣nalty or forfeit without being  ruined  and degraded by it agreeable to what I have remarked in p and on the due  limitation of amerciaments  by the th chapter of Magna Charta which was certainly the law of the kingdom long before that time Because even in K Edward's laws it appears that a man might be amer∣ced  twice his Were "his Weram suam"  for a second offence and  all that he was worth  for a  third  offence so that a man's  Were  or estimated price was certainly very far within the compass of his real wealth or substance And therefore all these  amerciaments  must necessarily be understood to have been levied strictly according to the  spirit  of what was afterwards ordained in Magna Charta i e  saving to a man  according to his rank his CONTENEMENT or MERCHANDISE or  wainage  with∣out degrading him from his rank and means of liveli∣hood except the same crime was obstinately repeated and such  amerciaments were to be made only by the oath of honest and lawful men of the vicinage  according to the regular usage of all the ancient  leets  and popular courts The great object of  amerciaments  was to com∣pel  men of all ranks  to respect and observe the laws whence arose the necessity of varying the quantum of the  mulct  in due proportion to the offender's  ability to pay  with∣out actually depressing or degrading him from his rank and of this  due proportion  a jury of the vicinage were the only proper judges  may perhaps help to explain  the nature of the  amerciaments  mention∣ed above for neglect of  summonses  Et qui leges apostabit  i e violarit  si fuerit  Anglicus vel Dacus vel Waliscus vel Albanicus vel insulicola  WERAE  suae reus sit apud regem et si  SECUNDO  id faciat reddat  BIS WERAM SUAM  et si quid addat  TERTIO  reus sit omnium quae habebit  And whosoever shall neglect  or violate  the laws whether he be Englishman Dane Welchman or Scot or islander shall forfeit his  WERE  with the king and if he shall do it a  SECOND TIME  let him pay  TWICE HIS WERE  and if he shall add a  THIRD TIME  i e a third repetition of the same offence  let him forfeit all that he shall have  To increase  amerciaments  on the repe∣tition of  offences  seems to be both just and necessary but whether in so enlarged a proportion as that of  doubling the Were  for a second conviction and forfeiting  all  on a third may reasonably be questioned especially as there is no express exception for second and third offences in the  limi∣tation of americaments  ordained by the th chapter of  magna charta  Nevertheless if we consider that a frequent  repetition  of the  same misdemeanor  is undoubtedly a  heinous aggravation  of it and that it was always so considered  in the common law  and punished accordingly by an  aggra∣vation of the mulct  as appears by the  laws  already cited we shall perhaps be in∣clined to believe that the authors of the said  limitation of mulcts  in Magna Charta though they certainly intended to regu∣late by it the pecuniary penalties of  crimes in general  yet for any thing that appears they had not in contemplation the peculiar circumstance of a  contemptuous repetition  of any crime and may there∣fore be justly supposed not to have intend∣ed to abridge the salutary spirit of the  common law  so necessary for its own pre∣servation in duly punishing by gradual advances of severity any  repeated contempts  of its authority  If all these points be duly considered it must appear that our  common law  is al∣ready vested with  ample powers  to enforce a  revival  of the ancient constitution of this  kingdom so that nothing is wanting but a general communication of its principles the purpose of this tract to engage THE WILL OF THE PUBLIC for its reassumption that the  SUMMA ET MAXIMA SECURI∣TAS  of our ancestors see p may be once more established the happy ef∣fects of which cannot be expressed in stronger terms than in the words of Sir Edw Coke on this very subject  By the due execution of this law  says he speaking of the VIEW  of  FRANKPLEDGE in his comment on Magna Charta p d inst  such peace whereof this chap∣ter speaketh was universally holden within this realme as no injuries homi∣cides robberies thefts riots tumults or other offences were committed so as a man with a white wand might safely have ridden before the conquest with much money about him without any wea∣pon throughout England and one saith  truly  Referring to Mr Lambard's explanation of Aes∣TIMATIO CAPITIS  conjectur a est eaque non levis haud it a multis scatuisse prisca tempora sceleribus quippe quibus rapinae furto coedi  Caedi or  manslaughters  if he meant  voluntary  slaugh∣ters or  murders  ought not to have been mentioned here as crimes formerly punished only by  pecuniary mulcts  for though I am well aware that many eminent lawwriters have  supposed  this as well as the learned Mr Lambard and the excellent lawyer who quoted him and though perhaps too many instances may be cited of such a corrupt usage sometimes prevailing in ancient times so as to strengthen the  supposition  yet it never was  the law  since the establishment of christianity but a real  perver∣sion  of the law whenever it was done which must have been occasioned either by corrupt  partiality  or  favour  from the officers of the crown or through their  ignorance  and want of due  discrimination  to be aware of the parti∣cular circumstances of  manslaughters  wherein fines or  mulcts  might sometimes legally take place as in  invo∣luntary manslaughters  to make men more careful of each others lives and even in cases of  accidental deaths  where∣in the  deodands  were in the nature of  mulcts  and also the particular circumstances when  mulcts  might be levied for  actual murder  which was only when the murderer  had fled and could not be taken that a certain sum should be paid for him and should be collected because they had not taken the killer  c  "Si autem aufugeret" i e interfector  et capi non posset s  lverentur pro co marcae et colligebantur in  villa  ubi quis esset  interfectus  et ideo quia  interfectorem  non habuerunt et si in tali  villa  pro paupertate colligi non possent colligerentur in  hundredo  in the∣sauro regis  deponendae  Bract lib c NB The fines were to be  deposited  in the exchequer  deponendae  and not appropriated for a year and a day lest the  murderers  should in the mean time be taken in which case the fines were to be returned to the town or  hundred  as will hereafter be shewn  But if he could be taken the same law declared  "fieret de eo justitia"  let justice be done upon him and the only  justice  in the laws of GOD and  man  for such a crime was and is the  retribution of death  The learned judge Bracton copied from K Ed∣ward's laws this very expression concerning a convict∣ed murderer  "sieret de eo justitia"  as also the alterna∣tive when the murderer could not be taken  si autem aufugeret  SOLVERETUR  ut supra dictum est  see leges Edouardi regis c The doctrine here referred to by the words  "ut supra dictum est"  is in the preceding chapter of king Edward's laws viz N  o  entitled  Lex Murdrorum  to the following effect  Si quispiam  murdratus  alicubi reperiebatur querebatur apud villam ubi inveniebatur interfector illius Qui si inveniri poterat  trade∣batur justitiae regis  infra ipsos dies interfectionis Si vero  inveniri non peterat  mensis et unius diei respectum habebant ad eum perqui∣rendum Quod si intra terminum non inveniebatur colligebantur in villa illa Marcae Quod si ad tantae solutionem pecuniae non sufficiebat  per hundredum colligebatur  quod in  villa  non poterat Veruntamen quoniam omnino  villa  confundebatur providerunt barones quod  per hundredum  colligerentur et sigillo al  cujus Baronis comitatus sigillarentur et ad Thesaurarium Regis deportarentur quas sigillatus  perhaps for  sigillatas    ipse servaret per annum et diem unum quod si infra hunc terminum possit murdrator haberi  traderetur justitiae regis et ipsi marcas Thesaurario Regis commenda  as rehaberent  So that the fine appears manifestly to be intended for no other purpose than to induce the inhabitants to  bring the murderer to justice    Sin infra tempus annuum non posset teneri parentes murdrati sex marcas haberent rex quadraginta c c  that if a mur∣dered person was any where found enquiry was made after the murderer who if he could be found within eight days he was to be  delivered to the justice of the king  But if he could not be found the inhabitants had a respite  respectus  of a month and a day to search for him Within which term if he was not found the marks beforementioned were to be collected in the town or if so large a sum could not there be raised throughout  the hundred  and to be delivered sealed up to the king's treasurer who was to keep them sealed up for a year and a day that if within this term the mur∣derer could be taken he should be DELIVERED TO THE JUSTICE OF THE KING and the marks were to be  re∣turned  So that  justice  and not the fine was manifest∣ly the object for otherwise some farther provision would have been made that the fine should  not be re∣turned  to the innocent inhabitants until the abilities of the guilty person to make it good were ascertained And besides  the justice of the king  could not  legally  be deferred because the law ordained that  "justice should be done"  upon the murderer  "fieret de eo justitia"  and there could be no other  justice  to expiate the crime of murder except  the blood  of the criminal  after the laws of God  were acknowledged by our Anglo Saxon ancestors so that the king could not remit the due punishment either  for a fine  or  through favour  without drawing upon  his own head  a share of the  guilt of blood  And as a proof of this the crime of  wilful killing  or  murder  was in the laws of K Canute deemed  OTELESS  that is  UNE  ∣  IABLE which is amply demonstrated by the learned Mr justice Aland in the preface to his edit▪ of Fortes∣cue's Treatise on  the difference between an

SHARP        Glory in the highest to GOD  And on Earth PEACE  Towards Men GOODWILL  TRACT Number II  An ABSTRACT from the preceding Account of the  Hundreds  and  Tithings  presented by the author to the com∣mittee of delegates from the several counties c and entituled  A PROPOSAL For removing the enormous disproportion of popular representation enjoyed by the corrupt and venal boroughs which Boroughs are now vested or monopoli∣zed in the hands of a few individuals as  private property  a property avowedly estimated by the value of  the seats in par∣liament  instead of the only lawful pro∣perty therein  the real rentals of the tene∣ments  and at that unlawful and ex∣orbitant estimation notoriously  bought and sold  to the disgrace and perversion of parliamentary authority  THE present great national evil the notorious  misrepresentation  of the commons in parliament cannot  safely  be remedied or altered for the purpose of amendment by any other mode than that of reverting back to the first prin∣ciples of the constitution and by revi∣ving the  ancient rights  of all denomina∣tions or classes of the people at the same time carefully rejecting every  inno∣vation  that is not  consistent in principle  with the  ancient usages  of the realm of which the  certain effects  are already known whereas no human prudence can insure the  real  tendency and final effect of  an innovation  in matters of state howsoever plausible it may at first appear  Though all true friends to the cause of liberty and the  natural rights  of man∣kind would wish that  every man  should vote for his representative in the national council without any other description of  right  or qualification than that of  being a man  yet if this has not already been  the usage  of the realm it is not perhaps  adviseable  at least at present to be adoptedWe know not what would be the effects of it probably  they would be good  but we ought to walk in a trodden path and build on sure founda∣tions  That  every man  as such if he was but an inhabitant of  a county  did formerly vote in  the court  of that county called the  plein county  or  full county  at elections for  the knights  of the shire seems pro∣bable by the description of  very great  outrageous  and  excessive number of peo∣ple dwelling within the same counties  c voting at such elections  as men∣tioned in the act of Hen VI cap which restrained the right of voting for knights to the freeholders of s per ann lands or tenements  But a just definition of  terms  will best shew what description of persons have an unquestionable  right to vote for repre∣sentatives  according to the fundamental principles of the constitution  The titles of  freeholder  and  libertenens  are  ambiguous  terms not sufficiently de∣scriptive of the rank intended to be ex∣pressed for they are applied at present only to  landowners  that is to those who have at least a  lifeinterest  in  lands  or houses which last as being built on  land  do equally intitle the proprietor to the rank of a  landowner  but these ambiguous terms  freeholders  and  liberi tenentes  have sometimes been applied also to the  freerenters of tenements by the year  in contradistinction to the  tenants at will  and  holders in villenage  for the old Saxon  freoborges  or  freeburgesses  that is the  free pledges  of the realm were equally  free  in their condition with those persons we now call  freeholders  though the  tenure  of many of them was  not per∣manent  they being by far the greatest part of them only the  renters of tene∣ments by the year  though indeed the  landowners  themselves those that were  housekeepers  or  householders  must have been included under the same general description of  freoborges  Sir Edward Coke defines the meaning of the word  burgh  to be  because  it  send∣eth burgesses to parliament  and though this is not the proper derivation of the word it is certainly the  ancient usage  of all  boroughs  as well as the  right  of all  burgesses  or  freoborges  For  burghs  were originally named from burgesses  or  freoborges  i e  freepledges  "It was in former times"  says Sir Edward Coke speaking of the word BURGH  taken for those compa∣nies of ten families which were one another's pledge and therefore a pledge in the Saxon tongue a  BORHOE  whereof some take it that  a BURGH  came  c  where∣of also cometh  HEADBOROUGH or BORROWHEAD  ca∣pitalis plegius a  CHIEF PLEDGE viz  the chief man of the  BORHOE  c Co Lit p  in their collective capacity in  tithings  and  hun∣dreds  many of which might be included in one  borough  and not vice versa the  burgesses  from the  burghs  which at pre∣sent is commonly understood and may indeed in some cases of the more modern boroughs incorporated by charters be really the fact  A different etymology may also be assigned to many towns the names of which end with  berg  or  burg  which signifies a  fortification  or castle from the Greek  of which the learned Sheringham has given some in∣stances in his tract de Anglorum Gentis origine p    In the great annual courts of  Frank∣pledge  throughout the kingdom  every housekeeper  was incorporated with nine other neighbouring  housekeepers  arch∣bishops  bishops peers and other great men excepted who  pledged  their own  households  and were supposed in law to have a  tithing  within their own families but all other  householders  or  renters of houses per annum  were incorporated in distinct legal associations called  tithings  or  decenaries  from the incorporated num∣ber of  housekeepers  in each and though all youths of or years of age as also lodgers journeymen and male ser∣vants were likewise obliged to attend the great annual court of  frankpledge  and be there sworn to the king's peace and be also regularly included in the  de∣cenary  and trained in the use of arms to∣gether with the  ten  housekeepers in whose families they were respectively included and numbered yet the  ten housekeepers only  were properly  freoborges  because they were the responsible persons who  pledged all the rest  and had a fixed habitation and  certain interest in the state paying scot and lot being liable to all  national  as well as  county  and  parish  rates  And these ten  Freeborgs  of each  tithing  were still farther distinguished by the title of  deciners  i e  decenarii  a term very properly expressive of their rank and quality as fixed and permanent members of a  decenary  consisting of  ten  such asso∣ciated members one of which was an∣nually elected  chief of the ten  or  tithing∣man  The term  deciner  has been very much mistaken and misrepresented by law wri∣ters some applying it merely to the head∣borough or  capitalisfriborgus  the  ti∣thingman  or head of each ten  freebur∣gesses  and others again to  every man  that was included in a  tithing  which is a gross abuse of the term for a  tithing  may consist of many more than  ten  even or males yet the  ten housekeepers  who are principally responsible and there∣by actually constitute the  decenary  both in number and title those  ten  alone are properly the  deciners  of a  tithing  Again the word  denizen  has strangely puzzled the etymologists who have sought its derivation some from the French tongue others again from the antient  British  but both equally in vain For though it appears that the  Britons  had the term  denizen  in use amongst them before the coming in of the AngloSaxons yet as all the  Roman colonies  established among the Britons were not only divided into  centuriae  or  hundreds  but had also their  decuriones  and consequently  decena∣ries  also for the captain of  the ten  could not be without  the nine  whom he headed both in their  civil  and  military  govern∣ment it is clear that the term  denizen  is of pure  Latin  original from the nume∣ral adjective  deni  forming the Latin verb  denizo  to express the adoption of any per∣son into all the franchises and rights of a  decenary  And our lawwriters have re∣gularly used the participle  denizatus  and the derivative substantive  denizatio  to ex∣press the introduction of  aliens  to the fran∣chises of naturalborn subjects and yet they have not perceived the obvious mean∣ing of these words both in sense and sound  For the alien is admitted by  denization  to all the rights of mutual protection en∣joyed by the community of natives in their established  decenaries  and if he then becomes a housekeeper and one of the  ten  housekeepers who jointly constitute a tithing or  decinary  he is of course a  deciner  and with other  deciners  is an incorporated member of the county which he inhabits for as the  hundreds  are the constituent parts of the  county  and the  tithings  the constituent parts of each  hundred  it necessarily follows that the  deciners  are suitors of the  countycourts  which right at present is very improperly attributed to the  freeholders  or more pro∣perly to the  landowners  alone for the right of the deciners or  free burgesses  to the countycourts is demonstrated by the examples which have been given of gene∣ral elections for  knights citizens and burgesses all together promiscuously in the countycourts  which I have recommend∣ed in a former tract  See  Equitable Representation necessary to the Establishment of Law Peace and good government  c p  as  one  means of reducing the enormous disproportion of representation at present enjoyed by some particular  boroughs  to the effectual dis∣franchisement of all the rest whereby the kingdom has lost the means of expres∣sing the  sense of the people  in parliament and the king has been  deluded  by majorities of alternate factions factions which falsely calling themselves  the commons of  England  have plunged the nation into desperate measures and enormous ex∣pences and thereby loaded it with a bur∣den which it cannot possibly bear and re∣trieve without a speedy reformation  Though the representatives of cities are now called  citizens  yet it appears that all cities and large towns have their right of voting as being ancient  boroughs  that is they had their right of voting from the inhabitants being  freoborges  or  freepledges  of each other in their respective  decenaries  as  deciners  and their right of becoming  deciners  arose from their be∣ing  householders  paying certain rent per annum  or  paying each of them year∣ly an annual rent  for that is the true definition of  burgagetenure  as described by Littleton and therefore not only  householders  whose houses are their own property but also EVERY RENTER OF A HOUSE OR TENEMENT  who is equally  liable to bear the burdens of the state by being rated to all public and parochial taxes  OUGHT TO BE ADMITTED TO VOTE FOR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES IN PARLIA∣MENT a right which they anciently enjoyed  For of such  OLD  towns call∣ed  BOROUGHS says Littleton p b  come the  BURGESSES  of the parliament when the king hath summoned his par∣liament  The  ancient city  of Westminster and many other cities  For the towns that now be  cities  or counties in old time were  boroughes  and called  boroughes  for of such old townes called boroughs come the burgesses of the parliament c  Lit p b  as well as the  an∣cient borough  of Southwark still retain the original usage and rights of  burgagetenure  the mere  renters of houses  or  house∣holders  throughout  all the parishes  respec∣tively included in each being still entitled to vote by ancient prescription which clearly proves the original nature of  bur∣gagetenure  though it is very much alter∣ed  in some other places partly through the encroachments of  purchasers of bo∣roughs  to reduce the number of voters and partly by granting exclusive privi∣leges to a  few people  in the incorporated chartered boroughs  The shortest and most easy mode of restoring to  all the householders of this realm their ancient right of voting  is first to restore their ancient capacity of DECINERS by advising them to  throw themselves  into tithings or  decenaries  and to hold an∣nual courts of  Frankpledge  now too long neglected for the  renewal  and continual preservation of the  tithing associations  By this means both the  civil  and  mili∣tary  government of the people will be completely restored and peace and de∣fence will be completely secured so that  housebreaking  and  robbery  will no longer be known amongst us for such was  once  the happy state of the kingdom and ef∣fected  by the  very same  regulations here recommended A farther advantage by restoring this ancient legal and con∣stitutional mode of government will be that the exact proportions of the people in each county who have a  right to vote  will be truly ascertained whereby may  hereafter  be introduced a representation of all the counties  perfectly equal  in pro∣portion to their respective numbers of  householders  for if in each county divi∣sions were formed consisting each of  decenaries  or  tithings  including householders each that proportion will be found on calculation to contain the most convenient and proper number to be joined in the election of  one deputy  for parliament in order to obtain an  equal representation  of  all the families in the king∣dom  and no persons will be excluded but servants and others who have  no fixed habitation of their own  and consequently  at present have no permanent interest in the state or at least do not bear so large a proportion of relief to its burdens as the  housekeepers  do  Two thousand  families might well af∣ford to pay ample wages to  one  represen∣tative and the stipend might be very easily collected if the  decenaries  were duly formed and established and the several courts which regularly arise from the  de∣cenaries  viz the  hundred courts  and those which might most conveniently be added to superintend and regulate the  hundred courts  viz the court of  one thousand  families answering to those of the Israelitish commonwealth the  thou∣sands  of Ephraim the  thousands  of Judah and lastly the junction of TWO  such courts of the thousand for the election of  ONE  re∣presentative  This last proposed court of  householders  would probably be  equal to what some of the old  trithing courts  formerly were which are said to have sometimes included the third or fourth part of a county  If every division of  families  were to elect  one  deputy to represent them in the great  common council  of the kingdom the whole number of  representatives  for South Britain would amount accord∣ing to the present state of population to about  This calculation is formed from the account of the number of houses charged chargeable and excused in viz See Dr Price's Observations on the Population of England and Wales p In my former proposal from which this is extracted where I make the number of representatives amount to I have for the sake of a round number followed Dr Price's advice when he says concerning the number of houses in p  let it however he stated  says he  at a million  by which there would be a profitable reduction of members  This would be no  innovation  because the election would still be vested where it ought viz in  all the free householders  or  freeborges of all  the counties and that in the most  perfect proportion  of  equality  and this order of  equity  would not be liable to change or to be corrupted because the number of deputies or delegates would rise or fall in due proportion with the de∣gree of population in each county from time to time  GRANVILLE SHARP  TRACT Number III  Being a  Memorandum  on a late Proposal for a New Settlement to be made on the Coast of AFRICA recommend∣ing to the Author of that Proposal several Alterations in his Plan and more especially the adoption of the an∣cient Mode of Government by  Tithings  or Decenaries and  Hundreds  as being the most useful and effectual Mode of Government for all Nations and Coun∣tries  THE proposal for a settlement on the coast of Africa will deserve all en∣couragement if the settlers are  absolutely prohibited from holding any kind of proper∣ty in the persons of men as slaves and from selling either man woman or child  Even  to claim  any human person as  a slave  ought to be considered as an affront to the whole community and be punished ac∣cordingly  With respect to the proposal for leave to  purchase slaves  the permission if grant∣ed at all must be very carefully guarded and the price given must be considered and declared at the time of purchase to be a mere  pecuniary debt for redemption  due from the person purchased to the society or state of the settlement and by  no means to be tranferred to any single individual which would introduce do∣mestic tyranny and traffic in the bodies of men but the debt to be discharged at leisure without increase or interest whenever the redeemed or his friends shall tender the amount of the first price in default of which the price should be worked out by a limited proportional ser∣vice to the state and the state should hold forth at the same time ample encou∣ragement to engage compliance and sub∣mission but it should be an established principle that the state or society ought rather to lose the value of the purchase than  by compulsion to enforce involuntary servitude  whereby honest labour that should always be deemed honourable is rendered odious and slavish  Rules must also be laid down to prevent  the monopoly of land  within the bounds of the settlement and a sufficient reserve of  land  must be made for public services  schools and religious instruction  in each township and for  cottage land  to be dis∣tributed in small parcels to new settlers and redeemed captives which parcels  must revert to the state or community for the same benevolent investiture to others of the like condition  as soon as the temporary possessors are enabled to purchase larger lots for it will prevent in some degree the monopoly of land if the  cottagelots  are untenable with other land  Common land  should also be reserved for a com∣petent distance round each town and village wherein  all inhabitants  rich and poor should have an  equal personal right  because  the claims of rich landholders  when made in proportion to the size of their bordering estates is unreasonable and unjust and has occasioned a cruel perversion of the utility of common lands in England for the live stocks of rich  farmers occasionally turned loose upon the commons generally deprived the cattle of the poor inhabitants of their ne∣cessary sustenance and the late divisions for enclosures by act of parliament ha∣ving been for the most part inconsiderate∣ly granted in the same unjust proportions have at length nearly annihilated  the com∣mon lands of England  whereas on the contrary the large possessions of the neighbouring landholders ought in rea∣son and natural justice rather to have ex∣cluded them from the least share in the inheritance of the poor inhabitants or at most their share should have been  merely personal  as men and individuals  equal to  but not exceeding the claims of their neighbours that the  common lands  might be truly  in common  The managers entrusted with the so∣ciety's property to form the settlement should have no settled dominion or au∣thority  over the people as governors or judges but should be contented with that superiority and influence which their pecuniary trust as agents and overseers for the society will naturally afford them and their services may be amply rewarded and encouraged after the first year's sala∣ry by an admission to a due proportion or share with the members of the society in the general profits of the settlement and in the profits of the common or public trade of the society but  no private trade  whatsoever should be permitted to any of the society's managers and agents  The officers for internal government as the governor or mayor the sheriffs and other magistrates constables c c should be  freely elected every year by all the inhabitants  due qualifications being premised to render men eligible to offices of dignity and trust  The purposes of the defence legislation public justice government and subordi∣nation of the settlers and their union as a community however large and exten∣sive the settlements may hereafter become are points more easily to be accomplished than is generally conceived provided the antient AngloSaxon government by  mu∣tual frankpledge  in  tithings  ordecenaries and  hundreds  A short yet very comprehensive and wellstated account of this ancient mode of government was publish∣ed in the year on the spur of an occasion which too clearly demonstrated the lamentable want of this excellent institution I mean the dangerous riots in that year which could not have proceeded to such an alarm∣ing excess had not this institution been long disused for otherwise  "the civil power"  as the sensible author remarks  would have fully guarded us from its out∣rages  p "I ascribe" says he in letter II p  the complete formation of those general out∣lines by which we have ever defined the English constitution to  Alfred  on the authority of historians who specify the particular regulations which rendered his government so happy as well as glorious which have been in some degree preserved amidst violent and numerous revolutions to which every English∣man has an unconquerable partiality and the resto∣ration of which to their proper vigour and effect would secure our persons and property and preserve that peace and order which are so essential to the hap∣piness of the community  Keeping in view those general those beautiful outlines which were formed by the institutions of our early ancestors over which the people sighed when broken and deformed by the Norman conquest by the bloody contests of the houses of Lancaster and York by the tyranny of the house of Tudor and the folly of that of Stuart and an attention to which alone rendered the revolution a blessing we must define an English citizen to be a freeman who is to owe his protection and the security of his family and property to a civil government of which he is an essential member  You will observe Sir that I confine myself to one object or one part of our constitution which pro∣vided for the safety of individuals and the preser∣vation of order by the following regulations still existing in names and forms the revival of which would be the most beneficial and popular act of go∣vernment which can well be imagined  The whole kingdom was as it is now divided into COUNTIES HUNDREDS and TITHINGS  Ten families  were associated their names entered their occupations defined the males in them from eighteen to fifty or sixty years of age pledged themselves for the security of the  tithing  and to obey the summons of the  decennary  or  tithingman  on the least apprehen∣sion of danger They were furnished with such arms as the times afforded  The perfect knowledge which every neighbour∣hood had of its inhabitants the concern which every man had in the security of every man and the obli∣gation which every decennary was under to be an∣swerable for his tithing either prevented all viola∣tions of peace and order or corrected them at their first origin  All the decennaries or tithingmen were  chosen by the people  once ayear and this is an  essential  circum∣stance in the institution  The ten tithingmen of every district called a hun∣dred because it contained a hundred families chose a person to preside over the hundred to whom they made their appeals and who had a power of calling them out All these were amenable to the earl or count who governed the county and he was amenable to the king who either by the  earl or by the sheriff both of which were of his own appointment  The worthy author in this point is mistaken the sheriff as well as the earl and  heretock  were in ancient times  chosen by the people  could call out the whole force of a county or of any number of counties as the public exigencies required while the internal peace and order of each district was pro∣vided for without his interference and in a manner perfectly consistent with his general authority and in∣fluence  Nothing has ever been imagined more simple in its construction or more effectual in the execution than this part of the English constitution The several powers of it which in most cases are in eternal dis∣cord are here so happily blended that the people are secure and free the king's power extends to every thing but mischief and is in reality greater than can be obtained on any other plan  These regulations might be easily restored and ren∣dered as effectual as ever The prepossessions of the people are strongly in their favour and perhaps no others can be contrived which will not set the body of the people  at enmity  with government which will perfectly allay their apprehensions and jealousies will make them the ministers of their own security while the power of the king  reaches every individual of them by a chain every link of which is effectual  and  will not interfere with the prerogative of the king in other departments of the state  however the business of them may be administered * * * *  "If you mean that it is impracticable" says he in letter III  because the inhabitants of this country are too far advanced in luxury too indolent too effemi∣nate to enter on any plan of security which will re∣quire the least trouble or put them to the least incon∣venience and if you can ascertain this fact I have no answer to make But the trouble and inconve∣nience are such as would not be complained of by women What is it but an amusement to learn the common use of arms What inconvenience to sub∣mit to such regulations as may bring together a neigh∣bourhood a parish the ward of a city a town a district c to clear them of vagabonds occasionally to assist the civil magistrate and to lay the basis of a general security confidence and strength where it ought to be laid in the whole body of the people  I will venture to affirm that there is no other me∣thod by which disturbances riots and insurrections can be prevented without debasing the people into the condition of brutes and there is no other me∣thod by which a king may hold every man in the na∣tion in his hands while every man in the nation would feel and know himself to be as free as it is pos∣sible he should be in society  Hints have been thrown out of acts of parliament which render such associations as I recommend ille∣gal but the acts are not specified I know there are laws forbidding a man's going armed in a time of tranquillity and peace without leave from a magis∣trate and specifying such assemblies of people as are dangerous and seditious but without the most dis∣tant reference to the right which every man has from nature from the connivance of the most despotic go∣vernments and from the express provisions of the English constitution to provide for his own defence and that of his family and to unite with his neigh∣bourhood under the eye and direction of the supreme magistrate for the general peace and order of the community  If there were such laws as you mention they could not possibly have effect against not only  a necessary right or nature but an essential principle of the English constitution  If a law were made that because it is  possible  an English elector may become venal there∣fore all electors must relinquish the right of voting would this constitute an obligation Will any man say that the legislature is competent to the making of such a lawhow much less to annihilate the first and most important principles of human society by awarding that as it is possible men may make an improper use of their limbs or their arms which may be as necessary as their limbs they must therefore suffer them to be  taken off  The power of the legislature like every power in human society is limited by certain and accurate bounds it may exceed these bounds and commit absurdities and even offences The English legis∣lature is just as competent to make a law by which every Englishman may be banished to the Orkneys or put to death as it is to enjoin the people to give up the right of selfdefence and preservation by the use of their limbs or by the use of arms  The apprehension that associations will produce commotions and riots instead of preventing them must be pretended only And all the arguments for depriving the people of the right of associating be∣cause they have often assembled for mischievous pur∣poses are delusive Cardinal de Retz says that all numerous assemblies are mobs and I will add that all mobs are mischievous Let the people who might form such assemblies  be divided into small bo∣dies and though the individuals be not improved they will act reasonably and well  The design of associa∣tions is to  prevent large and tumultuous assemblies to arrange the people under the eye of government  as accu∣rately as an army  without diminishing their constitutional independence and liberty  to increase the difficulty of misleading them and to destroy all ideas of  appeals to them  Here I beg to be understood not as aiming at any of the rights of the people but the idea of an  appeal to them  has been borrowed from the government of  Rome  in England it is like the introduction of mi∣litary force a thing that negligence or mismanage∣ment may render  necessary  but the constitution is perfect without it no supposition is made of the pos∣sibility of having any occasion to make it and when∣ever it is made the remedy may be as hazardous as any evil it can be designed to remove A whole nation like the human body in order to act with harmony and pleasure  must be divided into small parts each having its local power subject to the direction and controul of the general will  p to  be duly adopted and this  being already consistent with the common law and antient constitution of this king∣dom  still deemed  legal  though not in use might be lawfully established even if the  settlement is made within the boundaries of the present English claims but in  that case the legal process in all the courts of justice must be carried on in  the king's name and the settlers may not refuse to admit a governor or lieu∣tenant  of the king's appointment with a  limited  delegation of authority accord∣ing to the constitution of England when∣ever  the privy council shall think proper to send one  But if the settlement be attempted in any other part of Africa not claimed by European powers the managers must first obtain the consent and association if possible of the native inhabitants or else the establishment must be made on an uninhabited part of the coast and as the majority of the settlers will probably be negroes returned from slavery and op∣pression to their  native  soil there will be no necessity to form the plan of govern∣ment strictly by the constitutional model of England any farther than reason and experience may suggest the adoption of some particular parts of it but we may in that case assume the liberty of draw∣ing a precedent for government from more antient and more perfect documents than our Saxon records viz from the example or rather the original intention of  the Is∣raelitish  commonwealth  purified and im∣proved by the general precepts and  maxims of the gospel  and by the example of  free congregational government amongst the pri∣mitive Christians  who decided their own temporal litigations and differences    "things pertaining to this life"  Cor vi as well as ecclesiastical questions in their regular assemblies of  all the people  which method was an ancient ethnic custom derived probably from patriarchal times as appears by the ex∣ample of the pagan Ephesians recorded in Acts xix whom their townclerk referred to  a lawful assembly    apparently distinct as the context proves from their  ordinary courts of jus∣tice  then subject to the Romans for the  examination  and  resolution  of all extraor∣dinary questions  The Israelitish government under the theocracy was administered by  freelyelect∣ed  judges and officers  see my tract on the Law of Nature p to through∣out all the tribes and cities or gates ex∣cept in the extraordinary cases of prophe∣tical judges though these were probably  elected  likewise as soon as their superior or supernatural abilities became gene∣rally known  They had a regular gradation of official power heads of  tens  of  fifties  of  hun∣dreds  and of  thousands  besides the pro∣vincial governors who were ancient heads of houses or tribes these altogether formed  one great band of allegiance  uni∣ting the whole community together for  action and defence  as  one man  with  one mind  viz by the free resolutions of the majority the smaller divisions being re∣gularly included and controuled in the lar∣ger and the individuals of all the divi∣sions being mutually bound to each other by the reciprocal ties or allegiance of  frankpledge  which our Saxon ancestors and many other even savage and heathen nations  The Romans had their  decuriones  and  centuriones  not only in their  military  but also in their  civil  govern∣ment and consequently they must have had the popu∣lar divisions of  tithings  and  hundreds  much in the same manner as those established by K Alfred in England in imitation of the Israelitish commonwealth and even the  Chinese  and  Japonese  it is said have  tithings  to this day  have in some degree maintain∣ed probably from the patriarchal times For all men having  the knowledge of good and evil  are capable of this form of go∣vernment if it is once properly explain∣ed to them and established and there is no mode of defending restraining and keeping in order a promiscuous body of men so cheap so easy or so certainly effec∣tual for every profitable purpose as that of  mutual government  by the principles and maxims of  right  in such equal propor∣tioned congregations each of which is a constituent part or member of a more powerful congregation in the great  unity  or  commonwealth  wherein every indivi∣dual however violent or morose in him∣self is prevented from injuring others by having his person and his property render∣ed answerable for all damages which he either occasions by his own rapacious vio∣lence or caprice or which he does not endeavour to prevent in others as a mem∣ber of the  tithing  wherein any violence or offence is committed for according to the law of  frankpledge  no man is en∣titled to  liberty  Omnis homo qui voluerit se teneri PRO LIBERO sit in  plegio  ut  plegius  eum habeat ad justitiam si quid offenderit  c See Lambard's Archionomia p b  that is not duly  pledged by his nearest neighbours  for the mutual conservation of  peace  and  right  Under this form of government all public works as entrenchments or  earth∣works  and  fortifications  to secure the towns and strengthen the country ca∣nals and highways for public passage sewers and drains for the general health  of the country c may be formed and maintained by  a rotation of service  in which the value of daily attendance must be estimated that defaulters may bear their share or rather a  double share  of the burden and the expence of  watch and ward  or  military service  must be defray∣ed in the same manner by which means no debt will be incurred for the defence of the state Rich funds may also be ob∣tained to support the credit of a public exchequer without laying any percepti∣ble burden on the community by a ge∣neral agreement to punish by fines and mulcts in due proportion to the wealth and possessions of delinquents increasing likewise by repetition for all offences as well of  omission  or neglect of public duty as of  commission  except for mur∣der rapes and unnatural crimes which by the laws of God are unpardonable by  any community The people themselves to be  judges  people of the vicinage un∣exceptionably disinterested liable be∣sides to the challenge of the parties and duly  sworn  according to the known laws of English  juries  to do  right  in the pre∣sence of the ordinary judges and officers elected to preside and keep order in the assemblies  GRANVILLE SHARP  Old Jewry  Aug  TRACT Number IV  An easy and practicable Plan for laying out Settlements on uncultivated Lands in e∣qual Divisions of  ten Tithings  or Families each whereby new Colonies may be most advantageously formed and extended in regular Districts of  Hun∣dreds  agreeable to the ancient legal Di∣visions of our AngloSaxon Ancestors  SEVERAL years ago I made some me∣morandums of  A Method of form∣ing frontier Settlements  which I co∣pied from the second edition of a book first printed at Philadelphia but reprinted at London in and intituled  An Historical Account of the Expedition against the Ohio Indians in the Year    under the Command of Henry Bouquet Esq to which are annexed Military Papers containing Reflections on the War with the Savages a Method of forming frontier Settlements  c  My reference for the lastmentioned sub∣ject is to p of the said book but as I have not the book itself at present I cannot pretend to be perfectly accurate in my quotations from it neither do I re∣member  whether the author recommend∣ed a government by  tithing  and  hundred  courts with their proper officers accord∣ing to the AngloSaxon model but only that his proposed settlements were happily for my present purpose laid out in equal divisions of  one hundred  lots each for the maintenance of  one hundred  families so that of course the constitutional regu∣lations for  hundreds  recommended in the preceding tracts will not be less suitable and beneficial to  his  scheme than  his  certainly is to mine  "Let us suppose a settlement" says he  to be formed for  one hundred fa∣milies  composed of five persons each upon an average  Lay out upon a river or creek a squ of yards or a mile for each side  That square will contain acres  Allowance for streets and public uses acres  To half an acre for every house acres  To lots at ½ acres acres  The four sides of the square mea∣sures yards which gives to each  house about yards in front to stoc∣kade and the ground allowed for building will be feet front and about feet deep  An acre of ground will produce at least bushels of Indian corn there∣fore two acres are sufficient to supply five persons at the rate of bushels each person two other acres will be for cows and sheep another for hay or to be sown with red clover the re∣maining half acre may be laid out for a garden  Thus far the author's plan may be applicable to lands even in England especially if laid out in less divisions of  tithings  instead of  hundreds  preserving the same due proportion of land in lots for each family The  ten  fa∣milies with their habitations would form a compact little village under the govern∣ment of a  tithingman  annually elected from among themselves whereby all  would be rendered mutually responsible for each other for the common peace and to make good every damage that might be occasioned by the ill behaviour of any individual among them An estate laid out in small farms with such a  tithing  village in the centre of it for a constant supply of labourers might be made to maintain a much greater number of peo∣ple than land generally does in the ordi∣nary way of farming and would conse∣quently be much more beneficial both to the landlords and to the nation at large Commons and waste forests or chases might thus be laid out and occupied by the labouring poor to the great reduction of parish rates as well as of the price of labour for free and useful labourers would never be wanting if such a regular provision under their own management could be found for their families But the possession of such parishlots should  be limited to those persons who occupy no other land and should be delivered up to the parish or community for the use of other unprovided families as soon as any possessor obtains more land either as a farm or in fee as recommended in a former Tract to prevent  the monopoly of land  and the entire deprivation of the poor from any share in it as at present  The remainder of the author's scheme is suitable only to unoccupied countries like many parts of Africa and America where the people are few and the lands of small value viz "Round the town" says he  are the commons of three miles square containing exclusive of the lots abovementioned acres On three sides of the town five other squares will be laid out of three square miles containing acres each one of which is reserved for wood for the use of the settlement the other four  to be divided into outlots or plan∣tations of about acres each so that in the four squares there will be such plantations for the fa∣milies Another township may be laid out joining this upon the  ame plan and as many more as you please upon the same line without losing any ground  The following is a rough Sketch of the whole  The banks of the river as in ancient times should be deemed  common  or  public  as the river itself under the conservation of the  community  and should be reserved for future improvements as for the ac∣commodation not only of fishermen but also of manufacturers traders and of all industrious strangers and docks or navi∣gable cuts whenever the level of the country will permit should be made from the river as far back at least as the centre between every two townships  The spaces between the squares are left for roads and common communications between the several lots and the roads which divide two distinct townships should be still more spacious for the common use of all the inhabitants the cartage of their produce and other traffic the dri∣ving of cattle c and a spacious road to be formed lengthways throughout the whole settlement ought in forming the  lots to be reserved through the centre of each township the central lots which will thereby be diminished in  size  will find ample compensation in  value  by their situation on the great central road which I have expressed by a dotted line I do not remember whether any roads or spaces for them were expressed in the original plan of the author  I would likewise deviate from the ori∣ginal plan of the author with respect to the situation of the acres of wood∣land for each township which I con∣ceive had better be reserved in one of the most distant squares at an angular situation from each town instead of being in the opposite square according to his proposal for the towns will not only be more healthy by having the uncleared lands more distant from them but also the inhabitants when on watch and ward duty will be better enabled to discover  the approach of any lurking savages or other enemies in time of war  GRANVILLE SHARP  Old Jewry  Aug  TRACT Number V  A farther Declaration of the ancient  po∣pular  or  congregational Right to elect Bishops  intended to illustrate more effectually a Maxim of the Common Law cited in p viz  Ordo Epis∣coporum est Robur Reipublicae  Jenk Cent p  "ORDO EPISCOPORUM EST ROBUR REIPUBLICAE"  Jenk Cent p  IT is an established maxim of the com∣mon law of England that  The or∣der of bishops is the strength  force or hability  "of the commonwealth"  But in order to render this maxim obvious and unquestionable we must necessarily imply and include in the  episcopal  func∣tion that very important branch of it already mentioned viz the presiding as chief  popular  magnistrates in the  congrega∣tional  courts of common law  See second note in p  "Leges Edgari"  c  and we must also suppose the continuance or re∣establishment of the  primitive christian freedom  in episcopal elections that the bishops by real  popular  elections may be truly  popular  magistrates worthy to  be entrusted with the  civil  as well as the  ecclesiastical  INTERESTS  of the commonwealth  Mr Sadler in his  Rights of the Kingdom  speaking of the time of K Henry II says  It seemeth conside∣rable how all historians of that time and dispute do record  THE CHOICE OF BISHOPS  to be in the  PEOPLE  in  PLEBE and in POPULO  as well as in  CLERO  They mention  RADULPH  or∣dained a bishop for the Orcades but rejected by all because not elected by  COMMON ASSENT  of the  PEOPLE PLE∣BIS CLERO  For  cleri  PRINCIPIS it is  every where in the old monks and how the poor bishop wandered up and down as an assistant to other prelates  c  See p and more instances also at p The learned author of a tract printed several years ago as appears by the list of tracts published at the same time but without a date intituled  Lex Parlia∣mentaria  or a Treatise of the Law and Custom of Parliament  c has cited various proofs of the  people's right  to elect bishops  "That for some years"  says he  after this new charter granted in this English parliament  meaning a parliament held at London by K Henry I  the  PEOPLE  were generally  RESTORED  to the right of electing their own magis∣trates and officers civil military and  ECCLESIASTICAL and this  says the learned author  I take to be the  grand foundation of the  MAGNA CHAR∣TA of English liberties ie as it gave relaxation from Norman tyranny and slavery And this may teach us that the rights and liberties of the commons of England are neither so illegally begotten as by rebellion nor of such tender years as some imagine But if any man is not convinced from what I have before produced touching the  origin of English parliaments and the antiquity of the house of commons let him peruse the authors cited in the margin  Dier and See Mirror c sect Bra Flet Lambard's Archaion Sir R At∣kins p c Vide Post c  especially the treatise writ by that learned judge Sir Robert At∣kins on this very subject  Nor was this the first English par∣liament held under this king Mat Paris has given us a brief account  Inst Saxon Chron sub anno p Flor Wig

exauctoration of  bishops  Rights of the kingdom p c  the same assent seems as ne∣cessary and that too in a superior de∣gree  as to their  election  or  confirma∣tion  divers instances of this appear in the historians of those times I shall select some to prove it  then  the custom of England Scotland Wales Ireland France c  Anno Ralph bishop of Ro∣chester  Sax Chr p  was elected archbishop of Canterbury by the king  annuente plebe clero  Eadmer  this was done  in communi consilio apud Windsore  Hoveden  And I find about the same time that another Ralph who had been ordained a bi∣shop in Scotland was rejected by all because not elected with the consent of the people c and notwithstand∣ing his consecration was forced to wander about and officiate as a coad∣jutor to other bishops  About the year  Malmsb  one David was consecrated bishop of Bangor by  the then archbishop of Canterbury but it is expressly said that he had been thereto elected  a principe clero populo Walliae  i e by a Welch par∣liament And in the same reign one Gregory an Irish abbot was elected to the bishopric of Dublin  a rege Hi∣berniae clero populo  an Irish par∣liament So that the commons at this time were a constituent part of the Scottish Welch and Irish parliaments as well as with us in England  And in the year  Vide Sax Chr sub An  I find that famed scholar Gilbertus Universalis to be elected and consecrated bishop of London  annuente clero populo  This seems at a parliament at London  But this right of the commons in electing bishops does more clearly appear in Henry II's time when all historians agree it to be a general cus∣tom  both here and in France and seems founded on divers express canons of the primitive church Insomuch as Me∣zeray in his history asserts that un∣til that time i e the middle of the th century  the voice of the people in electing bishops was esteemed the voice of God  Even the histories published by papal authority bear ample testimony of the people's  right  and the exercise of it in an∣cient times though it has been long usurped by that very authority See  Italia Sacra  the History of the  Italian Bishops  cited in the former tract vol I p in the account of the bishops of  Tarracina  where it is expressly declared that on the death of  Avitus  bishop of  Tarra∣cina  St Valentine was elected bishop by the  CLERGY  and  PEOPLE  of that city  S

 In the account of the archbishops of Florence vol III p of the said work Zenobius about the year is said to have been  elected  not only  by the clergy  but by ALL THE PEOPLE which unanimity was esteemed a  divine call  not lawfully to be refused  Non solum a clero sed etiam ab universo populo so∣lemniter ad  PONTIFICATUS  This expression  "pontificatus"  for  episcopatus  is much more modern than the times to which it is here applied though considered perhaps as a synonymous term by the compiler of this history who of course may be supposed to express himself in the  modern  language of his own times There are many examples of the like gross  misap∣plication  of this word and also of  pontifex  for  episcopus  by ecclesiastical historians but we are not therefore to conceive that they found these words so applied in the  ancient  records from which they compiled their histories For the word  pontifex  did not signify a  christian bishop  the etymology of the word being deducible entirely  from a gross  PAGAN  ceremony  as I have already shewn in p  peculiar to  ROME  itself  and applicable to none but  the pagan augurs of  ROME until the  Roman emperors  of the  Western branch  usurped the title of PONTIFEX MAXI∣MUS for political purposes and whilst they continued in power to maintain it which they did at least to the death of Valentinian III AC if not to the time of  Augustulus  when the Western branch of the Roman empire was entirely abolished by Odoacer in the year no bishop could either have the power or even an  inducement  to assume the title of  pontifex  until the  imperial head  to which it was inseparably annexed became  "as it were wounded to death"  nor until the time was come that this  "deadly wound"  was to be  "healed"  and wo be to that  bishop  who first disgraced his function by that  fatal mark  apicem est  ELECTUS  Nec vero licuit ei reniti vel obsistere  ISTIUS MODI ELEC∣TIONI  quorum ut praefatus sum ita  CONSENSU  et

Silvianus an African was  elected  bishop of Tarracina  a clero et populo  tom I p But the language respecting the appointment of the bishops of Tarracina was totally diffe∣rent in the very next century nay even under their  Saint Gregory  or  Pope Gregory  THE GREAT the papal usurpation on the rights both of  clergy  and  people  was become shamefully notorious for we read of  bishops  taking the charge of the church of Tarracina  ex imperio  MAG∣NI GREGORII  by the command of GREAT GREGORY  GREAT  Gregory  indeed he might well be called for the popes having then lately  See p  revived the  imperial  title of  PONTIFEX MAXI∣MUS  were become suitably  great  and  imperious  in their language so that notwithstanding the  countertitle  of  ser∣vus servorum Dei  which Gregory had hypocritically assumed as a cloak of humility to cover the pride of the for∣mer title yet in his  imperious  language he sufficiently manifested the character of the  "little horn"  foretold by Daniel ch vii in  which  were eyes like the eyes of a man  i e the horn was to be a  bishop  or rather a succession of  bi∣shops  who are properly  seeers  or  over∣seers  viz  very aptly repre∣sented by  "the eyes of a man"  and  a mouth speaking great things  And accordingly we read of  Agnellus bi∣shop of Funda  or Fanda  who  managed the church of Tarracina 'ex imperio' by the command of  GREAT GREGORY  Aguellus Fundanus episcopus Tarracinensem ecclesiam administravit  EX IMPERIO MAGNI GREGORII  c tom I p  And also that  Con∣stantius  bishop of Palermo had charge of the flock of Tarracina 'ex imperio' by the  COMMAND  of the same St Gregory the pontifex  Constantius Panormitanus episcopus curam gessit de grege Tarracinen  EX IMPERIO  ejusdem S Gregorii pon∣tif uti palam fit ex lib    epist    tom I p  Thus the popes be∣gan to elude the  election  of bishops by appointing other bishops to take care of the vacant sees but they afterwards bold∣ly took the  election  even nominally upon themselves which before they had usurped indeed in effect but did not so openly profess and accordingly in the very same page we read of one  Ambrosius  a MONK being ELECTED bishop of  Tarracina  by pope Alexander II in the year  ab Alexandro  II ELECTUS  fuit episcopus an    and also of one  Gregory  another MONK being  elect∣ed  Gregorius  MONACHUS  Casinensis a Paschali  II  pontifice  ELECTUS  c  bishop of  Tarracina  by pope Pas∣chal II  The popes obtained this absolute do∣minion over  episcopal elections  by various arts and wiles and by gradual encroach∣ments craftily made according to the circumstances of the people they intended to deceive from time to time and they always advanced in their demands after the admission of every unjust claim which demonstrates the danger of swerving in any respect from primitive usages The  monkish clergy  in every part of the world in proportion as the false notions of the sanctity of  celibacy  advanced and prevailed were regularly the instruments employed in thus  sapping  the rights of  the clergy and people  But the fathers at the council of Laodicea which was as early as the year of Christ or according to bi∣shop Beveridge See Dr Cave's Hist Eccles p did not proceed so  gra∣dually  in sapping the  rights  of the  people  but boldly excluded them at once from  all interference at  episcopal  elections see canon XII and also from  the appointment of priests  see canon XIII which how∣ever as the learned patriarch of Antioch Balsamon has remarked affords proof that  not only  BISHOPS  were elected in ancient times by  THE MULTITUDES  or people "  but even the  PRIESTS  also  says Balsa∣mon  c That the  people  were allowed a share in the election even of their  priests  as well as of their  bishops  appears also by a quotation which I find in the M S  notitia ecclesiastica  of the learned Dr Man∣gey before cited viz  Dist LXXVI Can  Quicunque exinde jam accessu temporum  PRESBYTERIO  vel

was an established practice in Spain for  the clergy  and  people  of each city or district to elect  priests  appears by the th canon of the fourth council of Toledo  Sed nec ille deinceps  SACERDOS

council But with respect to  episcopal elections  they seem to have affected an imitation though a very delusive one of the ancient mode of electing two or three persons as de∣scribed in a note of a former tract p and they thought themselves obliged still to acknowledge that the people were intitled to some share in the election which however they reduced to as small a proportion as they could venture to do at that time and craftily stated it in a most precarious light to leave room for farther  innovation  viz that  THREE PERSONS  should be nominated by the bishops  i e instead of the  people  as before  out of which three persons the  CLERGY OR CITIZENS  should have power to elect  ONE  "Placuit"  thus like  popes  and  kings  they mani∣fested their  "will and pleasure"  against

too generally the notorious instru∣ments of  "the man of sin"  The word VEL is artfully inserted instead of the copulative ET between the words CLERICI and CIVES that the  acknowledged right  of the

the suppression of the  people  's share in  the election  The like  monkish  craft appears also in the third canon of the third council of  Orleans  De comprovincialibus vero ordinandis cum consensu metropoliti cleri  VEL  civium  c Ibid p  AD But though this deceitful mode of innovation could pass at  Arles  and  Orleans  yet it was too gross to be admitted in the capital of France at a still  later period  for even so late as the third council of Paris A D we find the right of the  clergy and people  to elect bishops expressly  juxta antiquam consuetudinem  c publicly asserted and

clergy  shall have required by the most ample de∣sire  by the most manifest majority in sentiment  Let not any bishop be brought in by the command of the prince  or king  "nor through any condition" "or  terms    whatsoever against the will of the me∣tropolitan or of the conprovincial bishops But if  by royal appointment  any bishop with too much rashness shall presume to pass through  or attain

presume to receive him contrary to  these  prohibitions let him be severed from all the brethren and remo∣ved from the esteem of all of them  c Which is clearly the penalty of  excommunication  decreed against any bishop that shall presume to acknowledge the authority of any  royal appointment  to the dignity of a bishop and they had it in their power to render such appointments null and void by refusing  the essential  introduction to the office the giving an  episcopal commission  by laying on of hands and previous prayer  But  the grand enemy to  law  and  right  the PAPAL POWER found means at  length to  dispense  with this just Parisian  law  for pope  Zacharias  the same that absolved  Pepin  from his oath of allegiance to king Childeric III thought proper also in the  plenitude of his dispensing power  to  INDULGE  king Pepin that he might  NOMINATE  bishops to be ordained throughout the kingdom of France as any sees should become vacant  See Italia Sacra tom I p

The danger of  regal influence in episco∣pal elections  had been early foreseen and carefully guarded against not only by  the council of Paris  last cited but also by the  primitive church  The peculiar care and caution of the  primitive church  to preserve  episcopal elections  from  undue influence  is worthy to be remarked because it demonstrates the existence and preeminence of the  episcopal order  in the church clearly distinct and superior in office and de∣gree to the  order of presbytery  from the apostolic times and though  all bishops  must certainly be  presbyters  yet the constantreordination of every  presbyter  after being  elected  or nominated to the office of a bishop by the same essen∣tial rites of solemn prayer for the guidance and assistance of the Holy Spirit with the imposition of hands demon∣strates that presbyters though really  pastors  and in some respect  overseers  of distinct  flocks  or congregations of christians yet were not properly  bishops    in the  primitive  ecclesiastical sense until admitted to that dignity by the renewal of their sacred orders with the express  designation  to the  episcopal  function for the  essen∣tial rights  of  ordination  prayer for the Holy Spirit and laying on of hands are the same for all the three de∣grees of the christian ministry differing only in the  de∣signation  to their respective duties of deacons presbyters and bishops  and thereby  the wickedness of this  lawless  pope and his INDULGENCE to K Pepin is render∣ed the more conspicuous The learned bishop Beveridge gives a decided opinion that the th canon of the ancient codex which he calls  codex canonum primitivae ecclesiae  was necessarily ordained  lest any person by money or  MEANS OF SECULAR POWERS  should be promoted but  ONLY  by the free election of  THE CLERGY  and  PEOPLE  Ne quis pecuniâ aut  SECULARIUM POTESTATUM  ope  sed LIBERATANTUM CLERI POPULIQUE ELEC∣TIONE  promoveatur  See his "Codex Canonum Ecclesiae primitivae vindicatus" c p  But no com∣ment can be more clear and decided than the canon itself in guarding against the  interference of princes  viz  if any  BISHOP  having availed himself  of the power or influence  of  WORLDLY PRINCES  shall through them have ob∣tained authority over a church let him he deposed and separated  or excom∣municated  and also all those that com∣municate  or have fellowship  with him  See bishop Beve∣ridge's  "Codex Canonum Primitivae Ecclesiae"  can p  The council of Paris before cited seems to have copied the spirit of this law Thus the most jealous repub∣licans may be convinced that  episcopacy  has  no necessary  connection with  monarchy  but on the contrary is an institution which  ought to be entirely independent  of it  independent  I mean with respect only to NOMINATION or  election  to the dignity so that  royal mandates  and  letters missive  with the  "congé d'elire"  are by no means founded in  right  but are only  modern encroachments  promoted by  popes  and  monks  when they  were unable to mo∣nopolize  the power of  election  to  themselves  for they would rather throw the  nomina∣tion  into the power and  will  of  arbitrary  princes  than see it  lawfully  exercised by the  clergy  and  people  provided their  par∣tial  favour towards  royalty  were admitted as an "INDULGENCE" from their own  plenitude of power  But though king Pepin was base enough to avail himself of the presumptuous and wicked encroachment of pope Zachary on the people's rights yet his son and grandson were more ho∣nourable than their ancestor and instead of basely accepting this most unjust  papal indulgence  on the contrary asserted the  popular right  to elect bishops in the plain∣est and most unequivocal terms and no∣bly and  disinterestedly  rescued it from the usurpations of the  monkish  clergy which had almost universally prevailed for some time before For the emperor CHARLES THE GREAT most nobly ordained  That bishops should be chosen according to the statutes of the canons by the  ELECTION OF THE CLERGY AND PEOPLE  of the  proper diocese  See Capitularia Caroli Magni lib i  Ut epis∣copi  PER ELECTIONEM CLERI  et  POPULI  secundum statuta canonum de propria diocesi elegantur  And the emperor Lewis  the Good  or  Ludovicus Pius  also asserted the same just  rights  of the  clergy  and  people  Let a bishop be elected by the  CLERGY  and  PEOPLE  of the proper diocess without respect of persons or bribes  but  on account of worthi∣ness of life and gift of wisdom  See  Capitularia Ludovici Pii  which are annexed to the canons of the third council of Aix  Concilium Aquisgranense III A D sub Ludovico Pio ce∣lebratum  cap  Episcopus per  CLERUM  et  PO∣PULUM  eligatur de propria dioecesi absque personarum et munerum acceptione ob vitae meritum et sapientiae do∣num  Howel's Synop Can p  These excellent laws would probably have continued in force much longer than they did if they had been observed with the primitive precautions stated in a for∣mer note viz to elect  two  and after∣wards to decide by  lot  because this an∣cient mode of  exercising the joint elective  rights of  CLERGY  and  PEOPLE is so safe and perfectly unexceptionable that it must have obviated the plausible objection that was usually alleged by popes and monks against POPULAR elections ie the danger of exciting  party animosities  and  tumults  The monks however were not able entirely to set aside these excellent constitutions of Charles and Lewis for several years afterwards and the influence of them seems to have ex∣tended even to  Rome  itself for the bishops at a  lateran council  not less than years afterwards viz A D asserted the  rights of the clergy and people  and even the pope himself Nicolas I con∣curred the more willingly perhaps be∣cause the general purpose of the canons then made was to curb the extravagance of a  rival  metropolitan John VIII arch∣bishop of  Ravenna  whose province was intituled  Aemilia  The very first canon was to restrain the archbishop  from conse∣crating  bishops throughout  the province of  Aemilia except after  THE ELECTION OF THE CLERGY AND PEOPLE a testi∣mony highly to the point in question and the more especially if we consider that it proceeded from a quarter the seat of usurpation that had long been inimi∣cal to all  popular  rights See  caput pri∣mum    Episcopos per  AEMILIAM  non consacres nisi post electionem  CLERI  et  POPULI  Italia Sacra tom p This canon would have done more ho∣nour however to the  lateran council  and pope Nicolas had it extended to episco∣pal elections in  general  instead of being  confined  to the province of  Aemilia  The archbishop of Aemilia had probably en∣croached on the elective rights of the  clergy and people  of his province but this alone could not have been considered at  Rome  as a  crime  it having been the re∣gular practice of the popes themselves  had he not at the same time professed  independence of the Roman see  and the Pontif though probably like his prece∣cessors a natural enemy to the  elective rights  of the  clergy and people  was con∣tent it seems to acknowledge them whilst the reformation tended to reduce the pretensions of his  rival  and indeed he gained a complete conquest over him by means of this lateran council wherein he reduced him to the pitiful dilemma of accepting a continuance of his preferment on the most humiliating terms of submis∣sion to the  Roman See  which was by no means due from a  metropolitan  bishop and compelled him basely and dishonestly to yield up the just rights and  independence  of his province to the encroaching juris∣diction of the papal power  A very few years afterwards about the year pope John VIII or rather  John IX as he is stiled by  Platina  Many  ancient  writers of good repute represent pope  John  VIII to have been a  woman  and some of them add that he was even an  English woman  It is  therefore  to avoid the throwing any farther un∣necessary blame on our reputed  countrywoman  that I say  rather  John IX  than John VIII because the times I speak of were about the quarter part of a century later than the period usually assigned for the  infallible  dominion of our extraordinary  English  pope Of late indeed it has been a sort of  fashion  amongst  protestant  writers as well as  papists  to deem the story of  pope Joan  a mere  fable  thus much however is certain that if it be a  fable  it was not invented by the  protestants  Accounts of it were written by undoubted catholics some  centuries  be∣fore the reformation and these accounts were  even printed  several years before either Luther or Calvin were preachers  Martin  the author quoted for it by  Platina  was a dominican frier  apostolic  chaplain un∣der pope Nicolas III AD and was afterwards a  popish arch∣bishop  in Poland so that from his situation and rank in life it was neither probable that he should want the best information on that sub∣ject which the times he lived in could afford nor that he should adopt such a story had it not been  current  and  generally admitted  at that time  Platina  who quotes him was employed by pope  Sixtus  IV to write the  History of the Popes  and would not surely have quoted this story from  Martin  if he had thought that it might  with propriety  have been absolutely rejected but on the contrary he is so far from making  Martin  alone answerable for the story that he declares it to be the  common report  "  Haec quae dixi  VULGO FERUNTUR"  commonly report∣ed  it seems by  several authors  whom he is pleased however to deem  uncertain  and  obscure "incertis tamen et obscuris auctoribus"  though he had no right to include  Martin  in this vague censure In the very next sentence however he entirely exculpates him as well as his  obscure authors  from the invention of the story by adding that it was  "what almost all affirm" "quod fere omnes affirmant"  see p a This was  printed  at Venice in    Werneris Rollwinck  who in his  "Fasciculus Temporum"  relates the story without expressing the least doubt about the truth of it was a  Carthusian frier  so that he was as little likely as the two former writers to publish this ac∣count through any pique or prejudice against the  papacy Rollwink  has also added that this  John  was the sixth pope who had the name of sanctity without the thing itself and like others was also smitten of God and not placed in the catalogue of pontiffs  Et hic  sextus  vide∣tur fuisse PAPA qui nomen sanctitatis sine re habuit usque huc et similiter sicut alii a Deo plagatus fuit nec ponitur in catalogo Pon∣tificum  See p b This was  printed  in the year In the chronicle of  Sigebert  the story is related as a  current report  i e  fama    "Fama est hunc Joannem foeminam fuisse"  c This author was a  Benedictine monk  about the year and his work was printed by  H Stephens  the  French king's printer  at Paris in so that there is no reason to suspect either the author or the printer of  partia∣lity  against  popery  Of all these different authors except the  first Martin  I have the printed copies before me of the several dates abovementioned Many other authors I find quoted for the story who were also professed  Roman Catholics  as  Marianus Scotus  a  monk  at Mentz who wrote a  chronicle  about the year the chronicle also of  Pe∣trarque  printed at  Florence  in That of  Antoninus  who was  archbishop of Florence  and died A D that of the  abbe Trithemius  and also the commentaries of  Raphael Volatteranus  dedicated to pope  Julius  II c c c and all  before  the  protestant  times So that the  fable  if it is one must not be attributed to  protestants  but we cannot say so much for the  opposition  that has been made to it for the  protestants  may certainly be said to have  innocently  occasioned it though they cannot justly be answerable for the futility of the farfetched arguments and pretences that have been raked together by learned  Jesuits  for that pur∣pose The advancement of the  reformation  rendered it necessary indeed for the honour of the  eternal city  to patch up and plaster over the  incu∣rable  sores and blains of the papal pretenders to  infallibility  but after all the pains that have been taken the reasons or rather excuses alleged for the first introduction of the  perforated chair  the famous  "sedes stercoraria"  see Platina p are so frivolous and unsatisfac∣tory that they seem much more improbable and  fabulous  than the plain  fable  itself as they presume to call it which  most naturally  accounts for the absurdity  openly availed himself of this newly ac∣quired  extension of power by  ostentati∣ously  submitting the  archbishops of Ravenna  together with the archbishops also of  Milan  against all probability of  right  or  seemliness  to the jurisdiction of the  bishops  of  Pavia  or more properly  Papia  a very  ominous  appellation derived as even my popish author admits see  Italia Sacra  tom I p from the  Latin  inter∣jection PAPE  O wonderful  or  O strange  The Pontif however thought himself obliged to admit at the same time the  elective rights  of the  clergy and people of  PAVIA probably the better to secure from examination and opposition the usurped authority of the  "privilegium"  as he called it whereby he exalted the  bishops of Papia  above their brethren the independent metropolitans of  Ravenna  and  Milan  This  "privilegium"  would not have been mentioned by me had it not contained an express testimony  "Decernimus ut si humana  contradictione  " pro∣bably for  conditione    tuae sedis episcopus ex hoc mundo migraverit  de proprio clero quem idoneum prae caeteris  CLERUS  et

popular right  of election And the author of  Italia Sacra  speaking farther of this Pope  John  and Bishop  John  re∣lates that the latter obtained these and also  other privileges  in a council held at  Papia  by Pope  John  but these it seems were the chief as being the only  privi∣leges  he has particularized  "In quo"  concilio  ab eodem  PONTIFICE ALIA  obtinuit  PRIVILIGIA  ac praecipue ut  POPULO CLEROQUE  Papiensi  SUUM EPISCOPUM ELIGENDI JUS ESSET  eidemque concessit ut quoties Mediolanen∣sem  ac  Ravennatensem archiepiscopos cum suis suffraganeis ad synodum vocaret accederent  c Italia Sacra tom I p  About seven or eight years before this time viz A D or the th  council of Constantinople intituled by the popish or Latin party the eighth gene∣ral council wickedly declared against the  unalienable popular right  of electing Bi∣shops and formed a canon expressly against it Pope John therefore on the lastmentioned occasion might have be∣sides his partiality to the bishop of  Papia  a still farther inducement for reestablish∣ing the  clergy  and  people  of  Papia  in their just  right of  election viz to demonstrate the  plenitude of his power in dispensing with laws  because whatever tends to aggran∣dize the papal jurisdiction may sometimes afford an ample reason even for a  Pontif  to do  right  The same reason probably may be assigned for the continuance of  popular  elections even at Rome itself long after the said decree of the general council against them for pope Adrian III in the year was  "so bold"    "tanti animi fuit"  says Platina in  behalf of this just  right  that he announ∣ced it to the senate and people viz that  in creating a pope the authority of the emperor should not be waited for and that the suffrages of  THE CLERGY  and  PEOPLE  should be free  Adrianus III patria Romanus patre Benedicto  tanti animi fuit  ut init o pontificatus sui statim ad senatum populumque retu∣lerit anno Domini DCCCXCV ne in creando pontifice imperatoris auctoritas expectaretur utque  libera  essent et  cleri  et  p  puli  suffraga quod quidem inst tu um a Nicolao primo tenta um potiusquam in∣choatum diximus  But ma  k the leading cause of Adrian's  bold∣ness  I  lectum credo hac opportunitate Adrianum quòd Karolus Imperator ab Italia cum exer  itu discedeus in Normannos rebellantes moyerat  And he adds that  this institution was rather attempt∣ed than begun by pope Nicolas  I  But this however was not the case for even he himself relates in his accounts of pope Nicolas on the preceding page not only that the  clergy  and  people  did really elect without waiting for the  im∣perial will  but also that letters were afterwards  received from the emperor Lewis  II  in which he highly commended the Romans that they had knowingly and  wholly created their own chief pontif without waiting for the wish of others who perhaps in that business through the want of personal knowledge might have had less judgement  Supervenere a Ludovico imperatore literae quibus Romanos adniodum laudat quod summum pontisicem scientè et integrè creas∣sent non expectato aliorum voto qui fortè ea in re ob ignora∣tionem personarum minus judicii habuissen  It is manifest therefore that Platina was inclined to attribute the merit of pro∣moting free  popular elections  at Rome rather to the  Pope  than to the  Emperor  to whom it was more strictly due even according to his own evidence for  Popes  and  Monks  could not endure a concurrent right of the  people  in episcopal elections except when it might seem to  aggrandize  the holy see as a  peculiar privilege  or un∣less it were admitted in any particular place by  papal  favour and  indulgence  as at  Papia  for the like purpose of  aggrandize∣ment  But in all other cases they were the regular professed enemies to  popular  right  so that to  their  influence and not to the influence of imperial or royal pow∣er is the wicked  decree against free elections  to be attributed And this was carried it seems on the stale pretence of proba∣ble  tumults  and  the confusion that a mul∣titude of electors might occasion  just as the present  tumults  in Westminster afford to the enemies of the English con∣stitution an exulting argument against the ancient  right  of  frequent elections  who instead of being willing to correct the  abuse  of an institution would rather de∣stroy the profitable  use  of it but such perverse reasoners are either  deplorably ignorant  or else  shamefully wicked  for the same argument holds equally good for  robbing  the people of their  pecuniary  pro∣perty because many of them make a very improper use of what little money they have to spare and indeed the rob∣bery would be much  less dishonest  and  sin∣ful  in the latter case than in the former for though both are  rights  of the people and cannot therefore be infringed with∣out  iniquity  and  injustice  which are hate∣ful in the sight of God yet the  right  of  election  whether it be to  civil  or  ecclesias∣tical  offices is  inestimable  and above price so that no plea of  expedience  or even of  "necessity"  can justify the  gross dishonesty  of infringing it They might as well persuade us to cut off our legs lest we should strain our ancles in walking or absolutely to prohibit  all  men from riding on horseback because  some  men have had dangerous falls and others have acci∣dentally lost their lives by it yet such arguments are not more  grossly absurd  than this pretence of  tumults  as a reason for robbing the people of their  election rights  and yet  this absurdity  prevailed in the th council of Constantinople though the popular  right  was expressly allowed  On a longtemps conservé  aux laics  LE DROIT  d'assister aux élec∣tions  says  Herycourt  in his  Analyse  p  et d'y donner leur suffrage La  CONFUSION QUE POUVOIT CAUSER LA MULTITUDE DES ELECTEURS  engagea à n'y admettre plus que la clergé On en fit un decret exprès dans la  VIII  concile général  For so he stiles but very improperly the th council held at Constantinople in  Ce changement n'a point empêché que l'on ne fut obligé de demander le consentement des  SOVE∣REIGNS  And this obligation to ask the  consent of sovereigns monkish prelates  were content to endure notwithstand∣ing that the interference of all  secular Princes  in episcopal elections is strictly forbid by the canons of the primitive church see p provided they could but prevail on the  Monarchs  to join them in effecting an entire exclusion of the  people's right to elect  However neither the  mon∣kish  nor the  monarchical  influence could entirely overcome the  popular right  in England until many years afterwards which I have already proved by several incontestible examples But it was far otherwise in  France  for even in the same century ninth the  Kings of France  instead of maintaining equal justice be∣tween  the clergy and people  like their pre∣decessors Charles the Great and Lewis I and II now claimed to  themselves the  NO∣MINATION of BISHOPS of which I find a memorandum in the learned Dr Mangey's  Notitia Ecclesiastica  before cited viz  "It seems"  says he  that in the ninth century the kings of France claimed the  NOMINATION  of Bishops  And if this  monarchical  usurpation of the most essen∣tial  popular right  in the Christian church was not actually promoted by the Roman  "mystery of iniquity"  for I have already given an instance of Pope  Saint Zacha∣riah  's  plenary  indulgence  to such  dishonesty  see p it had at leastafterwards the  express consent  of the  Roman  court provi∣ded that the  papal  share of the unlawful plunder might be admitted with it and accordingly we read of  THE CON∣CORDATE  as formerly between the murderer  Herod  and  Pontius Pilate  now also  between Pope Leo  X  and K Francis The Pope  COLLATES  upon the King's  NOMINATION  This memo∣randum I found in Dr Mangey's  Notitia Ecclesiastica  for which he cites  Herycourt  lib c  Le  CONCORDAT  fait entre Leon  X  et François  I  a transferé à nos Rois tout le  DROIT  des électeurs  The  concordate  made between Leo X and K Francis I hath transferred to our Kings all the right of the electors  This indiscriminate writer could not per∣ceive or if he did he must be charged with a much worse fault than  indiscrimi∣nation    that the DROIT  of the electors  could not be  transferred  by those who had  no right  in it and consequently that the kings of France do not exercise a DROIT but a TORT as long as their unjust usurpation of the DROIT conti∣nues and I wish I could speak more fa∣vourably of the  usurpation of our elective rights  in England  The rights of  episcopal  elections as well as the nature of the  episcopal office  itself have indeed been subjects of much controversy in the Christian church and the several dissentients that have hither∣to published their opinions might long ago have approached much nearer to an agreement in the happy medium of truth had they been endued with sufficient  im∣partiality  but this alas has been too much wanting on every side of the con∣troversy The  episcopalians  on the one hand though they have in general  well maintained and proved the nature and efficacy of the  episcopal  function and the exercise of it  in every age of the church  clearly distinct from the office of mere  presbyters  demonstrating that though every  bishop  must be  a presbyter  yet that every  presbyter  most certainly  was not a bishop  nevertheless on the point of  epis∣copal elections  they have either been to∣tally silent like the learned Archbishop Usher  Archbishop Usher however in another useful work not professedly on the subject of Episcopacy has nevertheless in occasional notes produced several instances of  Bishops elected by the  PEOPLE  as well as by the clergy  See Veterum Epistolarum Hibernicarum Sylloge viz the th d th th and st epis∣tles with the Archbishop's  remarks  upon them toge∣ther with his remarks on the th epistle all which  remarks  will be found at the end of the book under the title of  "Epistolarum Recensio"  The examples relate to the  free elections by the clergy and people  of the Bishops of  Dublin  and  Waterford  between the years of Christ and which Bishops as well as the Bishops of  Limerick  received in those times their epis∣copal ordination or consecration from the Archbishops of Canterbury and  freely  acknowledged the jurisdic∣tion of that see The inhabitants of the said Irish cities were colonies of  Normans  who invaded Ireland and took possession of those parts under the command of  Rollo  and his two brothers according to an account cited by Archbishop Usher ibid p which was probably  before  his conquest and settlement in a part of France about A D Dublin however and the greatest part of Ireland was afterwards viz about A D conquered by our AngloSaxon King Edgar as ap∣pears by his charter of that year  "De Oswaldes law"  ib p a circumstance not much noticed by histo∣rians as the Archbishop remarks on the said charter or diploma p  "in quo"  says he  quod omnes historiae tacent  MAXIMAM PARTEM HIBERNIAE CUM SUA NOBILISSIMA CIVITATE DUBLINIA ANGLORUM REGNO SUBJUGATAM A SE FUISSE  confirmat  But though our  AngloSaxon  government soon afterwards lost their dominion in  Ireland  with respect to temporal matters yet these  Norman  colonies in  Ireland  long after∣wards freely acknowledged and endeavoured of their own accord to maintain an ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the archbishops of Canterbury over their  own elected  Bishops by regularly applying to Archbishop Lan∣franck and some of his successors archbishops of Can∣terbury to consecrate their elected Bishops And the  elergy  and  people  of  Dublin  in one of these epistles viz to Radulph Archbishop of Canterbury A D say "  We have always willingly submitted  OURS" i e our Bishops  to the  GOVERNMENT OF YOUR PREDE∣CESSORS  from which we remember that  OURS  received ecclesiastical dignity  Antecessorum enim vestrorum magisterio semper  NOSTROS LIBEN∣TER SUBDIMUS  a quo recordamur nostros accepisse dignitatem eccle∣siasticam  p  But whether the submission of these Irish sees to the province of Canterbury commen∣ced only after the establishment of the  Normans in England  is not certain though it is most probable that the cus∣tom might have been founded on a more ancient con∣nection of those cities with the province of Canterbury under the AngloSaxon conquerors especially as the burgesses and clergy of Dublin in their letter dated A D last cited assert that  their voluntary submission  to that see had  "been preserved a long time"  multo tempore  for they warn  Sciatis vos reverâ quod Episcopi  Hiberniae  maximum zelum erga nos habent et maximè ille

that see which for  ALONG TIME  "multo tempore"  we have preserved to you  Epist p The th epis∣tle An is from  the  clergy and people of the church of Dublin  to Lanfranck Metropolitan of Canterbury in the address of which they tender their  "debitam subjectionem"  See p  Venerando sanctae Cantuariensis ecclesiae metropo∣litano Lanfranco clerus et populus ecclesiae Dublinensis debitam

therefore  WE  say the clergy and people  HAVE ELECTED A PRESBYTER  by name  PATRICK  to us very sufficiently known noble in birth and morals c whom we request as soon as may be to be ordained our bishop  c  The d epistle AC p is from Anselm Archbishop of Canterbury to the Bishops of Ireland informing them that on the death of his predecessor Archbishop Lanfranc the King the Bishops and the great men of the kingdom had dragged him violently to the episcopal chair  the clergy and people  calling out for the same purpose    Defuncto beatae memoriae praedecessore meo  Lanfranco

pertrahunt clero et populo acclamantibus in id ipsum ut nec unus cui quod gerebatur displiceret visus fuerit interesse  p  This seems to have been  an election by the parliament  like many other examples about that time viz by  the King the Bishops the Lords of the kingdom the clergy and people  and therefore though it affords evidence of the  popular right  to elect yet it is not a proper example for imitation in episcopal elections which should be made only by  the clergy and people of each particular diocese  according to the ancient canons and practice of the primitive church  The th epistle A C p is from  the clergy and people of the town of Waterford with King Murchertag and Bishop Donald  to Archbishop Anselm wherein they say    Nos et Rex noster  Murchertachus  et Episcopus  Domnaldus  et  Dermeth  Dux noster frater Regis ELEGIMUS HUNC PRESBYTE∣RUM  Malchum Walchelini  Wintoniensis episcopi monachum nobis sufficientissimè cognitum c c Hunc nobis petimus a vestr

and Dermeth our Duke brother of the King have  ELECTED THIS PRESBYTER MALCHUS  the monk of Walchelin Bishop of Winchester  to us very sufficiently known c  him we request to be ordained our Bishop  by your paternity c  The st epistle in p is from Henry I K of England to Radulph Archbishop of Canterbury as follows  Henricus Rex Angliae Radulpho Cantuariensi Archiepiscopo salutem  Mandavit mini Rex  Hiberniae  per breve suum et Burgenses  Dub∣linae  quod elegerunt hunc  Gregorium  in episcopum et eum tibi mit∣tunt consecrandum Unde tibi mando ut petitioni eorum satisfa∣ciens ejus consecrationem sine dilatione expleas Teste Ranulpho Cancellario apud Windelsor  p    the King of  IRELAND  hath informed me by his brief and the Burgesses of  DUBLIN  that  THEY HAVE ELECTED  this  GREGORY  who was probably the bearer of the King's letter as well as of the former N  o  from the  burgesses and clergy  of Dublin  and send him to thee to be consecrated wherefore I command thee that satisfying their petition thou mayest complete his consecration without delay  At Windsor witness Ranulph Chancellor  Thus it appears that the conquest of  Ireland  by King Edgar did not affect the just liberties of the  church of Ireland  for the  Norman  colonies therein still enjoyed the uninfluenced  election  of their own Bishops and though they acknowledged the jurisdiction of the pro∣vince of Canterbury in  ecclesiastical matters  even when they were become  independent  and separated from us under a King of their own yet that submission was per∣fectly  voluntary  and  free  and was continued for no other reason than because they had originally received  episco∣pal ordination  from the Archbishops of that see Never∣theless they declared themselves at liberty to receive consecration from the Archbishop of Armagh and other Irish Bishops who earnestly desired to confer it on them in case the prelates of Canterbury should be negligent in their superintendency And the Bishops also of the  native Irish  and their flocks were equally free and inde∣pendent in  ecclesiastical matters  having preserved a due succession of the sacred order of episcopacy from the early times of their  first  conversion  before  the time of the  first Patrick  down to the barbarous times of our K Henry II who invaded their island under the delusive sanction of a  papal commission  to compel the submission of the  church of Ireland  to the jurisdiction and doctrines of the  church of Rome  and to pay an annual tribute to the pope of one penny for every house and all this on the delusive pretence of  instructing  the Irish  reforming their manners  c Henry obtained his first commission for these pur∣poses from pope Adrian IV A D which Arch∣bishop Usher has inserted in his said collection of an∣cient epistles p And he informs us in p from  Trivettus  that Henry treated with his parliament at Winchester concerning the  conquest of Ireland  but be∣cause it did not please his mother the empress that ex∣pedition was postponed to another time The empress probably was shocked with the  injustice  of the proposal notwithstanding the  popish dispensation  for it  Afterwards however in the year Pope Alex∣ander III revived the former wicked and presumptuous grant of Adrian for invading and usurping the  temporal rights  as well as spiritual jurisdiction of the  clergy and people of Ireland  whereby "  the dominion of the Irish kingdom was  INDULGED  to  " Henry and in the pleni∣tude of his  unlimited  and  unlawful  power this  man of sin  presumptuously ratified and confirmed  "  Concessionem ejusdem  " i e Adriani Papae  super Hibernici regni dominio vobitindulto  falvâ beato  Petro  et sacrosanctae ROMANAE  ecclesiae sicut in  ANGLIA  sic et in  HIBERNIA  de singul  s domibus  annuâ unius denarii pensione ratam habemus et confirmamus  c p  the  iniquity  The  usurping  Popes may therefore most justly be deemed the most cruel enemies and destroyers of the  temporal  as well as  ecclesiastical  RIGHTS  of the people of Ireland  yet so great was the darkness occasioned by the future  papal  jurisdiction therein that the  mist  is not yet entirely dispelled so that multitudes of wellmeaning  Irish  people cannot yet perceive that the cor∣rupted and usurping  church of Rome  ought to be ranked amongst the most inveterate and dangerous enemies of the  church of Ireland  in his excellent little tract  De  episcoporum et metropolitanorum origine  and Dr  Cave  in his learned and laborious  Dissertation concerning the government of the  ANCIENT CHURCH  by Bi∣shops  Metropolitans and Patriarchs  or else have expressed a great degree of  prejudice against all ancient testimonies which tend to justify any claim of  popular  or  congregational right  in the choice of  Bi∣shops  and zealously opposing thereto a  multitude of  precedents  wherein the  im∣perial  or  royal  power has been exercised  in the  appointment  of  Bishops  and like the  indiscriminate  Herecourt before quo∣ted  not discerning  that the latter are  pre∣cedents  only of  usurpation  not of  right  Those of the opposite party the  presbyte∣rians  who attribute the dignity and func∣tion  of  Bishops  to their  Presbyters  The learned author of  An Enquiry into the Consti∣tution Discipline Unity and Worship of the Primitive Church  c a work commonly attributed to the late lordchancellor  King  has laboured hard to level the  primitive Bishops  to the degree of mere  Rectors of pa∣rishes  and to elevate the  Presbyters  to the rank of  Bishops  though there are clear proofs of the superiority of  Bishops  and of the ordinary residence in each place but of  one  Bishop with  several  Presbyters and Deacons at the same time included even in some of the citations which he has collected to favour a contrary doctrine His opi∣nion seems to have been built principally on a peculiar explanation of the word  ordination  "That  ordination  " says he  that I shall speak of is this the grant of a peculiar commission and power which remains inde∣lible in the person to whom it is committed and can never be obliterated or rased out except the person himself cause it by his heresie apostacy or most ex∣tremely gross and scandalous impiety  Thus far there is no need to oppose his sense of  ordination  but he adds "Now this sort of  ordination  " says he  was conferred  only upon Deacons and Presbyters  or  on Dea∣cons and Bishops Presbyters and Bishops being here to be considered as all one  as Ministers of the church univer∣sal  p This appears to be the keystone whereby the whole fabric of the doctrine throughout his work is suspended and held up and consequently the whole building must fall by the removal of it Very happily for the determination of the dispute he has pro∣duced within a few pages after the place from whence this quotation was taken some clear and unquestionable examples of the  ordination  of some persons to the degree of  Presbyters  who really  were not Bishops  and never had  episcopal  dignity in the ordinary ecclesiastical sense of the word  episcopal  so that they could not consistently with truth  "be considered as all one"  with  Bishops  according to this learned writer's hypothesis  He cites in p the express testimony of Eusebius for the  ordination  of ORIGEN to be a  Presbyter  that the Bishops of Caesarea and Jerusalem  ordained  or laid hands upon  "him into the presbytery"  i e to make  him a Presbyter    Euseb lib c p Here then is a clear proof of the ordination of a person to be a  Presbyter  by the hands of  Bishops  and yet no man that has any regard to the testimony and truth of ecclesiastical history will presume to say that  Origen  was a  Bishop  though he was unquestionably or∣dained to be a  Presbyter  and consequently it cannot be true that the ordination of "  Presbyters  and  Bishops  " is  "to be considered as all one"  By another quotation in p from Eusebius this learned writer proves also that  Novatian was ordained a  PRESBYTER  by imposition of hands  ie the hands of a BISHOP as Eusebius declares  Cornel apud Euseb lib cap p  And that this is a clear example of  the ordination of a mere Presbyter  manifestly distinct from  ordination to the episcopal dignity  is demonstrated by the same chapter of Eusebius which relates the wicked fraud of  this same Presbyter  Novatian at a time when he was already a  Presbyter  to obtain a  farther ordination  for the  episcopal  dignity by inveigling three simple country Bishops to  ordain him a Bishop  by the imposition of their hands And therefore though  all Bishops  are certainly  Presby∣ters  yet these examples cited by the learned writer clearly demonstrate that  all Presbyters are  NOT  Bishops  and consequently that their  ordination  is NOT  to be considered as all one  The rite of ordination i e  the laying on of hands by the Bishops after solemn prayer of the whole congregation for the assistance of the Holy Spirit  is indeed  "all one"  as well in the ordaining of  Dea∣cons  as in the ordination of  Presbyters  and in the con∣secration of Bishops differing only in the  designation  to these respective offices of the Christian Ministry as I have already remarked in p n but then this single circumstance of  designation  is sufficiently effectual to occasion an  essential  difference in the three degrees of holy  orders  for what are  orders  but  designations  or de∣clarations of the office conferred or function to be dis∣charged insomuch that a person who hath been duly ordained by the  same solemn rite  with a  designation  to the office of a  Deacon  may not assume the office of a  Presbyter  without a  repetition of that rite  and an express  order  or  designation  to the office and duty of a  Presbyter  and a  Presbyter  who has  twice  received holy  orders  by the same solemn rite cannot lawfully assume the dignity and office of a Bishop until he hath been  first  duly  elected to be a Bishop  and  secondly  which is the  most essential  circumstance by which  episcopal  authority is really con∣ferred until he have been once more  ordered  or  ordain∣ed  notwithstanding his two former  orders  as a Deacon and as a  Presbyter  and that with a repetition of the  same solemn rite  the laying on of hands with previous pray∣er but differing in this that there is always an express  order  or  designation  to the  episcopal  function previous to the prayers and laying on of hands The example of  Novatian  cited above shews that the  reordination  of  Presbyters  in order to obtain the degree and function of a  Bishop  was  deemed necessary  even early in the third century Other examples which I have quoted in pages n concerning the  reordination  of  Pres∣byters  that had been  elected  to be  Bishops  prove that the same opinion as well as  practice  was preserved in the middle centuries of Christianity and the  present  uni∣versal practice of the episcopal church in giving  priests orders  always previous to  episcopal  consecration is too well known and established to need the citation of par∣ticular examples for illustration  The learned Chancellor if he was the writer of the said book hath also  supposed  that the petition of a  candidate for holy orders  was to the whole Presbytery because  says he p  a Bishop alone could not give those holy orders as is most evident  says he  from  Cyprian  who assures us that  all clerical ordinations were performed by the common counsel of the whole Presbytery  and therefore  says he  when upon a  most urgent and necessary occasion  he had been forced to ordain one but a  Lector  without the advice and consent of his  Presbytery  which one would be apt to think was no great usurpation he takes great pains to justify and excuse himself for so doing  But all this supposition falls at once to the ground as soon as the authority which he has cited for it Cy∣prian's th Epist is more carefully examined for it really contains no such doctrine and doth  not at all  re∣late to  "clerical ordinations"  which he has too hastily supposed Cyprian had  not  given  "holy orders"  the subject of the learned writer's argument to the persons for whose appointment he thought it necessary to apolo∣gize in that epistle for they were still  "sub clero"  as he expressly declares  under the degree of clergy  so that the apology could not be for having  ordained  any one in the  ecclesiastical  sense of that word but only for  having  MADE or appointed one man a  Lector  or  Reader  in the church and for  having  MADE another man a  Subdeacon  FECISSE  me autem sciatis  LECTOREM  Saturum  et HYPODIACONUM  Optatum confessorem  These were mere local functions in the church at the disposal not only of the  Presbyters  and Deacons but also of the  laity  or whole congregation who have a  right  to elect to such offices in many places even to this day so that an apology was really necessary in this case for having acted  without their consent  but no apo∣logy would have been due had the case been a  mere or∣dination  or  conferring of holy orders  The example is entirely foreign to the question of  presbyters  having a right to  confer holy orders  and as a proof that it is so be pleased to remark that the apology is addressed  jointly to the Presbyters and Deacons  and cannot there∣fore prove the right of the  former  to confer  holy orders  without admitting also the  latter  to the same degree of authority an idea which the learned writer never intended to promote  Cyprian  has been as much misunderstood by some former advocates for the  Presbyterian  pretensions to the  right of ordaining  who  to prove that  ordination by Bishops without the assistance of  PRESBYTERS  was always forbidden and opposed  tell us  says Dr Ham∣mond  of  Aurelius  's being ordained by  Cyprian  and his  collegues  ep and then assure us from ep that by his  collegues  he means his  Presbyters  where yet there is no other proof of it but the using of these  words  in the  inscription  of the  epistie  Cypri∣anus  cum collegis  et  ego et collegae  Cyprian  with his collegues  and  I and my collegues  This  says Dr Hammond  is a great but discernible  fallacy  put upon the  reader  as will soon appear if we but observe that the d epistle where he tells of Aure∣lius was written by  Cyprian  to his  Presbyters  and so THEY ARE the persons whom he advertiseth what  he and his collegues  had done and so sure WERE NOT those  collegues  that did it  with  him Or se∣condly if for the understanding  Cyprian  's notion of  collegues  ep we shall but look forward to the next epistle for that will fully discover it being this  Cyprianus et caeteri collegae qui in concilio affuerunt numero  LXVI where  Cyprian  's  colleagues  are evidently the Bishops that were in  council  with him And so St  Austin  in his th epistle to St  Hierome  men∣tioning this very  epistle  saith  Cyprianus cum Coepis∣copis suis Cyprian with his fellow Bishops  an irre∣fragable evidence that these his  collegues  were  Bishops  The like  says he  might be also observed of the  testimony  out of  Firmilian  which they there subjoin of the  Seniores  and  Praepositi  that have  power  of  ordain∣ing  by whom say they the  presbyters as well as the Bishops are understood  but again it is clear by the express words of the  epistle  that by them are meant  the Bishops  in their  annual council necessario apud nos fit ut per  SINGULOS ANNOS SENIORES  et  PRAEPOSITI  in unum conveniamus  c  I should not have made so long a quotation from Dr  Hammond  had not the learned  Chancellor  or author of the tract just before cited once more held forth these very testimonies to justify  ordination by Presbyters  though they had long before been so amply confuted by Dr Hammond  "It is a sad mistake" says the rev Mr Tho Sa  mon in his  Historical Collections relating to the Originals  c  of the Inhabitants of Great Britain  p  of those who have a prejudice against episcopacy that it is an invention of the  Popish  times and that our  Re∣formers  so modelled the constitutions of our church as they might be most agreeable to the humour of the  Romanists  But certainly the history of Britain may convince any man of the contrary The  Popish  times did not begin at the council of  Arles  yet there we had our Bishops The fathers of the council of  Nice  had spent their days under the severest persecutions of the heathen and were just entered upon the morn∣ing of the christian empire and shall we think that popery was then prevalent Our church is now set∣tled as it was at that time Not only Bishops all over  Britain  so far as it was christian but very near the same number of Bishops The three chief bishop∣rics were settled at three most distant and proper places to have jurisdiction over the rest  London York  and  Caerleon  There were in all cities and accord∣ingly bishoprics as the number is given us both by  Gildas  and  Bede  and if we have now two less yet so much of Britain as lies between  Berwick  and  Edinburgh  now belonging to  Scotland  may well be allowed for the making of two At the council of  Nice  the jurisdiction of their metropolitans was settled and the union of all the Bishops of the Pro∣vince provided for Such was the order and harmony of the whole clergy that though the diocese was so large that it could not be particularly known and taught by the superior officers of the church yet every one acting in his place and being accountable to those above him there was no defect either in the doctrine or discipline of those primitive times  Certainly there is demonstration for episcopacy in that there  were not only Bishops before popery  but when the popish missionaries set up in the world  the old Bishops were the very men that made the opposi∣tion against them  Nothing can be more undoubted in history than that the  British  Bishops met  Austin  and his companions at the famous oak upon the banks of  Severn  and there utterly broke with them pe∣remptorily refusing subjection to the pope of Rome It is also as certain that  Colman  bishop of  Lindis∣farn  and his northern clergy who had their origi∣nal Christianity from  Britain  maintained the grand dispute at  Streanshale  against  Agelbert Wilfrid  and the rest of the Romanists that they retired and for∣sook their preferments rather than they would submit to the impositions of  Rome  The laying aside their ancient observations and receiving the papal tonsure were looked upon by them both as innovations and badges of servitude to a foreign power and therefore rejected by them as they are by us at this day We must maintain like them the customs of the church which have been from the beginning there  always was a commemoration of Christ and his apostles at certain times  which we also observe without any he or she saints of the  Roman  make There always was a sub∣mission to the authority of the church in matters of decency and order which is all that we require without the least subjection to the church of  Rome  We yield no deference we utterly renounce her au∣thority over us And to suppose that our reformers either wanted judgement to distinguish between the ancient customs of the church and the later inventions of popery or that they wanted integrity to the true christian religion whose works and martyrdom bear witness in their favour is such a pretence as cannot support itself under a sincere consideration  We should be fond of episcopacy if we did but review that opposition which the pope always made against it  if we did but observe  how he could never compass his ends but by the destruction of its power  He raised up the se∣veral orders of monks that those who were employed in religion might depend  upon him and not upon their Bishops  he exempted the monasteries from the juris∣diction of the diocesans that all those rich planta∣tions might heartily espouse the tyranny and supersti∣tion of  Rome  He did all he could to transform the bishops into monks and prevailed so far that every archbishop of  Canterbury  thought it necessary to put on that habit which made his  episcopacy subservient to another sort of government  He found that a diocesan Bishop with his clergy in a cathedral church was such a bulwark to the national establishment that he could not dilate his empire he therefore by his interest with King  Egbert  got the great  Oswald  law to pass  by which the Presbyters were cast out and monks put in∣to their places  How can episcopacy be a popish in∣vention when it has been all along  the great business of the pope to overthrow it  We must ever own great honour and reverence due to  Columba  who planted his monastery or university in the isle of  Hye  upon the coasts of  Scotland  which was a seminary for all the christian ministers of the north but that the custom or education of this place should be against episcopacy is impossible since they  not only had a Bishop in that little island  but  Adam∣nanus  one of the successors of  Columba  gives us an account of the great deference they always paid to that order Bishop  Aidan  came from thence con∣verted the  Northumbrians  had his episcopal see in the island of  Lindisfarn  which was afterwards re∣moved to  Durham  After he was dead Bishop  Finan  was ordained by the  Scots  and succeeded him by  Finan  was  Diuma  the first Bishop of  Litchfield  or∣dained whose successors were also from  Scotland  and of the episcopal order We meet also  Colman  from  Scotland  that Bishop of the  Northumbrians  who was ejected for the protestant cause If  Columba  himself had such an affection of the monastic life that he would not stir from  Hye  and was of so great au∣thority that it was thought fit the Bishops of the north should be accountable to him and his successors to whom so much was committed of the royal power this can be no argument against episcopacy itself since it is declared at the same time that such a submission of Bishops to an abbot was a perverting that order which was established in the church Those who read only the account of  Scotland  in the last century may perhaps have an opinion that there was an ancient of Presbyterian government there but all authentic histories testify that they had the same constitution of ecclesiastical orders which were in the rest of  Britain  and all other christian nations  and also more particularly the Independents  who together with them contend for the  congregational  or  popular right  to ELECT  are apt to lay  too much stress  perhaps on this external circumstance of FREE ELEC∣TION  for they generally consider it as  essential  to the sacerdotal function where∣as  in fact it is only  expedient  and  desira∣ble  but not absolutely necessary being  indeed the most prudent mode of  intro∣duction  to the constituting  rite of conse∣cration  but no part of the  rite  itself which consists only of  solemn prayer  with the  laying on of hands  in which latter the  laity  can have no pretence to interfere  We may safely acknowledge without injury to our  electionrights  that the Bishops of the primitive church who succeeded immediately after the apostles were not generally  elected  by the  people  but were appointed ei∣ther by the apostles themselves as I have before re∣marked or by  apostolic men  for which see the evidence of Tertullian p  Ceterum si

con∣sanguinitate doctrinae  c p Paris edit    But this  primitive rite  of the church the  laying on of hands  is publicly rejected by  many of the Independent and Socinian ministers  The ceremony of  THE IM∣POSITION OF HANDS  says one of them for instance in reporting the cha∣racter of an eminent Socinian Preacher  he also refused to submit to because he considered it as void of any just meaning where no extraordinary gifts are or can be imparted  This opinion of  the imposition of hands  must have been too hastily taken up because it is certain∣ly erroneous The fact is that this ce∣remony like all other  outward rites  that were instituted by Christ or his Apostles  may  or  may not  be efficacious according to the  inward disposition  or sincerity of the person to whom the  outward rite  is administered  Neither the administration of  baptism  nor the participation of the  Lord's Supper  can impart any good effect on those who receive them  unworthily  without since∣rity  without regard to the  internal  and  spiritual  GOD  is a  SPIRIT  and they that worship him must worship him  IN SPIRIT  and in truth  John iv  There is nothing in this text which can fairly be con∣strued  against  the use of external ceremonies either of the  laying on of hands  or of the  sacramental institutions of Christ  though it is certainly applicable to enforce the necessity of a  sincere and spiritual devotion  in the use of them as also in our daily  prayers  but those men who not only despise these institutions of Christ and his primitive church but even neglect for the most part in their public meetings Christ's positive injunctions TO PRAY "  Ask and it shall be given to you  c Mat vii and neglect more especially TO PRAY for the HOLY SPIRIT which is so clearly promised  to them that ask  Luke xi through a groundless persuasion that they do obtain that heavenly gift by other means those men I fear are under  a very dan∣gerous delusion of a contrary spirit  for it would be unrea∣sonable to admit their pretensions to  spiritual worship  in the sense of that text of John viz  in spirit and in truth  whilst they prefer their own  novel  way of worship to that  true  worship which was so clearly com∣manded by Christ and practised by the primitive Christians and the universal church  signification but merely to  please men by an  outward  conformity to the ceremonies for some worldly advan∣tage  or favour as many do by way of  test  to such men  "no extraordinary gifts  are or can be imparted"  by these  out∣ward  rites which on the contrary ra∣ther increase their condemnation For though very worthy ministers who offi∣ciate therein or administer these  outward  rites may be deceived by the outward de∣portment of the persons to be baptized or communicating yet God's  Holy Spirit  is not to be mocked as we learn by the sad example of Ananias and Saphira whose dissimulation was punished by an imme∣diate stroke from God to impress the in∣fant church with a due sense of the Al∣mighty Power and the necessity of  since∣rity  in all things pertaining to God's Ser∣vice Such extraordinary  outward  mani∣festations of God's Spirit are not now to  be expected it is sufficient that they con∣tinued until authentic historical accounts of our holy religion were dispersed in writing throughout the greatest part of the known world and the canon of the sacred Scriptures completed in which ample accounts of them are related so that we may say of the New Testament as our Lord said of the Old Testament adding to  the necessity of believing Moses and the Prophets  the  necessary belief  also of the New Testament that the men who believe not these additional testimo∣nies of Christ's Disciples and witnesses  would not believe even if one should rise from the dead  Thus it appears that the extraordinary  outward  manifestations of God's Spirit in working miracles are no longer  necessary  for the edification of the church but we must not therefore say that  no extraordinary gifts are or can be imparted  For miracles are not the only test of the real inspiration of  God's  Holy Spirit  but  love good works and hold∣ing fast the faith which was once delivered to the Saints  These are the  fruits  by which we are to judge of the tree and without these even miracles are to be suspected of delusion and are to be es∣teemed rather as the  lying wonders of Satan  than as the works of God The power of  working miracles  therefore is not such an  "extraordinary gift"  as we have any right to look for or to expect under the present dispensation of the  christian religion  and yet  the gift of God's spirit  which every true Chris∣tian has a  right  to expect according to the unquestionable promises of Christ is certainly  "an extraordinary gift"  and is as certainly  "imparted"  to all that  duly ask it  in the meritorious name of our Redeemer if we may confide in the truth of the holy Scriptures It is always  "an extraordinary gift"  though  im∣parted  according to  the ordinary  dis∣pensation of our religion because it sup∣ports and endows pious and worthy men on many occasions far beyond their  ordi∣nary  or natural abilities and strength It is I say a real addition to the  ordinary  na∣ture of man and therefore always  an  extraordinary gift  being nothing less than a real participation  of the  DIVINE NATURE  of which we may if we will be  partakers    through the  exceeding great and precious promises  of that divine person  that hath called us to glory and virtue  See Pet i  If men are thus assured that this  ex∣traordinary gift  may be obtained by  asking  according to Christ's directions they surely cannot doubt of its being  im∣parted  when they  ask it  in a more particular manner on great and solemn occasions as at the  baptism  of adults or  the  confirmation  of persons that have been baptized in their infancy and at the sa∣cramental  commemoration of Christ's death  according to our Lord's own insti∣tution these  outward rites  cannot  impart the extraordinary gift  but the goodness and truth of God are absolutely pledged if I may use such an expression to ful∣fil the  exceeding great and precious pro∣mises  in favour of  prayer  for that  ex∣traordinary gift  and such  prayer  having this the object doth always make a part of those  solemn rites  whereby they are most certainly rendered efficacious if  sincerity  be not wanting in those persons to whom they are administered  And it is exactly the same thing with respect to  "the imposition of hands"  ei∣ther in the consecration of Bishops or in the ordination of Priests and of Deacons because that  ancient rite  of Christ's church is always performed with  solemn prayer  in  Christ's name for the  Holy Spirit  to guide and assist the persons consecrated or or∣dained and the prayers of the congre∣gation are also desired on their behalf and therefore if the persons  elected  to be consecrated for the office and dignity of Bishops and the candidates for Priests or Deacons orders are really  sincere  them∣selves in their  prayers  and undertakings there is no doubt but  the laying on of hands  thus accompanied with suita∣ble prayer and devotion is truly effica∣cious and doth  impart the extraordi∣nary gift  abovementioned For the action of  "laying on hands"  hath nothing in it indecent immoral or contrary to God's laws such as might be supposed to hinder the good effect of Christ's absolute  promises to them that ask  but on the contrary is authenticated and sanctified by  apostolic usage  declared in canonical  Scripture as well as by the constant sub∣sequent practice of all the primitive churches of Christ and ought not there∣fore to be laid aside on the groundless pretence that  no extraordinary gifts are or can be imparted  GRANVILLE SHARP  Old Jewry  Oct  A very worthy member of parliament having lately read as much of this tract as was then printed was pleased to pro∣pose the following queries in answer to which the following letter was sent to him by the author viz  How could we divide this and other great towns into tithings  Would not streets be a better division in cities Parishes and streets instead of tithings and hundreds  ANSWER  Dear SIR  THE ancient mode of dividing great cities was by  wards  each of which was governed by an  alderman  the  ealdor∣man  of the AngloSaxons an officer of great authority in the  common law  being a JUSTICIARY and having all the powers of our modern  justices of the peace  and what is more was always elected by the  housekeepers  or  deciners  of the  ward over  which he presides This antient mode of division by no means interferes with the lesser divisions of  tithings  and  hundreds  so far from it that the government of the  wards  is not complete without them The Lord Mayor's precept to the alder∣men orders them to this day to hold courts of  frankpledge  See Bohun's Privilegia Londini p under the head of  Wardmote Courts  and the Lord Mayor's annual Precept to hold them which latter amongst other things contains the following articleNo  And for that of late there is more resort to the city of per∣sons evil affected in religion and otherwise than in former times hath been you shall diligently inquire if any man be received to dwell or abide within your Ward that is not  put under  FRANKPLEDGE  as he ought to be by the custom of the city  c  which were not without the regular divisions of  tithings  to give them effect The wards are  local  divisions of various magnitude and have been formed as you suggest some by  streets  some by the intersection of  brooks  now covered over but those various di∣mensions  of space required a regular  nu∣merical  division of the  housekeepers  in or∣der to ascertain the due proportion of the representatives in the  commoncouncil  of the city  The averagerate of  commoncouncil∣men  to the  housekeepers  or  deciners  is at present about one to And as the city was in antient times more popu∣lous and the houses smaller for each fa∣mily when men were restrained by law from building in the environs of the city it is probable that the true proportion of  housekeepers  to elect  one commoncouncil∣man  should be so that the com∣mon council has formerly been an assem∣bly of  hundreders  or  high constables  As the gates of the city have been removed so as to leave this most important place entirely exposed to the fatal consequences of any sudden riot the attacks of any  hardened banditti and especially in cases of any alarms by fire to the most dange∣rous confluence of multitudes of unknown people many of whom plunder the dis∣tressed and others hinder the necessary means of assistance it is highly expedient that some means of defence should be de∣vised I have been told that in the great cities of Japan the streets are barricadoed and shut up with  palisade  gates every night and that the people are actually divided into  tithings  and  hundreds  I have much to say on this subject and if you are not going out of town immediately I will do myself the honour to wait on you and communicate my thoughts  I remain with great esteem Dear SIR Your most humble Servant GRANVILLE SHARP  Old Jewry  Aug  * * * * Esq
