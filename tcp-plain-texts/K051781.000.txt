a dark Lanthorn  LOPEZ  PAST three o'clock soh a notable hour for one of my regular disposition to be strolling like a bravo thro' the streets of Seville well of all services to serve a young lover is the hardestnot that I am an enemy to love but my love and my master's differ strangelyDon Ferdinand is much too gallant to eat drink or sleepnow my love gives me an appetitethen I am fond of dreaming of my mistress and I love dearly to toast herThis cannot be done without good sleep and good liquor hence my partiality to a feather bed and a bottlewhat a pity now that I have not further time for reflections but my master expects thee honest Lopez to secure his retreat from  Donna Clara's window as I guess    Music without    hey sure I heard music so so who have we here Oh Don Antonio my master's friend come from the masquerade to serenade my young mistress Donna Louisa I suppose soh we shall have the old gentleman up presentlylest he should miss his son I had best lose no time in getting to my post    Exit  Enter  ANTONIO  with Masks and Music  ANTONIOSONG  Soft sym  Tell me my lute can thy soft strain  So gently speak thy master's pain  So softly sing so humbly sigh  That tho' my sleeping love shall know  Who singswho sighs below  Her rosy slumbers shall not fly  Thus may some vision whisper more  Than ever I dare speak before  st Mask  Antonio your mistress will never wake while you sing so dolefully love like a cradled infant is lull'd by a sad melody  Antonio  I do not wish to disturb her rest  st Mask  The reason is because you know she does not regard you enough to appear if you waked her  Antonio  Then I'll convince you  SINGS  The breath of morn bids hence the night  Unveil those beauteous eyes my fair  Nor till the dawn of love is there  I feel no day I own no light  LOUISA replies from a Window  Waking I heard thy numbers chide  Waking the dawn did bless my sight  'Tis Phoebus sure that woos I cry'd  Who speaks in song who moves in light  Don JEROM from a Window  What vagabonds are these I hear  Fidling fluting rhyming ranting  Piping scraping whining canting  Fly scurvy minstrels fly  TRIO  Louisa  Nay pray thee father why so rough  Ant  An humble lover I  Jer  How durst you daughter lend an ear  To such deceitful stuff  Quick from the window fly  Louisa  Adieu Antonio  Ant  Musi you go  Louisa  We soon perhaps may meet again  Ant  For tho' hard fortune is our foe  The god of love will fight for us  Jer  Reach me the blunderbuss  Ant Lou  The god of love who knows our pai    Jer  Hence or these slugs are thro' your brain  Exeunt severally  SCENE II  A  PIAZZA  Enter  FERDINAND  and  LOPEZ  Lopez  Truly sir I think that a little sleep once in a week or so  Ferd  Peace fool don't mention sleep to me  Lopez  No no sir I don't mention your lowbred vulgar sound sleep but I can't help thinking that a  gentle slumber or half an hour's dozing if it were only for the novelty of the thing  Ferd  Peace booby I say O Clara dear cruel disturber of my rest  Lopez  And of mine too  Ferd  S'death to trifle with me at such a juncture as thisnow to stand on punctilioslove me I don't believe she ever did  Lopez  Nor I either  Ferd  Or is it that her sex never know their desires for an hour together  Lopez  Ah they know them oftner than they'll own them  Ferd  Is there in the world so inconstant a creature as Clara  Lopez  I could name one  Ferd  Yes the tame fool who submits to her caprice  Lopez  I thought he cou'dn't miss it  Ferd  Is she not capricious teizing tyrannical obstinate perverse absurd ay a wilderness of faults and follies her looks are scorn and her very smiless'death I wish I hadn't mentioned her smiles for she does smile such beaming loveliness such fascinating brightnessO death and madness I shall die if I lose her  Lopez  O those damn'd smiles have undone all  AIRFERDINAND  Could I ber faults remember  Forgetting ev'ry charm  Soon would impartial reason  The tyrant love disarm  But when enraged I number  Each failing of her mind  Love still suggests each beauty  And seeswhile reason's blind  Lopez  Here comes Don Antonio sir  Ferd  Well go you homeI shall be there presently  Lopez  Ah those curst smiles    Exit  Enter  ANTONIO  Ferd  Antonio Lopez tells me he left you chaunting before our doorwas my father wak'd  Ant  Yes yes he has a singular affection for music so I left him roaring at his barr'd window like the print of Bajazet in the cage And what brings you out so early  Ferd  I believe I told you that to morrow was the day fix'd by Don Pedro and Clara's unnatural stepmother for her to enter a convent in order that her brat might possess her fortune made desperate by this I procur'd a key to the door and birb'd Clara's maid to leave it unbolted at two this morning I entered unperceived and stole to her chamberI found her waking and weeping  Ant  Happy Ferdinand  Ferd  'Sdeath hear the conclusionI was rated as the most confident ruffian for daring to approach her room at that hour of night  Ant  Ay ay this was at first  Ferd  No such thing she would not hear a word from me but threatened to raise her mother if I did not instantly leave her  Ant  Well but at last  Ferd  At last why I was forced to leave the house as he came in  Ant  And did you do nothing to offend her  Ferd  Nothing as I hope to be savedI believe I might snatch a dozen or two of kisses  Ant  Was that all well I think I never heard of such assurance  Ferd  Zounds I tell you I behaved with the utmost respect  Ant  O lord I don't mean you but in herbut hark'y' Ferdinand did you leave your key with them  Ferd  Yes the maid who saw me out took it from the door  Ant  Then my life for it her mistress elopes after you  Ferd  Ay to bless my rival perhapsI am in a humour to suspect every bodyyou lov'd her once and thought her an angel as I do now  Ant  Yes I loved her till I found she wou'dn't love me and then I discovered that she hadn't a good feature in her face  AIR  I ne'er could any lustre see  In eyes that would not look on me  I ne'er saw nectar on a lip  But where my own did hope to sip  Has the maid who seeks my heart  Cheeks of rose untouch'd by art  I will own the colour true  When yielding blushes aid their hue  Is her hand so soft and pure  I must press it to be sure  Nor can I be certain then  'Till it grateful press again  Must I with attentive eye  Watch her heaving bosom sigh  I will do so when I see  That heaving bosom sigh for me  Besides Ferdinand you have full security in my love for your sister help me there and I can never disturb you with Clara  Ferd  As far as I can consistently with the honour of our family you know I will but there must be no eloping  Ant  And yet now you would carry off Clara  Ferd  Ay that's a different case we never mean that others should act to our sisters and wives as we do  to othersBut tomorrow Clara is to be forc'd into a convent  Ant  Well and am not I so unfortunately circumstanc'd Tomorrow your father forces Louisa to marry Isaac the Portuguezebut come with me and we'll devise something I warrant  Ferd  I must go home  Ant  Well adieu  Ferd  But Antonio if you did not love my sister you have too much honour and friendship to supplant me with Clara  AIRANTONIO  Friendship is the bond of reason  But if beauty disapprove  Heaven dissolves all other treason  In the heart that's true to love  The faith which to my friend I swore  As a civil oath I view  But to the charms which I adore  'Tis religion to be true  Exit Antonio  Ferd  There is always a levity in Antonio's manner of replying to me on this subject that is very alarming'Sdeath if Clara should love him after all  AIR  Tho' cause for suspicion appears  Yet proofs of her love too are strong  I'm a wretch if I'm right in my fears  And unworthy of bliss if I'm wrong  What heartbreaking torments from jealousy flow  Ah none but the jealous the jealous can know  When blest with the smiles of my fair  I know not how much I adore  Those smiles let another but share  And I wonder I priz'd them no more  Then whence can I hope a relief from my woe  When the falser she seems still the fonder I grow  Exit  SCENE  A room in Don  JEROME  's house  Enter  LOUISA  and  DUENNA  Louisa  But my dear Margaret my charming Duenna do you think we shall succeed  Duenna  I tell you again I have no doubt on't but it must be instantly put to the trialEvery thing is prepared in your room and for the rest we must trust to fortune  Louisa  My father's oath was never to see me till I had consented to  Duenna  I was thus I overheard him say to his friend Don Guzman  "I will demand of her tomorrow once for all whether she will consent to marry Isaac MendozaIf she hesitates I will make a solemn oath never to see or speak to her till she returns to her duty"  these were his words  Louisa  And on his known obstinate adherence to what he has once said you have form'd this plan for my escapeBut have you secured my maid in our interest  Duenna  She is a party in the wholebut remember if we succeed you resign all right and title in little Isaac the Jew over to me  Louisa  That I do with all my soul get him if you can and I shall wish you joy most heartily He is twenty times as rich as my poor Antonio  AIR  Thou cans't not boast of fortune's store  My love vhile me they wealthy call  But I was glad to find thee poor  For with my heart I'd give thee all  And then the grateful youth shall own  I lov'd him for himself alone  But when his worth my hand shall gain  No word or look of mine shall shew  That I the smallest thought retain  Of what my bounty did bestow  Yet still his grateful heart shall own  I lov'd him for himself alone  Duenna  I hear Don Jerome comingQuick give me the last letter I brought you from Antonioyou know that is to be the ground of my dismissionI must slip out to seal it up as undelivered    Exit  Enter Don  JEROME  and  FERDINAND  Jerome  What I suppose you have been serenading too Eh disturbing some peaceable neighbourhood with villainous catgut and lascivious piping out on't you set your sister here a vile examplebut I come to tell you madam that I'll suffer no more of these midnight incantations these amorous orgies that steal the senses in the hearing as they say Egyptian embalmers serve mummies extracting the brain thro' the ears however there's an end of your frolicsIsaac Mendoza will be here presently and tomorrow you shall marry him  Louisa  Never while I have life  Ferd  Indeed sir I wonder how you can think of such a man for a soninlaw  Jerome  Sir you are very kind to favour me with your sentimentsand pray what is your objection to him  Ferd  He is a Portugueze in the first place  Jerome  No such thing boy he has forsworn his country  Louisa  He is a Jew  Jerome  Another mistake he has been a Christian these six weeks  Ferd  Ay he has left his old religion for an estate and has not had time to get a new one  Louisa  But stands like a dead wall between church and synagogue or like the blank leaves between the Old and New Testament  Jerome  Any thing more  Ferd  But the most remarkable part of his character is his passion for deceit and tricks of cunning  Louisa  Tho' at the same time the fool predominates so much over the knave that I am told he is generally the dupe of his own art  Ferd  True like an unskilful gunner he usually misses his aim and is hurt by the recoil of his own piece  Jerome  Any thing more  Louisa  To sum up all he has the worst fault a husband can havehe's not my choice  Jerome  But you are his and choice on one side is sufficienttwo lovers should never meet in marriagebe you sour as you please he is sweettemper'd and for your good fruit there's nothing like ingrafting on a crab  Louisa  I detest him as a lover and shall ten times more as a husband  Jerome  I don't know thatmarriage generally makes a great changebut to cut the matter short will you have him or not  Louisa  There is nothing else I could disobey you in  Jerome  Do you value your father's peace  Louisa  So much that I will not fasten on him the regret of making an only daughter wretched  Jerome  Very well ma'am then mark menever more will I see or converse with you till you return to your dutyno replythis and your chamber shall be  your apartments I never will stir out without leaving you under lock and key and when I'm at home no creature can approach you but thro' my librarywe'll try who can be most obstinateout of my sightThere remain till you know your duty    Pushes her out  Ferd  Surely sir my sister's inclinations should be consulted in a matter of this kind and some regard paid to Don Antonio being my particular friend  Jerome  That doubtless is a very great recommendationI certainly have not paid sufficient respect to it  Ferd  There is not a man living I would sooner chuse for a brotherinlaw  Jerome  Very possible and if you happen to have e'er a sister who is not at the same time a daughter of mine I'm sure I shall have no objection to the relationshipbut at present if you please we'll drop the subject  Ferd  Nay sir 'tis only my regard for my sister makes me speak  Jerome  Then pray sir in future let your regard for your father make you hold your tongue  Ferd  I have done sirI shall only add a wish that you would reflect what at our age you would have felt had you been crost in your affection for the mother of her you are so severe to  Jerome  Why I must confess I had a great affection for your mother's ducats but that was all boyI married her for her fortune and she took me in obedience to her father and a very happy couple we werewe never expected any love from one another and so we were never disappointedIf we grumbled a little now and then it was soon over for we were never fond enough to quarrel and when the good woman died why whyI had as lieve she had lived and I wish every widower in Seville could say the sameI shall now go and get the key of this dressing roomSo good son if you have any lecture in  support of disobedience to give your sister it must be brief so make the best of your time d'ye hear    Exit Jerome  Ferd  I fear indeed my friend Antonio has little to hope forhowever Louisa has firmness and my father's anger will probably only increase her affectionIn our intercourse with the world it is natural for us to dislike those who are innocently the cause of our distress but in the heart's attachment a woman never likes a man with ardour till she has suffered for his sake  Noise  Soh what bustle is here between my father and the Duenna tooI'll e'en get out of the way    Exit  Enter Don  JEROME  with a letter putting in the  DUENNA  Jerome  I'm astonished I'm thunder struck here's treachery and conspiracy with a vengeance you Antonio's creature and chief manager of this plot for my daughter's eloping you that I placed here as a scarecrow  Duenna  What  Jerome  A scarecrowTo prove a decoyduckwhat have you to say for yourself  Duenna  Well sir since you have forced that letter from me and discovered my real sentiments I scorn to renounce 'emI am Antonio's friend and it was my intention that your daughter should have serv'd you as all such old tyrannical sots should be serv'dI delight in the tender passions and would befriend all under their influence  Jerome  The tender passions yes they would become those impenetrable featureswhy thou deceitful hag I plac'd thee as a guard to the rich blossoms of my daughter's beautyI thought that dragon's front of thine would cry aloof to the sons of gallantrysteel traps and spring guns seem'd writ in every wrinkle of itbut you shall quit my house this instantthe tender passions indeed go thou wanton sybil thou amorous woman of Endor go  Duenna  You base scurrilous oldbut I won't demean myself by naming what you areyes savage I'll leave your den but I suppose you don't mean to detain my apparelI may have my things I presume  Jerome  I took you mistress with your wardrobe onwhat have you pilfer'd heh  Duenna  Sir I must take leave of my mistress she has valuables of mine besides my cardinal and veil are in her room  Jerome  Your veil forsooth what do you dread being gazed at or are you afraid of your complexion well go take your leave and get your veil and cardinal soh you quit the house within these five minutesIninquick    Exit Duenna  Here was a precious plot of mischief these are the comforts daughters bring us  AIR  If a daughter you have she's the plague of your life  No peace shall you know tho' you've buried your wife  At twenty she mocks at the duty you taught her  O what a plague is an obstinate daughter  Sighing and whining  Dying and pining  O what a plague is an obstinate daughter  When scarce in their teens they have wit to perplex us  With letters and lovers for ever they vex us  While each still rejects the fair suitor you've brought her  O what a plague is an obstinate daughter  Wrangling and jangling  Flouting and pouting  O what a plague is an obstinate daughter  Enter  LOUISA  dress'd as the  DUENNA  with Cardinal and Veil and seeming to cry  Jerome  This way mistress this waywhat I warrant a tender partingsoh tears of turpentine  down those deal cheeksAye you may well hide your headyes whine till your heart breaks but I'll not hear one word of excuseso you are right to be dumb this waythis way    Exeunt  Enter  DUENNA  Duenna  So speed you well sagacious Don Jerome O rare effects of passion and obstinacynow shall I try whether I can't play the fine lady as well as my mistress and if I succeed I may be a fine lady for the rest of my lifeI'll lose no time to equip myself    Exit  SCENE IV  The Court before  DON JEROME's  house  Enter  DON JEROME  and  LOUISA  Jerome  Come mistress there is your wayThe world lies before you so troop thou antiquated Eve thou original sinhold yonder is some fellow skulking perhaps it is Antoniogo to him d'ye hear and tell him to make you amends and as he has got you turn'd away tell him I say it is but just he shou'd take you himself go    Exit Louisa  Soh I am rid of her thank heaven and now I shall be able to keep my oath and confine my daughter with better security    Exit  SCENE V  The  PIAZZA  Enter  CLARA  and her Maid  Maid  But where madam is it you intend to go  Clara  Any where to avoid the selfish violence of my motherinlaw and Ferdinand's insolent importunity  Maid  Indeed ma'am since we have profited by  Don Ferdinand's key in making our escape I think we had best find him if it were only to thank him  Clara  Nohe has offended me exceedingly    Retire  Enter  LOUISA  Louisa  So I have succeeded in being turn'd out of doorsbut how shall I find Antonio I dare not enquire for him for fear of being discovered I would send to my friend Clara but that I doubt her prudery wou'd condemn me  Maid  Then suppose ma'am you were to try if your friend Donna Louisa would not receive you  Clara  No her notions of filial duty are so severe she would certainly betray me  Louisa  Clara is of a cold temper and would this step of mine highly forward  Clara  Louisa's respect for her father is so great she would not credit the unkindness of mine    Louisa turns and sees Clara and Maid  Louisa  Ha who are those sure one is Claraif it be I'll trust herClara    Advances  Clara  Louisa and in Masquerade too  Louisa  You will be more surprized when I tell you that I have run away from my father  Clara  Surprized indeed and I should certainly chide you most horridly only that I have just run away from mine  Louisa  My dear Clara    Embrace  Clara  Dear sister truant and whither are you going  Louisa  To find the man I love to be sureAnd I presume you wou'd have no aversion to meet with my brother  Clara  Indeed I shouldhe has behaved so ill to me I don't believe I shall ever forgive him  AIRCLARA  When sable night each drooping plant restoring  Wept o'er the flowers her breath did cheer  As some sad widow o'er her babe deploring  Wakes its beauty with a tear  When all did sleep whose weary hearts did borrow  One hour from love and care to rest  Lo as I prest my couch in silent sorrow  My lover caught me to his breast  He vowed he came to save me  From those who would enslave me  Then kneeling  Kisses stealing  Endless faith he swore  But soon I  hid him thence  For had his fond pretence  Obtain'd o  e favour then  And he had press d  gain  I fear'd my treacherous heart might grant him more  Louisa  Well for all this I would have sent him to plead his pardon but that I would not yet a while have him know of my flight And where do you hope to find protection  Clara  The lady Abbess of the convent of St Catherine is a relation and kind friend of mineI shall be secure with her and you had best go thither with me  Louisa  No I am determined to find Antonio first and as I live here comes the very man I will employ to seek him for me  Clara  Who is he he's a strange figure  Louisa  Yes that sweet creature is the man whom my father has fixed on for my husband  Clara  And will you speak to him Are you mad  Louisa  He is the fittest man in the world for my purposefor tho' I was to have married him tomorrow he is the only man in Seville who I am sure never saw me in his life  Clara  And how do you know him  Louisa  He arrived but yesterday and he was shewn me from the window as he visited my father  Clara  Well I'll be gone  Louisa  Hold my dear Claraa thought has struck me will you give me leave to borrow your name as I see occasion  Clara  It will but disgrace youbut use it as you pleaseI dare not stay    going    but Louisa if you should see your brother be sure you don't inform him that I have taken refuge with the Dame Prior of the convent of St Catherine on the left hand side of the Piazza which leads to the church of St Anthony  Louisa  Ha ha ha I'll be very particular in my directions where he may not find you    Exeunt Clara and Maid    So my swain yonder has done admiring himself and draws nearer    Retires  Enter  ISAAC  and  CARLOS ISAAC  with a pocket glass  Isaac    Looking in the glass    I tell you friend Carlos I will please myself in the habit of my chin  Clara  But my dear friend how can you think to please a lady with such a face  Isaac  Why what's the matter with the face I think it is a very engaging face and I am sure a lady must have very little taste who could dislike my beard    Sees Louisa    See nowI'll die if here is not a little damsel struck with it already  Louisa  Signor are you disposed to oblige a lady who greatly wants your assistance    Unveils  Isaac

signor  Isaac  Because I'm positively engaged to anotheran't I Carlos  Louisa  Nay but hear me  Isaac  No no what should I hear for It is impossible for me to court you in an honourable way and for any thing else if I were to comply now I suppose you have some ungrateful brother or cousin who would want to cut my throat for my civilityso truly you had best go home again  Louisa  Odious wretch    aside    But good signor it is Antonio d'Ercilla on whose account I have eloped  Isaac  How what it is not with me then that you are in love  Louisa  No indeed it is not  Isaac  Then you are a forward

Donna Clara will you trust yourself awhile to my friend's direction  Lousa  May I rely on you good signor  Carlos  Lady it is impossible I should deceive you  AIR  Had I a heart for falshood fram'd  I ne'er could injure you  For tho' your tongue no promise claim'd  Your charms would make me true  To you no soul shall bear deceit  No stranger offer wrong  But friends in all the ag d you'll meet  And lovers in the young  But when they learn that you have blest  Another with your heart  They'll bid aspiring passions rest  And act a brother's part  Then lady dread not here deceit  Nor fear to suffer wrong  For friends in all the ag'd you'll meet  And lovers in the young  Isaac  I'll conduct the lady to my lodgings Carlos I must haste to Don Jeromeperhaps you know Louisa ma'am She is divinely handsomeisn't she  Louisa  You must excuse me not joining with you  Isaac  Why I have heard it on all hands  Louisa  Her father is uncommonly partial to her but I believe you will find she has rather a matronly air  Isaac  Carlos this is all envyyou pretty girls never speak well of one anotherharky' find out Antonio and I'll saddle him with this scrape I warrant oh 'twas the luckiest thoughtDonna Clara your very obedientCarlos to your post  DUETT  Isaac  My mistress expects me and I must go to her  Or how can I hope for a smile  Louisa  Soon may you return a prosperous wooer  But think what I

to that and she gains a father and a husband at once  Isaac  Gad I shall never be able to deal with her alone nothing keeps me in such awe as perfect beautynow there is something consoling and encouraging in ugliness  SONG  Give Isaac the nymph who no beauty can boast  But health and good humour to make her his toast  If strait I don't mind whether slender or sat  And six feet or fourwell ne'er quarrel for that  Whate'er her complexion I vow I don't care  If brown it is lasting more pleasing if fair  And tho' in her face I no dimples shou'd see  Let her smile and each dell is a dimple to me  Let her locks be the reddest that ever were seen  And her eyes may be e'en any colour but green  Be they light grey or black their lustre and hue  I swear I've no choice only let her have two

light she's as handsome a girl as any in Seville  Isaac  Then by these eyes I think her as plain a woman as ever I beheld  Jerome  By St Iago you must be blind  Isaac  No no 'tis you are partial  Jerome  How have I neither sense nor taste If a fair skin fine eyes teeth of ivory with a lovely bloom and a delicate shapeif these with a heavenly voice and a world of grace are not charms I know not what you call beautiful  Isaac  Good lack with what eyes a father sees As I have life she is the very reverse of all this as for the dimity skin you told me of I swear 'tis a thorough nankeen as ever I saw for her eyes their utmost merit is in not squintingfor her teeth where there is one of ivory its neighbour is pure ebony black and white alternately just like the keys of an harpsicord Then as to her singing and heavenly voiceby this hand she has a shrill crack'd pipe that sounds for all the world like a child's trumpet  Jerome  Why you little Hebrew scoundrel do you mean to insult me out of my house I say  Ferd  Dear sir what's the matter  Jerome  Why this Israelite here has the impudence to say your sister's ugly  Ferd  He must be either blind or insolent  Isaac  So I find they are

ended  Behold him and it dies  Last night your roving brother  Enrag'd I bade depart  And sure his rude presumption  Deserv'd to lose my heart  Yet were he now before me  In spite of injured pride  I fear my eyes wou'd pardon  Before my tongue cou'd chide  With truth the bold deceiver  To me thus oft has said  "  In vain wou'd Clara slight me  "  In vain wou'd she upbraid  "  No scorn those lips discover  "  Where dimples laugh the while  No frowns appear resentful  Where Heaven has stampt a smile  Louisa  I protest Clara I shall begin to think you are seriously resolved to enter on your probation  Clara  And seriously I very much doubt whether the character of a nun wou'd not become me best  Louisa  Why to be sure the character of a nun is a very becoming oneat a masqueradebut no pretty woman in her senses ever thought of taking the veil for above a night  Clara  Yonder I see your Antonio is returnedI shall only interrupt you ah Louisa with what happy eagerness you turn to look for him    Exit  Enter  ANTONIO  Antonio  Well my Louisa any news since I left you  Louisa  NoneThe messenger is not returned from my father  Antonio  Well I confess I do not perceive what we are to expect from him  Louisa  I shall be easier however in having made the trial I do not doubt your sincerity Antonio but there is a chilling air round poverty that often kills affection that was not nurs'd in itIf we would make love our household god we had best secure him a comfortable roof    Enter Maid with a letter  My father's answer I suppose  Antonio  My dearest Louisa you may be assured that it contains nothing but threats and reproaches  Louisa  Let us see however    reads    "Dearest daughter make your lover happy you have my  full consent to marry as your whim has chosen but be sure come home to sup with your affectionate father"  Antonio  You jest Louisa  Louisa    Gives him the Letter    Readread  Antonio  'Tis so by heavens sure there must be some mistake but that's none of our businessnow Louisa you have no excuse for delay  Louisa  Shall we not then return and thank my father  Antonio  But first let the priest put it out of his power to recall his wordI'll fly to procure one  Louisa  Nay if you part with me again perhaps you may lose me  Antonio  Come thenthere is a friar of a neighbouring convent is my friend you have already been diverted by the manners of a nunnerylet us see whether there is less hypocrisy among the holy fathers  Louisa  I'm afraid not Antoniofor in religion as in friendship they who profess most are ever the least sincere    Exeunt  Enter  CLARA  Clara  So yonder they go as happy as a mutual and confess'd affection can make them while I am left in solitude Heigho love may perhaps excuse the rashness of an elopement from one's friend but I am sure nothing but the presence of the man we love can support itHa what do I see Ferdinand as I live how cou'd he gain admissionby potent gold I suppose as Antonio didhow eager and disturbed he seemshe shall not know me as yet    Lets down her veil    Enter  FERDINAND  Ferd  Yes those were certainly theymy infortion was right    going  Clara    Stops him    Pray Signor what is

at his surprize when undeceived When he's thro' the porch I'll follow him and perhaps Louisa shall not singly be a bride  SONG  Adieu thou dreary pile where never dies  The sullen echo of repentant
