 ALL IN THE WRONG  A COMEDY  As it is Acted at the THEATREROYAL in DRURYLANE  By Mr MURPHY  In amore haec omnia insunt vitia injuriae  Suspiciones Inimicitiae Induciae  Bellum pax rursum  TERENCE  LONDON Printed for P VAILLANT facing SouthamptonStreet in the Strand MDCCLXI  Price s d  ADVERTISEMENT  THE first hint of this Comedy was suggested by the  Cocu Imaginaire  of  Moliere  who took the idea of his piece from an Italian writer Though jealousy in all its appearances has been frequently exhibited on the English stage yet it was imagined that a plan which should delineate all the varieties of that passion whether subsisting between lovers or in the matrimonial life and blend them together in one piece would not be unacceptable to the public If therefore there is atonement made for the want of originality of character by the decency of the dialogue the novelty of the fable and the complication of the incidents the author has compassed all that he proposed to himself in the ensuing scenes which with pleasure he finds were the occasion of producing the too long concealed powers of Miss  Haughton  and of shewing in a distinguished light the exquisite acting of Mr  Obrien

married her for loveOh love loveWhat mischief dost thou not occasion in this worldYes Robert I married her for loveWhen first I saw her I was not so much struck with her beauty as with that air of an ingenuous mind that appeared in her countenanceher features did not so much charm me with their symmetry as that expression of sweetness that smile that indicated affability modesty and complianceBut honest Robert I was deceivedI was not a month married when I saw her practising those very smiles at her glassI saw thro' the artifice plainly saw there was nothing natural in her manner but all forced all studied put on with her headdressI was alarmed I resolved to watch her from that moment and I have seen such things  ROB  Upon my word Sir I believe you wrong her and wrong yourselfyou build on groundless surmizesyou make yourself unhappy and my lady too and by being constantly uneasy and never shewing her the least loveyou'll forgive me Siryou sill her mind with strange suspicions

becomeyou will pardon my blunt honestyshe is become downright jealousas jealous as yourself Sir  Sir JOHN  Oh Robert you are little read in the arts of women you little know the intricacies of their conduct the mazes thro' which they walk shifting turning winding running into devious paths but tending all thro' a labyrinth  to the temple of Venusyou cannot see Robert that all her pretences to suspect me of infidelity are merely a counterplot to cover her own loose designs'tis but a gauzecovering tho'it is seen thro' and only serves to shew her guilt the more  ROB  Upon my word Sir John I cannot see  Sir JOHN  No Robert I know you can'ther suspicions of me all make against her they are but female stratagems and yet it is but too true that she still is near my heartOh Robert Robert when I have watched her at a play or elsewherewhen I have counted her oglings and her whisperings her stolen glances and her artful leer with the cunning of her sex she has pretended to be as watchful of meDissembling false deceitful woman  ROB  And yet I dare assure you  Sir JOHN  No more I am not to be deceived I know her thoroughly and nownowhas not she escaped out of my house even now  ROB  But

partner better  BEV  And without considering that I forlorn as I am and my sister therewho is as well inclined to a matrimonial game of romps as any girl in Christendom must both of us sit down and

know that is the happiness of my lifebut  BELIN  But what Sir  BEV  I am afraid I have done something to offend you  BELIN  To offend me  BEV  Yes Belinda I should have been of the party last night I own I should it was a sufficient inducement for me that you was to be there it was my fault and you I see are piqued at it  BELIN  I piqued  BEV  I see you are and you was so last night tooI have heard it all and in mere resentment you directed all your discourse to Mr Bellmont  BELIN  If I did it was merely accidental  BEV  No it was deliberately doneforgive my rash folly in refusing the invitationI meant no manner of harm  BELIN  Who imagines you did Sir  BEV  I beg your pardon Belinda you take offence too lightly  BELIN  Ha ha what have you taken into your head nowthis uneasiness is of your own makingI have taken nothing ill Sir  BEV  You could not but take it ill but by all that's amiable about you I meant not to incur your displeasureforgive that abrupt answer I sentI should have made a handsomer apology  BELIN  Apologywhat occasion was there for any thing moreyou said you was preengaged did not you  BEV  I said so I own it and beg your pardon  BELIN  Beg my pardon for what ha ha  BEV  I only meant  BELIN  Ha ha can you think I see any thing in your message to be offended at Sir  BEV  Where you were concerned I own I should have expressed myself with more delicacy than those hasty words I am engaged and can't wait upon you tonight I should have told you that my heart was with you though necessity dragged me another waybut this omission you resentedI could learn since the spirits you were in the whole evening though I enjoyed nothing in your absenceI could hear the sallies of your wit the sprightliness of your conversation and on whom your eyes were fixed the whole night  BELIN  They were fixed upon Mr Bellmont you think  BEV  Ay and fixed with delight upon him seemed negociating the business of love before the whole company  BELIN  Upon my word Sir whoever is your author he has misinformed you and let me tell you you alarm me with these fancies and you know I have often told you that you are of too refining a temperyou create for yourself imaginary misunderstandings and then are ever entering into explanationsI assure you Mr Beverley this watching for intelligence from the spies and misrepresenters of conversation betrays the symptoms of jealousy and I would not be married to a jealous man for the world  BEV  Now she is seeking occasion to break off    aside    Jealousy Ma'am can never get admission into my breast I am of too generous  a temper a certain delicacy I own I have I value the opinion of my friends and when there are circumstances of a doubtful aspect I am glad to set things in their true lightand surely Belinda if I do so with others surely with you on whom my happiness depends to desire a favourable interpretation of my words and actions  BELIN  But these little humours may grow up and gather into the fixed disease of jealousy at last    Lady Restless crosses the stage and rings a bell at the door    And there nowthere goes a lady who is a victim to her own fretful imagination  BEV  Who is the lady pray
