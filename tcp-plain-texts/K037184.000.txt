Man  Again the Tyrant cruel and perfidious  Retracts his Promise and defies th' Almighty  In vain successive Wonders plead our Wrongs  And desolated  Egypt  groans in vain  Woman  Yes  Pharaoh  's ruthless Hand that has so long  Bow'd  Israel  's Neck to stern Oppression's Yoke  Now wastes with various Plagues his own Domains  And spreads o'er  Egypt  Want Disease and Death  AIR by the Man and Woman alternately  Woman  The gliding Stream whose silver Wave  To thirsty Lips Refreshment gave  The thirsty Lip refresh'd no more  But stain'd with Blood its wond'ring Shore  Flocks Herds and Fields and Men complain  All Nature mourns but mourns in vain  Man  The faithful Steer untimely died  The Morn her genial Dews denied  And Wrath ordain'd the Skies to pour  Of Flame and Frost a mingled Show'r  Flocks Herds and Fields and Men complain  All Nature mourns but mourns in vain  Woman  The Hind looks round with boding Fears  The rising Corn his Anguish cheers  The Locust comes his Hopes are fled  And unavailing Tears are shed  Flocks Herds and Fields and Men complain  All Nature mourns but mourns in vain  RECITATIVE  Man  These Plagues are past and now tremendous Sight  Where late the golden Spires of haughty  Memphis  With dazzling Brightness sparkled to the Eye  Darkness alone is visible there seems  A Wall of Darkness rais'd from Earth to Heav'n  It looks like Nature's Limits and beyond  Th' affrighted Fancy feigns the waste Dominions  Of Chaos and of Night  Woman  Now let us fly  What now forbids that careless of his Will  Whom Darkness binds and Hunger must destroy  We quit for ever this detested Land  And seek the promis'd Heritage of Heav'n  Man  What can forbid and lo in happy Hour  The hoary Elders of our Tribes approach  AIR by the Man  Freedom's Charms alike engage  Blooming Youth and hoary Age  Time itself can ne'er destroy  Freedom's pure and lasting Joy  Love and Friendship never gave  Half their Blessings to the Slave  None are happy but the Free  Bliss is born of Liberty  Enter the Elders of  Israel  RECITATIVE  Man  O Fathers wherefore should these golden Hours  Serve but like common Time to measure Life  Why not improved to bless that Life with Freedom  st Elder  Taught from above the Prophet is our Guide  Him let us follow patient and resign'd  So shall the Simple and the Weak be found  Strong in his Strength and in his Wisdom wise  d Elder  Behold he comes with Joy and Rev'rence greet  The Friend of  Israel  and the Sent of Heav'n  CHORUS  Hail belov'd of Man and God  Born to sway the mystic Rod  Born proud Tyrants to abase  Still befriend thy kindred Race  Glorious where thy Life began  Hail belov'd of God and Man  Moses  Cease or the Strains from Gratitude that flow  Direct to Heav'n and give  JEHOVAH  Praise  st Elder  For thee we praise him in his chosen Hour  And sure that Hour is come we follow thee  Wilt thou not lead us forth while now the Tyrant  Involv'd in Darkness knows not what we do  Moses  Not yet this Hour the dreadful Glooms disperse  And Light returns to  Pharaoh  Woman  Ah not so  Revenge will then make Tyranny more dreadful  Waste not the Lives one Day's Delay may cost  Nor add one Day to Bondage worse than Death  Though Time has crown'd thy hoary Brow with Wisdom  Still let thy Pity feel for Youth and Beauty  AIR  In blooming Youth the gentle Maid  For tender Joys and Cares design'd  Is doom'd by rudest Toils to fade  By Summers Suns and Winters Wind  Those Eyes in silent Tears are drown'd  Where Love shou'd light his constant Flame  And pale the languid Cheek is  ound  Which Pleasure's rosy Hue shou'd claim  RECITATIVE  Man  Think of our Youth who waste their early Strength  In sordid Labours and scarce reach to Manhood  Woman  Think of the Babe whose Tears in vain require  The Hand that driv'n to other Toils fulfils  A Mother's Duty with Delight no more  st Elder  Think of the hoary Heads that bow beneath  Opprobrious Burdens think of wasted  Egypt  Her suff'ring Children cruel by Compulsion  Like us the Victims of a Tyrant's Crimes  Moses  What mean your Words what would ye that I do  d Elder  Prolong this Darkness till our Tribes escape  Moses  ForbearAlas ye know not what ye ask  The stubborn Will of  Egypt  's haughty Prince  Must stand subdu'd and his own Word dismiss ye  This Land of Bondage shall ye quit with Glory  And pass in Triumph by the Gates of  Memphis  I go to prove him trust in Heav'n and live  CHORUS  We hear thee and with Transport trust  Thy Rod shall make the Tyrant just  And all our Wrongs atone  Where'er the circling Sun displays  His rising or his setting Rays  Our Triumph shall be known  SCENE II  The Palace at  Memphis  during the Darkness  Pharaoh Sephres  and Attendants  RECITATIVE  Pharaoh  If there be any near me let him speak  Sephres  May  Pharaoh  live for ever  Pharaoh  O my Son  Ill suits such greeting with this dreadful Gloom  This Gloom impervious to the Noontide Beam  If the blest Sun still rises on the World  Speak yet again that I may hear thy Voice  And Darkness may be Solitude no more  Sephres  I speak but yet my Voice almost affrights me  Three Times the circling Hours have brought the Morn  To other Realms if other Realms there are  Which yet the Morn revisits since these Eyes  Were blest with chearful Light nor yet has Sound  Divided once the long deep deathlike Silence  AIR by  Pharaoh  O Darkness dreaded not in vain  My Soul admits thy awful Train  With me thy kindred Terrors dwell  And Joy and Peace and Hope expel  AIR by  Sephres  O chearing Light of Life and Joy  Fair Emblem wilt thou ne'er return  No more thy golden Shafts employ  No more with genial Radiance burn  RECITATIVE  Pharaoh  This Darkness is to DeathGreat Nature dics  And we but perish with herHark  A Symphony a confused Expression of Joy as of Shouts at a Distance  Again  Sephres  It seem'd a distant Shoutbehold the Cause  Transporting Sight a dim but bright'ning Ray  Shoots Eastward hence and struggles through the Gloom  Pharaoh  It does increasing and prevailing still  Sephres  A wild tumultuous Joy throbs at my Heart  From Terror scarce distinguish'd still I tremble  Pharaoh  I am again myself and scorn the Fears  The vain fantastic Fears that Darkness breeds  Let the loud Trumpets sound that if the Sun  Still combats with a Foe not yet subdu'd  The Sound may lend him Aid and let your Song  Conjure the Pow'rs of Darkness from the Sky  SONG and CHORUS  Hence ye Pow'rs of Death and Night  Hence the Living claim the Light  By your dreary Realm that lies  Stretch'd beneath infernal Skies  By the Ghosts that own your Sway  Ghosts that hate the chearful Day  Hence ye Pow'rs of Death and Night  Hence the Living claim the Light  Enter  Moses  RECITATIVE  Pharaoh  Enter not here thou Enemy of Man  Moses  Here I must enter for again commission'd  By him whose Hand has been so ost upon thee  I come to claim an injur'd Nation's Freedom  Pharaoh  Darest thou again with that illomen'd Voice  Urge thy Demand and tempt again my Mercy  Moses  What shou'd I fear from thee I trust in God  Sever these Limbs in Fragments small as Dust  And give them scatter'd to the Winds of Heav'n  If he commands united in a Moment  Again as now they shall appear before thee  To work his Pleasure and denounce his Vengeance  Enter  Menytis  Menytis  O Friend O Brother wherefore are ye thus  Change these fierce Looks of Anger and Defiance  For such as heretofore ye took and gave  Remember  Pharaoh  he who stands before thee  Our Father's Sister cherish'd as her child  Remember  Moses  what thou wast to  Pharaoh  His Friend the favour'd Brother of his Choice  AIR by  Menytis  Friendship is the Joy of Reason  Dearer yet than that of Love  Love but lasts a transient Season  Friendship makes the Bliss above  Who would lose the sacred Pleasure  Felt when Soul with Soul unites  Other Blessings have their Measure  Friendship without Bound delights  Pharaoh  In vain you urge me outrag'd and defy'd  Henceforth the Wretch shall see my Face no more  Moses  Well hast thou said this Object of thy Scorn  Henceforth indeed shall see thy Face no more  DUET  Pharaoh  and  Moses  Phar  Fly and see my Face no more  Moses  I will see thy Face no more  Phar  Dread my Rage  Moses  Thy Rage I scorn  Dread thyself the rising Morn  Phar  Vain thy Menacehence away  Moses  Tyrant I disdain to stay  CHORUS  Hence and try thy Arts again  Vain the past the future vain  Pharaoh shall thy Pow'r defy  And with Glory live or die  PART II  SCENE I  Goshen  the Time Evening  First and Second  Israelite  and  Chorus  RECITATIVE  st Israelite  When shall our Labours and our Wrongs be past  The Rising Sun beholds our Toils commenc'd  The Setting comes and sees them still unfinish'd  d Israelite  O that untroubled by deccitful Hopes  Content still sweeten'd Toil and welcome Rest  Still crown'd our Evening when the Day was past  Enter  Moses  Moses  Cease to repine nor with ungrateful murmurs  Accuse the wise Benevolence of Heav'n  st Israelite  'Tis not in Mortals to endure the Pains  That Rage now adds to Bondage and be silent  AIR  At early Dawn the lab'ring Hind  With rustic Song his Toil beguiles  Who hopes at dusky Eve to find  In homely Cot domestic Smiles  But he whose sad Reward is Pain  Whom Sorrow meets at his Return  Can ne'er the Load of Life sustain  To hide his Anguish ne'er can learn  RECITATIVE  Moses  Mark me by me your Strength  JEHOVAH  speaks  E'er yet Tomorrow's Dawn shall tinge the Skies  The Sons of  Israel  shall depart from  Egypt  d Israelite  If this were certain all our Toils and Pains  Would in a Moment be like Dreams forgotten  Moses  That this is certain let the Signs attest  Which he who speaks by me by me has wrought  AIR  By Doubts and Fears no more deprest  To Hope we give the joyful Breast  To Hope and all her smiling Train  Great Nature's Lord our Guard and Guide  Our Hearts in Nature's Lord confide  And  Egypt  's haughty Pow'r disdain  SCENE II  The outward Court of the Palace at  Memphis  the Time two Hours after Midnight  An Officer of the Guard To him another Officer of the Palace  RECITATIVE  d Officer  Thy Looks are wild and Terror's in thy Eye  What of this dreadful Night upon thy Watch  Has Rumour brought thee  st Officer  Nothing have I learnt  What my own Thoughts suggest I fear to tell thee  d Officer  What hast thou heard or seen while others slept  st Officer  As here I kept my Watch some two Hours since  At Depth of Midnight when the World around  Was hush'd in awful Silence next to Death  A sudden Blast impetuous from the South  Shook the proud Palace to its Base and soon  A gen'ral Groan on all Sides coho'd round me  Loud Shrieks of Terror and the languid Moans  Of Grief succeded ever and anon  A ghastly Face rush'd by me full of Haste  And Terror and Distraction Oft I ask'd  What had befall'n 'em but gain'd no Reply  Save broken Words and frantic Exclamations  d Officer  Where will Destruction stop the eldest Hope  Of ev'ry House as far as yet we learn  This Night expir'd and  Egypt  's proudest Boast  Heir to her Empire now lies cold in Death  AIR  Death where'er we turn we meet  Death has broke through Nature's Bounds  Death the sighing gales repeat  Death from ev'ry Echo sounds  RECITATIVE  st Officer  See where the Sister of our King approaches  With all the weeping Virgins of her Train  d Officer  They hoped to grace the Nuptials of the Prince  A softer Band had bound him had not Heav'n  Giv'n up our Land to Darkness and to Death  Enter  Menytis  and a Chorus of  Egyptian  Virgins  AIR by  Menytis  Alas in blooming Youth he died  E'er hallow'd Love his Virtue blest  When conscious Blushes warm'd the Bride  And tender Tumults fill'd her Breast  Ye Virgins now no Myrtles twine  No Roses for his Bed prepare  In Silence o'er his Grave incline  And strew the sading fragrance there  CHORUS  No more our Hands shall Myrtles twine  Nor Roses for his Bed prepare  Our Heads shall o'er his Grave incline  And fading sweets be scatter'd there  RECITATIVE  Menytis  O that my Tears had yet in Time prevail'd  And  Israel  's Tribes had been dismiss'd from  Egypt    st Virgin  What unknown Woes may  Pharaoh  yet incur  If yet he grants not the Demand of  Moses    Menytis  Your Fears if yet there can be ought to fear  Are vain for all that  Israel  asks is giv'n  Now on their March they leave this wasted Land  And shake the Dust of  Egypt  from their Feet  So will'd the King who deaf to Comfort's Voice  On the bare Earth lies stretch'd in silent Sorrow  AIR by  Menytis  How vain is Grandeur's purple Pride  And Guards and Roofs of Gold how vain  Through circling Guards can Sorrow glide  And golden Roofs are claim'd by Pain  Give me ye Pow'rs unknown to dwell  Remote from Pomp and Care and Strife  Secure from Passions that rebel  And shelter'd from the Storms of Life  RECITATIVE  st Officer  But see the KingContending Passions shake him  Enter  Pharaoh  Pharaoh  Accursed SorcererBut in vain I curse him  I am myself the Murderer of my Child  Why did I fear to take a forfeit Life  A Life twice forfeitHe was once an Outcast  Of a vile Slave preserv'd with erring Pity  And once a Murderer flying unpursu'd  My Thoughts are wilder than a Whirlwind's Rage  Yes I will follow him to Nature's Verge  And wou'd to bottomless Perdition's Gulph  Leap after him  Menytis  My gracious Lord  Pharaoh  No more  DUET  Menytis  and  Pharaoh  Men  O let my Voice Attention gain  Pha  Thy Suit the World should urge in vain  Men  Let then my Tears thy Pity move  Pha  Thy Tears tho' Blood would fruitless prove  Men  O for thy Life  Pha  Forbear  Men  O stay  Pha  My Life I scorn  Men  For mine  Pha  Away  Exit  Pharaoh  the rest following  SCENE III  The Borders of the  Red Sea  Moses  and the  Israelites  on their March  RECITATIVE  st Israelite  The Joy of sudden Freedom is too great  Th' expanding Heart is pain'd to give it Room  d Israelite  My Spirits all mount upward and I feel  As I could tread on Air even Nature's Wants  Almost I could forget and Toil and Hunger  Lose their Effects upon me as I march  AIR  Less are youthful Charms to Love  Less is Danger to the Brave  Less to Misers Gold must prove  Less than Freedom to the Slave  CHORUS  This is sacred Truth's Decree  Truth the Friend of human Race  Death is Honour to the Free  Life is to the Slave Disgrace  Enter Messenger  RECITATIVE  Messenger  Cease the loud Triumph of your joyful Strains  Egypt  's stern Tyrant dreadful and resistless  As the blue Pestilence that rides the Wind  Enrag'd pursues us with prevailing Speed  The rapid Chariot plows the smoking Ground  And the proud Courser scorns our tardy flight  CHORUS  O Words of Horror dreadful Sound  A thousand Deaths beset us round  Our Hope is vain and vain our Pray'r  'Tis Anguish all 'tis all Despair  Enter  Moses  RECITATIVE  Moses  So soon ye Faithless can ye sear so soon  Turn not your Eye to yonder idle Pomp  Of mortal Foes the Children of the Dust  But look before ye where the cloudy Pillar  That marks your destin'd Way to Peace and Safety  Veils the dread Pow'r who from himself began  And fills Eternity before whose Eye  All Nature stands rebuk'd  st Israelite  Forgive th' involuntary Fears that rise  From Dangers such as these so great so sudden  Behind us drives the Foe whose Iron Hand  Our suffering Tribes have felt and mourn'd so long  Before us with inexorable Wave  The Sea far sounding beats the sullen Shore  Moses  Let me while thus I lift my Hand to Heav'n  Teach ye once more to trust eternal Truth  As he lifts up his Rod the Sea is supposed to be suddenly divided  A Symphony expressing the Commotion of the Waters  CHORUS  It parts it parts the liquid Walls behold  Of Wave on Wave in foaming volumes roll'd  In Terror fix'd the Sea forgets to flow  And leaves unveil'd the hoary Gulph below  In Safety pass ye chosen Tribes along  And let the parted Deep resound your Song  PART III  SCENE I  The  Red Sea  the  Israelites  passing on before the  Egyptians  First and Second  Israelite  RECITATIVE  st Israelite  Still I rejoice with trembling when I gaze  On this stupendous Precipice above  And pass this yet untrodden Gulph below  My Heart dies in me and my Fears prevail  d Israelite  Fear not the Hand that guides us will protect  Till we have pass'd in Safety to the Shore  In Times to come when we shall rest in Peace  Beneath the Shade of our own Vine and Figtree  Rememb'rance of our Dangers past will raise  Repose to Pleasure Pleasure to Delight  AIR  How blest is he whose tranquil Mind  When Life declines recalls again  The Years that Time has cast behind  And wins Delight from Toil and Pain  So when the transient Storm is past  The sudden Gloom and driving Show'r  The sweetest Sunshine is the last  The lov'liest is the Evening Hour  RECITATIVE  st Israelite  But see our Foes pursue us  d Israelite  Far behind  Discomfited they linger and from hence  Not ev'n their glitt'ring Armour is descry'd  st Israelite  Their Arms we see not for the guiding Cloud  That led our Van now guards us in the Rear  The Way grows sleep ascending from th' Abyss  Behold the Thousands that pass on before us  A moving Column rising Rank o'er Rank  Swarm on th' Ascent and quicken all the Way  CHORUS  'Tis done the wond'rous Journey's o'er  They quit the deep they gain the Shore  They view with Joy the Path they trod  And hark their Shout ascends to God  SCENE II  The Borders of the  Red Sea  in the Desart  The  Israelites  as just landed on the Coast  RECITATIVE  st Israelite  Still stands the Deep divided still our Foes  For now I see their glitt'ring Arms advance  d Israelite  Stand backbehold the Prophetgive him Way  Enter  Moses  Moses  Fear not the Hosts that now enrag'd pursue  Though now ye see them ye shall see no more  Ye Waters who at his Command whose Voice  First call'd ye forth from Nothing left disclos'd  The World's Foundations now again return  And at his Bidding in your Channel flow  AIR  Again the Voice of GOD is heard  Again the rushing Waters meet  The Waters that beheld and scar'd  Now pay their Homage at his Feet  RECITATIVE  Israelite  Behold where boasting Egypt lies o'erwhelm'd  O'er rattling Chariots and the shouting Host  Flows the calm Wave now silent and at rest  Moses  Thus o'er the Race of Man and all his Works  The Stream of Time divided for a Moment  Shall close for ever but supreme o'er all  GOD  still remains eternal and unchang'd  To him with humble Adoration bend  And while ye triumph o'er the Sons of  Egypt  Let Pity still remember they were Men  AIR  Israelite  O God of Hosts to Thee we raise  With humble Hearts our Songs of Praise  A weak alas and guilty Race  Our Merit claims no partial Grace  No partial Grace thy Judgments show  The Father thou of all below  And Life and Death alike proclaim  To Man the Glorics of thy Name  RECITATIVE  Moses  But see the Deep returns the lifeless Corse  And spreads the Shore with Trophies of the Dead  These were our Foesbut Enmity and Life  Shou'd cease togetherin the silent Grave  All is unbroken Peace th' Oppressor there  From troubling ceases and the Weary rest  st Israelite  Far far from us be unrelenting Rage  Revenge and all the Furies of the Mind  If God long suff'ring shall chastise our Foes  Let us thus warn'd rejoice with Fear before him  In just Displeasure if our Crimes are punish'd  Not vainly chasten'd let us kiss the Rod  To these whate'er from Pity they can take  Let Pity give for Man is born to Woe  AIR  With gen'rous Tears the Dead deplore  They wake to Love or War no more  No longer now destroy or save  The Dead alas no more are Foes  With pious Hands their Limbs compose  And give what all must want a Grave  RECITATIVE  Moses  To God this Sacrifice of Love is pleasing  For God is Lovestupendous are his Ways  Ye cannot fathom themthe Depth and Height  Surpass your utmost Reach of Thought to me  By Parts disclos'd through Clouds and dimly seen  Yet know these Wonders are not for this Age  Nor you ye chosen from the Nations wrought  These are but Types the Substance is to come  The Prince of Peace who though from  Jacob  sprung  Was yet ere Abra'ms Day he from worse Bondage  Shall like a Shepherd lead his chosen Race  To yet a better Canaan there to quaff  The Streams of Life and taste immortal Fruit  CHORUS  Praise to the Lord who reigns supreme above  Praise to the mystic Wonders of his Love  Renew the grateful Song of Ages past  The Song through Heaven's eternal Year shall last  THE END
