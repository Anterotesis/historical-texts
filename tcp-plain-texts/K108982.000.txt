SYLVIA  Miss HALLAM  CAELIA  Miss POITIER  SCENE The COUNTRY  THE SHEPHERD's ARTIFICE  ACT I  SCENE I  A GROVE  STREPHON ALEXIS  ALEXIS  WHY how now Strephon you're a pretty swain  Thus to indulge a foolish lovesick strain  Throw off your sadness like your friend be gay  And revel in the sweets of blooming May  STREPHON  Blame not Alexis if I seek the grove  To muse on Caelia and indulge my love  While she inflexible denies relief  What's left for me but solitude and grief  AIR  All endeavours fruitless prove  Former pleasures to regain  Sunk in helpless hopeless love  Can the slave escape his chain  Leave O leave me to endure  Probe not wounds that rend my heart  When the patient's past a cure  Med'cine but augments his smart  SCENE II  ALEXIS alone  O silly silly swain to pine and sigh  Pierc'd by a vain coquet's forbidding eye  She loves I know and if my scheme be right  The mystery shall soon be brought to light  AIR  The trifling maid who idly vain  Contemns a faithful lover's pain  His torment all her joy  Who changeful as an April day  With captive hearts delights to play  As infants with a toy  Deserves of Cupid's bitter draught  To taste a drop and from his shaft  A stroke or two to feel  Then tremble Nymph for taught by me  Strephon shall soon give wounds to thee  No vanity can heal  SCENE III  A COTTAGE  CAELIA SYLVIA  SYLVIA  You're not the generous Caelia you'd be thought  If thus you use a heart your beauty caught  CAELIA  Sylvia no more I ne'er will change my mind  Nor to a sighing lovesick swain be kind  I triumph proudly in young Strephon's pain  And treat his abject passion with disdain  AIR  My bosom is proof against transports and vows  The fawning of treacherous man  Who by artful grimaces by cringing and bows  Ensnares ev'ry woman he can  His transport is false and his vows are a cheat  His oaths and his cringing a lie  Each practic'd alone their desire to compleat  And gain what we ought to deny  II  Poor Daphne too soon own'd the flame in her breast  Too easy too quickly was won  Her swain from that moment a rover confess'd  Forsook her a maiden undone  And know if young Strephon had conquer'd my heart  To my wish were none pleasing as he  I sooner would die than this secret impart  'Till I prov'd he has truly lov'd me  SCENE IV  SYLVIA alone  What inconsistent things are girls in this  To plague their swains they rob themselves of bliss  I love Alexis he's a charming youth  Each loves the other and dares tell the truth  AIR  Ye flowers that bloom in yonder mead  Where flows the crystal tide  And nibbling lambkins sportive feed  Along the current's side  Ye oft have seen and smil'd to see  My love to him his love to me  II  Witness ye flocks ye herds ye fawns  That o'er the pastures stray  Witness ye mountains groves and lawns  Each painted child of May  The greatest bliss I ere can prove  Is to return my shepherd's love  SCENE V  A GROVE  STREPHON CAELIA  STREPHON  Turn O turn relentless fair  Pity hapless Strephon's pain  Raise him from the last despair  Smile and bid him live again  CAELIA  Prythee lay aside your folly  How can I or take or give  Sprightly mirth or melancholy  But if that contents youlive  STREPHON  Too well you know your art and pow'r  Ev'ry way my woes to calm  The wound will heal from that sweet hour  Wherein you pour a friendly balm  CAELIA  Truth I pity your condition  But if your poor heart must bleed  'Till I act your kind physician  Your case is desperate indeed  SCENE VI  STREPHON ALEXIS  ALEXIS  Strephon I've found a way to ease your woe  In Caelia's breast teach jealousy to glow  Swear that my Sylvia reigns within your breast  About itleave to her and me the rest  STREPHON  What means my friend  ALEXIS  No questions but away  I'll teach my Sylvia what part she's to play  And trust me Caelia quickly shall confess  Her love and grant your longwish'd happiness  AIR  In ev'ry fertile valley  Where nature spreads the grass  Her silly conduct rally  To ev'ry lad and lass  Where weary reapers labour  With Sylvia gay be seen  Or to the pipe and tabor  Light tripping o'er the green  II  Where cowslips sweetly smiling  Bedeck the verdant shade  Appear the hours beguiling  Or head some gay parade  Pursue these methods boldly  Nor sink in hopeless grief  The fair once treated coldly  Will quickly grant relief  SCENE VII  STREPHON alone  O happy thought this artifice may prove  A full amends for all my anxious love  AIR  Haughty Caelia still disdaining  Ne'er shall triumph o'er my heart  Ne'er will I with mean complaining  Sue for comfort to my smart  I'll appear the careless rover  Let her coquettish airs affect  Like a gay a happy lover  Treat contempt with cold neglect  II  Ne'er ye fair ones damp the passion  Where with honour love attends  Never cross with indignation  Love that fairest truth commends  Constant minds alike disdaining  Insincerity and fraud  Are their utmost wish obtaining  While their hope their hearts applaud  SCENE VIII  A VILLAGE  NYMPHS and SWAINS SYLVIA forming a Wreath of Flowers  AIR  How lavish Nature's liberal hand  With verdure decks the ground  How pleasing o'er the cultur'd land  In droves the kidlings bound  Glad plenty smiles on ev'ry plain  In ev'ry grove delight  Content's soft joys in ev'ry swain  With happy love unite  SCENE IX  ALEXIS SYLVIA  ALEXIS  My Sylvia something for your private ear  Such a designpoor Caelia  SYLVIA  Ever dear  And ever welcome ev'ry thing from thee  Brings mirth brings happiness and joy to me  DUETTO  SYLVIA  Sweeter glides the passing hour  Sweeter sings the feather'd throng  When my shepherd in the bower  Joins their sweet melodious song  ALEXIS  Softer coos the plaintive turtle  Gayer beauties deck the grove  Greener far appears the myrtle  When I'm blest with Sylvia's love  Smiling nature shall her treasure  Cease to spread on blooming mead  SYLVIA  Swains no more repeat their pleasure  In the bow'r on tuneful reed  ALEXIS  Reapers cease to use the fickle  SYLVIA  Leafy woods forbear to move  ALEXIS  When Alexis wanders fickle  SYLVIA  When thy Sylvia wanders fickle  BOTH  Or desires a second Love  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  Before a Cottage  CAELIA musing  SAY if to Strephon I confess my flame  Yield to his wish and own a conqu'ror's claim  Will he not soon forsake such easy charms  And leave me slighted for another's arms  He will he will therefore to prove his heart  I'll yet resist him and prolong his smart  AIR  Since artful man so oft betrays  By subtle wiles and hardy ways  Our weak unguarded sex  By oaths dissembl'd sighs and fears  To melt our hearts to charm our ears  And still our minds perplex  In revenge I'm determin'd to treat him with scorn  And shew him a nymph can perplex in her turn  II  But Strephon's heart with purest fire  With kindest love and fond desire  Has ever warmly glow'd  Yet his may be like all the rest  A treach'rous bait to snare the breast  And so my fears forbode  Those fears then shall teach me to treat him with scorn  And shew him a nymph can insnare in her turn  SCENE II  ALEXIS CAELIA  ALEXIS  Death Furies Woman  CAELIA  What's the matter now  ALEXIS  From henceforth who will trust a female vow  Nymph we are both deceiv'd your Strephon feign'd  For you no love within his bosom reign'd  Sylvia in secret still possest his heart  Their passion's mutual  CAELIA  Oh My bursting heart  What says Alexis  ALEXIS  Nay by Jove 'tis true  And here he comes to mock both me and you  SCENE III  ALEXIS STREPHON CAELIA  STREPHON  AIR  O where my Sylvia charming maid  Of me unmindful dost thou rove  Haste haste thee quickly to my aid  And tune my jarring soul to love  Thy charms can ev'ry doubt controul  Can anxious cares at once destroy  If you but smile my raptur'd soul  No impulse feels but softest joy  So Venus smil'd to charm her love  And bid his angry fury cease  The God with rapture did approve  And sigh'd his soul to gentle peace  ALEXIS  O Traitor  CAELIA  MonsterBut on second thought  I'll hide my rage  ALEXIS  Aside to Strephon  Well said the gudgeon's caught  CAELIA  Down down my heart Strephon I'm pleas'd to hear  You've got a mistress who'll be less severe  Cruel I am but Sylvia we are sure  Inflicts no wounds but she'll be glad to cure  TRIO  ALEXIS  Happy swain thy cares are over  Lovesick whims no more perplex  Thoughtful roams no more the lover  Seeking means himself to vex  CAELIA  In my life I ne'er felt greater pleasure  My pains ev'ry moment are varied  Grief rageLord I long beyond measure  To see you both happily married  STREPHON  Blest with Sylvia's graceful beauty  Sweetly life will pass away  Inclination leading duty  Love the night and joy the day  ALEXIS  O rare  CAELIA  Confusion  STREPHON  Love and Duty  ALEXIS  Never shall around you wait  STREPHON  Ever will around us wait  CAELIA  Ever must around them wait  ALEXIS  'Sdeath  CAELIA  Distraction  STREPHON  Graceful Beauty  ALEXIS  This we know alas too late  STREPHON  Happy envy'd blissful state  CAELIA  Hapless hopeless cruel fate  SCENE IV  A GROVE  CAELIA alone  Tell me gentle God of Love  Why oppress'd I wand'ring rove  Why in grief I muse alone  Suff'ring pains 'till now unknown  Heal my anguish ease my heart  Convert to joy this piercing smart  Let calm content succeed this pain  And grant me happiness again  SCENE V  CAELIA SYLVIA  SYLVIA  Caelia my dear  CAELIA  Begone ungrateful maid  My love you're wrong'd my friendship you've betray'd  How have you thus my Strephon's heart abus'd  SYLVIA  Ease and good nature were the arts I us'd  I smil'd you frown'd the swain could I deter  Sunshine to low'ring weather all prefer  AIR  The God of Love will ever  Heap blessings on the pair  Where pleasing's the endeavour  Both of the swain and fair  Believe me kind goodnature  Of beauty stands in place  Gives bloom to ev'ry feature  To ev'ry action grace  Then never slight the lover  Or draw too tight his chain  Least in the end the rover  Succeeds the dying swain  SCENE VI  CAELIA ALEXIS  ALEXIS  Stay Caelia stay a word let me entreat  Behold a shepherd falling at your feet  Each disappointed of a wish'd for spouse  Let's here in spite exchange our mutual vows  CAELIA  Alexis no Strephon I truly lov'd  Nor can my breast by other vows be mov'd  ALEXIS  A fair confession from an honest heart  Now listen to the tale that I impart  AIR  A shepherd long sigh'd for a beautiful fair  And in rapture discover'd his love  Not doubting the nymph would dispell his fond care  And his amorous transport approve  Tho' she to compassion insensible grown  No glimpse of delight would impart  When he sigh'd at her feet she reply'd with a frown  And rejoic'd at his suff'rings and smart  II  He suffer'd long time this impertinent scorn  Nor thought of upbraiding the fair  But secretly pin'd in the bow'r forlorn  Involv'd in the keenest despair  'Till his friend who observ'd him heart wounded with grief  Lamenting his fruitless desire  Resolv'd that the nymph should afford him relief  And in turn feel the force of love's fire  III  Too artful her passion she never had own'd  Tho' it triumph'd alone in her breast  But laugh'd while the shepherd in misery moan'd  And wander'd a stranger to rest  Advis'd then his bosom no longer to vex  But her haughtiness treat with disdain  He own'd a feign'd courtship her breast to perplex  And convert to delight all his pain  SCENE VII  Enter STREPHON SYLVIA SHEPHERDS and SHEPHERDESSES  STREPHON  All this is true my Caelia come my fair  Destroy each doubt and banish ev'ry care  CAELIA  What means the joy that over powers my mind  Can my dear Strephon can he yet be kind  DUETTO  STREPHON  This soft this dear concession  What words can transport find  'Tis joy beyond expression  O Caelia why so kind  CAELIA  Excuse a virgin's blushes  This tender token take  While fear my transport hushes  I wou'd but cannot speak  BOTH  This soft this dear concession  What words can transport find  'Tis joy beyonnd expression  STREPH  O Caelia why so kind  CAELIA  O Strephon why so kind  SYLVIA  Now Caelia I rejoice to call you friend  Act always thus your love can know no end  ALEXIS  Thus do you feel what I and Sylvia taste  A joy that hardly time itself can waste  For hearts so firmly knit as here are met  And minds united age shall ne'er regret  QUARTETTO  AIR  STREPHON  Can we know more real bliss  Than the happy days in view  CAELIA  No shepherd sure an hour like this  Crowns the wishes but of few  ALEXIS  Dearest nymph as happy we  Envy none tho' e'er so great  SYLVIA  Pow'r riches sure must be  Much beneath our blissful state  CHORUS  Then quickly to the neighbouring grove  Blest together let us rove  The chearful dance the suited song  To such a day as this belong  FINIS
