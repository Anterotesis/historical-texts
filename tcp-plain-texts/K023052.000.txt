 AN ESSAY ON CRITICISM  AN ESSAY ON CRITICISM  Written by Mr  POPE  Si quid novisti rectius istis  Candidus imperti si non his utere mecum  HORAT  The SECOND EDITION  LONDON Printed for  W Lewis  in  RusselStreet CoventGarden  MDCCXIII  AN ESSAY ON  CRITICISM  'TIS hard to say if greater Want of Skill  Appear in  Writing  or in  Judging  ill  But of the two less dang'rous is th' Offence  To tire our  Patience  than mislead our  Sense  Some few in  that  but Numbers err in  this    Ten Censure wrong for one who Writes amiss  A  Fool  might once  himself  alone expose  Now  One  in  Verse  makes many more in  Prose  'Tis with our  Judgments  as our  Watches  none  Go just  alike  yet each believes his  own  In  Poets  as true  Genius  is but rare  True  Taste  as seldom is the  Critick  's Share  Both must alike from Heav'n derive their Light  These  born  to Judge as well as those to Write  Qui scribit artificiose ab aliis commode scripta facile intelligere poterit  Cic ad Herenn lib  Let such teach others who themselves excell  And  censure freely  who have  written well  Authors  are partial to their  Wit  'tis true  But are not  Criticks  to their  Judgment  too  Yet if we look more closely we shall find  Omnes tacito quodam sensu sine ulla arte aut ratione quae sint in artibu ac rationibus recta ac prava dijudicant  Cic de Orat lib  Most have the  Seeds  of Judgment in their Mind  Nature affords at least a  glimm'ring Light    The  Lines  tho' touch'd but  faintly  are drawn  right  But as the slightest Sketch if justly trac'd  Is by ill  Colouring  but the more disgrac'd  So by  false Learning  is good Sense defac'd  Some are bewilder'd in the Maze of Schools  And some made  Coxcombs  Nature meant but  Fools  In search of  Wit  these lose their  common Sense    And then turn Criticks in their own Defence  Those hate as  Rivals  all that write and others  But envy  Wits  as  Eunuchs  envy  Lovers  All  Fools  have still an Itching to deride  And fain  wou'd be  upon the  Laughing Side    If  Maevius  Scribble in  Apollo  's spight  There are who  judge  still worse than he can  write  Some have at first for  Wits  then  Poets  past  Turn'd  Criticks  next and prov'd plain  Fools  at last  Some neither can for  Wits  nor  Criticks  pass  As heavy Mules are neither  Horse  nor  Ass  Those halflearn'd Witlings num'rous in our Isle  As halfform'd Infects on the Banks of  Nile    Unfinish'd Things one knows not what to call  Their Generation's so  equivocal    To tell 'em wou'd a hundred Tongues require  Or one vain Wit's that might a hundred tire  But  you  who seek to  give  and  merit  Fame  And justly bear a Critick's noble Name  Be sure  your self  and your own  Reach  to know  How far your  Genius    Taste  and  Learning  go  Launch not beyond your Depth but be discreet  And mark  that Point  where Sense and Dulness meet  Nature to all things fix'd the Limits fit  And wisely curb'd proud Man's pretending Wit  As on the Land while  here  the Ocean gains  In  other Parts  it leaves wide sandy Plains  Thus in the Soul while  Memory  prevails  The solid Pow'r of  Understanding  fails  Where Beams of warm  Imagination  play  The  Memory  's soft Figures melt away  One  Science  only will one  Genius  fit  So  vast  is Art so  narrow  Human Wit  Not only bounded to  peculiar Arts    But  oft  in  those  confin'd to  single Parts  Like Kings we lose the Conquests gain'd before  By vain Ambition still t'extend them more  Each might his  sev'ral Province  well command  Wou'd all but  stoop  to what they  understand  First follow NATURE and your Judgment frame  By her just Standard which is still the same  Unerring Nature  still divinely bright  One  clear    unchang'd  and  Universal  Light  Life Force and Beauty must to all impart  At once the  Source  and  End  and  Test  of  Art  That  Art  is best which most resembles  Her    Which still  presides  yet never does  Appear    In some fair Body thus the sprightly Soul  With Spirits feeds with Vigour fills the whole  Each Motion guides and ev'ry Nerve sustains  It self unseen  but in th'  Effects  remains  There are whom Heav'n has blest with store of Wit  Yet want as much again to manage it  For  Wit  and  Judgment  ever are at strife  Tho' meant each other's Aid like  Man  and  Wife  'Tis more to  guide  than  spur  the Muse's Steed  Restrain his Fury than provoke his Speed  The winged Courser like a gen'rous Horse  Shows most true Mettle when you  check  his Course  Those RULES of old  discover'd  not  devis'd    Are  Nature  still but  Nature Methodiz'd    Nature  like  Monarchy  is but restrain'd  By the same Laws which first  herself  ordain'd  First learned  Greece  just Precepts did indite  When to repress and when indulge our Flight  High on  Parnassus'  Top her  Sons  she show'd  And pointed out those arduous Paths they trod  Held from afar aloft th' Immortal Prize  And urg'd the rest by equal Steps to rise  From great  Examples  useful  Rules  were giv'n  She drew from  them  what they deriv'd from  Heav'n  The gen'rous Critick fann'd the  Poet's Fire    And taught the World  with Reason  to  Admire  Then Criticism the Muses Handmaid prov'd  To dress her Charms and make her more belov'd  But following Wits from that Intention stray'd  Who cou'd not win the  Mistress  woo'd the  Maid    Set up themselves  and drove a  sep'rate  Trade  Against the Poets  their own Arms  they turn'd  Sure to hate most the Men from whom they  learn'd  So modern  Pothecaries  taught the Art  By  Doctor's Bills  to play the  Doctor's Part    Bold in the Practice of  mistaken Rules    Prescribe apply and call their  Masters Fools  Some  on the Leaves of ancient Authors prey  Nor  Time  nor  Moths  e'er spoil'd so much as they  Some  dryly plain without Invention's Aid  Write dull  Receits  how Poems may be made  These lost the Sense their Learning to display  And those explain'd the Meaning quite away  You  then whose Judgment the right Course wou'd steer  Know well each ANCIENT's proper  Character    His  Fable    Subject    Scope  in ev'ry Page  Religion    Country    Genius  of his  Age    Without all these at once before your Eyes  Cavil  you may but never  Criticize  Be HOMER's Works your  Study  and  Delight    Read them by Day and meditate by Night  Thence form your Judgment thence your Notions bring  And trace the Muses  upward  to their  Spring  Still with  It self  compar'd his  Text  peruse  And let your  Comment  be the  Mantuan Muse  Virgil Eclog  Cum canerem Reges Praelia Cynthius aurem Vellit  When first young  Maro  sung of  Kings  and  Wars    Ere warning  Phoebus  touch'd his trembling Ears  Perhaps he seem'd  above  the Critick's Law  And but from  Nature's Fountains  scorn'd to draw  But when t'examine ev'ry Part he came  Nature  and  Homer  were he found the  same    Convinc'd amaz'd he checkt the bold Design  And did his Work to Rules as strict confine  As if the  Stagyrite  o'erlook'd each Line  Learn hence for Ancient  Rules  a just Esteem  To copy  Nature  is to copy  Them  Some Beauties yet no Precepts can declare  For there's a  Happiness  as well as  Care  Musick  resembles  Poetry  in each  Are nameless  Graces  which no Methods teach  And which a  MasterHand  alone can reach  Neque tam sancta sunt ista Praecepta sed hoc quicquid est Utilitas excogitavit Non negabo autem sic utile esse plerunque verum si eadem illa nobis aliud suadebit utilitas hanc relictis magistrorum autoritatibus sequemur  Quintil l cap  If where the  Rules  not far enough extend  Since Rules were made but to promote their End  Some Lucky LICENCE answers to the full  Th'Intent propos'd  that Licence  is a  Rule  Thus  Pegasus  a nearer way to take  May boldly deviate from the common Track  Great Wits sometimes may  gloriously offend    And  rise  to Faults true Criticks  dare not  mend  From vulgar Bounds with  brave Disorder  part  And  snatch  a  Grace  beyond the Reach of Art  Which without passing thro' the  Judgment  gains  The  Heart  and all its End  at once  attains  In  Prospects  thus some  Objects  please our Eyes  Which  out of  Nature's  common Order  rise  The shapeless  Rock  or hanging  Precipice  But Care in Poetry must still be had  It asks  Discretion  ev'n in  running Mad    And tho' the  Ancients  thus their  Rules  invade  As  Kings  dispense with  Laws  Themselves have made  Moderns  beware Or if you must offend  Against the  Precept  ne'er transgress its  End    Let it be  seldom  and  compell'd by Need    And have at least  Their Precedent  to plead  The Critick else proceeds without Remorse  Seizes your Fame and puts his Laws in force  I know there are to whose presumptuous Thoughts  Those  Freer Beauties  ev'n in  Them  seem Faults  Some Figures  monstrous  and  misshap'd  appear  Consider'd  singly  or beheld too  near    Which but  proportion'd  to their  Light  or  Place  Due Distance  reconciles  to Form and Grace  A prudent Chief not always must display  His Pow'rs in  equal Ranks  and  fair Array    But with th'  Occasion  and the  Place  comply  Conceal  his Force nay seem sometimes to  Fly  Those oft are  Stratagems  which  Errors  seem  Nor is it  Homer Nods  but  We  that  Dream  Still green with Bays each  ancient  Altar stands  Above the reach of  Sacrilegious  Hands  Secure from  Flames  from  Envy's  fiercer Rage  Destructive  War  and alldevouring  Age  See from  each Clime  the Learn'd their Incense bring  Hear in  all Tongues  consenting  Paeans  ring  In Praise so just let ev'ry Voice be join'd  And fill the  Gen'ral Chorus  of  Mankind    Hail  Bards Triumphant  born in happier Days  Immortal  Heirs of  Universal  Praise  Whose Honours with Increase of Ages grow  As Streams roll down  enlarging  as they flow  Nations  unborn  your mighty Names shall sound  And Worlds applaud that must not yet be  found    Oh may some Spark of  your  Coelestial Fire  The last the meanest of your Sons inspire  That on weak Wings from far pursues your Flights  Glows  while he  reads  but  trembles  as he  writes    To teach vain Wits a Science  little known    T'admire Superior Sense and  doubt  their own  OF all the Causes which conspire to blind  Man's erring Judgment and misguide the Mind  What the weak Head with strongest Byass rules  Is  Pride  the  neverfailing Vice of Fools  Whatever Nature has in  Worth  deny'd  She gives in large Recruits of  needful Pride    For as in  Bodies  thus in  Souls  we find  What wants in  Blood  and  Spirits  swell'd with  Wind    Pride  where  Wit  fails steps in to our Defence  And fills up all the  mighty Void  of  Sense    If once right Reason drives that Cloud away  Truth  breaks upon us with  resistless Day    Trust not your self but your Defects to know  Make use of ev'ry  Friend  and ev'ry  Foe  A  little Learning  is a dang'rous Thing  Drink deep or taste not the  Pierian  Spring  There  shallow Draughts  intoxicate the Brain  And drinking  largely  sobers us again  Fir'd with the Charms fair  Science  does impart  In  fearless Youth  we tempt the Heights of Art  While from the bounded  Level  of our Mind  Short Views  we take nor see the  Lengths behind    But  more advanc'd  behold with strange Surprize  New distant Scenes of  endless  Science rise  So pleas'd at first the towring  Alps  we try  Mount o'er the Vales and seem to tread the Sky  Th'  Eternal Snows  appear already past  And the first  Clouds  and  Mountains  seem the last  But  those attain'd  we tremble to survey  The growing Labours of the lengthen'd Way  Th'  increasing  Prospect tires our wandring Eyes  Hills peep o'er Hills and  Alps  on  Alps  arise  Diligenter legendum est ac poene ad scribendi sollicitudinem Nec per partes modo scrutanda sunt omnia sed perlectus liber utique ex Integro resumendus  Quintilian  A perfect Judge will  read  each Work of Wit  With the same Spirit that its Author  writ    Survey the  Whole  nor seek slight Faults to find  Where  Nature moves  and  Rapture warms  the Mind  Nor lose for that malignant  dull Delight    The  gen'rous Pleasure  to be charm'd with Wit  But in such Lays as neither  ebb  nor  flow    Correctly cold  and  regularly low    That shunning Faults one quiet  Tenour  keep  We cannot  blame  indeedbut we may  sleep  In Wit as Nature what affects our Hearts  Is not th' Exactness of peculiar Parts  'Tis not a  Lip  or  Eye  we Beauty call  But the joint Force and full  Result  of  all  Thus when we view some well proportion'd Dome  The  World  's just Wonder and ev'n  thine  O  Rome    No single Parts unequally surprize  All comes  united  to th' admiring Eyes  No monstrous Height or Breadth or Length appear  The  Whole  at once is  Bold  and  Regular  Whoever thinks a faultless Piece to see  Thinks what ne'er was nor is nor e'er shall be  In ev'ry Work regard the  Writer's End    Since none can compass more than they  Intend    And if the  Means  be just the  Conduct  true  Applause in spite of trivial Faults is due  As Men of Breeding oft the Men of Wit  T' avoid  great Errors  must the  less  commit  Neglect the Rules each  Verbal Critick  lays  For  not  to know some Trifles is a Praise  Most Criticks fond of some subservient Art  Still make the  Whole  depend upon a  Part    They talk of  Principles  but Parts they prize  And All to  one lov'd Folly  Sacrifice  Once on a time  La Mancha  's Knight they say  A certain  Bard  encountring on the Way  Discours'd in Terms as just with Looks as Sage  As e'er cou'd  D  s  of the Laws o'th' Stage  Concluding all were desp'rate Sots and Fools  That durst depart from  Aristotle  's Rules  Our Author happy in a Judge so nice  Produc'd his Play and beg'd the Knight's Advice  Made him observe the  Subject  and the  Plot    The  Manners  P  assions    Unities  what not  All which exact to  Rule  were brought about  Were but a  Combate in the Lists  left out  What Leave the Combate out  Exclaims the Knight  Yes or we must renounce the  Stagyrite  Not so by Heav'n  he answers in a Rage  Knights Squires and Steeds must enter on the Stage  The Stage can ne'er so vast a Throng contain  Then build a New or act it in a Plain  Thus Criticks of less  Judgment  than  Caprice    Curious  not  Knowing  not  exact  but  nice    Form  short Ideas  and offend in  Arts  As most in  Manners  by a  Love to Parts  Some to  Conceit  alone their Taste confine  And glitt'ring Thoughts struck out at ev'ry Line  Pleas'd with a Work where nothing's just or fit  One  glaring Chaos  and  wild Heap  of  Wit  Poets like Painters thus unskill'd to trace  The  naked Nature  and the  living Grace    With  Gold  and  Jewels  cover ev'ry Part  And hide with  Ornaments  their  Want of Art  Naturam intueamur hanc sequamur Id facillimè accipiunt animi quod agnoscunt  Quintil lib c  True Wit  is  Nature  to Advantage drest  What oft was  Thought  but ne'er so well  Exprest    Something  whose  Truth  convinc'd at Sight we find  That gives us back the Image of our Mind  As Shades more sweetly recommend the Light  So modest Plainness sets off sprightly Wit  For  Works  may have more  Wit  than does 'em good  As  Bodies  perish through Excess of  Blood  Others for  Language  all their Care express  And value  Books  as Women  Men  for  Dress    Their Praise is still  The  Style  is excellent    The  Sense  they humbly take upon Content  Words  are like  Leaves  and where they most abound  Much  Fruit  of  Sense  beneath is rarely found  False Eloquence  like the  Prismatic Glass    Its gawdy Colours spreads on  ev'ry place    The Face of Nature we no more survey  All glares  alike  without  Distinction  gay  But  true Expression  like th'unchanging  Sun    Clears  and  improves  whate'er it shines upon  It  gilds  all Objects but it  alters  none  Expression is the  Dress  of Thought and still  Appears more  decent  as more  suitable    A vile Conceit in pompous Words exprest  Is like a Clown in regal Purple drest  For diff'rent  Styles  with diff'rent  Subjects  sort  As several Garbs with Country Town and Court  Abolita abrogata retinere insolentiae cujusdam est frivolae in parvis jactantiae  Quint lib c  Opus est ut Verba a vetustate repetita neque crebra sint neque manifesta quia nil est odiosius affectatione nec utique ab ultimis repetita temporibus Oratio cujus summa virtus est perspicuitas quam sit vitiosa si egeat interprete Ergo ut novorum optima erunt maximè vetera ita veterum maximè nova  Idem  Some by  Old Words  to Fame have made Pretence  Ancients in  Phrase  meer Moderns in their  Sense    Such  labour'd Nothings  in so  strange  a Style  Amaze  th' unlearn'd and make the Learned  Smile  Unlucky as  Fungoso  in the  Ben Johnson  's Every Man in his Humour  Play  These Sparks with aukward Vanity display  What the Fine Gentlemen wore  Yesterday    And but so mimick ancient Wits at best  As Apes our Grandsires in their  Doublets  drest  In  Words  as  Fashions  the same Rule will hold  Alike Fantastick if  too New  or  Old    Be not the  first  by whom the  New  are try'd  Nor yet the  last  to lay the  Old  aside  Quis populi sermo est quis enim nisi carmine molli Nunc demum numero fluere ut per laeve severes Effugit junctura ungues scit tendere versum Non secus ac si cculo rubricam dirigat uno  Persius Sat  But most by  Numbers  judge a Poet's Song  And  smooth  or  rough  with such is  right  or  wrong    In the bright  Muse  tho' thousand  Charms  conspire  Her  Voice  is all these tuneful Fools admire  Who haunt  Parnassus  but to please their Ear  Not mend their Minds as some to  Church  repair  Not for the  Doctrine  but the  Musick  there  These  Equal Syllables  alone require  Fugiemus crebras vocalium concursiones quae vastam atque hiantem oratimem reddunt  Cic ad Herenn lib  Vide etiam  Quintil lib c  Tho' oft the Ear the  open Vowels  tire  While  Expletives  their feeble Aid  do  join  And ten low Words oft creep in one dull Line  While they ring round the same  unvary'd  Chimes  With sure  Returns  of  stillexpected  Rhymes  Wheree'er you find  the cooling Western Breeze    In the next Line it  whispers thro' the Trees    If Chrystal Streams  with pleasing Murmurs creep    The Reader's threaten'd not in vain with  Sleep  Then at the  last  and  only  Couplet fraught  With some  unmeaning  Thing they call a  Thought    A  needless Alexandrine  ends the Song  That like a wounded Snake drags its slow Length along  Leave such to tune their own dull Rhimes and know  What's  roundly smooth  or  languishingly slow    And praise the  Easie Vigor  of a Line  Where  Denham  's Strength and  Waller  's Sweetness join  'Tis not enough no Harshness gives Offence  The  Sound  must seem an  Eccho  to the  Sense  Soft  is the Strain when  Zephyr  gently blows  And the  smooth Stream  in  smoother Numbers  flows  But when loud Surges lash the sounding Shore  The  hoarse    rough Verse  shou'd like the  Torrent  roar  When  Ajax  strives some Rock's vast Weight to throw  The Line too  labours  and the Words move  slow    Not so when swift  Camilla  scours the Plain  Flies o'er th' unbending Corn and skims along the Main  Hear how  Alexander  's Feast or the Power of Musick An Ode by Mr  Dryden  Timotheus'  various Lays surprize  And bid Alternate Passions fall and rise  While at each Change the Son of  Lybian Jove  Now burns with Glory and then melts with Love  Now his fierce Eyes with sparkling Fury glow  Now Sighs steal out and  Tears begin to flow    Persians  and  Greeks  like Turns of Nature found  And the World's Victor stood subdu'd by  Sound    The Pow'r of Musick  all our Hearts allow  And what  Timotheus  was is  Dryden  now  Avoid  Extreams  and shun the Fault of such  Who still are pleas'd  too little  or  too much  At ev'ry Trifle scorn to take Offence  That always shows  Great Pride  or  Little Sense    Those  Heads  as  Stomachs  are not sure the best  Which nauseate all and nothing can digest  Yet let not each gay  Turn  thy Rapture move  For Fools  Admire  but Men of Sense  Approve    As things seem  large  which we thro'  Mists  descry  Dulness  is ever apt to  Magnify  Some the  French  Writers some our  own  despise  The  Ancients  only or the  Moderns  prize  Thus  Wit  like  Faith  by each Man is apply'd  To  one small Sect  and All are  damn'd beside    Meanly they seek the Blessing to confine  And force  that Sun  but on a  Part  to Shine  Which not alone the  Southern Wit  sublimes  But ripens Spirits in cold  Northern Climes    Which from the first has shone on  Ages past    Enlights the  present  and shall warm the  last  Tho'  each  may feel  Increases  and  Decays    And see now  clearer  and now  darker Days    Regard not then if Wit be  Old  or  New    But blame the  False  and value still the  True  Some ne'er advance a Judgment of their own  But  catch  the  spreading Notion  of the Town  They reason and conclude by  Precedent    And own  stale Nonsense  which they ne'er invent  Some judge of Author's  Names  not  Works  and then  Nor praise nor damn the  Writings  but the  Men  Of all this  Servile Herd  the worst is He  That in  proud Dulness  joins with  Quality    A constant Critick at the Greatman's Board  To fetch and carry Nonsense for my Lord  What woful stuff this Madrigal wou'd be  In some starv'd Hackny Soneteer or me  But let a  Lord  once own the happy Lines  How the Wit  brightens  How the Style  refines    Before  his  sacred Name flies ev'ry Fault  And each  exalted  Stanza  teems  with  Thought    The  Vulgar  thus through  Imitation  err  As oft the  Learn'd  by being  Singular    So much they scorn the Crowd that if the Throng  By  Chance  go right they  purposely  go wrong  So Schismatics the  plain Believers  quit  And are but damn'd for having  too much Wit  Some praise at Morning what they blame at Night  But always think the  last  Opinion  right  A Muse by these is like a Mistress us'd  This hour she's  idoliz'd  the next  abus'd    While their weak Heads like Towns unfortify'd  'Twixt Sense and Nonsense daily change their Side  Ask them the Cause  They're wiser still  they say  And still To Morrow's wiser than To Day  We think our  Fathers  Fools so wise we grow  Our wiser  Sons  no doubt will think  us  so  Once  SchoolDivines  this zealous Isle o'erspread  Who knew most  Sentences  was deepest read  Faith Gospel All seem'd made to be  disputed    And none had  Sense enough to be Confuted    Scotists  and  Thomists  now in Peace remain  Amidst their  kindred  Cobwebs in  DuckLane  If  Faith  it self has  diff'rent Dresses  worn  What wonder  Modes  in  Wit  shou'd take their Turn  Oft leaving what is Natural and fit  The  currant Folly  proves our  ready Wit    And Authors think their Reputation safe  Which lives as long as  Fools  are pleas'd to  Laugh  Some valuing those of their own  Side  or  Mind    Still make themselves the measure of Mankind  Fondly we think we honour Merit then  When we but praise  Our selves  in  Other Men  Parties in  Wit  attend on those of  State    And publick Faction doubles private Hate  Pride    Malice    Folly  against  Dryden  rose  In various Shapes of  Parsons    Criticks    Beaus    But  Sense  surviv'd when  merry Jests  were past  For rising Merit will  buoy up  at last  Might he return and bless once more our Eyes  New  S  s  and new  M  ns  must arise  Nay shou'd great  Homer  lift his awful Head  Zoilus  again would start up from the Dead  Envy  will  Merit  as its  Shade  pursue  But like a Shadow  proves  the  Substance  too  For envy'd  Wit  like  Sol  eclips'd makes known  Th'  opposing Body  's Grossness not its  own  When first that Sun too powerful Beams displays  It draws up Vapours which obscure its Rays  But ev'n those Clouds at last adorn its Way  Reflect new Glories and augment the Day  Be thou the  first  true Merit to befriend  His  Praise is lost who stays till  All  commend  Short is the Date alas of Modern Rhymes  And 'tis but just to let 'em live  betimes  No longer now that Golden Age appears  When  PatriarchWits  surviv'd a  thousand Years    Now Length of  Fame  our second Life is lost  And bare  Threescore  is all ev'n That can boast  Our Sons their Father's  failing Language  see  And such as  Chancer  is shall  Dryden  be  So when the faithful Pencil has design'd  Some  fair Idea  of the Master's Mind  Where a  new World  leaps out at his command  And ready Nature waits upon his Hand  When the ripe Colours  soften  and  unite    And sweetly  melt  into just Shade and Light  When mellowing Time does full Perfection give  And each Bold Figure just begins to  Live    The  treach'rous Colours  in few Years decay  And all the bright Creation fades away  Unhappy  Wit  like most mistaken Things  Attones not for that  Envy  which it brings  In  Youth  alone its empty Praise we boast  But soon the shortliv'd Vanity is lost  Like some fair  Flow'r  that in the  Spring  does rise  And gaily blooms but ev'n in blooming  dies  What is this  Wit  which does our Cares employ  The  Owner  's  Wife  that  other Men  enjoy  'Tis most our  Trouble  when 'tis most  admir'd    The more we  give  the more is still  requir'd    The Fame with Pains we gain but lose with ease  Sure  some  to  vex  but never  all  to  please    'Tis what the  Vicious fear  the  Virtuous shun    By  Fools  'tis  hated  and by  Knaves undone    Too much does  Wit  from  Ign'rance  undergo  Ah let not  Learning  too commence its Foe  Of old those met  Rewards  who cou'd  excell    And such were  Prais'd  as but  endeavour'd well    Tho'  Triumphs  were to  Gen'rals  only due  Crowns  were reserv'd to grace the  Soldiers  too▪  Now they who reach  Parnassus'  lofty Crown  Employ their Pains to spurn some others down  And while SelfLove each jealous Writer rules  Contending Wits  become the  Sport of Fools  But still the  Worst  with most Regret commend  For each  Ill Author  is as bad a  Friend  To what base Ends and by what abject Ways  Are Mortals urg'd by  Sacred Lust  of  Praise  Ah ne'er so  dire  a  Thirst  of Glory boast  Nor in the  Critick  let the  Man  be lost  GoodNature  and  GoodSense  must ever join  To Err is  Humane  to Forgive  Divine  But if in  Noble Minds  some Dregs remain  Not yet purg'd off of Spleen and sow'r Disdain  Discharge that Rage on more provoking Crimes  Nor fear a Dearth in these Flagitious Times  No Pardon vile  Obscenity  should find  Tho'  Wit  and  Art  conspire to move your Mind  But  Dulness  with  Obscenity  must prove  As Shameful sure as  Impotence  in  Love  In the fat Age of Pleasure Wealth and Ease  Sprung the rank Weed and thriv'd with large Increase  When  Love  was all an easie Monarch's Care  Seldom at  Council  never in a  War    Jilts  rul'd the State and Statesmen  Farces  writ  Nay  Wits  had  Pensions  and  young Lords  had  Wit    The Fair sate panting at a  Courtier  's  Play    And not a Mask went  unimprov'd  away  The modest Fan was lifted up no more  And Virgins  smil'd  at what they  blush'd  before  The following Licence of a Foreign Reign  Did all the Dregs of bold  Socinus  drain  Then  first  the  Belgian Morals  were extoll'd  We their  Religion  had and they our  Gold    Then Unbelieving Priests reform'd the Nation  And taught more  Pleasant  Methods of Salvation  Where Heav'ns free Subjects might their  Rights  dispute  Lest  God himself  shou'd seem too  Absolute  Pulpits  their  Sacred Satire  learn'd to spare  And Vice  admir'd  to find a Flatt'rer  there    Encourag'd thus Wit  's Titans  brav'd the Skies  And the Press groan'd with Licenc'd  Blasphemies  These Monsters Criticks with your Darts engage  Here point your Thunder and exhaust your Rage  Yet shun their Fault who  Scandalously nice    Will needs  mistake  an Author  into Vice    All seems Infected that th' Infected spy  As all looks yellow to the Jaundic'd Eye  Learn then what  Morals  Criticks ought to show  For 'tis but  half  a  Judge's Task  to  Know  'Tis not enough Wit Art and Learning join  In all you speak let Truth and Candor shine  That not alone what to your  Judgment  's due  All may allow but seek your  Friendship  too  Be  silent  always when you  doubt  your Sense  And speak tho'  sure  with  seeming Diffidence    Some positive persisting Fops we know  That if  once wrong  will needs be  always so    But you with Pleasure own your Errors past  And make each Day a  Critick  on the last  'Tis not enough your Counsel still be  true    Blunt Truths  more Mischief than  nice Falshoods  do  Men must be  taught  as if you taught them not  And things  ne'er known  propos'd as Things  forgot  Without  Good Breeding  Truth is not approv'd  That  only makes  Superior  Sense  belov'd  Be Niggards of Advice on no Pretence  For the  worst Avarice  is that of  Sense  With mean Complacence ne'er betray your Trust  Nor be so  Civil  as to prove  Unjust    Fear not the Anger of the Wise to raise  Those best can  bear Reproof  who  merit Praise  'Twere well might Criticks still this Freedom take  But  Appius  reddens at each Word you speak  And  stares    Tremendous  with a threatning Eye  Like some  fierce Tyrant  in  Old Tapestry    Fear most to tax an  Honourable  Fool  Whose Right it is  uncensur'd  to be dull  Such without  Wit  are Poets when they please  As without  Learning  they can take  Degrees  Leave dang'rous  Truths  to unsuccessful  Satyrs    And  Flattery  to fulsome  Dedicators    Whom when they  Praise  the World believes no more  Than when they promise to give  Scribling  o'er  'Tis best sometimes your Censure to restrain  And  charitably  let the  dull  be  vain  Your Silence there is better than your  Spite    For who can  rail  so long as they can  write  Still humming on their drowzy Course they keep  And  lash'd  so long like  Tops  are lash'd  asleep  False Steps  but help them to renew the Race  As after  Stumbling  Jades will mend their Pace  What Crouds of these impenitently bold  In  Sounds  and jingling Syllables grown old  Still run on Poets in a raging Vein  Ev'n to the Dregs and  Squeezings  of the  Brain    Strain out the last dull droppings of their Sense  And Rhyme with all the  Rage  of  Impotence    Such shameless  Bards  we have and yet 'tis true  There are as mad abandon'd  Criticks  too  Nihil pejus est iis qui paullum aliquid ultra primas litteras progressi falsam sibi scientiae persuasionem induerunt Nam cedere praecipiendi peritis indignantur velut jure quodam potestatis quo ferè hoc hominum genus intumescit imperiosi atque interim aevientes Stultitiam suam perdocent  Quintil lib ch  The Bookful Blockhead ignorantly read  With  Loads  of  Learned Lumber  in his Head  With his own Tongue still edifies his Ears  And always  List'ning to Himself  appears  All Books he reads and all he reads assails  From  Dryden  's  Fables  down to  D  y  's  Tales  With  him  most Authors steal their Works or buy  Garth  did not write his own  Dispensary  Name a new  Play  and  he  's the  Poet's Friend    Nay show'd his Faultsbut  when wou'd Poets mend  No Place so Sacred from such Fops is barr'd  Nor is  Paul  's  Church  more safe than  Paul  's  Churchyard    Nay fly to  Altars  there they'll talk you dead  For  Fools  rush in where  Angels  fear to tread  Distrustful  Sense  with modest Caution speaks  It still  looks home  and short Excursions makes  But  ratling Nonsense  in full  Vollies  breaks  And never shock'd and never turn'd aside  Bursts out  resistless with a thund'ring Tyde  But where's the Man who Counsel  can  bestow  Still  pleas'd  to  teach  and yet not  proud  to  know  Unbiass'd or by  Favour  or by  Spite    Not  dully  prepossest or  blindly  right  Tho' Learn'd  wellbred  and tho' wellbred  sincere    Modestly bold  and  Humanly severe  Who to a  Friend  his  Faults  can freely show  And gladly praise the  Merit  of a  Foe  Blest with a  Taste  exact yet unconfin'd  A  Knowledge  both of  Books  and  Humankind    Gen'rous  Converse  a  Soul  exempt from  Pride    And  Love to Praise  with  Reason  on his Side  Such once were  Criticks  such the Happy  Few    Athens  and  Rome  in better Ages knew  The mighty  Stagyrite  first left the Shore  Spread all his Sails and durst the Deeps explore  He steer'd securely and discover'd far  Led  by the Light of the  Maeonian Star  Poets a  Race  long unconfin'd and free  Still fond and proud of  Savage Liberty    Receiv'd his Laws and stood convinc'd 'twas fit  Who conquer'd  Nature  shou'd preside o'er  Wit  Horace  still charms with graceful Negligence  And without Method  talks  us into Sense  Does like a  Friend  familiarly convey  The  truest Notions  in the  easiest way  He who supream in Judgment as in Wit  Might boldly censure as he boldly writ  Yet judg'd with Coolness tho' he sung with Fire  His  Precepts  teach but what his  Works  inspire  Our Criticks  take a contrary Extream  They  judge  with  Fury  but they  write  with  Fle'me    Nor suffers  Horace  more in wrong  Translations  By  Wits  than  Criticks  in as wrong  Quotations  See  Dionysius  of  Halicarnassus  Dionysius Homer  's Thoughts refine  And call new Beauties forth from ev'ry Line  Fancy and Art in gay  Petronius  please  The  Scholar's Learning  with the  Courtier's Ease  In grave  Quintilian  's copious Work we find  The justest  Rules  and clearest  Method  join'd  Thus  useful Arms  in Magazines we place  All rang'd in  Order  and dispos'd with  Grace    Nor thus alone the curious Eye to please  But to be  found  when Need requires with Ease  The  Muses  sure  Longinus  did inspire  And blest  their Critick  with a  Poet's  Fire  An ardent  Judge  who zealous in his Trust  With  Warmth  gives Sentence yet is always  Just    Whose own  Example  strengthens all his Laws  And  Is himself  that great  Sublime  he draws  Thus long succeeding Criticks justly reign'd  Licence  repress'd and useful  Laws  ordain'd  Learning  and  Rome  alike in Empire grew  And  Arts  still  follow'd  where her  Eagles flew  From the same Foes at last both felt their Doom  And the same Age saw  Learning  fall and  Rome  With  Tyranny  then  Superstition  join'd  As that the  Body  this enslav'd the  Mind    Much was  Believ'd  but little  understood    And to be  dull  was constru'd to be  good    A second Deluge Learning thus o'errun  And the  Monks  finish'd what the  Goths  begun  At length  Erasmus  that  great    injur'd  Name  The  Glory  of the Priesthood and the  Shame    Stemm'd the wild Torrent of a  barb'rous Age    And drove those  Holy Vandals  off the Stage  But see each  Muse  in  Leo  's Golden Days  Starts from her Trance and trims her wither'd Bays  Rome  's ancient  Genius  o'er its  Ruins  spread  Shakes off the Dust and rears his rev'rend Head  Then  Sculpture  and her  SisterArts  revive  Stones leap'd to  Form  and  Rocks  began to  live    With  sweeter Notes  each  rising Temple  rung  A  Raphael  painted and a  M

Thence Arts o'er all the  NorthernWorld  advance  But  Critic Learning  flourish'd most in  France  The  Rules  a Nation born to serve obeys  And  Boileau  still in Right of  Horace  sways  But  we  brave  Britains    Foreign Laws  despis'd  And kept  unconquer'd  and  unciviliz'd    Fierce for the  Liberties of Wit  and bold  We  still  defy'd the  Romans  as  of old  Yet  some  there were among

The Muse whose early Voice you taught to Sing  Prescrib'd her Heights and prun'd her tender Wing  Her Guide now lost no more attempts to rise  But in low Numbers short Excursions tries  Content if
