 HENRY  AND  ROSAMOND  A TRAGEDY  Dedicated to Sir  John Philipps  Bart  By  WILLIAM HAWKINS  M A And Fellow of  PembrokeCollege  in OXFORD  Omne animi vitium tanto conspectius in se  Crimen habet quanto major qui peccat habetur  JUVEN  LONDON  Printed for WILLIAM OWEN at  Homer  's  Head  near  TempleBar  M DCC XLIX  TO Sir  John Philipps  Bart  SIR  _AS the following Play comes into the World under some Disadvantage I am happy in your Permission to shelter it under your Name  BUT though it did not stand in need of your Favour and Patronage upon many Accounts yet it should be remembred that in point of Propriety you have an undoubted Right to these Sheets whether you are considered as a Person sincerely attached to the University of  Oxford  or particularly interesting  yourself in the Welfare of  PembrokeCollege  to the Regard and Affection of which Society you have a double Claim both as an Ornament and a Benefactor  THE common Topics of Panegyric are obvious and I have here a fair and agreeable Opportunity of taking Notice of those many amiable Qualities which adorn you in public and private Life and for which you are so justly beloved and esteemed But my Inclination is corrected by a seasonable Thought that most Writers of the present Age have in this respect a particular Advantage over me as it is infinitely more easy to make a Character than to describe one  BESIDES it would be needless to enter into a Detail of those Praises which are already in the Mouth of every Wellwisher to his Country But I cannot resist the Impulse of Gratitude which points to that Part of your Character which more immediately affects me  your Goodnature and Condescension to which I am indebted for the Honour of your Acquaintance and Friendship and for your favourable Acceptance of the following Poem  GIVE me Leave to assure you Sir that if I am anxious for the Fate of this Tragedy one principal Motive for it is the amusing Hope of transmitting to Posterity a Monument of the Regard and Veneration I have for the Person and Character of Sir JOHN PHILIPPS I am  SIR  Your much obliged And most humble Servant WILLIAM HAWKINS  Pemb Coll  Oxon  March    ADVERTISEMENT  THIS TRAGEDY having been offered to the Managers of  DruryLane  Theatre who declined accepting it for Reasons which appeared to the Author to be rather evasive than satisfactory he thinks proper to submit it to the Judgment of the Public And as he is not conscious of having had the least Intention to give Offence and no particular Passage has been excepted against he begs no other Prepossessions in its Favour on this Account than the reasonable Allowances of a candid and impartial Disposition The Play has indeed received some considerable Alterations since it came from Mr  Garrick  's Hands But as these Alterations have no manner of Connexion with what the Author presumes was the principal Objection to the Whole for having had no clear Intimation he can only speak by Conjecture he does not think himself obliged to explain himself further on that Head  Dramatis Personae  MEN  King  HENRY  the Second  Prince  HENRY  Duke of  CORNWALL  Earl of  SALISBURY  Lord  CLIFFORD  Earl of  LEICESTER  Earl of  WINCHESTER  Earl of  SURRY  WOMEN  Queen ELINOR  ROSAMOND  HARRIANA  Guards and Attendants  SCENE  in and near  CANTERBURY  HENRY  AND  ROSAMOND  ACT I  SCENE I  Enter the Earl of  LEICESTER  LEICESTER  _IF there is that some call Eternal Justice  Let not the coward Thought perplex my Soul  My Bosom entertains Two lordly Guests  Strongplum'd Ambition and Hellgender'd Lust  The Voice of Conscience 'gainst their wild Domain  Is but a Whisper to the Whirlwind's Blast  HENRY PLANTAGENET has balk'd my Hopes  I stand the Outcast of his Peevishness  And disappointed Rival of his Love  But I have deeply laid my Plan of Vengeance  I have been long young HARRY'S Oracle  His shallow Friends walk in my Leadingstrings  If Fate give him the Crown I'll bear the Rule  And thro' the Gate of Pow'r shall find Access  To Love and ROSAMOND But see Lord SURRY  Enter Earl of  SURRY  SURRY  My Lord of LEICESTER hast thou seen the Prince  LEICESTER  No What of him  SURRY  O he is seeking thee  Thou hast fast wedg'd thyself within his Heart  He calls thee valiant faithful just and good  His greedy Ear devours thy Eloquence  He now demeans himself as we could wish  Talks of high Fame and hardy Feats of Arms  Thou hast inspir'd his Soul He swears the Crown  Whose Glories fade on HENRY'S wither'd Head  Would better flourish on his youthful Brow  In troth he is a mettled Youth my Lord  And Nature meant him well  LEICESTER  Ay or how else  Could we have taught him his own Worth or ours  Or hope to raise our Honours from the Dust  Faint Hearts will call this Treason but my Lord  'Tis injur'd Merit's Cause and we will work  To turn the Current of our lowebb'd Fortunes  Into a fuller Channel But he comes  And I have joyful Tidings for his Ear  Enter Prince  HENRY  and Earl of  WINCHESTER  P HENRY  Well our good Friend and trusty Counsellor  What from our Uncle SCOTLAND  LEICESTER  This my Liege  In Princely Terms he greets your Royal Highness  And well approves th' Alliance you have offer'd  But Words so please your Grace in forc'd Extent  Are but the Texture of fine Rhetoric  Plain Action is Sincerity's best Proof  He has encamp'd his Troops on  English  Ground  A peerless Force of Twenty thousand strong  The Earl of  Chester  with your Father's Powers  Is in full March to meet him  P HENRY  Say my Lord  On what Pretence makes he this Armament  For we must wait the Issue of a Battle  Before we can avow ourself his Friend  LEICESTER  His Claim's distinct from yours He does demand  Full Restitution of the frontier Towns  Your Father wrested from him in the Wars  And thus he seems no Party in our Cause  While we as Time shall serve may back his Quarrel  P HENRY  Why these are noble Tidings and well suit  Our Royal Purpose This looks well my Lords  I will no longer bend me to the Brow  Of this old King my Father LEICESTER SURRY  WINCHESTER Friends Companions of my Fortunes  Give me your Hands your Hearts and trust me Lords  We bravely shall outface these perilous Times  Assisted by your Loves  SURRY  My hasty Will  Is on the Wing mocking Ability  And Zeal outstrips Performance  WINCHESTER  And so in Honesty of Heart says WINCHESTER  P HENRY  Thanks to you both But my good Lord of LEICESTER  Are these same  Scots  our newcontracted Friends  Such as our Honour may lean safe upon  LEICESTER  Better ne'er mounted Glory's steep Ascent  Sir they are bold as the first Sons of Nature  Ere Pomp and Luxury debauch'd the World  Bred in a Land of Poverty and Want  They live by free uncultivated Virtue  Ease were unnatural to their Iron Hearts  For Labour is the Business of their Lives  And when they're summon'd forth to serve their Prince  Dreadful they march embody'd in the Field  As the fell Storm or Deathdispersing Bolt  That rushes on and levels all before it  P HENRY  'Tis good and henceforth will we mould our Person  Into the Attitude of Majesty  WINCHESTER  It fits your Highness well  P HENRY  Thou hast seen me LEICESTER in the Bloom of Youth  Amidst the Joys of a voluptuous Court  Where Folly spread her silken Net before me  There soft'ning Beauty breath'd the am'rous Sigh  There melting Music tun'd her Syren Voice  And the highflowing Bowl foam'd with rich Wines  Soliciting ev'n Abstinence to taste  Let me not turn my gallant Thought that Way  When Virtue's balanc'd on so nice a Poise  One Breath of Inclination turns the Scale  Farewel for ever Pleasure's nerveless Tribe  Welcome the manly Pomp of crimson War  The Heavenscaling Noise of charging Foes  The piercing Groans of Bravery laid in Duft  And all the Dangers all the Sweets of Glory  LEICESTER  Spoke like a Candidate for this World's Empire  Old HARRY'S foremost Boast is only this  That he is Father to a Prince like you  P HENRY  Goto he's weak he's weak and peevish LEICESTER  And yet 'tis current Conversation here  That he hath well acquitted him in  France  To martial Chivalry  SURRY  True it is my Liege  In open Field he'as twice o'erthrown their Powers  And now returns  LEICESTER  Ay like a Fugitive  Rather than Conqueror the doting Hero  Comes whining like an Infant for his Toy  O he is worse than distaff'd  Hercules  Where is the Honour of your  Saxon  House  If Harlots make a Tool of Majesty  Fame shall record HARRY succeeded ROSAMOND  Not HARRY HARRY  P HENRY  By the immortal Name  Of my great Ancestors it is too much  LEICESTER  O give that noble Indignation Room  Have you not Friends and Justice on your Side  Did we not all swear Fealty to your Highness  Conven'd in full Assembly by your Father  Or was it but a Shew of Majesty  A solemn Farce of State for Boys to shout at  P HENRY  Hold thereFor ev'ry Word thy Love has utter'd  Rebukes my tardy SoulO 'tis most true  As spiritless and dulltemper'd as I seem  This Head has born fair  England  's Diadem  You all remember 'twas at  Winchester  In Presence of the States of the whole Realm  The Royal Grant was made when on this Brow  Rested th' Imperial Crown which should confer  High Dignity and Share of sov'reign Sway  It was the free Donation of our Father  LEICESTER  HENRY has sure forgotten him of late  For then your Royal Highness may remember  He well discharg'd an Office that became him  P HENRY  Ay thou dost well remind me of it LEICESTER  'Twas at the sumptuous Banquet then prepar'd  I sat inthron'd the foremost of the Feast  Lord of that glorious Day 'Twas then my Father  Stept forth obsequious like a VassalPrince  Tending my Kingly Board and sure he cry'd  No Monarch e'er was serv'd so honourably  I whisper'd in his Ear his Grace of  York  That born a Prince I thought me not much honour'd  By this same Ministry of that Duke's Son  My Father was no better  LEICESTER  Nor is now  But in our foolish Fears Was that same Crown  You just now spoke of but a  Mayday  Garland  Bestow'd as on an Idiot in mere Pastime  Unnat'ral Insult By the Blood that's in you  If you have Hand or Heart or Sword revenge  Revenge yourself your Country and your Friends  Your Friends for you dishonour'd slighted scorn'd  Your Country soften'd by effeminate Rule  Yourself the stalking Shadow of a King  P HENRY  Enough my tow'ring Fancy grasps the Skies  Hence give the Word to Fate gird on my Sword  Thou faithful Guardian of my wav'ring Youth  I'll go where thou and Honour point the Way  Where are these trusty  Scots  Quick let us join them  I will unfold my Banner to the Sun  And pour my Vengeance on this ParentFoe  LEICESTER  Well said but I must cool this burning Vein  Or this mad Youth will hurry us to Ruin  Aside  I meant not this I pray your Grace be calm  P HENRY  Yes as the Sea that quarrels with the Wind  Who is't can tame the hungry Panther's Rage  Glory has still an Appetite more keen  HARRY contends not for a vulgar Prize  It is a Crown Repeat it to the Heavens  With the big Mouth of War It is a Crown  O you should rush like Lightning from my Presence  And boldly pluck it from the Tyrant's Brow  LEICESTER  Your Highness knows our Hearts and Duty yours  But Zeal thus premature were worse than Treason  Our growing Cause is yet too young to combat  With this tempestuous Time If Fortune bless  Our good Allies with Victory the Crown  Is yours by Cov'nant and your Right proclaim'd  By  Scotland  's King Till when lie we in secret  Like the unseen insinuating Flame  That creeps while it destroys Without this Caution  We are not safe an HourYour Father comes  And you're withdrawn from CourtHah how sounds that  P HENRY  As I love Honour I do fear him not  LEICESTER  NoBut the less Suspicion's baleful Blast  Breathes on our Counsel it takes Root the deeper  P HENRY  What wouldst thou urge me to  LEICESTER  Come come my Lord  You must yourself to Court to meet the King  And when he questions you of your Departure  Be you not too submissive nor too high  We can find Reasons plausible enough  Besides this Disaffectionasd'ye mark  The Treatment of your Motherthe foul Scandal  Of a licentious Palaceand the like  All Provocations gross And Sir of this  You shall be more advis'd anon  P HENRY  Say'st so  I thank thy PenetrationI was hot  But thou art wise and brave This Craft shall prosper  The staunchest Hound of State that ever trac'd  The wily Doublings of Conspiracy  In this same Chace shall lose his baffled Scent  And yelp his balk'd Sagacity in Air  LEICESTER  May Fortune say Amen  P HENRY  My Lord of LEICESTER  We must dispatch some fresh Instructions strait  For  Scotland  's King then for the Court away  We will pursue this Business come what may  Exeunt  SCENE II  Enter the Earl of  SALISBURY  and Lord  CLIFFORD  SALISBURY  Yet hold good CLIFFORD  CLIFFORD  'Tis an old Man's Weakness  Was it not I that train'd him up to War  That taught his feeble Arm to grasp the Sword  And pointed out the Paths that lead to Glory  Was it for this he robb'd me of my Daughter  SALISBURY  Forget it learn to scorn this Royal Robber  And be at Peace  CLIFFORD  It is impossible  Had he reduc'd me to the Beggar's Lot  Or stript me of the Honours of my Race  I could have smil'd at his Ingratitude  But to deprive me of my greatest Hopes  To steal away my choicest sweetest Flower  To tempt young Innocence with hellish Arts  'Tis more than Painit iswhat is it not  O 'tis too much for an old Man to bear  But canst assure me he returns so soon  SALISBURY  Each Morn expects to see him crown'd with Laurels  And rich with Spoils Fortune still takes his Part  Wheree'er he marches palefac'd Terror stalks  With Giant Strides and leads his Van of Battle  CLIFFORD  Let me do Justice to the Man has wrong'd me  My Lord of SALISBURY from his Dawn of Youth  I trac'd the Symptoms of an active Soul  Suited for warlike Deeds and brave Atchievements  But then his turbulent Passions work so strong  His Character is ever an Extreme  A Hero or a Dotard in Excess  This Day with a deep Sense of Honour stung  HalfConvert to fair Virtue and the next  Born by fierce Appetite a Slave to Vice  SALISBURY  His gen'rous Temper one Day may prevail  For Fate still throws Occasion in his Way  To put his noble Qualities to Proof  An unexpected Tempest from the North  Hangs low'ring o'er his Head and the young Prince  Who breathes a mighty and right Royal Spirit  Has with some noble Followers left the Court  CLIFFORD  He is ensnar'd by guileful LEICESTER'S Art  The King thou know'st hath banish'd him his Presence  He meditates Revenge in all its Venom  And since arose the League 'twixt him and HARRY  SALISBURY  Report has said this Lord on Terms of Honour  Woo'd your fair Daughter's Love  CLIFFORD  He did profess so  But much I fear me with a vile Design  And for full Satisfaction but this Day  I've penn'd a Note in female Characters  As from my Daughter full of Blandishments  And cordial Invitations from her Love  If I surprise him at the Place assign'd  I shall detect his Baseness to his Face  Perhaps I but transcribe the Sentiments  Of her abandon'd Heartthat as it may  SALISBURY  Think not too meanly of thy beauteous Daughter  HENRY 'tis true engrosses all her Soul  Yet in her lonely solitary Hours  Sad she regrets her ruin'd Innocence  And mourns like the first Fair her fallen State  CLIFFORD  'Tis superficial Grief a barren Soil  Where Reformation never can take Root  O that an only Child should be a Curse  But let us hence the Thought encroaches on me  In Pity to myself I would divert it  Cousin this Way I have yet more to tell you  Of what my Soul is purpos'd tow'ard the King  Exeunt  SCENE III  Enter  ROSAMOND  and  HARRIANA  HARRIANA  This Coolness is untimely  ROSAMOND  HARRIANA  Th' unpleasing Thought will sometimes steal upon me  Great as they seem all these are dearbought Pleasures  Ev'n HENRY'S Love has cost me many a Pang  Peace is the glorious Privilege of Virtue  The harmless Country Maid that lives retir'd  Beneath the Covert of a homely Hut  And knows no View beyond her daily Bread  Has more Heart's Ease than I  HARRIANA  Prepost'rous Melancholy  Is not the World and its first Master yours  Nature thy Handmaid still supplies thy Wishes  Lavish of all her Stock as who should say  Thou shalt be happy  ROSAMOND  These are mean Suggestions  Know I ne'er sold my Virtue but to Love  The massy Store of the Wealthpregnant Earth  The Pomp and Eyeattracting Blaze of Courts  And all the gilded Baits of Female Pride  Were Bribes my HENRY'S Love disdain'd to offer  Such as it is this Beauty won his Heart  How he won mineI know notbut he won it  For him I threw away my Innocence  And am the Scoff of every scornful Tongue  For him I've stain'd the noble Name of CLIFFORD  And pierc'd his aged Soul who gave me Being  For him e'en now my Heart with Transport beats  His Presence ever calms my troubled Breast  Stills each dull Thought and bids all Sorrow vanish  HARRIANA  Once more he comes victorious from the Field  O meet him with thy Love's sincerest Welcome  ROSAMOND  Yes he returns and Thought adieu for ever  Hence I defy that Tyrant of the Mind  My Love wants not a Plea HENRY my Lord  Is great and gen'rous He's the Pride of Fame  And Fortune's Darling HENRY lulls my Soul  In soft unfelt Captivity  HARRIANA  But hark  Yon Trumpet's Voice proclaims him near at hand  ROSAMOND  O sweetest Music to my ravish'd Ear  Now ev'ry thing begins to smile about me  Bright seems the Season as the newborn Spring  When every Flower put forth its earliest Fragrance  And infant Nature breath'd her Sweets around  HARRIANA  'Tis now thou risest to thy proper Self  Thy Charms are summon'd all thy Graces dawn  And ev'ry sparkling Beauty beams anew  But lo the Royal HeroI retire  Exit  HARRIANA  Enter King  HENRY  K  HENRY  Take me once more my Love into thy Arms  Thus let me clasp thee to my faithful Breast  Thus feed my Eyes upon thy glowing Beauties  And pour my Soul in Transports out before thee  What what is Fame or Victory to this  Adieu the Pomp and Pageantry of War  And Love resume the Empire of my Soul  ROSAMOND  Speak not my Eyes the Language of my Heart  Or shall I open my rich Hoard of Fondness  With all the soft Impertinence of Love  Why has my Lord so long been absent from me  Methinks I now receive thee in thy Tent  Dreadfully graceful from the Field of Blood  The manly Dew still reeking on thy Brow  O let me sooth my Hero to his Rest  Then kindly chide his Eagerness of Valour  And bid him sheath the Sword for Love of me  K  HENRY  To thee I am devoted from this Hour  I'll give Mankind my loose superfluous Moments  But Love shall claim my more substantial Care  No petty Monarchs shall divide us more  France  and her King have felt the Wrath of HARRY  I flew on Wings of Victory to War  And like celestial Fire consum'd the Foe  Then halted in the mid Career of Glory  Conquest was Waste of Time Quick I return'd  And left the Business of the World unfinish'd  ROSAMOND  Forgive me HENRY if I shed a Tear  A Tear at once of Pity and of Love  Gaze not thus fondly on me whilst I speak  It is a fatal Fondness and betrays thee  Possess'd of me art thou not lost to Honour  Where is the native Greatness of thy Soul  Thy gen'rous Thirst of everlasting Glory  O hadst thou never fix'd thine Eyes on me  Fame  on her brazen Tablet had display'd  Thy Royal Name and shewn it to the Stars  But I shall blot thy Memory for ever  K  HENRY  Thy kind Concern is far too nice my Love  O ROSAMOND 'tis but the Dream of Pride  Kings and their Subjects all are Nature's Children  And ermin'd Greatness on the Throne must own it  What is the Monarch more than other Men  His Appetites and Passions are the same  He hates revenges hopes and fears as they do  Or does he love O does he love like me  'Tis Glory 'tis Ambition to pursue  The heav'nly Fair and win her to his Wishes  Is it not Pride to hang upon thy Smiles  Is it not Triumph to enfold thee thus  Art thou not All and is not this World Nothing  ROSAMOND  I could for ever listen to thy Voice  Whene'er thou speak'st Reason gives up the Cause  And Nature whispers what thou say'st is right  K  HENRY  Be Love the Theme and I could talk for ever  ROSAMOND  Be Love the Theme I could for ever hear thee  K  HENRY  O come my rural Goddess to my Arms  We'll lie upon the Flow'renamell'd Turf  The GarlandWreath shall be our Diadem  The Leafclad Bow'r our Canopy of State  Our Music the sweet Matin of the Lark  Then bless me with the Sunshine of thy Beauty  Till I forget my Royal Occupation  The Task of Greatness and the Toil of Power  And ev'ry Sense be full of Love and thee  ROSAMOND  How does thy Language charm my list'ning Ears  Yet must I dread this Indolence of Thought  The  Scotchmen  and their King are up in Arms  And if Report say true th' Invasion boasts  The Countenance of your Son  K  HENRY  Fear not my Love  My better Genius shall protect me still  Lend me thy LipDanger seems nothing now  O lead me to some peaceful close Retreat  Where all is calm and gentle as thy Breast  Let hostile War advance and Faction rage  I will not deign to give Mankind a Look  But safely rest within thy faithful Arms  So when the Pilgrim views the Storm arise  To the kind Shelter of some Grot he flies  And in that sweet Recess securely lies  Fearless he hears the dreadful Tempests roar  And madding Ocean bursting on the Shore  The Heav'ns in vain their flaming Terrors spread  And Thunders roll unheeded o'er his Head  Exeunt  The End of the  FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  Enter King  HENRY  Duke of  CORNWALL  and Attendants  K  HENRY  COMES on our Brother  Scotland  CORNWALL  Yes my Liege  He means to give my Lord of  Chester  Battle  K  HENRY  Be't so Our Arms shall tame his Insolence  Where is our Son His uncurb'd Spirit of late  Gives Cause of some Suspicion Yet we hope  In humble wise he will confess the Fault  Of his abrupt Departure His new Friends  No Friends to me tho' Foes I fear them not  He must abandon and mean time we trust  A Look of our Displeasure shall controul  His heedless Folly and enforce his Duty  CORNWALL  My Liege the Queen  K  HENRY  I would have shunn'd her for she awes my Soul  I know her still a tender faithful Wife  Wrong'd as she is 'Tis my eternal Guilt  That love I cannot where I must esteem  She comesWhy starts my BreastI must assume  The cruel Port of Shameproof Villainy  Enter  QUEEN  Excuse my Freedom Madam if I ask  What Business has the Queen of  England  here  QUEEN  I come by virtue of a better Title  Was ELINOR no more than Queen of  England  She had not thus disturb'd you with her Presence  Am I nought else my Lord  K  HENRY  Ay thou'rt my Wife  A Name that sounds offensive in my Ear  QUEEN  Why didst thou teach me 'twas a pleasing Name  Importing Peace and Harmony and Joy  You lov'd me when you made me what I am  And yet you lov'd me but to make me wretched  K  HENRY  Love you have learnt and so all Women can  Didst thou e'er learn Obedience to a Husband  QUEEN  Can Malice say I ever fail'd in that  K  HENRY  I pr'ythee then be dutiful and leave me  QUEEN  This Treatment is unkind Is that the Voice  That oft hath chid me for a Moment's Absence  Does it displease thee to behold me thus  Blame not the Weakness which yourself have caus'd  'Tis Grief's allow'd Prerogative to mourn  For sure it is no Crime to be distress'd  K  HENRY  Away Thy Woman's Tears are lost on me  Why dost thou plead against Necessity  It was in Spite of me I lov'd thee once  And 'twas in Spite of me that I forsook thee  The Tie of Marriage is but personal  For Love alone's the Cement of the Heart  Yet grant that Contract good my Falshood voids it  I am no Husband Why art thou a Wife  The Bond is cancell'd Be as free as I am  And take thy Heart from this ungrateful Object  QUEEN  Can the swift Current to its Spring recede  Or elemental Fire to Earth descend  Then only my fixt Thought can turn from thee  My Love tho' ill repaid shall shine a Pattern  Of Faith unmov'd without Reproach for ever  HENRY tho' cruel yet is HENRY still  What was it but my Love that sent me hither  I thought I durst not comebut still I came  Unwelcom'd slighted Stranger as I am  K  HENRY  I see thy Virtue and respect it ELINOR  But what is Virtue in the Eye of Love  Fate wrongly join'd us and mismatch'd our Hearts  Thou art fram'd tender innocent and good  For private Comfort and domestic Joy  My restless Spirit ranges uncontroul'd  As Fancy sways or lawless Passion guides  QUEEN  And yet thou canst be true tho' not to me  That restless Spirit ROSAMOND can rule  The Mistress of my Property thy Heart  Throw that detested Wanton from thy Breast  The Pride of Woman's Nature sues for this  O do not wrong me in the Face of Day  And I will bear thy Hate with Chearfulness  K  HENRY  Thou hast the Licence of an injur'd Wife  And 'tis a Woman's Privilege to rail  Else let me tell thee ELINOR 'twere Treason  What thou hast just now said  QUEEN  I ask your Pardon  I had forgot how dearly HENRY loves her  And 'tis my Duty to promote his Joy  Nor justly can I hate ev'n her my Rival  Woman is frail and HENRY more than Man  Be happy then blest Pair while I'm undone  A jealous Wife no more shall spoil your Loves  I will not taint your Peace with one Upbraiding  But lay me down without a Groan and die  K  HENRY  This Tenderness reproaches me yet more  Than all the just Invectives thou couldst offer  O live to scorn the Man has wrong'd thee thus  Provoke I not thy utmost Enmity  QUEEN  Thou canst provoke my Sorrows not my Hate  K  HENRY  Have I not giv'n thee Cause Be but my Foe  I shall enjoy the Sharpness of thy Malice  But Goodness undeserv'd unask'd torments me  Love Honour Pity tear my lab'ring Soul  Aside  QUEEN  Life had been happy with theeBut 'tis past  And I submitLive and be happy thou  K  HENRY  By Heav'n this moves my Stubbornness of Temper  And ROSAMOND and ELINOR distract me  Must I then ruin one whom Laws divine  And my free Choice decreed mine own for ever  And coolly mark her close her Eyes in Death  Or can I leave the gentle ROSAMOND  That tender Prime of Youth that Spring of Beauty  First won by Promise of eternal Love  Painful Extreme of Madness either Way  For either Way I'm doom'd to be a Villain  QUEEN  Seek not Excuses for thy broken Vows  I freely give those sacred Pledges back  Nor shall I e'er ascribe the Pangs I suffer  To HENRY'S Crime but Heav'n's afflicting Hand  I know thee great and noble still by Nature  Thou wilt hereafter reverence my Name  And praise the Woman whom thou could'st not love  K  HENRY  O Heart Heart Heart why art thou not my own  Hadst thou attack'd me like a Fiend from Hell  Arm'd with keen Malice and severest Wrath  I had not shunn'd the Conflict But as now  Thou shinest Angellike and allforgiving  Thou dost perforce convict my guilty Soul  And sink my Thoughts in black Despair for ever  O ELINOR my QueenBut soft some News  Enter  GUARD  My Liege the young Prince HENRY waits without  And asks Admission to your Majesty  K  HENRY  He comes in proper Time Let him advance  Enter Prince  HENRY  Well thou young ManWith what a lordly Look  Thou mak'st ApproachDost thou not know me HARRY  P  HENRY  Yes Sir you are my Father and my King  Names sacred both But still more sacred those  Of Faith and Honour these are what enroll  The Monarch's Name in Glory's noble List  And stamp substantial Royalty upon him  Th' Imperial Robe the brightdeck'd Diadem  The lifted Brow the Worldcommanding Nod  Ay and the loudtongu'd Voice of Acclamation  That bears up frail Mortality to Heav'n  These all are Majesty's Appendages  The Dress but not the Substance that disgrace  The Undeserver and but lift him high  To a Preeminence of splendid Shame  K  HENRY  What art thou come to preach to us thou Boy  Are these th' obsequious Terms of filial Duty  But mark I henceforth warn thee to Obedience  And therefore satisfy our Royal Pleasure  Why thou didst leave the Court  P  HENRY  That's a plain Question  My Mother could have answer'd  K  HENRY  Hah our Queen  Thou seem'st surpris'd Is that a Face of Guilt  Speak speak for my shock'd Soul has form'd a Thought  Too black for Utt'rance  QUEEN  By my Hopes of Heav'n  For there perhaps I shall at last have Peace  I only know that I am innocent  P  HENRY  I know no more than that and that's enough  Shall I beseech awhile your Royal Ear  To give me patient Audience  K  HENRY  Well I'll hear thee  P  HENRY  Did HENRY leave the Court Not so my Liege  For HENRY left a Brothel not a Court  Loose Riot and Intemperance dwelt there  Softseated Indolence and Female Foppery  And pamper'd Jollity with fullblown Cheeks  Keeping high Festival and Jubilee  Was it for me to trust my Spring of Youth  That takes Impression like the yielding Wax  With such licentious Characters as these  Was it for me to sink in Luxury  To see a dimpled Harlot's wanton Reign  While banish'd from your House your Board your Bed  The best of Women languish'd Time away  At once a Widow and at once a Wife  I saw her Griefs I heard her just Complaints  I left by her Advice th'unhallow'd Roof  Lest I should seem to abet the Injury  And triumph o'er the Woes of her that bore me  K  HENRY  Woman has not her Match on this Side Hell  Fool to believe a scorn'd abandon'd Wife  Less subtle or malicious than the Devil  Is this the praying dying ELINOR  Curse on thy fawning Honeysteep'd Deceit  What dost Thou practise with my secret Foes  In dev'lish League Dost Thou foment Rebellion  Say Woman dost thou  QUEEN  What shall I say  Wilt thou thou rash hardhearted Youth undo me  Revoke the impious Slander of thy Tongue  And save thy Mother's Name from foul Dishonour  K  HENRY  It is too lateI see confed'rate Mischief  This stripling Traytor has betray'd thy Counsel  Thee I had long since hated now despise  For you our sometime Son but that I scorn  To waste a Thought upon thee I could humble  That lofty Spirit till its fallen Crest  Should crouch and offer Homage to the Dust  But Majesty is fenc'd with Adamant  Proof against Treason's Darts that but recoil  And mock the Force that threw themIt is thus  The Ocean does but fret upon the Strand  And the Storm breathes against the deepbas'd Tow'r  QUEEN  Will it avail me to appeal to Heav'n  O may its choicest Stores of Wrath consume me  If e'er in Word or Thought I urg'd this Variance  He has abus'd thee with a wellfeign'd Tale  Screening some dreadful Purpose  K  HENRY  Peace I say  You've fool'd me once and would you make me mad  Hah who shall tame me then By Heav'n if Thought  But halts a Moment in Suspense to doubt thee  Fullsated Sense rebukes it  QUEEN  O my Son  The Pain thou gav'st me once was Ease to this  Why was thy Birthday hail'd with general Joy  Why did I bless the Sun that saw thee first  Why did I fondly rear thy feeble Age  Is thy Heart Flint O yet unweave thy Craft  Ere the sad Scheme be ratify'd above  And Fate has sign'd the Warrant  P  HENRY  Let not these Fearindited Words deceive  The King while on my Knee I call to witness  The guardian Pow'rs that shield the Lives of Princes  That not in pers'nal Pique or private Grudge  Or Peevishness of Appetite restrain'd

meant more  P  HENRY  Abuse fairspoken Honour and e'en Love  Becomes a Malecontent  K  HENRY  Damn'd Hypocrites  Ye Homebred Plagues ye vile intestine Mischiefs  O had Rebellion bellow'd in the Field  And boldly challeng'd forth the Lord's Anointed  I could have calmly met its hottest Battle  But to reflect on unsuspected Treason  Most unsuspected as unnatural  Spreading its Poison ev'n within my Walls  Insulting in the sacred Name of Justice▪  Or stabbing with the smiling Look of Love  This grinds my ThoughtNow let Confusion reign  All Order and Relation be dissolv'd  And thou O Nature turn aside thy Face  Crimson'd with BlushesAll my firm Resolves  Are brittle now and Patience turns a Fury  Who's there Our Loving Wife and Loyal Son  QUEEN  Thy loving Wife but most disloyal Son  To me and thee Let me appeal my Lord  To the fair Judgment of your former Love  Did I not ever make your Will my Law  Was I deceitful treach'rous artful then  'Tis true my Wrongs are great but sure no Wrongs  Can alter Nature or invert the Mind  My Wrongs call for Revenge but sure a Queen  Could well revenge a nobler Way than this  O take my All my Liberty my Life  But leave me leave me my good Name untainted  K  HENRY  Woman no more Have I not heard thy Son  QUEEN  He is no Son of mine  P  HENRY  What would the Queen  So poorly yield her well▪contested Right  I know thy Cause and know my Duty better  QUEEN  Take heed ere yet an injur'd Mother's Curse  Fix on thy Bloom of Youth  P  HENRY  Her Grief distracts her  Yet let me quit my Honour to the King  Wherein is my Complaint unwarrantable  Is it Rebellion Sir to sue for Justice  Which the poor Country Hind if he but lose  His starveling Scrap of Property demands  Is this deny'd your Son Be the King sure  I know my Right and knowing dare maintain it  K  HENRY  Thou hast no Right to move to speak to breathe  But with our Royal Licence Cease thou Fool  To parly with our high Authority  Thy trait'rous Friends have poison'd thy young Ear  HARRY I know them well But mark I charge thee  Forsake for ever all that Vermin Tribe  Or know their rotten Counsels will undo thee  P  HENRY  Forsake my Friends Hear me allconscious Heav'n  While I renounce the base unmanly Thought  Forbid it Justice and forbid it Honour  Not one of them but lives in my best Love  Dear as the vital Stream that warms my Heart  Great are their Virtues and their Persons sacred  Let the whole World be told my Life protects them  And here I swear not all the Pow'rs combin'd  Of Earth or Hell shall drive me from this Purpose  K  HENRY  Hah Didst thou ever see thy King in Wrath  If my large Weight of Vengeance fall upon thee  'Twill crush thee like an Insect into Dust  What am I brav'd by thee Shall HENRY walk  Within the scanty Sphere of thy Prescription  Fame stop thy Mouth nor be it known abroad  That He whose wide Circumference of Sway  In its vast Fold embraces Nations round  Was tutor'd by a Boy Droop thy Head Greatness  If Striplings shall give Law to Pow'r like mine  Be wise in Time and know young Counsellor  Our Wisdom pities thy raw Youth but learn  More low Demeanour or thou'lt fire my Blood  And damn thyself

your Offspring  Shall I be frighted when an old Man storms  Or fear a peevish Father in my Foe  Let Majesty shine forth in all its Pow'r  I dare unmov'd behold its fiercest Blaze  And like an Eagle

die  Perish for him for whom alone I liv'd  And selfacquitted leave the World in Peace  The watchful Eye of Providence that sees  Thro' Night's most sable Shade and well discerns  Each dark Intrigue each Crevice of the Heart  Shall one Day vindicate my Innocence  And crown my injur'd Love with Praise immortal  Then when I'm laid in Dust my cruel Lord  O'er my cold Grave shall shed a pitying Tear  And own I well deserv'd a happier Fate  Exit  SCENE II  Enter King  HENRY  and  ROSAMOND  ROSAMOND  And will you go  K  HENRY  But for this Night my Fair  ROSAMOND  This Night how many Hours are in this Night  How many Minutes in each tedious Hour  Methinks I dare not trust thee from my Arms  K  HENRY  Thou know'st my Love the solemn Vow I made  I must do Penance at the sacred Shrine  Of  Becket  ere I close mine Eyes in Sleep  The Holy Father of the Church injoin'd it  If I refuse I draw upon mine Head  Curses Anathemas and Execrations  And all th' Artillery of angry Priesthood  This once perform'd I am thy own for ever  ROSAMOND  O let my Lord excuse my selfish Fears  For what is HENRY'S Safety but my own  K  HENRY  Why we shall live to triumph over both  This Traitress Queen and fierce hotheaded Son  But I forget them while I view thy Beauty  Sole Comfort adequate to kingly Care  The soothing Freshness of the vernal Breeze  The lulling Notes of dying Harmony  The rapt'rous Calm of good Mens golden Dreams  Bring not such balmy Quiet to the Soul  As thy Sensestealing Softness  ROSAMOND  Can my Love  Stray but a Moment ev'n in Thought from thee  Joy of my Life and Sov'reign of my Wishes  Such Sighs as these within your Bosom heav'd  Such lively Fondness sparkled in your Eyes  Such tuneful Accents trembled on your Tongue  When first transported at my Feet you sigh'd  My Royal Captive and there swore you lov'd  K  HENRY  Thy Charms had caught me but some Days before  Let me look back on that delightful Hour  'Twas in an Ev'ning of the blooming  May  The Nymphs and Swains in rural Garb attir'd  To the Pipe's woodland Strain upon the Lawn  In mirthful Freedom join'd the sprightly Dance  You shone superior 'midst the Virgin Throng  Fairest among the Fair Auspicious Fortune  Had led my Steps that Way I came I saw  And seeing lov'd  ROSAMOND  Love like a watchful Spy surpris'd my Heart  Wellfitted to receive the soft Impression  Thy graceful Presence drew my wond'ring Eyes  I sigh'd but knew not 'twas a Sigh of Love  I wept but knew not that I wept for thee  Till Nature by degrees inform'd my Heart  And something told me I was made for you  K  HENRY  For me for me alone those heav'nly Charms  Had been dishonour'd by inferior Love  Nature design'd thee for the noblest Conquest  And giving thee such Excellence of Beauty  Wisely contriv'd a Blessing for a Monarch  ROSAMOND  And of all Monarchs only for my HENRY  Who shines distinguish'd 'midst a Tribe of Kings  As they among the vulgar Herd  K  HENRY  Enough  Be it my Glory to deserve thy Sweetness  ROSAMOND  Be it my Glory to repay thy Truth  K  HENRY  How strong the Tie which Love himself has made  One dear Embrace and for this Night adieu  ROSAMOND  I grudge ev'n Saints a Moment of thy Time  How shall I sigh and languish in thy Absence  How shall I spring to hail thy safe Return  With a fond Heart fullfraught with Love and Joy  So the poor Bird sits pensive in her Nest  While tender Fears disturb her anxious Breast  At length she kens her Mate with piercing Eye  On rapid Pinions skim along the Sky  With welcome Notes she chears the vocal Grove  And fondly chirps and bills with most officious Love  Exeunt  The End of the  SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE I  Enter Lord  CLIFFORD  in Disguise  HENRY must pass this Way for BECKET'S Tomb  While thus attir'd like a poor begging Friar  I shall escape his Knowlege▪ I must win  His Ear to my Discourse while I relate  The piteous Story of my Sufferings  And circumstantially describe my Woes  In Terms so clear that the Similitude  Himself portraiting strongly to himself  Shall strike upon his Soul With a dim Eye  Personal Guilt is view'd an Atom Spot  Sharpsighted Censure sees in other Men  What tho' our barren Conf'rence have no Issue  At least I shall unload my burden'd Heart  And probe his wounded Conscience to the Quick  But holdHe comes  Enter King  HENRY  K  HENRY  'Tis muchWhat to submit  To painful Chastisement and on the Flint  Wear out the slowpac'd NightBe we content  'Tis to appease our holy Mother Church  I like this Cloister's awful Solitude  It seems the Dwellingplace of Meditation  Hah who comes tow'rds us with so sad an Aspect  Sure he's the youngest Son of Misery  Lo here a Beggar and a King Wide Contrast  Yet pass one Moment all Distinctions vanish  And Majesty incorporates with Dust  Let Pride go weep It may amuse my Thought  To hide the King and commune with this Fellow  What hoa Friend who are you  CLIFFORD  Why who art thou  That dost not know LORENZO the poor Friar  K  HENRY  I'm come to pay Devotion to Saint THOMAS  And am a Stranger here  CLIFFORD  I crave your Pardon  Thou seem'st of noble Blood  K  HENRY  Well hast thou said  For such I am  CLIFFORD  Then Sir you know King HENRY  K  HENRY  Exceeding well I oft attend his Court  But why's thy Tongue familiar with that Name  CLIFFORD  Because I take a Pride to let thee know  That wretched as I am this Arm has serv'd him  K  HENRY  If well I trust that Service was repaid  CLIFFORD  As Avarice could wish Ev'n to this Day  He is the Idol of my Memory  I serv'd him in his early Prime of Glory  His Soldiers lov'd him all for all believ'd him  The best of Kings his Country's Friend and Father  O he was noble gen'rous brave and just  Pow'rful but to protect and not oppress  Fear'd and renown'd abroad and lov'd at Home  K  HENRY  Praise undeserv'd is Satire's bitt'rest Gall  Aside  In Faith thou hast describ'd his Highness well  Methinks there is right Honesty about thee  Thy Talk exceeds the Promise of that Habit  CLIFFORD  Sir I was once no Stranger to good Fortune  But wherefore do I hold this Talk Farewel  K  HENRY  Yet stay for thou hast mov'd my Soul to learn  The wretched Circumstances of thy Life  Why is thy Look thus sad and discontented  Does not Religion's Garb sit easy on thee  Say wherefore didst thou leave the Royal Camp  To live immur'd within these holy Walls  Yet now unmindful of thy Dedication  Dost nauseate the Cup of Poverty  Thyself hast sworn to drink  CLIFFORD  Thou dost not know  What 'tis to be distress'dI could display  A Scene so mournful to thy startled Ear  Thy Wonder should be swallow'd up in Pity  Canst thou lend Patience to an old Man's Prattle  K  HENRY  I will  CLIFFORD  Know then the holy Brotherhood  Combat with more in this religious Warfare  Than Downreposing Luxury e'er dreamt of  We're Men but yet no Members of Mankind  This Monastery is to us our World  Yon melancholy Cells thou seest our Home  There ev'ry Night in pensive Meditation  We watch the Lamp's dull Gleam and when we sleep  'Tis but what Nature steals from rigid Duty  Till the shrill Cock the Usher of the Morn  Awakes us to the Discipline of Day  Our homely Meals are low and regular  And while we stay the Rage of Appetite  We starve the dainty Palate To be brief  Wealth Business Pleasure Honour we renounce  And all of us are Wretches by Engagement  'Tis thus we struggle with Mortality  Rather than live What think you of our State  K  HENRY  'Tis all that Man can do tow'rds earning Heav'n  It is Extremity of Wretchedness  But yet  CLIFFORD  Ha ha ha  K  HENRY  What can provoke thy Mirth  CLIFFORD  Your Ignorance  For in this Light thou seest me to Advantage  All this is Happiness to what I suffer  Was this the mighty Sum of all my Sorrow  These Eyes should start in Transport from their Orbs  And my old Heartstrings crack with rising Joy  K  HENRY  Thy Fortune has been merciless indeed  If this sad Place be Sorrow's Sanctuary  CLIFFORD  What's this Sir to the Poignancy of Woe  To inward Grief to vital Agony  And the keen Pang that gnaws upon the Heart  Poor tho' he is the Man whose Mind's at Ease  Beneath the Strawbuilt Roof enjoys his Sleep  At pinching Hunger's Importunity  Epicurelike devours his savoury Scrap  And joyous as the brainsick Reveller  Quaffs down the unadulterated Stream  But O how bitter is the scanty Morsel  That feeding Life but nourishes Despair  K  HENRY  How loudly does the Voice of Grief demand  The social Tear O what is mortal Man  That may be brought thus low 'Twill glad my Soul  To make this Fellow happy  Aside  CLIFFORD  Stranger I thank thy Tears they shew thee noble  Pity flows always from the manly Heart  Have you a Daughter Sir  K  HENRY  Say why that Question  CLIFFORD  O I had one so fair so innocent  Excuse my Tears  K  HENRY  Thou seem'st to speak of her  In pleasing TermsSo fair so innocent  CLIFFORD  O she was once the Treasure of my Soul  Bright as the Morning's freshexpanded Beam▪  And spotless as the whiterob'd Angels are  Whene'er I taught her Honour's sacred Law  Her still Attention and obsequious Look  Seem'd the Certificates of inborn Virtue  Sometimes I've trac'd her Mother in her Face  Pleas'd to recall the Springtide of my Days  And travel o'er Youth's chearful Road again  For her I left the Business of the Field  Wellpleas'd I toil'd a rural Life away  And joyful saw my golden Harvests rise  But Plenty Peace and Comfort are no more  Her coward Virtue stoop'd to brutal Love  I could not bear the Shame I left my House  The Fugitive of Choice and not of Fortune  Sick of this worthless World at length I sought  This Cloister of religious Poverty  And here I mean to lay down Life and Sorrow  K  HENRY  Thy Loftiness of Soul amazes me  Who was the Villain that abus'd thy Daughter  Perdition on his Head  CLIFFORD  That cuts me deep  My most invet'rate Foe had spar'd my Fame  But him that ruin'd it I call'd my Friend  He was the Man I honour'd from my Soul  I thought him honest noble just and true  But found him treach'rous wicked false and base  K  HENRY  What means my Heart Thou hadst a Daughter CLIFFORD  Aside  CLIFFORD  My hospitable Doors had just receiv'd him  A welcome Guest a smiling Murderer  While Confidence in his superior Worth  Made the curst Work of my Undoing easy  K  HENRY  The Dagger's Point the Scorpion's deadly Bite  Wound not like these Soulpenetrating Words  I'm like this very Villain  Aside  CLIFFORD  You're disturb'd Sir  K  HENRY  No not at all Proceed you in your Tale  CLIFFORD  To this Ingratitude he added more  I had been Guardian to his tender Youth  And for I found a warlike Spirit in him  Train'd him to hard Fatigues and manly Toil  We serv'd together in the Wars abroad  And I was still his Pattern in the Battle  Fame has since then spoke loudly in his Praise  But be he e'er so great I made him so  K  HENRY  I stand condemn'dit isit cannot be  Sure he's a Messenger from angry Heav'n  Sent to arraign my Soul  Aside  CLIFFORD  Are you well Sir  K  HENRY  A sudden Qualm has seiz'd me But 'twill off  'Tis a familiar MaladyAccept  These AlmsI must be goneAgain tomorrow  CLIFFORD  But one Word more something remains untold  He further ow'd a nearer Obligation  To my Heart's Love For once in Heat of Fight  When he had broke his Sword the desp'rate Foe  With his broad Falchion aiming at his Head  Had levell'd him to Earth when I rush'd in  And disappointed Fate This wounded Breast  Bears yet the honest Record of that Service  Please you look here  K HENRY  Give me more Air Away  Exit  CLIFFORD  He has it deep I mark'd his startled Conscience  I drove the keen Reproach into his Heart  He shook like a raw Novice in his Guilt  May Heav'n indent th' Impression on his Soul  This is a busy Ev'ning at this Hour  And near this Place my Letter did appoint  The Earl of LEICESTER to an Interview  I am no more a Beggar in Disguise  But here an open and avenging Foe  Exit  SCENE II  Enter  QUEEN  and Duke of  CORNWALL  QUEEN  Thou hast well flatter'd my desponding Soul  That had forgot to hope O Pain of Doubt  Next to Despair  CORNWALL  Let not the QUEEN distrust  These Means of good Success I've wish'd long since  T' assist thy Exigence and but just now  Consulted sev'rally the Royal Guard  That keep the Watch Tonight at her Apartment  I've won them to your Int'rest on Condition  No Wrong be offer'd to the Fairone's Person  At Midnight's silent Hour nought will obstruct  The fatal Visitation  QUEEN  My good Lord  I thank thy Friendship by my Hopes of Peace  The Person of my Rival shall be sacred  'Twill pain me to dissemble Cruelty  For I have all the Softness of my Sex  But no Resentment jealous Rage and Malice  That wont t'inflame the Breast of injur'd Woman  CORNWALL  Hard by yon Hill where now the Lamp of Day  Seaward descends there stands a fam'd old Convent  Ne'er had Religion a more awful Mansion  A Stream slowgliding winds about its Borders  Upon whose Banks stands a long Range of Oaks  That cast a wide Solemnity of Shade  O'er the high Walls the creeping Ivy climbs  And in its higharch'd Vaults no Sounds are heard  But whistling Winds and deepton'd Falls of Water  Remorse and Horror dwell for ever there  It is the Seat of Penitence and Sorrow  Thither be ROSAMOND this Night convey'd  And for the rest trust Heav'n  QUEEN  This may secure  My wretched Rival but the KING my Lord  How shall I face his Anger For I know  Alas I do not know how much he loves her  CORNWALL  Believe me ev'ry Circumstance shall end  In ample Illustration of thy Virtue  My Lord of CHESTER has o'erthrown the  Scots  So shall you soon stand clear of all Suspicion  Of aiding jointly with your Son the War  And injur'd Innocence again shall triumph  QUEEN  Good Omens dwell upon thy pleasing Words  But let us hence that I may teach my Heart  This Night's important Task  Exeunt  Enter Lord  LEICESTER  with a Letter  Fortune thou dost exceed thy Vot'ry's Hope  Fate does my Work herself and spares my Pains  How had my Brain been toiling for this Hour  She wills me meet her herethe gentle Dame  HARRY this once I give thee leave to rest  Night's Mantle dy'd in blackest  Erebus  Shroud thy unconscious ThoughtPause this blest Hour  The nobler Movements of my busy Soul  And let me stoop to Beauty's pleasing Lure  Thus the bold Bird of Prey the princely Vulture  Forgets a while his bloody Occupation  To hold an am'rous Parley with his Mate  Comes she orHahby Hell 'tis CLIFFORD'S Self  Unlucky Stars But Statesman to thy Work  Enter Lord  CLIFFORD  CLIFFORD  Good Even to my Lord You seem'd in Thought  LEICESTER  In Faith my good Lord CLIFFORD so I was  I have some certain Smatch of Poesy  And walking forth to taste the Ev'ning's Freshness  My Wit 'gan to be somewhat humoursome  I fear your Lordship has quite marr'd my Sonnet  CLIFFORD  What does the Paper you just folded up  Contain the Substance  LEICESTER  A short Sketch my Lord  My Muse in Miniature a very Trifle  CLIFFORD  Say LEICESTER is't a Time to trifle now  Peace to thy Heart I think the Season's sickly  LEICESTER  Why so do I and trust me noble CLIFFORD  'Tis but to cheat away my Melancholy  I sometimes condescend to be a Fool  CLIFFORD  O I could be a Fool or ev'n a Knave  Could rank me with the common savage Crew  Turn Hireling drudging Slave and carry Burdens  And feed on scanty Scraps with Dogs on Dunghils  If I could purchase with this Sum of Misery  My wonted Peace of Mind Sure I'm so wretched  Fate fix'd me for its Masterpiece of Malice  LEICESTER  Great are thy Wrongs indeed Yet we all suffer  'Tis epidemical this State Disorder  And who can cure the Fever but ourselves  We'll be our own Physicians my good Lord  And let out this hot Blood  CLIFFORD  I'm not so desp'rate in my Purposes  Headstrong Impatience swells beyond its Charter  And I must tell thee I've that Sense of Honour  That I could bear a Thousand gross Affronts  That stink ev'n to the Sun before the Guile  Of artful Villainy that lurks unseen  And ruins while it smiles  LEICESTER  Ev'n so good CLIFFORD  Sure a clandestine Traitor is the vilest  The Devil's most odious Quality is his Cunning  Let us not think your Lordship has such Foes  Mean time make use of me and my Soul's Friendship  CLIFFORD  Hah LEICESTER dost thou know what Friendship is  'Tis not the fawning Cringe the study'd Smile  The honeydropping Speech or solemn Vow  It is a sacred Ray of heav'nly Love  Like that rejoicing in the Good of others  It scorns the narrow Bounds of Selfishness  And knows no Bliss sincere but social Joy  Simple and plain it shines in naked Truth  And opens all the Sluices of the Heart  LEICESTER  What means all this  CLIFFORD  I know no double Meaning  LEICESTER  I thought I had been known and try'd enough  Not to be troubled with a pedant Lecture  Let me my Lord tell you another Truth  Distrust is Friendship's Canker  CLIFFORD  Then I fear me  Our Friendship waxes tow'rd a Dissolution  Because sometimes Distrust is kin to Prudence  LEICESTER  That as your Lordship thinks For my own Part  I know the Man will thank me for my Service  And so Goodnight  CLIFFORD  Nay hold you go not yet  For I have that to say will make your Heart sick  Before we part  LEICESTER  What dost thou mean old Dotard  Thee and thy peevish Menace I defy  CLIFFORD  Then I demand in Honour's sacred Name  As Thou would'st here make good thy Honesty  That thou unfold the Purport of that Paper  The Sonnet that thou talk'dst of  LEICESTER  Is my Quality  Sunk on a sudden to so low an Ebb  That I must answer every Fool's Demand  Which he may make because his Humour's testy  CLIFFORD  Then my Demand is fruitless is it not  LEICESTER  Ay and injurious too Thy Age protects thee  Else on this Side I wear an Advocate  This faithful Sword to guard its Master's Honour  And vindicate his Name from foulmouth'd Slander  CLIFFORD  Come thy Hypocrisy's a threadbare Cloak  You've worn it long▪ my Lord and now 'tis seen through  If thy Complexion were as black as Hell  I'd conjure up a Blush into thy Cheeks  Know then I sent that Scroll  LEICESTER  Know then I care not  CLIFFORD  O thou vile Spoiler  Wherein or when had I offended thee  That thou couldst calmly mean me so much Wrong  Lost as she is to HENRY'S damn'd Inchantments  My Daughter's not a gen'ral Prostitute  Or say she was the Plaything of Mankind  My Friend would spurn at her but pity me  LEICESTER  Thee and whatever else shall dare presume  To thwart my Pleasures I despise alike  That I am disappointed is most true  Love and fair ROSAMOND had fir'd my Hopes  But for the Venom of thy scurrilous Tongue  It hurts not me go rail against the Winds  My Heart is Adamant and feels it not  What dost thou here Dost thou dissemble too  By my balk'd Joys thou're Partner in the Trade  Thou sharest in the Spoil and standest here  The Pander of thy Daughter's fulsome Lust  CLIFFORD  HoldLet me waitfor Heav'n itself perhaps  Will take my Part and blast thee on the Spot  Or does it leave me to revenge myself  This trusty Sword that never yet unmask'd  But in the Field of Honour shall for once  Be stain'd in single Fight with Traitor's Blood  LEICESTER  Fortune and ROSAMOND but smile this Hour  And this shall be the Birthday of my Bliss  I draw the Sword of keenest Hate Come on  Fight  CLIFFORD  falls  CLIFFORD  LEICESTER the Glory and the Guilt is thine  That hast oppos'd thy Wrath to rev'rend Age  But Life was burdensomeand for this once  Ev'n Thou art kindI pity and forgive thee  O Heav'nHah who are these  Enter  OFFICER  and Guards  OFFICER  My Lord of LEICESTER  I arrest thee here in the King's Name for Treason  In holding Correspondence with the  Scots  Secure him GuardWhat's hereLord CLIFFORD fall'n  O cursed DeedHow fares it with your Lordship  CLIFFORD  Well art thou come to catch my parting Breath  For I perceive Compassion in thy Look  Bear my last Words to gentle SALISBURY  He shall report them where the Sound shall startle  And like the Voice of Heav'n command Attention  HENRY was once old CLIFFORD'S Royal Friend  And ROSAMOND was CLIFFORD'S only Daughter  But ROSAMOND and HENRY more than kill'd me  For O this mortal Wound is Titillation  To Honour's painful StabYet witness Friend  That in this calm this reconciling Hour  I steep all Passion in Forgetfulness  Warn them some Angel ere Heav'n's Wrath be ripe  To separate their fatal Loves for ever  That we may meet in Harmony above  Where Folly Grief and Pain shall be no more  So prays as for his Soul the dying CLIFFORD  Dies  OFFICER  Heav'n hear thy pious Wish thou good old Man  For you my Lord but for this last black Deed  That makes ev'n Pity callous I could grieve  To bid you be prepar'd to die Tomorrow  LEICESTER  It had been Cowardice to rush on Death  When Fate had other Mischiefs in Reserve  Else my own Hands had freed me from the World  And HENRY'S idle Spleen But let him know  I dare defy the utmost of his Power  Come Death come Hell I will be LEICESTER still  OFFICER  Far other Words in this Distress would better  LEICESTER  Away I was not born to know Distress  My Soul hightow'ring on her fullfledg'd Wing  And independent on Contingency  Hears Fortune's airspent Arrows hiss beneath her  Defeated I still boast in my vast Purpose  I play'd a dang'rous but a noble Game  'Twas Fortitude to venture Life for Glory  And next to that 'tis Fortitude to die  I have but one Request to makeyour Leave  To see the Prince  OFFICER  I have no Orders to refuse you that  LEICESTER  Yet for one Moment my tough Heart must bend  And Nature shock'd confess a transient Pang  The Dream of Bliss now swims before my Eyes  Fortune had plac'd my Happiness in View  And when I rush'd to grasp the solid Joy  She marr'd my Hopes and dash'd them to the Ground  The Merchant thus the wish'dfor Haven sees  And chears his Soul with Hopes of future Ease  But unforeseen the threat'ning Tempests rise  And Clouds blacklowring gather in the Skies  Winds roar Seas swell his shatter'd Bark is tost  And in a sudden Wreck his Mass of Wealth is lost  Exeunt  The End of the  THIRD ACT  ACT IV  SCENE I  Enter  QUEEN  Duke of  CORNWALL  and Guard  CORNWALL  THIS is the Way that leads to her Apartment  Fortune now bids thee triumph o'er thy Rival  QUEEN  Alas I know not how t' insult Misfortune  Yet must I act a haughty Rival's Part  Affect the high Disdain of Majesty  The Rage of Jealousy and Storm of Vengeance  Illsuited to my Tenderness of Nature  But soft Compassion dress'd in Terms of Hate  Will make more worth the Gift of forfeit Life  And justify my Name to future Times  CORNWALL  These shall be near to wait th' expected Call  Exeunt  ROSAMOND  sola  How dreadful 'tis to commune with one's self  It is Society that makes Sin pleasing  Leadpinion'd Slumber weighs upon the Sense  But wakeful Conscience knows no Hour of Rest  And the clos'd Eyelid cannot shut out Care  Why tarries HARRIANA But she comes  Hah I'm betray'dThe jealous angry Queen  And with her a grim Crew of Murderers  Earth open wide thy Bosom to receive me  Night shield me with impenetrable Darkness  Enter  QUEEN  Stand you without and wait our Word of Fate  Where is this impious and deluded Woman  Prepare prepare to meet my big Resentment  And satisfy the Vengeance of my Soul  ROSAMOND  Thus selfcondemn'd how shall I plead for Pardon  Or stand before offended Majesty  Yet Heav'n accepts in Part of due Atonement  Confession of the Crime Here on my Knees  QUEEN  Call'st thou it Merit to confess a Crime  Thou dar'st no more deny than vindicate  Strive not in vain to deprecate my Wrath  Think on the Anguish of an injur'd Wife  Think on the Torture of a slighted Lover  Think on the Hatred of a pow'rful Rival  Think on all these and think on Death  ROSAMOND  O rather  Think on the Horror of a Wretch that stands  Upon the Brink of Death but dares not die  My Soul is startled at the View of Death  And ev'ry Weakness takes the sad Alarm  QUEEN  Art thou afraid to die I'd have thee so  'Tis Joy to antedate thy Misery  To suff'ring Virtue Death's a Remedy  To Guilt like thine alone a Punishment  ROSAMOND  Great Queen relent and spare my Bloom of Youth  Compassion on Distress is great and noble  But undeserv'd 'tis godlike O remember  Mercy's the shining Attribute of Heav'n  'Twill sooth thee in thy last sad Hour to think  Thou didst not plunge me into endless Ruin  And when thou mountest to thy native Sky  Admiring Angels shall come crouding round thee  And own that thou of all the Race of Men  Hast copy'd best thy bright Original  QUEEN  Think not to whine me from my firm Resolve  Can a Sigh cool the Sun's meridian Blaze  Or a Tear quench the Rage of spreading Flames  Then may this Shew of artificial Grief  Of forc'd Remorse appease my angry Soul  ROSAMOND  'Tis not in Art to mimic Grief like mine  Let me conjure thee as thou art a Woman  By all the natural Softness of our Sex  Not in wild Haste to dye thy Hands in Blood  Much have I sinn'd indeed If Love's a Sin  That Sin in every Circumstance was Love  Who knows not female Passions lordly Rule  Impatient ever of cool Judgment's Sway  Disgrace Confusion Ruin Rage and Death  Are Arguments to Reason not to Love  A Woman's Weakness claims a Woman's Pity  QUEEN  A Rival's Joys demand a Rival's Hate  If female Passions sway with lordly Rule  Revenge may glow with Fires as hot as Lust  Shall I forgive thee and destroy myself  What let thee live to triumph o'er my Folly  Again to riot in my HENRY'S Arms  And in each Fit of wanton Dalliance  To lisp and prattle o'er the dismal Tale  Then kiss and make him swear 'Tis pitiful  By Heav'n it makes Imagination mad  ROSAMOND  Witness the Pow'r supreme that sees my Shame  I here renounce for ever HENRY'S Love  Tho' Life itself would thus be dearly bought  But I've a fearful Reck'ning yet to make  Much from my Soul is due to injur'd Heav'n  Will these few Pangs discharge the Debt or will  A Moment's Sorrow pay for Years of Guilt  QUEEN  That as Heav'n pleases but my Anger's urgent  And now demands an instant Sacrifice  ROSAMOND  Let me but live Is that so great a Boon  I'll wander in the World a Vagabond  Turn'd loose from Humankind forlorn and wild  Each scornful Tongue that hail'd my happier Days  Shall mock my abject Fall I'll owe my Life  To common Charity from Door to Door  I'll beg Subsistence and be proud to feast  Upon the Refuse of gorg'd Appetite  And when the Wrath of Heav'n is satisfy'd  And the full Term of all my Woes expires  On the cold Flint I'll stretch my weary'd Limbs  And bless thy Name and die  QUEEN  Shame of thy Sex  Whom can thy Blessings help or Curses hurt  Why do I trifle thus It is resolv'd  Inexorable Justice claims her Right  ROSAMOND  'Tis Cruelty not Justice thirsts for Blood  QUEEN  Be't which it will it must be satisfy'd  ROSAMOND  What canst thou gain by killing me  QUEEN  Revenge  ROSAMOND  Will  England  's Queen avow so poor a Motive  QUEEN  Will  England  's Queen conform her great Designs  To vulgar Rules of Action Thou shalt die  ROSAMOND  Then 'tis in vain to struggle with my Fate  Yes I will die and glory in my Love  For it is constant gen'rous fixt and true  The Will's firm Union not the Form of Law  It is my Pride and I defy thy Malice  Shall HENRY'S Mistress fear a Rival's Rage  His Love shall chear me in my latest Moment  It shall deceive thy Cruelty to mark  With how serene a Brow I meet my Death  And thou shalt envy Nature's parting Pang  QUEEN  So bold But we shall try this boasted Courage  ROSAMOND  Then be my Blood on thy devoted Head  My Lord my HENRY shall revenge my Death  And when the World shall hear our fatal Story  Thy savage Rage and unrelenting Hate  Shall brand thy Name with Infamy for ever  My hapless Lot shall find a gentler Treatment  And Aftertimes indulgent to the Weakness  That present Censure magnifies with Malice  Shall rank me high among Heroic Lovers  That liv'd Love's Votaries and dy'd its Martyrs  QUEEN  In that poor Comfort go and lose thy Life  Advance ye Instruments of my just Vengeance  And do the Work of Fate Bear her to Death  Enter  GUARD  ROSAMOND  What do I see it melts my fixt Resolves  Courage and Innocence would shake at this  What then must Guilt and feeble Woman feel  And must I fall by Ruffians brutal Hands  O yet forgive my Rashness spare my Life  Spare me at least the Horror of this Sight  Discharge these ghastly and grimfeatur'd Wretches  And take my Life with thy own Royal Hand  QUEEN  It is beneath me Hence Away with her  ROSAMOND  Pause yet one last sad Moment and I go  Since Death is sure let me not die like one  That has no Foresight of a long Hereafter  Tongue cannot tell the Anguish I now feel  O may it purchase my eternal Peace  Thee mighty Queen I above measure wrong'd  Yet this is surely Punishment enough  If 'tis too much Heav'n pardon the Excess  And not impute Severity of Justice  Be thou yet happy in thy HENRY'S Love  And with my Life let ev'ry Discord cease  Yet let him wet my Tomb with one sad Tear  And pity her his fatal Love has ruin'd  Then may he quite forget our guilty Joys  And bless the Nations with his Royal Virtues  Life Love and HENRY all Adieu for ever  Exit  ROSAMOND  guarded  QUEEN  The painful Task is done and grievous 'twas  To trace the strong Emotions of her Soul  This Suff'ring is enough for all her Crimes  But lo the silver Gleam of Morning breaks  O thou supreme allwise o'erruling Pow'r  That seest the mighty Wrongs of ELINOR  Bless if it seemeth good this honest Art  And touch with deep Remorse my HENRY'S Heart  But if 'tis fix'd by thy unalter'd Will  That I should still be scorn'd be wretched still  If 'tis recorded in the Book of Fate  That I was born to love and He to hate  The next sad Boon my weary'd Soul shall crave  Is Rest eternal and a peaceful Grave  Exit  SCENE II  Enter Prince  HENRY  Earls of  SURRY  and  WINCHESTER  P  HENRY  It cannot be The Army all dispers'd  And the  Scotch  King himself ta'en Prisoner  This strikes our blasted Purpose to the Root  Yet do we hold ourself as full of Spirit  And royal Quality as when we thought  To seat us in our Father's tott'ring Throne  But halt we here and cease the noble Chace  Let Glory hide awhile his radiant Head  Till bursting like the Sun from Ocean's Lap  Once more he pours the Beams of Day around  Say where's the Righthand of our Enterprize  The trusty LEICESTER  SURRY  May it please your Grace  By your Command I went last Night t'apprise  His Lordship of our sudden Overthrow  But he was then gone forth 'twas said in private  P  HENRY  Shield him ye Stars my everfaithful Friend  That nurs'd my Youth e'en like a tender Plant  One Day to flourish in fair  England  's Garden  WINCHESTER  Look where he comes and lo a sullen Guard  Of Officers of State attend upon him  Death sits in Pomp upon each Countenance  Enter  LEICESTER  guarded  P  HENRY  Whence is it LEICESTER that I see thee thus  I've known the Time when I had flown to meet thee▪  Swift as the fabled  Mercury  Methought  I could have grasp'd thee to my Heart for ever  And youthful Love's Embrace was cold to mine  But now forbidding Horrors dwell around thee  And this first time I wish thee from my Sight  Far as quick Magic or the Stretch of Thought  Could waft thee hence Alas what mean these Bonds  LEICESTER  I am thy Father's Pris'ner by what Chance  It matters not And 'tis with Joy I tell it  I shall not be so long for I'm to die  This World has trifled with my Expectations  And I shall leave it with Indifference  Like a disgusted Friend  P  HENRY  Didst thou say die  Where is the Pow'r on Earth shall take thee from me  Against my Will By Heav'n my Heat of Soul  Transports me to the thund'ring Front of Battle  Have I no Friends Methinks ten thousand Swords  With sympathetic Rage should leave their Scabbards  And forcing Conquest from the Hand of Fortune  Rescue thy Life and my insulted Honour  LEICESTER  Why dost thou spend thy frantic Breath in vain  Thus ruin'd as I am I pity thee  P  HENRY  How steady is thy Heart Blest Lot of Virtue  To her Death seems a kind Deliverer  By whom the Soul longcumber'd is set free  And quits the Circumscription of her Prison  To range the Regions of unbounded Space  O hadst thou clos'd thine Eyes in Honour's Bed  The glorious Fate had claim'd my Gratulation  But shall my Friend be led to shameful Death  To formal public Execution  And make a Holyday for vile Plebeians  Can I endure all thisCan I prevent it  The mournful Image sinks me into Childhood  And from my Eyes the deepfetch'd Sorrow flows  LEICESTER  Weep not for Tears are Woman's Ceremony  My Life has been a Hurricane throughout  And I will raise a Storm at my Departure  As the fell Lightning strikes while it does vanish  P  HENRY  Thy Talk is wild Is't possible to save thee  I will unhinge the vast Machinery  Of Sov'reign Greatness that my Soul had fram'd  And be that dull unthinking Thing I was  Ere yet inspir'd by thy awak'ning Breath  The Flame of Glory play'd about my Heart  For thee I will renounce this Bauble Crown  Throw myself prostrate at my Father's Feet  And there solicit for thy valu'd Life  LEICESTER  Think not of me solicit for thyself  Ask Pardon for the Follies of thy Youth  And promise better Carriage for the future  A little Whining will set Matters right  The old Man kindly takes you by the Hand  Bids you sit still and all shall be forgotten  P  HENRY  Still LEICESTER dost thou thwart my good Intent  As if to be oblig'd were worse than Death  LEICESTER  Then hear me hear me and be lost for ever  Thou poor misguided Tool thou Pygmy Monarch  Thou Frothmade Creature of a Courtier's Guile  Think not I ever bore Respect to thee  Further than Shew would answer my Design  Thou and thy fansy'd Title were the Engines  Of my Ambition and highcrested Hopes  Had Fate done Justice to my noble Daring  I'd rioted at Will in lawless Pow'r  And everblooming LoveO ROSAMOND  My Thought still cleaves to theeBut all is past  And the whole World is now not worth my Notice  P  HENRY  Tell me good SURRY does not this Man rave  Or am I here or who or what are you  O 'tis too much too much  SURRY  Accursed Villain  You're much disturb'd my Lord You grasp my Hand  As you'd dissolve it and Convulsions rend  Your struggling Heart like the last Gasps of Nature  LEICESTER  Why surely 'twill be glorious Fun'ral Pomp  When Princes are the Mourners  P  HENRY  It shall be soWhere is this Son of Darkness  I will defile my Sword with his Heart's Blood  And drive his Soul back to the Devil his Master  LEICESTER  Ay kill me do and I shall die in Triumph  P  HENRY  Hold Shall I save him from the Hand of Justice  And honour his foul TreasonDrag him hence  Be sure you grind his Carcase into Dust  Then send each Particle to hottest Hell  To suffer sep'rate Pain  LEICESTER  I leave my Imprecations to you all  I have disturb'd Mankind and die content  Exit guarded  P  HENRY  If there's a Torment yet unfelt below  Thou wilt disturb the Damn'dFor me what's left  But airencount'ring Wrath and sad Despair  And selfreproaching ShameAre you my Friends  Give me Credentials of your Honesty  Smile cringe and hug and swear and then deceive me  SURRY  Could I unfold the Bottom of my Heart  Your Grace would see it all your own  P  HENRY  Impossible  I tell thee SURRY there's no Faith in Nature  I'd ride a Bulrush in a stormy Sea  Ere I would trust a Friend Ingratitude  Thou damning Sin of Devils and of Men  Our PatriarchFather happy in himself  Enjoy'd his solitary Paradise  But his first Bosomfriend his Wife betray'd him  WINCHESTER  My Soul abhors the Falshood of that Traitor  For me  P  HENRY  Heav'n only knows how much I lov'd him  He lay within my Bosom's closest Fold  And saw the Springs that mov'd my Soul to Action  Had one poor Morsel been my Life's Subsistence  And LEICESTER'S craving Appetite unsated  He should have shar'd his precious Moiety  Exact even to a breathlight Atom's Weight  Is this the Man that has abus'd me thus  The brute Beast softens to good Offices  The churlish Cur frisks at his Master's Feet  Nay the great Lion fondles with his Keeper  And bloody Tygers lick the Hand that feeds them  Man only of all Creatures is ungrateful  Heav'n too but wastes its Bounty on the Wretch  Why sheds yon golden Orb his daily Light  Mark his meridian Brightness glares unheeded  By thankless Mortals like a common Meteor  WINCHESTER  Forget what's pastAwake your wonted Spirit  P  HENRY  Never my LordBut Yesterday methought  Like a full Tide I spread myself abroad  While Plenty smil'd along my fruitful Shores  But now Heav'n's scorching Wrath has choak'd my Springs  My sinking Stream forsakes its thirsty Banks  And all my Urns are dryO I'm undone  WINCHESTER  Kind Heav'n send Peace to your disorder'd Soul  P  HENRY  Why dost thou talk of Peace Orig'nal Chaos  Was more at Peace than I If thou would'st please me  Drive me into some vast Extremity  Some Precedent of Horror yet unheardof  Would I could conjure up a hellish Spirit  Should rend asunder this Seamantled Isle  Sure I am fit for nought but some damn'd Deed  To chronicle my Name a Plague for ever  SURRY  Come come my Lord Youth is a sportive Tale  That Men peruse and are not critical  The King will yet forgive on Terms of Honour  The Rashness of us all  P  HENRY  Curse his Forgiveness  Was I acquitted to Ten thousand Worlds  O I should damn myself Has HENRY been  The chosen Instrument of Knavery  Still pliant to a Villain's forming Hand  And am I but a Dupe to such a Wretch  Impartial Fame that registers all Deeds  Will write this first Page of my History  In Terms most vile and insignificant  Had I the nervous Arms of HERCULES  The ample Sway of PHILIP'S conqu'ring Son  Proud CAESAR'S Fortune or great ARTHUR'S Soul  HARRY and Fool would still be join'd together  O Shame eternal insupportable  SURRY  To err is to be mortal Where is he  That falls not in the slipp'ry Path of Life  But future Conduct cancels Failings past  All may be yet retriev'd the cloudwrapt Morn  Is oft the Prologue to a glorious Day  P  HENRY  Think'st thou I bear an ordinary Mind  Who sets out wrong ought to forego his Journey  Hence I'll divorce me from the faithless World  Step from the Prince and study to forget  My Royal Sphere 'till I am reconcil'd  To low Obscurity and abject Life  And ev'ry Thought be level with my Fate  SURRY  These deep Refinements seem akin to Madness  Aside  Your Highness speaks the Language of Despair  P  HENRY  I speak but what I feel Methinks 'tis done  By Heav'n I would not stoop to take a Crown  The Head that wears that shining Burden akes for't▪  Who rules too rules o'er Men and I'd not hold  All Earth upon Security precarious  As is the Weatherchanging Faith of Men  I hold no farther Correspondence with them  Let the vile Miscreants prey on one another  While I on Fortune's mischievous Caprice  Will diet my Reflection and refine  To pure Conception my worldweaned Soul  How happy is the Sage in his Retreat  That human Footsteps never yet profan'd  No jarring Passions vex his gentle Breast  Peace crowns his Days his Nights unbroken Rest  Slave to no Int'rest aiming at no End  He neither fears a Foe nor wants a Friend  Careless what Nations rise what Empires fall  He hears not wild Ambition's noisy Call  Wise to shun Pleasure Fortune to defy  He only seems to live that he may die  Exeunt  The End of the  FOURTH ACT  ACT V  SCENE I  ROSAMOND  asleep Enter the Earl of  SALISBURY  SALISBURY  SEE where she lies asleep poor fallen Cherub  The maiden Freshness of th'ungather'd Rose  But imitates that Sweetness Fair to look on  Why art thou all Deformity within  Oh how unhappy is the Fate of Beauty  It tempts the Ruffian Hand of Violence  And like the Diamond sparkling in the Mine  With its own Lustre lights the greedy Spoiler  O ROSAMOND had but indulgent Heav'n  Blasted the early Spring of thy Perfections  'Tis like thy Life had been as innocent  As that same guiltless SlumberBut she wakes  I'll stand awhile apart  ROSAMOND  Have Mercy on me  My Fears confound meThis sad Dwelling seems  The Antichamber to eternal Darkness  They left me here to dreadful Meditation  And weary'd Nature since has sunk in Sleep  Am I to live Why then that Ceremony  That dismal Pomp of Death Or do they mock me  Staying the Execution of my Fate  To fright my ApprehensionHah Who's there  It is my Father's Friend the good Lord SALISBURY  SALISBURY  O ROSAMOND I comeBut I must weep first  ROSAMOND  Weep Blood my Heart for ev'ry Tear he sheds  Dost thou behold me with a tender Eye  Thou that dost Honour to the House of CLIFFORD  While I vile Wretch was born but to disgrace it  SALISBURY  Believe me Fairone these same falling Tears  Adorn thee more than Beauty's brightest Bloom  'Twas That betray'd thee to eternal Shame  And dy'd thy Soul in complicated Guilt  But Tears shall wash the scarlet Stains away  ROSAMOND  Thy charitable Care and mild Address  Bespeak my warmest ThanksSay my good Lord  Where is my injur'd Father May I hope  For once I knew him of a gentle Nature  He can have Pity on an only Child  Wretched and sad as Sin and Shame can make her  For ohDespair will sink me if I die  Beneath the Terrors of his righteous Curse  SALISBURY  There yet remains a dismal Tale to tell  Alas my Friend thy Father is no more  But Yesterday he dy'd by LEICESTER'S Hand  In his last Moments he remembred Thee  Think it an Earnest of forgiving Heav'n  He own'd his Daughter in that fatal Crisis  And bless'd thee with the Fervency of Pray'r  ROSAMOND  This was my Deed I kill'd this best of Fathers  I drove his hoary Age to Desperation  And made his Being painfulSo is mine  For I am now a Burden to myself  Yet he forgave mePonder that my Soul  'Tis growing Matter for eternal Thought  My Lord thou know'st my Doom Am I to die  SALISBURY  You must prepare to live Last Night the Queen  But hypocritical in Cruelty  Beneath the Mask of Vengeance meant thee Mercy  That dreadful Guard that bore thee from the Palace  As to thy Fate when they convey'd thee hither  Fulfill'd their whole Commission In this Convent  Thou must commence the Votary of Heav'n  And bid Adieu to all the World for ever  ROSAMOND  Confess my Heart the Hand of Providence  Plain tho' unseen in all its Acts of Mercy  Here let me first in pious Gratitude  Implore a Blessing on her Royal Head  Who tho' my Rival was not less my Friend  May Peace and Joy and Love crown all her Hours  And when her Length of Life is fully spun  Let not Death seem a King of Terrors to her  But like a smiling Angel sent to guide  Her fleeting Soul to Realms of endless Bliss  SALISBURY  Thy grateful Pray'r is just And now O think  Think what a Lesson thou must teach thyself  Canst thou forget the Luxury of Courts  The soft'ning Joys of Vanity and Ease  And Pleasure's sweet Inchantment of the Mind  Say canst thou quench the Fire of youthful Love  And blot the Name of HENRY from thy Heart  Canst thou devote thyself to pious Deeds  To painful rigid Holiness of Life  To Meditation at the Midnight Hour  To constant Watchings and long Abstinence  Religious Toil that mortifies the Sense  This is the Physic of a sickly Soul  That labours to redeem its forfeit Peace  ROSAMOND  O Terms of Life severe yet merciful  The wholsome Discipline of Penitence  Shall reconcile me to offended Grace  Wilt thou thou good old Man solicit for me  Thy pious Intercession well shall speed  My tardy Vows and waft them up to Heav'n  Hence I give up the World without a Sigh  The World What's that I give up HENRY too  The Bubble breaks the painted Scene is clos'd  And now the calm and sadlypleasing View  Of peaceful Innocence and purer Joys  And Virtue blasted like a beaten Flower  Shocks my Remembrance and upbraids my Soul  SALISBURY  Sense of past Vice is future Virtue's Basis  And Selfconviction at the Bar of Conscience  More awes the waken'd Mind than the Tribunal  Of solemn Justice and the Pomp of Law  Methinks I hear the Host celestial shout  And praise the noble Purpose thou hast made  Heav'n is not deaf to Sorrow's piercing Voice  Relenting it beholds the wounded Breast  And kindly sheds the healing Balm of Mercy  ROSAMOND  Thy Words distil the honey'd Sweets of Peace  A Beam of Comfort chears my sinking Soul  And brighter Prospects open to my View  Folly has sully'd my Renown of Youth  But strict Severity of Thought and Action  Shall change the black Complexion of my Guilt  To Snowwhite Purity Ages to come  Shall hear my Tale with Pity not Reproach  And those who curse the shameful Name of  Mistress  Shall bless the Convert and admire the Saint  SALISBURY  If the blest Lot of righteous Men above  Admits of Augmentation it will glad  Thy Father's Spirit to perceive this Change  And give a better Relish to his Heav'n  ROSAMOND  From my Example let the Fair be warn'd  To shun the pleasing Snares of lawless Love  As they would fly the Serpent's bitter Tooth  Its sweetest Pleasures leave a Sting behind  To virtuous Minds Religion's Path is smooth  But she that falls like me like me must tread  The thorny Road of sad Remorse and Sorrow  Hail gloomy Mansions hail Here will I dwell  In lonely Cloisters and a dreary Cell  A sad Recluse I'll waste my Youth away  Steal from Mankind and shun the Face of Day  Exeunt  SCENE II  Enter King  HENRY  and Attendants  At length the holy Task is full perform'd  And my freed Soul is clear of BECKET'S Murder  Now we may view our Royal State at Home  Our Brother SCOTLAND is our Prisoner  If we think good we seize upon his Crown  Or bid him reign the Monarch of our Nod  Let him attend the Sentence of our Will  For our proud Son we trust this late Defeat  And LEICESTER'S Death shall clip his tow'ring Wing  Of him we shall think further at our Leisure  For now more tender Thoughts possess my Soul  To Love's soft Influence all its Motions yield  And ev'ry Passion owns its sov'reign Master  Queen of my Heart my ROSAMOND I come  Enter the Duke of  CORNWALL  Hah CORNWALL why that Terror in thy Look  CORNWALL  Pardon my Liege the Messenger of Fate  That brings afflicting Tidings to your Ear  But what is done 'twere Folly to disguise  Then to be brief Last Night the jealous QUEEN  K  HENRY  Hold on thy Life Thou dost affright Conception  I could with Patience hear the Knell of Death  But not thy horrid Tale Yet let me know it  Proceed and tell me nought but Truth thou Wretch  But dare not tell me ROSAMOND is dead  CORNWALL  See where she comes herself I stand discharg'd  Of my ungrateful Office  Enter  QUEEN  K  HENRY  Can it be  With how compos'd a Brow she hides her Guilt  Dovelike Appearance with a Serpent's Heart  May I not hope a Woman will speak Truth  To do a Mischief Therefore tell me ELINOR  Without the forc'd Evasion of a Lye  Where is my Love my Life my ROSAMOND  QUEEN  Would all King HENRY'S Foes were safe as she  Poor Wretch she's fast asleep  K  HENRY  What dost thou mock me  Dost thou with Triumph own thy Cruelty  My vast Revenge shall tear theeSoft my Soul  This Rage becomes me notFly hence thou Tygress  Lest I forget in Wrath myself and thee  And stain my Hands ignobly with thy Blood  QUEEN  Thy Menaces great Monarch fright me not  What I have done was but the Deed of Justice  Didst thou believe me then so tame of Soul  That I could bear my Injuries for ever  Yet HENRY in my utmost Pride of Heart  Let me confess my tender Love for thee  Cast out that hated Wanton from thy Thoughts  And I can yet forgive thee all my Wrongs  K  HENRY  'Tis well Thank Heav'n in full Contempt I hear thee  But O Philosophy's no Cure for Love  This only Way Fate could unman my Soul  O ROSAMOND for ever ever lost  My Love was sweeter than the op'ning Flow'r  That trembles with the Morning silver's Dew  Fair as the Down of Swans or Mountain's Snow  Then she was faithful as the Turtle's Mate  And harmless as the Smile of Infancy  Why was I born a Ruler of the World  First Potentate on Earth and Lord of Nations  Yet could not keep one Jewel worth them all  O ROSAMOND for ever ever lost  QUEEN  Triumphant happy Rival ev'n in Death  Does then a a Harlot's Fate deserve those Tears  Had the cold Tomb receiv'd me to my Rest  It had not cost thy barb'rous Heart a Sigh  Thou wouldst have bless'd the lucky Destiny  That took away the nauseous Inconvenience  K  HENRY  Time was I did revere thy boasted Virtue  Now thou hast done a Deed that startles Nature  And wouldst thou still profess thy Love for me  Can Hell produce Hypocrisy like thine  Would she that loves me stab me to the Heart  Couldst thou have form'd one tender gen'rous Thought  Thou hadst in Pity spar'd my Soul's first Darling  Thy Mercy had well prov'd thy Love unfeign'd  And won my Praise and Fame's fair Palm for ever  But now awayThou dost delight in Blood  QUEEN  Could I have hop'd my Lord by gentle Means  K  HENRY  Silence false Woman Thou didst know full well  The Temper of my Soul by Nature noble  And now ev'n now I mean to prove it so  'Twas thine to gratify a mean Revenge  The King and Husband scorns to stoop so low  Go hence and let thy Punishment be Life  What have I done Alas my ROSAMOND  Didst thou not call upon thy HENRY'S Name  Didst thou not wish me to avenge thy Death  Oh no thy tender Nature did forgive  The Stroke of Cruelty and dy'd in Smiles  QUEEN  I can no more  Joy to thy Heart thy ROSAMOND yet lives  K  HENRY  Hah did I hear Was it an Angel's Voice  Speak it O speak again ye Heav'ns in Thunder  QUEEN  I told my Lord that ROSAMOND yet lives  K  HENRY  Where is she Let me fly into her Arms  That I may tell my Heart's full Transport there  Lost Crowns recover'd sprightly Health restor'd  To Nature sunk were Blessings poor to this  Who sav'd her precious Life He's my best Friend  And let him take a Kingdom for his Service  QUEEN  That Friend was I  K  HENRY  What can thy Malice mean  Fortune acts underhand and fools my Soul  Whom shall I hear or what shall I believe  Can none resolve my Doubts My Lord of CORNWALL  As thou know'st ought has chanc'd I charge thee speak  CORNWALL  My Liege the QUEEN has utter'd but the Truth  K  HENRY  O ye immortal Pow'rs how can this be  QUEEN  That I've this Day abus'd your Royal Ear  Thus humbly on my Knee I ask Forgiveness  'Tis the first Time I ever yet deceiv'd you  Let Actions speak for me hear and believe  How I have lov'd thee how I love thee still  Fortune last Night gave me sure means of Vengeance  But great as thine my Soul disdain'd them all  She lives my Rival lives tho' not for thee  Happy tho' thou shalt charm her Eyes no more  A Convent's sacred Walls secure the Fair  Where Heav'n I trust shall with free Grace accept  The pious Tribute of her future Duty  K  HENRY  If this be trueand sure I feel it is  I must not dare not think how I have wrong'd thee  Earth does not bear so black a Wretch as me  What hast thou done Thou hast been wond'rous good  Yet cruel to ExcessSee her no more  Shine then no longer SunWhat not to part  Not one kind Word one Kiss one last Embrace  O mournful sad eternal Banishment  Banish'd From whence From a wild World of Folly  To Virtue's calm Abode banish'd to Heav'n  And am I griev'd at this because I lov'd her  O sudden painful Test of Sense and Honour  Strong is the Voice of Reason and of Virtue  But Love pleads too and Nature will be heard  QUEEN  I did not this with any mean Design  Virtue seeks not Advantage from her Deeds  Therefore I say not this deserves your Kindness  The cool Respect of Gratitude I scorn  My Love for thee was ever from the Heart  And equal Love alone can make me happy  Else tho' undone I have discharg'd my Duty  K  HENRY  I pr'ythee pr'ythee leave me ELINOR  Yet stayBy Heav'ns again she holds me fast  The lovely Image clings about my Soul  Hence dear Illusion pleasing Phantom vanish  'Tis doneMethinks yon golden Cloud descends  And lo a heav'nly Form that calls my Love  And now they glide across th' ethereal Plain  Am I then left behind For what just Heav'n  Do I not know for what  'Tis mad to pause and madder to resolve  O that for one kind Minute Thought could stagnate  QUEEN  Assist his struggling Soul allgracious Heav'n

pant for Glory  But as the Seeds of Honour grew within me  An artful Villain tamper'd with the Soil  And spoil'd a goodly CropThe rest you know  Fortune unequal to my daring Cause  Has open'd since my Eyes I wak'd indeed  But only wak'd to see my Shame and Sorrow  K  HENRY  Can I have Faith in this Thou hast deceiv'd me  P  HENRY  'Twas in the fatal Day of youthful Folly  But now the Purpose of Deceit is over  For I am going henee to that high Court  Where Cunning cannot screen or Darkness hide  QUEEN  Alas my Fears What didst thou say my Son  P  HENRY  Let me not waste my most important Moments  I have this Morning drank a deadly Draught  I feel allconqu'ring Death advancing on me  He lays close Siege My sinking Spirits fail  My Nerves are slacken'd all my Blood runs cold  And Nature's Outworks yield tho' still my Heart  Like a strong Citadel resists the Storm  QUEEN  Is there no Help O fatal woful Deed  P  HENRY  Why weeps my gentle Mother What I did  Was in the Frenzy of extreme Despair  And Madness if my Hopes have not been flatter'd  Bars not the Gate of everlasting Mercy  Reason has since resum'd her proper Seat  And all is calm withinYet would I take  A Father's

old CLIFFORD  It is beneath a King to do Injustice  But it is more beneath him to defend it  Will he forgive my Baseness For methinks  All is not right till he is reconcil'd  SALISBURY  That's spoke indeed like great PLANTAGENET  I read Content in ev'ry chearful Face  And I am griev'd to spoil the gen'ral Joy  My Liege poor CLIFFORD lies a breathless Coarse  By LEICESTER slainBut dying he forgave you  It ever was his Wish to see this Day  K  HENRY  By holy Friendship thou hast touch'd my Soul  It was but Yesterday I saw him well  His keen Device did gall me to the Heart  CLIFFORD accept these Tears for Tears are all  The Monarch or the Friend can give thee now  We will do Honour to his Memory  And show'r our Royal Bounty on his House  O SAL'SBURY let me take thee to my Heart  Dear as thy Kinsman was  SALISBURY  I thank your Highness  K  HENRY  From this Day's Fortune let crown'd Heads be wise  Kings are not privileg'd to do a Wrong  The Laws divine bear universal Sway  Princes are Men and Men must all obey  Virtue's the Gem that decks the Royal State  And only to be Good is to be Great  Exeunt omnes  THE END
