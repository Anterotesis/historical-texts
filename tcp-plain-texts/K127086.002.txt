 EVELINA OR A YOUNG LADY'S ENTRANCE INTO THE WORLD  VOLUME THE SECOND  DUBLIN  nted for Messrs PRICE CORCORAN R CROSS FISZSIMONS W WHITESTONE CHAMBERLAINE WILLIAMS J HOEY W COLLES E CROSS BURNET WALKER C JENKIN WHITE J EXSHAW J BEATTY and G PERRIN MDCCLXXIX  EVELINA  LETTER I  Evelina in continuation  Holborn  June th  MADAME Duval rose very late this morning and at one o'clock we had but just breakfasted when Miss Branghton her brother Mr Smith and Monsieur du Bois called to enquire after our healths  This civility in young Branghton I much suspect was merely the result of his father's commands but his sister and Mr Smith I soon found had motives of their own Scarce had they spoken to Madame Duval when advancing eagerly to me  "Pray Ma'am"  said Mr Smith  "who was that gentleman"  "Pray Cousin"  cried Miss Branghton was  "not he the same gentleman you ran away with that night at the opera"  "Goodness that he was"  said young  Branghton  "and I declare as soon as ever I saw him I thought I knew his face"  "I'm sure I'll defy you to forget him"  answered his sister  "if once you had seen him he is the finest gentleman I ever saw in my life don't you think so Mr Smith  "Why you won't give the Lady time to speak"  said Mr Smith  "Pray Ma'am what is the gentleman's name"  "Willoughby Sir"  "Willoughby I think I have heard the name Pray Ma'am is he married"  "Lord no that he is not"  cried Miss Branghton  "he looks too smart by a great deal for a married man Pray Cousin how did you get acquainted with him"  "Pray Miss"  said young Branghton in the same breath  "what's his business"  "Indeed I don't know"  answered I  "Something very genteel I dare say"  added Miss Branghton  "because he dresses so fine"  "It ought to be something that brings in a good income"  said Mr Smith  "for I'm sure he did not get that suit of cloaths he had on under thirty or forty pounds for I know the price of Cloaths pretty well pray Ma'am can you tell me what he has a year"  "Don't talk no more about him"  cried Madame Duval  "for I don't like to hear his name I believe he's one of the worst persons in the world for though I never did him no manner of harm nor so much as hurt a hair of his head I know he was an accomplice with that fellow Captain Mirvan to take away my life"  Every body but myself now crowding around her for an explanation a violent rapping at the streetdoor was unheard and without any previous notice in the midst of her narration Sir  Clement Willoughby entered the room They all started and with looks of guilty confusion as if they feared his resentment for having listened to Madame Duval they scrambled for Chairs and in a moment were all formally seated  Sir Clement after a general bow singling out Madame Duval said with his usual easiness  "I have done myself the honour of waiting on you Madam to enquire if you have any commands to Howard Grove whither I am going tomorrow morning"  Then seeing the storm that gathered in her eyes before he allowed her time to answer he addressed himself to me  "And if you Madam have any with which you will honour me I shall be happy to execute them"  "None at all Sir"  "None not to Miss Mirvanno message no letter"  "I wrote to Miss Mirvan yesterday by the post"  "My application should have been earlier had I sooner known your address"  "  Ma foi  "  cried Madame Duval recovering from her surprize  "I believe never nobody saw the like of this"  "Of what Madam"  cried the undaunted Sir Clement turning quick towards her  "I hope no one has offended you"  "You don't hope no such a thing"  cried she half choaked with passion and rising from her chair This motion was followed by the rest and in a moment every body stood up  Still Sir Clement was not abashed affecting to make a bow of  acknowledgment  to the company in general he said  "ParyI begLadiespray Gentlemendon't let me disturb you pray keep your seats"  "Pray Sir"  said Miss Branghton moving a chair towards him  "won't you sit down yourself"  "You are extremely good Ma'am rather than make any disturbance"  And so saying this strange man seated himself as did in an instant every body else even Madame Duval herself who overpowered by his boldness seemed too full for utterance  He then and with as much composure as if he had been an expected guest began to discourse on the weatherits uncertainty the heat of the public places in summer the emptiness of the town and other such common topics  Nobody however answered him Mr Smith seemed afraid young Branghton ashamed M Du Bois amazed Madame Duval enraged and myself determined not to interfere All that he could obtain was the notice of Miss Branghton whose nods smiles and attention had some appearance of entering into conversation with him  At length growing tired I suppose of engaging every body's eyes and nobody's tongue addressing himself to Madame Duval and to me he said  "I regard myself as peculiarly unfortunate Ladies in having fixed upon a time for my visit to Howard Grove when you are absent from it"  "So I suppose Sir so I suppose"  cried Madame Duval hastily rising and the next moment as hastily seating herself  "you'll be a wanting of somebody to make your game of and so you may think to get  me  there againbut I promise you Sir you won't find it so easy a matter to make me a fool and besides that"  raising her voice  "I've found you out I assure you so if ever you go to play your tricks upon me again I'll make no more ado but go directly to a justice of peace so Sir if you can't think of  nothing but making people ride about the Country at all hours of the night just for your diversion why you'll find I know some justices as well as Justice Tyrrel"  Sir Clement was evidently embarrassed at this attack yet he affected a look of surprize and protested he did not understand her meaning  "Well"  cried she  "if I don't wonder where people can get such impudence if you'll say that you'll say any thing however if you swear till you're black in the face I shan't believe you for nobody shan't persuade me out of my senses that I'll promise you"  "Doubtless not Madam"  answered he with some hesitation  "and I hope you do not suspect I ever had such an intention my respect for you"  "O Sir you're vastly polite all of a sudden but I know what it's all forit's only for what you can getyou cou'd treat me like nobody at Howard Grovebut now you see I've a house of my own you've a mind to wheedle yourself into it but I sees your design so you need n't trouble yourself to take no more trouble about that for you shall never get nothing at my housenot so much as a dish of teaso now Sir you see I can play you trick for trick"  There was something so extremely gross in this speech that it even disconcerted Sir Clement who was too much confounded to make any answer  It was curious to observe the effect which his embarrassment added to the freedom with which Madame Duval addressed him had upon the rest of the company every one who before seemed at a loss how or if at all to occupy a chair now filled it with the most easy composure and  Mr Smith whose countenance had exhibited the most striking picture of mortified envy now began to recover his usual expression of satisfied conceit  Young Branghton too who had been apparently awed by the presence of so fine a gentleman was again himself rude and familiar while his mouth was wide distended into a broad grin at hearing  his Aunt give the beau such a trimming  Madame Duval encouraged by this success looked around her with an air of triumph and continued her harangue  "And so Sir I suppose you thought to have had it all your own way and to have comed here as often as you pleased and to have got me to Howard Grove again on purpose to have served me as you did before but you shall see I'm as cunning as you so you may go and find somebody else to use in that manner and to put your mask on and to make a fool of for as to me if you go to tell me your stories about the Tower again for a month together I'll never believe 'em no more and I'll promise you Sir if you think I like such jokes you'll find I'm no such person"  "I assure you Ma'amupon my honourI really don't comprehendI fancy there is some misunderstanding"  "What I suppose you'll tell me next you don't know nothing of the matter"  "Not a word upon my honour"  O Sir Clement thought I is it thus you prize your honour  "  Pardie  "  cried Madame Duval  "this is the most provokingest part of all why you might as well tell me I don't know my own name"  "Here is certainly some mistake for I assure you Ma'am"  "Don't assure me nothing"  cried Madame Duval raising her voice  "I know what I'm saying and so do you too for did not you tell me all that about the Tower and about M Du Boiswhy M Du Bois was n't never there nor nigh it and so it was all your own invention"  "May there not be two persons of the same name the mistake was but natural"  "Don't tell me of no mistake for it was all on purpose besides did not you come all in a mask to the chariot door and help to get me put in that ditchI'll promise you I've had the greatest mind in the world to take the law of you and if ever you do as much again so I will I assure you"  Here Miss Branghton tittered Mr Smith smiled contemptuously and young Branghton thrust his handkerchief into his mouth to stop his laughter  The situation of Sir Clement who saw all that passed became now very awkward even to himself and he stammered very much in saying  "surely Madamsurely youyou cannot do me thethe injustice to thinkthat I had any share in thethethe misfortune which"  "  Ma foi  Sir"  cried Madame Duval with encreasing passion  "you'd best not stand talking to me at that rate I know it  was  youand if you stay there provoking me in such a manner I'll send for a Constable this minute"  Young Branghton at these words in spite of all his efforts burst into a loud laugh nor could either his sister or Mr Smith though with more moderation forbear joining in his mirth  Sir Clement darted his eyes towards them with looks of the most angry contempt and then  told Madame Duval that he would not now detain her to make his vindication but would wait on her some time when she was alone  "O  pardie  Sir"  cried she  "I don't desire none of your company and if you was n't the most impudentest person in the world you would not dare look me in the face"  The ha ha ha's and he he he's grew more and more uncontroulable as if the restraint from which they had burst had added to their violence Sir Clement could no longer endure being the object who excited them and having no answer ready for Madame Duval he hastily stalked towards Mr Smith and young Branghton and sternly demanded what they laughed at  Struck by the air of Importance which he assumed and alarmed at the angry tone of his voice their merriment ceased as instantaneously as if it had been directed by clockwork and they stared foolishly now at him now at each other without making any answer but a simple  "  Nothing  Sir"  "O  pour le coup  "  cried Madame Duval  "this is too much pray Sir what business have you to come here a ordering people that comes to see me I suppose next nobody must laugh but yourself"  "With me Madam"  said Sir Clement bowing  "a  lady  may do any thing and consequently there is no liberty in which I shall not be happy to indulge  you  but it has never been my custom to give the same licence to  gentlemen  "  Then advancing to me who had sat very quietly on a window during this scene he said"  Miss Anville I may at least acquaint our friends at Howard Grove that I had the honour of leaving you in good health"  and then lowering his voice he added  "For Heaven's sake my  dearest creature who are these people and how came you so strangely situated"  "I beg my respects to all the family Sir"  answered I aloud  "and I hope you will find them well"  He looked at me reproachfully but kissed my hand and then bowing to Madame Duval and Miss Branghton passed hastily by the men and made his exit  I fancy he will not be very eager to repeat his visits for I should imagine he has rarely if ever been before in a situation so awkward and disagreeable  Madame Duval has been all spirits and exultation ever since he went and only wishes Captain Mirvan would call that she might  do the same by him  Mr Smith upon hearing that he was a baronet and seeing him drive off in a very beautiful chariot declared that he would not have laughed upon any account had he known his rank and regretted extremely having missed such an opportunity of making so  genteel  an  acquaintance  Young Branghton vowed that if he had known as much he would have  asked for his custom  and his sister has sung his praises ever since protesting she thought  all along  he was a man of  quality  by his  look  LETTER II  Evelina in continuation  THE last three evenings have passed tolerably quiet for the Vauxhall adventures had given Madame Duval a surfeit of public places home  however soon growing tiresome she determined tonight she said to relieve her  ennui  by some amusement and it was therefore settled that we should call upon the Branghtons at their house and thence proceed to Marybone Gardens  But before we reached SnowHill we were caught in a shower of rain we hurried into the shop where the first object I saw was Mr Macartney with a book in his hand seated in the same corner where I saw him last but his looks were still more wretched than before his face yet thinner and his eyes sunk almost hollow into his head He lifted them up as we entered and I even thought that they emitted a gleam of joy involuntarily I made to him my first courtesy he rose and bowed with a precipitation that manifested surprize and confusion  In a few minutes we were joined by all the family except Mr Smith who fortunately was engaged  Had all the future prosperity of our lives depended upon the good or bad weather of this evening it could not have been treated as a subject of greater importance  "Sure never any thing was so unlucky"  "Lord how provoking"  "It might rain for ever if it would hold up now"  These and such expressions with many anxious observations upon the kennels filled up all the conversation till the shower was over  And then a very warm debate arose whether we should pursue our plan or defer it to some finer evening Miss Branghtons were for the former their father was sure it would rain again Madame Duval though she detested returning home yet dreaded the dampness of the gardens  M Du Bois then proposed going to the top of  the house to examine whether the clouds looked threatening or peaceable Miss Branghton starting at this proposal said they might go to Mr Macartney's room if they would but not to her's  This was enough for the brother who with a loud laugh declared he would have some  fun  and immediately led the way calling to us all to follow His sisters both ran after him but no one else moved  In a few minutes young Branghton coming half way down stairs called out  "Lord why don't you all come why here's Poll's things all about the room  Mr Branghton then went and Madame Duval who cannot bear to be excluded from whatever is going forward was handed up stairs by M Du Bois  I hesitated a few moments whether or not to join them but soon perceiving that Mr Macartney had dropped his book and that I engrossed his whole attention I prepared from mere embarrassment to follow them  As I went I heard him move from his chair and walk slowly after me Believing that he wished to speak to me and earnestly desiring myself to know if by your means I could possibly be of any service to him I first slackened my pace and then turned back But though I thus met him halfway he seemed to want courage or resolution to address me for when he saw me returning with a look extremely disordered he retreated hastily from me  Not knowing what I ought to do I went to the streetdoor where I stood some time hoping he would be able to recover himself but on the contrary his agitation encreased every moment he walked up and down the room in a quick but  unsteady pace seeming equally distressed and irresolute and at length with a deep sigh he flung himself into a chair  I was so much affected by the appearance of such extreme anguish that I could remain no longer in the room I therefore glided by him and went up stairs but ere I had gone five steps he precipitately followed me and in a broken voice called out  "Madamfor Heaven's sake"  He stopped but I instantly descended restraining as well as I was able the fullness of my own concern I waited some time in painful expectation for his speaking all that I had heard of his poverty occurring to me I was upon the point of presenting him my purse but the fear of mistaking or offending him deterred me Finding however that he continued silent I ventured to say  "Did youSir wish to speak to me"  "I did"  cried he with quickness  "but nowI cannot"  "Perhaps Sir another timeperhaps if you recollect yourself"  "Another time"  repeated he mournfully  "alas I look not forward but to misery and despair"  "O Sir"  cried I extremely shocked  "you must not talk thusif you forsake  yourself  how can you expect"  I stopped  "Tell me tell me  "cried he with eagerness  "who you arewhence you comeand by what strange means you seem to be arbitress and ruler of the destiny of such a wretch as I am"  "Would to Heaven"  cried I  "I could serve you"  "You can"  "And how pray tell me how"  "To tell youis death to me yet I  will  tell youI have a  right  to your assistanceyou have deprived me of the only resource to which I could applyand therefore"  "Pray pray speak"  cried I putting my hand into my pocket  "they will be down stairs in a moment"  "I will MadamCan youwill youI think you willmay I then"  he stopped and paused  "say will you"  then suddenly turning from me  "Great Heaven I cannot speak"  and he went back to the shop  I now put my purse in my hand and following him said  "If indeed Sir I can assist you why should you deny me so great a satisfaction Will you permit me to"  I dared not go on but with a countenance very much softened he approached me and said  "Your voice Madam is the voice of Compassionsuch a voice as these ears have long been strangers to"  Just then young Branghton called out vehemently to me to come up stairs I seized the opportunity of hastening away and therefore saying  "Heaven Sir protect and comfort you"  I let fall my purse upon the ground not daring to present it to him and ran up stairs with the utmost swiftness  Too well do I know you my ever honoured Sir to fear your displeasure for this action I must however assure you I shall need no fresh supply during my stay in town as I am at little expence and hope soon to return to Howard Grove  Soon did I say when not a fortnight is yet  expired of the long and tedious month I must linger out here  I had many witticisms to endure from the Branghtons upon account of my staying so long with the  Scotch mope  as they call him but I attend to them very little for my whole heart was filled with pity and concern I was very glad to find the Marybone scheme was deferred another shower of rain having put a stop to the dissention upon this subject the rest of the evening was employed in most violent quarrelling between Miss Polly and her brother on account of the discovery made by the latter of the state of her apartment  We came home early and I have stolen from Madame Duval and M Du Bois who is here for ever to write to my best friend  I am most sincerely rejoiced that this opportunity has offered for my contributing what little relief was in my power to this unhappy man and I hope it will be sufficient to enable him to pay his debts to this pitiless family  LETTER III  Mr Villars to Evelina  Berry Hill  DISPLEASURE my Evelinayou have but done your duty you have but shewn that humanity without which I should blush to own my child It is mine however to see that your generosity be not repressed by your suffering from indulging it I remit to you therefore not merely a token of my approbation but an acknowledgment of my desire to participate in your charity  O my child were my fortune equal to my confidence in thy benevolence with what transport should I through thy means devote it to the relief of indigent virtue yet let us not repine at the limitation of our power for while our bounty is proportioned to our ability the difference of the greater or less donation can weigh but little in the scale of Justice  In reading your account of the misguided man whose misery has so largely excited your compassion I am led to apprehend that his unhappy situation is less the effect of misfortune than of misconduct If he is reduced to that state of poverty represented by the Branghtons he should endeavour by activity and industry to retrieve his affairs and not pass his time in idle reading in the very shop of his creditor  The pistol scene made me shudder the courage with which you pursued this desperate man at once delighted and terrified me Be ever thus my dearest Evelina dauntless in the cause of distress let no weak fears no timid doubts deter you from the exertion of your duty according to the fullest sense of it that Nature has implanted in your mind Though gentleness and Modesty are the peculiar attributes of your sex yet fortitude and firmness when occasion demands them are virtues as noble and as becoming in women as in men the right line of conduct is the same for both sexes though the manner in which it is pursued may somewhat vary and be accommodated to the strength or weakness of the different travellers  There is however something so mysterious in all you have yet seen or heard of this wretched man that I am unwilling to stamp a bad impression of his character upon so slight and partial a knowledge of it Where any thing is doubtful the ties of society and the laws of humanity  claim a favourable interpretation but remember my dear child that those of discretion have an equal claim to your regard  As to Sir Clement Willoughby I know not how to express my indignation at his conduct Insolence so unsufferable and the implication of suspicions so shocking irritate me to a degree of wrath which I hardly thought my almost wornout passions were capable of again experiencing You must converse with him no more he imagines from the pliability of your temper that he may offend you with impunity but his behaviour justifies nay calls for your avowed resentment do not therefore hesitate in forbidding him your sight  The Branghtons Mr Smith and young Brown however illbred and disagreeable are objects too contemptible for serious displeasure yet I grieve much that my Evelina should be exposed to their rudeness and impertinence  The very day that this tedious month expires I shall send Mrs Clinton to town who will accompany you to Howard Grove Your stay there will I hope be short for I feel daily an encreasing impatience to fold my beloved child to my bosom  ARTHUR VILLARS  LETTER IV  Evelina to the Rev Mr Villars  Holborn  June th  I HAVE just received my dearest Sir your kind present and still kinder letter Surely never had orphan so little to regret as your grateful  Evelina though motherless though worse than fatherless bereft from infancy of the two first and greatest blessings of life never has she had cause to deplore their loss never has she felt the omission of a parent's tenderness care or indulgence never but from sorrow for  them  had reason to grieve at the separation Most thankfully do I receive the token of your approbation and most studiously will I endeavour so to dispose of it as may merit your generous confidence in my conduct  Your doubts concerning Mr Macartney give me some uneasiness Indeed Sir he has not the appearance of a man whose sorrows are the effect of guilt But I hope ere I leave town to be better acquainted with his situation and enabled with more certainty of his worth to recommend him to your favour  I am very willing to relinquish all acquaintance with Sir Clement Willoughby as far as it may depend upon myself so to do but indeed I know not how I should be able to absolutely  forbid him my sight  Miss Mirvan in her last letter informs me that he is now at Howard Grove where he continues in high favour with the Captain and is the life and spirit of the house My time since I wrote last has passed very quietly Madame Duval having been kept at home by a bad cold and the Branghtons by bad weather The young man indeed has called two or three times and his behaviour though equally absurd is more unaccountable than ever he speaks very little takes hardly any notice of Madame Duval and never looks at me without a broad grin Sometimes he approaches me as if with intention to  communicate intelligence of importance and then suddenly stopping short laughs rudely in my face  O how happy shall I be when the worthy Mrs Clinton arrives  July th  Yesterday Morning Mr Smith called to acquaint us that the Hampstead assembly was to be held that evening and then he presented Madame Duval with one ticket and brought another to me I thanked him for his intended civility but told him I was surprized he had so soon forgot my having already declined going to the ball  "Lord Ma'am"  cried he  "how should I suppose you were in earnest come come don't be cross here's your Grandmama ready to take care of you so you can have no fair objection for she'll see that I don't run away with you Besides Ma'am I got the tickets on purpose"  "If you were determined Sir"  said I  "in making me this offer to allow me no choice of refusal or acceptance I must think myself less obliged to your intention than I was willing to do  "Dear Ma'am"  cried he  "you're so smart there is no speaking to youindeed you are monstrous smart Ma'am but come your Grandmama shall ask you and then I know you'll not be so cruel"  Madame Duval was very ready to interfere she desired me to make no further opposition said she should go herself and insisted upon my accompanying her It was in vain that I remonstrated I only incurred her anger and Mr Smith having given both the tickets to Madame Duval with an air of triumph said he should call early in the evening and took leave  I was much chagrined at being thus compelled to owe even the shadow of an obligation to so forward  a young man but I determined that nothing should prevail upon me to dance with him however my refusal might give offence  In the afternoon when he returned it was evident that he purposed to both charm and astonish me by his appearance he was dressed in a very shewy manner but without any taste and the inelegant smartness of his air and deportment his visible struggle against education to put on the fine gentleman added to his frequent conscious glances at a dress to which he was but little accustomed very effectually destroyed his aim of  figuring  and rendered all his efforts useless  During tea entered Miss Branghton and her brother I was sorry to observe the consternation of the former when she perceived Mr Smith I had intended applying to her for advice upon this occasion but been always deterred by her disagreeable abruptness Having cast her eyes several times from Mr Smith to me with manifest displeasure she seated herself sullenly in the window scarce answering Madame Duval's enquiries and when I spoke to her turning absolutely away from me  Mr Smith delighted at this mark of his importance sat indolently quiet on his chair endeavouring by his looks rather to display than to conceal his inward satisfaction  "Good gracious"  cried young Branghton  "why you're all as fine as fivepence Why where are you going"  "To the Hampstead Ball"  answered Mr Smith  "To a ball"  cried he  "Why what is Aunt going to a ball Ha ha ha"  "Yes to be sure"  cried Madame Duval  "I don't know nothing need hinder me"  "And pray Aunt will you dance too"  "Perhaps I may but I suppose Sir that's none of your business whether I do or not"  "Lord well I should like to go I should like to see Aunt dance of all things But the joke is I don't believe she'll get ever a partner  "You're the most rudest boy ever I see"  cried Madame Duval angrily  "but I promise you I'll tell your father what you say for I've no notion of such rudeness"  "Why Lord Aunt what are you so angry for there's no speaking a word but you fly into a passion you're as bad as Biddy or Poll for that for you're always a scolding"  "I desire Tom"  cried Miss Branghton  "you'd speak for yourself and not make so free with my name"  "There now she's up there's nothing but quarrelling with the women it's my belief they like it better than victuals and drink"  "Fie Tom"  cried Mr Smith  "you never remember your manners before the ladies I'm sure you never heard me speak so rude to them"  "Why Lord  you  are a beau but that's nothing to me So if you've a mind you may be so polite as to dance with Aunt yourself"  Then with a loud laugh he declared it would be  good fun  to see them  "Let it be never so good or never so bad"  cried Madame Duval  "you won't see nothing of it I promise you so pray don't let me hear no more of such vulgar pieces of fun for I assure you I don't like it And as to my dancing  with Mr Smith you may see wonderfuller things than that any day in the week"  "Why as to that Ma'am"  said Mr Smith looking much surprised  "I always thought you intended to play at cards and so I thought to dance with the young lady"  I gladly seized this opportunity to make my declaration that I should not dance at all  "Not dance at all"  repeated Miss Branghton  "yes that's a likely matter truly when people go to balls"  "I wish she mayn't"  said the brother  "cause then Mr Smith will have nobody but Aunt for a partner Lord how mad he'll be"  "O as to that"  said Mr Smith  "I do'nt at all fear prevailing with the young lady if once I get her to the room"  "Indeed Sir"  cried I much offended by his conceit  "you are mistaken and therefore I beg leave to undeceive you as you may be assured my resolution will not alter"  "Then pray Miss if it is not impertinent"  cried Miss Branghton sneeringly  "What do you go for"  "Merely and solely"  answered I  "to comply with the request of Madame Duval"  "Miss  cried young Branghton  "Bid only wishes it was she for she has cast a sheep'seye at Mr Smith this long while"  "Tom"  cried the sister rising  "I've the greatest mind in the world to box your ears How dare you say such a thing of me"  "No hang it Tom no that's wrong"  said Mr Smith simpering  "it is indeed to tell the lady's secretsBut never mind him Miss Biddy for I won't believe him"  "Why I know Bid would give her ears to  go"  returned the brother  "but only Mr Smith likes Miss bestso does every body else"  While the sister gave him a very angry answer Mr Smith said to me in a low voice  "Why now Ma'am how can you be so cruel as to be so much handsomer than your cousins Nobody can look at them when you are by"  "Miss"  cried young Branghton  "whatever he says to you don't mind him for he means no good I'll give you my word for it he'll never marry you for he has told me again and again he'll never marry as long as he lives besides if he'd any mind to be married there's Bid would have had him long ago and thanked him too"  "Come come Tom don't tell secrets you'll make the ladies afraid of me but I assure you"  lowering his voice  "if I  did  marry it should be your cousin"  Should  bedid you ever my dear Sir hear such unauthorised freedom I looked at him with a contempt I did not wish to express and walked to the other end of the room  Very soon after Mr Smith sent for a hackneycoach When I would have taken leave of Miss Branghton she turned angrily from me without making any answer She supposes perhaps that I have rather sought than endeavoured to avoid the notice and civilities of this conceited young man  The ball was at the  long room  at Hampstead  This room seems very well named for I believe it would be difficult to find any other epithet which might with propriety distinguish it as it is without ornament elegance or any sort of singularity and merely to be marked by its length  I was saved from the importunities of Mr Smith the beginning of the evening by Madame Duval's declaring her intention to dance the two first dances with him herself Mr Smith's chagrin was very evident but as she paid no regard to it he was necessitated to lead her out  I was however by no means pleased when she said she was determined to dance a minuet Indeed I was quite astonished not having had the least idea she would have consented to much less proposed such an exhibition of her person  She had some trouble to make her intentions known as Mr Smith was rather averse to speaking to the Master of the ceremonies  During this minuet how much did I rejoice in being surrounded only with strangers She danced in a style so uncommon her age her showy dress and an unusual quantity of  rouge  drew upon her the eyes and I fear the derision of the whole company Who she danced with I know not but Smith was so illbred as to laugh at her very openly and to speak of her with as much ridicule as was in his power But I would neither look at nor listen to him nor would I suffer him to proceed with a speech which he began expressive of his vexation at being forced to dance with her I told him very gravely that complaints upon such a subject might with less impropriety be made to every person in the room than to me  When she returned to us she distressed me very much by asking what I thought of her minuet I spoke as civilly as I could but the coldness of my compliment evidently disappointed reh She then called upon Mr Smith to secure a good  place among the countrydancers and away they went though not before he had taken the liberty to say to me in a low voice  "I protest to you Ma'am I shall be quite out of countenance if any of my acquaintance should see me dancing with the old lady"  For a few moments I very much rejoiced at being relieved from this troublesome man but scarce had I time to congratulate myself ere I was accosted by another who  begged the favour of hopping a dance  with me  I told him that I should not dance at all but he thought proper to importune me very freely not to be so cruel and I was obliged to assume no little haughtiness ere I could satisfy him I was serious  After this I was addressed much in the same manner by several other young men of whom the appearance and language were equally inelegant and lowbred so that I soon found my situation was both disagreeable and improper since as I was quite alone I fear I must seem rather to invite than to forbid the offers and notice I received And yet so great was my apprehension of this interpretation that I am sure my dear Sir you would have laughed had you seen how proudly grave I appeared  I knew not whether to be glad or sorry when Madame Duval and Mr Smith returned The latter instantly renewed his tiresome entreaties and Madame Duval said she would go to the cardtable and as soon as she was accommodated she desired us to join the dancers  I will not trouble you with the arguments that followed Mr Smith teazed me till I was weary of resistance and I should at last have been obliged to submit had I not fortunately recollected  the affair of Mr Lovel and told my persecutor that it was impossible I should dance with him even if I wished it as I had refused several persons in his absence  He was not contented with being extremely chagrined but took the liberty openly and warmly to expostulate with me upon not having said I was engaged  The total disregard with which involuntarily I heard him made him soon change the subject In truth I had no power to attend to him for all my thoughts were occupied in retracing the transactions of the two former balls at which I had been present The partythe conversationthe companyO how great the contrast  In a short time however he contrived to draw my attention to himself by his extreme impertinence for he chose to express what he called his  admiration  of me in terms so open and familiar that he forced me to express my displeasure with equal plainness  But how was I surprised when I found he had the temeritywhat else can I call itto impute my resentment to doubts of his honour for he said  "My dear Ma'am you must be a little patient I assure you I have no bad designs I have not upon my word but really there is no resolving upon such a thing as matrimony all at once what with the loss of one's liberty and what with the ridicule of all one's acquaintanceI assure you Ma'am you are the first lady who ever made me even demur upon this subject for after all my dear Ma'am marriage is the devil"  "Your opinion Sir"  answered I  "of either the married or the single life can be of no manner of consequence to me and therefore I would  by no means trouble you to discuss their different merits"  "Why really Ma'am as to your being a little out of sorts I must own I can't wonder at it for to be sure marriage is all in all with the ladies but with us gentlemen it's quite another thing Now only put yourself in my placesuppose you had such a large acquaintance of gentlemen as I haveand that you had always been used to appear a littlea little smart among themwhy now how should you like to let yourself down all at once into a married man"  I could not tell what to answer so much conceit and so much ignorance both astonished and silenced me  "I assure you Ma'am"  added he  "there is not only Miss Biddythough I should have scorned to mention her if her brother had not blab'd for I'm quite particular in keeping ladies secretsbut there are a great many other ladies that have been proposed to mebut I never thought twice of any of themthat is not in a  serious  wayso you may very well be proud"  offering to take my hand  "for I assure you there is nobody so likely to catch me at last as yourself"  "Sir"  cried I drawing myself back as haughtily as I could  "you are totally mistaken if you imagine you have given me any pride I felt not before by this conversation on the contrary you must allow me to tell you I find it too humiliating to bear with it any longer"  I then placed myself behind the chair of Madame Duval who when she heard of the partners I had refused pitied my ignorance of the world but no longer insisted upon my dancing  Indeed the extreme vanity of this man makes me exert a spirit which I did not till now know that I possessed but I cannot endure that he should think me at his disposal  The rest of the evening passed very quietly as Mr Smith did not attempt again to speak to me except indeed after we had left the room and while Madame Duval was seating herself in the coach he said in a voice of  pique  "Next time I take the trouble to get any tickets for a young lady I'll make a bargain beforehand that she sha'n't turn me over to her grandmother"  We came home very safe and thus ended this so long projected and most disagreeable affair  LETTER V  Evelina in continuation  I HAVE just received a most affecting letter from Mr Macartney I will inclose it my dear Sir for your perusal More than ever have I cause to rejoice that I was able to assist him  Mr Macartney to Miss Anville  Madam  IMPRESSED with the deepest the most heartfelt sense of the exalted humanity with which you have rescued from destruction an unhappy stranger allow me with the humblest gratitude to offer you my fervent acknowledgments and to implore your pardon for the terror I have caused you  You bid me Madam live I have now indeed a motive for life since I should not willingly  quit the world while I withhold from the needy and distressed any share of that charity which a disposition so noble would otherwise bestow upon them  The benevolence with which you have interested yourself in my concerns induces me to suppose you would wish to be acquainted with the cause of that desperation from which you snatched me and the particulars of that misery of which you have so wonderfully been a witness Yet as this explanation will require that I should divulge secrets of a nature the most delicate I must entreat you to regard them as sacred even though I forbear to mention the names of the parties concerned  I was brought up in Scotland though my mother who had the sole care of me was an Englishman and had not one relation in that country She devoted to me her whole time The retirement in which we lived and the distance from our natural friends she often told me were the effect of an unconquerable melancholy with which she was seized upon the sudden loss of my father some time before I was born  At Aberdeen where I finished my education I formed a friendship with a young man of fortune which I considered as the chief happiness of my lifebut when he quitted his studies I considered it as my chief misfortune for he immediately prepared by direction of his friends to make the tour of Europe For my part designed for the church and with no prospect even of maintenance but from my own industry I scarce dared permit even a wish of accompanying him It is true he would joyfully have borne my expences but my affection was as free from meanness as his own and I made a determination the most solemn never  to lessen its dignity by submitting to pecuniary obligations  We corresponded with great regularity and the most unbounded confidence for the space of two years when he arrived at Lyons in his way home He wrote me thence the most pressing invitation to meet him at Paris where he intended to remain for some time My desire to comply with his request and shorten our absence was so earnest that my mother too indulgent to controul me lent me what assistance was in her power and in an illfated moment I set out for that capital  My meeting with this dear friend was the happiest event of my life he introduced me to all his acquaintance and so quickly did time seem to pass at that delightful period that the six weeks I had allotted for my stay were gone ere I was sensible I had missed so many days But I must now own that the company of my friend was not the sole subject of my felicity I became acquainted with a young lady daughter of an Englishman of distinction with whom I formed an attachment which I have a thousand times vowed a thousand times sincerely thought would be lasting as my life She had but just quitted a convent in which she had been placed when a child and though English by birth she could scarcely speak her native language Her person and disposition were equally engaging but chiefly I adored her for the greatness of the expectations which for my sake she was willing to resign  When the time for my residence in Paris expired I was almost distracted at the idea of quitting it yet I had not the courage to make our attachment known to her father who might reasonably form for her such views as would make him reject with a contempt which I could not bear to  think of such an offer as mine Yet I had free access to the house where she seemed to be left almost wholly to the guidance of an old servant who was my fast friend  But to be brief the sudden and unexpected return of her father one fatal afternoon proved the beginning of the misery which has ever since devoured me I doubt not but he had listened to our conversation for he darted into the room with the rage of a madman Heavens what a scene followedwhat abusive language did the shame of a clandestine affair and the consciousness of acting ill induce me to brook At length however his fury exceeded my patiencehe called me a beggarly cowardly Scotchman Fired at the words I drew my sword he with equal alertness drew his for he was not an old man but on the contrary strong and able as myself In vain his daughter pleadedin vain did I repentant of my anger retreathis reproaches continued myself my country were loaded with infamytill no longer constraining my ragewe foughtand he fell  At that moment I could almost have destroyed myself The young lady fainted with terror the old servant drawn to us by the noise of the scuffle entreated me to escape and promised to bring intelligence of what should pass to my apartment The disturbance which I heard raised in the house obliged me to comply and in a state of mind inconceivably wretched I tore myself away  My friend who I found at home soon discovered the whole affair It was near midnight ere the woman came She told me that her master was living and her young mistress restored to her senses The absolute necessity for my leaving Paris while any danger remained was forcibly urged by  my friend the servant promised to acquaint him of whatever passed and he to transmit to me her information Thus circumstanced with the assistance of this dear friend I effected my departure from Paris and not long after I returned to Scotland I would fain have stopped by the way that I might have been nearer the scene of all my concerns but the low state of my finances denied me that satisfaction  The miserable situation of my mind was soon discovered by my mother nor would she rest till I communicated the cause She heard my whole story with an agitation which astonished methe  name  of the parties concerned seemed to strike her with horrorbut when I said  We fought and he fell    "My son"  cried she  "you have then murdered your father"  and she sunk breathless at my feet Comments Madam upon such a scene as this would to you be superfluous and to me agonizing I cannot for both our sakes be too concise When she recovered she confessed all the particulars of a tale which she had hoped never to have revealedAlas the loss she had sustained of my father was not by deathbound to her by no ties but those of honour he had voluntarily deserted herHer settling in Scotland was not the effect of choiceshe was banished thither by a family but too justly incensedpardon Madam that I cannot be more explicit  My senses in the greatness of my misery actually forsook me and for more than a week I was wholly delirious My unfortunate mother was yet more to be pitied for she pined with unmitigated sorrow eternally reproaching herself for the danger to which her too strict silence had exposed me When I recovered my reason my impatience to  hear from Paris almost deprived me of it again and though the length of time I waited for letters might justly be attributed to contrary winds I could not bear the delay and was twenty times upon the point of returning thither at all hazards At length however several letters arrived at once and from the most insupportable of my afflictions I was then relieved for they acquainted me that the horrors of parricide were not in reserve for me They informed me also that as soon as the wound was healed a journey would be made to England where my unhappy  sister  was to be received by an aunt with whom she was to live  This intelligence somewhat quieted the violence of my sorrows I instantly formed a plan of meeting them in London and by revealing the whole dreadful story convincing this irritated parent that he had nothing more to apprehend from his daughter's unfortunate choice My mother consented and gave me a letter to prove the truth of my assertions As I could but ill afford to make this journey I travelled in the cheapest way that was possible I took an obscure lodging I need not Madam tell you whereand boarded with the people of the house  Here I languished week after week vainly hoping for the arrival of my  family  but my impetuosity had blinded me to the imprudence of which I was guilty in quitting Scotland so hastily My wounded father after his recovery relapsed and when I had waited in the most comfortless situation for six weeks my friend wrote me word that the journey was yet deferred for some time longer  My finances were then nearly exhausted and I was obliged though most unwillingly to beg further assistance from my mother that I might return  to Scotland Oh Madammy answer was not from herselfit was written by a lady who had long been her companion and acquainted me that she had been taken suddenly ill of a feverand was no more  The compassionate nature of which you have given such noble proofs assures me I need not if I could paint to you the anguish of a mind overwhelmed with such accumulated sorrows  Inclosed was a letter to a near relation which she had during her illness with much difficulty written and in which with the strongest maternal tenderness she described my deplorable situation and entreated his interest to procure me some preferment Yet so sunk was I by misfortune that a fortnight elapsed ere I had the courage or spirit to attempt delivering this letter I was then compelled to it by want To make my appearance with some decency I was necessitated myself to the melancholy task of changing my coloured cloaths for a suit of mourningand then I proceeded to seek my relation  I was informed that he was not in town  In this desperate situation the pride of my heart which hitherto had not bowed to adversity gave way and I determined to entreat the assistance of my friend whose offered services I had a thousand times rejected Yet Madam so hard is it to root from the mind its favourite principles or prejudices call them which you please that I lingered another week ere I had the resolution to send away a letter which I regarded as the death of my independence  At length reduced to my last shilling dunned insolently by the people of the house and almost famished I sealed this fatal letter and with a heavy heart determined to take it to the postoffice  But Mr Branghton and his son suffered me not to pass through their shop with impunity they insulted me grossly and threatened me with imprisonment if I did not immediately satisfy their demands Stung to the soul I bid them have but a day's patience and flung from them in a state of mind too terrible for description  My letter which I now found would be received too late to save me from disgrace I tore into a thousand pieces and scarce could I refrain from putting an instantaneous an unlicensed period to my existence  In this disorder of my senses I formed the horrible plan of turning footpad for which purpose I returned to my lodging and collected whatever of my apparel I could part with which I immediately sold and with the profits purchased a brace of pistols powder and shot I hope however you will believe me when I most solemnly assure you my sole intention was to  frighten  the passengers I should assault with these dangerous weapons which I had not loaded but from a resolutiona dreadful one I ownto save  myself  from an ignominious death if seized And indeed I thought if I could but procure money sufficient to pay Mr Branghton and make a journey to Scotland I should soon be able by the public papers to discover whom I had injured and to make private retribution  But Madam new to every species of villany my perturbation was so great that I could with difficulty support myself yet the Branghtons observed it not as I passed through the shop  Here I stop what followed is better known to yourself But no time can ever efface from my memory that moment when in the very action of preparing for my own destruction or the lawless  seizure of the property of others you rushed into the room and arrested my armIt was indeed an awful momentthe hand of Providence seemed to intervene between me and eternity I beheld you as an angelI thought you dropt from the cloudsthe earth indeed had never before presented to my view a form so celestialWhat wonder then that a spectacle so astonishing should to a man disordered as I was appear too beautiful to be human  And now Madam that I have performed this painful task the more grateful one remains of rewarding as far as is in my power your generous goodness by assuring you it shall not be thrown away You have awakened me to a sense of the false pride by which I have been actuateda pride which while it scorned assistance from a friend scrupled not to compel it from a stranger though at the hazard of reducing that stranger to a situation as destitute as my own Yet Oh how violent was the struggle which tore my conflicting soul ere I could persuade myself to profit by the benevolence which you were so evidently disposed to exert in my favour  By means of a ring the gift of my muchregretted mother I have for the present satisfied Mr Branghton and by means of your compassion I hope to support myself either till I hear from my friend to whom at length I have written or till the relation of my mother returns to town  To talk to you Madam of paying my debt would be vain I never can the service you have done me exceeds all power of return you have restored me to my senses you have taught me to curb those passions which bereft me of them and since I cannot avoid calamity to bear it as a man An interposition so wonderfully circumstanced can  never be recollected without benefit Yet allow me to say the pecuniary part of my obligation must be settled by my first ability  I am Madam with the most profound respect and heartfelt gratitude  Your obedient and devoted humble servant J MACARTNEY  LETTER VI  Evelina in continuation  Holborn  July o'clock in the morn  O SIR what an adventure have I to writeall night it has occupied my thoughts and I am now risen thus early to write it to you  Yesterday it was settled that we should spend the evening in Marybonegardens where M Torre a celebrated foreigner was to exhibit some fireworks The party consisted of Madame Duval all the Branghtons M Du Bois Mr Smith and Mr Brown  We were almost the first persons who entered the Gardens Mr Branghton having declared he would have  all he could get for his money  which at best was only fooled away at such silly and idle places  We walked in parties and very much detached from one another Mr Brown and Miss Polly led the way by themselves Miss Branghton and Mr Smith followed and the latter seemed determined to be revenged for my behaviour at the ball by transferring all his former attention for me to Miss Branghton who received it with an air of exultation  and very frequently they each of them though from different motives looked back to discover whether I observed their good intelligence Madame Duval walked with M Du Bois and Mr Branghton by himself but his son would willingly have attached himself wholly to me saying frequently  "Come Miss let's you and I have a little fun together you see they have all left us so now let us leave them"  But I begged to be excused and went to the other side of Madame Duval  This Garden as it is called is neither striking for magnificence nor for beauty and we were all so dull and languid that I was extremely glad when we were summoned to the orchestra upon the opening of a concert in the course of which I had the pleasure of hearing a concerto on the violin by Mr Barthelemon who to me seems a player of exquisite fancy feeling and variety  When notice was given us that the fireworks were preparing we hurried along to secure good places for the sight but very soon we were so encircled and incommoded by the crowd that Mr Smith proposed the  ladies  should make interest for a form to stand upon this was soon effected and the men then left us to accommodate themselves better saying they would return the moment the exhibition was over  The firework was really beautiful and told with wonderful ingenuity the story of Orpheus and Eurydice but at the moment of the fatal look which separated them for ever there was such an explosion of fire and so horrible a noise that we all as of one accord jumpt hastily from the form and ran away some paces fearing that we were in danger of mischief from the innumerable sparks of fire which glittered in the air  For a moment or two I neither knew nor considered whither I had run but my recollection was soon awakened by a stranger's addressing me with  "Come along with me my dear and I'll take care of you"  I started and then to my great terror perceived that I had outrun all my companions and saw not one human being I knew with all the speed in my power and forgetful of my first fright I hastened back to the place I had leftbut found the form occupied by a new set of people  In vain from side to side I looked for some face I knew I found myself in the midst of a crowd yet without party friend or acquaintance I walked in disordered haste from place to place without knowing which way to turn or whither I went Every other moment I was spoken to by some bold and unfeeling man to whom my distress which I think must be very apparent only furnished a pretence for impertinent witticisms or free gallantry  At last a young officer marching fiercely up to me said  "You are a sweet pretty creature and I enlist you in my service"  and then with great violence he seized my hand I screamed aloud with fear and forcibly snatching it away I ran hastily up to two ladies and cried  "For Heaven's sake dear ladies afford me some protection"  They heard me with a loud laugh but very readily said  "Ay let her walk between us"  and each of them took hold of an arm  Then in a drawling ironical tone of voice they asked  what had frightened my little Ladyship  I told them my adventure very simply and entreated  they would have the goodness to assist me in finding my friends  O yes to be sure they said I should not want for friends whilst I was with them Mine I said would be very grateful for any civilities with which they might favour me But imagine my dear Sir how I must be confounded when I observed that every other word I spoke produced a loud laugh However I will not dwell upon a conversation which soon to my inexpressible horror convinced me I had sought protection from insult of those who were themselves most likely to offer it You my dearest Sir I well know will both feel for and pity my terror which I have no words to describe  Had I been at liberty I should have instantly run away from them when I made the shocking discovery but as they held me fast that was utterly impossible and such was my dread of their resentment or abuse that I did not dare to make any open attempt to escape  They asked me a thousand questions accompanied by as many hallows of who I was what I was and whence I came My answers were very incoherentbut what good Heaven were my emotions when a few moments afterwards I perceived advancing our way Lord Orville  Never shall I forget what I felt at that instant had I indeed been sunk to the guilty state which such companions might lead him to suspect I could scarce have had feelings more cruelly depressing  However to my infinite joy he passed us without distinguishing me though I saw that in a careless manner his eyes surveyed the party  As soon as he was gone one of these unhappy women said  "Do you know that young fellow"  Not thinking it possible she should mean Lord Orville by such a term I readily answered  ""No Madam"  "Why then"  answered she  "you have a monstrous good stare for a little country Miss"  I now found I had mistaken her but was glad to avoid an explanation  A few minutes after what was my delight to hear the voice of Mr Brown who called out  "Lord i'n't that Miss what's her name"  "Thank God"  cried I suddenly springing from them both  "thank God I have found my party  Mr Brown was however alone and without knowing what I did I took hold of his arm  "Lord Miss cried he we've had such a hunt you can't think some of them thought you was gone home but I says says I I don't think says I that she'll like to go home all alone says I"  "So that gentleman belongs to you Miss does he"  said one of the women  Yes Madam"  answered I  "and I now thank you for your civility but as I am safe will not give you any further trouble"  I courtsied slightly and would have walked away but most unfortunately Madame Duval and the two Miss Branghtons just then joined us  They all began to make a thousand enquiries to which I briefly answered that I had been obliged to these two ladies for walking with me and would tell them more another time for though I felt great  comparative  courage I was yet too much intimidated by their presence to dare be explicit  Nevertheless I ventured once more to wish them good night and proposed seeking Mr Branghton These unhappy women listened to all that was said with a kind of callous curiosity and seemed determined not to take any hint But my vexation was terribly augmented when after having whispered something to each other they very cavalierly declared that they intended joining our party and then one of them very boldly took hold of my arm while the other going round seized that of Mr Brown and thus almost forcibly we were moved on between them and followed by Madame Duval and the Miss Branghtons  It would be very difficult to say which was greatest my fright or Mr Brown's consternation who ventured not to make the least resistance though his uneasiness made him tremble almost as much as myself I would instantly have withdrawn my arm but it was held so tight I could not move it and poor Mr Brown was circumstanced in the same manner on the other side for I heard him say  "Lord Ma'am there's no need to squeeze one's arm so"  And this was our situationfor we had not taken three steps whenO Sirwe again met Lord Orvillebut not again did he pass quietly by usunhappily I caught his eyeboth mine immediately were bent to the ground but he approached me and we all stopped  I then looked up He bowed Good God with what expressive eyes did he regard me Never were surprise and concern so strongly markedyes my dear Sir he looked  greatly  concerned and that the remembrance of that is the only consolation I feel for an evening the most painful of my life  What he first said I know not for indeed I seemed to have neither ears nor understanding but I recollect that I only courtsied in silence He paused for an instant as ifI believe soas if unwilling to pass on but then finding the whole party detained he again bowed and took leave  Indeed my dear Sir I thought I should have fainted so great was my emotion from shame vexation and a thousand other feelings for which I have no expressions I absolutely tore myself from the woman's arm and then disengaging myself from that of Mr Brown I went to Madame Duval and besought that she would not suffer me to be again parted from her  I fancythat Lord Orville saw what passed for scarcely was I at liberty ere he returned Methought my dear Sir the pleasure the surprise of that moment recompensed me for all the chagrin I had before felt for do you not think that this return manifests from a character so quiet so reserved as Lord Orville's something like solicitude in my concernssuch at least was the interpretation I involuntarily made upon again seeing him  With a politeness to which I have been some time very little used he apologised for returning and then enquired after the health of Mrs Mirvan and the rest of the Howard Grove family The flattering conjecture which I have just acknowledged had so wonderfully restored my spirits that I believe I never answered him so readily and with so little constraint Very short however was the duration of this conversation for we were soon most disagreeably interrupted  The Miss Branghtons though they saw almost immediately the characters of the women to whom I had so unfortunately applied were nevertheless  so weak and foolish as merely to  titter  at their behaviour As to Madame Duval she was really for some time so strangely imposed upon that she thought they were two real fine ladies Indeed it is wonderful to see how easily and how frequently she is deceived our disturbance however arose from young Brown who was now between the two women by whom his arms were absolutely pinioned to his sides for a few minutes his complaints had been only murmured but he now called out aloud  "Goodness Ladies you hurt me like any thing why I can't walk at all if you keep pinching my arms so"  This speech raised a loud laugh in the women and redoubled the tittering of the Miss Branghton's For my own part I was most cruelly confused while the countenance of Lord Orville manifested a sort of indignant astonishment and from that moment he spoke to me no more till he took leave  Madame Duval who now began to suspect her company proposed our taking the first box we saw empty bespeaking a supper and waiting till Mr Branghton should find us  Miss Polly mentioned one she had remarked to which we all turned Madame Duval instantly seated herself and the two bold women forcing the frightened Mr Brown to go between them followed her example  Lord Orville with an air of gravity that wounded my very soul then wished me good night I said not a word but my face if it had any connection with my heart must have looked melancholy indeed and so I have some reason to believe it did for he added with much more softness though not less dignity  "Will Miss Anville  allow me to ask her address and to pay my respects to her before I leave town"  O how I changed colour at this unexpected requestyet what was the mortification I suffered in answering  "My Lord I amin Holborn"  He then bowed and left us  What what can he think of this adventure how strangely how cruelly have all appearances turned against me Had I been blessed with any presence of mind I should instantly have explained to him the accident which occasioned my being in such terrible companybut I have none  As to the rest of the evening I cannot relate the particulars of what passed for to you I only write of what I think and I can think of nothing but this unfortunate this disgraceful meeting These two poor women continued to torment us all but especially poor Mr Brown who seemed to afford them uncommon diversion till we were discovered by Mr Branghton who very soon found means to release us from their persecutions by frightening them away We stayed but a short time after they left us which was all employed in explanations  Whatever may be the construction which Lord Orville may put upon this affair to me it cannot fail of being unfavourable to be seengracious Heavento be seen in company with two women of such characterHow vainly how proudly have I wished to avoid meeting him when only with the Branghtons and Madame Duvalbut now how joyful should I be had he seen me to no greater disadvantageHolborn too what a directionhe who had alwaysbut I will not torment you my dearest Sir with any more of my mortifying conjectures and apprehensions perhaps he may calland then I shall have an opportunity  of explaining to him all the most shocking part of the adventure And yet as I did not tell him at whose house I lived he may not be able to discover me I merely said  in Holborn  and he who I suppose saw my embarrassment forbore to ask any other direction  Well I must take my chance  Yet let me in justice to Lord Orville and in justice to the high opinion I have always entertained of his honour and delicacylet me observe the difference of his behaviour when nearly in the same situation to that of Sir Clement Willoughby He had at least equal cause to depreciate me in his opinion and to mortify and sink me in my own but far different was his conductperplexed indeed he looked and much surprisedbut it was benevolently not with insolence I am even inclined to think that he could not see a young creature whom he had so lately known in a higher sphere appear so suddenly so strangely so disgracefully altered in her situation without some pity and concern But whatever might be his doubts and suspicions far from suffering them to influence his behaviour he spoke he looked with the same politeness and attention with which he had always honoured me when countenanced by Mrs Mirvan  Once again let me drop this subject  In every mortification every disturbance how grateful to my heart how sweet to my recollection in the certainty of your neverfailing tenderness sympathy and protection Oh Sir could I upon this subject could I write as I feelhow animated would be the language of  Your devoted EVELINA  LETTER VII  Evelina to the Rev Mr Villars  Holborn  July  LISTLESS uneasy and without either spirit or courage to employ myself from the time I had finished my last letter I indolently seated myself at the window where while I waited Madame Duval's summons to breakfast I perceived among the carriages which passed by a coronet coach and in a few minutes from the window of it Lord Orville I instantly retreated but not I believe unseen for the coach immediately drove up to our door  Indeed my dear Sir I must own I was greatly agitated the idea of receiving Lord Orville by myselfthe knowledge that his visit was entirely to  me  the wish of explaining the unfortunate adventure of yesterdayand the mortification of my present circumstancesall these thoughts occurring to me nearly at the same time occasioned me more anxiety confusion and perplexity than I can possibly express  I believe he meant to send up his name but the maid unused to such a ceremony forgot it by the way and only told me that a great Lord was below and desired to see me and the next moment he appeared himself  If formerly when in the circle of high life and accustomed to its manners I so much admired and distinguished the grace the elegance of Lord Orville think Sir how they must strike me nownow when far removed from that splendid circle I live with those to whom even civility is unknown and decorum a stranger  I am sure I received him very awkwardly depressed by a situation so disagreeable could I do otherwise When his first enquiries were made  "I think myself very fortunate"  he said  "in meeting with Miss Anville at home and still more so in finding her disengaged"  I only courtsied He then talked of Mrs Mirvan asked how long I had been in town and other such general questions which happily gave me time to recover from my embarrassment After which he said  "If Miss Anville will allow me the honour of sitting by her a few minutes "for we were both standing" I will venture to tell her the motive which next to enquiring after her health has prompted me to wait on her thus early"  We were then both seated and after a short pause he said  "How to apologize for so great a liberty as I am upon the point of taking I know not shall I therefore rely wholly upon your goodness and not apologize at all"  I only bowed  "I should be extremely sorry to appear impertinentyet hardly know how to avoid it  "Impertinent O my Lord"  cried I eagerly  "that I am sure is impossible"  "You are very good"  answered he  "and encourage me to be ingenuous"  Again he stopped but my expectation was too great for speech at last without looking at me in a low voice and hesitating manner he said  "Were those Ladies with whom I saw you last night ever in your company before"  "No my Lord"  cried I rising and colouring violently  "nor will they ever be again"  He rose too and with an air of the most condescending concern said  "Pardon Madam the  abruptness of a question which I knew not how to introduce as I ought and for which I have no excuse to offer but my respect for Mrs Mirvan joined to the sincerest wishes for your happiness yet I fear I have gone too far"  "I am very sensible of the honour of your Lordship's attention"  said I  "but"  "Permit me to assure you"  cried he finding I hesitated  "that officiousness is not my characteristic and that I would by no means have risked your displeasure had I not been fully satisfied you were too generous to be offended without a real cause of offence"  "Offended"  cried I  no my Lord I am only grievedgrieved indeed to find myself in a situation so unfortunate as to be obliged to make explanations which cannot but mortify and shock me"  "It is I alone"  cried he with some eagerness  "who am shocked as it is I who deserve to be mortified I seek no explanation for I have no doubt but in mistaking me Miss Anville injures herself allow me therefore frankly and openly to tell you the intention of my visit"  I bowed and we both returned to our seats  "I will own myself to have been greatly surprised"  continued he  "when I met you yesterday evening in company with two persons who I was sensible merited not the honour of your notice nor was it easy for me to conjecture the cause of your being so situated yet believe me my incertitude did not for a moment do you injury I was satisfied that their characters must be unknown to you and I thought with concern of the shock you would sustain when you discovered their unworthiness I should not however upon so short an acquaintance have  usurped the privilege of intimacy in giving my unasked sentiments upon so delicate a subject had I not known that credulity is the sister of innocence and therefore feared you might be deceived A something which I could not resist urged me to the freedom I have taken to caution you but I shall not easily forgive myself if I have been so unfortunate as to give you pain"  The pride which his first question had excited now subsided into delight and gratitude and I instantly related to him as well as I could the accident which had occasioned my joining the unhappy women with whom he had met me He listened with an attention so flattering seemed so much interested during the recital and when I had done thanked me in terms so polite for what he was pleased to call my condescension that I was almost ashamed either to look at or hear him  Soon after the maid came to tell me that Madame Duval desired to have breakfast made in her own room  "I fear"  cried Lord Orville instantly rising  "that I have intruded upon your timeyet who so situated could do otherwise"  Then taking my hand  "Will Miss Anville allow me thus to seal my peace"  He pressed it to his lips and took leave  Generous noble Lord Orville how disinterested his conduct how delicate his whole behaviour willing to advise yet afraid to wound meCan I ever in future regret the adventure I met with at Marybone since it has been productive of a visit so flattering Had my mortifications been still more humiliating my terrors still more alarming such a mark of esteemmay I  not call it sofrom Lord Orville would have made me ample amends  And indeed my dear Sir I require some consolation in my present very disagreeable situation for since he went two incidents have happened that had not my spirits been particularly elated would greatly have disconcerted me  During breakfast Madame Duval very abruptly asked if I should like to be married and added that Mr Branghton had been proposing a match for me with his son Surprised and I must own provoked I assured her that in thinking of me Mr Branghton would very vainly lose his time  "Why"  cried she  "I have had grander views for you myself if once I could get you to Paris and make you be owned but if I can't do that and you can do no better why as you are both my relations I think to leave my fortune between you and then if you marry you never need want for nothing"  I begged her not to pursue the subject as I assured her Mr Branghton was totally disagreeable to me but she continued her admonitions and reflections with her usual disregard of whatever I could answer She charged me very peremptorily neither wholly to discourage nor yet to accept Mr Branghton's offer till she saw what could be done for me the young man she added had often intended to speak to me himself but not well knowing how to introduce the subject he had desired her to pave the way for him  I scrupled not warmly and freely to declare my aversion to this proposal but it was to no effect as she concluded just as she had begun by saying that I should not  have him if I could do better  Nothing however shall persuade me to listen to any other person concerning this odious affair  My second cause of uneasiness arises very unexpectedly from M Du Bois who to my infinite surprise upon Madame Duval's quitting the room after dinner put into my hand a note and immediately left the house  This note contains an open declaration of an attachment to me which he says he should never have presumed to have acknowledged had he not been informed that Madame Duval destined my hand to young Branghtona match which he cannot endure to think of He beseeches me earnestly to pardon his temerity professes the most inviolable respect and commits his fate to time patience and pity  This conduct in M Du Bois gives me real concern as I was disposed to think very well of him It will not however be difficult to discourage him and therefore I shall not acquaint Madame Duval of his letter as I have reason to believe it would greatly displease her  LETTER VIII  Evelina in continuation  July  O SIR how much uneasiness must I suffer to counterbalance one short morning of happiness  Yesterday the Branghtons proposed a party to Kensingtongardens and as usual Madame Duval insisted upon my attendance  We went in a hackneycoach to Piccadilly and then had a walk through Hyde Park which in any other company would have been delightful I  was much pleased with Kensingtongardens and think them infinitely preferable to those of Vauxhall  Young Branghton was extremely troublesome he insisted upon walking by my side and talked with me almost by compulsion however my reserve and coldness prevented his entering upon the hateful subject which Madame Duval had prepared me to apprehend Once indeed when I was accidentally a few yards before the rest he said  "I suppose Miss aunt has told you about you know whatha'n't she Miss"  But I turned from him without making any answer Neither Mr Smith nor Mr Brown were of the party and poor M Du Bois when he found that I avoided him looked so melancholy that I was really sorry for him  While we were strolling round the garden I perceived walking with a party of ladies at some distance Lord Orville I instantly retreated behind Miss Branghton and kept out of sight till we had passed him for I dreaded being seen by him again in a public walk with a party of which I was ashamed  Happily I succeeded in my design and saw no more of him for a sudden and violent shower of rain made us all hasten out of the gardens We ran till we came to a small greenshop where we begged shelter Here we found ourselves in company with two footmen whom the rain had driven into the shop Their livery I thought I had before seen and upon looking from the window I perceived the same upon a coachman belonging to a carriage which I immediately recollected to be Lord Orville's  Fearing to be known I whispered Miss Branghton not to speak my name Had I considered but  a moment I should have been sensible of the inutility of such a caution since not one of the party call me by any other appellation than that of  Cousin  or of  Miss  but I am perpetually involved in some distress or dilemma from my own heedlessness  This request excited very strongly her curiosity and she attacked me with such eagerness and bluntness of enquiry that I could not avoid telling her the reason of my making it and consequently that I was known to Lord Orville an acknowledgment which proved the most unfortunate in the world for she would not rest till she had drawn from me the circumstances attending my first making the acquaintance Then calling to her sister she said  "Lord Polly only think Miss has danced with a Lord"  "Well"  cried Polly  "that's a thing I should never have thought of And pray Miss what did he say to you"  This question was much sooner asked than answered and they both became so very inquisitive and earnest that they soon drew the attention of Madame Duval and the rest of the party to whom in a very short time they repeated all they had gathered from me  "Goodness then"  cried young Branghton  "if I was Miss if I would not make free with his Lordship's coach to take me to town"  "Why ay"  said the father  "there would be some sense in that that would be making some use of a Lord's acquaintance for it would save us coachhire"  "Lord Miss"  cried Polly  "I wish you would for I should like of all things to ride in a coronet coach"  "I promise you"  said Madame Duval  "I'm glad you've thought of it for I don't see no objectionso let's have the coachman called"  "Not for the world"  cried I very much alarmed  "indeed it is utterly impossible"  "Why so"  demanded Mr Branghton  "pray where's the good of your knowing a Lord if you're never the better for him"  "  Ma foi  child"  said Madame Duval  "you don't know no more of the world than if you was a baby Pray Sir to one of the footmen tell that coachman to draw up for I wants to speak to him"  The man stared but did not move  "Pray pray Madam"  said I  "pray Mr Branghton have the goodness to give up this plan I know but very little of his Lordship and cannot upon any account take so great a liberty"  "Don't say nothing about it"  said Madame Duval  "for I shall have it my own way so if  you  won't call the coachman Sir I'll promise you I'll call him myself"  The footman very impertinently laughed and turned upon his heel Madame Duval extremely irritated ran out in the rain and beckoned the coachman who instantly obeyed her summons Shocked beyond all expression I flew after her and entreated her with the utmost earnestness to let us return in a hackneycoachbut ohshe is impenetrable to persuasion She told the man she wanted him to carry her directly to town and that she would answer for him to Lord Orville The man with a sneer thanked her but said he should answer for himself and was driving off when another footman came up to him with information that his Lord was gone into Kensington palace and would not want him for an hour or two  "Why then friend  "said Mr Branghton for we were followed by all the party  "where will be the great harm of your taking us to town"  "Besides"  said the son  "I'll promise you a pot of beer for my own share"  These speeches had no other answer from the coachman than a loud laugh which was echoed by the insolent footmen I rejoiced at their resistance though I was certain that if their Lord had witnessed their impertinence they would have been instantly dismissed his service  "  Pardie  "  cried Madame Duval  "if I don't think all the footmen are the most impudentest fellows in the kingdom But I'll promise you I'll have your master told of your airs so you'll get no good by 'em"  "Why pray"  said the coachman rather alarmed  "did my Lord give you leave to use the coach"  "It's no matter for that"  answered she  "I'm sure if he's a gentleman he'd let us have it sooner than we should be wet to the skin but I'll promise you he shall know how saucy you've been for this young lady knows him very well"  "Ay that she does"  said Miss Polly  "and she's danced with him too  "Oh how I repented my foolish mismanagement The men bit their lips and looked at one another in some confusion This was perceived by our party who taking advantage of it protested they would write Lord Orville word of their ill behaviour without delay This quite startled them and one of the footmen offered to run to the palace and ask his Lord's permission for our having the carriage  This proposal really made me tremble and the Branghtons all hung back upon it but Madame  Duval is never to be dissuaded from a scheme she has once formed  "Do so"  cried she  "and give this child's compliments to your Master and tell him as we ha'n't no coach here we should be glad to go just as far as Holborn in his"  "No no no"  cried I  "don't goI know nothing of his LordshipI send no messageI have nothing to say to him"  The men very much perplexed could with difficulty restrain themselves from resuming their impertinent mirth Madame Duval scolded me very angrily and then desired them to go directly  "Pray then"  said the coachman  "what name is to be given to my Lord"  "Anville"  answered Madame Duval  "tell him Miss Anville wants the coach the young lady he danced with once"  I was really in an agony but the winds could not have been more deaf to me than those to whom I pleaded and therefore the footman urged by the repeated threats of Madame Duval and perhaps recollecting the name himself actually went to the palace with this strange message  He returned in a few minutes and bowing to me with the greatest respect said  "My Lord desires his compliments and his carriage will be always at Miss Anville's service"  I was so much affected by this politeness and chagrined at the whole affair that I could scarce refrain from tears Madame Duval and the Miss Branghtons eagerly jumped into the coach and desired me to follow I would rather have submitted to the severest punishmentbut all resistance was vain  During the whole ride I said not a word however the rest of the party were so talkative that my silence was very immaterial We stopped  at our lodgings but when Madame Duval and I alighted the Branghtons asked if they could not be carried on to SnowHill The servants now all civility made no objection Remonstrances from me would I too well kn  w be fruitless and therefore with a heavy heart I retired to my room and left them to their own direction  Seldom have I passed a night in greater uneasinessso lately to have cleared myself in the good opinion of Lord Orvilleso soon to forfeit itto give him reason to suppose I presumed to boast of his acquaintanceto publish his having danced with meto take with him a liberty I should have blushed to have taken with the most intimate of my friendsto treat with such impertinent freedom one who has honoured  me  with such distinguished respectindeed Sir I could have met with no accident that would so cruelly have tormented me  If such were then my feelings imaginefor I cannot describe what I suffered during the scene I am now going to write  This morning while I was alone in the diningroom young Branghton called He entered with a most important air and strutting up to me said  "Miss  Lord Orville  sends his compliments to you"  "Lord Orville"  repeated I much amazed  "Yes Miss Lord Orville for  I  know his Lordship now as well as youAnd a very civil gentleman he is for all he's a Lord"  "For Heaven's sake"  cried I  "explain yourself"  "Why you must know Miss after we lest you we met with a little misfortune but I don't mind it now for it's all turned out for the best but just as we were a going up SnowHill plump  we comes against a cart with such a jog it almost pulled the coachwheel off however that i'n't the worst for as I went to open the door in a hurry a thinking the coach would be broke down as illluck would have it I never minded that the glass was up and so I poked my head fairly through it Only see Miss how I've cut my forehead"  A much worse accident to himself would not I believe at that moment have given me any concern for him however he proceeded with his account for I was too much confounded to interrupt him  "Goodness Miss we were in such a stew us and the servants and all as you can't think for besides the glass being broke the coachman said how the coach would'n't be safe to go back to Kensington So we did n't know what to do however the footmen said they'd go and tell his Lordship what had happened So then father grew quite uneasy like for fear of his Lordship's taking offence and prejudicing us in our business so he said I should go this morning and ask his pardon 'cause of having broke the glass So then I asked the footman the direction and they told me he lived in Berkleysquare so this morning I went and I soon found out the house"  "You did"  cried I quite out of breath with apprehension  "Yes Miss and a very fine house it is Did you ever see it"  "No"  "Nowhy then Miss I know more of his Lordship than you do for all you knew him first So when I came to the door I was in a peck of troubles a thinking what I should say to him however the servants had no mind I should see  him for they told me he was busy but I might leave my message So I was just coming away when I bethought myself to say I come from you"  "From  me  "  "Yes Missfor you know why should I have such a long walk as that for nothing So I says to the porter says I tell his Lordship says I one wants to speak to him as comes from one Miss Anville says I"  "Good God"  cried I  "and by what authority did you take such a liberty"  "Goodness Miss don't be in such a hurry for you'll be as glad as me when you hear how well it all turned out So then they made way for me and said his Lordship would see me directly and there I was led through such a heap of servants and so many rooms that my heart quite misgave me for I thought thinks I he'll be so proud he'll hardly let me speak but he's no more proud than I am and he was as civil at if I'd been a lord myself So then I said I hoped he would n't take it amiss about the glass for it was quite an accident but he bid me not mention it for it did n't signify And then he said he hoped you got safe home and was n't frightened and so I said yes and I gave your duty to him"  "My duty to him"  exclaimed I  "and who gave you leavewho desired you"  "O I did it of my own head just to make him think I came from you But I should have told you before how the footman said he was going out of town tomorrow evening and that his sister was soon to be married and that he was a ordering a heap of things for that so it come into my head as he was so affable that I'd ask him for his custom So I says says I my Lord says I if your Lordship i'n't engaged particularly  my father is a silversmith and he'd be very proud to serve you says I and Miss Anville as danced with you is his cousin and she's my cousin too and she'd be very much obligated to you I'm sure"  "You'll drive me wild"  cried I starting from my seat  "you have done me an irreparable injurybut I will hear no more"  and then I ran into my own room  I was half frantic I really raved the good opinion of Lord Orville seemed now irretrievably lost a faint hope which in the morning I had vainly encouraged that I might see him again and explain the transaction wholly vanished now I found he was so soon to leave town and I could not but conclude that for the rest of my life he would regard me as an object of utter contempt  The very idea was a dagger to my heartI could not support it andbut I blush to proceedI fear your disapprobation yet I should not be conscious of having merited it but that the repugnance I feel to relate to you what I have done makes me suspect I must have erred Will you forgive me if I own that I have  first  written an account of this transaction to Miss Mirvanand that I even thought of  concealing  it from youShortlived however was the ungrateful idea and sooner will I risk the justice of your displeasure than unworthily betray your generous confidence  You are now probably prepared for what followswhich is a lettera hasty letter that in the height of my agitation I wrote to Lord Orville  To Lord Orville  My Lord  I am so infinitely ashamed of the application made yesterday for your Lordship's carriage in my name and so greatly shocked at hearing how much it was injured that I cannot forbear writing a few lines to clear myself from the imputation of an impertinence which I blush to be suspected of and to acquaint you that the request for your carriage was made against my consent and the visit with which you were importuned this morning without my knowledge  I am inexpressibly concerned at having been the instrument however innocently of so much trouble to your Lordship but I beg you to believe that reading these lines is the only part of it which I have given voluntarily  I am my Lord Your Lordship's most humble servant EVELINA ANVILLE  I applied to the maid of the house to get this note conveyed to Berkeleysquare but scarce had I parted with it ere I regretted having written at all and I was flying down stairs to recover it when the voice of Sir Clement Willoughby stopped me As Madame Duval had ordered we should be denied to him I was obliged to return up stairs and after he was gone my application was too late as the maid had given it to a porter  My time did not pass very serenely while he was gone however he brought me no answer but that Lord Orville was not at home Whether  or not he will take the trouble to send anyor whether he will condescend to callor whether the affair will rest as it is I know notbut in being ignorant am most cruelly anxious  LETTER IX  Evelina in continuation  July  YOU may now my dear Sir send Mrs Clinton for your Evelina with as much speed as she can conveniently make the journey for no further opposition will be made to her leaving this town happy had it perhaps been for her had she never entered it  This morning Madame Duval desired me to go to Snowhill with an invitation to the Branghtons and Mr Smith to spend the evening with her and she desired M Du Bois who breakfasted with us to accompany me I was very unwilling to obey her as I neither wished to walk with M Du Bois nor yet to meet young Branghton And indeed another a yet more powerful reason added to my reluctancefor I thought it possible that Lord Orville might send some answer or perhaps might call during my absence however I did not dare dispute her commands  Poor M Du Bois spoke not a word during our walk which was I believe equally unpleasant to us both We found all the family assembled in the shop Mr Smith the moment he perceived  me addressed himself to Miss Branghton whom he entertained with all the gallantry in his power I rejoice to find that my conduct at the Hampstead ball has had so good an effect But young Branghton was extremely troublesome he repeatedly laughed in my face and looked so impertinently significant that I was obliged to give up my reserve to M Du Bois and enter into conversation with him merely to avoid such boldness  "Miss"  said Mr Branghton  "I'm sorry to hear from my son that you was n't pleased with what we did about that Lord Orville but I should like to know what it was you found fault with for we did all for the best"  "Goodness"  cried the son  "why if you'd seen Miss you'd have been surprisedshe went out of the room quite in a huff like"  "It is too late now"  said I  "to reason upon this subject but for the future I must take the liberty to request that my name may never be made use of without my knowledge May I tell Madame Duval that you will do her the favour to accept her invitation"  "As to me Ma'am"  said Mr Smith  "I am much obliged to the old lady but I've no mind to be taken in by her again you'll excuse me Ma'am"  All the rest promised to come and I then took leave but as I left the shop I heard Mr Branghton say  "Take courage Tom she's only coy"  And before I had walked ten yards the youth followed  I was so much offended that I would not look at him but began to converse with M Du Bois who was now more lively than I had ever before  seen him for most unfortunately he misinterpreted the reason of my attention to him  The first intelligence I received when I came home was that two gentlemen had called and left cards I eagerly enquired for them and read the names of Lord Orville and Sir Clement Willoughby I by no means regretted that I missed seeing the latter but perhaps I may all my life regret that I missed seeing the former for probably he has now left townand I may see him no more  "My goodness"  cried young Branghton rudely looking over me  "only think of that Lord's coming all this way It's my belief he'd got some order ready for father and so he'd a mind to call and ask you if I'd told him the truth"  "Pray Betty"  cried I  "how long has he been gone"  "Not two minutes Ma'am"  "Why then I'll lay you any wager"  said young Branghton  "he saw you and I awalking up Holborn Hill"  "God forbid"  cried I impatiently and too much chagrined to bear with any more of his remarks I ran up stairs but I heard him say to M Du Bois  "Miss is so  uppish  this morning that I think I had better not speak to her again"  I wish M Du Bois had taken the same resolution but he chose to follow me into the diningroom which we found empty  "  Vous ne l'aimez donc pas ce garcon Mademoiselle  "  cried he  "Me"  cried I  "no I detest him"  for I was quite sick at heart  "  Ah tu me rends la vie  "  cried he and slinging himself at my feet he had just caught  my hand as the door was opened by Madame Duval  Hastily and with marks of guilty confusion in his face he arose but the rage of that lady quite amazed me advancing to the retreating M Du Bois she began in French an attack which her extreme wrath and wonderful volubility almost rendered unintelligible yet I understood but too much since her reproaches convinced me she had herself proposed being the object of his affection  He defended himself in a weak and evasive manner and upon her commanding him from her sight very readily withdrew and then with yet greater violence she upbraided me with having  seduced  his heart called me an ungrateful designing girl and protested she would neither take me to Paris nor any more interest herself in my concerns unless I would instantly agree to marry young Branghton  Frightened as I had been at her vehemence this proposal restored all my courage and I frankly told her that in this point I never could obey her More irritated than ever she ordered me to quit the room  Such is the present situation of affairs I shall excuse myself from seeing the Branghtons this afternoon indeed I never wish to see them again I am sorry however innocently that I have displeased Madame Duval yet I shall be very glad to quit this town for I believe it does not now contain one person I ever wish to again meet Had I but seen Lord Orville I should regret nothing I could then have more fully explained what I so hastily wrote yet it will always be a pleasure to me to recollect that he called since I  flatter myself it was in consequence of his being satisfied with my letter  Adieu my dear Sir the time now approaches when I hope once more to receive your blessing and to owe all my joy all my happiness to your kindness  LETTER X  Mr Villars to Evelina  Berry Hill  July  WELCOME thrice welcome my darling Evelina to the arms of the truest the fondest of your friends Mrs Clinton who shall hasten to you with these lines will conduct you directly hither for I can consent no longer to be parted from the child of my bosomthe comfort of my agethe sweet solace of all my infirmities Your worthy friends at Howard Grove must pardon me that I rob them of the visit you purposed to make them before your return to Berry Hill for I find my fortitude unequal to a longer separation  I have much to say to you many comments to make upon your late letters some parts of which give me no little uneasiness but I will reserve my remarks for our future conversations Hasten then to the spot of thy nativity the abode of thy youth where never yet care or sorrow had power to annoy theeO that they might ever be banished this peaceful dwelling  Adieu my dearest Evelina I pray but that thy satisfaction at our approaching meeting may bear any comparison with mine  ARTHUR VILLARS  LETTER XI  Evelina to Miss Mirvan  Berry Hill  July  MY sweet Maria will be much surprised and I am willing to flatter myself concerned when instead of her friend she receives this letterthis cold this inanimate letter which will but ill express the feelings of the heart which indites it  When I wrote to you last Friday I was in hourly expectation of seeing Mrs Clinton with whom I intended to have set out for Howard Grove Mrs Clinton came but my plan was necessarily altered for she brought me a letterthe sweetest that ever was penned from the best and kindest friend that ever orphan was blest with requiring my immediate attendance at Berry Hill  I obeyedand pardon me if I own I obeyed without reluctance after so long a separation should I not else have been the most ungrateful of mortalsAnd yetoh Maria though I  wished  to leave London the gratification of my wish afforded me no happiness and though I felt an impatience inexpressible to return hither no words no language can explain the heaviness  of heart with which I made the journey I believe you would hardly have known meindeed I hardly know myself Perhaps had I first seen  you  in your kind and sympathising bosom I might have ventured to have reposed every secret of my soul and thenbut let me pursue my journal  Mrs Clinton delivered Madame Duval a letter from Mr Villars which requested her leave for my return and indeed it was very readily accorded yet when she found by my willingness to quit town that M Du Bois was really indifferent to me she somewhat softened in my favour and declared that but for punishing his folly in thinking of such a child she would not have consented to my being again buried in the country  All the Branghtons called to take leave of me but I will not write a word more about them indeed I cannot with any patience think of that family to whose forwardness and impertinence is owing all the uneasiness I at this moment suffer  So great was the depression of my spirits upon the road that it was with difficulty I could persuade the worthy Mrs Clinton I was not ill but alas the situation of my mind was such as would have rendered any mere bodily pain by comparison even enviable  And yet when we arrived at Berry Hillwhen the chaise stopped at this placehow did my heart throb with joy and when through the window I beheld the dearest the most venearble of men with uplifted hands returning as I doubt not thanks for my safe arrivalgood God I thought it would have burst my bosomI opened the chaisedoor myself I  flewfor my feet did not seem to touch the groundinto the parlour he had risen to meet me but the moment I appeared he sunk into his chair uttering with a deep sigh though his face  beamed  with delight  "My God I thank thee"  I sprung forward and with a pleasure that bordered upon agony I embraced his knees I kissed his hands I wept over them but could not speak while he now raising his eyes in thankfulness towards heaven now bowing down his reverend head and folding me in his arms could scarce articulate the blessings with which his kind and benevolent heart overflowed  O Miss Mirvan to be so beloved by the best of menshould I not be happyShould I have one wish save that of meriting his goodnessYet think me not ungrateful indeed I am not although the internal sadness of my mind unfits me at present for enjoying as I ought the bounties of Providence  I cannot journalise cannot arrange my ideas into order  How little has situation to do with happiness I had flattered myself that when restored to Berry Hill I should be restored to tranquility far otherwise have I found it for never yet had tranquility and Evelina so little intercourse  I blush for what I have written Can you Maria forgive my gravity but I restrain it so much and so painfully in the presence of Mr Villars that I know not how to deny myself the consolation of indulging it to you  Adieu my dear Miss Mirvan  Yet one thing I must add do not let the seriousness of this letter deceive you do not impute  to a wrong cause the melancholy I confess by supposing that the heart of your friend mourns a too great susceptibility no indeed believe me it never was never can be more assuredly her own than at this moment So witness in all truth  Your affectionate EVELINA  PS  You will make my excuses to the honoured Lady Howard and to your dear mother  LETTER XII  Evelina in continuation  Berry Hill  July  YOU accuse me of mystery and charge me with reserve I cannot doubt but I must have merited the accusationyet to clear myselfyou know not how painful will be the task But I cannot resist your kind entreatiesindeed I do not wish to resist them for your friendship and affection will soothe my chagrin Had it arisen from any other cause not a moment would I have deferred the communication you askbut as it is I would were it possible not only conceal it from all the world but endeavour to disbelieve it myself Yet since I  must  tell you why trifle with your impatience  I know not how to come to the point twenty times have I attempted it in vainbut I will  force  myself to proceed  Oh Miss Mirvan could you ever have believed that one who seemed formed as a pattern for his fellowcreatures as a model of perfectionone whose elegance surpassed all descriptionwhose sweetness of manners disgraced all comparisonOh Miss Mirvan could you ever have believed that  Lord Orville  would have treated me with indignity  Never never again will I trust to appearancesnever confide in my own weak judgmentnever believe that person to be good who seems to be amiable What cruel maxims are we taught by a knowledge of the worldBut while my own reflections absorb me I forget you are still in suspence  I had just finished the last letter which I wrote to you from London when the maid of the house brought me a note It was given to her she said by a footman who told her he would call the next day for an answer  This notebut let it speak for itself  To Miss Anville  With transport most charming of thy sex did I read the letter with which you yesterday morning favoured me I am sorry the affair of the carriage should have given you any concern but I am highly flattered by the anxiety you express so kindly Believe me my lovely girl I am truly sensible of the honour of your good opinion and feel myself deeply penetrated with love and gratitude The correspondence you have so sweetly commenced I shall be proud of continuing and I hope the strong sense I have or the favour you do me will prevent your withdrawing it Assure yourself that I desire nothing more ardently than to pour forth my thanks at your feet  and to offer those vows which are so justly the tribute of your charms and accomplishments In your next I entreat you to acquaint me how long you shall remain in town The servant whom I shall commission to call for an answer has orders to ride post with it to me My impatience for his arrival will be very great though inferior to that with which I burn to tell you in person how much I am my sweet girl  Your grateful admirer ORVILLE  What a letter how has my proud heart swelled every line I have copied What I wrote to him you know tell me then my dear friend do you think it merited such an answerand that I have deservedly incurred the liberty he has taken I meant nothing but a simple apology which I thought as much due to my own character as to his yet by the construction he seems to have put upon it should you not have imagined it contained the avowal of sentiments which might indeed have provoked his contempt  The moment the letter was delivered to me I retired to my own room to read it and so eager was my first perusal thatI am ashamed to own it gave me no sensation but of delight Unsuspicious of any impropriety from Lord Orville I perceived not immediately the impertinence it impliedI only marked the expressions of his own regard and I was so much surprised that I was unable for some time to compose myself or read it againI could only walk up and down the room repeating to myself  "Good God is it possibleam I then loved by Lord Orville"  But this dream was soon over and I awoke to far different feelings upon a second reading I thought every word changedit did not seem the  same letterI could not find one sentence that I could look at without blushing my astonishment was extreme and it was succeeded by the utmost indignation  If as I am very ready to acknowledge I erred in writing to Lord Orville was it for  him  to punish the error If he was offended could he not have been silent If he thought my letter illjudged should he not have pitied my ignorance have considered my youth and allowed for my inexperience  Oh Maria how have I been deceived in this man Words have no power to tell the high opinion I had of him to that was owing the unfortunate solicitude which prompted my writinga solicitude I must for ever repent  Yet perhaps I have rather reason to rejoice than to grieve since this affair has shewn me his real disposition and removed that partiality which covering his every imperfection left only his virtues and good qualities exposed to view Had the deception continued much longer had my mind received any additional prejudice in his favour who knows whither my mistaken ideas might have led me Indeed I fear I was in greater danger than I apprehended or can now think of without tremblingfor oh if this weak heart of mine had been penetrated with too deep an impression of his meritmy peace and happiness had been lost for ever  I would fain encourage more chearful thoughts fain drive from my mind the melancholy that has taken possession of itbut I cannot succeed for added to the humiliating feelings which so powerfully oppress me I have yet another cause of concernalas my dear Maria I have broken the tranquility of the best of men  I have never had the courage to shew him this cruel letter I could not bear so greatly to depreciate in his opinion one whom I had with infinite anxiety raised in it myself Indeed my first determination was to confine my chagrin totally to my own bosom but your friendly enquiries have drawn it from me and now I wish I had made no concealment from the beginning since I know not how to account for a gravity which not all my endeavours can entirely hide or repress  My greatest apprehensions is lest he should imagine that my residence in London has given me a distaste to the country Every body I see takes notice of my being altered and looking pale and ill I should be very indifferent to all such observations did I not perceive that they draw upon me the eyes of Mr Villars which glisten with affectionate concern  This morning in speaking of my London expedition he mentioned Lord Orville I felt so much disturbed that I would instantly have changed the subject but he would not allow me and very unexpectedly he began his panegyric extolling in strong terms his manly and honourable behaviour in regard to the Marybone adventure My cheeks glowed with indignation every word he spokeso lately as I had myself fancied him the noblest of his sex now that I was so well convinced of my mistake I could not bear to hear his undeserved praises uttered by one so really good so unsuspecting so pure of heart  What he thought of my silence and uneasiness I fear to know but I hope he will mention the subject no more I will not however with ungrateful indolence give way to a sadness which  I find infectious to him who merits the most chearful exertion of my spirits I am thankful that he has forborne to probe my wound and I will endeavour to heal it by the consciousness that I have not deserved the indignity I have received Yet I cannot but lament to find myself in a world so deceitful where we must suspect what we see distrust what we hear and doubt even what we feel  LETTER XIII  Evelina in continuation  Berry Hill  July  I MUST own myself somewhat distressed how to answer your raillery yet believe me my dear Maria your suggestions are those of  fancy  not of  truth  I am unconscious of the weakness you suspect yet to dispel your doubts I will animate myself more than ever to conquer my chagrin and to recover my spirits  You wonder you say since my  heart  takes no part in this affair why it should make me so unhappy And can you acquainted as you are with the high opinion I entertained of Lord Orville can you wonder that so great a disappointment in his character should affect me indeed had so strange a letter been sent to me from  any  body it could not have failed shocking me how much more sensibly then must I feel such an affront when received from the man in the  world I had imagined least capable of giving it  You are glad I made no reply assure yourself my dear friend had this letter been the most respectful that could be written the clandestine air given to it by his proposal of sending his servant for my answer instead of having it directed to his house would effectually have prevented my writing Indeed I have an aversion the most sincere to all mysteries all private actions however foolishly and blameably in regard to this letter I have deviated from the open path which from my earliest infancy I was taught to tread  He talks of my having  commenced a correspondence  with him and could Lord Orville indeed believe I had such a design believe me so forward so bold so strangely ridiculous I know not if his man called or not but I rejoice that I quitted London before he came and without leaving any message for him What indeed could I have said it would have been a condescension very unmerited to have taken any the least notice of such a letter  Never shall I cease to wonder how he could write it Oh Maria what what could induce him so causelessly to wound and affront one who would sooner have died than wilfully offend  him  How mortifying a freedom of style how cruel an implication conveyed by his  thanks  and expressions of gratitude Is it not astonishing that any man can  appear  so modest who is so vain  Every hour I regret the secrecy I have observed with my beloved Mr Villars I know not what bewitched me but I felt at first a repugnance to publishing this affair that I could not surmount  and now I am ashamed of confessing that I have any thing to confess Yet I deserve to be punished for the false delicacy which occasioned my silence since if Lord Orville himself was contented to forfeit his character was it for me almost at the expence of my own to support it  Yet I believe I should be very easy now the first shock is over and now that I see the whole affair with the resentment it merits did not all my good friends in this neighbourhood who think me extremely altered teaze me about my gravity and torment Mr Villars with observations upon my dejection and falling away The subject is no sooner started than a deep gloom overspreads his venerable countenance and he looks at me with a tenderness so melancholy that I know not how to endure the consciousness of exciting it  Mrs Selwyn a lady of large fortune who lives about three miles from Berry Hill and who has always honoured me with very distinguishing marks of regard is going in a short time to Bristol and has proposed to Mr Villars to take me with her for the recovery of my health He seemed very much distressed whether to consent or refuse but I without any hesitation warmly opposed the scheme protesting my health could no where be better than in this pure air He had the goodness to thank me for this readiness to stay with him but he is all goodness Oh that it were in my power to be indeed what in the kindness of his heart he has called me the comfort of his age and solace of his infirmities  Never do I wish to be again separated from him If here I am grave elsewhere I should be  unhappy In his presence with a very little exertion all the chearfulness of my disposition seems ready to return the benevolence of his countenance reanimates the harmony of his temper composes the purity of his character edifies me I owe to him every thing and far from finding my debt of gratitude a weight the first pride first pleasure of my life is the recollection of the obligations conferred upon me by a goodness so unequalled  Once indeed I thought there existed anotherwho when  time had wintered o'er his locks  would have shone forth among his fellowcreatures with the same brightness of worth which dignifies my honoured Mr Villars a brightness how superior in value to that which results from mere quickness of parts wit or imagination a brightness which not contented with merely diffusing smiles and gaining admiration from the sallies of the spirits reflects a real and a glorious lustre upon all mankind Oh how great was my error how ill did I judge how cruelly have I been deceived  I will not go to Bristol though Mrs Selwyn is very urgent with mebut I desire not to see any more of the world the few months I have already passed in it have sufficed to give me a disgust even to its name  I hope too I shall see Lord Orville no more accustomed from my first knowledge of him to regard him as a  being superior to his race  his presence perhaps might banish my resentment and I might forget his ill conductfor oh MariaI should not know how to see  Lord Orville  and to think of displeasure  As a sister I loved himI could have entrusted him with every thought of my heart had he  deigned to wish my confidence so steady did I think his honour so  feminine  his delicacy and so amiable his nature I have a thousand times imagined that the whole study of his life and whole purport of his reflections tended solely to the good and happiness of othersbut I will talkwritethink of him no more  Adieu my dear friend  LETTER XIV  Evelina in continuation  Berry Hill  August  YOU complain of my silence my dear Miss Mirvanbut what have I to write Narrative does not offer nor does a lively imagination supply the deficiency I have however at present sufficient matter for a letter in relating a conversation I had yesterday with Mr Villars  Our breakfast had been the most chearful we have had since my return hither and when it was over he did not as usual retire to his study but continued to converse with me while I worked We might probably have passed all the morning thus sociably but for the entrance of a farmer who came to solicit advice concerning some domestic affairs They withdrew together into the study  The moment I was alone my spirits failed me the exertion with which I had supported them had fatigued my mind I flung away my work  and leaning my arms on the table gave way to a train of disagreeable reflections which bursting from the restraint that had smothered them filled me with unusual sadness  This was my situation when looking towards the door which was open I perceived Mr Villars who was earnestly regarding me  "Is Farmer Smith gone Sir"  cried I hastily rising and snatching up my work  "Don't let me disturb you"  said he gravely  "I will go again to my study"  "Will you SirI was in hopes you were coming to sit here"  "In hopesand why Evelina should you hope it"  This question was so unexpected that I knew not how to answer it but as I saw he was moving away I followed and begged him to return  "No my dear no"  said he with a forced smile  "I only interrupt your meditations"  Again I knew not what to say and while I hesitated he retired My heart was with him but I had not the courage to follow The idea of an explanation brought on in so serious a manner frightened me I recollected the suspicion  you  had drawn from my uneasiness and I feared that he might make a similar interpretation  Solitary and thoughtful I passed the rest of the morning in my own room At dinner I again attempted to be chearful but Mr Villars himself was grave and I had not sufficient spirits to support a conversation merely by my own efforts As soon as dinner was over he took a book and I walked to the window I believe I remained near an hour in this situation All  my thoughts were directed to considering how I might dispel the doubts which I apprehended Mr Villars had formed without acknowledging a circumstance which I had suffered so much pain merely to conceal But while I was thus planning for the future I forgot the present and so intent was I upon the subject which occupied me that the strange appearance of my unusual inactivity and extreme thoughtfulness never occurred to me But when at last I recollected myself and turned round I saw that Mr Villars had parted with his book and was wholly engrossed in attending to me I started from my reverie and hardly knowing what I said asked if he had been reading  He paused a moment and then said  "Yes my childa book that both afflicts and perplexes me"  He means  me  thought I and therefore I made no answer  "What if we read it together"  continued he  "will you assist me to clear its obscurity"  I knew not what to say but I sighed involuntarily from the bottom of my heart He rose and approaching me said with emotion  "My child I can no longer be a silent witness of thy sorrowis not  thy  sorrow  my  sorrowand ought I to be a stranger to the cause when I so deeply sympathise in the effect"  "Cause Sir"  cried I greatly alarmed  "what causeI don't know I can't tellI"  "Fear not"  said he kindly  "to unbosom thyself to me my dearest Evelina open to me thy whole heartit can have no feelings  for which I will not make allowance Tell me therefore what it is that thus afflicts us both and who knows but I may suggest some means of relief"  "You are too too good"  cried I greatly embarrassed  "but indeed I know not what you mean"  "I see"  said he  "it is painful to you to speak suppose then I endeavour to save you by guessing"  "Impossible impossible"  cried I eagerly  "no one living could ever guess ever suppose"  I stopped abruptly for I then recollected I was acknowledging something  was  to be guessed however he noticed not my mistake  "At least let me try"  answered he mildly  "perhaps I may be a better diviner than you imagine if I guess every thing that is probable surely I must approach near the real reason Be honest then my love and speak without reservedoes not the country after so much gaiety so much variety does it not appear insipid and tiresome"  "No indeed" I love it more than ever and more than ever do I wish I had never never quitted it"  "Oh my child that I had not permitted the journey My judgment always opposed it but my resolution was not proof against persuasion"  "I blush indeed"  cried I  "to recollect my earnestnessbut I have been my own punisher"  "It is too late now"  answered he  "to reflect upon this subject let us endeavour to avoid repentance for the time to come and we  shall not have erred without reaping some instruction"  Then seating himself and making me sit by him he continued  "I must now guess again perhaps you regret the loss of those friends you knew in townperhaps you miss their society and fear you may see them no moreperhaps Lord Orville"  I could not keep my seat but rising hastily said  "Dear Sir ask me nothing morefor I have nothing to ownnothing to saymy gravity has been merely accidental and I can give no reason for it at all Shall I fetch you another bookor will you have this again"  For some minutes he was totally silent and I pretended to employ myself in looking for a book At last with a deep sigh  "I see"  said he  "I see but too plainly that though Evelina is returnedI have lost my child"  "No Sir no"  cried I inexpressibly shocked  "she is more yours than ever Without you the world would be a desart to her and life a burthenforgive her then andif you cancondescend to be once more the confident of all her thoughts"  "How highly I value how greatly I wish for her confidence"  returned he  "she cannot but knowyet to extort to tear it from hermy justice my affection both revolt at the idea I am sorry that I was so earnest with youleave me my dear leave me and compose yourselfwe will meet again at tea"  "Do you then refuse to hear me"  "No but I abhor to compel you I have long seen that your mind has been ill at ease and mine has largely partaken of your concern I forbore to question you for I hoped that time and absence from whatever excited your uneasiness  might best operate in silence but alas your affliction seems only to augmentyour health declinesyour look altersOh Evelina my aged heart bleeds to see the changebleeds to behold the darling it had cherished the prop it had reared for its support when bowed down by years and infirmities sinking itself under the pressure of internal griefstruggling to hide what it should seek to participateBut go my dear go to your own roomwe both want composure and we will talk of this matter some other time"  "Oh Sir"  cried I penetrated to the soul  "bid me not leave youthink me not so lost to feeling to gratitude"  "Not a word of that"  interrupted he  "it pains me you should think upon that subject pains me you should ever remember that you have not a natural an hereditary right to every thing within my power I meant not to affect you thusI hoped to have soothed youbut my anxiety betrayed me to an urgency that has distressed you Comfort yourself my love and doubt not but that time will stand your friend and all will end well"  I burst into tears with difficulty had I so long restrained them for my heart while it glowed with tenderness and gratitude was oppressed with a sense of its own unworthiness  "You are all all goodness"  cried I in a voice scarce audible  "little as I deserveunable as I am to repay such kindnessyet my whole soul feelsthanks you for it"  "My dearest child"  cried he  "I cannot bear to see thy tearsfor  my  sake dry themsuch a sight is too much for me think of that Evelina and take comfort I charge thee"  "Say then"  cried I kneeling at his feet  "say then that you forgive me that you pardon my reservethat you will again suffer me to tell you my most secret thoughts and rely upon my promise never more to forfeit your confidencemy fathermy protectormy ever honouredever lovedmy best and only friendsay you forgive your Evelina and she will study better to deserve your goodness"  He raised he embraced me he called me his sole joy his only earthly hope and the child of his bosom He folded me to his heart and while I wept from the fulness of mine with words of sweetest kindness and consolation he soothed and tranquilised me  Dear to my remembrance will ever be that moment when banishing the reserve I had so foolishly planned and so painfully supported I was restored to the confidence of the best of men  When at length we were again quietly and composedly seated by each other and Mr Villars waited for the explanation I had begged him to hear I found myself extremely embarrassed how to introduce the subject which must lead to it He saw my distress and with a kind of benevolent pleasantry asked me if I would let him  guess  any more I assented in silence  "Shall I then go back to where I left off"  "Ifif you pleaseI believe so"  said I stammering  "Well then my love I think I was speaking of the regret it was natural you should feel upon quitting those from whom you had received civility and kindness with so little certainty of ever seeing them again or being able to return  their good offices These are circumstances that afford but melancholy reflections to young minds and the affectionate disposition of my Evelina open to all social feelings must be hurt more than usual by such considerationsYou are silent my dearShall I name those whom I think most worthy the regret I speak of We shall then see if our opinions coincide"  Still I said nothing and he continued  "In your London journal nobody appears in a more amiable a more respectable light than Lord Orville and perhaps"  "I knew what you would say"  cried I hastily  "and I have long feared where your suspicions would fall but indeed Sir you are mistaken I hate Lord Orvillehe is the last man in the world in whose favour I should be prejudiced"  I stopped for Mr Villars looked at me with such infinite surprise that my own warmth made me blush  "You  hate  Lord Orville"  repeated he  I could make no answer but took from my pocketbook the letter and giving it to him  "See Sir"  said I  "how differently the same man can  talk  and  write  "  He read it three times ere he spoke and then said  "I am so much astonished that I know not what I read When had you this letter"  I told him Again he read it and after considering its contents some time said  "I can form but one conjecture concerning this most extraordinary performance he must certainly have been intoxicated when he wrote it"  "Lord Orville intoxicated"  repeated I  "once I thought him a stranger to all intemperance  but it is very possible for I can believe any thing now"  "That a man who had behaved with so strict a regard to delicacy"  continued Mr Villars  "and who as far as occasion had allowed manifested sentiments the most honourable should thus insolently thus wantonly insult a modest young woman in his perfect senses I cannot think possible But my dear you should have inclosed this letter in an empty cover and have returned it to him again such a resentment would at once have become  your  character and have given him an opportunity in some measure of clearing his own He could not well have read this letter the next morning without being sensible of the impropriety of having written it"  Oh Maria why had not I this thought I might then have received some apology the mortification would then have been  his  not  mine  It is true he could not have reinstated himself so highly in my opinion as I had once ignorantly placed him since the conviction of such intemperance would have levelled him with the rest of his imperfect race yet my humbled pride might have been consoled by his acknowledgments  But why should I allow myself to be humbled by a man who can suffer his reason to be thus abjectly debased when I am exalted by one who knows no vice and scarcely a failingbut by hearsay To think of his kindness and reflect upon his praises might animate and comfort me even in the midst of affliction  "Your indignation  "said he  is the result of virtue you fancied Lord Orville was without faulthe had the appearance of infinite worthiness and you supposed  his character accorded with his appearance guileless yourself how could you prepare against the duplicity of another Your disappointment has but been proportioned to your expectations and you have chiefly owed its severity to the innocence which hid its approach"  I will bid these words dwell ever in my memory and they shall chear comfort and enliven me This conversation though extremely affecting to me at the time it passed has relieved my mind from much anxiety Concealment my dear Maria is the foe of tranquility however I may err in future I will never be disingenuous in acknowledging my errors To you and to Mr Villars I vow an unremitting confidence  And yet though I am more at ease I am far from well I have been some time writing this letter but I hope I shall send you soon a more chearful one  Adieu my sweet friend I entreat you not to acquaint even your dear mother with this affair Lord Orville is a favourite with her and why should I publish that he deserves not that honour  LETTER XV  Evelina in continuation  Bristol Hotwell  August  YOU will be again surprised my dear Maria at seeing whence I date my letter but I have been very ill and Mr Villars was so much alarmed that he not only insisted upon my accompanying  Mrs Selwyn hither but earnestly desired she would hasten her intended journey  We travelled very slowly and I did not find myself so much fatigued as I expected We are situated upon a most delightful spot the prospect is beautiful the air pure and the weather very favourable to invalids I am already better and I doubt not but I shall soon be well as well in regard to mere health as I wish to be  I cannot express the reluctance with which I parted from my reverend Mr Villars it was not like that parting which last April preceded my journey to Howard Grove when all expectation and hope tho' I wept I rejoiced and though I sincerely grieved to leave him I yet wished to be gone the sorrow I now felt was unmixed with any livelier sensation expectation was vanished and hope I had none All that I held most dear upon earth I quitted and that upon an errand to the success of which I was totally indifferent the reestablishment of my health Had it been to have seen my sweet Maria or her dear mother I should not have repined  Mrs Selwyn is very kind and attentive to me She is extremely clever her understanding indeed may be called  masculine  but unfortunately her manners deserve the same epithet for in studying to acquire the knowledge of the other sex she has lost all the softness of her own In regard to myself however as I have neither courage nor inclination to argue with her I have never been personally hurt at her want of gentleness a virtue which nevertheless seems so essential a part of the female character that I find myself more awkward and less at ease with a woman who wants it than I do with a man She is not a favourite with Mr Villars who has often  been disgusted at her unmerciful propensity to satire but his anxiety that I should try the effect of the Bristol waters overcame his dislike of committing me to her care Mrs Clinton is also here so that I shall be as well attended as his utmost partiality could desire  I will continue to write to you my dear Miss Mirvan with as much constancy as if I had no other correspondent tho' during my absence from Berry Hill my letters may perhaps be shortened on account of the minuteness of the journal which I must write to my beloved Mr Villars but you who know his expectations and how many ties bind me to fulfil them will I am sure rather excuse any omission to yourself than any negligence to him  LETTER XVI  Evelina to the Rev Mr Villars  Bristol Hotwell  Sept  THE first fortnight that I passed here was so quiet so serene that it gave me reason to expect a settled calm during my stay but if I may now judge of the time to come by the present state of my mind the calm will be succeeded by a storm of which I dread the violence  This morning in my way to the pumproom with Mrs Selwyn we were both very much incommoded by three gentlemen who were sauntering by the side of the Avon laughing and talking very loud and lounging so disagreeably that we knew not how to pass them They all three fixed their eyes very boldly upon me alternately  looking under my hat and whispering one another Mrs Selwyn assumed an air of uncommon sternness and said  "You will please gentlemen either to proceed yourselves or to suffer us"  "Oh Ma'am"  cried one of them  "we will suffer  you  with the greatest pleasure in life"  "You will suffer us  both  "  answered she  "or I am much mistaken you had better therefore make way quietly for I should be sorry to give my servant the trouble of teaching you better manners"  Her commanding air struck them yet they all chose to laugh and one of them wished the fellow would begin his lesson that he might have the pleasure of rolling him into the Avon while another advancing to me with a freedom that made me start said  "By my soul I did not know youbut I am sure I cannot be mistakenhad not I the honour of seeing you once at the Pantheon"  I then recollected the nobleman who at that place had so much embarrassed me I courtsied without speaking They all bowed and making though in a very easy manner an apology to Mrs Selwyn they suffered us to pass on but chose to accompany us  "And where"  continued this Lord  "can you so long have hid yourself do you know I have been in search of you this age I could neither find you out nor hear of you not a creature could inform me what was become of you I cannot imagine where you could be immured I went to two or three public places every night in hopes of meeting you Pray did you leave town"  "Yes my Lord"  "So early in the seasonwhat could possibly induce you to go before the birthday"  "I had nothing my Lord to do with the birthday"  "By my soul all the women who  had  may rejoice you were away Have you been here any time"  "Not above a fortnight my Lord"  "A fortnighthow unlucky that I did not meet you sooner but I have had a run of ill luck ever since I came How long shall you stay"  "Indeed my Lord I don't know"  "Six weeks I hope for I shall wish the place at the devil when you go"  "Do you then flatter yourself my Lord"  said Mrs Selwin who had hitherto listened in silent contempt  "that you shall see such a beautiful spot as this when you visit the dominions of the devil"  "Ha ha ha Faith my Lord  "said one of his companions who still walked with us though the other had taken leave  "the lady is rather hard upon you"  "Not at all"  answered Mrs Selwyn  "for as I cannot doubt but his Lordship's rank and interest will secure him a place there it would be reflecting on his understanding to suppose he should not wish to enlarge and beautify his dwelling"  Much as I was disgusted with this Lord I must own Mrs Selwyn's severity rather surprised me but you who have so often observed it will not wonder she took so fair an opportun  ty of indulging her humour  "As to  places  "  returned he totally unmoved  "I am so indifferent to them that the devil take me if I care which way I go  objects  indeed I am not so easy about and therefore I expect  that those angels with whose beauty I am so much enraptured in this world will have the goodness to afford me some little consolation in the other"  "What my Lord"  cried Mrs Selwyn  "would you wish to degrade the habitation of your friend by admitting into it the insipid company of the upper regions"  "What do you do with yourself this evening"  said his Lordship turning to me  "I shall be at home my Lord"  "O aproposwhere are you"  "Young ladies my Lord"  said Mrs Selwyn  "are  no where  "  "Prithee"  whispered his Lordship  "is that queer woman your mother"  Good Heavens Sir what words for such a question  "No my Lord"  "Your maiden aunt then"  "No"  "Whoever she is I wish she would mind her own affairs I don't know what the devil a woman lives for after thirty she is only in other folks way Shall you be at the assembly"  "I believe not my Lord"  "Nowhy then how in the world can you contrive to pass your time"  "In a manner that your Lordship will think very extraordinary"  cried Mrs Selwyn  "for the young lady  reads  "  "Ha ha ha Egad my Lord"  cried the facetious companion  "you are got into bad hands"  "You had better Madam"  answered he  "attack Jack Coverley here for you will make nothing of me"  "Of  you  my Lord"  cried she  "Heaven forbid I should ever entertain so idle an expectation I only talk like a silly woman for the sake of talking but I have by no means so low an opinion of your Lordship as to suppose you vulnerable to censure"  "Do pray Ma'am"  cried he  "turn to Jack Coverley he's the very man for youhe'd be a wit himself if he was n't too modest"  "Prithee my Lord be quiet"  returned the other  if the Lady is contented to bestow all her favours upon  you  why should you make such a point of my going snacks"  "Don't be apprehensive Gentlemen"  said Mrs Selwyn drily  "I am not romanticI have not the least design of doing good to either of you"  "Have not you been ill since I saw you"  said his Lordship again addressing himself to me  "Yes my Lord"  "I thought so you are paler than you was and I suppose that's the reason I did not recollect you sooner"  "Has not your Lordship too much gallantry"  cried Mrs Selwyn  to discover a young lady's illness by her looks"  "The devil a word can I speak for that woman"  said he in a low voice  "do prithee Jack take her in hand"  "Excuse me my Lord"  answered Mr Coverley  "When shall I see you again"  continued his Lordship  "do you go to the pumproom every morning"  "No my Lord"  "Do you ride out"  "No my Lord"  Just then we arrived at the pumproom and an end was put to our conversation if it is not an abuse of words to give such a term to a string of rude questions and free compliments  He had not opportunity to say much more to me as Mrs Selwyn joined a large party and I walked home between two ladies He had however the curiosity to see us to the door  Mrs Selwyn was very eager to know how I had made acquaintance with this nobleman whose manners so evidently announced the character of a confirmed libertine I could give her very little satisfaction as I was ignorant even of his name But in the afternoon Mr Ridgeway the apothecary gave us very ample information  As his person was easily described for he is remarkably tall Mr Ridgeway told us he was Lord Merton a nobleman but lately come to his title though he had already dissipated more than half his fortune a professed admirer of beauty but a man of most licentious character that among men his companions consisted chiefly of gamblers and jockies and among women he was rarely admitted  "Well Miss Anville"  said Mrs Selwyn  "I am glad I was not more civil to him You may depend upon  me  for keeping him at a distance"  "O Madam"  said Mr Ridgeway  "he may now be admitted any where for he is going to  reform  "  "Has he under that notion persuaded any fool to marry him"  "Not yet Madam but a marriage is expected to take place shortly it has been some time in agitation but the friends of the Lady have obliged her to wait till she is of age however her brother who has chiefly opposed the match now that she is near being at her own disposal is tolerably quiet She is very pretty and will have a large fortune We expect her at the Wells every day"  "What is her name"  said Mrs Selwyn  "Larpent"  answered he  "Lady Louisa Larpent sister of Lord Orville"  "Lord Orville"  repeated I all amazement  Yes Ma'am his Lordship is coming with her I have had certain information They are to be at the honourable Mrs Beaumont's She is a relation of my Lord's and has a very fine house upon Clifton Hill"  His Lordship is coming with her  Good God what an emotion did those words give me How strange my dear Sir that just at this time he should visit Bristol It will be impossible for me to avoid seeing him as Mrs Selwyn is very well acquainted with Mrs Beaumont Indeed I have had an escape in not being under the same roof with him for Mrs Beaumont invited us to her house immediately upon our arrival but the inconveniency of being so distant from the pumproom made Mrs Selwyn decline her civility  Oh that the first meeting was overor that I could quit Bristol without seeing himinexpressibly do I dread an interview should the same impertinent freedom be expressed by his looks which dictated his cruel letter I shall not know how to endure either him or myself Had I but returned it I should be easier because my sentiments of it would then be known to him but  now he can only gather them from my behaviour and I tremble lest he should mistake my indignation for confusionlest he should misconstrue my reserve into embarrassmentfor how my dearest Sir how shall I be able totally to divest myself of the respect with which I have been used to think of himthe pleasure with which I have been used to see him  Surely he as well as I must think of the letter at the moment of our meeting and he will probably mean to gather my thoughts of it from my looksoh that they could but convey to him my real detestation of impertinence and vanity then would he see how much he had mistaken my disposition when he imagined them my due  There was a time when the very idea that such a man as Lord Merton would ever be connected with Lord Orville would have both surprised and shocked me and even yet I am pleased to hear of his repugnance to the marriage  But how strange that a man of so abandoned a character should be the choice of a sister of Lord Orville and how strange that almost at the moment of the union he should be so importunate in gallantry to another woman What a world is this we live in how corrupt how degenerate well might I be contented to see no more of it If I find that the  eyes  of Lord Orville agree with his  pen  I shall then think that of all mankind the only virtuous individual resides at Berry Hill  LETTER XVII  Evelina in continuation  Bristol Hotwells  Sept  OH Sir Lord Orville is still himself still what from the moment I beheld I believed him to be all that was amiable in man and your happy Evelina restored at once to spirits and tranquility is no longer sunk in her own opinion nor discontented with the worldno longer with dejected eyes sees the prospect of passing her future days in sadness doubt and suspicionwith revived courage she now looks forward and expects to meet with goodness even among mankindthough still she feels as strongly as ever the folly of hoping in any  second  instance to meet with  perfection  Your conjecture was certainly right Lord Orville when he wrote that letter could not be in his senses Oh that intemperance should have power to degrade so low a man so noble  This morning I accompanied Mrs Selwyn to Clifton Hill where beautifully situated is the house of Mrs Beaumont Most uncomfortable were my feelings during our walk which was very slow for the agitation of my mind made me more than usually sensible how weak I still continue As we entered the house I summoned all my resolution to my aid determined rather to die than give Lord Orville reason to attribute my weakness to a wrong cause I was happily relieved from my perturbation when I saw Mrs Beaumont was alone We sat with her for I believe  an hour without interruption and then we saw a phaeton drive up to the gate and a lady and gentleman alight from it  They entered the parlour with the ease of people who were at home The gentleman I soon saw was Lord Merton he came shuffling into the room with his boots on and his whip in his hand and having made something like a bow to Mrs Beaumont he turned towards me His surprise was very evident but he took no manner of notice of me He waited I believe to discover first what chance had brought me to that house where he did not look much rejoiced at meeting me He seated himself very quietly at the window without speaking to any body  Mean time the lady who seemed very young hobbling rather than walking into the room made a passing courtsie to Mrs Beaumont saying  "How are you Ma'am"  and then without noticing any body else with an air of languor she flung herself upon a sofa protesting in a most affected voice and speaking so softly she could hardly be heard that she was fatigued to death  "Really Ma'am the roads are so monstrous dustyyou can't imagine how troublesome the dust is to one's eyesand the sun too is monstrous disagreeableI dare say I shall be so tanned I sha'n't be fit to be seen this age Indeed my Lord I won't go out with you any more for you don't care where you take one"  "Upon my honour"  said Lord Merton  "I took you the pleasantest ride in England the fault was in the sun not me"  "Your Lordship is in the right"  said Mrs Selwyn  "to transfer the fault to the  sun  because it has so many excellencies to counterbalance partial  inconveniencies that a  little  blame will not injure  that  in our estimation"  Lord Merton looked by no means delighted at this attack which I believe she would not so readily have made but to revenge his neglect of us  "Did you meet your brother Lady Louisa"  said Mrs Beaumont  "No Ma'am Is he rode out this morning"  I then found what I had before suspected that this Lady was Lord Orville's sister how strange that such near relations should be so different to each other There is indeed some resemblance in their features but in their manners not the least  "Yes"  answered Mrs Beaumont  "and I believe he wished to see you"  "My Lord drove so monstrous fast"  said Lady Louisa  "that perhaps we passed him He frighted me out of my senses I declare my head is quite giddy Do you know Ma'am we have done nothing but quarrel all the morningYou can't think how I've scoldedhave not I my Lord"  and she smiled expressively at Lord Merton  "You have been as you always are"  said he twisting his whip with his fingers  "all sweetness"  "O fie my Lord"  cried she  "I know you don't think so I know you think me very illnatureddon't you my Lord"  "No upon my honourhow can your Ladyship ask such a question Pray how goes time my watch stands"  "It is almost three"  answered Mrs Beaumont  "Lord Ma'am you frighten me"  cried Lady Louisa and then turning to Lord Merton  "why now you wicked creature you did not you tell me it was but one"  Mrs Selwyn then rose to take leave but Mrs Beaumont asked if she would look at the shrubbery  "I should like it much"  answered she  "but that I fear to fatigue Miss Anville"  Lady Louisa then raising her head from her hand on which it had leant turned round to look at me and having fully satisfied her curiosity without any regard to the confusion it gave me turned about and again leaning on her hand took no further notice of me  I declared myself very able to walk and begged that I might accompany them  "What say  you  Lady Louisa"  cried Mrs Beaumont  "to a strole in the garden"  "Me Ma'amI declare I can't stir a step the heat is so excessive it would kill me I'm half dead with it already besides I shall have no time to dress Will any body be here to day Ma'am"  "I believe not unless Lord Merton will favour us with his company"  "With great pleasure Madam"  "Well I declare you don't deserve to be asked"  cried Lady Louisa  "you wicked creature youI  must  tell you one thing Ma'amyou can't think how abominable he was do you know we met Mr Lovel in his new phaeton and my Lord was so cruel as to drive against itwe really flew I declare I could not breathe Upon my word my Lord I'll never trust myself with you againI won't indeed"  We then went into the garden leaving them to discuss the point at their leisure  Do you remember a  pretty but affected young lady  I mentioned to have seen in Lord Orville's party at the Pantheon How little did I then imagine her to be his sister yet Lady Louisa Larpent is the very person I can now account for the piqued manner of her speaking to Lord Merton that evening and I can now account for the air of displeasure with which Lord Orville marked the undue attention of his future brotherinlaw to me  We had not walked long ere at a distance I perceived Lord Orville who seemed just dismounted from his horse enter the garden All my perturbation returned at the sight of himyet I endeavoured to repress every feeling but resentment As he approached us he bowed to the whole party but I turned away my head to avoid taking any share in his civility Addressing himself immediately to Mrs Beaumont he was beginning to enquire after his sister but upon seeing my face he suddenly exclaimed  "Miss Anville"  and then he advanced and made his compliments to menot with an air of vanity or impertinence nor yet with a look of consciousness or shamebut with a countenance open manly and charmingwith a smile that indicated pleasure and eyes that sparkled with delight on  my  side was all the consciousness for by him I really believe the letter was at that moment entirely forgotten  With what politeness did he address me with what sweetness did he look at me the very tone of his voice seemed flattering he congratulated himself upon his good fortune in meeting with mehoped I should spend some time at Bristol and enquired even with anxiety enquired  if my health was the cause of my journey in which case his satisfaction would be converted into apprehension  Yet struck as I was with his manner and charmed to find him such as he was wont to be imagine not my dear Sir that I forgot the resentment I owe him or the cause he has given me of displeasure no my behaviour was such as I hope had you seen you would not have disapproved I was grave and distant I scarce looked at him when he spoke or answered him when he was silent  As he must certainly observe this alteration in my conduct I think it could not fail making him both recollect and repent the provocation he had so causelessly given me for surely he was not so wholly lost to reason as to be now ignorant he had ever offended me  The moment that without absolute rudeness I was able I turned entirely from him and asked Mrs Selwyn if we should not be late home How Lord Orville looked I know not for I avoided meeting his eyes but he did not speak another word as we proceeded to the gardengate Indeed I believe my abruptness surprised him for he did not seem to expect I had so much spirit And to own the truth convinced as I was of the propriety nay necessity of shewing my displeasure I yet almost hated myself for receiving his politeness so ungraciously  When we were taking leave my eyes accidentally meeting his I could not but observe that his gravity equalled my own for it had entirely taken place of the smiles and goodhumour with which he had met me  "I am afraid this young Lady"  said Mrs Beaumont  "is too weak for another long walk till she is again rested"  "If the Ladies will trust to my driving"  said Lord Orville  "and are not afraid of a phaeton mine shall be ready in a moment"  "You are very good my Lord"  said Mrs Selwyn  "but my will is yet unsigned and I don't chuse to venture in a phaeton with a young man while that is the case"  "O"  cried Mrs Beaumont  "you need not be afraid of my Lord Orville for he is remarkably careful"  "Well Miss Anville"  answered she  "what say you"  "Indeed"  cried I  "I had much rather walk"  But then looking at Lord Orville I perceived in his face a surprise so serious at my abrupt refusal that I could not forbear adding  "for I should be sorry to occasion so much trouble"  Lord Orville brightening at these words came forward and pressed his offer in a manner not to be deniedso the phaeton was ordered And indeed my dear SirI know not how it wasbut from that moment my coldness and reserve insensibly wore away You must not be angryit was my intention nay my endeavour to support them with firmness but when I formed the plan I thought only of the letternot of Lord Orvilleand how is it possible for resentment to subsist without provocation yet believe me my dearest Sir had he sustained the part he began to act when he wrote the evertobe regretted letter your Evelina would not have forfeited her title to your esteem by contentedly submitting to be treated with indignity  We continued in the garden till the phaeton was ready When we parted from Mrs Beaumont she repeated her invitation to Mrs Selwyn to accept an apartment in her house but the same reasons made it be again declined  Lord Orville drove very slow and so cautiously that notwithstanding the height of the phaeton fear would have been ridiculous I supported no part in the conversation but Mrs Selwyn extremely well supplied the place of two Lord Orville himself did not speak much but the excellent sense and refined goodbreeding which accompany every word he utters give a  zest  to whatever he says  "I suppose my Lord"  said Mrs Selwyn  "when we stopped at our lodgings you would have been extremely confused had we met any gentlemen who have the honour of knowing you"  "If I had"  answered he gallantly  "it would have been from mere compassion at their envy"  "No my Lord"  answered she  "it would have been from mere shame that in an age so daring you alone should be such a coward as to forbear to frighten women"  "O"  cried he laughing  "when a man is in a fright for himself the ladies cannot but be in security for you have not had half the apprehension for the safety of your persons that I have for that of my heart"  He then alighted handed us out took leave and again mounting the phaeton was out of sight in a minute  "Certainly"  said Mrs Selwyn when he was gone  "there must have been some mistake in the birth of that young man he was undoubtedly  designed for the last age for if you observed he is really polite"  And now my dear Sir do not you think according to the present situation of affairs I may give up my resentment without imprudence or impropriety I hope you will not blame me Indeed had you like me seen his respectful behaviour you would have been convinced of the impracticability of supporting any further indignation  LETTER XVIII  Evelina in continuation  Bristol Hotwells  Sept th  YESTERDAY morning Mrs Selwyn received a card from Mrs Beaumont to ask her to dinner today and another to the same purpose came to me The invitation was accepted and we are but just arrived from CliftonHill  We found Mrs Beaumont alone in the parlour I will write you that lady's character as I heard it from our satirical friend Mrs Selwyn and in her own words  "She is an absolute  Court Calendar bigot  for chancing herself to be born of a noble and ancient family she thinks proper to be of opinion that  birth  and  virtue  are one and the same thing She has some good qualities but they rather originate from pride than principle as she piques herself upon being too high born to be capable of an unworthy action and thinks it incumbent upon her to support the dignity of her ancestry Fortunately for the world in general  she has taken it into her head that condescension is the most distinguishing virtue of high life so that the same pride of family which renders others imperious is with her the motive of affability But her civility is too formal to be comfortable and too mechanical to be flattering That she does  me  the honour of so much notice is merely owing to an accident which I am sure is very painful to her remembrance for it so happened that I once did her some service in regard to an apartment at Southampton and I have since been informed that at the time she accepted my assistance she thought I was a woman of quality and I make no doubt but she was miserable when she discovered me to be a mere country gentlewoman however her nice notions of decorum have made her load me with favours ever since But I am not much flattered by her civilities as I am convinced I owe them neither to attachment nor gratitude but solely to a desire of cancelling an obligation which she cannot brook being under to one whose name is no where to be found in the Court Calendar"  You well know my dear Sir the delight this lady takes in giving way to her satirical humour  Mrs Beaumont received us very graciously though she somewhat distressed me by the questions she asked concerning my familysuch as whether I was related to the Anvilles in the NorthWhether some of my name did not live in Lincolnshire and many other enquiries which much embarrassed me  The conversation next turned upon the intended marriage in her family She treated the subject with reserve but it was evident she disapproved Lady Louisa's choice She spoke in terms of the highest esteem of Lord Orville calling  him in Marmontel's words  Un jeune homme comme il y en a peu  I did not think this conversation very agreeably interrupted by the entrance of Mr Lovel Indeed I am heartily sorry he is now at the Hotwells He made his compliments with the most obsequious respect to Mrs Beaumont but took no sort of notice of any other person  In a few minutes Lady Louisa Larpent made her appearance The same manners prevailed for courtsying  "I hope you are well Ma'am"  to Mrs Beaumont she passed straight forward to her seat on the sofa where leaning her head on her hand she cast her languishing eyes round the room with a vacant stare as if determined though she looked not to see who was in it  Mr Lovel presently approaching her with reverence the most profound hoped her Ladyship was not indisposed  "Mr Lovel"  cried she raising her head  "I declare I did not see you Have you been here long"  "By my  watch  Madam"  said he  "only five minutesbut by your ladyship's absence as many hours"  "O now I think of it"  cried she  "I am very angry with youso go along do for I shan't speak to you all day"  "Heaven forbid your La'ship's displeasure should last so long in such cruel circumstances a day would seem an age But in what have I been so unfortunate as to offend"  "O you halfkilled me the other morning with terror I have not yet recovered from my fright How could you be so cruel as to drive your phaeton against my Lord Merton's"  "'Pon honour Ma'am your La'ship does me wrong it was all owing to the horsesthere was no curbing them I protest I suffered more than your Ladyship from the terror of alarming you"  Just then entered Lord Merton stalking up to Mrs Beaumont to whom alone he bowed he hoped he had not made her wait and then advancing to Lady Louisa said in a careless manner  "How is your Ladyship this morning"  "Not well at all"  answered she  "I have been dying with the headach ever since I got up"  "Indeed"  cried he with a countenance wholly unmoved  "I am very unhappy to hear it But should not your Ladyship have some advice"  "I am quite sick of advice"  answered she  "Mr Ridgeway has but just left mebut he has done me no good Nobody here knows what is the matter with me yet they all see how indifferent I am"  "Your Ladyship's constitution"  said Mr Lovel  "is infinitely delicate"  "Indeed it is"  cried she in a low voice  I am  nerve  all over"  "I am glad however"  said Lord Merton  "that you did not take the air this morning for Coverly has been driving against me as if he was mad he has got two of the finest spirited horses I ever saw"  "Pray My Lord"  cried she  "why did not you bring Mr Coverly with you he's a droll creature I like him monstrously"  "Why he promised to be here as soon as me I suppose he'll come before dinner's over"  In the midst of this trifling conversation Lord Orville made his appearance O how different was his address how superior did he look and move to all about him Having paid his respects to Mrs Beaumont and then to Mrs Selwyn he came up to me and said  "I hope Miss Anville has not suffered from the fatigue of Monday morning"  Then turning to Lady Louisa who seemed rather surprised at his speaking to me he added  "give me leave sister to introduce Miss Anville to you"  Lady Louisa halfrising said very coldly that she should be glad of the honour of knowing me and then very abruptly turning to Lord Merton and Mr Lovel continued in a halfwhisper her conversation  For my part I had risen and courtsied and now feeling very foolish I seated myself again first I had blushed at the unexpected politeness of Lord Orville and immediately afterwards at the contemptuous failure of it in his sister How can that young Lady see her brother so universally admired for his manners and deportment and yet be so unamiably opposite to him in her's  Lord Orville I am sure was hurt and displeased he bit his lips and turning from her addressed himself wholly to me till we were summoned to dinner Do you think I was not grateful for his attention yes indeed and every angry idea I had entertained was totally obliterated  As we were seating ourselves at the table Mr Coverly came into the room he made a thousand apologies in a breath for being so late but said he had been retarded by a little accident for that he had overturned his phaeton and broke  it all to pieces Lady Louisa screamed at this intelligence and looking at Lord Merton declared she would never go into a phaeton again  "O"  cried he  "never mind Jack Coverly for he does not know how to drive"  "My Lord"  cried Mr Coverly  "I'll drive against  you  for a thousand pounds"  "Done"  returned the other  "Name your day and we'll each chuse a judge"  "The sooner the better"  cried Mr Coverly  "tomorrow if the carriage can be repaired"  "These enterprises"  said Mrs Selwyn  "are very proper for men of rank since 'tis a million to one but both parties will be incapacitated for any better employment"  "For Heaven's sake"  cried Lady Louisa changing colour  "don't talk so shockingly Pray my Lord pray Mr Coverly don't alarm me in this manner"  "Compose yourself Lady Louisa"  said Mrs Beaumont  "the gentlemen will think better of the scheme they are neither of them in earnest"  "The very mention of such a scheme"  said Lady Louisa taking out her salts  "makes me tremble all over Indeed my Lord you have frightened me to death I shan't eat a morsel of dinner"  "Permit me"  said Lord Orville  "to propose some other subject for the present and we will discuss this matter some other time"  "Pray Brother excuse me my Lord must give me his word to drop this projectfor I declare it has made me sick as death"  "To compromise the matter"  said Lord Orville  "suppose if both parties are unwilling to give up the bet that to make the ladies  easy we change its object to something less dangerous"  This proposal was so strongly seconded by all the party that both Lord Merton and Mr Coverly were obliged to comply with it and it was then agreed that the affair should be finally settled in the afternoon  "I shall now be entirely out of conceit with phaetons again"  said Mrs Selwyn  "though Lord Orville had almost reconciled me to them"  "My Lord Orville  "cried the witty Mr Coverly  "why my Lord Orville is as carefulegad as careful as an old woman Why I'd drive a onehorse cart against my Lord's phaeton for a hundred guineas"  This sally occasioned much laughter for Mr Coverly I find is regarded as a man of infinite humour  "Perhaps Sir"  said Mrs Selwyn  "you have not discovered the  reason  my Lord Orville is so careful"  "Why no Ma'am I must own I never heard any particular reason for it"  "Why then Sir I'll tell you and I believe you will confess it to be  very  particular his Lordship's friends are not yet tired of him"  Lord Orville laughed and bowed Mr Coverly a little confused turned to Lord Merton and said  "No foul play my Lord I remember your Lordship recommended me to the notice of this Lady the other morning and egad I believe you have been doing me the same office today"  "Give you joy Jack"  cried Lord Merton with a loud laugh  After this the conversation turned wholly upon eating a subject which was discussed with the utmost delight and had I not known they were men of rank and fashion I should have imagined that Lord Merton Mr Lovel and Mr Coverly had all been professed cooks for they displayed so much knowledge of sauces and made dishes and of the various methods of dressing the same things that I am persuaded they must have given much time and much study to make themselves such adepts in this  art  It would be very difficult to determine whether they were most to be distinguished as  gluttons  or  epicures  for they were at once dainty and voracious understood the right and the wrong of every dish and alike emptied the one and the other I should have been quite sick of their remarks had I not been entertained by seeing that Lord Orville who I am sure was equally disgusted not only read my sentiments but by his countenance communicated to me his own  When dinner was over Mrs Beaumont recommended the gentlemen to the care of Lord Orville and then attended the ladies to the drawingroom  The conversation till teatime was extremely insipid Mrs Selwyn reserved herself for the gentlemen Mrs Beaumont was grave and Lady Louisa languid  But at tea every body revived we were joined by the gentlemen and gaiety took place of dulness  Since I as Mr Lovel says am  Nobody  Vol I p  I seated myself quietly on a window and not very  near to any body Lord Merton Mr Coverly and Mr Lovel severally passed me without notice and surrounded the chair of Lady Louisa Larpent I must own I was rather piqued at the behaviour of Mr Lovel as he had formerly known me It is true I most sincerely despised his foppery yet I should be grieved to meet with  contempt  from any body But I was by no means sorry to find that Lord Merton was determined not to know me before Lady Louisa as his neglect relieved me from much embarrassment As to Mr Coverly his attention or disregard were equally indifferent to me Yet altogether I felt extremely uncomfortable in finding myself considered in a light very inferior to the rest of the company  But when Lord Orville appeared the scene changed he came up stairs last and seeing me sit alone not only spoke to me directly but drew a chair next mine and honoured me with his entire attention  He enquired very particularly after my health and hoped I had already found benefit from the Bristol air  "How little did I imagine"  added he  "when I had last the pleasure of seeing you in town that ill health would in so short a time have brought you hither I am ashamed of myself for the satisfaction I feel at seeing youyet how can I help it"  He then enquired after the Mirvan family and spoke of Mrs Mirvan in terms of the most just praise  "She is gentle and amiable"  said he  "a true feminine character"  "Yes indeed"  answered I  "and her sweet daughter to say every thing of her at once is just the daughter such a mother deserves"  "I am glad of it"  said he  "for both their sakes as such near relations must always reflect credit or disgrace on each other"  After this he began to speak of the beauties of Clifton but in a few moments was interrupted by a call from the company to discuss the affair of the wager Lord Merton and Mr Coverley though they had been discoursing upon the subject some time could not fix upon any thing that satisfied them both  When they asked the assistance of Lord Orville he proposed that every body present should vote something and that the two gentlemen should draw lots which from the several votes should decide the bet  "We must then begin with the ladies"  said Lord Orville and applied to Mrs Selwyn  "With all my heart"  answered she with her usual readiness  "and since the gentlemen are not allowed to risk their  necks  suppose we decide the bet by their  heads  "  "By our heads"  cried Mr Coverly Egad  "I dont understand you"  "I will then explain myself more fully As I doubt not but you are both excellent classics suppose for the good of your own memories and the entertainment and surprise of the company the thousand pounds should fall to the share of him who can repeat by heart the longest ode of Horace"  Nobody could help laughing the two gentlemen applied to excepted who seemed each of them rather at a loss in what manner to receive this unexpected proposal At length Mr Lovel bowing low said  "Will your Lordship please to begin  "Devil take me if I do"  answered he turning on his heel and stalking to the window  "Come Gentlemen"  said Mrs Selwyn  "why do you hesitate I am sure you cannot be afraid of a weak  woman  Besides if you should chance to be out Mr Lovel I dare say will have the goodness to assist you"  The laugh now turned against Mr Lovel whose change of countenance manifested no great pleasure at the transition  "Me Madam"  said he colouring  "no "really I must beg to be excused"  "Why so Sir"  "Why so Ma'amWhy reallyas to that'pon honour Ma'am you are rathera little severefor how is it possible for a man who is in the House to study the classics I assure you Ma'am"  with an affected shrug  "I find quite business enough for  my  poor head in studying politics"  "But did you study politics at school and at the university"  "At the university"  repeated he with an embarrassed look  "why as to that Ma'amno I can't say I did but then what with ridingandandand so forthreally one has not much time even at the university for mere reading"  "But to be sure Sir you  have  read the classics"  "O dear yes Ma'amvery oftenbut not verynot very lately"  "Which of the odes do you recommend to these gentlemen to begin with"  "Which of the odesReally Ma'am as to that I have no very particular choicefor  to own the truth that Horace was never a very great favourite with me"  "In truth I believe you"  said Mrs Selwyn very drily  Lord Merton again advancing into the circle with a nod and a laugh said  "Give you joy Lovel"  Lord Orville next applied to Mrs Beaumont for her vote  "It would very agreeably remind me of past times"  said she  when  bowing  was in fashion if the bet was to depend upon the bestmade bow"  "Egad my Lord"  cried Mr Coverley  "there I should beat you hollow for your Lordship never bows at all  "And pray Sir do  you  said Mrs Selwyn  Do  I  Ma'am"  cried he  "Why only see"  "I protest"  cried she  "I should have taken  that  for a  shrug  if you had not told me 'twas a bow"  "My Lord"  cried Mr Coverly  "let's practise"  and then most ridiculously they pranced about the room making bows  "We must now"  said Lord Orville turning to me  "call upon Miss Anville"  "O no my Lord"  cried I  "indeed I have nothing to propose"  He would not however be refused but urged me so much to say  something  that at last not to make him wait any longer I ventured to propose an extempore couplet upon some given subject  Mr Coverley instantly made me a bow or according to Mrs Selwyn a  shrug  crying  "Thank you Ma'am egad that's my  fort  Why my Lord the Fates seem against you"  Lady Louisa was then applied to and every body seemed eager to hear her opinion  "I don't know what to say I declare"  cried she affectedly  "can't you pass me"  "By no means"  said Lord Merton  "Is it possible your Ladyship can make so cruel a request"  said Mr Lovel  "Egad"  cried Mr Coverley  "if your Ladyship does not help us in this dilemma we shall be forced to return to our phaetons"  "Oh"  cried Lady Louisa screaming  "you frightful creature you how can you be so abominable"  I believe this trifling lasted near half an hour when at length every body being tired it was given up and she said she would consider against another time  Lord Orville now called upon Mr Lovel who after about ten minutes deliberation proposed with a most important face to determine the wager by who should draw the longest straw  I had much difficulty to refrain laughing at this unmeaning scheme but saw to my great surprise not the least change of countenance in any other person and since we came home Mrs Selwyn has informed me that to  draw straws  is a fashion of betting by no means uncommon Good God my dear Sir does it not seem as if money were of no value or service since those who possess squander it away in a manner so infinitely absurd  It now only remained for Lord Orville to speak and the attention of the company shewed the expectations he had raised yet I believe they by no means prevented his proposal from being heard with amazement for it was no other than that  the money should be his due who according to the opinion of two judges should bring the worthiest object with whom to share it  They all stared without speaking Indeed I believe every one for a moment at least experienced something like shame from having either proposed or countenanced an extravagance so useless and frivolous For my part I was so much struck and affected by a rebuke so noble to these spendthrifts that I felt my eyes filled with tears  The short silence and momentary reflection into which the company was surprised Mr Coverly was the first to dispel by saying  "Egad my Lord your Lordship has a most remarkable odd way of taking things"  "Faith"  said the incorrigible Lord Merton  "if this scheme takes I shall fix upon my Swiss to share with me for I dont know a worthier fellow breathing"  After a few more of these attempts at wit the two gentlemen agreed that they would settle the affair the next morning  The conversation then took a different turn but I did not give it sufficient attention to write any account of it Not long after Lord Orville resuming his seat next mine said  "Why is Miss Anville so thoughtful"  "I am sorry my Lord"  said I  "to consider myself one among those who have so justly incurred your censure"  "My censureyou amaze me"  "Indeed my Lord you have made me quite ashamed of myself for having given my vote so foolishly when an opportunity offered had I but like your Lordship had the sense to use it of shewing some humanity"  "You treat this too seriously"  said he smiling  "and I hardly know if you do not now mean a rebuke to  me  "  "To you my Lord"  "Nay which deserves it most the one who adapts the conversation to the company or the one who chooses to be above it"  "O my Lord who else would do you so little justice"  "I flatter myself"  answered he  "that in fact your opinion and mine in this point were the same though you condescended to comply with the humour of the company It is for me therefore to apologize for so unseasonable a gravity which but for a particular interest which I now take in the affairs of Lord Merton I should not have been so officious to display"  Such a compliment as this could not fail to reconcile me to myself and with revived spirits I entered into a conversation which he supported with me till Mrs Selwyn's carriage was announced and we returned home  During our ride Mrs Selwyn very much surprised me by asking if I thought my health would now permit me to give up my morning walks to the pumproom for the purpose of spending a week at Clifton  "for this poor Mrs Beaumont"  added she  "is so eager to have a discharge in full of her debt to me that out of mere compassion I am induced to listen to her Besides she has always a house full of people and though they are chiefly fools and coxcombs yet there is some pleasure in cutting them up"  I begged I might not by any means prevent her following her inclination as my health was now very well established And so my dear Sir tomorrow  we are to be actually the guests of Mrs Beaumont  I am not much delighted at this scheme for flattered as I am by the attention of Lord Orville it is not very comfortable to be neglected by every body else Besides as I am sure I owe the particularity of his civility to a generous feeling for my situation I cannot expect him to support it so long as a week  How often do I wish since I am absent from you that I was under the protection of Mrs Mirvan It is true Mrs Selwyn is very obliging and in every respect treats me as an equal but she is contented with behaving well herself and does not with a distinguishing politeness raise and support me with others Yet I mean not to blame her for I know she is sincerely my friend but the fact is she is herself so much occupied in conversation when in company that she has neither leisure nor thought to attend to the silent  Well I must take my chance But I knew not till now how requisite are birth and fortune to the attainment of respect and civility  LETTER XIX  Evelina in continuation  Clifton  Sept th  HERE I am my dear Sir under the same roof and inmate of the same house as Lord Orville Indeed if this were not the case my situation  would be very disagreeable as you will easily believe when I tell you the light in which I am generally considered  "My dear"  said Mrs Selwyn  "did you ever before meet with that egregious fop Lovel"  I very readily satisfied her as to my acquaintance with him  "O then"  said she  "I am the less surprised at his illnature since he has already injured you"  I begged her to explain herself and then she told me that while Lord Orville was speaking to me Lady Louisa said to Mr Lovel  "Do you know who that is"  "Why Ma'am no 'pon honour"  answered he  "I can't absolutely say I do I only know she is a kind of a toadeater She made her first appearance in that capacity last Spring when she attended Miss Mirvan a young lady of Kent"  How cruel is it my dear Sir to be thus exposed to the impertinent suggestions of a man who is determined to do me ill offices Lady Louisa may well despise a  toodeater  but thank Heaven her brother had not heard or does not credit the mortifying appellation Mrs Selwyn said she would advise me to  pay my court  to this Mr Lovel  "for"  said she  "though he is malicious he is fashionable and may do you some harm in the great world"  But I should disdain myself as much as I do him were I capable of such duplicity as to flatter a man whom I scorn and despise  We were received by Mrs Beaumont with great civility and by Lord Orville with something more As to Lady Louisa she scarcely perceived that we were in the room  There has been company here all day part of which I have spent most happily for after tea when the ladies played at cards Lord Orville who does not and I who cannot play were consequently at our own disposal and then his Lordship entered into a conversation with me which lasted till suppertime  Almost insensibly I find the constraint the reserve I have been wont to feel in his presence wear away the politeness the sweetness with which he speaks to me restore all my natural chearfulness and make me almost as easy as he is himself and the more so as if I may judge by his looks I am rather raised than sunk of late in his opinion  I asked him how the bet was at last to be decided He told me that to his great satisfaction the parties had been prevailed upon to lower the sum from one thousand to one hundred pounds and that they had determined it should be settled by a race between two old women one chose by each side and both of them to be proved more than eighty though in other respects strong and healthy as possible  When I expressed my surprise at this extraordinary method of spending so much money  "I am charmed"  said he  "at the novelty of meeting with one so unhackneyed in the world as not to be yet influenced by custom to forget the use of reason for certain it is that the prevalence of fashion makes the greatest absurdities pass uncensured and the mind naturally accommodates itself even to the most ridiculous improprieties if they occur frequently"  "I should have hoped"  said I  "that the humane proposal made yesterday by your Lordship would have had more effect"  "O"  cried he laughing  "I was so far from expecting any success that I shall think myself very fortunate if I escape the wit of Mr Coverley in a lampoon yet I spoke openly because I do not wish to conceal that I am no friend to gaming"  After this he took up the New Bath Guide and read it with me till supper time In our way down stairs Lady Louisa said  "I thought Brother you were engaged this evening"  "Yes Sister"  answered he  "and I  have  been engaged"  And he bowed to me with an air of gallantry that rather confused me  September d  Almost insensibly have three days glided on since I wrote last and so serenely that but for your absence I could not have formed a wish My residence here is much happier than I had dared expect The attention with which Lord Orville honours me is as uniform as it is flattering and seems to result from a benevolence of heart that proves him as much a stranger to caprice as to pride for as his particular civilities arose from a generous resentment at seeing me neglected so will they I trust continue as long as I shall in any degree deserve them I am now not merely easy but even gay in his presence such is the effect of true politeness that it banishes all restraint and embarrassment When we walk out he condescends to be my companion and keeps by my side all the way we go When we read he marks the passages most worthy to be noticed draws out my sentiments and favours me with his own At table where he always sits next to me he obliges me by a thousand nameless attentions while the distinguishing goodbreeding  with which he treats me prevents my repining at the visiblyfelt superiority of the rest of the company A thousand occasional meetings could not have brought us to that degree of social freedom which four days spent under the same roof have insensibly been productive of and as my only friend in this house Mrs Selwyn is too much engrossed in perpetual conversation to attend much to me Lord Orville seems to regard me as a helpless stranger and as such to think me entitled to his good offices and protection Indeed my dear Sir I have reason to hope that the depreciating opinion he formerly entertained of me is succeeded by one infinitely more partialIt may be that I flatter myself but yet his looks his attentions his desire of drawing me into conversation and his solicitude to oblige me all conspire to make me hope I do not In short my dearest Sir these last four happy days would repay me for months of sorrow and pain  LETTER XX  Evelina in continuation  Clifton  Sept th  THIS morning I came down stairs very early and supposing that the family would not assemble for some time I strolled out purposing to take a long walk in the manner I was wont to do at Berry Hill before breakfast But I had scarce shut the garden gate ere I was met by a gentleman who immediately bowing to me I recollected  to be the unhappy Mr Macartney Very much surprised I courtsied and stopped till he came up to me He was still in mourning but looked better than when I saw him last though he had the same air of melancholy which so much struck me at first sight of him  Addressing me with the utmost respect  "I am happy Madam"  said he  "to have met with you so soon I came to Bristol but yesterday and have had no small difficulty in tracing you to Clifton"  "Did you know then of my being here"  "I did Madam the sole motive of my journey was to see you I have been to Berry Hill and there I had my intelligence and at the same time the unwelcome information of your ill health"  "Good God Sirand can you possibly have taken so much trouble  "Trouble Oh Madam could there be any to return you the moment I had the power my personal acknowledgments for your goodness"  I then enquired after Madame Duval and the SnowHill family He told me they were all well and that Madame Duval proposed soon returning to Paris When I congratulated him upon looking better  "It is  yourself  Madam"  said he  "you should congratulate for to your humanity alone it may now be owing that I exist at all"  He then told me that his affairs were now in a less desperate situation and that he hoped by the assistance of time and reason to accommodate his mind to a more chearful submission to his fate  "The interest you so generously took in my affliction"  added he  "assures me you will not be displeased to hear of my better fortune I  was therefore eager to acquaint you with it"  He then told me that his friend the moment he had received his letter quitted Paris and flew to give him his personal assistance and consolation With a heavy heart he acknowledged he accepted it  "but yet"  he added  "I  have  accepted it and therefore as bound equally by duty and honour my first step was to hasten to the benefactress of my distress and to return"  presenting me something in a paper  "the only part of my obligations that  can  be returned for the rest I have nothing but my gratitude to offer and must always be contented to consider myself her debtor"  I congratulated him most sincerely upon his dawning prosperity but begged he would not deprive me of the pleasure of being his friend and declined receiving the money till his affairs were more settled  While this point was in agitation I heard Lord Orville's voice enquiring of the gardener if he had seen me I immediately opened the gardengate and his Lordship advancing to me with quickness said  "Good God Miss Anville have you been out alone Breakfast has been ready some time and I have been round the garden in search of you"  "Your Lordship has been very good"  said I  "but I hope you have not waited"  "Not waited"  repeated he smiling  "Do you think we could sit down quietly to breakfast with the idea that you had run away from us But come"  offering to hand me  "if we do not return they will suppose  I  am run away too and they very naturally may as they know the attraction of the magnet that draws me"  "I will come my Lord"  said I rather embarrassed  "in two minutes"  Then turning to Mr Macartney with yet more embarrassment I wished him good morning  He advanced towards the garden with the paper still in his hand  "No no"  cried I  "some other time"  "May I then Madam have the honour of seeing you again  I did not dare take the liberty of inviting any body to the house of Mrs Beaumont nor yet had I the presence of mind to make an excuse and therefore not knowing how to refuse him I said  "Perhaps you may be this way again tomorrow morningand I believe I shall walk out before breakfast"  He bowed and went away while I turning again to Lord Orville saw his countenance so much altered that I was srightened at what I had so hastily said He did not again offer me his hand but walked silent and slow by my side Good Heaven thought I what may he not suppose from this adventure May he not by my desire of meeting Mr Macartney tomorrow imagine it was by design I walked out to meet him today Tormented by this apprehension I determined to avail myself of the freedom which his behaviour since I came hither has encouraged and since he would not ask any questions begin an explanation myself I therefore slackened my peace to gain time and then said  "Was not your Lordship surprised to see me speaking with a stranger"  "A stranger'  repeated he  "is it possible that gentleman can be a stranger to you"  "No my Lord"  said I stammering  "not to  me  but only it might lookhe might seem"  "No believe me"  said he with a forced smile  "I could never believe Miss Anville would make an appointment with a stranger"  "An appointment my Lord"  repeated I colouring violently  "Pardon me Madam"  answered he  "but I thought I heard one"  I was so much confounded that I could not speak yet finding he walked quietly on I could not endure he should make his own interpretation of my silence and therefore as soon as I recovered from my surprise I said  "Indeed my Lord you are much mistakenMr Macartney had particular business with meand I could notI knew not how to refuse seeing himbut indeed my LordI had nothe had not"  I stammered so terribly that I could not go on  "I am very sorry"  said he gravely  "that I have been so unfortunate as to distress you but I should not have followed you had I not imagined you were merely walked out for the air"  "And so I was"  cried I eagerly  "indeed my Lord I was My meeting with Mr Macartney was quite accidental and if your Lordship thinks there is any impropriety in my seeing him tomorrow I am ready to give up that intention"  "If  I  think"  said he in a tone of surprise  "surely Miss Anville must best judge for herself surely she cannot leave the arbitration of a point so delicate to one who is ignorant of all the circumstances which attend it  "If"  said I  "it was worth your Lordship's time to hear themyou should  not  be ignorant of the circumstances which attend it"  "The sweetness of Miss Anville's disposition"  said he in a softened voice  "I have long admired and the offer of a communication which does me so much honour is too grateful to me not to be eagerly caught at"  Just then Mrs Selwyn opened the parlourwindow and our conversation ended I was rallied upon my passion for solitary walking but no questions were asked me  When breakfast was over I hoped to have had some opportunity of speaking with Lord Orville but Lord Merton and Mr Coverly came in and insisted upon his opinion of the spot they had fixed upon for the old women's race The ladies declared they would be of the party and accordingly we all went  The race is to be run in Mrs Beaumont's garden the two gentlemen are as anxious as if their joint lives depended upon it They have at length fixed upon objects but have found great difficulty in persuading them to practise running in order to try their strength This grand affair is to be decided next Thursday  When we returned to the house the entrance of more company still prevented my having any conversation with Lord Orville I was very much chagrined as I knew he was engaged at the Hotwells in the afternoon Seeing therefore no probability of speaking to him before the time of my meeting Mr Macartney arrived I determined that rather than risk his ill opinion I would leave Mr Macartney to his own suggestions  Yet when I reflected upon his peculiar situation his misfortunes his sadness and more than all the rest the idea I knew he entertained of what he calls his obligations to me I could not resolve upon a breach of promise which might be  attributed to causes of all others the most offensive to one whom sorrow has made extremely suspicious of slights and contempt  After the most uneasy consideration I at length determined upon writing an excuse which would at once save me from either meeting or affronting him I therefore begged Mrs Selwyn's leave to send her man to the Hotwells which she instantly granted and then I wrote the following note  To Mr Macartney  Sir  AS it will not be in my power to walk out tomorrow morning I would by no means give you the trouble of coming to Clifton I hope however to have the pleasure of seeing you before you quit Bristol I am  Sir  Your obedient servant EVELINA ANVILLE  I desired the servant to enquire at the pumproom where Mr Macartney lived and returned to the parlour  As soon as the company dispersed the ladies retired to dress I then unexpectedly found myself alone with Lord Orville who the moment I rose to follow Mrs Selwyn advanced to me and said  "Will Miss Anville pardon my impatience if I remind her of the promise she was so good as to make me this morning"  I stopped and would have returned to my seat but before I had time the servants came to lay the cloth He retreated and went towards the window and while I was considering in what  manner to begin I could not help asking myself what  right  I had to communicate the affairs of Mr Macartney and I doubted whether to clear myself from one act of imprudence I had not commited another  Distressed by this reflection I thought it best to quit the room and give myself some time for consideration before I spoke and therefore only saying I must hasten to dress I ran up stairs rather abruptly I own and so I fear Lord Orville must think yet what could I do unused to the situations in which I find myself and embarrassed by the slightest difficulties I seldom till too late discover how I ought to act  Just as we were all assembled to dinner Mrs Selwyn's man coming into the parlour presented to me a letter and said  "I can't find out Mr Macartney Madam but the postoffice people will let you know if they hear of him"  I was extremely ashamed of this public message and meeting the eyes of Lord Orville which were earnestly fixed on me my confusion redoubled and I knew not which way to look All dinnertime he was as silent as myself and the moment it was in my power I left the table and went to my own room Mrs Selwyn presently followed me and her questions obliged me to own almost all the particulars of my acquaintance with Mr Macartney in order to excuse my writing to him She said it was a most romantic affair and spoke her sentiments with great severity declaring that she had no doubt but he was an adventurer and an impostor  And now my dear Sir I am totally at a loss what I ought to do the more I reflect the more sensible I am of the utter impropriety nay treachery of revealing the story and publishing  the misfortunes and poverty of Mr Macartney who has an undoubted right to my secrecy and discretion and whose letter charges me to regard his communication as sacredAnd yet the appearance of mysteryperhaps something worse which this affair must have to Lord Orvillehis seriousnessand the promise I have made him are inducements scarce to be resisted for trusting him with the openness he has reason to expect from me  I am equally distressed too whether or not I should see Mr Macartney tomorrow morning  Oh Sir could I now be enlightened by your counsel from what anxiety and perplexity should I be relieved  But noI ought not to betray Mr Macartney and I will not forfeit a confidence which would never have been reposed in me but from a reliance upon my honour which I should blush to find myself unworthy of Desirous as I am of the good opinion of Lord Orville I will endeavour to act as if I was guided by your advice and making it my sole aim to  deserve  it leave to time and to fate my success or disappointment  Since I have formed this resolution my mind is more at ease but I will not finish my letter till the affair is decided  Sept th  I rose very early this morning and after a thousand different plans not being able to resolve upon giving poor Mr Macartney leave to suppose I neglected him I thought it incumbent upon me to keep my word since he had not received my letter I therefore determined to make my own  apologies not to stay with him two minutes and to excuse myself from meeting him any more  Yet uncertain whether I was wrong or right it was with fear and trembling that I opened the gardengatejudge then of my feelings when the first object I saw was Lord Orvillehe too looked extremely disconcerted and said in a he sitating manner  "Pardon me MadamI did not imagine you would have been here so soonoror I would not have come"  And then with a hasty bow he passed me and proceeded to the garden  I was scarce able to stand so greatly did I feel myself shocked but upon my saying almost involuntarily  "Oh my Lord"  he turned back and after a short pause said  "Did you speak to  me  Madam"  I could not immediately answer I seemed  choaked  and was even forced to support myself by the gardengate  Lord Orville soon recovering his dignity said  "I know not how to apologise for being just now at this placeand I cannot immediatelyif  ever  clear myself from the imputation of impertinent curiosity to which I fear you will attribute it however I will at present only entreat your pardon without detaining you any longer"  Again he bowed and left me  For some moments I remained fixed to the same spot and in the same position immovably as if I had been transformed to stone  My first impulse was to call him back and instantly tell him the whole affair but I checked this desire though I would have given the world to have indulged it something like pride aided what I thought due to Mr Macartney and I determined not only to keep his secret but to delay  any sort of explanation till Lord Orville should condescend to request it  Slowly he walked and before he entered the house he looked back but hastily withdrew his eyes upon finding I observed him  Indeed my dear Sir you cannot easily imagine a situation more uncomfortable than mine was at that time to be suspected by Lord Orville of any clandestine actions wounded my soul I was too much discomposed to wait for Mr Macartney nor in truth could I endure to have the design of my staying so well known Yet so extremely was I agitated that I could hardly move and I have reason to believe Lord Orville from the parlour window saw me tottering along for before I had taken five steps he came out and hastening to me said  "I fear you are not well pray allow me offering his arm to assist you"  "No my Lord"  said I with all the resolution I could assume yet I was affected by an attention at that time so little expected and forced to turn away my head to conceal my emotion  "You  must  "  said he with earnestness  "indeed you mustI am sure you are not wellrefuse me not the honour of assisting you  and almost forcibly he took my hand and drawing it under his arm obliged me to lean upon him That I submitted was partly the effect of surprise at an earnestness so uncommon in Lord Orville and partly that I did not just then dare trust my voice to make any objection  When we came to the house he led me into the parlour and to a chair and begged to know if I would not have a glass of water  "No my Lord I thank you"  said I  "I am perfectly recovered"  and rising I walked to the window where for some time I pretended to be occupied in looking at the garden  Determined as I was to act honourably by Mr Macartney I yet most anxiously wished to be restored to the good opinion of Lord Orville but his silence and the thoughtfulness of his air discouraged me from speaking  My situation soon grew disagreeable and embarrassing and I resolved to return to my chamber till breakfast was ready To remain longer I feared might seem  asking  for his enquiries and I was sure it would ill become me to be more eager to speak than he was to hear  Just as I reached the door turning to me hastily he said  "Are you going Miss Anville"  "I am my Lord"  answered I yet I stopped  "Perhaps to return tobut I beg your pardon"  he spoke with a degree of agitation that made me readily comprehend he meant to  the garden  and I instantly said  "To my own room my Lord"  And again I would have gone but convinced by my answer that I understood him I believe he was sorry for the insinuation he approached me with a very serious air though at the same time he forced a smile and said  "I know not what evil genius pursues me this morning but I seem destined to do or say something I ought not I am so much ashamed of myself that I can scarce solicit your forgiveness"  "My forgiveness my Lord"  cried I abashed rather than elated by his condescension  "surely you cannotyou are not serious"  "Indeed never more so yet if I may be my own interpreter Miss Anville's countenance pronounces my pardon"  "I know not my Lord how any one can pardon who has never been offended"  "You are very good yet I could expect no less from a sweetness of disposition which baffles all comparison will you not think I am an encroacher and that I take advantage of your goodness should I once more remind you of the promise you vouchsafed me yesterday"  "No indeed on the contrary I shall be very happy to acquit myself in your Lordship's opinion"  "Acquittal you need not"  said he leading me again to the window  "yet I own my curiosity is strongly excited"  When I was seated I found myself much at a los what to say yet after a short silence assuming all the courage in my power  "Will you not my Lord"  said I  "think me trifling and capricious should I own I have repented the promise I made and should I entreat your Lordship not to insist upon my strict performance of itI spoke so hastily that I did not at the time consider the impropriety of what I said"  As he was entirely silent and profoundly attentive I continued to speak without interruption  "If your Lordship by any other means knew the circumstances attending my acquaintance with Mr Macartney I am most sure you would yourself disapprove my relating them He is a gentleman and has been very unfortunatebut I am notI think notat liberty to say more yet I am sure if he knew your Lordship  wished to hear any particulars of his affairs he would readily consent to my acknowledging themshall my Lord ask his permission"  "  His  affairs"  repeated Lord Orville  "by no means I have not the least curiosity about them"  "I beg your Lordship's pardonbut indeed I had understood the contrary"  "Is it possible Madam you could suppose the affairs of an utter stranger can excite my curiosity"  The gravity and coldness with which he asked this question very much abashed me but Lord Orville is the most delicate of men and presently recollecting himself he added  "I mean not to speak with indifference of any friend of yoursfar from it any such will always command my good wishes yet I own I am rather disappointed and though I doubt not the justice of your reasons to which I implicitly submit you must not wonder that when upon the point of being honoured with your confidence I should feel the greatest regret at finding it withdrawn"  Do you think my dear Sir I did not at that moment require all my resolution to guard me from frankly telling him whatever he wished to hear yet I rejoice that I did not for added to the actual wrong I should have done Lord Orville himself when he had heard would I am sure have blamed me Fortunately this thought occurred to me and I said  "Your Lordship shall yourself be my judge the promise I made though voluntary was rash and inconsiderate yet had it concerned myself I would not have hesitated in fulfilling it but the gentleman whose affairs I should be obliged to relate"  "Pardon me"  cried he  "for interrupting you yet allow me to assure you I have not the slightest desire to be acquainted with his affairs further than what belongs to the motives which induced you yesterday morning"  He stopped but there was no occasion to say more  "That my Lord"  cried I  "I will tell you honesty Mr Macartney had some particular business with meand I could not take the liberty to ask him hither"  "And why notMrs Beaumont I am sure"  "I could not my Lord think of intruding upon Mrs Beaumont's complaisance and so with the same hasty folly I promised your Lordship I much  more  rashly promised to meet him"  "And did you"  "No my Lord"  said I colouring  "I returned before he came"  Again for some time we were both silent yet unwilling to leave him to reflections which could not but be to my disadvantage I summoned sufficient courage to say  "There is no young creature my Lord who so greatly wants or so earnestly wishes for the advice and assistance of her friends as I do I am new to the world and unused to acting for myselfmy intentions are never wilfully blameable yet I err perpetuallyI have hitherto been blest with the most affectionate of friends and indeed the ablest of men to guide and instruct me upon every occasionbut he is too distant now to be applied to at the moment I want his aid and  here  there is not a human being whose counsel I can ask"  "Would to Heaven"  cried he with a countenance from which all coldness and gravity were  banished and succeeded by the mildest benevolence  "that  I  were worthyand capableof supplying the place of such a friend to Miss Anville"  "You do me but too much honour"  said I  "yet I hope your Lordship's candourperhaps I ought to say indulgencewill make some allowance on account of my inexperience for behaviour so inconsiderateMay I my Lord hope that you will"  "May  I  "  cried he  "hope that you will pardon the illgrace with which I have submitted to my disappointment and that you will permit me"  kissing my hand  "thus to seal my peace"  "  Our  peace my Lord"  said I with revived spirits  "This then"  said he again pressing it to his lips  "for  our  peace and noware we not friends"  Just then the door opened and I had only time to withdraw my hand ere the ladies came in to breakfast  I have been all day the happiest of human beingsto be thus reconciled to Lord Orville and yet to adhere to my resolutionwhat could I wish for morehe too has been very chearful and more attentive more obliging to me than ever Yet Heaven forbid I should again be in a similar situation for I cannot express how much uneasiness I have suffered from the fear of incurring his ill opinion  But what will poor Mr Macartney think of me happy as I am I much regret the necessity I have been under of disappointing him  Adieu my dearest Sir  LETTER XXI  Mr Villars to Evelina  Berry Hill  Sept  DEAD to the world and equally insensible to its pleasures or its pains I long since bid adieu to all joy and defiance to all sorrow but what should spring from my Evelinasole source to me of all earthly felicity How strange then is it that the letter in which she tells me she is the  happiest of human beings  should give me the most mortal inquietude  Alas my childthat innocence the first best gift of Heaven should of all others be the blindest to its own dangerthe most exposed to treacheryand the least able to defend itself in a world where it is little known less valued and perpetually deceived  Would to Heaven you were herethen by degrees and with gentleness I might enter upon a subject too delicate for distant discussion Yet it is too interesting and the situation too critical to allow of delayOh my Evelina your situation is critical indeedyour peace of mind is at stake and every chance for your future happiness may depend upon the conduct of the present moment  Hitherto I have forborne to speak with you upon the most important of all concerns the state of your heartalas I needed no information I have been silent indeed but I have not been blind  Long and with the deepest regret have I perceived  the ascendency which Lord Orville has gained upon your mindYou will start at the mention of his nameyou will tremble every word you readI grieve to give pain to my gentle Evelina but I dare not any longer spare her  Your first meeting with Lord Orville was decisive Lively fearless free from all other impressions such a man as you describe him could not fail exciting your admiration and the more dangerously because he seemed as unconscious of his power as you of your weakness and therefore you had no alarm either from  his  vanity or  your own  prudence  Young animated entirely off your guard and thoughtless of consequences  imagination  took the reins and  reason  slowpaced though surefooted was unequal to a race with so eccentric and flighty a companion How rapid was then my Evelina's progress through those regions of fancy and passion whither her new guide conducted herShe saw Lord Orville at a balland he was  the most amiable of men  She met him again at anotherand  he had every virtue under Heaven  I mean not to depreciate the merit of Lord Orville who one mysterious instance alone excepted seems to have deserved the idea you formed of his character but it was not time it was not the knowledge of his worth obtained your regard your new comrade had not patience to wait any trial her glowing pencil dipt in the vivid colours of her creative ideas painted to you at the moment of your first acquaintance all the excellencies all the good and rare qualities which a great length of time and intimacy could alone have really discovered  You flattered yourself that your partiality was the effect of esteem founded upon a general love  of merit and a principle of justice and your heart which fell the sacrifice of your error was totally gone ere you suspected it was in danger  A thousand times have I been upon the point of shewing you the perils of your situation but the same inexperience which occasioned your mistake I hoped with the assistance of time and absence would effect a cure I was indeed most unwilling to destroy your illusion while I dared hope it might itself contribute to the restoration of your tranquillity since your ignorance of the danger and force of your attachment might possibly prevent that despondency with which young people in similar circumstances are apt to persuade themselves that what is only difficult is absolutely impossible  But now since you have again met and are become more intimate than ever all my hope from silence and seeming ignorance is at an end  Awake then my dear my deluded child awake to the sense of your danger and exert yourself to avoid the evils with which it threatens youevils which to a mind like yours are most to be dreaded secret repining and concealed yet consuming regret Make a noble effort for the recovery of your peace which now with sorrow I see it depends wholly upon the presence of Lord Orville This effort may indeed be painful but trust to my experience when I assure you it is requisite  You must quit himhis sight is baneful to your repose his society is death to your future tranquillity Believe me my beloved child my heart aches for your suffering while it dictates its necessity  Could I flatter myself that Lord Orville would indeed be sensible of your worth and act with a  nobleness of mind which should prove it reciprocal then would I leave my Evelina to the unmolested enjoyment of the chearful society and increasing regard of a man she so greatly admires but this is not an age in which we may trust to appearances and imprudence is much sooner regretted than repaired Your health you tell me is much mendedcan you then consent to leave Bristolnot abruptly that I do not desire but in a few days from the time you receive this I will write to Mrs Selwyn and tell her how much I wish your return and Mrs Clinton can take sufficient care of you  I have meditated upon every possible expedient that might tend to your happiness ere I fixed upon exacting from you a compliance which I am convinced will be most painful to you but I can satisfy myself in none This will at least be safe and as to successwe must leave it to time  I am very glad to hear of Mr Macartney's welfare  Adieu my dearest child Heaven preserve and strengthen you  A V  LETTER XXII  Evelina to the Rev Mr Villars  Clifton  Sept  SWEETLY most sweetly have two days more passed since I wrote but I have been too much engaged to be exact in my journal  Today has been less tranquil It was destined for the decision of the important bet and has been productive of general confusion throughout the house It was settled that the race should be run at five o'clock in the afternoon Lord Merton breakfasted here and stayed till noon He wanted to engage the ladies to  bet on his side  in the true spirit of gaming without seeing the racers But he could only prevail on Lady Louisa as Mrs Selwyn said she never laid a wager against her own wishes and Mrs Beaumont would not  take sides  As for  me  I was not applied to It is impossible for negligence to be more pointed than that of Lord Merton to me in the presence of Lady Louisa  But just before dinner I happened to be alone in the drawingroom when his Lordship suddenly returned and coming in with his usual familiarity he was beginning  "You see Lady Louisa"  but stopping short  "Pray where's every body gone"  "Indeed I don't know my Lord"  He then shut the door and with a great alteration in his face and manner advanced eagerly towards me and said  "How glad I am my sweet girl to meet you at last alone By my soul I began to think there was a plot against me for I've never been able to have you a minute to myself"  And very freely he seized my hand  I was so much surprised at this address after having been so long totally neglected that I could make no other answer than staring at him with unfeigned astonishment  "Why now"  continued he  "if you was not the cruellest little angel in the world you would have helped me to some expedient for you see how I am watched here Lady Louisa's  eyes are never off me She gives me a charming foretaste of the pleasures of a wife however it won't last long"  Disgusted to the greatest degree I attempted to draw away my hand but I believe I should not have succeeded had not Mrs Beaumont made her appearance He turned from me with the greatest assurance and said  "How are you Ma'amhow is Lady Louisayou see I can't live a moment out of the house"  Could you my dearest Sir have believed it possible for such effrontery to be in man  Before dinner came Mr Coverley and before five o'clock Mr Lovel and some other company The place marked out for the race was a gravelwalk in Mrs Beaumont's garden and the length of the ground twenty yards When we were summoned to the  course  the two poor old women made their appearance Though they seemed very healthy for their time of life they yet looked so weak so infirm so feeble that I could feel no sensation but that of pity at the sight However this was not the general sense of the company for they no sooner came forward than they were greeted with a laugh from every beholder Lord Orville excepted who looked very grave during the whole transaction Doubtless he must be greatly discontented at the dissipated conduct and extravagance of a man with whom he is soon to be so nearly connected  For some time the scene was truly ridiculous the agitation of the parties concerned and the bets that were laid upon the old women were absurd beyond measure  Who are you for  and  whose side are you of  was echoed from mouth to mouth by the whole company Lord Merton and Mr Coverley were both so excessively gay and noisy  that I soon found they had been too free in drinking to their success They handed with loud shouts the old women to the raceground and encouraged them by liberal promises to exert themselves  When the signal was given them to set off the poor creatures seeble and frightened ran against each other and neither of them able to support the shock they both fell on the ground  Lord Merton and Mr Coverley flew to their assistance Seats were brought for them and they each drank a glass of wine They complained of being much bruised for heavy and helpless they had not been able to save themselves but fell with their whole weight upon the gravel However as they seemed equal sufferers both parties were too eager to have the affair deferred  Again therefore they set off and hobbled along nearly even with each other for some time yet frequently and to the inexpressible diversion of the company they stumbled and tottered and the confused hallowing of  "  Now Coverley  "  "  Now Merton  "  rung from side to side during the whole affair  Not long after a foot of one of the poor women slipt and with great force she came again to the ground Involuntarily I sprung forward to assist her but Lord Merton to whom she did not belong stopped me calling out  "No foul play no foul play"  Mr Coverley then repeating the same words went himself to help her and insisted that the other should stop A debate ensued but the poor creature was too much hurt to move and declared her utter inability to make another attempt Mr Coverley was quite brutal he swore  at her with unmanly rage and seemed scarce able to refrain even from striking her  Lord Merton then in great rapture said it was a  hollow thing  but Mr Coverley contended that the fall was accidental and time should be allowed for the woman to recover However all the company being against him he was pronounced the loser  We then went to the drawingroom to tea After which the evening being delightful we all walked in the garden Lord Merton was quite riotous and Lady Louisa in high spirits but Mr Coverley endeavoured in vain to conceal his chagrin  As Lord Orville was thoughtful and walked by himself I expected that as usual  I  should pass unnoticed and be left to my own meditations but this was not the case for Lord Merton entirely off his guard giddy equally from wine and success was very troublesome to me and regardless of the presence of Lady Louisa which hitherto has restrained him even from common civility he attached himself to me during the walk with a freedom of gallantry that put me extremely out of countenance He paid me the most highflown compliments and frequently and forcibly seized my hand though I repeatedly and with undissembled anger drew it back Lord Orville I saw watched us with earnestness and Lady Louisa's smiles were converted into looks of disdain  I could not bear to be thus situated and complaining I was tired I quickened my pace with intention to return to the house but Lord Merton hastily following caught my hand and saying the  day was his own  vowed he would not let me go  "You  must  my Lord"  cried I extremely flurried  "You are the most charming girl in the world"  said he  "and never looked better than at this moment"  "My Lord"  cried Mrs Selwyn advancing to us  "you don't consider that the better Miss Anville looks the more striking is the contrast with your Lordship therefore for your own sake I would advise you not to hold her"  "Egad my Lord"  cried Mr Coverley  "I don't see what right you have to the best  old  and the best  young  woman too in the same day"  "  Best young woman  "  repeated Mr Lovel  "'pon honour Jack you have made a most unfortunate speech however if Lady Louisa can pardon youand her Ladyship is all goodnessI am sure nobody else can for you have committed an outrageous solecism in good manners"  "And pray Sir"  said Mrs Selwyn  "under what denomination may your own speech pass"  Mr Lovel turning another way affected not to hear her and Mr Coverley bowing to Lady Louisa said  "Her Ladyship is well acquainted with my devotionbut egad I don't know how it isI had always an unlucky turn at an epigram and never could resist a smart play upon words in my life"  "Pray my Lord"  cried I  "let go my hand pray Mrs Selwyn speak for me"  "My Lord"  said Mrs Selwyn  "in detaining Miss Anville any longer you only lose time for we are already as well convinced of your valour  and your strength as if you were to hold her an age"  "My Lord"  said Mrs Beaumont  "I must beg leave to interfere I know not if Lady Louisa can pardon you but as this young Lady is at my house I do not chuse to have her made uneasy"  "  I  pardon him"  cried Lady Louisa  "I declare I am monstrous glad to get rid of him"  "Egad my Lord"  cried Mr Coverley  "while you are grasping at a shadow you'll lose a substance you'd best make your peace while you can"  "Pray Mr Coverley be quiet"  said Lady Louisa peevishly  "for I declare I won't speak to him Brother"  taking hold of Lord Orville's arm  "will you walk in with me"  "Would to Heaven"  cried I frightened to see how much Lord Merton was in liquor  "that I too had a brotherand then I should not be exposed to such treatment"  Lord Orville instantly quitting Lady Louisa said  "Will Miss Anville allow  me  the honour of taking that title"  and then without waiting for any answer he disengaged me from Lord Merton and handing me to Lady Louisa  "Let me"  added he  "take equal care of  both  my sisters"  and then desiring her to take hold of one arm and begging me to make use of the other we reached the house in a moment Lord Merton disordered as he was attempted not to stop us  As soon as we entered the house I withdrew my arm and courtsied my thanks for my heart was too full for speech Lady Louisa evidently hurt at her brother's condescension and piqued extremely by Lord Merton's behaviour silently  drew away her's and biting her lips with a look of infinite vexation walked sullenly up the hall  Lord Orville asked her if she would not go into the parlour  "No"  answered she haughtily  "I leave you and your new sister together"  and then she walked up stairs  I was quite confounded at the pride and rudeness of this speech Lord Orville himself seemed thunderstruck I turned from him and went into the parlour he followed me saying  "Must I now apologise to Miss Anville for the liberty of my interferenceor ought I to apologise that I did not as I wished interfere sooner"  "O my Lord"  cried I with an emotion I could not repress  "it is from you alone I meet with any respectall others treat me with impertinence or contempt"  I am sorry I had not more command of myself as he had reason just then to suppose I particularly meant his sister which I am sure must very much hurt him  "Good Heaven"  cried he  "that so much sweetness and merit can fail to excite the love and admiration so justly their due I cannotI dare not express to you half the indignation I feel at this moment"  "I am sorry my Lord"  said I more calmly  "to have raised it but yetin a situation that calls for protection to meet only with mortificationsindeed I am but ill formed to bear them"  "My  dear  Miss Anville"  cried he warmly  "allow  me  to be your friend think of me as if I were indeed your brother and let me entreat you to accept my best services if there is any thing in  which I can be so happy as to shew my regardmy respect for you"  Before I had time to speak the rest of the party entered the parlour and as I did not wish to see any thing more of Lord Merton at least before he had slept I determined to leave it Lord Orville seeing my design said as I passed him  "Will you go"  "Had not I best my Lord"  said I  "I am afraid"  said he smiling  "since I must now speak as your  brother  I am afraid you  had  you see you may trust me since I can advise against my own interest"  I then left the room and have been writing ever since And methinks I can never lament the rudeness of Lord Merton as it has more than ever confirmed to me the esteem of Lord Orville  LETTER XXIII  Evelina in continuation  Sept  OH Sir what a strange incident have I to recite what a field of conjecture to open  Yesterday evening we all went to an assembly Lord Orville presented tickets to the whole family and did me the honour to the no small surprise of all here I believe to dance with me But every day abounds in fresh instances of his condescending politeness and he now takes every opportunity of calling me his  friend  and his  sister  Lord Merton offered a ticket to Lady Louisa but she was so much incensed against him that she refused it with the utmost disdain neither could he prevail upon her to dance with him she sat still the whole evening and deigned not to look at or speak to him To me her behaviour is almost the same for she is cold distant and haughty and her eyes express the greatest contempt But for Lord Orville how miserable would my residence here make me  We were joined in the ballroom by Mr Coverley Mr Lovel and Lord Merton who looked as if he was doing penance and sat all the evening next to Lady Louisa vainly endeavouring to appease her anger  Lord Orville began the minuets he danced with a young Lady who seemed to engage the general attention as she had not been seen here before She is pretty and looks mild and goodhumoured  "Pray Mr Lovel"  said Lady Louisa  "who is that"  "Miss Belmont"  answered he  "the young heiress she came to the Wells yesterday"  Struck with the name I involuntarily repeated it but nobody heard me  "What is her family"  said Mrs Beaumont  "Have you not heard of her Ma'am"  cried he  "she is only daughter and heiress of Sir John Belmont"  Good Heaven how did I start the name struck my ear like a thunderbolt Mrs Selwyn who immediately looked at me said  "Be calm my dear and we will learn the truth of all this"  Till then I had never imagined her to be acquainted with my story but she has since told me that she knew my unhappy mother and was well informed of the whole affair  She asked Mr Lovel a multitude of questions and I gathered from his answers that this young Lady was just come from abroad with Sir John Belmont who was now in London that she was under the care of his sister Mrs Paterson and that she would inherit a considerable estate  I cannot express the strange feelings with which I was agitated during this recital What my dearest Sir can it possibly mean Did you ever hear of any aftermarriageor must I suppose that while the lawful child is rejected another is adoptedI know not what to think I am bewildered with a contrariety of ideas  When we came home Mrs Selwyn passed more than an hour in my room conversing upon this subject She says that I ought instantly to go to town find out my father and have the affair cleared up She assures me I have too strong a resemblance to my dear though unknown mother to allow of the least hesitation in my being owned when once I am seen For my part I have no wish but to act by your direction  I can give no account of the evening so disturbed so occupied am I by this subject that I can think of no other I have entreated Mrs Selwyn to observe the strictest secrecy and she has promised that she will Indeed she has too much sense to be idly communicative  Lord Orville took notice of my being absent and silent but I ventured not to entrust him with the cause Fortunately he was not of the party at the time Mr Lovel made the discovery  Mrs Selwyn says that if you approve my going to town she will herself accompany me I had a thousand times rather ask the protection of Mrs Mirvan but after this offer that will not be possible  Adieu my dearest Sir I am sure you will write immediately and I shall be all impatience till your letter arrives  LETTER XXIV  Evelina in continuation  Oct st  GOOD God my dear Sir what a wonderful tale have I again to relate even yet I am not recovered from my extreme surprise  Yesterday morning as soon as I had finished my hasty letter I was summoned to attend a walking party to the Hotwells It consisted only of Mrs Selwyn and Lord Orville The latter walked by my side all the way and his conversation dissipated my uneasiness and insensibly restored my serenity  At the pumproom I saw Mr Macartney I courtsied to him twice ere he would speak to me When he did I began to apologise for having disappointed him but I did not find it very easy to excuse myself as Lord Orville's eyes with an expression of anxiety that distressed me turned from him to me and me to him every word I spoke Convinced however that I had really trifled with  Mr Macartney I scrupled not to beg his pardon He was then not merely appeased but even grateful  He requested me to see him tomorrow but I had not the folly to be again guilty of an indiscretion which had already caused me so much uneasiness and therefore I told him frankly that it was not in my power at present to see him but by accident and to prevent his being offended I hinted to him the reason I could not receive him as I wished to do  When I had satisfied both him and myself upon this subject I turned to Lord Orville and saw with concern the gravity of his countenance I would have spoken to him but knew not how I believe however he read my thoughts for in a little time with a sort of serious smile he said  "Does not Mr Macartney complain of his disappointment"  "Not much my Lord"  "And how have you appeased him"  Finding I hesitated what to answer  "Am I not your brother"  continued he  "and must I not enquire into your affairs"  "Certainly my Lord"  said I laughing  "I only wish it were better worth your Lordship's while"  "Let me then make immediate use of my privilege When shall you see Mr Macartney again"  "Indeed my Lord I can't tell"  "Butdo you know that I shall not suffer  my sister  to make a private appointment"  "Pray my Lord"  cried I earnestly  "use that word no more indeed you shock me extremely"  "That would I not do for the world"  cried he  "yet you know not how warmly how deeply I am interested not only in all your concerns but in all your actions"  This speechthe most particular one Lord Orville had ever made to me ended our conversation for that time for I was too much struck by it to make any answer  Soon after Mr Macartney in a low voice entreated me not to deny him the gratification of returning the money While he was speaking the young Lady I saw yesterday at the assembly with a large party entered the pumproom Mr Macartney turned as pale as death his voice faltered and he seemed not to know what he said I was myself almost equally disturbed by the croud of confused ideas that occured to me Good Heaven thought I why should he be thus agitatedis it possible this can be the young Lady he loved  In a few minutes we quitted the pumproom and though I twice wished Mr Macartney good morning he was so absent he did not hear me  We did not immediately return to Clifton as Mrs Selwyn had business at a pamphletshop While she was looking at some new poems Lord Orville again asked me when I should see Mr Macartney  "Indeed my Lord"  cried I  "I know not but I would give the universe for a few moments conversation with him"  I spoke this with a simple sincerity and was not aware of the force of my own words  "The universe"  repeated he  "Good God Miss Anville do you say this to  me  "  "I would say it"  returned I  "to any body my Lord"  "I beg your pardon"  said he in a voice that shewed him ill pleased  "I am answered"  "My Lord"  cried I  "you must not judge hardly of me I spoke inadvertently but if you knew the painful suspence I suffer at this moment you would not be surprised at what I have said"  "And would a meeting with Mr Macartney relieve you from that suspence"  "Yes my Lord two words might be sufficient"  "Would to Heaven"  cried he after a short pause  "that I were worthy to know their import"  "Worthy my LordO if that were all your Lordship could ask nothing I should not be ready to answer if I were but at liberty to speak I should be  proud  of your Lordship's enquiries but indeed I am not I have no right to communicate the affairs of Mr Macartneyyour Lordship cannot suppose I have"  "I will own to you"  answered he  "I know not  what  to suppose yet there seems a frankness even in your mysteryand such an air of openness in your countenance that I am willing to hope"  He stopped a moment and then added  "This meeting you say is essential to your repose"  "I did not say  that  my Lord but yet I have the most important reasons for wishing to speak to him"  He paused a few minutes and then said with warmth  "Yes you  shall  speak to himI will myself assist youMiss Anville I am sure cannot form a wish against propriety I will ask no questions I will rely upon her own purity and  uninformed blindfold as I am I will serve her with all my power"  and then he went into the shop leaving me so strangely affected by his generous behaviour that I almost wished to follow him with my thanks  When Mrs Selwyn had transacted her affairs we returned home  The moment dinner was over Lord Orville went out and did not come back till just as we were summoned to supper This is the longest time he has spent from the house since I have been at Clifton and you cannot imagine my dear Sir how much I missed him I scarce knew before how infinitely I am indebted to him alone for the happiness I have enjoyed since I have been at Mrs Beaumont's  As I generally go down stairs last he came to me the moment the ladies had passed by and said  "Shall you be at home tomorrow morning"  "I believe so my Lord"  "And will you then receive a visitor for me"  "For you my Lord"  "YesI have made acquaintance with Mr Macartney and he has promised to call upon me tomorrow about three o'clock"  And then taking my hand he led me down stairs  O Sirwas there ever such another man as Lord OrvilleYes  one  other now resides at BerryHill  This morning there has been a great deal of company here but at the time appointed by Lord Orville doubtless with that consideration the parlour is almost always empty as every body is dressing  Mrs Beaumont however was not gone up stairs when Mr Macartney sent in his name  Lord Orville immediately said  "Beg the favour of him to walk in You see Madam that I consider myself as at home  "I hope so"  answered Mrs Beaumont  "or I should be very uneasy"  Mr Macartney then entered I believe we both felt very conscious to whom the visit was paid but Lord Orville received him as his own guest and not merely entertained him as such while Mrs Beaumont remained in the room but for some time after she went a delicacy that saved me from the embarrassment I should have felt had he immediately quitted us  In a few minutes however he gave Mr Macartney a bookfor I too by way of pretence for continuing in the room pretended to be readingand begged he would be so good as to look it over while he answered a note which he would dispatch in a few minutes and return to him  When he was gone we both parted with our books and Mr Macartney again producing the paper with the money besought me to accept it  "Pray  "said I still declining it  "did you know the young lady who came into the pumproom yesterday morning  "Know her"  repeated he changing colour  "Oh but too well"  "Indeed"  Why Madam do you ask"  "I must beseech you to satisfy me further upon this subject pray tell me who she is"  "Inviolably as I meant to keep my secret I can refuse you Madam nothingthat lady  is the daughter of Sir John Belmontof my father"  "Gracious Heaven"  cried I involuntarily laying my hand on his arm  "you are then"  my brother  I would have said but my voice failed me and I burst into tears  "Oh Madam"  cried he  "what can this meanWhat can thus distress you"  I could not answer him but held out my hand to him He seemed greatly surprised and talked in high terms of my condescension  "Spare yourself"  cried I wiping my eyes  "spare yourself this mistakeyou have a  right  to all I can do for you the similarity of our circumstances"  We were then interrupted by the entrance of Mrs Selwyn and Mr Macartney finding no probability of our being left alone was obliged to take leave tho' I believe very reluctantly while in such suspence  Mrs Selwyn then by dint of interrogatories drew from me the state of this affair She is so penetrating that there is no possibility of evading to give her satisfaction  Is not this a strange event Good Heaven how little did I think that the visits I so unwillingly paid at Mr Branghton's would have introduced me to so near a relation I will never again regret the time I spent in town this summer a circumstance so fortunate will always make me think of it with pleasure  I have just received your letterand it has almost broken my heartOh Sir the illusion is over indeedHow vainly have I flattered how  miserably deceived myself Long since doubtful of the situation of my heart I dreaded a scrutinybut now now that I have so long escaped I began indeed to think my safety insured to hope that my fears were causeless and to believe that my good opinion and esteem of Lord Orville might be owned without suspicion and felt without dangermiserably deceived indeed  His sight is baneful to my reposehis society is death to my future tranquility  Oh Lord Orville could I have believed that a friendship so grateful to my heartso soothing to my distressesa friendship which in every respect did me so much honour would only serve to embitter all my future momentsWhat a strange what an unhappy circumstance that my gratitude though so justly excited should be so fatal to my peace  Yes Sir I  will  quit himwould to Heaven I could at this moment without seeing him againwithout trusting to my now conscious emotionOh Lord Orville how little do you know the evils I owe to you how little suppose that when most dignified by your attention I was most to be pitiedand when most exalted by your notice you were most my enemy  You Sir relied upon my ignoranceI alas upon your experience and whenever I doubted the weakness of my heart the idea that  you  did not suspect it reassured meresstored my courage and confirmed my errorYet am I most sensible of the kindness of your silence  Oh Sir why have I ever quitted youwhy been exposed to dangers to which I am so unequal  But I will leave this placeleave Lord Orvilleleave him perhaps for everno matter your counsel your goodness may teach me how to recover the peace and the serenity of which my unguarded folly has beguiled me To you alone do I trustin you alone confide for every future hope I may form  The more I consider of parting with Lord Orvile the less fortitude do I feel to bear the separationthe friendship he has shewn me his politenesshis sweetness of manners his concern in my affairshis solicitude to oblige meall all to be given up  No I cannot tell him I am goingI dare not trust myself to take leave of himI will run away without seeing himimplicitly will I follow your advice avoid his sight and shun his society  Tomorrow morning I will set off for Berry Hill Mrs Selwyn and Mrs Beaumont shall alone know my intention And todayI will spend in my own room The readiness of my obedience is the only atonement I can offer for the weakness which calls for its exertion  Can you will you most honoured most dear Sirsole prop by which the poor Evelina is supportedcan you without reproach without displeasure receive the child you have so carefully rearedfrom whose education better fruit might have been expected and who blushing for her unworthiness fears to meet the eye by which she has been cherishedOh yes I am sure you will Your Evelina's errors are those of the judgmentand you I well know pardon all but those of the heart  LETTER XXV  Evelina in continuation  Clifton  October st  I HAVE only time my dearest Sir for three words to overtake my last letter and prevent your expecting me immediately for when I communicated my intention to Mrs Selwyn she would not hear of it and declared it would be highly ridiculous for me to go before I received an answer to my intelligence concerning the journey from Paris She has therefore insisted upon my waiting till your next letter arrives I hope you will not be displeased at my compliance though it is rather against my own judgment but Mrs Selwyn quite overpowered me with the force of her arguments I will however see very little of Lord Orville I will never come down stairs before breakfast give up all my walks in the gardenseat myself next to Mrs Selwyn and not merely avoid his conversation but shun his presence I will exert all the prudence and all the resolution in my powerto prevent this short delay from giving you any further uneasiness  Adieu my dearest Sir I shall not now leave Clifton till I have your directions  LETTER XXVI  Evelina in continuation  October d  YESTERDAY from the time I received your kind though heartpiercing letter I kept my roomfor I was equally unable and unwilling to see Lord Orville but this morning finding I seemed destined to pass a few days longer here I endeavoured to calm my spirits and to appear as usual though I determined to avoid him as much as should be in my power Indeed as I entered the parlour when called to breakfast my thoughts were so much occupied with your letter that I felt as much confusion at his sight as if he had himself been informed of its contents  Mrs Beaumont made me a slight compliment upon my recovery for I had pleaded illness to excuse keeping my room Lady Louisa spoke not a word but Lord Orville little imagining himself the cause of my indisposition enquired concerning my health with the most distinguishing politeness I hardly made any answer and for the first time since I have been here contrived to sit at some distance from him  I could not help observing that my reserve surprised him yet he persisted in his civilities and seemed to wish to remove it But I paid him but very little attention and the moment breakfast was over instead of taking a book or walking in the garden I retired to my own room  Soon after Mrs Selwyn came to tell me that Lord Orville had been proposing I should take an airing and persuading her to let him drive us both in his phaeton She delivered the message with an archness that made me blush and added that an airing in  my Lord Orville's carriage  could not fail to revive my spirits There is no possibility of escaping her discernment she has frequently rallied me upon his Lordship's attentionand alasupon the pleasure with which I have received it However I absolutely refused the offer  "Well"  said she laughing  "I cannot just now indulge you with any solicitation for to tell you the truth I have business to transact at the Wells and am glad to be excused myself I would ask you to walk with  me  but since  Lord Orville  is refused  I  have not the presumption to hope for success"  "Indeed"  cried I  "you are mistaken I will attend  you  with pleasure"  "O rare coquetry"  cried she  "surely it must be inherent in our sex or it could not have been imbibed at Berry Hill"  I had not spirits to answer her and therefore put on my hat and cloak in silence  "I presume"  continued she drily  "his Lordship may walk with us"  "If so Madam"  said I  "you will have a companion and I will stay at home"  "My dear child"  cried she  "did you bring the certificate of your birth with you"  "Dear Madam no"  "Why then we shall never be known again at Berry Hill"  I felt too conscious to enjoy her pleasantry but I believe she was determined to torment me  for she asked if she should inform Lord Orville that I desired him not to be of the party  "By no means Madambut indeed I had rather not walk myself"  "My dear"  cried she  "I really do not know you this morningyou have certainly been taking a lesson of Lady Louisa"  She then went down stairs but presently returning told me she had acquainted Lord Orville that I did not choose to go out in the phaeton but preferred a walk  teteatete  with her by way of  variety  I said nothing but was really vexed She bid me go down stairs and said she would follow immediately  Lord Orville met me in the hall  "I fear"  said he  "Miss Anville is not yet quite well"  and he would have taken my hand but I turned from him and courtsying slightly went into the parlour  Mrs Beaumont and Lady Louisa were at work Lord Merton was talking with the latter for he has now made his peace and been again received into favour  I seated myself as usual by the window Lord Orville in a few minutes came to me and said  "Why is Miss Anville so grave"  "Not grave my Lord"  said I  "only stupid"  and I took up a book  "You will go"  said he after a short pause  "to the assembly tonight"  "No my Lord certainly not"  "Neither then will I for I should be sorry to sully the remembrance I have of the happiness I enjoyed at the last"  Mrs Selwyn then coming in general enquiries were made to all but me of who would go to  the assembly Lord Orville instantly declared he had letters to write at home but every one else  ettled to go  I then hastened Mrs Selwyn away tho' not before she had said to Lord Orville  "Pray has your Lordship obtained Miss Anville's leave to favour us with your company"  "I have not Madam"  answered he  "had the vanity to ask it"  During our walk Mrs Selwyn tormented me unmercifully She told me that since I declined any addition to our party I must doubtless be conscious of my own powers of entertainment and begged me therefore to exert them freely I repented a thousand times having consented to walk alone with her for though I made the most painful efforts to appear in spirits her raillery quite overpowered me  The first place we went to was the pumproom It was full of company and the moment we entered I heard a murmuring of  "  That's she  "  and to my great confusion I saw every eye turned towards me I pulled my hat over my face and by the assistance of Mrs Selwyn endeavoured to screen myself from observation nevertheless I found I was so much the object of general attention that I entreated her to hasten away But unfortunately she had entered into conversation very earnestly with a gentleman of her acquaintance and would not listen to me but said that if I was tired of waiting I might walk on to the milliner's with the Miss Watkins two young ladies I had seen at Mrs Beaumont's who were going thither  I accepted the offer very readily and away we went But we had not gone three yards ere we were followed by a party of young men who  took every possible opportunity of looking at us and as they walked behind talked aloud in a manner at once unintelligible and absurd  "Yes"  cried one  "'tis certainly she"  mark but her  blushing cheek  "And then her  eye  her  downcast eye  "  cried another  "True oh most true"  said a third  every beauty is her own  "  "But then"  said the first  "her  mind  now the difficulty is to find out the truth of  that  for she will not say a word"  "She is  timid  "  answered another  "mark but her  timid air  "  During this conversation we all walked on silent and quick as we knew not to whom it was particularly addressed we were all equally ashamed and equally desirous to avoid such unaccountable observations  Soon after we were caught in a violent shower of rain We hurried on and the care of our cloaths occupying our hands we were separated from one another These gentlemen offered their services in the most pressing manner begging us to make use of their arms and two of them were so particularly troublesome to me that in my haste to avoid them I unfortunately stumbled and fell down They both assisted in helping me up and that very instant while I was yet between them upon raising my eyes the first object they met was Sir Clement Willoughby  He started so I am sure did I  "Good God"  exclaimed he with his usual quickness  "Miss AnvilleI hope to Heaven you are not hurt"  "No"  cried I  "not at all but I am terribly dirtied"  I then without much difficulty disengaged myself from my tormentors who immediately gave way to Sir Clement and entirely quitted us  He teized me to make use of his arm and when I declined it asked very significantly if I was much acquainted with those gentlemen who had just left me  "No"  answered I  "they are quite unknown to me"  "And yet"  said he  "you allowed  them  the honour of assisting you Oh Miss Anville to me alone will you ever be thus cruel"  "Indeed Sir Clement their assistance was  forced  upon me for I would have given the world to have avoided them"  "Good God"  cried he  "why did I not sooner know your situationBut I only arrived here this morning and I had not even learnt where you lodged"  "Did you know then that I was at Bristol"  "Would to Heaven"  cried he  "that I  could  remain in ignorance of your proceedings with the same contentment you do of mine then should I not for ever journey upon the wings of hope to meet my own despair  You  cannot even judge of the cruelty of my fate for the ease and serenity of your mind incapacitates you from feeling for the agitation of mine"  The ease and serenity of  my  mind alas how little do I merit those words  "But"  added he  "had  accident  brought me hither had I not known of your journey the voice of fame would have proclaimed it to me instantly upon my arrival"  "The voice of fame"  repeated I  "Yes for your's was the first name I heard at the pumproom But had I  not  heard your name such a description could have painted no one else"  "Indeed"  said I  "I do not understand you"  But just then arriving at the milliner's our conversation ended for I ran up stairs to wipe the dirt off my gown I should have been glad to have remained there till Mrs Selwyn came but the Miss Watkins called me into the shop to look at caps and ribbons  I found Sir Clement busily engaged in looking at lace ruffles Instantly however approaching me  "How charmed I am"  said he  "to see you look so well I was told you were illbut I never saw you in better healthnever more infinitely lovely"  I turned away to examine the ribbons and soon after Mrs Selwyn made her appearance I found that she was acquainted with Sir Clement and her manner of speaking to him convinced me that he was a favourite with her  When their mutual compliments were over she turned to me and said  "Pray Miss Anville how long can you live without nourishment"  "Indeed Ma'am"  said I laughing  "I have never tried"  "Because so long and no longer"  answered she  "you may remain at Bristol"  "Why what is the matter Ma'am"  "The matterwhy all the ladies are at open war with youthe whole pumproom is in confusion and you innocent as you pretend to look are the cause However if you take my advice you will be very careful how you eat and drink during your stay"  I begged her to explain herself and she then told me that a copy of verses had been dropt in the pumproom and read there aloud  "The beauties of the well"  said she  "are all mentioned but  you  are the Venus to whom the prize is given"  "Is it then possible"  cried Sir Clement  "that you have not seen these verses"  "I hardly know"  answered I  "whether  any  body has"  "I assure you"  said Mrs Selwyn  "if you give  me  the invention of them you do me an honour I by no means deserve"  "I wrote down in my tablets"  said Sir Clement  "the stanzas which concern Miss Anville this morning at the pumproom and I will do myself the honour of copying them for her this evening"  "But why the part that concerned  Miss Anville  "  said Mrs Selwyn  "Did you ever see her before this morning"  "Oh yes"  answered he  "I have had that happiness frequently at Captain Mirvan's Too too frequently"  added he in a low voice as Mrs Selwyn turned to the milliner and as soon as she was occupied in examining some trimmings he came to me and almost whether I would or not entered into conversation with me  "I have a thousand things"  cried he  "to say to you Pray where are you"  "With Mrs Selwyn Sir"  "Indeedthen for once Chance is my friend And how long have you been here"  "About three weeks"  "Good Heaven what an anxious search have I had to discover your abode since you so suddenly  left town The termagant Madame Duval refused me all intelligence Oh Miss Anville did you know what I have endured the sleepless restless state of suspence I have been tortured with you could not all cruel as you are you could not have received me with such frigid indifference"  "  Received  you Sir"  "Why is not my visit to  you  Do you think I should have made this journey but for the happiness of again seeing you"  "Indeed it is possible I mightsince so many others do"  "Cruel cruel girl you  know  that I adore youyou  know  you are the mistress of my soul and arbitress of my fate"  Mrs Selwyn then advancing to us he assumed a more disengaged air and asked if he should not have the pleasure of seeing her in the evening at the assembly  "Oh yes"  cried she  "we shall certainly be there so you may bring the verses with you if Miss Anville can wait for them so long"  "I hope then"  returned he  "that you will do me the honour to dance with me"  I thanked him but said I should not be at the assembly  "Not be at the assembly"  cried Mrs Selwyn  "Why have  you  too letters to write"  She looked at me with a significant archness that made me colour and I hastily answered  "No indeed Ma'am"  "You have not"  cried she yet more drily  "then pray my dear do you stay at home to  help  or to  hinder  others"  "To do neither Ma'am"  answered I in much confusion  "so if you please I will  not  stay at home"  "You allow me then"  said Sir Clement  "to hope for the honour of your hand"  I only bowedfor the dread of Mrs Selwyn's raillery made me not dare to refuse him  Soon after this we walked home Sir Clement accompanied us and the conversation that passed between Mrs Selwyn and him was supported in so lively a manner that I should have been much entertained had my mind been more at ease but alas I could think of nothing but the capricious the unmeaning appearance which the alteration in my conduct must make in the eyes of Lord Orville And much as I wish to avoid him greatly as I desire to save myself from having my weakness known to himyet I cannot endure to incur his ill opinionand unacquainted as he is with the reasons by which I am actuated how can he fail contemning a change to him so unaccountable  As we entered the garden he was the first object we saw He advanced to meet us and I could not help observing that at sight of each other both he and Sir Clement changed colour  We went into the parlour where we found the same party we had left Mrs Selwyn presented Sir Clement to Mrs Beaumont Lady Louisa and Lord Merton he seemed well acquainted with already  The conversation was upon the general subjects of the weather the company at the Wells and the news of the day But Sir Clement drawing his chair next to mine took every opportunity of addressing himself to me in particular  I could not but remark the striking difference of  his  attention and that of Lord Orville the latter has such gentleness of manners such delicacy of conduct and an air so respectful that when he flatters most he never distresses and when he most confers honour appears to receive it The former  obtrudes  his attention and  forces  mine it is so pointed that it always confuses me and so public that it attracts general notice Indeed I have sometimes thought that he would rather  wish  than dislike to have his partiality for me known as he takes great care to prevent my being spoken to by any body but himself  When at length he went away Lord Orville took his seat and said with a halfsmile  "Shall  I  call Sir Clementor will  you  call me an usurper for taking this placeYou make me no answerMust I then suppose that Sir Clement"  "It is little worth your Lordship's while"  said I  "to suppose any thing upon so insignificant an occasion"  "Pardon me"  cried he  "to  me  nothing is insignificant in which you are concerned"  To this I made no answer neither did he say any thing more till the ladies retired to dress and then when I would have followed them he stopped me saying  "One moment I entreat you"  I turned back and he went on  "I greatly fear that I have been so unfortunate as to offend you yet so repugnant to my very soul is the idea that I know not how to suppose it possible I can unwittingly have done the thing in the world that designedly I would most wish to avoid"  "No indeed my Lord you have not"  said I  "You sigh"  cried he taking my hand  "would to Heaven I were the sharer of your uneasiness whencesoever it springs with what earnestness would I not struggle to alleviate itTell me my dear Miss Anvillemy newadopted sister my sweet and most amiable friendtell me I beseech you if I can afford you any assistance"  "None none my Lord"  cried I withdrawing my hand and moving towards the door  "Is it then impossible I can serve youperhaps you wish to see Mr Macartney again"  "No my Lord"  And I held the door open  "I am not I own sorry for that Yet oh Miss Anville there  is  a questionthere is a conjectureI know not how to mention because I dread the resultBut I see you are in hasteperhaps in the evening I may have the honour of a longer conversationYet one thing will you have the goodness to allow me to askDid you this morning when you went to the Wellsdid you  know  who you should meet there"  "Who my Lord"  "I beg your pardon a thonsand times for a curiosity so unlicensedbut I will say no more at present"  He bowed expecting me to goand then with quick steps but a heavy heart I came to my own room His question I am sure meant Sir Clement Willoughby and had I not imposed upon upon myself the severe task of avoiding flying Lord Orville with all my power I would instantly have satisfied him of my ignorance of Sir Clement's journey And yet more did I long to say something of the assembly since I found he depended upon my spending the evening at home  I did not go down stairs again till the family was assembled to dinner My dress I saw struck Lord Orville with astonishment and I was myself  so much ashamed of appearing whimsical and unsteady that I could not look up  "I understood"  said Mrs Beaumont  "that Miss Anville did not go out this evening"  "Her intention in the morning"  said Mrs Selwyn  was to stay at home but there is a fascinating power in an  assembly  which upon second thoughts is not to be resisted"  "The assembly"  cried Lord Orville  "are you then going to the assembly"  I made no answer and we all took our places at table  It was not without difficulty that I contrived to give up my usual seat but I was determined to adhere to the promise in my yesterday's letter though I saw that Lord Orville seemed quite confounded at my visible endeavours to avoid him  After dinner we all went into the drawingroom together as there were no gentlemen to detain his Lordship and then before I could place myself out of his way he said  "You are then really going to the assemblyMay I ask if you shall dance"  "I believe notmy Lord"  "If I did not fear"  continued he  "that you would be tired of the same partner at two following assemblies I would give up my letterwriting till tomorrow and solicit the honour of your hand"  "If I  do  dance"  said I in great confusion  "I believe I am engaged"  "Engaged"  cried he with earnestness  "May I ask to whom"  "ToSir Clement Willoughby my Lord"  He said nothing but looked very little pleased and did not address himself to me any more all the  afternoon Oh Sirthus situated how comfortless were the feelings of your Evelina  Early in the evening with his accustomed assiduity Sir Clement came to conduct us to the assembly He soon contrived to seat himself next me and in a low voice paid me so many compliments that I knew not which way to look  Lord Orville hardly spoke a word and his countenance was grave and thoughtful yet whenever I raised my eyes his I perceived were directed towards me though instantly upon meeting mine he looked another way  In a short time Sir Clement taking from his pocket a folded paper said almost in a whisper  "Here loveliest of women you will see a faint a successless attempt to paint the object of all my adoration yet weak as are the lines for the purpose I envy beyond expression the happy mortal who has dared make the effort"  "I will look at them"  said I  "some other time"  For conscious that I was observed by Lord Orville I could not bear he should see me take a written paper so privately offered from Sir Clement But Sir Clement is an impracticable man and I never yet succeeded in any attempt to frustrate whatever he had planned  "No"  said he still in a whisper  "you must take it now while Lady Louisa is away"  for she and Mrs Selwyn were gone up stairs to finish their dress  "as she must by no means see them"  "Indeed"  said I  "I have no intention to shew them"  "But the only way"  answered he  "to avoid suspicion is to take them in her absence I would have read them aloud myself but that they are not proper to be seen by any body in this house yourself and Mrs Selwyn excepted"  Then again he presented me the paper which I now was obliged to take as I found declining it was vain But I was sorry that this action should be seen and the whispering remarked though the purport of the conversation was left to conjecture  As I held it in my hand Sir Clement teazed me to look at it immediately and told me that the reason he could not produce the lines publicly was that among the ladies who were mentioned and supposed to be rejected was Lady Louisa Larpent I am much concerned at this circumstance as I cannot doubt but that it will render me more disagreeable to her than ever if she should hear of it  I will now copy the verses which Sir Clement would not let me rest till I had read  SEE last advance with bashful grace  Downcast eye and blushing cheek  Timid air and beauteous face  Anvillewhom the Graces seek  Though ev'ry beauty is her own  And though her mind each virtue fills  Anvilleto her power unknown  Artless strikesunconscious kills  I am sure my dear Sir you will not wonder that a panegyric such as this should in  reading give me the greatest confusion and unfortunately before I had finished it the ladies returned  "What have you there my dear"  said Mrs Selwyn  "Nothing Ma'am"  said I hastily solding and putting it in my pocket  "And has  nothing  "  cried she  "the power of  rouge  "  I made no answer a deep sigh which escaped Lord Orville at that moment reached my ears and gave me sensationswhich I dare not mention  Lord Merton then handed Lady Louisa and Mrs Beaumont to the latter's carriage Mrs Selwyn led the way to Sir Clement's who handed me in after her  During the ride I did not once speak but when I came to the assemblyroom Sir Clement took care that I should not preserve my silence He asked me immediately to dance I begged him to excuse me and seek some other partner But on the contrary he told me he was very glad I would sit still as he had a million of things to say to me  He then began to tell me how much he had suffered from absence how greatly he was alarmed when he heard I had left town and how cruelly difficult he had found it to trace me which at last he could only do by sacrificing another week to Captain Mirvan  "And Howard Grove"  still continued he  "which at my first visit I thought the most delightful spot upon earth now appeared to be the most dismal the face of the country seemed altered the walks which I had thought most pleasant were now most stupid Lady Howard  who had appeared a chearful and respectable old lady now seemed in the common John Trot style of other aged dames Mrs Mirvan whom I had esteemed as an amiable piece of stilllife now became so insipid that I could hardly keep awake in her company the daughter too whom I had regarded as a goodhumoured pretty sort of girl now seemed too insignificant for notice and as to the Captain I had always thought him a boobybut now he appeared a savage"  "Indeed Sir Clement"  cried I angrily  "I will not hear you talk thus of my best friends"  "I beg your pardon"  said he  "but the contrast of my two visits was too striking not to be mentioned"  He then asked me what I thought of the verses  "Either"  said I  "that they are written ironically or by some madman"  Such a profusion of compliments ensued that I was obliged to propose dancing in my own defence When we stood up  "I intended"  said he  "to have discovered the author by his looks but I find you so much the general loadstone of attention that my suspicions change their object every moment Surely you must yourself have some knowledge who he is"  I told him No But my dear Sir I must own to you I have no doubt but that Mr Macartney must be the author no one else would speak of me so partially and indeed his poetical turn puts it with me beyond dispute  He asked me a thousand questions concerning Lord Orville how long he had been at Bristol  what time I had spent at Cliftonwhether he rode out every morningwhether I ever trusted myself in a phaetonand a multitude of other enquiries all made with his usual freedom and impetuosity  Fortunately as I much wished to retire early Lady Louisa makes a point of being among the first who quit the rooms and therefore we got home in very tolerable time  Lord Orville's reception of us was grave and cold far from distinguishing me as usual by particular civilities Lady Louisa herself could not have seen me enter the room with more frigid unconcern nor have more scrupulously avoided honouring me with any notice But chiefly I was struck to see that he suffered Sir Clement who stayed supper to sit between us without any effort to prevent him though till then he had seemed to be even tenacious of a seat next mine  This little circumstance affected me more than I can express yet I endeavoured to  rejoice  at it since neglect and indifference from him may be my best friendsBut alasso suddenly so abruptly to forfeit his attentionto lose his friendshipOh Sir these thoughts pierced my soulscarce could I keep my seat for not all my efforts could restrain the tears from trickling down my cheeks however as Lord Orville saw them not for Sir Clement's head was constantly between us I tried to collect my spirits and succeeded so far as to keep my seat with decency till Sir Clement took leave and then not daring to trust my eyes to meet those of Lord Orville I retired  I have been writing ever since for certain that I could not sleep I would not go to bed  Tell me my dearest Sir if you possibly can tell me that you approve my change of conducttell me that my altered behaviour to Lord Orville is rightthat my flying his society and avoiding his civilities are actions which  you  would have dictatedTell me this and the sacrifices I have made will comfort me in the midst of my regretfor never never can I cease to regret that I have lost the friendship of Lord OrvilleOh Sir I have slightedhave rejectedhave thrown it awayNo matter it was an honour I merited not to preserve and I now seethat my mind was unequal to sustaining it without danger  Yet so strong is the desire you have implanted in me to act with uprightness and propriety that however the weakness of my heart may distress and afflict me it will never I humbly trust render me wilfully culpable The wish of doing well governs every other as far as concerns my conductfor am I not  your  childthe creature of your own formingYet oh Sir friend parent of my heartmy feelings are all at war with my duties and while I most struggle to acquire selfapprobation my peace my hopes my happinessare lost  'Tis you alone can compose a mind so cruelly agitated you I well know can feel pity for the weakness to which you are a stranger and though you blame the affliction soothe and comfort the afflicted  LETTER XXVII  Mr Villars to Evelina  Berry Hill  Oct  YOUR last communication my dearest child is indeed astonishing that an acknowledged daughter and heiress of Sir John Belmont should be at Bristol and still my Evelina bear the name of Anville is to me inexplicable yet the mystery of the letter to Lady Howard prepared me to expect something extraordinary upon Sir John Belmont's return to England  Whoever this young lady may be it is certain she now takes a place to which you have a right indisputable An  aftermarriage  I never heard of yet supposing such a one to have happened Miss Evelyn was certainly the first wife and therefore her daughter must at least be entitled to the name of Belmont  Either there are circumstances in this affair at present utterly incomprehensible or else some strange and most atrocious fraud has been practised which of these two is the case it now behoves us to enquire  My reluctance to this step gives way to my conviction of its propriety since the reputation of your dear and muchinjured mother must now either be fully cleared from blemish or receive its final and indelible wound  The public appearance of a daughter of Sir John Belmont will revive the remembrance of Miss Evelyn's story to all who have heard itwho the  mother  was will be universally demanded  and if any other Lady Belmont shall be namedthe birth of my Evelina will receive a stigma against which honour truth and innocence may appeal in vain a stigma which will eternally blast the fair fame of her virtuous mother and cast upon her blameless self the odium of a title which not all her purity can rescue from established shame and dishonour  No my dear child no I will not quietly suffer the ashes of your mother to be treated with ignominy Her spotless character shall be justified to the worldher marriage shall be acknowledged and her child shall bear the name to which she is lawfully entitled  It is true that Mrs Mirvan would conduct this affair with more delicacy than Mrs Selwynyet perhaps to save time is of all considerations the most important since the longer this mystery is suffered to continue the more difficult my be rendered its explanation The sooner therefore my dear you can set out for town the less formidable will be your task  Let not your timidity my dear love depress your spirits I shall indeed tremble for you at a meeting so singular and so affecting yet there can be no doubt of the success of your applicationI enclose a letter from your unhappy mother written and reserved purposely for this occasion Mrs Clinton too who attended her in her last illness must accompany you to townBut without any other certificate of your birth that which you carry in your countenance as it could not be effected by artifice so it cannot admit of the smallest doubt  And now my Evelina committed at length to the care of your real parent receive the fervent prayers wishes and blessings of him who so fondly adopted you  May'st thou oh child of my bosom may'st thou in this change of situation experience no change of disposition but receive with humility and support with meekness the elevation to which thou art rising May thy manners language and deportment all evince that modest equanimity and chearful gratitude which not merely deserve but dignify prosperity May'st thou to the last moments of an unblemished life retain thy genuine simplicity thy singleness of heart thy guileless sincerity and may'st thou stranger to ostentation and superior to insolence with true greatness of soul shine forth conspicuous only in beneficence  ARTHUR VILLARS  LETTER XXVIII  Inclosed in the preceding Letter  Lady Belmont to Sir John Belmont  IN the firm hope that the moment of anguish which approaches will prove the period of my sufferrings once more I address myself to Sir John Belmont in behalf of the child who if it survives its mother will hereafter be the bearer of this letter  Yet in what termsoh most cruel of mencan the lost Caroline address you and not address you in vain Oh deaf to the voice of compassiondeaf to the sting of truthdeaf to every tie of honoursay in what terms may the lost Caroline address you and not address you in vain  Shall I call you by the loved the respected title of husbandNo you disclaim itthe father of my infantNo you doom it to infamythe lover who rescued me from a forced marriageNo you have yourself betrayed methe friend from whom I hoped succour and protectionNo you have consigned me to misery and destruction  Oh hardened against every plea of justice remorse or pity how and in what manner may I hope to move thee Is there one method I have left untried remains there one resource unessayed No I have exhausted all the bitterness of reproach and drained every sluice of compassion  Hopeless and almost desperate twenty times have I flung away my penbut the feelings of a mother a mother agonizing for the fate of her child again animating my courage as often I have resumed it  Perhaps when I am no more when the measure of my woes is compleated and the still silent unreproaching dust has received my sad remainsthen perhaps when accusation is no longer to be feared nor detection to be dreaded the voice of equity and the cry of nature may be heard  Listen oh Belmont to their dictates reprobate not your child though you have reprobated its mother The evils that are past perhaps  when too late you may wish to recall the young creature you have persecuted perhaps when too late you may regret that you have destroyedyou may think with horror of the deceptions you have practised and the pangs of remorse may follow me to the tomboh Belmont all my resentment softens into pity at the thought what will become of thee good Heaven when with the eye of penitence thou reviewest thy past conduct  Hear then the solemn the last address with which the unhappy Caroline will importune thee  If when the time of thy contrition arrivesfor arrive it mustwhen the sense of thy treachery shall rob thee of almost every other if then thy tortured heart shall sigh to expiate thy guiltmark the conditions upon which I leave thee my forgiveness  Thou know'st I am thy wifeclear then to the world the reputation thou hast sullied and receive as thy lawful successor the child who will present thee this my dying request  The worthiest the most benevolent the best of men to whose consoling kindness I owe the little tranquility I have been able to preserve has plighted me his faith that upon no other conditions he will part with his helpless charge  Should'st thou in the features of this deserted innocent trace the resemblance of the wretched Carolineshould its face bear the marks of its birth and revive in thy memory the image of its mother wilt thou not Belmont wilt thou not therefore renounce itOh babe of my fondest affection for whom already I experience all the tenderness of maternal pitylook not like thy unfortunate motherleft the parent whom the  hand of death may spare shall be snatched from thee by the more cruel means of unnatural antipathy  I can write no more The small share of serenity I have painfully acquired will not bear the shock of the dreadful ideas that crowd upon me  Adieufor ever  Yet ohshall I not in this last farewell which thou wilt not read till every stormy passion is extinctand the kind grave has embosomed all my sorrowsshall I not offer to the man once so dear to me a ray of consolation to those afflictions he has in reserve Suffer me then to tell thee that my pity far exceeds my indignationthat I will pray for thee in my last momentsand that the recollection of the love I once bore thee shall swallow up every other  Once more adieu  CAROLINE BELMONT  LETTER XXIX  Evelina to the Rev Mr Villars  Clifton  Oct d  THIS morning I saw from my window that Lord Orville was walking in the garden but I would not go down stairs till breakfast was ready and then he paid me his compliments almost as coldly as Lady Louisa paid her's  I took my usual place and Mrs Beaumont Lady Louisa and Mrs Selwyn entered into their usual conversationNot so your Evelina disregarded silent and melancholy she sat like a cypher whom to nobody belonging by nobody was noticed  Ill brooking such a situation and unable to support the neglect of Lord Orville the moment breakfast was over I left the room and was going up stairs when very unpleasantly I was stopped by Sir Clement Willoughby who flying into the hall prevented my proceeding  He enquired very particularly after my health and entreated me to return into the parlour Unwillingly I consented but thought any thing preferable to continuing alone with him and he would neither leave me nor suffer me to pass on Yet in returning I felt not a little ashamed of appearing thus to take the visit of Sir Clement to myself And indeed he took pains by his manner of addressing me to give it that air  He stayed I believe two hours nor would he perhaps even then have gone had not Mrs Beaumont broken up the party by proposing an airing in her coach Lady Louisa consented to accompany her but Mrs Selwyn when applied to said  "If my Lord or Sir Clement will join us I shall be happy to make onebut really a trio of females will be nervous to the last degree"  Sir Clement readily agreed to attend them indeed he makes it his evident study to court the favour of Mrs Beaumont Lord Orville excused himself from going out and I retired to my own room What he did with himself I know not for I would not go down stairs till dinner  was ready his coldness though my own change of behaviour has occasioned it so cruelly depresses my spirits that I know not how to support myself in his presence  At dinner I found Sir Clement again of the party Indeed he manages every thing his own way for Mrs Beaumont though by no means easy to please seems quite at his disposal  The dinner the afternoon and the evening were to me the most irksome imaginable I was tormented by the assiduity of Sir Clement who not only  took  but  made  opportunities of speaking to meand I was hurtoh how inexpressibly hurtthat Lord Orville not only forbore as hitherto  seeking  he even  neglected  all occasions of talking with me  I begin to think my dear Sir that the sudden alteration in my behaviour was ill judged and improper for as I had received no offence as the cause of the change was upon  my  account not  his  I should not have assumed so abruptly a reserve for which I dared assign no reasonnor have shunned his presence so obviously without considering the strange appearance of such a conduct  Alas my dearest Sir that my reflections should always be too late to serve me dearly indeed do I purchase experience and much I fear I shall suffer yet more severely from the heedless indiscretion of my temper ere I attain that prudence and consideration which by foreseeing distant consequences may rule and direct in present exigencies  Oct th  Yesterday morning every body rode out except Mrs Selwyn and myself and we two sat for some time together in her room but as soon as I  could I quitted her to saunter in the garden for she diverts herself so unmercifully with rallying me either upon my gravityor concerning Lord Orvillethat I dread having any conversation with her  Here I believe I spent an hour by myself when hearing the gardengate open I went into an arbour at the end of a long walk where ruminating very unpleasantly upon my future prospects I remained quietly seated but a few minutes ere I was interrupted by the appearance of Sir Clement Willoughby  I started and would have left the arbour but he prevented me Indeed I am almost certain he had heard in the house where I was as it is not otherwise probable he would have strolled down the garden alone  "Stop stop"  cried he  "loveliest and most beloved of women stop and hear me"  Then making me keep my place he sat down by me and would have taken my hand but I drew it back and said I could not stay  "Can you then"  cried he  "refuse me even the smallest gratification though but yesterday I almost suffered martyrdom for the pleasure of seeing you"  "Martyrdom Sir Clement"  "Yes beauteous Insensible  martyrdom  for did I not compel myself to be immured in a carriage the tedious length of a whole morning with the three most fatiguing women in England"  "Upon my word the Ladies are extremely obliged to you"  "O"  returned he  they have every one of them so copious a share of their own personal esteem that they have no right to repine at the  failure of it in the world and indeed they will themselves be the last to discover it"  "How little"  cried I  "are those Ladies aware of such severity from  you  "  "They are guarded"  answered he  "so happily and so securely by their own conceit that they are not aware of it from any body Oh Miss Anville to be torn away from  you  in order to be shut up with  them  is there a human being except your cruel self could forbear to pity me"  "I believe Sir Clement however hardly you may choose to judge of them your situation by the world in general would rather have been envied than pitied"  "The world in general"  answered he  "has the same opinion of them that I have myself Mrs Beaumont is every where laughed at Lady Louisa ridiculed and Mrs Selwyn hated"  "Good God Sir Clement what cruel strength of words do you use"  "It is you my angel are to blame since your perfections have rendered their faults so glaring I protest to you during our whole ride I thought the carriage drawn by snails The absurd pride of Mrs Beaumont and the respect she exacts are at once insufferable and stupifying had I never before been in her company I should have concluded that this had been her first airing from the herald'sofficeand wished her nothing worse than that it might also be the last I assure you that but for gaining the freedom of her house I would fly her as I would plague pestilence and famine Mrs Selwyn indeed afforded some relief from this formality but the unbounded licence of her tongue"  "O Sir Clement do  you  object to that"  "Yes my sweet reproacher in a  woman  I do in a  woman  I think it intolerable She has wit I acknowledge and more understanding than half her sex put together but she keeps alive a perpetual expectation of satire that spreads a general uneasiness among all who are in her presence and she talks so much that even the best things she says weary the attention As to the little Louisa 'tis such a pretty piece of languor that 'tis almost cruel to speak rationally about herelse I should say she is a mere compound of affectation impertinence and airs"  "I am quite amazed"  said I  "that with such opinions you can behave to them all with so much attention and civility"  "Civility my angelwhy I could worship could adore them only to procure myself a moment of your conversation Have you not seen me pay my court to the gross Captain Mirvan and the virago Madame Duval Were it possible that a creature so horrid could be formed as to partake of the worst qualities of all these charactersa creature who should have the haughtiness of Mrs Beaumont the brutality of Captain Mirvan the selfconceit of Mrs Selwyn the affectation of Lady Louisa and the vulgarity of Madame Duvaleven to such a monster as that I would pay homage and pour forth adulation only to obtain one word one look from my adored Miss Anville"  "Sir Clement"  said I  "you are greatly mistaken if you suppose such duplicity of character recommends you to my good opinion But I must take this opportunity of begging you never more to talk to me in this strain"  "Oh Miss Anville your reproofs your coldness pierce me to the soul look upon me with less rigour and make me what you pleaseyou shall govern and direct all my actionsyou shall newform newmodel meI will not have even a wish but of your suggestiononly deign to look upon me with pityif not with favour"  "Suffer me Sir"  said I very gravely  "to make use of this occasion to put a final conclusion to such expressions I entreat you never again to address me in a language so flighty and so unwelcome You have already given me great uneasiness and I must frankly assure you that if you do not desire to banish me from wherever you are you will adopt a very different style and conduct in future"  I then rose and was going but he flung himself at my feet to prevent me exclaiming in a most passionate manner  "Good God Miss Anville what do you sayis it can it be possible that so unmoved that with such petrifying indifference you can tear from me even the remotest hope"  "I know not Sir said I"  endeavouring to disengage myself from him  "what hope you mean but I am sure I never intended to give you any"  "You distract me"  cried he  "I cannot endure such scornI beseech you to have some moderation in your cruelty lest you make me desperatesay then that you pity meO fairest inexorable loveliest tyrantsay tell me at least that you pity me  Just then who should come in sight as if intending to pass by the arbour but Lord Orville Good Heaven how did I start and he the moment  he saw me turned pale and was hastily retiringbut I called out  "Lord OrvilleSir Clement release melet go my hand"  Sir Clement in some confusion suddenly rose but still grasped my hand Lord Orville who had turned back was again walking away but still struggling to disengage myself I called out  "Pray pray my Lord don't goSir Clement I  insist  upon your releasing me"  Lord Orville then hastily approaching us said with great spirit  "Sir Clement you cannot wish to detain Miss Anville by force"  "Neither my Lord"  cried Sir Clement proudly  "do I request the honour of your Lordship's interference"  However he let go my hand and I immediately ran into the house  I was now frightened to death lest Sir Clement's mortified pride should provoke him to affront Lord Orville I therefore ran hastily to Mrs Selwyn and entreated her in a manner hardly to be understood to walk towards the arbour She asked no questions for she is quick as lightening in taking a hint but instantly hastened into the garden  Imagine my dear Sir how wretched I must be till I saw her return scarce could I restrain myself from running back however I checked my impatience and waited though in agonies till she came  And now my dear Sir I have a conversation to write the most interesting to me that I ever heard The comments and questions with which Mrs Selwyn interrupted her account I shall not mention for they are such as you may very easily suppose  Lord Orville and Sir Clement were both seated very quietly in the arbour and Mrs Selwyn standing still as soon as she was within a few yards of them heard Sir Clement say  "Your question my Lord alarms me and I can by no means answer it unless you will allow me to propose another"  "Undoubtedly Sir"  "You ask me my Lord what are my intentionsI should be very happy to be satisfied as to your Lordship's"  "I have never Sir professed  any  "  Here they were both for a few moments silent and then Sir Clement said  "To what my Lord must I then impute your desire of knowing mine"  "To an unaffected interest in Miss Anville's welfare"  "Such an interest"  said Sir Clement drily  "is indeed very generous but except in a fathera brotheror a lover"  "Sir Clement  interrupted his Lordship  "I know your inferrence and I acknowledge I have not the right of enquiry which any of those three titles bestow and yet I confess the warmest wishes to serve her and to see her happy Will you then excuse me if I take the liberty to repeat my question"  "Yes if your Lordship will excuse my repeating that I think it a rather extraordinary one"  "It may be so"  said Lord Orville  "but this young lady seems to be peculiarly situated she is very young very inexperienced yet appears to be left totally to her own direction She does not I believe see the dangers to which she  is exposed and I will own to you I feel a strong desire to point them out"  "I don't rightly understand your Lordshipbut I think you cannot mean to prejudice her against me"  "Her sentiments of  you  Sir are as much unknown to me as your intentions towards  her  Perhaps were I acquainted with either my officiousness would be at an end but I presume not to ask upon what terms"  Here he stopped and Sir Clement said  "You know my Lord I am not given to despair I am by no means such a puppy as to tell you I am upon  sure ground  however perseverance"  "You are then Sir determined to persevere"  "I am my Lord"  "Pardon me then Sir Clement if I speak to you with freedom This young lady though she seems alone and in some measure unprotected is not entirely without friends she has been extremely well educated and accustomed to good company she has a natural love of virtue and a mind that might adorn  any  station however exalted is such a young lady Sir Clement a proper object to trifle withfor your principles excuse me Sir are well known"  "As to that my Lord let Miss Anville look to herself she has an excellent understanding and needs no counsellor"  "Her understanding is indeed excellentbut she is too young for suspicion and has an artlessness of disposition that I never saw equalled"  "My Lord"  cried Sir Clement warmly  "your praises make me doubt your disinterestedness and there exists not the man who I would  so unwillingly have for a rival as yourself But you must give me leave to say you have greatly deceived me in regard to this affair"  "How so Sir"  cried Lord Orville with equal warmth  "You were pleased my Lord"  answered Sir Clement  "upon our first conversation concerning this young lady to speak of her in terms by no means suited to your present encomiums you said she was a  poor weak ignorant girl  and I had great reason to believe you had a most contemptuous opinion of her"  "It is very true"  said Lord Orville  "that "I did not at our first acquaintance do justice to the merit of Miss Anville but I knew not then how new she was to the world at present however I am convinced that whatever might appear strange in her behaviour was simply the effect of inexperience timidity and a retired education for I find her informed sensible and intelligent She is not indeed like most modern young ladies to be known in half an hour her modest worth and fearful excellence require both time and encouragement to shew themselves She does not beautiful as she is seize the soul by surprize but with more dangerous fascination she steals it almost imperceptibly"  "Enough my Lord"  cried Sir Clement  "your solicitude for her welfare is now sufficiently explained"  "My friendship and esteem"  returned Lord Orville  "I do not wish to disguise but assure yourself Sir Clement I should not have troubled  you  upon this subject had Miss Anville and I ever conversed but as friends However since you do not chuse to avow your intentions we must drop the subject"  "My intentions"  cried he  "I will frankly own are hardly known to myself I think Miss Anville the loveliest of her sex and were I a  marrying man  she of all the women I have seen I would fix upon for a wife but I believe that not even the philosophy of your Lordship would recommend to me a connection of that sort with a girl of obscure birth whose only dowry is her beauty and who is evidently in a state of dependency"  "Sir Clement"  cried Lord Orville with some heat  "we will discuss this point no further we are both free agents and must act for ourselves"  Here Mrs Selwyn fearing a surprise and finding my apprehensions of danger were groundless retired hastily into another walk and soon after came to give me this account  Good Heaven what a man is this Sir Clement so designing though so easy so deliberately artful though so flighty Greatly however is he mistaken all confident as he seems for the girl obscure poor dependent as she is far from wishing the honour of his alliance would not only  now  but  always  have rejected it  As to Lord Orvillebut I will not trust my pen to mention himtell me my dear Sir what  you  think of himtell me if he is not the noblest of menand if you can either wonder at or blame my admiration  The idea of being seen by either party immediately after so singular a conversation was both awkward and distressing to me but I was obliged to appear at dinner Sir Clement I saw was absent and uneasy he watched me he watched Lord Orville and was evidently disturbed in his mind Whenever he spoke to me I turned  from him with undisguised disdain for I am too much irritated against him to bear with his illmeant assiduities any longer  But not oncenot a moment did I dare meet the eyes of Lord Orville All consciousness myself I dreaded his penetration and directed mine every waybut towards his The rest of the day I never quitted Mrs Selwyn  Adieu my dear Sir tomorrow I expect your directions whether I am to return to Berry Hill or once more visit London  LETTER XXX  Evelina in continuation  Clifton  October th  AND now my dearest Sir if the perturbation of my spirits will allow me I will finish my last letter from Clifton Hill  This morning though I did not go down stairs early I was the only person in the parlour when Lord Orville entered it I felt no small confusion at seeing him alone after having so long and successfully avoided such a meeting As soon as the usual compliments were over I would have left the room but he stopped me by saying  "If I disturb you Miss Anville I am gone"  "My Lord"  said I rather embarrassed  "I was just going"  "I flattered myself"  cried he  "I should have had a moment's conversation with you"  I then turned back and he seemed himself in some perplexity but after a short pause  "You are very good"  said he  "to indulge my request I have indeed for some time past most ardently desired an opportunity of speaking to you"  Again he paused but I said nothing so he went on  "You allowed me Madam a few days since you allowed me to lay claim to your friendshipto interest myself in your concernsto call you by the affectionate title of sisterand the honour you did me no man could have been more sensible of I am ignorant therefore how I have been so unfortunate as to forfeit itbut at present all is changed you fly meyour averted eye shuns to meet mine and you sedulously avoid my conversation"  I was extremely disconcerted at this grave and but too just accusation and I am sure I must look very simplebut I made no answer  "You will not I hope"  continued he  "condemn me unheard if there is any thing I have doneor any thing I have neglected tell me I beseech you  what  and it shall be the whole study of my thoughts how to deserve your pardon"  "Oh my Lord"  cried I penetrated at once with shame and gratitude  "your too too great politeness oppresses meyou have done nothingI have never dreamt of offenceif there is any pardon to be asked it is rather for  me  than for  you  to ask it"  "You are all sweetness and condescension"  cried he  "and I flatter myself you will again allow me to claim those titles which I find myself so unable to forego Yet occupied as I am  with an idea that gives me the severest uneasiness I hope you will not think me impertinent if I still solicit still entreat nay implore you tell me to what cause your late sudden and to me most painful reserve was owing"  "Indeed my Lord"  said I stammering  "I dontI can'tindeed my Lord"  "I am sorry to distress you"  said he  "and ashamed to be so urgentyet I know not how to be satisfied while in ignoranceand the  time  when the change happened makes me apprehendmay I Miss Anville tell you  what  it makes me apprehend"  "Certainly my Lord"  "Tell me then"  and pardon a question most essentially important to meHad or had not Sir Clement Willoughby any share in causing your inquietude  "No my Lord"  answered I with firmness  "none in the world"  "A thousand thousand thanks"  cried he  "you have relieved me from a weight of conjecture which I supported very painfully But one thing more is it in any measure to Sir Clement that I may attribute the alteration in your behaviour to myself which I could not but observe began the very day of his arrival at the Hotwells"  "To Sir Clement my Lord"  said I  "attribute nothing He is the last man in the world who would have any influence over my conduct"  "And will you then restore to me that share of confidence and favour with which you honoured me before he came"  Just then to my great relieffor I knew not what to sayMrs Beaumont opened the door  and in a few minutes we went to breakfast  Lord Orville was all gaiety never did I see him more lively or more agreeable Very soon after Sir Clement Willoughby called to pay his respects he said to Mrs Beaumont I then came to my own roon where indulging my reflections which now soothed and now alarmed me I remained very quietly till I received your most kind letter  Oh Sir how sweet are the prayers you offer for your Evelina how grateful to her are the blessings you pour upon her headYou  commit me to my real parent  Ah Guardian Friend Protector of my youthby whom my helpless infancy was cherished my mind formed my very life preserved  you  are the parent my heart acknowledges and to you do I vow eternal duty gratitude and affection  I look forward to the approaching interview with more fear than hope but important as is this subject I am just now wholly engrossed with another which I must hasten to communicate  I immediately acquainted Mrs Selwyn with the purport of your letter She was charmed to find your opinion agreed with her own and settled that we should go to town tomorrow morning And a chaise i  actually ordered to be here by one o'clock  She then desired me to pack up my cloaths and said she must go herself to  make speeches  and  tell lies  to Mrs Beaumont  When I went down stairs to dinner Lord Orville who was still in excellent spirits reproached me for secluding myself so much from the company He sat next mehe  would  sit next meat table and he might I am sure repeat what  heonce said of me before  that he almost exhausted himself in fruitless endeavours to entertain me  for indeed I was not to be entertained I was totally spiritless and dejected the idea of the approaching meetingand oh Sir the idea of the approaching partinggave a heaviness to my heart that I could neither conquer nor repress I even regretted the half explanation that had passed and wished Lord Orville had supported his own reserve and suffered me to support mine  However when during dinner Mrs Beaumont spoke of our journey my gravity was no longer singular a cloud instantly overspread the countenance of Lord Orville and he became nearly as thoughtful and as silent as myself  We all went together to the drawingroom After a short and unentertaining conversation Mrs Selwyn said she must prepare for her journey and begged me to see for some books she had left in the parlour  And here while I was looking for them I was followed by Lord Orville He shut the door after he came in and approaching me with a look of great anxiety said  "Is this true Miss Anville are you going"  "I believe so my Lord"  said I still looking for the books  "So suddenly so unexpectedly must I lose you"  "No great loss my Lord"  cried I endeavouring to speak chearfully  "Is it possible"  said he gravely  "Miss Anville can doubt my sincerity"  "I can't imagine"  cried I  "what Mrs Selwyn has done with these books"  "Would to Heaven"  continued he  "I might flatter myself you would allow me to prove it"  "I must run up stairs"  cried I greatly confused  "and ask what she has done with them"  "You are going then"  cried he taking my hand  "and you give me not the smallest hope of your returnwill you not then my too lovely friendwill you not at least teach me with fortitude like your own to support your absence"  "My Lord"  cried I endeavouring to disengage my hand  "pray let me go"  "I will"  cried he to my inexpressible confusion dropping on one knee  "if you wish to leave me"  "Oh my Lord"  exclaimed I  "rise I beseech you risesuch a posture to mesurely your Lordship is not so cruel as to mock me"  "Mock you"  repeated he earnestly  "no I revere you I esteem and I admire you above all human beingsyou are the friend to whom my soul is attached as to its better half you are the most amiable the most perfect of women and you are dearer to me than language has the power of telling"  I attempt not to describe my sensations at that moment I scarce breathed I doubted if I existedthe blood forsook my cheeks and my feet refused to sustain me Lord Orville hastily rising supported me to a chair upon which I sunk almost lifeless  For a few minutes we neither of us spoke and then seeing me recover Lord Orville though in terms hardly articulate entreated my pardon  for his abruptness The moment my strength returned I attempted to rise but he would not permit me  I cannot write the scene that followed though every word is engraven on my heart but his protestations his expressions were too flattering for repetition nor would he in spite of my repeated efforts to leave him suffer me to escapein short my dear Sir I was not proof against his solicitationsand he drew from me the most sacred secret of my heart  I know not how long we were together but Lord Orville was upon his knees when the door was opened by Mrs Selwyn To tell you Sir the shame with which I was overwhelmed would be impossibleI snatched my hand from Lord Orvillehe too started and rose and Mrs Selwyn for some instants stood facing us both in silence  At last  "My Lord"  said she sarcastically  "have you been so good as to help Miss Anville to look for my books"  "Yes Madam"  said he attempting to rally  "and I hope we shall soon be able to find them"  "Your Lordship is extremely kind"  said she drily  "but I can by no means consent to take up any more of your time"  Then looking on the windowseat she presently found the books and added  "Come here are just three and so like the servants in the Drummer this important affair may give employment to us all"  She then presented one to Lord Orville another to me and taking a third herself with a most provoking look she left the room  I would instantly have followed her but Lord Orville who could not help laughing begged me  to stay a minute as he had many important matters to discuss  "No indeed my Lord I cannotperhaps I have already stayed too long"  "Does Miss Anville so soon repent her goodness"  "I scarce know what I do my LordI am quite bewildered"  "One hour's conversation"  cried he  "will I hope compose your spirits and confirm my happiness When then may I hope to see you aloneshall you walk in the garden tomorrow before breakfast"  "No no my Lord you must not a second time reproach me with making an  appointment  "  "Do you then"  said he laughing  "reserve that honour only for Mr Macartney"  "Mr Macartney"  said I  "is poor and thinks himself obliged to me otherwise"  "Poverty"  cried he  "I will not plead but if being  obliged  to you has any weight who shall dispute  my  title to an appointment"  "My Lord I can stay no longerMrs Selwyn will lose all patience"  "Deprive her not of the pleasure of her  conjectures  but tell me are you under Mrs Selwyn's care"  "Only for the present my Lord"  "Not a few are the questions I have to ask Miss Anville among them the most important is whether she depends wholly on herself or whether there is any other person for whose interest I must solicit"  "I hardly know my Lord I hardly know myself to whom I most belong  "Suffer suffer me then"  cried he with warmth  "to hasten the time when that shall no longer admit a doubtwhen your grateful Orville may call you all his own"  At length but with difficulty I broke from him I went however to my own room for I was too much agitated to follow Mrs Selwyn Good God my dear Sir what a scene surely the meeting for which I shall prepare tomorrow cannot so greatly affect me To be loved by Lord Orvilleto be the honoured choice of his noble heartmy happiness seemed too infinite to be borne and I wept even bitterly I wept from the excess of joy which overpowered me  In this state of almost painful felicity I continued till I was summoned to tea When I reentered the drawingroom I rejoiced much to find it full of company as the confusion with which I met Lord Orville was rendered the less observable  Immediately after tea most of the company played at cards and thenand till suppertime Lord Orville devoted himself wholly to me  He saw that my eyes were red and would not let me rest till he had made me confess the cause and when though most reluctantly I had acknowledged my weakness I could with difficulty refrain from weeping again at the gratitude he expressed  He earnestly desired to know if my journey could not be postponed and when I said no entreated permission to attend me to town  "Oh my Lord"  cried I  "what a request"  "The sooner"  answered he  "I make my devotion to you public the sooner I may expect  from your delicacy you will convince the world you encourage no mere  danglers  "  "You teach me then my Lord the inference I might expect if I complied"  "And can you wonder I should seek to hasten  he happy time when no scruples no discretion will demand our separation and when the most punctilious delicacy will rather promote than oppose my happiness in attending you"  To this I was silent and he reurged his request  "My Lord"  said I  "you ask what I have no power to grant This journey will deprive me of all right to act for myself"  "What does Miss Anville mean"  "I cannot now explain myself indeed if I could the task would be both painful and tedious"  "O Miss Anville"  cried he  "when may I hope to date the period of this mystery when flatter myself that my promised friend will indeed honour me with her confidence"  "My Lord"  cried I  "I mean not to affect any mysterybut my affairs are so circumstanced that a long and most unhappy story can alone explain them However if a short suspence will give your Lordship any uneasiness"  "My beloved Miss Anville"  cried he eagerly  "pardon my impatienceYou shall tell me nothing you would wish to concealI will wait your own time for information and trust to your goodness for its speed"  "There is  nothing  my Lord I wish to concealto  postpone  an explanation is all I desire"  He then requested that since I would not allow him to accompany me to town I would permit him to write to me and promise to answer his letters  A sudden recollection of the two letters which had already passed between us occurring to me I hastily answered  "No indeed my Lord"  "I am extremely sorry"  said he gravely  "that you think me too presumptuous I must own I had flattered myself that to soften the inquietude of an absence which seems attended by so many inexplicable circumstances would not have been to incur your displeasure"  This seriousness hurt me and I could not forbear saying  "Can you indeed desire my Lord that I should a second time expose myself by an unguarded readiness to write to you"  "A  second time unguarded readiness  "  repeated he  "you amaze me"  "Has your Lordship then quite forgot the foolish letter I was so imprudent as to send you when in town"  "I have not the least idea"  cried he  "of what you mean"  "Why then my Lord"  said I  "we had better let the subject drop"  "Impossible"  cried he  "I cannot rest without an explanation"  And then he obliged me to speak very openly of both the letters but my dear Sir imagine my surprise when he assured me in the most solemn manner that far from having ever written me a single line he had never received seen or heard of my letter  This subject which caused mutual astonishment and perplexity to us both entirely engrossed us for the rest of the evening and he made me promise to shew him the letter I had received in his name tomorrow morning that he might endeavour to discover the author  After supper the conversation became general  And now my dearest Sir may I not call for your congratulations upon the events of this day a day never to be recollected by me but with the most grateful joy I know how much you are inclined to think well of Lord Orville I cannot therefore apprehend that my frankness to him will displease you Perhaps the time is not very distant when your Evelina's choice may receive the sanction of her best friend's judgment and approbationwhich seems now all she has to wish  In regard to the change in my situation which must first take place surely I cannot be blamed for what has passed the partiality of Lord Orville must not only reflect honour upon me but upon all to whom I do or may belong  Adieu most dear Sir I will write again when I arrive at London  LETTER XXXI  Evelina in continuation  Clifton  Oct th  YOU will see my dear Sir that I was mistaken in supposing I should write no more from this  place where my residence now seems more uncertain than ever  This morning during breakfast Lord Orville took an opportunity to beg me in a low voice to allow him a moment's conversation before I left Clifton  "May I hope"  added he  "that you will stroll into the garden after breakfast"  I made no answer but I believe my looks gave no denial for indeed I much wished to be satisfied concerning the letter The moment therefore that I could quit the parlour I ran up stairs for my calash but before I reached my room Mrs Selwyn called after me  "If you are going to walk Miss Anville be so good as to bid Jenny bring down my hat and I'll accompany you"  Very much disconcerted I turned into the drawingroom without making any answer and there I hoped to wait unseen till she had otherwise disposed of herself But in a few minutes the door opened and Sir Clement Willoughby entered  Starting at the sight of him in rising hastily I let drop the letter which I had brought for Lord Orville's inspection and before I could recover it Sir Clement springing forward had it in his hand He was just presenting it to me and at the same time enquiring after my health when the signature caught his eye and he read aloud  "Orville"  I endeavoured eagerly to snatch it from him but he would not permit me and holding it fast in a passionate manner exclaimed  "Good God Miss Anville is it possible you can value such a letter as this"  The question surprised and confounded me and I was too much ashamed to answer him but  finding he made an attempt to secure it I prevented him and vehemently demanded him to return it  "Tell me first"  said he holding it above my reach  "tell me if you have since received any more letters from the same person"  "No indeed"  cried I  "never"  "And will you also sweetest of women promise that you never  will  receive any more Say that and you will make me the happiest of men"  "Sir Clement"  cried I greatly confused  "pray give me the letter"  "And will you not first satisfy my doubtswill you not relieve me from the torture of the most distracting suspencetell me but that the detested Orville has written to you no more"  "Sir Clement"  cried I angrily  "you have no right to make any conditionsso pray give me the letter directly"  "Why such solicitude about this hateful letter can it possibly deserve your eagerness tell me with truth with sincerity tell me Does it really merit the least anxiety"  "No matter Sir"  cried I in great perplexity  "the letter is mine and therefore"  "I must conclude then"  said he  "that the letter deserves your utmost contemptbut that the name of Orville is sufficient to make you prize it"  "Sir Clement"  cried I colouring  "you are quiteyou are very muchthe letter is not"  "O Miss Anville"  cried he  "you blushyou stammerGreat Heaven it is then all as I feared"  "I know not"  cried I half frightened  "what you mean but I beseech you to give me the letter and to compose yourself"  "The letter"  cried he gnashing his teeth  "you shall never see more You ought to have burnt it the moment you had read it"  And in an instant he tore it into a thousand pieces  Alarmed at a fury so indecently outrageous I would have run out of the room but he caught hold of my gown and cried  "Not yet not yet must you go I am but halfmad yet and you must stay to finish your work Tell me therefore does Orville know your fatal partialitySay  yes  "  added he trembling with passion  "and I will fly you for ever"  "For Heaven's sake Sir Clement"  cried I  "release meif you do not you will force me to call for help"  "Call then"  cried he  "inexorable and most unfeeling girl call if you please and bid all the world witness your triumphbut could ten worlds obey your call I would not part from you till you had answered me Tell me then does Orville know you love him"  At any other time an enquiry so gross would have given me inexpressible confusion but now the wildness of his manner terrified me and I only said  "Whatever you wish to know Sir Clement I will tell you another time but for the present I entreat you to let me go"  "Enough"  cried he  "I understand youthe art of Orville has prevailedcold inanimate phlegmatic as he is you have rendered him the most envied of menOne thing more and I have doneWill he marry you  What a question my cheeks glowed with indignation  and I felt too proud to make any answer  "I see I see how it is"  cried he after a short pause  "and I find I am undone for ever"  Then letting loose my gown he put his hand to his forehead and walked up and down the room in a hasty and agitated manner  Though now at liberty to go I had not the courage to leave him for his evident distress excited all my compassion And this was our situation when Lady Louisa Mr Coverley and Mrs Beaumont entered the room  "Sir Clement Willoughby"  said the latter  "I beg pardon for making you wait so long but"  She had not time for another word Sir Clement too much disordered to know or care what he did snatched up his hat and brushing hastily past her flew down stairs and out of the house  And with him went my sincerest pity though I earnestly hope I shall see him no more But what my dear Sir am I to conclude from his strange speeches concerning the letter does it not seem as if he was himself the author of it How else should he be so well acquainted with the contempt it merits Neither do I know another human being who could serve any interest by such a deception I remember too that just as I had given my own letter to the maid Sir Clement came into the shop probably he prevailed upon her by some bribery to give it to him and afterwards by the same means to deliver to me an answer of his own writing Indeed I can in no other manner account for this affair Oh Sir Clement were you not yourself unhappy I know not how I could pardon an artifice that has caused me so much uneasiness  His abrupt departure occasioned a kind of general consternation  "Very extraordinary behaviour this"  cried Mrs Beaumont  "Egad"  said Mr Coverley  "the Baronet has a mind to tip us a touch of the heroicks this morning  "I declare"  cried Lady Louisa  "I never saw any thing so monstrous in my life it's quite abominableI fancy the man's madI'm sure he has given me a shocking fright"  Soon after Mrs Selwyn came up stairs with Lord Merton The former advancing hastily to me said  "Miss Anville have you an almanack"  "Meno Ma'am"  "Who has one then"  "Egad"  cried Mr Coverley  "I never bought one in my life it would make me quite melancholy to have such a timekeeper in my pocket I would as soon walk all day before an hourglass"  "You are in the right"  said Mrs Selwyn  "not to  watch time  lest you should be betrayed unawares into reflecting how you employ it"  "Egad Ma'am"  cried he  "if Time thought no more of me than I do of Time I believe I should bid defiance for one while to oldage and wrinklesfor deuce take me if ever I think about it at all"  "Pray Mr Coverley"  said Mrs Selwyn  "why do you think it necessary to tell me this so often"  "Often"  repeated he  "Egad Madam I don't know why I said it nowbut I'm sure I can't recollect that I ever owned as much before"  "Owned it before"  cried she  "why my dear Sir you own it all day long for every word every look every action proclaims it"  I know not if he understood the full severity of her satire but he only turned off with a laugh and she then applied to Mr Lovel and asked if  he  had an almanack  Mr Lovel who always looks alarmed when she addresses him with some hesitation answered  "I assure you Ma'am I have no manner of antipathy to an almanacknone in the least I assure youI dare say I have four or five"  "Four or fivepray may I ask what use you make of so many"  "Usereally Ma'am as to thatI don't make any particular use of thembut one must have them to tell one the day of the monthI'm sure else I should never keep it in my head"  "And does your time pass so smoothly unmarked that without an almanack you could not distinguish one day from another"  "Really Ma'am"  cried he colouring  "I don't see any thing so very particular in having a few almanacks other people have them I believe as well as me"  "Don't be offended"  cried she  "I have but made a little digression All I want to know is the state of the moonfor if it is at the  full  I shall be saved a world of conjectures and know at once to what cause to attribute the inconsistencies I have witnessed this morning In the first place I heard Lord Orville excuse himself from going out because he had business of importance to transact at homeyet have I seen him sauntering alone in the garden this halfhour Miss Anville on the other hand I invited to walk out  with me and after seeking her every where round the house I find her quietly seated in the drawingroom And but a few minutes since Sir Clement Willoughby with even more than his usual politeness told me he was come to spend the morning herewhen just now I met him flying down stairs as if pursued by the Furies and far from repeating his compliments or making any excuse he did not even answer a question I asked him but rushed past me with the rapidity of a thief from a bailiff"  "I protest"  said Mrs Beaumont  "I can't think what he meant such rudeness from a man of any family is quite incomprehensible"  "My Lord"  cried Lady Louisa to Lord Merton  "do you know he did the same by  me  I was just going to ask him what was the matter but he ran past me so quick that I declare he quite dazzled my eyes You can't think my Lord how he frighted me I dare say I look as paledon't I look very pale my Lord"  "Your Ladyship"  said Mr Lovel  "so well becomes the lilies that the roses might blush to see themselves so excelled"  "Pray Mr Lovel"  said Mrs Selwyn  "if the roses should blush how would you find it out"  "Egad"  cried Mr Coverley  "I suppose they must blush as the saying is like a blue dogfor they are  red  already"  "Prithee Jack"  said Lord Merton  "don't you pretend to talk about blushes that never knew what they were in your life"  "My Lord"  said Mrs Selwyn  "if experience alone can justify mentioning them what an admirable treatise upon the subject may we not expect from your Lordship"  "O pray Ma'am"  answered he  "stick to Jack Coverleyhe's your only man for my part I confess I have a mortal aversion to arguments"  "O fie my Lord"  cried Mrs Selwyn  a senator of the nation a member of the noblest parliament in the worldand yet neglect the art of oratory"  "Why faith my Lord"  said Mr Lovel  "I think in general your House is not much addicted to study we of the lower House have indubitably most application and if I did not speak before a superior power"  bowing low to Lord Merton  I should presume to add we have likewise the most able speakers"  "Mr Lovel"  said Mrs Selwyn  "you deserve immortality for that discovery But for this observation and the confession of Lord Merton I protest I should have supposed that a peer of the realm and an able logician were synonymous terms"  Lord Merton turning upon his heel asked Lady Louisa if she should  take the air  before dinner  "Really"  answered she  "I don't knowI'm afraid it's monstrous hot besides"  putting her hand to her forehead  "I a'n't half well it's quite horrid to have such weak nervesthe least thing in the world discomposes me I declare that man's oddness has given me such a shockI don't know when I shall recover from it But I'm a sad weak creaturedon't you think I am my Lord"  "O by no means"  answered he  "your Ladyship is merely delicateand devil take me if ever I had the least passion for an amazon"  "I have the honour to be quite of your Lordship's opinion"  "said Mr Lovel looking maliciously at Mrs Selwyn  "for I have an insuperable aversion to strength either of body or mind in a female"  "Faith and so have I"  said Mr Coverley  "for egad I'd as soon see a woman chop wood as hear her chop logic"  "So would every man in his senses"  said Lord Merton  "for a woman wants nothing to recommend her but beauty and goodnature in every thing else she is either impertinent or unnatural For my part deuce take me if ever I wish to hear a word of sense from a woman as long as live"  "It has always been agreed"  said Mrs Selwyn looking round her with the utmost contempt  "that no man ought to be connected with a woman whose understanding is superior to his own Now I very much fear that to accommodate all this good company according to such a rule would be utterly impracticable unless we should chuse subjects from Swift's hospital of idiots"  How many enemies my dear Sir does this unbounded severity excite Lord Merton however only whistled Mr Coverley sang and Mr Lovel after biting his lips some time said  "'Pon honour that ladyif she was  not  a ladyI should be half tempted to observethat there is somethingin such severitythat is rather I must sayrather  oddish  "  Just then a servant brought Lady Louisa a note upon a  waiter  which is a ceremony always used to her Ladyship and I took the opportunity of this interruption to the conversation to steal out of the room  I went immediately to the parlour which I found quite empty for I did not dare walk in the garden after what Mrs Selwyn had said  In a few minutes a servant announced Mr Macartney saying as he entered the room that he would acquaint Lord Orville he was there  Mr Macartney rejoiced much at finding me alone He told me he had taken the liberty to enquire for Lord Orville by way of pretext for coming to the house  I then very eagerly enquired if he had seen his father  "I have Madam"  said he  "and the generous compassion you have shewn made me hasten to acquaint you that upon reading my unhappy mother's letter he did not hesitate to acknowledge me"  Good God"  cried I with no little emotion  "how similar are our circumstances And did he receive you kindly"  "I could not Madam expect that he would the cruel transaction that obliged me to fly Paris was too recent in his memory"  "Andhave you seen the young lady"  "No Madam"  said he mournfully  "I was forbid her sight"  "Forbid her sightand why"  "Partly perhaps from prudenceand partly from the remains of a resentment which will not easily subside I only requested leave to acquaint her with my relationship and be allowed to call her sisterbut it was denied me  You have  sister  said Sir John  you must forget her existence  Hard and vain command"  "You have you have a sister"  cried I from an impulse of pity which I could not repress  "a sister who is most warmly interested in all your concerns and who only wants opportunity to manifest her friendship and regard"  "Gracious Heaven"  cried he  "what does Miss Anville mean  "Anville"  said I  "is not my real name Sir John Belmont is my fatherhe is your'sand I am your sisterYou see therefore the claim we mutually have to each other's regard we are not merely bound by the ties of friendship but by those of blood I feel for you already all the affection of a sisterI felt it indeed before I knew I was oneWhy my dear brother do you not speakdo you hesitate to acknowledge me"  "I am so lost in astonishment"  cried he  "that I know not if I hear right"  "I have then found a brother"  cried I holding out my hand  "and he will not own me"  "Own youOh Madam"  cried he accepting my offered hand  "is it indeed possible  you  can own  me  a poor wretched adventurer who so lately had no support but from your generositywhom your benevolence snatched from utter destructionCan  you  Oh Madam can you indeed and without a blush condescend to own such an outcast for a brother"  "Oh forbear forbear"  cried I  "is this language proper for a sister are we not reciprocally bound to each otherWill you not suffer me to expect from  you  all the good offices in your powerBut tell me where is our father at present"  "At the Hotwell Madam he arrived there yesterday morning"  I would have proceeded with further questions but the entrance of Lord Orville prevented me The moment he saw us he started and would have retreated but drawing my hand from Mr Macartney's I begged him to come in  For a few moments we were all silent and I believe all in equal confusion Mr Macartney however recollecting himself said  "I hope your Lordship will forgive the liberty I have taken in making use of your name"  Lord Orville rather coldly bowed but said nothing  Again we were all silent and then Mr Macartney took leave  "I fancy"  said Lord Orville when he was gone  "I have shortened Mr Macartney's visit"  "No my Lord not at all"  "I had presumed"  said he with some hesitation  "I should have seen Miss Anville in the gardenbut I knew not she was so much better engaged"  Before I could answer a servant came to tell me the chaise was ready and that Mrs Selwyn was enquiring for me  "I will wait on her immediately"  cried I and away I was running but Lord Orville stopping me said with great emotion  "Is it thus Miss Anville you leave me"  "My Lord"  cried I  "how can I help itperhaps soon some better opportunity may offer"  "Good Heaven"  cried he  "do you indeed take me for a Stoic What better opportunity  may I hope foris not the chaise comeare you not going have you even deigned to tell me whither"  "My journey my Lord will now be deferred Mr Macartney has brought me intelligence which renders it at present unnecessary"  "Mr Macartney"  said he gravely  "seems to have great influenceyet he is a very young counsellor"  "Is it possible my Lord Mr Macartney can give you the least uneasiness"  "My dearest Miss Anville"  said he taking my hand  "I see and I adore the purity of your mind superior as it is to all little arts and all apprehensions of suspicion and I should do myself as well as you injustice if I were capable of harbouring the smallest doubts of that goodness which makes you mine for ever nevertheless pardon me if I own myself surprisednay alarmed at these frequent meetings with so young a man as Mr Macartney"  "My Lord"  cried I eager to clear myself  "Mr Macartney is my brother"  "Your brother you amaze meWhat strange mystery then makes his relationship a secret"  Just then Mrs Selwyn opened the door  "O you are here"  cried she  "Pray is my Lord so kind as to assist you in  preparing  for your journeyor in  retarding  it"  "I should be most happy"  said Lord Orville smiling  "if it were in my power to do the  latter  "  I then acquainted her with Mr Macartney's communication  She immediately ordered the chaise away and then took me into her own room to consider what should be done  A few minutes sufficed to determine her and she wrote the following note  To Sir John Belmont Bart  MRS Selwyn presents her compliments to Sir John Belmont and if he is at leisure will be glad to wait on him this morning upon business of importance  She then ordered her man to enquire at the pump room for a direction and went herself to Mrs Beaumont to apologise for deferring her journey  An answer was presently returned that he would be glad to see her  She would have had me immediately accompany her to the Hotwells but I entreated her to spare me the distress of so abrupt an introduction and to pave the way for my reception She consented rather reluctantly and attended only by her servant walked to the Wells  She was not absent two hours yet so miserably did time seem to linger that I thought a thousand accidents had happened and feared she would never return I passed the whole time in my own room for I was too much agitated even to converse with Lord Orville  The instant that from my window I saw her returning I flew down stairs and met her in the garden  We both walked to the arbour  Her looks in which disappointment and anger were expressed presently announced to me the failure of her embassy Finding that she did not speak I asked her in a faultering voice Whether or not I had a father  "You have  not  my dear"  said she abruptly  "Very well Madam"  said I with tolerable calmness  "let the chaise then be ordered againI will go to Berry Hilland there I trust I shall still find one"  It was some time ere she could give or I could hear the account of her visit and then she related it in a hasty manner yet I believe I can recollect every word  "I found Sir John alone He received me with the utmost politeness I did not keep him a moment in suspence as to the purport of my visit But I had no sooner made it known than with a supercilious smile he said  "And have you Madam been prevailed upon to revive that ridiculous old story"  Ridiculous I told him was a term which he would find no one else do him the favour to make use of in speaking of the horrible actions belonging to the  old story  he made so light of  "actions"  continued I  "which would dye still deeper the black annals of Nero or Caligula"  He attempted in vain to rally for I pursued him with all the severity in my power and ceased not painting the enormity of his crime till I stung him to the quick and in a voice of passion and impatience he said  "No more Madamthis is not a subject upon which I need a monitor"  "Make then"  cried I  "the only reparation in your powerYour daughter is now at Clifton send for her hither and in the face of the world proclaim the legitimacy  of her birth and clear the reputation of your injured wife"  "Madam"  said he  "you are much mistaken if you suppose I waited for the honour of this visit before I did what little justice now depends upon me to the memory of that unfortunate woman her daughter has been my care from her infancy I have taken her into my house she bears my name and she will be my sole heiress"  For some time this assertion appeared so absurd that I only laughed at it but at last he assured me I had myself been imposed upon for that the very woman who attended Lady Belmont in her last illness conveyed the child to him while he was in London before she was a year old  "Unwilling"  he added  "at that time to confirm the rumour of my being married I sent the woman with the child to France as soon as she was old enough I put her into a convent where she has been properly educated and now I have taken her home I have acknowledged her for my lawful child and paid at length to the memory of her unhappy mother a tribute of fame which has made me wish to hide myself hereafter from all the world"  This whole story sounded so improbable that I did not scruple to tell him I discredited every word He then rung his bell and enquiring if his hairdresser was come said he was sorry to leave me but that if I would favour him with my company tomorrow he would do himself the honour of introducing Miss Belmont to  me  instead of troubling me to introduce her to  him  I rose in great indignation and assuring him I would make his conduct as public as it was infamous I left the house"  "Good Heaven how strange a recital how incomprehensible an affair The Miss Belmont  then who is actually at Bristol passes for the daughter of my unhappy motherpasses in short for your Evelina Who she can be or what this tale can mean I have not any idea  Mrs Selwyn soon after left me to my own reflections Indeed they were not very pleasant Quietly as I had borne her relation the moment I was alone I felt most bitterly both the disgrace and the sorrow of a rejection so cruelly inexplicable  I know not how long I might have continued in this situation had I not been awakened from my melancholy reverie by the voice of Lord Orville  "May I come in"  cried he  "or shall I interrupt you"  I was silent and he seated himself next me  "I fear"  he continued  "Miss Anville will think I persecute her yet so much as I have to say and so much as I wish to hear with so few opportunities for either she cannot wonderand I hope she will not be offendedthat I seize with such avidity every moment in my power to converse with her You are grave"  added he taking my hand  "I hope you do not regret the delay of your journeyI hope the pleasure it gives to  me  will not be a subject of pain to  you  You are silentSomething I am sure has afflicted youWould to Heaven I were able to console youWould to Heaven I were worthy to participate in your sorrows"  My heart was too full to bear this kindness and I could only answer by my tears  "Good Heaven"  cried he  "how you alarm meMy love my sweet Miss Anville deny me no longer to be the sharer of your griefstell me at least that you have not withdrawn your esteemthat you do not repent the goodness you have shewn  methat you still think me the same grateful Orville whose heart you have deigned to accept"  "Oh my Lord"  cried I  "your generosity overpowers me"  And I wept like an infant For now that all my hopes of being acknowledged seemed finally crushed I felt the nobleness of his disinterested attachment so forcibly that I could scarce breathe under the weight of gratitude that oppressed me  He seemed greatly shocked and in terms the most flattering the most respectfully tender he at once soothed my distress and urged me to tell him its cause  "My Lord"  said I when I was able to speak  "you little know what an outcast you have honoured with your choicea child of bountyan orphan from infancydependent even for subsistence dependent upon the kindness of compassionRejected by my natural friendsdisowned for ever by my nearest relationOh my Lord so circumstanced can I deserve the distinction with which you honour me No no I feel the inequality too painfullyyou must leave me my Lord you must suffer me to return to obscurityand there in the bosom of my first bestmy only friendI will pour forth all the grief of my heartwhile you my Lord must seek elsewhere"  I could not proceed my whole soul recoiled against the charge I would have given and my voice refused to utter it  "Never"  cried he warmly  "my heart is your's and I swear to you an attachment eternalYou prepare me indeed for a tale of horror and I am almost breathless with expectationbut so firm is my conviction that whatever  are your misfortunes to have merited them is not of the number that I feel myself more strongly more invincibly attached to you than everTell me but where I may find this noble friend whose virtues you have already taught me to reverenceand I will fly to obtain his consent and intercessionthat henceforward our fates may be indissolubly unitedand then shall it be the sole study of my life to endeavour to soften your pastand guard you from future misfortunes"  I had just raised my eyes to answer this most generous of men when the first object they met was Mrs Selwyn  "So my dear"  cried she  "what still courting the rural shadesI thought ere now you would have been satiated with this retired seat and I have been seeking you all over the House But I now see the only way to meet with  you  is to enquire for  Lord Orville  However don't let me disturb your meditations you are possibly planning some pastoral dialogue"  And with this provoking speech she walked on  In the greatest confusion I was quitting the arbour when Lord Orville said  "permit  me  to follow Mrs Selwynit is time to put an end to all impertinent conjectures will you allow me to speak to her openly  I assented in silence and he left me  I then went to my own room where I continued till I was summoned to dinner after which Mrs Selwyn invited me to her's  The moment she had shut the door  "Your Ladyship"  said she  "will I hope be seated"  "Ma'am"  cried I staring  "O the sweet innocent so you don't know what I meanbut my dear my sole view is to accustom you a little to your dignity elect lest when you are addressed by your title you should look another way from an apprehension of listening to a discourse not meant for you to hear"  Having in this manner diverted herself with my confusion till her raillery was almost exhausted she congratulated me very seriously upon the attachment of Lord Orville and painted to me in the strongest terms his disinterested desire of being married to me immediately She had told him she said my whole story and yet he was willing nay eager that our union should take place of any further application to my family  "Now my dear"  continued she  "I advise you by all means to marry him directly nothing can be more precarious than our success with Sir John and the young men of this age are not to be trusted with too much time for deliberation where their interests are concerned"  "Good God Madam"  cried I  "do you think I would  hurry  Lord Orville  "Well do as you will"  said she  "luckily you have an excellent subject for Quixotismotherwise this delay might prove your ruin but Lord Orville is almost as romantic as if he had been born and bred at Berry Hill"  She then proposed as no better expedient seemed likely to be suggested that I should accompany her at once in her visit to the Hotwells tomorrow morning  The very idea made me tremble yet she represented so strongly the necessity of pursuing this unhappy affair with spirit or giving it totally up  that wanting her force of argument I was almost obliged to yield to her proposal  In the evening we all walked in the garden and Lord Orville who never quitted my side told me he had been listening to a tale which though it had removed the perplexities that had so long tormented him had penetrated him with sorrow and compassion I acquainted him with Mrs Selwyn's plan for tomorrow and confessed the extreme terror it gave me He then in a manner almost unanswerable besought me to leave to him the conduct of the affair by consenting to be his before an interview took place  I could not but acknowledge my sense of his generousity but I told him I was wholly dependent upon you and that I was certain your opinion would be the same as mine which was that it would be highly improper I should dispose of myself for ever so very near the time which must finally decide by whose authority I ought to be guided The subject of this dreaded meeting with the thousand conjectures and apprehensions to which it gives birth employed all our conversation then as it has all my thoughts since  Heaven only knows how I shall support myself when the longexpectedthe wishedyet terrible moment arrives that will prostrate me at the feet of the nearest the most reverenced of all relations whom my heart yearns to know and longs to love  LETTER XXXII  Evelina in continuation  Clifton  Oct  I COULD not write yesterday so violent was the agitation of my mindbut I will not now lose a moment till I have hastened to my best friend an account of the transactions of a day I can never recollect without emotion  Mrs Selwyn determined upon sending no message  "Lest"  said she  "Sir John fatigued with the very idea of my reproaches should endeavour to avoid a meeting all we have to do is to take him by surprize He cannot but see who you are whether he will do you justice or not"  We went early and in Mrs Beaumont's chariot into which Lord Orville uttering words of the kindest encouragement handed us both  My uneasiness during the ride was excessive but when we stopped at the door I was almost senseless with terror the meeting at last was not so dreadful as that moment I believe I was carried into the house but I scarce recollect what was done with me however I know we remained some time in the parlour ere Mrs Selwyn could send any message up stairs  When I was somewhat recovered I entreated her to let me return home assuring her I felt myself quite unequal to supporting the interview  "No"  said she  "you must stay now your fears will but gain strength by delay and we must not have such a shock as this repeated"  Then turning to the servant she sent up her name  An answer was brought that he was going out in great haste but would attend her immediately I turned so sick that Mrs Selwyn was apprehensive I should have fainted and opening a door which led to an inner apartment she begged me to wait there till I was somewhat composed and till she had prepared for my reception  Glad of every moment's reprieve I willingly agreed to the proposal and Mrs Selwyn had but just time to shut me in ere her presence was necessary  The voice of a  father  Oh dear and revered namewhich then for the first time struck my earsaffected me in a manner I cannot describe though it was only employed to give orders to a servant as he came down stairs  Then entering the parlour I heard him say  "I am sorry madam I made you wait but I have an engagement which now calls me away however if you have any commands for me I shall be glad of the honour of your company some other time"  "I am come Sir"  answered Mrs Selwyn  "to introduce to you your daughter"  "I am infinitely obliged to you"  answered he  "but I have just had the satisfaction of breakfasting with her Ma'am your most obedient"  "You refuse then to see her"  "I am much indebted to you Madam for this desire of encreasing my family but you must excuse me if decline taking advantage of it I have already a daughter to whom I owe every thing and it is not three days since that I had the pleasure of discovering a son how many more sons and daughters may be brought to me I am yet to learnbut I am already perfectly well satisfied with the size of my family"  "Had you a thousand children Sir John"  said Mrs Selwyn warmly  "this only one of which Lady Belmont was the mother ought to be most distinguished and far from avoiding her sight you should thank your stars in humble gratitude that there vet remains in your power the smallest opportunity of doing the injured wife you have destroyed the poor justice of acknowledging her child"  "I am very unwilling Madam"  answered he  "to enter into any discussion of this point but you are determined to compel me to speak There lives not at this time the human being who should talk to  me  of the regret due to the memory of that illfated woman no one can feel it so severely as myself but let me nevertheless assure you I have already done all that remained in my power to prove the respect she merited from me her child I have educated and owned for my lawful heiress if Madam you can suggest to me any other means by which I may more fully do her justice and more clearly manifest her innocence name them to me and though they should wound my character still deeper I will perform them readily"  "All this sounds vastly well"  returned Mrs Selwyn  "but I must own it is rather too enigmatical  for  my  faculties of comprehension You can however have no objection to seeing this young lady"  "None in the world"  "Come forth then my dear"  cried she opening the door  "come forth and see your father"  Then taking my trembling hand she led me forward I would have withdrawn it and retreated but as he advanced instantly towards me I found myself already before him  What a moment for your Evelinaan involuntary scream escaped me and covering my face with my hands I sunk on the floor  He had however seen me first for in a voice scarce articulate he exclaimed  "My God does Caroline Evelyn still live"  Mrs Selwyn said something but I could not listen to her and in a few minutes he added  "Lift up thy headif my sight has not blasted theelift up thy head thou image of my longlost Caroline"  Affected beyond measure I half arose and embraced his knees while yet on my own  "Yes yes"  cried he looking earnestly in my face  "I see I see thou art her child she livesshe breathesshe is present to my viewOh God that she indeed livedGo child go"  added he wildly starting and pushing me from him  "take her away MadamI cannot bear to look at her"  And then breaking hastily from me he rushed out of the room  Speechless motionless myself I attempted not to stop him but Mrs Selwyn hastening after him caught hold of his arm  "Leave me Madam"  cried he with quickness  "and take care of the poor childbid her not think me unkindtell her I would at this moment plunge a  dagger in my heart to serve herbut she has set my brain on fire and I can see her no more"  Then with violence almost frantic he ran up stairs  Oh Sir had I not indeed cause to dread this interviewan interview so unspeakably painful and afflicting to us both Mrs Selwyn would have immediately returned to Clifton but I intreated her to wait some time in the hope that my unhappy father when his first emotion was over would again bear me in his sight However he soon after sent his servant to enquire how I did and to tell Mrs Selwyn he was much indisposed but would hope for the honour of seeing her tomorrow at any time she would please to appoint  She fixed upon ten o'clock in the morning and then with a heavy heart I got into the chariot Those afflicting words  I can see her no more  were never a moment absent from my mind  Yet the sight of Lord Orville who handed us from the carriage gave some relief to the sadness of my thoughts I could not however enter upon the painful subject but begging Mrs Selwyn to satisfy him I went to my own room  As soon as I communicated to the good Mrs Clinton the present situation of my affairs an idea occurred to her which seemed to clear up all the mystery of my having been so long disowned  The woman she says who attended my evertoberegretted mother in her last illness and who nursed me the first four months of my life soon after being discharged from your house left Berry Hill entirely with her baby who was but six weeks older than myself Mrs Clinton remembers that her quitting the place appeared at the time very extraordinary to the neighbours but  as she was never heard of afterwards she was by degrees quite forgotten  The moment this was mentioned it struck Mrs Selwyn as well as Mrs Clinton herself that my father had been imposed upon and that the nurse who said she had brought his child to him had in fact carried her own  The name by which I was known the secrecy observed in regard to my family and the retirement in which I lived all conspired to render this scheme however daring and fraudulent by no means impracticable and in short the idea was no sooner started than conviction seemed to follow it  Mrs Selwyn determined immediately to discover the truth or mistake of this conjecture therefore the moment she had dined she walked to the Hotwells attended by Mrs Clinton  I waited in my room till her return and then heard the following account of her visit  She found my poor father in great agitation She immediately informed him of the occasion of her so speedy return and of her suspicions of the woman who had pretended to convey to him his child Interrupting her with quickness he said he had just sent her from his presence that the certainty I carried in my countenance of my real birth made him the moment he had recovered from a surprise which had almost deprived him of reason suspect himself the imposition she mentioned He had therefore sent for the woman and questioned her with the utmost austerity she turned pale and was extremely embarrassed but still she persisted in affirming that she had really brought him the daughter of Lady Belmont His perplexity he said almost distracted him he had  always  observed that his daughter bore no resemblance  of either of her parents but as he had never doubted the veraci  y of the nurse this circumstance did not give birth to any suspicion  At Mrs Selwyn's desire the woman was again called and interrogated with equal art and severity her confusion was evident and her answers often contradictory yet she still declared she was no impostor  "We will see that in a minute"  said Mrs Selwyn and then desired Mrs Clinton might be called up stairs The poor wretch changing colour would have escaped out of the room but being prevented dropt on her knees and implored forgiveness A confession of the whole affair was then extorted from her  Doubtless my dear Sir you must remember  Dame Green  who was my first nurse The deceit she has practised was suggested she says by a conversation she overheard in which my unhappy mother besought you that if her child survived her you would take the sole care of its education and in particular if it should be a female you would by no means part with her early in life You not only consented she says but assured her you would even retire abroad with me yourself if my father should importunately demand me Her own child she said was then in her arms and she could not forbear wishing it were possible to give  her  the fortune which seemed so little valued for me This wish once raised was not easily suppressed on the contrary what at first appeared a mere idle desire in a short time seemed a feasible scheme Her husband was dead and she had little regard for any body but her child and in short having saved money for the journey she contrived to enquire a direction to my father and telling her neighbours she was  going to settle in Devonshire she set out on her expedition  When Mrs Selwyn asked her how she dared to perpetrate such a fraud she protested she had no ill designs but that as  Miss  would be never the worse for it she thought it a pity  nobody  should be the better  Her success we are already acquainted with Indeed every thing seemed to contribute to wards it my father had no correspondent at Berry Hill the child was instantly sent to France where being brought up in as much retirement as myself nothing but accident could discover the fraud  And here let me indulge myself in observing and rejoicing to observe that the total neglect I thought I met with was not the effect of insensibility or unkindness but of imposition and error and that at the very time we concluded I was unnaturally rejected my deluded father meant to shew me most favour and protection  He acknowledges that lady Howard's letter flung him into some perplexity he immediately communicated it to Dame Green who confessed it was the greatest shock she had ever received in her life yet she had the art and boldness to assert that Lady Howard must herself have been deceived and as she had from the beginning of her enterprize declared she had stolen away the child without your knowledge she concluded that some deceit was  then  intended him and this thought occasioned his abrupt answer  Dame Green owned that from the moment the journey to England was settled she gave herself up for lost All her hope was to have had her daughter married before it took place for which reason she had so much promoted Mr Macartney's addresses for though such a match was inadequate  to the pretensions of  Miss Belmont  she well knew it was far superior to those  her daughter  could form after the discovery of her birth  My first enquiry was if this innocent daughter was yet acquainted with the affair No Mrs Selwyn said nor was any plan settled how to divulge it to her Poor unfortunate girl how hard is her fate she is entitled to my kindest offices and I shall always consider her as my sister  I then asked whether my father would again allow me to see him  "Why no my dear not yet"  answered she  "he declares the sight of you is too much for him however we are to settle every thing concerning you tomorrow for this woman took up all our time today"  This morning therefore she is again gone to the Hotwells I am waiting in all impatience for her return but as I know you will be anxious for the account this letter contains I will not delay sending it  LETTER XXXIII  Evelina in continuation  Oct  HOW agitated my dear Sir is the present life of your Evelina every day seems important and one event only a prelude to another  Mrs Selwyn upon her return this morning from the Hotwell entering my room very abruptly  said  "O my dear I have terrible news for you"  "For me Ma'amGood God what now"  "Arm yourself"  cried she  "with all your Berry Hill philosophycon over every lesson of fortitude or resignation you ever learnt in your lifefor knowyou are next week to be married to Lord Orville"  Doubt astonishment and a kind of perturbation I cannot describe made this abrupt communication alarm me extremely and almost breathless I could only exclaim  "Good God Madam what do you tell me"  "You may well be frightened my dear"  said she ironically  "for really there is something mighty terrific in becoming at once the wife of the man you adoreand a Countess"  I entreated her to spare her raillery and tell me her real meaning She could not prevail with herself to grant the  first  request though she readily complied with the second  My poor father she said was still in the utmost uneasiness He entered upon his affairs with great openness and told her he was equally disturbed how to dispose either of the daughter he had discovered or the daughter he was now to give up the former he dreaded to trust himself with again beholding and the latter he knew not how to shock with the intelligence of her disgrace Mrs Selwyn then acquainted him with my situation in regard to Lord Orville this delighted him extremely and when he heard of his Lordship's eagerness he said he was himself of opinion the sooner the union took place the better and in return he informed her of the affair of Mr Macartney  "And after a very long  conversation  continued Mrs Selwyn  "we agreed that the most eligible scheme for all parties would be to have both the real and the fictitious daughter married without delay Therefore if either of you have any inclination to pull caps for the title of Miss Belmont you must do it with all speed as next week will take from both of you all pretensions to it"  "Next week"dear Madam what a strange planwithout my being consultedwithout applying to Mr Villarswithout even the concurrence of Lord Orville"  "As to consulting  you  my dear it was out of all question because you know young ladies hearts and hands are always to be given with reluctanceas to Mr Villars it is sufficient we know him for your friendand as for Lord Orville he is a party concerned"  "A party concernedyou amaze me"  "Why yes for as I found our consultation likely to redound to his advantage I persuaded Sir John to send for him"  "Send for himGood God"  "Yes and Sir John agreed I told the servant that if he could not hear of his Lordship in the house he might be pretty certain of encountering him in the arbourWhy do you colour my dearWell he was with us in a moment I introduced him to Sir John and we proceeded to business"  "I am very very sorry for itLord Orville must himself think this conduct strangely precipitate"  "No my dear you are mistaken Lord Orville has too much good sense Every thing was then discussed in a rational manner You are to be married privately tho' not secretly and then  go to one of his Lordship's country seats and poor little Miss Green and your brother who have no house of their own must go to one of Sir John's"  "But why my dear Madam why all this haste why may we not be allowed a little longer ti me"  "I could give you a thousand reasons"  answered she  "but that I am tolerably certain  two  or  three  will be more than you can controvert even with all the logic of genuine coquetry In the first place you doubtless wish to quit the house of Mrs Beaumontto whose then can you with such propriety remove as to Lord Orville's"  "Surely Madam"  cried I  "I am not more destitute now than when I thought myself an orphan"  "Your father my dear"  answered she  "is willing to save the little impostor as much of the mortification of her disgrace as it is in his power now if you immediately take her place according to your right as Miss Belmont why not all that either of you can do for her will prevent her being eternally stigmatized as the bantling of Dame Green washwoman and wet nurse of Berry Hill Dorsetshire Now such a genealogy will not be very flattering even to Mr Macartney who alldismal as he is you will find by no means wanting in pride and self consequence"  "For the universe"  interrupted I  "I would not be accessary to the degradation you mention but surely Madam I may return to Berry Hill"  "By no means"  said she  "for though compassion may make us wish to save the poor girl the confusion of an immediate and public fall yet justice demands you should appear henceforward  in no other light than that of Sir John Belmont's daughter Besides between friends I who know the world can see that half this prodigious delicacy for the little usurper is the mere result of selfinterest for while  her  affairs are husht up Sir John's you know are kept from being brought further to light Now the double marriage we have projected obviates all rational objections Sir John will give you immediately £ all settlements and so forth will be made for you in the name of Evelina BelmontMr Macartney will at the same time take poor Polly Greenand yet at first it will only be generally known that  a daughter of  Sir  John Belmont  's is married"  In this manner though she did not convince me yet the quickness of her arguments silenced and perplexed me I enquired however if I might not be permitted to again see my father or whether I must regard myself as banished his presence for ever  "My dear"  said she  "he does not know you he concludes that you have been brought up to detest him and therefore he is rather prepared to dread than to love you"  This answer made me very unhappy I wished most impatiently to remove his prejudice and endeavour by dutiful assiduity to engage his kindness yet knew not how to propose seeing him while conscious he wished to avoid me  This evening as soon as the company was engaged with cards Lord Orville exerted his utmost eloquence to reconcile me to this hasty plan but how was I startled when he told me that next  Tuesday  was the day appointed by my father to be the most important of my life  "Next Tuesday  repeated I quite out of breath  "Oh my Lord"  "My sweet Evelina"  said he  "the day which will make me the happiest of mortals would probably appear awful to you were it to be deferred a twelvemonth Mrs Selwyn has doubtless acquainted you with the many motives which independent of my eagerness require it to be speedy suffer therefore its acceleration and generously complete my felicity by endeavouring to suffer it without repugnance"  "Indeed my Lord I would not wilfully raise objections nor do I desire to appear insensible of the honour of your good opinionbut there is something in this plan so very hastyso unreasonably precipitatebesides I shall have no time to hear from Berry Hilland believe me my Lord I should be for ever miserable were I in an affair so important to act without the sanction of Mr Villars' advice"  He offered to wait on you himself but I told him I had rather write to you And then he proposed that instead of my immediately accompanying him to Lincolnshire we should first pass a month at  my native Berry Hill  This was indeed a grateful proposal to me and I listened to it with undisguised pleasure Andin short I was obliged to consent to a compromise in merely deferring the day till Thursday He readily undertook to engage my father's concurrence in this little delay and I besought him at the same time to make use of his influence to obtain me a second interview and to represent the deep concern I felt in being thus banished his sight  He would then have spoken of  settlements  but  I assured him I was almost ignorant even of the word  And now my dearest Sir what is your opinion of these hasty proceedings believe me I half regret the simple facility with which I have suffered myself to be hurried into compliance and should you start but the smallest objection I will yet insist upon being allowed more time  I must now write a concise account of the state of my affairs to Howard Grove and to Madame Duval  Adieu dearest and most honoured Sir every thing at present depends upon your single decision to which though I yield in trembling I yield implicitly  LETTER XXXIV  Evelina in continuation  October  YESTERDAY morning as soon as breakfast was over Lord Orville went to the Hotwells to wait upon my father with my double petition  Mrs Beaumont then in general terms proposed a walk in the garden Mrs Selwyn said she had letters to write but Lady Louisa arose to accompany her  I had some reason to imagine from the notice with which her Ladyship had honoured me during breakfast that her brother had acquainted her with my present situation and her behaviour now confirmed my conjecture for when I would have gone up stairs instead of suffering me as  usual to pass disregarded she called after me with an affected surprise  "Miss Anville don't you walk with us"  There seemed something so littleminded in this sudden change of conduct that from an involuntary emotion of contempt I thanked her with a coldness like her own and declined her offer Yet observing that she blushed extremely at my refusal and recollecting she was sister to Lord Orville my indignation subsided and upon Mrs Beaumont's repeating the invitation I accepted it  Our walk proved extremely dull Mrs Beaumont who never says much was more silent than usual Lady Louisa strove in vain to lay aside the restraint and distance she has hitherto preserved and as to me I was too conscious of the circumstances to which I owed their attention to feel either pride or pleasure from receiving it  Lord Orville was not long absent he joined us in the garden with a look of gaiety and goodhumour that revived us all  "You are just the party"  said he  "I wished to see together Will you Madam"  taking my hand  "allow me the honour of introducing you by your real name to two of my nearest relations Mrs Beaumont give me leave to present to you the daughter of Sir John Belmont a young lady who I am sure must long since have engaged your esteem and admiration tho' you were a stranger to her birth"  "My Lord"  said Mrs Beaumont graciously saluting me  "the young lady's rank in lifeyour Lordsh p's recommendationor her own merit would any one of them have been sufficient to have entitled her to my regard and I hope she has always met with that respect in my house which is so much her due though had I been  sooner made acquainted with her family I should doubtless have the better known how to have secured it"  "Miss Belmont"  said Lord Orville  "can receive no lustre from family whatever she may give to it Louisa you will I am sure be happy to make yourself an interest in the friendship of Miss Belmont whom I hope shortly"  kissing my hand and joining it with her Ladyship's  "to have the happiness of presenting to you by yet another name and by the most endearing of all titles"  I believe it would be difficult to say whose cheeks were at that moment of the deepest dye Lady Louisa's or my own for the conscious pride with which she has hitherto slighted me gave to her an embarrassment which equalled the confusion that an introduction so unexpected gave to me She saluted me however and with a faint smile said  "I shall esteem myself very happy to profit by the honour of Miss Belmont's acquaintance"  I only courtsied and we walked on but it was evident from the little surprise they expressed that they had been already informed of the state of the affair  We were soon after joined by more company and Lord Orville then in a low voice took an opportunity to tell me the success of his visit In the first place Thursday was agreed to and in the second my father he said was much concerned to hear of my uneasiness sent me his blessing and complied with my request of seeing him with the same readiness he should agree to any other I could make Lord Orville therefore settled that I should wait upon him in the evening  and at his particular request unaccompanied by Mrs Selwyn  This kind message and the prospect of so soon seeing him gave me sensations of mixed pleasure and pain which wholly occupied my mind till the time of my going to the Hotwells  Mrs Beaumont lent me her chariot and Lord Orville absolutely insisted upon attending me  "If you go alone"  said he  "Mrs Selwyn will certainly be offended but if you allow me to conduct you tho' she may give the freer scope to her raillery she cannot possibly be affronted and we had much better suffer her laughter than provoke her satire"  Indeed I must own I had no reason to regret being so accompanied for his conversation supported my spirits from drooping and made the ride seem so short that we actually stopt at my father's door ere I knew we had proceeded ten yards  He handed me from the carriage and conducted me to the parlour at the door of which I was met by Mr Macartney  "Ah my dear brother"  cried I  "how happy am I to see you here"  He bowed and thanked me Lord Orville then holding out his hand said  "Mr Macartney I hope we shall be better acquainted I promise myself much pleasure from cultivating your friendship  "Your Lordship does me but too much honour"  answered Mr Macartney  "But where"  cried I  "is my sister for so I must already call and always consider herI am afraid she avoids meyou must endeavour my dear brother to prepossess her in my favour and reconcile her to owning me"  "Oh Madam"  cried he  "you are all goodness and benevolence but at present I hope you will excuse her for I fear she has hardly fortitude sufficient to see you in a short time perhaps"  "In a  very  short time then"  said Lord Orville  "I hope you will yourself introduce her and that we shall have the pleasure of wishing you both joy allow me my Evelina to say  we  and permit me in your name as well as my own to entreat that the first guests we shall have the happiness of receiving may be Mr and Mrs MaMacartney"  A servant then came to beg I would walk up stairs  I besought Lord Orville to accompany me but he feared the displeasure of Sir John who had desired to see me alone He led me however to the head of the stairs and made the kindest efforts to give me courage but indeed he did not succeed for the interview appeared to me in all its terrors and left me no feeling but apprehension  The moment I reached the landingplace the drawingroom door was opened and my father with a voice of kindness called out  "My child is it you"  "Yes Sir"  cried I springing forward and kneeling at his feet  "it is your child if you will own her"  He knelt by my side and folding me in his arms  "own thee"  repeated he  "yes my poor girl and Heaven knows with what bitter contrition"  Then raising both himself and me he brought me into the drawingroom shut the door and took me to the window where looking at me with great earnestness  "Poor unhappy  Caroline"  cried he and to my inexpressible concern he burst into tears Need I tell you my dear Sir how mine flowed at the sight  I would again have embraced his knees but hurrying from me he flung himself upon a sopha and leaning his face on his arms seemed for some time absorbed in bitterness of grief  I ventured not to interrupt a sorrow I so much respected but waited in silence and at a distance till he recovered from its violence But then it seemed in a moment to give way to a kind of frantic fury for starting suddenly with a sternness which at once surprised and frightened me  "Child"  cried he  "hast thou yet sufficiently humbled thy fatherif thou hast be contented with this proof of my weakness and no longer force thyself into my presence"  Thunderstruck by a command so unexpected I stood still and speechless and doubted whether my own ears did not deceive me  "Oh go go"  cried he passionately  "in pityin compassionif thou valuest my senses leave meand for ever"  "I will I will"  cried I greatly terrified and I moved hastily towards the door yet stopping when I reached it and almost involuntarily dropping on my knees  "Vouchsafe"  cried I  "oh Sir vouchsafe but once to bless your daughter and her sight shall never more offend you"  "Alas"  cried he in a softened voice  "I am not worthy to bless theeI am not worthy to call thee daughterI am not worthy that the fair light of heaven should visit my eyesOh God that I could but call back the time ere thou wast bornor else bury its remembrance in eternal oblivion"  "Would to Heaven"  cried I  "that the sight of me were less terrible to you that instead of irritating I could soothe your sorrowsOh Sir how thankfully would I then prove my duty even at the hazard of my life"  "Are you so kind"  cried he gently  "come hither childrise Evelinaalas it is for  me  to kneel not youand I  would  kneelI would crawl upon the earthI would kiss the dustcould I by such submission obtain the forgiveness of the representative of the most injured of women"  "Oh Sir"  exclaimed I  "that you could but read my heartthat you could but see the filial tenderness and concern with which it overflows you would not then talk thusyou would not then banish me your presence and exclude me from your affection"  "Good God"  cried he  "is it then possible that you do not hate meCan the child of the wronged Caroline look atand not execrate me Wast thou not born to abhor and bred to curse me did not thy mother bequeath thee her blessing on condition that thou shouldst detest and avoid me"  "Oh no no no"  cried I  "think not so unkindly of her nor so hardly of me"  I then took from my pocketbook her last letter and pressing it to my lips with a trembling hand and still upon my knees I held it out to him  Hastily snatching it from me  "Great Heaven"  cried he  'tis her writingWhence comes thiswho gave it youwhy had I it not sooner"  I made no answer his vehemence intimidated me and I ventured not to move from the suppliant posture in which I had put myself  He went from me to the window where his eyes were for some time rivetted upon the direction of the letter though his hand shook so violently he could hardly hold it Then bringing it to me  "Open it"  cried he  "for I cannot"  I had myself hardly strength to obey him but when I had he took it back and walked hastily up and down the room as if dreading to read it At length turning to me  "Do you know"  cried he  "its contents"  "No Sir  answered I  "it has never been unsealed"  He then again went to the window and began reading Having hastily run it over he cast up his eyes with a look of desperation the letter fell from his hand and he exclaimed  "yes thou art saintedthou art blessedand I am cursed for ever"  He continued some time fixed in this melancholy position after which casting himself with violence upon the ground  "Oh wretch"  cried he  "unworthy life and light in what dungeon canst thou hide thy head"  I could restrain myself no longer I rose and went to him I did not dare to speak but with pity and concern unutterable I wept and hung over him  Soon after starting up he again seized the letter exclaiming  "Acknowledge thee Carolineyes with my heart's best blood would I acknowledge theeOh that thou couldst witness the agony of my soulTen thousand daggers could not have wounded me like this letter"  Then after again reading it  "Evelina"  he cried  "she charges me to receive theewilt thou in obedience to her will own for thy father the destroyer of thy mother"  What a dreadful question I shuddered but could not speak  "To clear her fame and receive her child"  continued he looking stedfastly at the letter  "are the conditions upon which she leaves me her forgiveness her fame I have already clearedand oh how willingly would I take her child to my bosomfold her to my heartcall upon her to mitigate my anguish and pour the balm of comfort on my wounds were I not conscious I deserve not to receive it and that all my affliction is the result of my own guilt"  It was in vain I attempted to speak horror and grief took from me all power of utterance  He then read aloud from the letter  "  Look not like thy unfortunate mother  Sweet soul with what bitterness of spirit hast thou writtenCome hither Evelina Gracious Heaven"  looking earnestly at me  "never was likeness more strikingthe eyethe facethe formOh my child my child"  Imagine Sirfor I can never describe my feelings when I saw him sink upon his knees before me  "Oh dear resemblance of thy murdered motherOh all that remains of the mostinjured of women behold thy father at thy feetbending thus lowly to implore you would not hate himOh then thou representative of my departed wife speak to me in her name and say that the remorse which tears my soul tortures me not in vain"  "Oh rise rise my beloved father"  cried I attempting to assist him  "I cannot bear to see you thusreverse not the law of nature  rise yourself and bless your kneeling daughter"  "May Heaven bless thee my child"  cried he  "for  I  dare not"  He then rose and embracing me most affectionately added  "I see I see that thou art all kindness softness and tenderness I need not have feared thee thou art all the fondest father could wish and I will try to frame my mind to less painful sensations at thy sight Perhaps the time may come when I may know the comfort of such a daughterat present I am only fit to be alone dreadful as are my reflections they ought merely to torment myselfAdieu my childbe not angryI cannot stay with theeoh Evelina thy countenance is a dagger to my heartjust so thy mother lookedjust so"  Tears and sighs seemed to choak himand waving his hand he would have left mebut clinging to him  "Oh Sir"  cried I  "will you so soon abandon meam I again an orphanoh my dear my longlost father leave me not I beseech you take pity on your child and rob her not of the parent she so fondly hoped would cherish her"  "You know not what you ask"  cried he  "the emotions which now rend my soul are more than my reason can endure suffer me then to leave youimpute it not to unkindness but think of me as well as thou canstLord Orville has behaved noblyI believe he will make thee happy"  Then again embracing me  "God bless thee my dear child"  cried he  "God bless thee my Evelinaendeavour to loveat least not to hate meand to make me an interest in thy filial bosom by thinking of me as thy father"  I could not speak I kissed his hands on my knees and then with yet more emotion he again blessed me and hurried out of the roomleaving me almost drowned in tears  Oh Sir all goodness as you are how much will you feel for your Evelina during a scene of such agitation I pray Heaven to accept the tribute of his remorse and restore him to tranquility  When I was sufficiently composed to return to the parlour I found Lord Orville waiting for me with the utmost anxietyand then a new scene of emotion though of a far different nature awaited me for I learnt by Mr Macartney that this noblest of men had insisted the solongsupposed Miss Belmont should be considered  indeed  as my sister and as the coheiress of my father though not in  law  in  justice  he says she ought ever to be treated as the daughter of Sir John Belmont  Oh Lord Orvilleit shall be the sole study of my happy life to express better than by words the sense I have of your exalted benevolence and greatness of mind  LETTER XXXV  Evelina in continuation  Clifton  Oct  THIS morning early I received the following letter from Sir Clement Willoughby  To Miss Anville  I HAVE this moment received intelligence that preparations are actually making for your marriage with Lord Orville  Imagine not that I write with the imbecile idea of rendering those preparations abortive No I am not so mad My sole view is to explain the motive of my conduct in a particular instance and to obviate the accusation of treachery which may be laid to my charge  My unguarded behaviour when I last saw you has probably already acquainted you that the letter I then saw you reading was written by myself For your further satisfaction let me have the honour of informing you thatt the one you had designed for Lord Orville had fallen into my hands  However I may have been urged on by a passion the most violent that ever warmed the heart of man I can by no means calmly submit to be stigmatised for an action seemingly so dishonourable and it is for this reason that I trouble you with my justification  Lord Orvillethe happy Orville whom you are so ready to blesshad made me believe he loved you notnay that he held you in contempt  Such were my thoughts of his sentiments of you when I got possession of the letter you meant to send him I pretend not to vindicate either the means I used to obtain it or the action of breaking the sealbut I was impelled by an impetuous  curiosity to discover the terms upon which you wrote to him  The letter however was wholly unintelligible to me and the perusal of it only added to my perplexity  A tame suspence I was not born to endure and I determined to clear my doubts at all hazards and events  I answered it therefore in Orville's name  The views which I am now going to acknowledge must infallibly incur your displeasureyet I scorn all palliation  Briefly thenI concealed your letter to prevent a discovery of your capacityand I wrote you an answer which I hoped would prevent your wishing for any other  I am well aware of everything which can be said upon this subject Lord Orville will possibly think himself ill usedbut I am extremely indifferent as to his opinion nor do I now write by way of offering any apology to him but merely to make known to yourself the reasons by which I have been governed  I intend to set off next week for the Continent Should his Lordship have any commands for me in the mean time I shall be glad to receive them I say not this by way of defianceI should blush to be suspected of so doing through an indirect channelbut simply that if you shew him this letter he may know I dare defend as well as excuse my conduct  CLEMENT WILLOUGHBY  What a strange letter how proud and how piqued does its writer appear To what alternate  meanness  and  rashness  do the passions lead when reason and selfdenial do not oppose them Sir  Clement is conscious he has acted dishonourably yet the same unbridled vehemence which urged him to gratify a blameable curiosity will sooner prompt him to risk his life than confess his misconduct The rudeness of his manner of writing to me springs from the same cause the proof he has received of my indifference to him has stung him to the soul and he has neither the delicacy nor forbearance to disguise his displeasure  I determined not to shew this letter to Lord Orville and thought it most prudent to let Sir Clement know I should not I therefore wrote the following note  To Sir Clement Willoughby  Sir  THE letter you have been pleased to address to me is so little calculated to afford Lord Orville any satisfaction that you may depend upon my carefully keeping it from his sight I will bear you no resentment for what is past but I most earnestly entreat nay implore that you will not write again while in your present frame of mind by  any  channel direct or indirect  I hope you will have much pleasure in your purposed expedition and I beg leave to assure you of my good wishes  Not knowing by what name to sign I was obliged to send it without any  The  preparations  which Sir Clement mentions go on just as if your consent were arrived it is in  vain that I expostulate Lord Orville says should any objections be raised all shall be given up but that as his hopes forbid him to expect any he must proceed as if already assured of your concurrence  We have had this afternoon a most interesting conversation in which we have traced our sentiments of each other from our first acquaintance I have made him confess how ill he thought of me upon my foolish giddiness at Mrs Stanley's ball but he flatters me with assurances that every succeeding time he saw me I appeared to something less and less disadvantage  When I expressed my amazement that he could honour with his choice a girl who seemed so infinitely in  every  respect beneath his alliance he frankly owned that he had fully intended making more minute enquiries into my family and connections and particularly concerning  those people  he saw with me at Marybone before he acknowledged his prepossession in my favour but the suddenness of my intended journey and the uncertainty of seeing me again put him quite off his guard and  "divesting him of prudence left him nothing but love"  These were his words and yet he has repeatedly assured me that his partiality has known no bounds from the time of my residing at Clifton  Mr Macartney has just been with me on an embassy from my father He has sent me his kindest love and assurances of favour and desired to know if I am happy in the prospect of changing my situation and if there is any thing I can  name which he can do for me And at the same time Mr Macartney delivered to me a draught on my father's banker for a thousand pounds which he insisted that I should receive entirely for my own use and expend in equipping myself properly for the new rank of life to which I seem destined  I am sure I need not say how much I was penetrated by this goodness I wrote my thanks and acknowledged frankly that if I could see  him  restored to tranquility my heart would be without a wish  LETTER XXXVI  Evelina in continuation  Clifton  October  THE time approaches now when I hope we shall meetyet I cannot sleepgreat joy is as restless as sorrowand therefore I will continue my journal  As I had never had any opportunity of seeing Bath a party was formed last night for shewing me that celebrated city and this morning after breakfast we set out in three phaetons Lady Louisa and Mrs Beaumont with Lord Merton Mr Coverly with Mr Lovel and Mrs Selwyn and myself with Lord Orville  We had hardly proceeded half a mile when a gentleman in a postchaise which came galloping after us called out to the servants  "Holla my Ladspray is one Miss Anville in any of them  thingembobs  "  I immediately recollected the voice of Captain Mirvan and Lord Orville stopt the phaeton He was out of the chaise and with us in a moment  "So Miss Anville"  cried he  "how do you do So I hear you're Miss Belmont nowpray how does old Madame French do"  "Madame Duval"  said I  "is I believe very well"  "I hope she's in  good case  "  said he winking significantly  "and won't flinch at seeing service she has laid by long enough to refit and be made tight And pray how does poor Monsieur Doleful do is he as lankjawed as ever"  "They are neither of them"  said I  "at Bristol"  "NoBut surely the old dowager intends coming to the wedding 'twill be a most excellent opportunity to shew off her best Lyons' silk Besides I purpose to dance a newfashioned jig with her Don't you know when she'll come"  "I have no reason Sir to expect her at all"  "No'Fore George this here's the worst news I'd wish to hearwhy I've thought of nothing all the way but what trick I should serve her"  "You have been very obliging"  said I laughing  "O I promise you"  cried he  "our Moll would never have wheedled me into this jaunt if I'd known she was not here for to let you into the secret I fully intended to have treated the old buck with another frolic"  "Did Miss Mirvan then persuade you to this journey"  "Yes and we've been travelling all night"  "  We  "  cried I"  "Is Miss Mirvan then with you"  "What Mollyyes she's in that there chaise"  "Good God Sir why did not you tell me sooner"  cried I and immediately with Lord Orville's assistance I jumpt out of the phaeton and ran to the dear girl Lord Orville opened the chaisedoor and I am sure I need not tell you what unfeigned joy accompanied our meeting  We both begged we might not be parted during the ride and Lord Orville was so good as to invite Captain Mirvan into his phaeton  I think I was hardly ever more rejoiced than at this so seasonable visit from my dear Maria who had no sooner heard the situation of my affairs than with the assistance of Lady Howard and her kind mother she besought her father with such earnestness to consent to the journey that he had not been able to withstand their united entreaties though she owned that had he not expected to have met with Madame Duval she believes he would not so readily have yielded They arrived at Mrs Beaumont's but a few minutes after we were out of sight and overtook us without much difficulty  I say nothing of our conversation because you may so well suppose both the subjects we chose and our manner of discussing them  We all stopped at a great hotel where we were obliged to enquire for a room as Lady Louisa  fatigued to death  desired to  take something  before we began our rambles  As soon as the party was assembled the Captain abruptly saluting me said  "So Miss Belmont I wish you joy so I hear you've quarrelled with your new name already"  "Meno indeed Sir"  "Then please for to tell me the reason you're in such a hurry to change it"  "Miss Belmont"  cried Mr Lovel looking round him with the utmost astonishment  "I beg pardonbut if it is not impertinentI must beg leave to say I always understood that Lady's name was Anville"  "'Fore George"  cried the Captain  "it runs in my head I've seen you somewhere before and now I think on't pray a'n't you the person I saw at the play one night and who did n't know all the time whether it was a tragedy or a comedy or a concert of fidlers"  "I believe Sir"  said Mr Lovel stammering  "I had onceI thinkthe pleasure of seeing you last spring"  "Ay and if I live an hundred springs"  answered he  "I shall never forget it by Jingo it has served me for a most excellent good joke ever since Well however I'm glad to see you still in the land of the living"  shaking him roughly by the hand  "pray if a body may be so bold how much a night may you give at present to keep the undertakers aloof"  "Me Sir"  said Mr Lovel very much discomposed  "I protest I never thought myself in such imminent danger as toreally Sir I don't understand you"  "O you don'twhy then I'll make free for to explain myself Gentlemen and Ladies I'll tell you what do you know this here gentleman simple as he sits there pays five shillings a night to let his friends know he's alive  "And very cheap too"  said Mrs Selwyn  "if we consider the value of the intelligence"  Lady Louisa being now refreshed we proceeded upon our expedition  The charming city of Bath answered all my expectations The Crescent the prospect from it and the elegant symmetry of the Circus delighted me The Parades I own rather disappointed me one of them is scarce preferable to some of the best paved streets in London and the other though it affords a beautiful prospect a charming view of Prior Park and of the Avon yet wanted something in  itself  of more striking elegance than a mere broad pavement to satisfy the ideas I had formed of it  At the pumproom I was amazed at the public exhibition of the ladies in the bath it is true their heads are covered with bonnets but the very idea of being seen in such a situation by whoever pleases to look is indelicate  "'Fore George"  said the Captain looking into the bath  "this would be a most excellent place for old Madame French to dance a fandango in By Jingo I would n't wish for better sport than to swing her round this here pond"  "She would be very much obliged to you"  said Lord Orville  "for so extraordinary a mark of your favour"  "Why to let you know"  answered the Captain  "she hit my fancy mightily I never took so much to an old tabby before"  "Really now"  cried Mr Lovel looking also into the bath  "I must confess it is to me very incomprehensible why the ladies chuse that frightful unbecoming dress to bathe in I have often pondered very seriously upon the subject but could never hit upon the reason"  "Well I declare"  said Lady Louisa  "I should like of all things to set something new a going I always hated bathing because one can get no pretty dress for it now do there's a good creature try to help me to something"  "Who meO dear Ma'am"  said he simpering  "I can't pretend to assist a person of your Ladyship's taste besides I have not the least head for fashionsI really don't think I ever invented three in my lifebut I never had the least turn for dressnever any notion of fancy or elegance"  "O fie Mr Lovel how can you talk sodon't we all know that you lead the  ton  in the  beau monde  I declare I think you dress better than any body"  "O dear Ma'am you confuse me to the last degree  I  dress wellI protest I don't think I'm ever fit to be seenI'm often shocked to death to think what a figure I go If your Ladyship will believe me I was full half an hour this morning thinking what I should put on"  "Odds my life"  cried the Captain  "I wish I'd been near you I warrant I'd have quickened  your motions a little Half an hour thinking what you'd put on and who the deuce do you think cares the snuff of a candle whether you've any thing on or not"  "O pray Captain"  cried Mrs Selwyn  "don't be angry with the gentleman for  thinking  whatever be the cause for I assure you he makes no common practice of offending in that way"  "Really Ma'am you are prodigiously kind"  said Mr Lovel angrily  "Pray now"  said the Captain  "did you ever get a ducking in that there place yourself"  "A ducking Sir"  repeated Mr Lovel  "I protest I think that's rather an odd termbut if you mean a  bathing  it is an honour I have had many times"  "And pray if a body may be so bold what do you do with that frizlefrize top of your own Why I'll lay you what you will there is fat and grease enough on your crown to buoy you up if you were to go in head downwards"  "And I don't know"  cried Mrs Selwyn  "but that might be the easiest way for I'm sure it would be the lightest"  "For the matter of that there"  said the Captain  "you must make him a soldier before you can tell which is the lightest head or heels Howsomever I'd lay ten pounds to a shilling I could whisk him so dexterously over into the pool that he should light plump upon his foretop and turn round like a tetotum"  "Done"  cried Lord Merton  "I take your odds"  "Will you"  returned he  "why then 'fore George I'd do it as soon as say Jack Robinson"  "He he"  faintly laughed Mr Lovel as he moved abruptly from the window  "'pon honour this is pleasant enough but I don't see what right any body has to lay wagers about one without one's consent"  "There Lovel you are out"  cried Mr Coverly  "any man may lay what wager about you he pleases your consent is nothing to the purpose he may lay that your nose is a skyblue if he pleases"  "Ay"  said Mrs Selwyn  "or that your mind is more adorned than your personor any absurdity whatsoever"  "I protest"  said Mr Lovel angrily  "I think it's a very disagreeable privilege and I must beg that nobody may take such a liberty with  me  "  "Like enough you may"  cried the Captain  "but what's that to the purpose suppose I've a mind to lay that you've never a tooth in your headpray how will you hinder me"  "You'll allow me at least Sir to take the liberty of asking how you'll  prove  it"  "Howwhy by knocking them all down your throat"  "Knocking them all down my throat Sir"  repeated Mr Lovel with a look of horror  "I protest I never heard any thing so shocking in my life and I must beg leave to observe that no wager in my opinion could justify such a barbarous action"  Here Lord Orville interfered and hurried us to our carriages  We returned in the same order we cameMrs Beaumont invited all the party to dinner and has been so obliging as to beg Miss Mirvan may continue at her house during her stay The Captain will lodge at the Wells  The first halfhour after our return was devoted to hearing Mr Lovel's apologies for dining in his ridingdress  Mrs Beaumont then addressing herself to Miss Mirvan and me enquired how we liked Bath  "I hope"  said Mr Lovel  "the Ladies do not call this seeing Bath"  "Nowhat should ail 'em"  cried the Captain  "do you suppose they put their eyes in their pockets"  "No Sir but I fancy you will find no personthat is no person of any conditioncall going about a few places in a morning  seeing Bath  "  "Mayhap then"  said the literal Captain  "you think we should see it better by going about at midnight'  "No Sir no"  said Mr Lovel with a supercilious smile  "I perceive you don't understand me  we  should never call it  seeing Bath  without going at the right season"  "Why what a plague then"  demanded he  "can you only see at one season of the year"  Mr Lovel again smiled but seemed superior to making any answer  "The Bath amusements"  said Lord Orville  "have a sameness in them which after a short time renders them rather insipid but the greatest objection that can be made to the place is the encouragement it gives to gamesters"  "Why I hope my Lord you would not think of abolishing  gaming  "  cried Lord Merton  "'tis the very  zest  of life Devil take me if I could live without it"  "I am sorry for it"  said Lord Orville gravely and looking at Lady Louisa  "Your Lordship is no judge of this subject"  continued the other  "but if once we could get you to a gamingtable you'd never be happy away from it"  "I hope my Lord"  cried Lady Louisa  "that nobody  here  ever occasions  your  quitting it"  "Your Ladyship"  said Lord Merton recollecting himself  "has power to make me quit any thing"  "Except  herself  "  said Mr Coverley  "Egad my Lord I think I've helpt you out there"  "You men of wit Jack"  answered his Lordship  "are always readyfor my part I don't pretend to any talents that way"  "Really my Lord"  asked the sarcastic Mrs Selwyn  "well that is wonderful considering success would be so much in your power"  "Pray Madam"  said Mr Lovel to Lady Louisa  "has your Ladyship heard the news"  "Newswhat news"  "Why the report circulating at the Wells concerning a certain person"  "O Lord no pray tell me what it is"  "O no Ma'am I beg your La'ship will excuse me 'tis a profound secret and I would not have mentioned it if I had not thought you knew it"  "Lord now how can you be so monstrousI declare now you're a provoking creature  But come I know you'll tell mewon't you now"  "Your La'ship knows I am but too happy to obey you but 'pon honour I can't speak a word if you won't all promise me the most inviolable secrecy"  "I wish you'd wait for that from me"  said the Captain  "and I'll give you my word you'd be dumb for one while Secrecy quoth aFore George I wonder you a'n't ashamed to mention such a word when you talk of telling it to a woman Though for the matter of that I'd as lieve blab it to the whole sex at once as to go for to tell it to such a thing as you"  "Such a thing as me Sir"  said Mr Lovel letting fall his knife and fork and looking very important  "I really have not the honour to understand your expression"  "It's all one for that"  said the Captain  "you may have it explained whenever you like it"  "'Pon honour Sir"  returned Mr Lovel  "I must take the liberty to tell you that I should be extremely offended but that I suppose it to be some seaphrase and therefore I'll let it pass without further notice"  Lord Orville then to change the discourse asked Miss Mirvan if she should spend the ensuing winter in London"  "No to be sure"  said the Captain  "what should she for she saw all that was to be seen before"  "Is London then"  said Mr Lovel smiling at Lady Louisa  "only to be regarded as a  sight  "  "Why pray Mr Wiseacre how are you pleased for to regard it yourselfAnswer me to that"  "O Sir  my  opinion I fancy you would hardly find intelligible I don't understand  seaphrases  enough to define it to your comprehension Does n't your La'ship think the task would be rather difficult"  "O Lard yes"  cried Lady Louisa  "I declare I'd as soon teach my parrot to talk Welch"  "Ha ha ha admirablePon honour your La'ship's quite in luck to daybut that indeed your La'ship is every day Though to be sure it is but candid to acknowledge that the gentlemen of the ocean have a set of ideas as well as a dialect so opposite to  ours  that it is by no means surprising  they  should regard London as a mere  show  that may be seen by being  looked at  Ha ha ha  "Ha ha  echoed Lady Louisa  Well I declare you are the drollest creature"  "He he 'pon honour I can't help laughing at the conceit of  seeing London  in a few weeks"  "And what a plague should hinder you"  cried the Captain  "do you want to spend a day in every street"  Here again Lady Louisa and Mr Lovel interchanged smiles  "Why I warrant you if I had the shewing of it I'd haul you from St James's to Wapping the very first morning"  The smiles were now with added contempt repeated which the Captain observing looked very fiercely at Mr Lovel and said  "Hark'ee my spark none of your grinning'tis a lingo I don't understand and if you give me any more of it I shall go near to lend you a box o' the ear"  "I protest Sir"  said Mr Lovel turning extremely pale  "I think it's taking a very particular  liberty with a person to talk to one in such a style as this"  "It's like you may"  returned the Captain  "but give a good gulp and I warrant you'll swallow it"  Then calling for a glass of ale with a very provoking and significant nod he drank to his easy digestion  Mr Lovel made no answer but looked extremely sullen and soon after we left the gentlemen to themselves  I had then two letters delivered to me one from Lady Howard and Mrs Mirvan which contained the kindest congratulations and the other from Madame Duvalbut not a word from  you  to my no small surprise and concern  Madame Duval seems greatly rejoiced at my late intelligence a violent cold she says prevented her coming to Bristol The Branghtons she tells me are all well Miss Polly is soon to be married to Mr Brown but Mr Smith has changed his lodgings  "which"  she adds  "has made the house extremely dull However that's not the worse news  pardie  I wish it was but I've been used like nobodyfor Monsieur Du Bois has had the baseness to go back to France without me"  In conclusion she assures me as you prognosticated she would that I shall be sole heiress of all she is worth when Lady Orville  At teatime we were joined by all the gentlemen but Captain Mirvan who went to the Hotel where he was to sleep and made his daughter accompany him to separate her  trumpery  as he called it from his cloaths  As soon as they were gone Mr Lovel who still appeared extremely sulky said  "I protest I never saw such a vulgar abusive fellow in my life as that Captain 'pon honour I believe he  came here for no purpose in the world but to pick a quarrel however for my part I vow I won't humour him"  "I declare"  cried Lady Louisa  "he put me in a monstrous frightI never heard any body talk so shocking in my life"  "I think"  said Mrs Selwyn with great solemnity  "he threatened to box your ears Mr Loveldid not he"  "Really Ma'am"  said Mr Lovel colouring  "if one was to mind every thing those low kind of people sayone should never be at rest for one impertinence or otherso I think the best way is to be above taking any notice of them"  "What"  said Mrs Selwyn with the same gravity  "and so receive the blow in silence"  During this discourse I saw the Captain's chaise drive up to the gate and ran down stairs to meet Maria She was alone and told me that her father who she was sure had some scheme in agitation against Mr Lovel had sent her on before him We continued in the garden till his return and were joined by Lord Orville who begged me not to insist on a patience so unnatural as submitting to be excluded our society And let me my dear Sir with a grateful heart let me own I never before passed half an hour in such perfect felicity  I believe we were all sorry when we saw the Captain return yet his inward satisfaction from however different a cause did not seem inferior to what ours had been He chucked Maria under the chin rubbed his hands and was scarce able to contain the fullness of his glee We all attended him to the drawingroom where having composed his countenance without any previous  attention to Mrs Beaumont he marched up to Mr Lovel and abruptly said  "Pray have you ever a brother in these here parts"  "Me Sirno thank Heaven I'm free from all incumbrances of that sort"  "Well"  cried the Captain  "I met a person just now so like you I could have sworn he had been your twinbrother"  "It would have been a most singular pleasure to me"  said Mr Lovel  "if I also could have seen him for really I have not the least notion what sort of a person I am and I have a prodigious curiosity to know"  Just then the Captain's servant opening the door said  "A little gentleman below desires to see one Mr Lovel"  "Beg him to walk up stairs"  said Mrs Beaumont  "But pray what is the reason William is out of the way"  The man shut the door without any answer  "I can't imagine who it is"  said Mr Lovel  "I recollect no little Gentleman of my acquaintance now at Bristolexcept indeed the Marquis of Carltonbut I don't much fancy it can be him Let me see who else is there so very little"  A confused noise among the servants now drew all eyes towards the door the impatient Captain hastened to open it and then clapping his hands called out  "'Fore George 'tis the same person I took for your relation"  And then to the utter astonishment of every body but himself he hauled into the room a monkey full dressed and extravagantly  àlamode  The dismay of the company was almost general Poor Mr Lovel seemed thunderstruck with  indignation and surprise Lady Louisa began a scream which for some time was incessant Miss Mirvan and I jumped involuntarily upon the seats of our chairs Mrs Beaumont herself followed our example Lord Orville placed himself before me as a guard and Mrs Selwyn Lord Merton and Mr Coverley burst into a loud immoderate ungovernable fit of laughter in which they were joined by the Captain till unable to support himself he rolled on the floor  The first voice which made its way thro' this general noise was that of Lady Louisa which her fright and screaming rendered extremely shrill  "Take it away"  cried she  "take the monster awayI shall faint I shall faint if you don't"  Mr Lovel irritated beyond endurance angrily demanded of the Captain what he meant"  "Mean"  cried the Captain as soon as he was able to speak  "why only to shew you in your proper colours"  Then rising and pointing to the monkey  "Why now Ladies and Gentlemen I'll be judged by youDid you ever see any thing more like Odds my life if it was n't for this here tail you would n't know one from t'other"  "Sir"  cried Mr Lovel stamping  "I shall take a time to make you feel my wrath"  "Come now"  continued the regardless Captain  "just for the fun's sake doff your coat and waistcoat and swop with Monsieur  Grinagain  here and I'll warrant you'll not know yourself which is which"  "Not know myself from a monkeyI assure you Sir I'm not to be used in this manner and I won't bear itcurse me if I will"  "Why heyday"  cried the Captain  "what is Master in a passionwell don't be angrycome he shan't hurt youhere shake a paw with himwhy he'll do you no harm mancome kiss and friends"  "Who I"  cried Mr Lovel almost mad with vexation  "as I'm a living creature I would not touch him for a thousand worlds"  "Send him a challenge"  cried Mr Coverley  "and I'll be your second"  "Ay do"  said the Captain  "and I'll be second to my friend Monsieur Clapperclaw here Come to it at oncetooth and nail"  "God forbid"  cried Mr Lovel retreating  "I would sooner trust my person with a mad bull"  "I don't like the looks of him myself"  said Lord Merton  "for he grins most horribly"  "Oh I'm frightened out of my senses"  cried Lady Louisa  "take him away or I shall die"  "Captain"  said Lord Orville  "the ladies are alarmed and I must beg you would send the monkey away"  "Why where can be the mighty harm of one monkey more than another"  answered the Captain  howsomever if it's agreeable to the ladies suppose we turn them out together"  "What do you mean by that Sir"  cried Mr Lovel lifting up his cane  "What do  you  mean"  cried the Captain fiercely  be so good as to down with your cane"  Poor Mr Lovel too much intimidated to stand his ground yet too much enraged to submit turned hastily round and forgetful of consequences vented his passion by giving a furious blow to the monkey  The creature darting forwards sprung instantly upon him and olinging round his neck fastened his teeth to one of his ears  I was really sorry for the poor man who though an egregious fop had committed no offence that merited such chastisement  It was impossible now to distinguish whose screams were loudest those of Mr Lovel or the terrified Lady Louisa who I believe thought her own turn was approaching but the unrelenting Captain roared with joy  Not so Lord Orville ever humane generous and benevolent he quitted his charge whom he saw was wholly out of danger and seizing the monkey by the collar made him loosen the ear and then with a sudden swing flung him out of the room and shut the door  Mr Lovel was now a dreadful object his face was besmeared with tears the blood from his ear ran trickling down his cloaths and he sunk upon the floor crying out  "Oh I shall die I shall dieOh I'm bit to death"  "Captain Mirvan"  said Mrs Beaumont with no little indignation  "I must own I don't perceive the wit of this action and I am sorry to have such cruelty practised in my house"  "Why Lord Ma'am"  said the Captain when his rapture abated sufficiently for speech  "how could I tell they'd fall out soby Jingo I brought him to be a messmate for t'other"  "Egad"  said Mr Coverley  "I would not have been served so for a thousand pounds"  "Why then there's the odds on't"  said the Captain  "for you see he is served so for nothing But come"  turning to Mr Lovel  "be of good heart all may end well yet and you and Monsieur Longtail be as good friends as ever"  "I'm surprised Mrs Beaumont"  cried Mr Lovel starting up  "that you can suffer a person under your roof to be treated so inhumanly"  "What argufies so many words"  said the  unfeeling Captain  "it is but a slit of the ear it only looks as if you had been in the pillory"  "Very true"  added Mrs Selwyn  and who knows but it may acquire you the credit of being an antiministerial writer"  "I protest"  cried Mr Lovel looking ruefully at his dress  "my new ridingsuit's all over blood"  "Ha ha ha"  cried the captain  "see what comes of studying for an hour what you shall put on"  Mr Lovel then walked to the glass and looking at the place exclaimed  "Oh Heaven what a monstrous wound my ear will never be fit to be seen again"  "Why then"  said the Captain  "you must hide it'tis but wearing a wig"  "A wig"  repeated the affrighted Mr Lovel  "  I  wear a wigno not if you would give me a thousand pounds an hour"  "I declare"  said Lady Louisa  "I never heard such a shocking proposal in my life"  "Lord Orville then seeing no prospect that the altercation would cease proposed to the Captain to walk He assented and having given Mr Lovel a nod of exultation accompanied his Lordship down stairs  "'Pon honour"  said Mr Lovel the moment the door was shut  "that fellow is the greatest brute in nature he ought not to be admitted into a civilized society"  "Lovel"  said Mr Coverley affecting to whisper  "you must certainly pink him you must not put up with such an affront"  "Sir"  said Mr Lovel  "with any common person I should not deliberate an instant but really with a fellow who has done nothing but fight all his life 'pon honour Sir I can't think of it"  "Lovel"  said Lord Merton in the same voice  "you  must  call him to account"  "Every man"  said he pettishly  "is the best judge of his own affairs and I don't ask the honour of any person's advice"  "Egad Lovel"  said Mr Coverley  "you're in for ityou can't possibly be off"  "Sir"  cried he very impatiently  "upon any proper occasion I should be as ready to shew my courage as any bodybut as to fighting for such a trifle as thisI protest I should blush to think of it"  "A trifle"  cried Mrs Selwyn  "good Heaven and have you made this astonishing riot about a  trifle  "  "Ma'am"  answered the poor wretch in great confusion  "I did not know at first but that my cheek might have been bitbut as 'tis no worse why it does not a great deal signify Mrs Beaumont I have the honour to wish you a good evening I'm sure my carriage must be waiting"  And then very abruptly he left the room  What a commotion has this mischiefloving Captain raised Were I to remain here long even the society of my dear Maria could scarce compensate for the disturbances he excites  When he returned and heard of his quiet exit his triumph was intolerable  "I think I think"  cried he  "I have peppered him well I'll warrant he won't give an hour tomorrow morning to settling what he shall put on why his coat"  turning to me  "would be a most excellent match for old Madame Furbelow's best Lyons' silk 'Fore George I'd desire no better sport than to have that there old cat here to go her snacks"  All the company then Lord Orville Miss Mirvan and myself excepted played at cards and  we  oh how much better did we pass our time"  While we were engaged in a most delightful conversation a servant brought me a letter which  he told me had by some accident been mislaid Judge my feelings when I saw my dearest Sir your revered handwriting My emotions soon betrayed to Lord Orville whom the letter was from the importance of the contents he well knew and assuring me I should not be seen by the cardplayers he besought me to open it without delay  Open it indeed I didbut read it I could notthe willing yet aweful consent you have grantedthe tenderness of your expressionsthe certainty that no obstacle remained to my eternal union with the loved owner of my heart gave me sensations too various and though joyful too little placid for observation Finding myself unable to proceed and blinded by the tears of gratitude and delight which started into my eyes I gave over the attempt of reading till I retired to my own room and having no voice to answer the enquiries of Lord Orville I put the letter into his hands and left it to speak both for me and itself  Lord Orville was himself affected by your kindness he kissed the letter as he returned it and pressing my hand affectionately to his heart  "You are now"  said he in a low voice  "all my own Oh my Evelina how will my soul find room for its happinessit seems already bursting"  I could make no reply indeed I hardly spoke another word the rest of the evening so little talkative is the fullness of contentment  O my dearest Sir the thankfulness of my heart I must pourforth at our meeting when at your feet my happiness receives its confirmation from your blessing and when my nobleminded my beloved Lord Orville presents to you the highlyhonoured and thricehappy Evelina  A few lines I will endeavour to write on Thursday  which shall be sent off express to give you should nothing intervene yet more certain assurance of our meeting  Now then therefore for the firstand probably the last time I shall ever own the name permit me to sign myself  Most dear Sir  Your gratefully affectionate EVELINA BELMONT  Lady Louisa at her own particular desire will be present at the ceremony as well as Miss Mirvan and Mrs Selwyn Mr Macartney will the same morning unite himself with my fostersister and my father himself will give us both away  LETTER XXXVII  Mr Villars to Evelina  EVERY wish of my soul is now fulfilledfor the felicity of my Evelina is equal to her worthiness  Yes my child thy happiness is engraved in golden characters upon the tablets of my heart and their impression is indelible for should the rude and deepsearching hand of Misfortune attempt to pluck them from their repository the fleeting fabric of life would give way and in tearing from my vitals the nourishment by which they are supported she would but grasp at a shadow insensible to her touch  Give thee my consentOh thou joy comfort and pride of my life how cold is that word to express the fervency of my approbation yes I do indeed give thee my consent and so thankfully that with the humblest gratitude to Providence I would seal it with the remnant of my days  Hasten then my love to bless me with thy presence and to receive the blessings with which my fond heart overflowsAnd oh my Evelina hear and assist in one only humble but ardent prayer which yet animates my devotions that the height of bliss to which thou art rising may not render thee giddy but that the purity of thy mind may form the brightest splendor of thy prosperityand that the weak and aged frame of thy almost idolizing parent nearly worn out by time past afflictions and infirmities may yet be able to sustain a meeting with all its better part holds dear and then that all the wounds which the former severity of fortune inflicted may be healed and purified by the ultimate consolation of pouring forth my dying words in blessings on my childclosing these joystreaming eyes in her presence and breathing my last faint sighs in her loved arms  Grieve not oh child of my care grieve not at the inevitable moment but may thy own end be equally propitious Oh may'st thou when full of days and full of honour sink down as gently to restbe loved as kindly watched as tenderly as thy happy father And may'st thou when thy glass is run be sweetly but not bitterly mourned by some remaining darling of thy affectionssome yet surviving Evelina  ARTHUR VILLARS  LETTER XXXVIII  Evelina to the Rev Mr Villars  ALL is over my dearest Sir and the fate of your Evelina is decided This morning with fearful joy and trembling gratitude she united herself for ever with the object of her dearest her eternal affection  I have time for no more the chaise now waits which is to conduct me to dear Berry Hill and to the arms of the best of men  EVELINA  FINIS
