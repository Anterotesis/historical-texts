 CLARISSA OR THE HISTORY OF A YOUNG LADY Comprehending The most  Important Concerns  of  Private LIFE  And particularly shewing The DISTRESSES that may attend the Misconduct Both of PARENTS and CHILDREN In Relation to MARRIAGE Published by the  EDITOR  of  PAMELA  VOL I  LONDON Printed for S Richardson And Sold by A MILLAR overagainst  Catharinestreet  in the  Strand  J and JA RIVINGTON in  St Paul's Churchyard  JOHN OSBORN in  Paternoster Row  And by J LEAKE at  Bath    MDCCXLVIII  PREFACE  _THE following History is given in a Series of Letters written principally in a double yet separate Correspondence  Between Two young Ladies of Virtue and Honour bearing an inviolable Friendship for each other and writing upon the most interesting Subjects And  Between Two Gentlemen of free Lives one of them glorying in his Talents for Stratagem and Invention and communicating to the other in Confidence all the secret Purposes of an intriguing Head and resolute Heart  But it is not amiss to premise for the sake of such as may apprehend Hurt to the Morals of Youth from the more freelywritten  Letters That the Gentlemen tho' professed Libertines as to the Fair Sex and making it one of their wicked Maxims to keep no Faith with any of the Individuals of it who throw themselves into their Power are not however either Infidels or Scoffers Nor yet such as think themselves freed from the Observance of other moral Obligations  On the contrary it will be found in the Progress of the Collection that they very often make such Reflections upon each other and each upon himself and upon his Actions as reasonable Beings who disbelieve not a future State of Rewards and Punishments and who one day propose to reform must sometimes makeOne of them actually reforming and antidoting the Poison which some might otherwise apprehend would be spread by the gayer Pen and lighter Heart of the other  And yet that other altho' in unbosoming himself to a  select Friend  he discover Wickedness enough to intitle him to general Hatred preserves a Decency as well in his Images as in his Language which is not always to be found in the Works of some of the most celebrated modern Writers whose Subjects and Characters have less warranted the Liberties they have taken  Length will be naturally expected not only  from what has been said but from the following Considerations  That the Letters on both Sides are written while the Hearts of the Writers must be supposed to be wholly engaged in their Subjects The Events at the Time generally dubiousSo that they abound not only with critical Situations but with what may be called  instantaneous  Descriptions and Reflections which may be brought home to the Breast of the youthful ReaderAs also with affecting Conversations many of them written in the Dialogue or Dramatic Way  To which may be added that the Collection contains not only the History of the excellent Person whose Name it bears but includes The Lives Characters and Catastrophes of several others either principally or incidentally concerned in the Story  But yet the Editor to whom it was referred to publish the Whole in such a Way as he should think would be most acceptable to the Public was so diffident in relation to this Article of  Length  that he thought proper to submit the Letters to the Perusal of several judicious Friends whose Opinion he desired of what might be best spared  One Gentleman in particular of whose Knowlege  Judgment and Experience as well as Candor the Editor has the highest Opinion advised him to give a Narrative Turn to the Letters and to publish only what concerned the principal Heroinestriking off the collateral Incidents and all that related to the Second Characters tho' he allowed the Parts which would have been by this means excluded to be both instructive and entertaining But being extremely fond of the affecting Story he was desirous to have everything parted with which he thought retarded its Progress  This Advice was not relished by other Gentlemen They insisted that the Story could not be reduced to a Dramatic Unity nor thrown into the Narrative Way without divesting it of its Warmth and of a great Part of its Efficacy as very few of the Reflections and Observations which they looked upon as the most useful Part of the Collection would then find a Place  They were of Opinion That in all Works of This and of the Dramatic Kind STORY or AMUSEMENT should be considered as little more than the  Vehicle  to the more necessary INSTRUCTION That many of the Scenes would be render'd languid were they to be made less busy And that the Whole would be thereby deprived of that Variety which is deemed the Soul of a Feast whether  mensal  or  mental    They were also of Opinion That the Parts and Characters which must be omitted if this Advice were followed were some of the most natural in the whole Collection And no less instructive especially to  Youth  Which might be a Consideration perhaps overlooked by a Gentleman of the Adviser's great Knowlege and Experience For as they observed there is a Period in human Life in which youthful Activity ceasing and Hope contenting itself to look from its own domestic Wicket upon bounded Prospects the halftired Mind aims at little more than  Amusement  And with Reason for what in the  instructive  Way can appear either  new  or  needful  to one who has happily got over those dangerous Situations which call for Advice and Cautions and who has fill'd up his Measures of Knowlege to the Top  Others likewise gave  their  Opinions But no Two being of the same Mind as to the Parts which could be omitted it was resolved to present to the World the Two First Volumes by way of Specimen and to be determined with regard to the rest by the Reception those should meet with  If that be favourable Two others may soon follow the whole Collection being ready for the Press That is to say If it be not found necessary  to abstract or omit some of the Letters in order to reduce the Bulk of the Whole  Thus much in general But it may not be amiss to add in particular that in the great Variety of Subjects which this Collection contains it is one of the principal Views of the Publication  To caution Parents against the undue Exertion of their natural Authority over their Children in the great Article of Marriage  And Children against preferring a Man of Pleasure to a Man of Probity upon that dangerous but too commonly received Notion  That a Reformed Rake makes the best Husband    But as the Characters will not all appear in the Two First Volumes it has been thought advisable in order to give the Reader some further Idea of Them and of the Work to prefix  A brief Account of the principal Characters throughout the Whole  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE

Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER I Miss  ANNA HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Jan  _I AM extremely concerned my dearest friend for the disturbances that have happened in your family I know how it must hurt you to become the subject of the public talk And yet upon an occasion so generally known it is impossible but that whatever relates to a young lady whose distinguished merits have made her the public care should engage everybody's attention I long to have the particulars from yourself and of the usage I am told you receive upon an accident you could not help and in which as far as I can learn the sufferer was the aggressor  Mr Diggs  Her brother's surgeon  whom I sent for at the first hearing of the rencounter to inquire for  your  sake how your brother was told me That there was no danger from the wound if there were none from the fever which it seems has been increased by the perturbation of his spirits  Mr Wyerley drank tea with us yesterday and tho' he is far from being partial to Mr Lovelace as it may be well supposed yet both he and Mr Symmes blame your family for the treatment they gave him when he went in person to inquire after your brother's health and to express his concern for what had happened  They say That Mr Lovelace could not avoid drawing his sword And that either your brother's unskilfulness or violence left him from the very first pass intirely in his power This I am told was what Mr Lovelace said upon it retreating as he spoke  'Have a care Mr HarloweYour violence puts you out of your defence You give me too much advantage For your sister's sake I will pass by everythingif'  But this the more provoked his rashness to lay himself open to the advantage of his adversaryWho after a slight wound in the arm took away his sword  There are people who love not your brother because of his natural imperiousness and fierce and uncontroulable temper These say That the young gentleman's passion was abated on seeing his blood gush plentifully down his arm and that he received the generous offices of his adversary who help'd him off with his coat and waistcoat and bound up his arm till the surgeon could come with such patience as was far from making a visit afterwards from that adversary to inquire after his health appear either insulting or improper  Be this as it may everybody pities you So steady  so uniform in your conduct So desirous as you always said of sliding through life to the end of it unnoted and as I may add not wishing to be observed even for your silent benevolence sufficiently happy in the noble consciousness which rewards it  Rather useful than glaring  your deserved motto though now push'd into blaze as we see to your regret and yet blamed at home for the faults of othersHow must such a virtue suffer on every handYet it must be allowed that your present trial is but proportion'd to your prudence  As all your friends without doors are apprehensive that some other unhappy event may result from so violent a contention in which it seems the families on both sides are now engaged I must desire you to enable me on the authority of your own information to do you occasional justice  My mamma and all of us like the rest of the world talk of nobody but you on this occasion and of the consequences which may follow from the resentments of a man of Mr Lovelace's spirit who as he gives out has been treated with high indignity by your uncles My mamma will have it that you cannot now with any decency either see him or correspond with him She is a good deal prepossessed by your uncle Antony who occasionally calls upon us as you know and on this rencounter has represented to her the crime which it would be in a sister to encourage a man who is to  wade  into her favour this was his expression thro' the blood of her brother  Write to me therefore my dear the whole of your story from the time that Mr Lovelace was first introduce  into your family and particularly an account of all that passed between him and your sister about which there are different reports some people supposing that the younger sister at least by her uncommon merit has stolen a lover from the elder And pray write in so full a manner as may gratify those  who know not so much of your affairs as I do If any thing unhappy should fall out from the violence of such spirits as you have to deal with your account of all things previous to it will be your justification  You see what you draw upon yourself by excelling all your sex Every individual of it who knows you or has heard of you seems to think you answerable to  her  for your conduct in points so very delicate and concerning  Every eye in short is upon you with the expectation of an example I wish to heaven you were at liberty to pursue your own methods All would then I dare say be easy and honourably ended But I dread your directors and directresses for your mamma admirably well qualified as she is to lead must submit to be led Your sister and brother will certainly put you out of your course  But this is a point you will not permit me to expatiate upon Pardon me therefore and I have doneYet why should I say Pardon me When your concerns are my concerns When your honour is my honour When I love you as never woman loved another And when you have allowed of that concern and of that love and have for years which in persons so young may be called many ranked in the first class of your friends  Your evergrateful and affectionate ANNA HOWE  Will you oblige me with a copy of the preamble to the clauses in your grandfather's will in your favour and allow me to send it to my aunt HarmanShe is very desirous to see it Yet your character has so charm'd her that tho' a stranger to you personally she assents to the preference given you in it before she knows his reasons for that preference  LETTER II Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    HarlowePlace  Jan  HOW you oppress me my dearest friend with your politeness I cannot doubt your sincerity but you should take care that you give me not reason from your kind partiality to call in question your judgment You do not distinguish that I take many admirable hints from you and have the art to pass them upon you for my own For in all you do in all you say nay in your very looks so animated you give lessons to one who loves you and observes you as I love and observe you without knowing that you doSo pray my dear be more sparing of your praise for the future lest after this confession we should suspect that you secretly intend to praise yourself while you would be thought only to commend another  Our family has indeed been strangely discomposed  Discomposed  It has been in  tumults  ever since the unhappy transaction and I have borne all the blame yet should have had too much concern from myself had I been more justly spared by every one else  For whether it be owing to a faulty impatience having been too indulgently treated to be  inured  to blame or to the regret I have to hear those censured on my account whom it is my duty to vindicate I have sometimes wished that it had pleased God to have taken me in my last fever when I had everybody's love and good opinion but oftener that I had never been distinguished by my grandpapa as I was Which has estranged from me I doubt my brother's and sister's affections at least has raised a jealousy with regard to the apprehended favour of my two uncle that nowandthen overshadows their love  My brother being happily recover'd of his fever and his wound in a hopeful way altho' he has not yet ventured abroad I will be as particular as you desire in the little history you demand of me But heaven forbid that any thing should ever happen which may require it to be produced for the purpose you so kindly mention  I will begin as you command with Mr Lovelace's address to my sister and be as brief as possible I will recite facts only and leave you to judge of the truth of the report raised that the younger sister has robbed the elder  It was in pursuance of a conference between Lord M and my uncle Antony that Mr Lovelace my papa and mamma not forbidding paid his respects to my sister Arabella My brother was then in Scotland busying himself in viewing the condition of the considerable estate which was left him there by his generous godmother together with one as considerable in Yorkshire I was also absent at my  Dairyhouse  as it is called  Her grandfather in order to invite her to him as often as her other friends would spare her indulged her in erecting and sittingup a dairyhouse in her own taste When finished it was so much admired for its elegant simplicity and convenience that the whole seat before of old time from its situation called  The Grove  was generally known by the name of  The Dairyhouse  her grandfather particularly was fond of having it so called  busied in the accounts relating to the estate which my grandfather had the goodness to bequeath me and which once a year are left to my inspection altho' I have given the whole into my papa's power  My sister made me a visit there the day after Mr Lovelace had been introduced and seemed highly pleased with the gentleman His birth his fortune in possession a clear  l per annum  as Lord M had assured my uncle presumptive heir to that nobleman's large estate His great expectations from Lady Sarah  Sadleir and Lady Betty Lawrance who with his uncle interested themselves very warmly he being the last of his line to see him married  'So handsome a manO her beloved Clary'  for then she was ready to love me dearly from the overflowings of her good humour on his account  'He was but  too  handsome a man for  her  Were she but as amiable as  somebody  there would be a probability of  holding  his affectionsFor he was wild she heard  very  wild very gay loved intrigueBut he was young a man of sense Would see his error could she but have patience with his faults if his faults were not cured by marriage'  Thus she ran on and then wanted me  'to see the charming man'  as she called himAgain concerned  'that she was not handsome enough for him'  With  'A sad thing that the man should have the advantage of the woman in that particular'  But then stepping to the glass she complimented herself  'That she was very  well  That there were many women deemed passable who were inferior to herself That she was always thought comely and let her tell me that comeliness having not so much to lose as beauty had would hold when that would evaporate and fly offNay for that matter'  and again she turn'd to the glass  'her features were not irregular her eyes not at all amiss'  And I remember they were more than usually brilliant at that time  'Nothing in short to be sound fault with tho' nothing very engaging she doubtedWas there Clary'  Excuse me my dear I never was thus particular before no not to you Nor would I now have written thus freely of a sister but that she makes a merit to my brother of disowning that she ever liked him as I shall mention hereafter And then you will always have me give you minute descriptions nor suffer me to pass by the air and manner in which things are  spoken that are to be taken notice of rightly observeing that air and manner often express more than the accompanying words  I congratulated her upon her prospects She received my compliments with a great deal of selfcomplacency  She liked the gentleman still more at his next visit And yet he made no particular address to her altho' an opportunity was given him for it This was wonder'd at as my uncle had introduced him into our family declaredly as a visitor to my sister But as we are ever ready to make excuses when in good humour with ourselves for the supposed slights of those whose approbation we wish to engage so my sister found out a reason much to Mr Lovelace's advantage for his not improving the opportunity that was given himIt was bashfulness truly in him Bashfulness in Mr Lovelace my dearIndeed gay and lively as he is he has not the look of an  impudent  man But I fancy it is many many years ago since he was bashful  Thus however could my sister make it out  'Upon her word she believed Mr Lovelace deserved not the bad character he had as to women He was really to  her  thinking a  modest  man He  would  have spoken out she believed But once or twice as he seemed to intend to do so he was under so  agree  able a confusion Such a profound respect he seemed to shew her A perfect  reverence  she thought She lov'd dearly that a gentleman in courtship should shew a reverence to his mistress'  So indeed we all do I believe And with reason since if I may judge from what I have seen in many families there is little enough of it shewn afterwardsAnd she told my aunt Hervey that she would be a little less upon the reserve next time he came  'She was not one of those  flirts  not she who would give pain to a person that deserved to be welltreated and the more for the greatness of his value for her'  I  wish she had not Somebody whom I love in her eye Yet is not her censure unjust I believeIs it my dearExcepting in one undue and harsh word  In his third visit Bella govern'd herself by this kind and considerate principle So that according to her own account of the matter the man  might  have spoken outBut he was still  bashful  He was not able to overcome this  unseasonable reverence  So this visit went off as the former  But now she began to be dissatisfied with him She compared his general character with This his particular behaviour to her and having never been courted before own'd herself puzzled how to deal with so odd a lover  'What did the man meanHad not her uncle brought him  declaredly  as a suiter to herIt could not be bashfulness now she thought of it since he might have open'd his mind to her  uncle  if he wanted courage to speak directly to  her  Not that she cared much for the man neither But it was right surely that a woman should be put out of doubt early as to a man's intentions in such a case as This from his own mouthBut truly she had begun to think that he was more solicitous to cultivate her  mamma  's good opinion than  hers  Everybody she own'd admired her mamma's conversationBut he was mistaken if he thought that would do with  her  And then for his own sake surely he should put it into her power to be complaisant to him if he gave her cause of approbation This distant behaviour she must take upon her to say was the more extraordinary as he continued his visits and declared himself extremely desirous to cultivate a friendship with the whole family and as he could have no doubt about her sense if she might take upon her to join her own with the general opinion he having taken great notice of and admired many of her  good things  as they fell from her lipsReserves were painful she  must needs say to open and free spirits like hers And yet she must tell my aunt'  to whom all this was directed  'that she should never forget what she ow'd to her sex and to herself were Mr Lovelace as unexceptionable in his morals as in his figure and were he to urge his suit ever so warmly'  I was not of her council I was still absent And it was agreed between my aunt Hervey and her that she was to be quite solemn and shy in his next visit if there were not a peculiarity in his address to her  But my sister it seems had not consider'd the matter well This was not the way as it proved to be taken with a man of Mr Lovelace's penetration for matters of  mere omission  Nor with  any  man since if love has not taken root deep enough to cause it to shoot out into declaration if an opportunity be fairly given for it there is little room to expect that the blighting winds of anger or resentment will bring it forward Then my poor sister is not naturally goodhumour'd This is too well known a truth for me to endeavour to conceal it especially from you She must therefore I doubt have appear'd to great disadvantage when she aim'd to be worsetemper'd than ordinary  How they managed it in this conversation I know not One would be tempted to think by the issue that Mr Lovelace was ungenerous enough to seek the occasion given  See Mr  Lovelace  's Letter  N  o  xxxi  in which he briefly accounts for his conduct in this affair  and to improve it Yet he thought fit to put the question tooBut she says it was not till by some means or other she knew not how he had wrought her up to such a pitch of displeasure with him that it was impossible for her to recover herself at the instant Nevertheless he reurged his question as expecting a definitive answer without waiting for the return of her temper or endeavouring to mollify her so that she was under a necessity of persisting in  her denial Yet gave him reason to think that she did not dislike his address only the  manner  of it his court being rather made to her mamma than to herself as if he were sure of  her  consent at any time  A good encouraging denial I must ownAs was the rest of her plea to wit  'A disinclination to change her stateExceedingly happy as she was She never could be happier'  And suchlike  consenting negatives  as I may call them and yet not intend a reflection upon my sister For what can any young creature in the like circumstances say when she is not sure but a too ready consent may subject her to the slights of a sex that generally values a blessing either more or less as it is obtained with difficulty or ease Miss Biddulph's answer to a copy of verses from a gentleman reproaching our sex as acting in disguise is not a bad one altho' you perhaps may think it too acknowleging for the female character  Ungen'rous sexTo scorn us if we're  kind  And yet upbraid us if we seem  severe  Do  YOU  t' encourage us to tell our mind  Yourselves put off disguise and be sincere  YOU  talk of CoquetryYour own false hearts  Compel  our sex to act dissembling parts  Here I am obliged to lay down my pen I will soon resume it  LETTER III Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Jan  AND thus as Mr Lovelace thought fit to  take it  had he his answer from my sister It was with very great regret as he pretended I doubt the man is an hypocrite my dear that be acquiesced in it  'So much determinedness such a noble firmness in my sister that there was no hope of prevailing upon her  to alter sentiments she had adopted on full consideration'  'He sigh'd  as Bella told us when he took his leave of her  'Profoundly sigh'd Grasp'd her hand and kissed it with  such  an ardorWithdrew with  such  an air of solemn respectShe had him then before herShe could almost find in her heart altho' he had vex'd her to pity him'  A good intentional preparative this pity since at the time she little thought that he would not renew his offer  He waited on my mamma after he had taken leave of Bella and reported his ill success in so respectful a manner both with regard to my sister and to the whole family and with so much concern that he was not accepted as a relation to it that it left upon them all my brother being then as I have said in Scotland impressions in his favour and a belief that this matter would certainly be brought on again But Mr Lovelace going up directly to town where he stay'd a whole fortnight and meeting there with my uncle Antony to whom he regretted his niece's unhappy resolution not to change her state it was seen that there was a total end put to the affair  My sister was not wanting to herself on this occasion but made a virtue of necessity and the man was quite another man with her  'A vain creature too well knowing his advantages Yet those not what she had conceived them to beCool and warm by fits and starts An aguelike lover A steady man a man of virtue a man of morals was worth a thousand of such gay flutterers Her sister Clary might think it worth her while perhaps to try to engage such a man She had patience She was mistress of persuasion and indeed to do the girl justice had  something  of a person But as for  her  she would not have a man of whose heart she could not be sure for one moment no not for the world And most sincerely glad was she that she had rejected him'  But when Mr Lovelace return'd into the country he thought fit to visit my papa and mamma hoping as he told them that however unhappy he had been in the rejection of the wish'dfor alliance he might be allowed to keep up an acquaintance and friendship with a family which he should always respect And then unhappily as I may say was I at home and present  It was immediately observed that his attention was fixed on me My sister as soon as he was gone in a spirit of bravery seem'd desirous to promote his address should it be tendered  My aunt Hervey was there and was pleased to say We should make the finest couple in England if my sister had no objectionNo indeed with a haughty toss was my sister's replyIt would be strange if she had after the denial she had given him upon full deliberation  My mamma declared That her only dislike of his alliance with either daughter was on account of his faulty morals  My uncle Harlowe That his  daughter  Clary as he delighted to call me from childhood would reform him if any woman in the world could  My uncle Antony gave his approbation in high terms But referr'd as my aunt had done to my sister  She repeated her contempt of him and declar'd that were there not another man in England she would not have him She was ready on the contrary she could assure them to resign her pretensions under hand and seal if Miss Clary were taken with his tinsel and if every one else approved of his address to the girl  My papa indeed after a long silence being urged to speak his mind by my uncle Antony said That he had a letter from his son James on his hearing of Mr Lovelace's visits to his daughter Arabella which he had not shewn to anybody but my mamma that  treaty being at an end when he received it That in this letter he expressed great dislikes to an alliance with Mr Lovelace on the score of his immoralities That he knew indeed there was an old grudge between them That being desirous to prevent all occasions of disunion and animosity in his family he would suspend the declaration of his own mind till his son arrived and till he had heard his further objections That he was the more inclined to make his son this compliment as Mr Lovelace's general character gave but too much ground for his son's dislike of him adding That he had heard So he supposed had everyone that he was a very extravagant man that he had contracted debts in his travels And indeed he was pleased to say he had the air of a spendthrift  These particulars I had partly from my aunt Hervey and partly from my sister for I was called out as soon as the subject was entered upon And when I returned my uncle Antony asked me How  I  should like Mr Lovelace Everybody saw he was pleased to say that I had made a conquest  I immediately answered Not at all He seemed to have too good an opinion both of his person and parts to have any great regard to his wife let him marry whom he would  My sister particularly was pleased with this answer and confirmed it to be just with a compliment to my judgmentFor it was  hers    But the very next day Lord M came to HarlowePlace I was then absent And in his nephew's name made a proposal in form declaring That it was the ambition of all his family to be related to ours And he hoped his kinsman would not have such an answer on the part of the younger sister as he had had on that of the elder  In short Mr Lovelace's visits were admitted as those of a man who had not deserved disrespect from our family but as to his address to me with a  reservation as above on my papa's part that he would determine nothing without his son My discretion as to the rest was confided in For still I had the same objections as to the man Nor would I when we were better acquainted hear anything but general talk from him giving him no opportunity of conversing with me in private  He bore this with a resignation little expected from his natural temper which is generally reported to be quick and hasty unused it seems from childhood to check or controul A case too common in considerable families where there is an only son And  his  mother never had any other child But as I have heretofore told you I could perceive notwithstanding this resignation that he had so good an opinion of himself as not to doubt that his person and accomplishments would insensibly engage me And could That be once done he told my aunt Hervey he should hope from so steady a temper that his hold in my affections would be durable While my sister accounted for his patience in another manner which would perhaps have had more force if it had come from a person less prejudiced  'That the man was not fond of marrying at all That he might perhaps have halfascore mistresses and that delay might be as convenient for his  roving  as for my  wellacted  indifference'  That was her kind expression  Whatever were his motive for a patience so generally believed to be out of his usual character and where the object of his address was supposed to be of fortune considerable enough to engage his warmest attention he certainly escaped many mortifications by it For while my papa suspended his approbation till my brother's arrival he received from everyone those civilities which were due to his birth And altho' we heard from time to time reports to his disadvantage with regard to morals yet could we not question him upon them without giving him greater advantages  than the situation he was in with us would justify to prudence since it was much more likely that his address would  not  be allowed of than that it  would    And thus was he admitted to converse with our family almost upon his own terms for while my friends saw nothing in his behaviour but what was extremely respectful and observed in him no violent importunity they seemed to have taken a great liking to his conversation While I considered him only as a a common guest when he came and thought myself no more concerned in his visits nor at his entrance or departure than any other of the family  But this indifference of my side was the means of procuring him one very great advantage for upon it was grounded that correspondence by letters which succeededand which had it been to be begun when the familyanimosity broke out would never have been entered into on my part The occasion was this  My uncle Hervey has a young gentleman intrusted to his care whom he has thoughts of sending abroad a year or two hence to make the Grand Tour as it is called and finding Mr Lovelace could give a good account of everything necessary for a young traveller to observe upon such an occasion he desired him to write down a description of the courts and countries he had visited and what was most worthy of curiosity in them  He consented on condition that I would  direct  his subjects as he called it And as everyone had heard his manner of writing commended and thought his relations might be agreeable amusements in winter evenings and that he could have no opportunity particularly to address me in them since they were to be read in full assembly before they were to be given to the young gentleman I made the less scruple to write and to make observations and put questions for our further informationStill the less perhaps as I love writing and those who do are fond you know of  occasions to use the pen And then having every one's consent and my uncle Hervey's desire that I would I thought that if I had been the only scrupulous person it would have shewn a particularity that a vain man would construe to his advantage and which my sister would not fail to animadvert upon  You have seen some of these letters and have been pleased with his account of persons places and things and we have both agreed that he was no common observer upon what he had seen  My sister herself allowed that the man had a tolerable knack of writing and describing And my papa who had been abroad in his youth said That his remarks were curious and shewed him to be a person of reading judgment and taste  Thus was a kind of correspondence begun between him and me with general approbation while everyone wonder'd at and was pleased with his patient veneration of me for so they called it However it was not doubted that he would soon be more importunate since his visits were more frequent and he acknowleged to my aunt Hervey a passion for me accompany'd with an awe that he had never known before to which he attributed what he called his but  seeming  acquiescence with my papa's pleasure and the distance I kept him at And yet my dear this may be his usual manner of behaviour to our sex for had not my sister at first all his reverences  Mean time my father expecting this importunity kept in readiness the reports he had heard in his disfavour to charge them upon him then as so many objections to his address And it was highly agreeable to me that he did so It would have been strange if it were not since the person who could reject Mr Wyerley's address for the sake of his  free opinions  must have been inexcusable had she not rejected another's for his  freer practices    But I should own that in the letters he sent me  upon the general subject he more than once inclosed a particular one declaring his passionate regards for me and complaining with fervour enough of my reserves But of these I took not the least notice for as I had not written to him at all but upon a subject so general I thought it was but right to let what he wrote upon one so particular pass off as if I never had seen it and the rather as I was not then at liberty from the approbation his letters met with to break off the correspondence without assigning the true reason for doing so Besides with all his respectful assiduities it was easy to observe if it had not been his general character that his temper is naturally haughty and violent and I had seen enough of that untractable spirit in my brother to like it in one who hoped to be still nearer related to me  I had a little specimen of this temper of his upon the very occasion I have mentioned For after he had sent me a third particular letter with the general one he asked me the next time he came to HarlowePlace If I had not received such a one from himI told him I should never answer one so sent and that I had waited for such an occasion as he had now given me to tell him so I desired him therefore not to write again on the subject assuring him that if he did I would return both and never write another line to him  You cannot imagine how saucily the man looked as if in short he was disappointed that he had not made a more sensible impression upon me And when he recollected himself as he did immediately what a visible Struggle it cost him to change his haughty airs for more placid ones But I took no notice of either for I thought it best to convince him by the coolness and indifference with which I repulsed his forward hopes at the same time intending to avoid the affectation of pride or vanity that he was not considerable enough in my eyes to make me take overready offence at what he said or how he looked  In other words that I had not value enough for him to treat him with peculiarity either by smiles or frowns Indeed he had cunning enough to give me undesignedly a piece of instruction which taught me this caution for he had said in conversation once  'That if a man could not make a lady in courtship own herself  pleased  with him it was as  much  and oftentimes  more  to his purpose to make her  angry  with him'  I must break off here But will continue the subject the very first opportunity Mean time I am  Your most affectionate friend and servant CL HARLOWE  LETTER IV Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Jan  THIS my dear was the situation Mr Lovelace and I were in when my brother arrived from Scotland  The moment Mr Lovelace's visits were mentioned to him he without either hesitation or apology expressed his disapprobation of them He found great flaws in his character and took the liberty to say in so many words That he wondered how it came into the hearts of his uncles to encourage such a man for  either  of his sisters At the same time returning his thanks to my father for declining his consent till  he  arrived in such a manner I thought as a superior would do when he commended an inferior for haveing well performed his duty in his absence  He justified his avowed inveteracy by common fame and by what he had known of him at college declaring That he had ever hated him ever should hate him and would never own him for a brother or me for a sister if I married him  That collegebegun antipathy I have heard accounted for in this manner  Mr Lovelace was always noted for his vivacity and courage and no less it seems for the swift and surprising progress he made in all parts of literature For diligence in his studies in the hours of study he had hardly his equal This it seems was his general character at the university and it gained him many friends among the more learned youth while those who did not love him feared him by reason of the offence his vivacity made him too ready to give and of the courage he shewed in supporting the offence when given which procured him as many followers as he pleased among the mischievous sortNo very amiable character you'll say upon the whole  But my brother's temper was not happier His native haughtiness could not bear a superiority so visible and whom we fear more than love we are not far from hating And having less command of his passions than the other was evermore the subject of his perhaps  indecent  ridicule So that they never me  without quarreling And everybody either from love or fear siding with his antagonist he had a most uneasy time of it while both continued in the same collegeIt was the less wonder the efore that a young man who is not noted for the gentleness of his temper should resume an antipathy early begun and so deeplyrooted  He found my sister who waited but for the occasion ready to join him in his resentments against the man he hated She utterly disclaimed all manner of regard for him  'Never liked him at allHis estate was certainly much incumber'd It was impossible it should be otherwise so intirely devoted as he was to his pleasures He kept no house had no equipage Nobody pretended that he wanted pride The reason therefore was easy to be guessed at'  And then did she boast of and my brother praise her for refusing him And both joined on all occasions to depreciate him and not seldom  made  the occasions their displeasure  against him causing every subject to run into this if it began not with it  I was not solicitous to vindicate him when I was not joined in their reflections I told them I did not value him enough to make a difference in the family on his account And as he was supposed to have given too much cause for their ill opinion of him I thought he ought to take the consequence of his own faults  Nowandthen indeed when I observed that their vehemence carried them beyond all bounds of probability I thought it but justice to put in a word for him But this only subjected me to reproach as haveing a prepossession in his favour that I would not ownSo that when I could not change the subject I used to retire either to my music or to my closet  Their behaviour to him when they could not help seeing him was very cold and disobliging but as yet not directly affrontive For they were in hopes of prevailing upon my papa to forbid his visits But as there was nothing in his behaviour that might warrant such a treatment of a man of his birth and fortune they succeeded not And then they were very earnest with  me  to forbid them I ask'd What authority I had to take such a step in my father's house and when my behaviour to him was so distant that he seemed to be as much the guest of any other person of the family themselves excepted as mineIn revenge they told me That it was cunning management between us and that we both understood one another better than we pretended to do And at last they gave such a loose to their passions all of a sudden  The reason of this their moreopenly shewn animos  ty is given in  letter xiii  as I may say that instead of withdrawing as they used to do when he came they threw themselves in his way purposely to affront him  Mr Lovelace you may believe very ill brooked  this But nevertheless contented himself to complai  of it to me In high terms however telling me that but for my sake my brother's treatment of him was not to be borne  I was sorry for the merit this gave him in his own opinion with me And the more as some of the affronts he received were too flagrant to be excused But I told him That I was determin'd not to fall out with my brother if I could help it whatever were his faults And since they could not see one another with temper should be glad that he would not throw himself in my brother's way and I was sure my brother would not seek  him    He was very much nettled at this answer But said He must bear his affronts if I would have it so He had been accused himself of violence in his temper But he hoped to shew on this occasion that he had a command of his passions which few young men so provoked would be  able  to shew and doubted not but it would be attributed to a  proper motive  by a person of my generosity and penetration  My brother had just before with the approbation of my uncles employ'd a person related to a discharged bailiff or steward of Lord M who had had the management of some part of Mr Lovelace's affairs from which he was also dismissed by him to inquire into his debts after his companions into his amours and the like  My aunt Hervey in confidence gave me the following particulars of what the man said of him  'That he was a generous landlord That he spared nothing for solid and lasting improvements upon his estate And that he looked into his own affairs and understood them That he had when abroad been very expensive and contracted a large debt for he made no secret of his affairs yet chose to limit himself to an annual sum and to decline equipage in order to avoid being obliged to his uncle and aunts from whom he might have what money  he pleased but that he was very jealous of their controul had often quarrels with them and treated them so freely that they were all afraid of him However that his estate was never mortgaged as my brother had heard it was his credit was always high and he believed he was by this time near upon if not quite clear of the world  'He was a sad gentleman he said as to womenIf his tenants had pretty daughters they chose to keep them out of his sight He believed he kept no particular mistress for he had heard  newelty  that was the man's word was everything with him But for his uncle's and aunts teazings fansy'd he would not think of marriage Was never known to be disguised with liquor But was a great plotter and a great writer That he lived a wild life in town by what he had heard Had six or seven companions as bad as himself whom nowandthen he brought down with him and the country was always glad when they went up again He would have it that altho' passionate he was goodhumour'd loved as well to take a jest as to give one and would railly himself upon occasion the freest of any man he ever knew'  This was his character from an enemy for as my aunt observed every thing the man said commendably of him came grudgingly with a  Must needs sayTo do him justice  c while the contrary was delivered with a free goodwill And this character as a worse was expected tho' This was bad enough not answering the end of inquiring after it my brother and sister were more apprehensive than before that his address would be encouraged since the worst part of it was known or supposed when he was first introduced to my sister  But with regard to myself I must observe in his disfavour that notwithstanding the merit he wanted to make with me for his patience upon my brother's  illtreatment of him I owed him no compliments for trying to conciliate with  him  Not that I believe it would have signified any thing if he had made ever such court either to him or to my sister Yet one might have expected from a man of his politeness and from his pretensions you know that he would have been willing to  try  Instead of which such a hearty contempt he shew'd of them both of my brother especially that I ever heard of it with aggravations And for me to have hinted at an alteration in his behaviour to my brother was an advantage I knew he would have been proud of and which therefore I had no mind to give himBut I doubted not that having so very little encouragement from  any  body his pride would soon take fire and he would of himself discontinue his visits or go to town where till he came acquainted with our family he used chiefly to reside And in this latter case he had no reason to expect that I would  receive  much less  answer  his letters the occasion which had led me to receive  any  of his being by this time over  But my brother's antipathy would not permit him to  wait  for such an event and after several excesses which Mr Lovelace still return'd with contempt and a haughtiness too much like that of the aggressor my brother took upon himself to fill up the doorway once when he came as if to oppose his entrance and upon his asking for me demanded What his business were with his sister  The other with a challenging air as my brother says told him He would answer a gentleman  any  question But he wished that Mr James Harlowe who had of late given himself high airs would remember that he was not  now  at college  Just then the good Dr Lewin who frequently honours me with a  visit of conversation  as he is pleased to call it and had parted with me in my own parlour came to the door and hearing the words interposed  both having their hands upon their swords And telling Mr Lovelace where I was he burst by my brother to come to me leaving him chafing he said like a hunted boar at bay  This alarm'd us all My father was pleased to hint to Mr Lovelace and I by his command spoke a great deal plainer that he wish'd he would discontinue his visits for the peacesake of the family  But Mr Lovelace is not a man to be easily brought to give up his purpose in a point especially wherein he pretends his heart is so much engag'd And an absolute prohibition not having been given things went on for a little while as before For I saw plainly that to have deny'd myself to his visits which however I declin'd receiving as often as I could was to bring forward some desperate issue between the two since the offence so readily given on one side was only brooked by the other out of consideration to me And thus did my brother's rashness lay me under an obligation where I would least have ow'd it  The intermediate proposals of Mr Symmes and Mr Mullins both in turn encouraged by my brother were inducements for him to be more patient for a while he being in hopes as nobody thought me overforward in Mr Lovelace's favour that he should engage my father and uncles to espouse the one or the other in opposition to  him  But when he found that I had interest enough to disengage myself from their addresses as I had before he went to Scotland and before Mr Lovelace visited here of Mr Wyerley's he then kept no measures And first set himself to upbraid me for a supposed prepossession which he treated as if it were criminal And then to insult Mr Lovelace in person And it being at Mr Edward Symmes's the brother of the other Symmes two miles off and no good Dr Lewin again to interpose the unhappy rencounter follow'd My brother was disarm'd in it as you have heard and on being  brought home and giving us ground to suppose he was much worse hurt than he really was and a fever ensuing everyone flam'd out and all was laid at my door  Mr Lovelace for three days together sent twice each day to inquire after my brother's health and altho' he received rude and even shocking returns he thought fit on the fourth day to make in person the fame inquiries and received still greater incivilities from my two uncles who happen'd to be both there My papa also was held by force from going to him with his sword in his hand altho' he had the gout upon him  I fainted away with terror seeing everyone so violent and hearing his voice swearing he would not depart without seeing me or making my uncles ask his pardon for the indignities he had received at their hands A door being also held fast lock'd between them my mamma struggling with my papa and my sister after treating him with virulence insulting me as fast as I recover'd But when he was told how ill I was he departed vowing revenge  He was ever a favourite with our domestics His bounty to them and having always something facetious to say to each had made them all of his party And on this occasion they privately blamed everybody else and reported his patience and gentlemanly behaviour till the provocations given him ran very high in such favourable terms that those reports and my apprehensions of the consequence of this treatment induced me to  read a letter  he sent me that night and it being written in the most respectful terms offering to submit the whole to my decision and to govern himself intirely by my will  to answer  it some days after  To this unhappy necessity was owing our renewed correspondence as I may call it Yet I did not write till I had inform'd myself from Mr Symmes's brother that he was really insulted into the act of drawing his  sword by my brother's repeatedly threatening upon his excusing himself out of regard to me to brand him if he did not and by all the inquiry I could make that he was again the sufferer from my uncles in a more violent manner than I have related  The same circumstances were related to my papa and other friends by Mr Symmes but they had gone too far in making themselves parties to the quarrel either to retract or forgive and I was forbid corresponding with him or to be seen a moment in his company  But one thing I can say but that in confidence because my mamma commanded me not to mention itThat expressing her apprehension of the consequences of the indignities offered to Mr Lovelace she told me She would leave it to my prudence to prevent all I could the impending mischief on  one  side  I am obliged to break off But I believe I have written enough to answer very fully all that you have commanded from me It is not for a child to seek to clear her own character or to justify her actions at the expence of the most revered ones Yet as I know that the account of all those further proceedings by which I may be affected will be interesting to so dear a friend who will communicate to others no more than what is fitting I will continue to write as I have opportunity as minutely as we are used to write to each other Indeed I have no delight as I have often told you equal to that which I take in conversing with youBy  letter  when I cannot in  person    Mean time I can't help saying that I am exceedingly concerned to find that I am become so much the public talk as  you  tell me and as  everybody  tells me I am Your kind your  precautionary  regard for my fame and the opportunity you have given me to tell my own story previous to any new accident which heaven avert is so like the warm friend I have  ever found my dear Miss Howe that with redoubled obligation you bind me to be  Your evergrateful and affectionate CLARISSA HARLOWE  Copy of the requested  PREAMBLE  to the clauses in her grandfather's will in her favour inclosed in the preceding letter  AS the particular estate I have mentioned and described above is principally of my own raising As my three sons have been uncommonly prosperous and are very rich The eldest by means of the unexpected benefits he reaps from his newfound mines The second by what has as unexpectedly fallen in to him on the deaths of several relations of his present wife the worthy daughter by both sides of very honourable families over and above the very large portion which he received with her in marriage My son Antony by his EastIndia traffick and successful voyages As furthermore my grandson James will be sufficiently provided for by his godmother Lovell's kindness to him who having no near relations assures me that she has as well by deed of gift as by will left him both her Scotish and English estates For never blessed be God therefore was there a family more prosperous in all its branches And as my second son James will very probably make it up to my grandson and also to my granddaughter Arabella to whom I intend no disrespect nor have reason for she is a very hopeful and dutiful child And as my sons John and Antony seem not inclined to a marry'd life so that my son James is the only one who has children or is likely to have anyFor all these reasons and because my dearest and beloved granddaughter Clarissa Harlowe has been from infancy a matchless young creature in her duty to me and admired  by all who knew her as a very extraordinary child I must therefore take the pleasure of considering her as my own peculiar child and this without intending offence and I hope it will not be taken as any since my son James can bestow his favours accordingly and in greater proportion upon Miss Arabella and Master JamesThese I say are the reasons which move me to dispose of the abovedescribed estate in the precious child's favour who is the delight of my old age and I verily think has contributed by her amiable duty and kind and tender regards to prolong my life  Wherefore it is my express will and commandment and I injoin my three sons John James and Antony and my grandson James and my granddaughter Arabella as they value my blessing and my memory and would wish their own last wills and desires to be fulfilled by  their  survivors that they will not impugn or contest the following bequests and dispositions in favour of my said granddaughter Clarissa altho' they should not be strictly conformable to law or the forms thereof nor suffer them to be controverted or disputed on any pretence whatsoever  And in this confidence c c c  LETTER V Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Jan  I HAVE been hinder'd from prosecuting my intention Neither nights nor mornings have been my own My mamma has been very ill and would have no other nurse but me I have not stirr'd from her bedside for she kept her bed and two nights I had the honour of sharing it with her  Her disorder was a very violent colic The contentions of these fierce these masculine spirits and the apprehension of mischiefs that may arise from the  increasing animosity which all  here  have against Mr Lovelace and his toowell known resentful and intrepid character she cannot bear Then the foundations laid as she dreads for jealousy and heartburnings in her own family late so happy and so united afflict exceedingly a gentle and sensible mind which has from the beginning on all occasions sacrifice its own inward satisfaction to outward peace My brother and sister who used very often to jar are now so much one and are so much together  caballing  was the word that dropped from her as if at unawares that she is full of fears of consequences that may followto my prejudice perhaps is her kind concern since she sees that they behave to me every hour with more and more shyness and reserve Yet would she but exert that authority which the superiority of her fine talents gives her all these familyfeuds might perhaps be crush'd in their butyet beginnings especially as she may be assured that all fitting concessions shall be made by me not only as they are my elders but for the sake of so excellent and so indulgent a mother  For if I may say to you my dear what I would not to any other person living it is my opinion that had she been of a temper that would have borne less she would have had ten times less to bear than she has had No commendation you'll say of the generosity of those spirits which can turn to its own disquiet so much condescending goodness  Upon my word I am sometimes tempted to think that we may make the world allow for and respect us as we please if we can but be sturdy in our wills and set out accordingly It is but being the  less  beloved for it that's all And if we have power to oblige those we have to do with it will not appear to  us  that we are Our flatterers will tell us any thing sooner than our faults  Were there not truth in this observation is it possible that my brother and sister could make their very failings their vehemences of such importance to all the family  'How will my  son  how will my  nephew  take this or that measure What will  he  say to it Let us consult  him  about it'  are references always previous to every resolution taken by his superiors whose will ought to be his Well may he expect to be treated with this deference by every other person when my papa himself generally so absolute constantly pays it to him and the more since his godmother's bounty has given independence to a spirit that was before under too little restraintBut whither may these reflections lead meI know you do not love any of us but my mamma and me and being above all disguises make me sensible that you do  not  oftener than I wish you didOught I then to add force to your dislikes of those whom I wish you more to likemy father especially for he poor gentleman has some excuse for his impatience of contradiction He is not naturally an illtemper'd man and in his person and air and in his conversation too when not under the torture of a gouty paroxysm everybody distinguishes the gentleman born and educated  Our sex perhaps must expect to bear a little  uncourtliness  shall I call itfrom the  husband  whom as the  lover  they let know the preference their hearts gave him to all other menSay what they will of generosity being a  manly  virtue but upon my word my dear I have ever yet observed that it is not to be met with in that sex one time in ten that it is to be found in oursBut my father was sour'd by the cruel distemper I have named which seized him all at once in the very prime of life in so violent a manner as to take from the most active of minds as  his  was all power of activity and that in all appearance for lifeIt imprison'd as I may say his lively spirits in  himself and turned the edge of them against his own peace his extraordinary prosperity adding but to his impatiency For those I believe who want the fewest earthly blessings most regret that they want any  But my brother what excuse can be made for his haughty and morose temper He is really my dear I am sorry to have occasion to say it an illtemper'd young man and treats my mamma sometimesIndeed he is not dutifulBut possessing everything he has the vice of age mingled with the ambition of youth and enjoys nothingbut his own haughtiness and illtemper I was going to sayYet again am I adding force to your dislikes of some of usOnce my dear it was perhaps in your power to have moulded him as you pleasedCould you have been my sisterThen had I had a friend in a sisterBut no wonder that he don't love you now who could nip in the bud and that with a disdain let me say too much of kin to his haughtiness a passion that would not have wanted a fervor worthy of the object and which possibly would have  made  him so  But no more of this I will prosecute my former intention in my next which I will sit down to as soon as breakfast is over dispatching this by the messenger whom you have so kindly sent to inquire after us on my silence Mean time I am  Your most affectionate and obliged friend and servant CL HARLOWE  LETTER VI Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    HarlowePlace  Jan  I WILL now resume my narrative of proceedings hereMy brother being in a good way altho' you may be sure that his resentments are rather heighten'd  than abated by the galling disgrace he has received my friends my papa and uncles however if not my brother and sister begin to think that I have been treated unkindly My mamma has been so good as to tell me this since I sent away my last  Nevertheless I believe they all think that I receive letters from Mr Lovelace But Lord M being inclin'd rather to support than to blame his nephew they seem to be so much afraid of him that they do not put it to me whether I do or not conniving on the contrary as it should seem at the only method left to allay the vehemence of a spirit which they have so much provoked For he still insists upon satisfaction from my uncles and this possibly for he wants not art as the best way to be introduced again with some advantage into our family And indeed my aunt Hervey has put it to my mamma whether it were not best to prevail upon my brother to take a turn to his Yorkshire estate which he was intending to do before and to tarry there till all is blown over  But this is very far from being his intention For he has already begun to hint again that he shall never be easy or satisfy'd till I am marry'd and finding neither Mr Symmes nor Mr Mullins will be accepted has proposed Mr Wyerley once more on the score of his great passion for me This I have again rejected and but yesterday he mention'd one who has apply'd to him by letter making high offers This is Mr Solmes  rich  Solmes you know they call him But this has not met with the attention of one single soul  If none of his schemes of marrying me take effect he has thoughts I am told of proposing to me to go to Scotland in order as the compliment is to put his house there in such order as our own is in But this my mamma intends to oppose for her own sake because having relieved her as she is pleased to say of the houshold cares for which my sister you  know has no turn they must again devolve upon her if I go And if  she  did not oppose it  I  should for believe me I have no mind to be his housekeeper and I am sure were I to go with him I should be treated rather as a servant than a sisterPerhaps not the better because I  am  his sister And if Mr Lovelace should follow me things might be worse than they are now  But I have besought my mamma who is apprehensive of Mr Lovelace's visits and for fear of whom my uncles never stir out without arms and armed servants my brother also being near well enough to go abroad again to procure me permission to be your guest for a fortnight or soWill your mamma think you my dear give me leave  I dare not ask to go to my dairyhouse as my good grandfather would call it For I am now afraid of being thought to have a wish to enjoy that independence to which his will has intitled me And as matters are situated such a wish would be imputed to my favour to the man whom they have now so great an antipathy to And indeed could I be as easy and happy here as I used to be I would defy that man and all his sex and never repent that I have given the power of my fortune into my papa's hands  Just now my mamma has rejoiced me with the news that my requested permission is granted Everyone thinks it best that I should go to you except my brother But he was told that he must not expect to rule in every thing I am to be sent for into the great parlour where are my two uncles and my aunt Hervey and to be acquainted with this concession in form  You know my dear that there is a good deal of solemnity among us But never was there a family more united in its different branches than ours  Our uncles consider us as their own children and declare that it is for our sakes they live single So that they are advised with upon every article relating to or that may affect us It is therefore the less wonder at a time when they understand that Mr Lovelace is determin'd to pay us an  amicable  visit as he calls it but which I am sure cannot end so that they should both be consulted upon the permission I had desired to attend you  I will acquaint you with what passed at the general leave given me to be your guest And yet I know that you will not love my brother the better for my communication But I am angry with him myself and cannot help it And besides it is proper to let you know the terms I go upon and their motives for permitting me to go  Clary said my mamma as soon as I enter'd the great parlour your request to go to Miss Howe's for a few days has been taken into consideration and granted  Much against my liking I assure you said my brother rudely interrupting her  Son James said my father and knit his brows  He was not daunted His arm is in a sling He often has the mean art to look upon  that  when any thing is hinted that may be supposed to lead towards the least favour to or reconciliation with Mr LovelaceLet the  girl  then I am often  the girl  with him be prohibited seeing that vile libertine  Nobody spoke  Do you hear sister Clary taking their silence for approbation of what  he  had dictated you are not to receive visits from Lord M's nephew  Everyone still remained silent  Do you so understand the licence you have Miss interrogated he  I would be glad Sir said I to understand that you are my  brother  and that  you  would understand that you are  only  my brother  O the fond fond heart with a s  eer of insult lifting up his hands  Sir said I to my papa to your justice I appeal If I have deserved reflection let me not be spar'd But if I am to be answerable for the rashness  No moreNo more of either side said my papa You are not to receive the visits of that Lovelace tho'Nor are you son James to reflect upon your sister She is a worthy child  Sir I have done reply'd heand yet I have  her  honour at heart as much as the honour of the rest of the family  And  hence  Sir retorted I your unbrotherly reflections upon me  Well but you observe Miss said he that it is not  I  but your  papa  that tells you that you are not to receive the visits of that Lovelace  Cousin Harlowe said my aunt Hervey allow me to say That my cousin Clary's prudence may be confided in  I am  convinc'd  it may join'd my mamma  But Aunt but Madam put in my sister there is no hurt I presume in letting my sister know the condition she goes to Miss Howe upon since if he gets a knack of visiting her there  You may be sure interrupted my uncle Harlowe he will endeavour to see her there  So would such an impudent man  here  said my uncle Antony And 'tis better  there  than  here    Better  nowhere  said my papaI command you turning to me on pain of my displeasure that you see him not at all  I will not Sir in any way of encouragement I do assure you Nor at all if I can decently avoid it  You know with what indifference said my mamma she has hitherto seen himHer prudence may be trusted to as my sister Hervey says  With what ap  pa  rent indifference drolled my brother  Son James said my father sternly  I have done Sir said heBut again in a provoking manner reminded me of the prohibition  Thus ended this conference  Will you engage my dear that the hated man shall not come near your houseBut what an inconsistence is this when they consent to my going thinking his visits  here  no otherwise to be avoidedBut if he does come I charge you never leave us alone together  As I have no reason to doubt a welcome from your mamma I will put everything in order here and be with you in two or three days  Mean time I am  Your most affectionate and obliged CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER VII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE  After her return from her  HarlowePlace  Feb  I BEG your excuse for not writing sooner Alas my dear I have sad prospects before me My brother and sister have succeeded in all their views They have found out another lover for me an hideous oneYet he is encouraged by everybodyNo wonder that I was order'd home so suddenlyAt an hour's warningNo other notice you know than what was brought with the chariot that was to carry me backIt was for fear as I have been inform'd an unworthy fear that I should have enter'd  into any concert with Mr Lovelace had I known their motive for commanding me home apprehending 'tis evident that I should dislike the man  And well might they apprehend soFor who do you think he isNo other than that  Solmes  Could you have believed itAnd they are all determined too my mamma with the restDear dear excellence how could she be thus brought overwhen I am assured that on his first being proposed she was pleased to say That had Mr Solmes the  Indies  in possession and would endow me with them she should not think him deserving of her Clarissa Harlowe  The reception I met with at my return so different from what I used to meet with on every little absence and now I had been from them three weeks convinced me that I was to suffer for the happiness I had had in your company and conversation for that most agreeable period I will give you an account of it  My brother met me at the door and gave me his hand when I stepp'd out of the chariot He bow'd very low Pray Miss favour meI thought it in good humour but found it afterwards mock respect And so he led me in great form I prattling all the way inquiring of everybody's health altho' I was so soon to see them and there was hardly time for answers into the great parlour where were my father mother my two uncles and my sister  I was struck all of a heap as soon as I enter'd to see a solemnity which I had been so little used to on the like occasions in the countenance of every dear relation They all kept their seats I ran to my papa and kneeled Then to my mamma And met from both a cold salute From my papa a blessing but halfpronounced My mamma indeed called me Child but embraced me not with her usual indulgent ardor  After I had paid my duty to my uncles and my compliments to my sister which she received with solemn and stiff form I was bid to sit down But my heart was full And I said it became me to stand if I  could  stand a reception so awful and unusual I was forced to turn my face from them and pull out my handkerchief  My unbrotherly accuser hereupon stood forth and charg'd me with having received no less than  five or six visits  at Miss Howe's from the man they had all so much reason to hate that was the expression notwithstanding the commands I had received to the contrary And he bid me deny it if I could  I had never been used I said to deny the truth nor would I now I owned I had in the passed three weeks seen the person I presumed he meant  oftener  than five or six times Pray hear me out brother said I for he was going to flameBut he always came and asked for Mrs or Miss Howe  I proceeded That I had reason to believe that both Mrs Howe and Miss as matters stood would much rather have excused his visits but they had more than once apologiz'd that having not the same reason my papa had to forbid him their house his rank and fortune intitled him to civility  You see my dear I made not the pleas I might have made  My brother seem'd ready to give a loose to his passion My papa put on the countenance which always portends a gathering storm My uncles mutteringly whisper'd And my sister aggravatingly held up her hands While I begg'd to be heard outand my mamma said Let the  child  that was her kind word be heard  I hoped I said there was no harm done That it became not me to prescribe to Mrs or Miss Howe who should be their visitors That Mrs Howe was always diverted with the raillery that passed between  Miss and him That I had no reason to challenge  her  guest for  my  visitor as I should seem to have done had I refused to go into their company when he was with them That I had never seen him out of the presence of one or both of those ladies and had signify'd to him once on his urging for a few moments private conversation with me that unless a reconciliation were effected between my family and his he must not expect that I would countenance his visits much less give him an opportunity of that sort  I told them further That Miss Howe so well understood my mind that she never left me a moment while he was there That when he came if I was not below in the parlour I would not suffer myself to be called to him Altho' I thought it would be an affectation which would give him advantage rather than the contrary if I had left company when he came in or refused to enter into it when I found he would stay any time  My brother heard me out with such a kind of impatience as shew'd he was resolved to be dissatisfy'd with me say what I would The rest as the event has proved behav'd as if they  would  have been satisfy'd had they not further points to carry by intimidating me All this made it evident as I mention'd above that they themselves expected not my voluntary compliance and was a tacit confession of the disagreeableness of the person they had to propose  I was no sooner silent than my  brother  swore altho' in my papa's presence swore uncheck'd either by eye or countenance That for his part he would  never  be reconciled to that libertine And that he would renounce me for a sister if I encouraged the addresses of a man so obnoxious to them all  A man who had like to have been my brother's murderer my  sister  said with a face even bursting with restraint of passion  The poor Bella has you know a plump highfed face if I may be allow'd the expressionYou I know will forgive me for this liberty of speech sooner than I can myself Yet how can one be such a reptile as not to turn when trampled upon  My  papa  with vehemence both of action and voice my father has you know a terrible voice when he is angry told me that I had met with too much indulgence in being allow'd to refuse  this  gentleman and the  other  gentleman and it was now  his  turn to be obey'd  Very true my  mamma  saidAnd hoped his will would not now be disputed by a child so favour'd  To shew they were all of a sentiment my uncle  Harlowe  said He hoped his beloved niece only wanted to know her papa's will to obey it  And my uncle  Antony  in his rougher manner That I would not give them reason to apprehend that I thought my grandfather's favour to me had made me independent of them allIf I did he could tell me the will could be set aside and  should    I was astonish'd you must needs thinkWhose addresses now thought I is this treatment preparative toMr Wyerley's againor whoseAnd then as high comparisons where  self  is concern'd sooner than low come into young peoples heads be it for whom it will this is wooing as the English did for the heiress of Scotland in the time of Edward the sixthBut that it could be for Solmes how should it enter into my head  I did not know I said that I had given occasion for this harshness I hoped I should always have a just sense of their favour to me superadded to the duty I ow'd as a daughter and a niece But that I was so much surprised at a reception so unusual and unexpected that I hoped my papa and mamma would give me leave to retire in order to recollect myself  No one gainsaying I made my silent compliments and withdrewleaving my brother and sister as I thought pleased and as if they wanted to congratulate each other on having occasioned so severe a beginning to be made with me  I went up to my chamber and there with my faithful Hannah deplor'd the determin'd face which the new proposal it was plain they had to make me wore  I had not recover'd myself when I was sent for down to tea I begg'd by my maid to be excus'd attending But on the repeated command went down with as much chearfulness as I could assume and had a new fault to clear myself of For my brother so pregnant a thing is determin'd illwill by intimations equally rude and intelligible charg'd my desire of being excus'd coming down to sullens because a certain person had been spoken against upon whom as he supposed my fancy ran  I could easily answer you Sir said I as such a reflection deserves But I forbear If I do not find a brother in  you  you shall have a sister in  me    Pretty meekness Bella whisperingly said looking at my brother and lifting up her lip in contempt  He with an imperious air bid me  deserve  his love and I should be sure to  have  it  As we sat my mamma in her admirable manner expatiated upon brotherly and sisterly love indulgently blam'd my brother and sister upon having taken up displeasure too lightly against me and politically if I may so say answer'd for my obedience to my papa's will  Then it would be all well  my papa was pleas'd to say  Then they should dote upon me  was my brother's expression  Love me as well as ever  was my sister's And my uncles  That I should then be the pride of their hearts  But alas what a forfeiture of all these must I make  This was the reception I had on my return from you  Mr Solmes came in before we had done tea My uncle Antony presented him to me as a gentleman he had a particular friendship for My uncle Harlowe in terms equally favourable for him My father said Mr Solmes is my friend Clarissa Harlowe My mamma look'd at him and look'd at me nowand  hen as he sat near me I thought with concernI at  her  with eyes appealing for pityAt  him  when I could glance at him with disgust little short of affrightment While my brother and sister Mr  Solmes  'dhim and  Sirr  'dhim up with high favour So ca  ess'd in short by allyet such a wretchBut I will at present only add My humble thanks and duty to your honour'd mamma to whom I will particularly write to express the grateful sense I have of her goodness to me and that I am  Your ever obliged CL HARLOWE  LETTER VIII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Feb  THEY drive on here at a furious rate The man lives here I think He courts them and is more and more a favourite Such terms such settlements That's the cry  O my dear that I had not reason to deplore the family fault immensely rich as they all are But this I may the more unreservedly say to you as we have often join'd in the same concern I for a father and uncles you for a mother in every other respect faultless  Hitherto I seem to be delivered over to my brother who pretends as great love to me as ever  You may believe I have been very sincere with him But he affects to railly me and not to believe it possible that one so dutiful and so discreet as his sister Clary can resolve to disoblige all her friends  Indeed I tremble at the prospect before me for it is evident that they are strangely determin'd  My father and mother industriously avoid giving me opportunity of speaking to them alone They ask not for my approbation intending as it should seem to  suppose  me into their will And with them I shall hope to prevail or with nobody They have not the  interest  in compelling me as my brother and sister have I say less therefore to them reserving my whole force for an audience with my father if he will permit me a patient ear How difficult is it my dear to give a negative where both duty and inclination join to make one wish to oblige  I have already stood the shock of three of this man's particular visits besides my share in his more general ones and find it is impossible I should ever endure him He has but a very ordinary share of understanding is very illiterate knows nothing but the value of estates and how to improve them and what belongs to landjobbing and husbandry Yet am I as one stupid I think They have begun so cruelly with me that I have not spirit enough to assert my own negative  My good Mrs Norton they had endeavour'd it seems to influence before I came home So intent are they to carry their point And her opinion not being to their liking she has been told that she would do well to decline visiting here for the present Yet she is the person of all the world next to my mamma the most likely to prevail upon me were the measures they are engag'd in reasonable measures or such as she could think so  My aunt likewise having said that she did not think her niece could ever be brought to like Mr Solmes has been obliged to learn another lesson  I am to have a visit from her tomorrow And  ince I have refused so much as to hear from my brother and sister what the noble settlements are to be she is to acquaint me with the particulars and to  eceive from me my determination For my father I am told will not have patience but to  suppose  that I shall stand in opposition to his will  Mean time it has been signify'd to me that it will be acceptable if I do not think of going to church next Sunday  The same signification was made me for last Sunday and I obey'd They are apprehensive that Mr Lovelace will be there with design to come home with me  Help me dear Miss Howe to a little of your charming spirit I never more wanted it  The man you may suppose has no reason to boast of his progress with me He has not the sense to say any thing to the purpose His courtship indeed is to  them  and my brother pretends to court me as his proxy truly I utterly to my brother refuse his application but thinking a person so well received and recommended by all my family intitled to good manners all I say against him is affectedly attributed to coyness And he not being sensible of his own imperfections believes that my avoiding him when I can and the reserves I express are owing to nothing elseFor as I said all his courtship is to  them  and I have no opportunity of saying No to one who asks me not the question And so with an air of  mannish  superiority he seems rather to pity the bashful girl than apprehend that he shall not succeed  February  I have had the expected conference with my aunt  I have been obliged to hear the man's proposal  from her and all their motives for espousing him a they do I am even loth to mention how equally unjust it is for him to make such offers or for those I am bound to reverence to accept of them I hate him more than before One great estate is already obtained at the expence of the relations to it tho' distant relations my brother's I mean by his god mother And this has given the hope however chimerical that hope of procuring others and that my own at least may revert to the family And yet in my opinion the world is but one great family originally it was so What then is this narrow selfish+ness that reigns in us but relationship remembre  against relationship forgot  But here upon my absolute refusal of him upo  any  terms have I had a signification made me tha  wounds me to the heart How can I tell it you Ye  I must It is my dear that I must not for a mon  to come or till licence obtained correspond with  any  body out of the house  My brother upon my aunt's report made how+ever as I am informed in the gentlest manner an  even giving remote hopes which she had no commission from me to give brought me in authoritative terms the prohibition  Not to Miss Howe said I  No not to Miss Howe  Madam  tauntingly For have you not acknowleg'd that Lovelace is a favourite there  See my dear Miss Howe  And do you think brother this is the way  Do  you  look to thatBut your letters will be stopt I can tell youAnd away he flung  My sister came to me soon afterSister Clary you are going on in a fine way I understand But as  there are people who are supposed to harden you against your duty I am to tell you that it will be taken well if you avoid visits or visitings for a week or two till further order  Can this be from those who have authority  Ask them ask them child with a twirl of her fingerI have deliver'd my message Your papa will be obey'd He is willing to hope you to be all obedience and would prevent all  incitements  to refractoriness  I knew my duty I said and hoped I should not find impossible conditions annexed to it  A pert young creature vain and conceited she called me I was the only judge in my own wife opinion of what was right and fit She for her part had long seen through my specious ways And now I should shew everybody what I was at bottom  Dear Bella said I hands and eyes lifted upwhy all thisDear dear Bella why  None of your dear dear Bella's to meI tell you I see thro' your  witchcrafts  That was her strange word And away she flung adding as she wentAnd so will everybody else very quickly I dare say  Bless me said I to myself what a sister have IHow have I deserv'd this Then I again regretted my grandfather's too distinguishing goodness to me  Feb in the evening  What my brother and sister have said against me I cannot tellBut I am in heavy disgrace with my papa  I was sent for down to tea I went with a very chearful aspect But had occasion soon to change it  Such a solemnity in everybody's countenanceMy mamma's eyes were fixed upon the teacups and when she looked up it was heavily as if her eyelids had weights upon them and then not to me My papa sat halfaside in his elbowchair that his  head might be turn'd from me his hands folded and waving as it were up and down his fingers poor dear gentleman in motion as if angry to the very ends of them My sister sat swelling My brother looked at me with scorn having measured me as I may say with his eyes as I enter'd from head to foot My aunt was there and looked upon me as if with kindness restrained bending coldly to my compliment to her as she sat and then cast an eye first on my brother then on my sister as if to give the reason so I am willing to construe it of her unusual stiffnessBless me my dear that they should choose to intimidate rather than invite a mind till now no  thought either unpersuadable or ungenerous  I took my seat Shall I make tea Madam to my mammaI always used you know my dear to make tea  No a very short sentence in one very short word was the expressive answer And she was pleased to take the canister in her own hand  My sister's Betty attending my brother bid her goHe would fill the water  My heart was up at my mouth I did not know what to do with myself What is to follow thought I  Just after the second dish out stept my mammaA word with you sister Hervey taking her in he  hand Presently my sister dropt away Then my brother So I was left alone with my papa  He looked so very sternly that my heart failed me as twice or thrice I would have addressed myself to him Nothing but solemn silence on all hands having passed before  At last I asked If it were his pleasure that I should pour him out another dish  He answer'd me with the same angry monosyllable which I had received from my mamma before and then arose and walked about the room I arose too with intent to throw myself at his feet but was too  much overawed by his sternness even to make such an expression of my duty to him as my heart overflowed with  At last as he supported himself because of his gout on the back of a chair I took a little more courage and approaching him besought him to acquaint me in what I had offended him  He turn'd from me and in a strong voice Clarissa Harlowe said he know that I will be obey'd  God forbid Sir that you should notI have never yet opposed your will  Nor I your whimsies Clarissa Harlowe interrupted heDon't let me run the fate of all who shew  ndulgence to your sex To be the more contradicted for mine to you  My papa you know my dear has not any more than my brother a kind opinion of our sex altho' there is not a more condescending wife in the world than my mamma  I was going to make protestations of dutyNo protestations girlNo wordsI will not be prated toI will be obey'dI have no childI will have no child but an obedient one  Sir you never had reason I hope  Tell me not what I never  had  but what I  have  and what I  shall  have  Good Sir be pleased to hear meMy brother and my sister I fear  Your brother and sister shall not be spoken against girlThey have a just concern for the honour of my family  And I hope Sir  Hope nothingTell me not of  hopes  but of  facts  I ask nothing of you but what is in your power to comply with and what it is your duty to comply with  Then Sir I will comply with itBut yet I hope from your goodness  No expostulationsNo  but's  girlNo qualifyingsI will be obey'd I tell youand chearfully tooor you are no child of mine  I wept  Let me beseech you my dear and everhonoured papa and I dropt down on my knees that I may have only your's and my mamma's will and not my brother's to obeyI was going on but he was pleased to withdraw leaving me on the floor saying That he would not hear me thus by subtilty and cunning aiming to distinguish away my duty repeating that he would be obey'd  My heart is too fullso full that it may endanger my duty were I to unburden it to you on this occasion So I will lay down my penBut canYet positively I will lay down my pen  LETTER IX Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Feb in the morning  MY aunt who staid here last night made me visit this morning as soon as it was light She tells me that I was left alone with my papa yesterday on purpose that he might talk with me on my expecte  obedience but that he own'd he was put beside his purpose by reflecting on something my brother had tol  him in my disfavour and by his impatience but to suppose that such a gentle spirit as mine had hitherto seem'd to be should presume to dispute his will in  oint where the advantage of the whole family was to  e so greatly promoted by my compliance  I find by a few words which dropt from her un+awares that they have all an absolute dependence upon what they suppose to be a meekness in my temper But in this they may be mistaken for I verily think upon a strict examination of myself that I have almost  as much in me of my father's as of my mother's family  My uncle Harlowe it seems is against driving me upon extremities But his unbrotherly nephew has engaged that the regard I have for my reputation and my principles will bring me  round to my duty  that's the expression Perhaps I shall have reason to wish I had not known this  My aunt advises me to submit for the present to the interdicts they have laid me under and indeed to encourage Mr Solmes's address I have absolutely refused the latter let what will as I have told her be the consequence The visiting prohibition I will conform to But as to that of not corresponding with you nothing but the menace that our letters shall be intercepted can engage my observation of it  She believes that this order is from my father without consulting my mother upon it And that purely as she supposes in consideration to me left I should mortally offend him and this from the incitements of  other  people meaning you and Miss Lloyd I make no doubt rather than by my own will For still as she tells me he speaks kind and praiseful things of me  Here is clemency Here is indulgenceAnd so it is To prevent a headstrong child as a good prince would wish to do disaffected subjects from running into rebellion and so forfeiting everything But this is all my brother's young man's wisdom a blotter without a head and a brother without a heart  How happy might I have been with any other brother in the world but Mr James Harlowe and with any other sister but  his  sister Wonder not my dear that I who used to chide you for these sort of liberties with my relations now am more undutiful than you ever were unkind I cannot bear the thought of being deprived of the principal pleasure of  my life for such is your conversation by person and by letter And who besides can bear to be made the dupe of such low cunning operating with such high and arrogant passions  But can you my dear Miss Howe condescend to carry on a private correspondence with me If you can there is one way I have thought of by which it may be done  You must remember the Green Lane as we call it that runs by the side of the woodhouse and poultryyard where I keep my bantams pheasants and peahens which generally engage my notice twice aday the more my favourites because they were my grandfather's and recommended to my care by him and therefore brought hither from my dairyhouse since his death  The lane is lower than the floor of the woodhouse and in the side of the woodhouse the boards are rotted away down to the floor for half an ell together in several places Hannah can step into the lane and make a mark with chalk where a letter or parcel may be push'd in under some sticks which may be so managed as to be an unsuspected cover for the written deposites from either  I HAVE been just now to look at the place and find it will answer So your faithful Robert may without coming near the house and as only passing thro' the green lane which leads to two or three farmhouses out of livery if you please very easily take from thence my letters and deposite yours  This place is the more convenient because it is seldom resorted to but by myself or Hannah on the abovementioned account for it is the general storehouse for firing the wood for constant use being nearer the house  One corner of this being separated off for the roostingplace of my little poultry either she or I shall never want a pretence to go thither  Try my dear the success of a letter this way and give me your opinion and advice what to do in this disgraceful situation as I cannot but call it and what you think of my prospects and what you would do in my case  But beforehand I must tell you that your advice must not run in favour of this Solmes And yet it is very likely they will endeavour to engage your mamma in order to induce you who have such an influence over me to favour him  Yet on second thoughts if you incline to that side of the question I would have you write your whole mind Determin'd as I think I am and cannot help it I would at least give a patient hearing to what may be said on the other side For my regards are not so much engag'd upon my word they are not I know not myself if they be to another person as some of my friends suppose and as you giveing way to your lively vein upon his last visits affected to suppose What preserable favour I may have for him to any other person is owing more to the usage he has received and for my sake borne than to any personal consideration  I write a few lines of grateful acknowlegement to your mamma for her favours to me in the late happy period I fear I shall never know such anotherI hope she will forgive me that I did not write sooner  The bearer if suspected and examin'd is to produce  that  as the only one he carries How do needless watchfulness and undue restraint produce artifice and contrivance I should abhor these clandestine correspondencies were they not forced upon me They have so mean so low an appearance to myself that I think I ought not to expect that you should take part in them  But why as I have also expostulated with my aunt must I be pushed into a state which altho' I reverence I have no wish to enter intoWhy should not my brother so many years older and so earnest to see me engaged be first engagedAnd if not so why not my sister be first provided for  But here I conclude these unavailing expostulations with the assurance that I am and ever will be  Your affectionate CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER X Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Febr  WHAT odd heads some people haveMiss Clarissa Harlowe to be sacrificed in marriage to Mr Roger Solmes Astonishing  I must not  you say  give my advice in favour of this man  You now halfconvince me my dear that you are ally'd to the family that could think of so preposterous a match or you could never have had the least notion of my advising in his favour  Ask me for his picture You know I have a good hand at drawing an ugly likeness But I'll see a little farther first For who knows what may happen since matters are in such a train and since you have not the  courage  to oppose so overwhelming a torrent  You ask me to help you to a little of my spirit Are you in earnest But it will not now I doubt do you serviceIt will not fit naturally upon you You are your mamma's girl think what you will and have violent spirits to contend with Alas my dear you should have borrowed some of mine a little soonerthat is to say before you had given the management of your estate into the hands of those who think they have a prior claim to it What tho'  a  father  'sHas not that father two elder childrenAnd do they not both bear his stamp and image more than you doPray my dear call me not to account for this free question lest your  application  of my meaning prove to be as severe as  that    Now I have launch'd out a little indulge me one word more in the same strain I will be decent I promise youI think you might have known that AVARICE and ENVY are two passions that are not to be satisfy'd the one by  giving  the other by the envied person's continuing to  deserve  and  excel  Fuel fuel both all the world over to flames insatiate and devouring  But since you ask for  my  opinion you must tell me all you know or surmise of  their  inducements And if you will not forbid me to make extracts from your letters for the entertainment of my cousin in the little island who longs to hear more of your affairs it will be very obliging  But you are so tender of some people who have no tenderness for any body but themselves that I must conjure you to speak out Remember that a friendship like ours admits of no reserves You may trust my impartiality It would be an affront to your own judgment if you did not For do you not  ask  my advice And have you not taught me that friendship should never give a bias against justiceJustify them therefore if you can Let us see if there be any  sense  whether sufficient  reason  or not in their choice At present I cannot and yet I know a good deal of your family have any conception how  all  of them your mamma in particular and your aunt Hervey can join with the rest against judgments given As to some of the others I cannot wonder at any thing they do or attempt to do where Self is concern'd  You ask Why may not your brother be first engag'd in wedlockI'll tell you why His temper and his arrogance are too well known to induce women he  would aspire to to receive his addresses notwithstanding his great independent acquisitions and still greater prospects Let me tell you my dear those acquisitions have given him more pride than reputation To me he is the most intolerable creature that I ever saw The treatment you blame he merited from one whom he would have addressed with the air of a person intending to confer rather than hoping to receive a favour I ever loved to mortify proud and insolent spirits What think you makes me bear Hickman near me but that the man is humble and knows his distance  As to your question Why your elder sister may not be first provided for I answer Because she must have no man but who has a great and clear estate that's one thing Another is Because she has a younger sisterPray my dear be so good as to tell me what man of a great and clear estate would think of that elder sister while the younger were single  You are all too rich to be happy child For must not each of you by the constitutions of your family marry to be  still  richer People who know in what their  main  excellence consists are not to be blam'd are they for cultivating and improving what they think most valuable Is true happiness any part of your familyviewSo far from it that none of your family but yourself could be happy were they not rich So let them fret on grumble and grudge and accumulate and wondering what ails them that they have not happiness when they have riches think the cause is want of more and so go on heaping up till death as greedy an accumulator as themselves gathers them into his garner  Well then once more I say do you my dear tell  me  what you know of their avowed and general motives and I will tell  you  more than you will tell  me  of their failings Your aunt Hervey you say  See p    has told  you  Why as I hinted above must I ask you to let  me know them when you condescend to ask my advice on the occasion  That they prohibit your corresponding with  me  is a wisdom I neither wonder at nor blame them for Since it is an evidence to me that they know their own folly And if they do is it strange that they should be afraid to trust another's judgment upon it  I am glad you have found out a way to correspond with me I approve it much I shall  more  if this first tryal of it proves successful But should it not and should it fall into their hands it would not concern me but for your sake  We had heard before you wrote that all was not right between your relations and you at your coming home That Mr Solmes visited you and that with a prospect of success But I concluded the mistake lay in the person and that his address was to Miss Arabella And indeed had she been as goodnatur'd as your plump ones generally are I should have thought her too good for him by halfThought I this  must  be the thing and my beloved friend is sent for to advise and assist in her nuptial preparations Who knows said I to my mamma but that when the man has thrown aside his yellow fullbuckled peruke and his broadbrimm'd beaver both of which I suppose were Sir Oliver's Best of long standing he may cut a tolerable figure dangling to church with Miss BellThe woman as she observes  should  excel the man in features And where can she match so well for a foil  I indulged this surmize against rumour because I could not believe that the absurdest people in England could be so  very  absurd as to think of this man for you  We heard moreover that you received no visitors I could assign no reason for this except that the preparations for your sister were to be private and the ceremony sudden Miss Lloyd and Miss Biddulph were with me to inquire what I knew of this and of  your not being at church either morning or afternoon the Sunday after your return from us to the disappointment of a little hundred of your admirers to use their words It was easy for me to guess the reason to be what you confirmTheir apprehensions that Lovelace would be there and attempt to wait on you home  My mamma takes very kindly your compliments in your letter to her Her words upon reading it were  'Miss Clarissa Harlowe is an admirable young lady Whereever she goes she confers a favour Whomever she leaves she fills with regret'  And then a little comparative reflection  'O my Nancy that you had a little of her sweet obligingness'  No matter The praise was yours You are me and I enjoy'd it The more enjoy'd it becauseshall I tell you the truthBecause I think myself as well as I amWere it but for this reason That had I twenty brother James's and twenty sister Bell's not one of them nor all of them join'd together would dare to treat me as yours presume to treat you The person who will bear much shall have much to bear all the world  hro' 'Tis your own sentiment grounded upon the strongest instance that can be given in your own family tho' you have so little improv'd by it  The result is this That I am fitter for  this  world than you You for the  next  than methat's the differenceBut long long for my sake and for hundreds of sakes may it be before you quit us for company more congenial and more worthy of you  I communicated to my mamma the account you give of your strange reception also what a horrid wretch they have found out for you and the compulsory treatment they give you It only set her on magnifying her lenity to me on my  tyrannical  behaviour as she  will  call it mothers must have their way you know to the man she so warmly recommends against whom it seems there can be no just exception  and expatiating upon the complaisance I owe her for her indulgence So I believe I must communicate to her nothing fartherespecially as I know she would condemn the correspondence between us and That between you and Lovelace as a clandestine and undutiful thing For  duty implicit  is her cry And moreover she lends a pretty open ear to the preachments of that starch old bachelor your uncle Antony and for an example to  her  daughter would be more careful how she takes your part be the cause ever so just Yet is not this right policy neither For people who will allow nothing will be granted nothing In other words those who aim at carrying too many points will not be able to carry any  But can you divine my dear what that old preachmentmaking plumphearted soul your uncle Antony means by his frequent amblings hitherThere is such smirking and smiling between my mamma and him Such mutual praises of oeconomy and  '  That  is my way'  and  '  This  I do'  and  'I am glad it has  your  approbation Sir'  and  '  You  look into every thing Madam'    'Nothing would be done if I  did not  '  Such exclamations against servants Such exaltings of selfAnd  dearheart  and  goodlack  and '  lasaday  And now and then their conversation sinking into a whispering accent if  I  come cross themI'll tell you my dear I don't above half like it  Only that these old bachelors usually take as many years to resolve upon matrimony as they can reasonably expect to live or I should be ready to fire upon his visits and recommend Mr Hickman as a much properer man to my mamma's acceptance For what he wants in years he makes up in gravity And if you will not chide me I will say That there is a primness in  both  especially when the man has presumed too much with me upon my mamma's favour for him and is under discipline on that account as  makes them seem near of kin And then in contemplation of my sauciness and what they both bear from it they sigh awayand seem so mightily to compassionate each other that if Pity be but one remove from Love I am in no danger while they both are in a great deal and don't know it  Now my dear I know you will be upon me with your grave airs  So in for the lamb  as the saying is  in for the sheep  and do you yourself look about you For I'll have a pull with you by way of being aforehand Hannibal we read always advised to attack the Romans upon their own territories  You are pleased to say and  upon your word too  That your  regards  a mighty quaint word for  affections are not so much engag'd as some of your friends suppose to another person  What need you give one to imagine my dear that the last month or two has been a period extremely favourable to that  other  personwhom it has made an obliger of the niece for his patience with the uncles  But to p  ss that by  So much  engag'd  How much  my dear Shall I infer  Some of your friends  suppose  a great deal  You seem to own  a little    Don't be angry It is all fair Because you have not acknowleg'd to me That  little  People I have heard you say who affect secrets always excite curiosity  But you proceed with a kind of drawback upon your averrment as if recollection had given you a doubt  You know not yourself if they be  so much engag'd Was it necessary to say This to meand to say it  upon your word  tooBut you know bestYet you don't neither I believe For a beginning Love is acted by a subtile spirit and oftentimes discovers itself to a bystander when the person possess'd why should I not call it  possess'd  knows not it has such a demon  But further you say What PREFERABLE  favour  you may have for him to any other person is owing more to the usage he has received and for your sake borne than to any personal consideration    This is generously said It is in character But O my friend depend upon it you are in danger Depend upon it whether you know it or not you are a little in for't Your native generosity and greatness of mind indanger you All your friends by fighting  against  him with impolitic violence fight  for him  And Lovelace my life for yours notwithstanding all his veneration and assiduities has seen further than that veneration and those assiduities so well calculated to your meridian will let him own he has seenHas seen in short that his work is doing for him more effectually than he could do it for himself And have you not before now said That nothing is so penetrating as the vanity of a lover since it makes the person who has it frequently see in his own favour what is  not  and hardly ever fail of observing what  is  And who says Lovelace wants vanity  In short my dear it is my opinion and that from the easiness of his heart and behaviour that he has seen more than  I  have seen more than you think  could  be seenmore than I believe you  yourself  know or else you would have let  me  know it  Already in order to restrain him from resenting the indignities he has received and which are daily offer'd him he has prevailed upon you to correspond with him privately I know he has nothing to boast of from  what  you have written But is not his inducing you to receive his letters and to answer them a great point gain'dBy your insisting that he should keep this correspondence private it appears that there is  one secret  that you do not wish the world should know And  he  is master of that secret He is indeed  himself  as I may say that secretWhat an intimacy does this beget for the loverHow is it distancing the parent  Yet who as things are situated can blame youYour condescension has no doubt hitherto prevente  great mischiefs It must be continued for the sam  reasons while the cause remains You are draw  in by a perverse fate against inclination But custom with such laudable purposes will reconcile the inconveniency and  make  an inclinationAnd I would advise you as you would wish to manage on an occasion so critical with that prudence which governs all your actions not to be afraid of entering upon a close examination into the true springs and grounds of this your  generosity  to that happy man  It is my humble opinion I tell you frankly that on inquiry it will come out to be LOVEDon't start my dearHas not your man himself had natural philosophy enough to observe already to your aunt Hervey that Love takes the deepest root in the steadiest minds The duce take his sly penetration I was going to say for this was six or seven weeks ago  I  have been tinctured you know Nor on the coolest reflection could I account how and when the jaundice began But had been over head and ears as the saying is but for some of that advice from you which I now return you Yet  my  man was not half soSo  what  my dearTo be sure Lovelace is a charming fellowAnd were he onlyBut I will not make you  glow  as you readUpon  my word  I won'tYet my dear don't you find at your heart somewhat unusual make it go throb throb throb as you read just hereIf you do don't be asham'd to own itIt is your  generosity  my love that's allBut as the Roman augur said Caesar beware of the ides of March  Adieu my dearest friend and forgive and very speedily by the newfound expedient tell me that you forgive  Your everaffectionate ANNA HOWE  LETTER XI Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Wednesday March  YOU both nettled and alarmed me my dearest Miss Howe by the concluding part of your last At first reading it I did not think it necessary said I to myself to guard against a critic when I was writeing to so dear a friend But then recollecting myself Is there not more in it said I than the result of a vein so naturally lively Surely I must have been guilty of an inadvertenceLet me enter into the close examination of myself which my beloved friend advises  I did so and cannot own any of the  glow  any of the  throbs  you mention  Upon my word  I will repeat I cannot And yet the passages in my letter upon which you are so humourously severe lay me fairly open to your agreeable rail  ery I own they do And I cannot tell what turn my mind had taken to dictate so oddly to my pen  ButpraynowIs it saying so much when one who has no very particular regard to  any  man says There are  some  who are preferable to  others  And is it blameable to say  Those  are the preferable who are not well used by one's relations yet dispense with that usage out of regard to one's self which they would otherwise resent Mr Lovelace for instance I may be allow'd to say is a man to be preferr'd to Mr Solmes and that I  do  prefer him to that man But surely this may be said without its being a necessary consequence that one must be in love with him  Indeed I would not be  in love  with him as it is called for the world First because I have no opinion of his morals and think it a fault in which our whole family my brother excepted has had a share  that he was permitted to visit us with a hope which however being distant did not as I have observed heretofore intitle any of us to call him to account for such of his immoralities as came to our ears Next because I think him to be a vain man capable of triumphing secretly at least over a person whose heart he thinks he has engaged And thirdly because the assiduities and veneration which you impute to him seem to carry an haughtiness in them as if his address had a merit in it that would be an equivalent for a lady's favour In short he seems to me so to behave when most unguarded as if he thought himself above the very politeness which his birth and education perhaps therefore more than his choice oblige him to shew In other words his very politeness appears to me to be constrained and with the most remarkably easy and genteel  person  something seems to be behind in his  manner  that is too studiously kept in Then goodhumour'd as he is thought to be in the main to  other peoples  servants and this even to familiarity altho' as you have observ'd a familiarity that has dignity in it not unbecoming a man of quality he is apt sometimes to break out into passion with  his own  An oath or a curse follows and such looks from those servants as plainly shew terror and that they should have far'd worse had they not been in my hearing With a confirmation in the master's looks of a surmize too well justify'd  Indeed my dear THIS man is not THE man I have great objections to him My heart  throbs  not after him I  glow  not but with indignation against myself for having given room for such an imputationBut you must not my dearest friend construe common Gratitude into Love I cannot bear that you should But if ever I should have the misfortune to think it Love I promise you  upon my word  which is the same as  upon my honour  that I will acquaint you with it  You bid me to tell you very speedily and by the newfound expedient that I am not displeased with you for your agreeable raillery I dispatch this therefore immediately postponing to my next the account of the inducements which my friends have to promote with so much earnestness the address of Mr Solmes  Be satisfy'd my dear mean time that I am  not  displeased with you Indeed I am not On the contrary I give you my hearty thanks for your friendly premonitions And I charge you as I have often done that if you observe any thing in me so very faulty as would require from you to others in my behalf the palliation of friendly and partial love you acquaint me with it For methinks I would  o conduct myself as not to give reason even for an  adversary  to censure me And how shall so weak and so young a creature avoid the censure of such if my  friend  will not hold a lookingglass before me to let me see my imperfections  Judge me then my dear as any indifferent person knowing what  you  know of me would doI may  t first be a little pained may  glow  a little perhaps  o be found less worthy of your friendship than I wish  o be but assure yourself that your kind correction will give me reflection that shall  amend  me If it do not you will have a fault to accuse me of that will be utterly  in  excusable A fault let me add that should you  not  accuse me of it if in your opinion I am guilty you will not be so much so  warmly  my friend as I am yours who have never spar'd you you know my dear on the like occasions  Here I break off to begin another letter to you with the assurance mean time that I am and ever will be  Your equally affectionate and grateful CL HARLOWE  LETTER XII Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Thursday Morn March  INdeed you would not be in love with him for the world  Your servant my dear Nor would I have you For I think with all the advantages of person fortune and family he is not by any means worthy of you And this opinion I give as well from the reasons you mention which I cannot but confirm a  from what I have heard of him but a few hours ago from Mrs Fortescue a favourite of lady Betty Lawrance who knows him wellBut let me congratulate you however on your being the first of our se  that ever I heard of who has been able to turn th  lion Love at her own pleasure into a lapdog  Well but if you have not the throbs and the glow  you have not And are not in love good reaso  whybecause you would not be in love and there'  no more to be saidOnly my dear I shall keep good lookout upon you and so I hope you wi  upon yourself For it is no manner of argument th  because you would not be in love you are notB  before I part intirely with this subject a word in you  ear my charming friend'Tis only by way of cau+tion and in pursuance of the general observation th  a standerby is often a better judge of the game th  those that playMay it not be that you have had and have such cross creatures and such odd head to deal with as have not allow'd you to attend t  the throbsOr if you had them a little now an  then whether having had two accounts to pla  them to you have not by mistake put them to th  wrong one  But whether you have a value for this Lovelace  not I know you'll be impatient to hear what Mr  Fortescue has said of him Nor will I keep you longer in suspense  An hundred wild stories she tells of him from childhood to manhood for as she observes having never been subject to contradiction he was always as mischievous as a monkey But I shall pass over these whole hundred of his puerile rogueries altho'  indicative  ones as I may say to take notice as well of some things you are not quite ignorant of as of others you know not and to make a few observations upon him and his ways  Mrs Fortescue owns what everybody knows that he is notoriously nay avowedly a man of pleasure yet says that in any thing he sets his heart upon or undertakes he is the most industrious and persevering mortal under the sun He rests it seems not above six hours in the twentyfour any more than you He delights in writing Whether at his Uncle's or at Lady Betty's or Lady Sarah's he has always when he retires a pen in his fingers One of his companions confirming his love of writing has told her that his thoughts flow rapidly to his pen And you and I my dear have observed on more occasions than one that tho' he writes even a fine hand he is one of the readiest and quickest of writers He must indeed have had early a very docile genius since a person of his pleasurable turn and active spirit could never have submitted to take long or great pains in  ttaining the qualifications he is master of qualifications so seldom attainable by youth of quality and fortune by such especially of those of either who like him have never known what it was to be controuled  He had once the vanity upon being complimented  n these talents and on his surprising diligence for a man of pleasure to compare himself to Julius Cae  ar who perform'd great actions by day and wrote them down at night And valued himself that he  only wanted Caesar's outsetting to make a figure among his cotemporaries  He spoke this indeed she says with an air o  pleasantry For she observed and so have we th  he has the art of acknowleging his vanity with s  much humour that it sets him above the contemp  which is due to vanity and selfopinion and at the same time halfpersuades those who he  r him that h  really deserves the exaltation he gives himself  But supposing it to be true that all his vacan  nightly hours are imploy'd in writing what can be hi  subjects If like Caesar his own actions he must u  doubtedly be a very enterprising and very wicked man since nobody suspects him to have a serious turn And decent as he is in his conversation with us hi  writings are not probably such as will redound eithe  to his own honour or to the benefit of others we  they to be read He must be conscious of this fin  Mrs Fortescue says that in the great correspond+ence by letters which he holds he is as secret a  careful as if it were of a treasonable naturey  troubles not his head with politics tho' no bod  knows the interests of princes and courts better th  he  That you and I my dear should love to write no wonder We have always from the time eac  could hold a pen delighted in epistolary correspond+encies Our employments are domestic and sede  +tary and we can scribble upon twenty innocent sub+jects and take delight in them because they  are  inno+cent tho' were they to be seen they might n  much profit or please others But that such a ga  lively young fellow as this who rides hunts tr  +vels frequents the public entertainments and h  means  to pursue his pleasures should be able to set him+self down to write for hours together as you and have heard him say he frequently does that is  strange thing  Mrs Fortescue says that he is a complete master of shorthand writing By the way what inducements could such a swift writer as he have to learn shorthand  She says and we know it as well as she that he has a surprising memory and a very lively imagination  Whatever his other vices are all the world as well as Mrs Fortescue say he is a sober man And among all his bad qualities  gaming  that great waster of time as well as fortune is not his vice So that he must have his head as cool and his reason as clear as the prime of youth and his natural gaiety will permit and by his early morning hours a great portion of time upon his hands to employ in writing or worse  Mrs Fortescue says he has one gentleman who is more his intimate and correspondent than any of the rest You remember what his dismiss'd bailiff said of him and of his associates I don't find but that man's character of him was in general pretty just Mrs Fortescue confirms this part of it that all his relations are afraid of him and that his pride sets him above owing obligations to them She believes he is clear of the world and that he will continue so No doubt from the same motive that makes him avoid being oblig'd to his relations  A person willing to think favourably of him would hope that a  brave  a  learned  and a  diligent  man cannot be  naturally  a  bad  manBut if he be better than his enemies say he is and if worse he is bad indeed he is guilty of an inexcusable fault in being so careless as he is of his reputation I think a man can be so but from one of these two reasons Either that he is conscious he deserves the evil spoken of him or that he takes a pride in being thought worse than he isBoth very bad and threatening indications Since the first must shew him to be utterly abandon'd and it is but natural to conclude from the other that what a man is not asham'd to have imputed to him he will  not scruple to be guilty of whenever he has opportunity  Upon the whole and upon all that I could gather from Mrs Fortescue Mr Lovelace is a very faulty man You and I have thought him too gay too inconsiderate too rash too little an hypocrite to be  deep  You see he never would disguise his natural temper haughty as it certainly is with respect to your brother's behaviour to him Where he thinks a contempt due he pays it to the uttermost Nor has he complaisance enough to spare your uncles  But were he deep and ever so deep you would soon penetrate him if they would leave you to yourself His vanity would be your clue Never man had more Yet as Mrs Fortescue observed never did man carry it off so happily There is a strange mixture in it of humourous vivacityFor but one half of what he says of himself when he is in the vein any other man would be insufferable  TALK  of the devil  is an old sayingThe lively wretch has made me a visit and is but just gone away He is all impatience and resentment at the treatment you meet with and full of apprehensions too that they will carry their point with you  I told him my opinion that you will never be brought to think of such a man as Solmes but that i  will probably end in a composition never to have either  No man he said whose fortunes and alliances are so considerable ever had so little favour from a lady for whose sake he had borne so much  I told him my mind as freely as I used to do But who ever was in fault Self being judge He complain'd of spies set upon his conduct and to pry into his life and morals and this by your brother and uncles  I told him that this was very hard upon him and the more so as neither the one nor the other perhaps would stand a fair inquiry  He smiled and called himself  my servant  The occasion was too fair he said for Miss Howe who never spared him to let it passBut Lord help their shallow souls would I believe it they were for turning plotters upon  him  They had best take care he did not pay them in their own coin Their  hearts  were better turn'd for such works than their  heads    I asked him if he valued himself upon having a head better turn'd than theirs for  such works  as he call'd them  He drew off And then ran into the highest professions of reverence and affection for you The object so meritorious who can doubt the reality of his professions  Adieu my dearest my noble friendI love and admire you for the generous conclusion of your last more than I can express Tho' I began this letter with impertinent raillery knowing that you always loved to indulge my mad vein yet never was there a heart that more glowed with friendly love than that of  Your own ANNA HOWE  LETTER XIII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Wedn March  I NOW take up my pen to lay before you the inducements and motives which my friends have to espouse so earnestly the address of this Mr Solmes  In order to set this matter in a clear light it is necessary to go a little backward and even perhaps to mention some things which you already know And so you may look upon what I am going to relate  as a kind of supplement to my letters of the th and th of January last  In those letters of which I have kept memorandums I gave you an account of my brother's and sister's implacableness to Mr Lovelace and the methods they took so far as they had then come to my knowlege to ruin him in the opinion of my other friends And I told you that after a very cold yet not a directly affrontive behaviour to him they all of a  sudden  See Letter  iv  p    became more violent and proceeded to personal insults which brought on at last the unhappy rencounter between my brother and him  Now you must know that from the last conversation which passed between my aunt and me  comes out that this  sudden  vehemence on my brother's and sister's parts was owing to stronger reasons than to the collegebegun antipathy on his side or t  slighted love on hers to wit to an apprehensio  that my uncles intended to follow my grandfather'  example in my favour at least in a higher degree that they wish they should An apprehension founded i  seems on a conversation between my two uncles an  my brother and sister which my aunt communicated to me in confidence as an argument to prevail upon me to accept of Mr Solmes's  noble  settlements urging that such a seasonable compliance would frustrate my brother's and sister's views and establish me for eve  in the opinion and love of my father and uncles  I will give you the substance of this communicate  conversation after I have made a brief introductory observation or two Which however I hardly need to make to you who are so well acquainted with  all did not the series or thread of the story require it  I have more than once mentioned to you the darling view some of us have long had of  raising a family  as it is called A reflection as I have often thought upon our own which is no inconsiderable or upsta  one on either side Of my mamma's especiallyA view too frequently it seems entertained by families which having great substance cannot be satisfy'd without rank and title  My uncles had once extended this view to each of us three children urging that as they themselves intended not to marry we each of us might be so portion'd and so advantageously matched as that our posterity if not ourselves might make a first figure in our countryWhile my brother as the only son thought the two girls might be very well provided for by ten or fifteen thousand pounds apiece And that all the real estates in the family to wit my grandfather's father's and two uncles and the remainder of their respective personal estates together with what he had an expectancy of from his godmother would make such a noble fortune and give him such an interest as might intitle him to hope for a peerage Nothing less would satisfy his ambition  With this view he gave himself airs very early  'That his grandfather and uncles were his stewards That no man ever had better That daughters were but incumbrances and drawbacks upon a family'  And  this  low and familiar expression was often in his mouth and utter'd always with the selfcomplaisance which an imagin'd happy thought can be supposed to give the speaker to wit  'That a man who has sons brings up chickens for his own table'  tho' once I made his comparison stagger with him by asking him If the sons to make it hold were to have their necks wrung off 'whereas daughters are chickens brought up for the tables of other men' This accompanied with the equally polite reflection  'That to induce people to take them off their hands the familystock must be impaired into the bargain'  used to put my sister out of all patience And altho'  he now seems to think a  younger  sister only can be an incumbrance she was then often proposing to me  to make a party in our own favour against my brother's  rapacious views  as she used to call them While I was for considering the liberties he took of this sort as the effect of a temporary pleasantry which in a young man not naturally goodhumour'd I was glad to see or as a foible that deserv'd raillery but no other notice  But when my grandfather's will of the purport of which in my particular favour until it was open'd I was as ignorant as they had lopp'd off one branch of my brother's expectation he was extremely dissatisfy'd with me Nobody indeed was pleased For altho' everyone loved me yet being the youngest child father uncles brother sister all thought themselves postpon'd as to matter of right and power Who loves not power And my father himself could not bear that I should be made sole as I may call it and independent for such the will as to that estate and the powers it gave unaccountably as they all said made me  To obviate therefore everyone's jealousy I gave up to my father's management as you know not only the estate but the money bequeathed me which was a moiety of what my grandfather had by him at his death the other moiety being bequeathed to my sister contenting myself to take as from his bounty what he was pleased to allow me without desiring the least addition to my annual stipend And then I hoped I had laid all envy asleep But still my brother and sister jealous as now is evident of my two uncles favour for me and of the pleasure I had given my father and them by this act of duty were everynowandthen occasionally doing me covert ill offices Which I took the less notice of having as I imagin'd removed the cause of their envy and imputed every thing of that sort to the petulance they are both pretty much noted for  My brother's acquisition then took place This made us all very happy and he went down to take possession of it And his absence on so good an account too made us still happierThen follow'd Lord M's proposal for my sister And this was an additional felicity for the time I have told you how exceedingly goodhumour'd it made my sister  You know how that went off You know what came on in its place  My brother then return'd and we were all wrong again And Bella as I observ'd in my letters abovemention'd had an opportunity to give herself the credit of having refused Mr Lovelace on the score of his reputed faulty morals This united my brother and sister in one cause They set themselves on all occasions to depreciate Mr Lovelace and his  family  too a family which deserves nothing but respect And this gave rise to the conversation I am leading to between my uncles and them Of which I now come to give the particulars after I have observed that it happen'd before the rencounter and soon after the inquiry made into Mr Lovelace's affairs had come out better than my brother and sister hoped or expected  See Letter  iv  p      They were bitterly inveighing against him in their usual way strengthening their invectives with some new stories in his disfavour when my uncle Antony having given them a patient hearing declar'd  'That he thought the gentleman behav'd like a gentleman his niece Clary with prudence and that a more honourable alliance for the family  as he had often told them  could not be wished for Since Mr Lovelace had a very good paternal estate and that by the evidence of an enemy all clear Nor did it appear that he was so bad a man as had been represented Wild indeed but it was at a gay time of life He was a man of sense And he was sure that his niece would not have him if she had not good reason to  think him reform'd or by her own example likely to be so'  He then gave one instance my aunt told me as a proof of a generosity in his spirit which shew'd him he said to be no very bad man in nature and of a temper he was pleased to say like my own Which was that when he my uncle had represented to him that he might if he pleased as he had heard Lord M say make three or four hundred pounds a year of his paternal estate more than he did he answer'd  'That his tenants paid their rents well That it was a maxim with his family from which he would by no means depart never to rackrent old tenants or their descendants and that it was a pleasure to him to see all his tenants look fat sleek and contented'  I indeed had once occasionally heard him say something like this and thought he never looked so well as at the timeexcept once on this occasion  An unhappy tenant came petitioning to my uncle Antony for forbearance in Mr Lovelace's presence When he had fruitlesly withdrawn Mr Lovelace pleaded his cause so well that the man was called in again and had his suit granted And Mr Lovelace privately follow'd him out and gave him two guineas for present relief the man having declared that at the time he had not five shillings in the world  On this occasion he told my uncle of the good action I hinted at and that without any ostentatious airs to wit That he had once observed an old tenant and his wife in a very mean habit at church and questioning them about it next day as he knew they had no hard bargain in their farm the man said he had done some very foolish things with a good intention which had put him behindhand and he could not have paid his rent and appear better He asked him how long it would take him to retrieve the foolish step he had made He said perhaps two or three years Well then said he I will abate you five pounds  a year for seven years provided you will lay it out upon your wife and self that you may make a Sunday appearance  like  MY  tenants  Mean time take This putting his hand in his pocket and giving him five guineas to put yourselves in present plight and let me see you next Sunday at church hand in hand like an honest and loving couple and I bespeak you to dine with me afterwards  Altho' this pleased me when I heard it as giving an instance of generosity and prudence at the same time not lessening as my uncle took notice the yearly value of the farm yet my dear I had no  throbs  no  glows  upon it  upon my word  I had not Nevertheless I own to you that I could not help saying to myself on the occasion  'Were it ever to be my lot to have this man he would not hinder me from pursuing the methods I so much delight to take'  With  'A pity that such a man were not  uniformly  good'  Forgive me this digression  My uncle went on my aunt told me  'That besides his paternal estate he was the immediate heir to very splendid fortunes That when he was in treaty for his niece Arabella Lord M told him what great things he and his two halfsisters intended to do for him in order to qualify him for the title which would be extinct at his Lordship's death and which they hoped to procure for him or a still higher that of those Ladies father which had been for some time extinct on failure of heirs male That this view made his relations so earnest for his marrying That as he saw not where Mr Lovelace could better himself so truly he thought there was wealth enough in their own family to build up three considerable ones That therefore he must needs say he was the more desirous of this alliance as there was a great probability not only from Mr Lovelace's descent but from his fortunes that his niece  Clarissa might one day be a peeress of Great BritainAnd upon that prospect  here was the mortifying stroke  he should for his own part think it not wrong to make such dispositions as should contribute to the better support of the dignity'  My uncle Harlowe it seems far from disapproving of what his brother had said declar'd  'That there was but one objection to an alliance with Mr Lovelace to wit his morals Especially as so much could be done for Miss Bella and for my brother too by my father and as my brother was actually possessed of a considerable estate by virtue of the deed of gift and will of his godmother Lovell'  Had I known this before I should the less have wonder'd at many things I have been unable to account for in my brother's and sister's behaviour to me and been more on my guard than I imagin'd there was a necessity to be  You may easily guess how much this conversation affected my brother at the time He could not you know but be very uneasy to hear  two of his stewards  talk at this rate to his face  He had from early days by his violent temper made himself both feared and courted by the whole family My father himself as I have lately mentioned very often long before his acquisitions had made him still more assuming gave way to him as to an only son who was to build up the name and augment the honour of it Little inducement therefore had he to correct a temper which gave him so much consideration with everybody  'See sister Bella' said he in an indecent passion before my uncles on the occasion I have mention'd  'See how it isYou and I ought to look about usThis little Syren is in a fair way to  outuncle  as well as  outgrandfather  us both'  From this time as I now find it plain upon recollection did my brother and sister behave to me as to  one who stood in their way sometimes as to a creature in love with their common enemy and to each other as having but one interest And were resolved therefore to bend all their force to hinder an alliance from taking effect which they believed was likely to oblige them to contract their views  And how was this to be done after such a declaration from both my uncles  My brother found out the way My sister as I have said went hand in hand with him Between them the family union was broken and everyone was made uneasy Mr Lovelace was received more and more coldly by all But not being to be put out of his course by slights  only  personal affronts succeeded defiances next then the rencounter That as you have heard did the business And now if I do not oblige them my grandfather's estate is to be litigated with me and I who never designed to take advantage of the independency bequeathed me  am to be as dependent upon my papa's will as a daughter ought to be who knows not what is good for herself  This is the language of the family now  But if I will suffer myself to be prevailed upon how happy as  they  lay it out shall we all beSuch presents am I to have such jewels and I cannot not tell what from every one of the family Then Mr Solmes's fortunes are so great and his proposals so very advantageous no relation whom he values that there will be abundant room to raise mine upon them were the highintended favours of my own relations to be quite out of the question Moreover it is now with this view found out that I have qualifications which of  themselves  will be a full equivalent to him for the settlements he is to make me and leave  him  as well as  them  under an obligation to me for my compliance He himself thinks so I am told so very poor a creature is he even in  his own  as well as in  their  eyes  These charming views answer'd how rich how splendid shall we all three be And Iwhat obligations shall I lay upon them allAnd that only by doing an act of duty so suitable to my character and manner of thinkingif indeed I am the generous as well as dutiful creature I have hitherto made them believe I am  This is the bright side that is turn'd to my father and uncles to captivate them But I am afraid that my brother's and sister's design is to ruin me with them at any rate Were it otherwise would they not on my return from you have rather sought to court than frighten me into measures their hearts are so much bent to carry A method they have followed ever since  Mean time orders are given to all the servants to shew the highest respect to Mr Solmes the  generous  Mr Solmes is now his character with some of our family But are not these orders a tacit confession that they think his own merit will not procure him respect He is accordingly in every visit he makes not only highlycaressed by the principals of our family but obsequiously attended and cring'd to by the menialsAnd  the noble settlements  are echoed from every mouth  Noble  is the word used to inforce the offers of a man who is mean enough avowedly to  hate  and wicked enough to propose to  rob  of their just expectations his own family every one of which at the same time stands in too much need of his favour in order to settle all he is worth upon me and if I die without children and he has none by any other marriage  pon a family which already abounds Such are his proposals  But were there no other motive to induce me to despise the upstart man is not this unjust one to his family enoughThe  upstart man  I repeat for he was not born to the immense riches he is possessed of  Riches left by one niggard to another in injury to the next heir because that other is a niggard And should I not be as culpable do you think in my acceptance of such unjust settlements as he in the offer of them if I could persuade myself to be a sharer in them or suffer a reversionary expectation of possessing them to influence my choice  Indeed it concerns me not a little that my friends could be brought to encourage such offers on  such  motives as I think a person of conscience should not presume to begin the world with  But this it seems is the only method that can be taken to disappoint Mr Lovelace and at the same time to answer all my relations have to wish for each of us And  sure  I will not stand against such an accession to the family as may happen from marrying Mr Solmes Since now a  possibility  is discover'd which such a grasping mind as my brother's can easily turn into a  probability  that my grandfather's estate will revert to it with a much more considerable one of the man's own Instances of estates falling in in cases far more unlikely than this are insisted on and my sister says in the words of an old saw  It is good to be related to an estate    While Solmes smiling no doubt to himself at a hope so remote by  offers  only obtains all their interests and doubts not to join to his own the estate I am envied for which for the conveniency of its situation between two of his will it seems be of twice the value to him that it would be of to any other person and is therefore I doubt not a stronger motive with him than the wife  These my dear seem to me the principal inducements of my relations to espouse so vehemently as they do this man's suit And here once more must I deplore the familyfault which gives those inducements such a force as it will be difficult to resist  And thus far let matters with regard to Mr Solmes and me come out as they will my brother has succeeded in his views that is to say he has in the first place got my FATHER to make the cause his own and to insist upon my compliance as an act of duty  My MAMMA has never thought fit to oppose my father's will when once he has declar'd himself determin'd  My UNCLES stiff unbroken highlyprosperous bachelors give me leave to say tho' very worthy gentlemen in the main have as high notions of a child's duty as of a wife's obedience in the  last  of which my mamma's meekness has confirm'd them and given them greater reason to expect the  first    My aunt HERVEY not extremely happy in her own nuptials and perhaps under some little obligation is got over and chooses not to open her lips in my favour against the wills of a father and uncles so determin'd  This passiveness in her and in my mamma in a point so contrary to their own first judgments is too strong a proof that my papa is absolutely resolv'd  Their tre  tment of my worthy Mrs NORTON is a sad confirmation of it A woman deserving of all consideration for her wisdom and everybody thinking so but who not being wealthy enough to have due weight in a point against which she has given her opinion and which they seem bent upon carrying is restrain'd from visiting here and even from corresponding with me as I am this very day inform'd  Hatred to Lovelace family aggrandizement and this great motive  paternal authority  What a force  united  when  singly  each consideration is sufficient to carry all before it  This is the formidable appearance which the address of this disagreeable man wears at present  My BROTHER and my SISTER triumph  They have got me down  is their expression as Hannah overhearing  them tells me And so they have yet I never knew that I was insolently  up  for now my brother will either lay me under an obligation to comply to my own unhappiness and so make me an instrument of his revenge upon Lovelace or if I refuse throw me into disgrace with my whole family  Who will wonder at the intrigues and plots carried on by undermining courtiers against one another when a private family but three of which can possibly have clashing interests and one of them as she presumes to think above such low motives cannot be free from them  What at present most concerns me is the peace of my mamma's mind How can the husband of  such  a wife a  good  man tooBut oh this prerogative of manhood be so  posi  tive so unper  suade  able to one who has brought into the family means which they know so well the value of that methinks they should value  her  the more for  their  sake  They do indeed value her But I am sorry to say she has purchased that value by her compliances Yet has merit for which she ought to be venerated prudence which ought of itself to be trusted and conformed to in everything  But whither roves my pen How dare a perverse girl take these liberties with relations so very respectable and whom she highly respectsWhat an unhappy situation is that which obliges her in her  own defence  as it were to expose  their  failings  But you who know how much I love and reverence my mamma will judge what a difficulty I am under to be obliged to oppose a scheme which she has engaged in Yet I  must  oppose it to comply is impossible and must declare without delay my opposition or my difficulties will increase since as I am just now inform'd a lawyer has been this very day consulted would you have believ'd it in relation to settlements  Were ours a RomanCatholic family how much happier for me that they thought a Nunnery would answer all their viewsHow happy had not a certain person slighted somebody All then would have been probably concluded on between them before my brother had arrived to thwart the match Then had I had a sister which now I have not and two brothersboth aspiring possibly both titled While I should only have valued that in either which is above title that which is truly noble in both  But what longreaching selfishness is my brother govern'd by By what remote exceedingly remote viewsViews which it is in the power of the slightest accident of a fever for instance the seeds of which are always vegetating as I may say and ready to burst forth in his own impetuous temper or of the provoked weapon of an adversary to blow up and destroy  I will break off here Let me write ever so freely of my friends I am sure of  your  kind construction And I confide in your discretion that you will avoid reading to or transcribing for others such passages as may have the appearance of treating too freely the parental or even the fraternal character or induce others to censure for a supposed failure in duty to the one or decency to the other  Your truly affectionate CL HARLOWE  LETTER XIV Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Thursday Evening March  ON Hannah's depositing my long letter begun yesterday but by reason of several interruptions not finish'd till within this hour she found and brought me yours of this day I thank you my dear for this  kind expeditionThese few lines will perhaps be time enough deposited to be taken away by your servant with the others Yet they are only to thank you and to tell you my increasing apprehensions  I must beg or seek the occasion to apply to my mamma for her mediationfor I am in danger of having a day fixed and antipathy taken for bashfulnessShould not sisters be sisters to each other Should they not make a common cause of it as I may say a cause of sex on such occasions as the present Yet mine in support of my brother's selfishness and no doubt in concert with him has been urging in full assembly as I am told and that with an earnestness peculiar to herself when she sets upon any thing that an absolute day be given me and if I comply not to be told that it shall be to the forfeiture of all my fortunes and of all their loves  She need not be so officious My brother's interest without hers is strong enough for he has found means to confederate all the family against me Upon some fresh provocation or new intelligence concerning Mr Lovelace I know not what it is they have bound themselves or are to bind themselves by a sign'd paper to one another the Lord bless me my dear what shall I do to carry this point of Mr Solmes in support of my father's authority as it is called and against Lovelace as a libertine and an enemy to the family And if so I am sure I may say against  me  How impolitic in them all to join two people in one interest whom they wish for ever to keep asunder  What the discharg'd steward reported of him was bad enough What Mrs Fortescue said not only confirms that bad but gives room to think him still worseAnd something my friends have come at which as Betty Barnes tells Hannah is of so heinous a nature that it proves him to be the worst of menBut hang the man I had almost saidwhat is he to me  What  would  he bewere not this Mr SolO my dear how I hate that man in the light he is proposed to meAll of them at the same time afraid of Mr Lovelaceyet not afraid to provoke himHow am I intangledto be obliged to go on corresponding with him for  their  sakesHeaven forbid that their persistedin violence should so drive me as to make it necessary for  my own  But surely  they  will yieldIndeed  I  cannotI believe the gentlest spirits when provoked causlesly and cruelly provoked are the most determin'dThe reason may be That not taking up resolutions lightly their very deliberation makes them the more immoveableAnd then when a point is clear and selfevident to everybody one cannot without impatience think of entering into an argument or contention upon it  An interruption obliges me to conclude myself in some hurry as well as fright what I must ever be  Yours more than my own CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER XV Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Friday March  I HAVE both your letters at once It is very unhappy my dear since your friends will have you marry that such a merit as yours should be addressed by a succession of worthless creatures who have nothing but their presumption for their excuse  That these presumers appear not in this very unworthy light to some of your friends is because their defects are not so striking to them as to othersAnd why Shall I venture to tell youBecause they are nearer their own standard  Modesty  after all perhaps has a concern in it for how should they think  that a  niece  or a  sister  of  theirs  I will not go higher for fear of incurring your displeasure should be an angelBut where indeed is the man to be found who has the least share of due diffidence that dares to look up to Miss Clarissa Harlowe with hope or with any thing but wishes Thus the bold and forward not being sensible of their defects aspire while the modesty of the really worthy fills them with too much reverence to permit them to explain themselves Hence your Symmes's your Byron's your Mullins's your Wyerley's the best of the herd and your Solmes's in turn invade youWretches that looking upon the rest of your family need not despair of succeeding in an alliance with itBut to you what an inexcusable pr  sumption  Yet I am afraid all opposition will be in vain You must you will I doubt be sacrificed to this odious manI know your familyThere will be no resisting such baits as he has thrown outO my dear my beloved friend and are such charming qualities is such exalted merit to be sunk in such a marriageYou must not your uncle tells my mamma dispute their authority AUTHORITY what a full word is that in the mouth of a narrowminded person who happen'd to be born thirty years before oneOf your uncles I speak for as to the  parental  authority That ought to be sacredBut should not parents have  reason  for what they do  Wonder not however at your Bell's unsisterly behaviour in this affair I have a particular to add to the inducements your insolent brother is govern'd by which will account for all her driving Her  outward eye  as  you  have own'd was from  the first  struck with the figure and address of the man whom she pretends to despise and who 'tis certain thoroughly despises her But you have not told us that  still  she loves him of all men Bell has a meanness in her very pride and no one is so proud as Bell She has own'd  her love her uneasy days and sleepless nights and her revenge grafted upon it to her favourite Betty BarnesTo lay herself in the power of a servant's tonguePoor creatureBut LIKE little souls will find one another out and mingle as well as LIKE great ones This however she told the wench in strict confidence And thus by way of the  female roundabout  as Lovelace had the sauciness on such another occasion in ridicule of our sex to call it Betty pleased to be thought worthy of a secret and to have an opportunity of inveighing against Lovelace's perfidy as she would have it to be told it to one of  her  confidants That confidant with like injunctions of secrecy to Miss Lloyd's HarriotHarriot to Miss LloydMiss Lloyd to  me  I to youwith leave to make what you please of itAnd now you will not wonder to find in Miss Bell an implacable rivaless rather than an affectionate sister and will be able to account for the words  witchcraft syren  and suchlike thrown out against you and for her driving on for a fixed day for sacrificing you to Solmes In short for her rudeness and violence of every kindWhat a sweet revenge will she take as well upon Lovelace as upon you if she can procure her rival and allexcelling sister to be married to the man that sister hates and so prevent her having the man whom she herself loves whether  she  have hope of him or not and whom she suspects her sister loves Poisons and poniards have often been set to work by minds inflam'd by disappointed love and revenge will you wonder then that the ties of relationship in such a case have no force and that a sister forgets to be a sister  This her secret motive the more resistless because her pride is concern'd to make her disavow it join'd with her former envy and with the general and avowed inducements particularized by you now it is known fills me with apprehensions for you Join'd  also by a brother who has such an ascendant over the whole family and whose  interest  slave to it as he always was and whose  revenge  his other darling passion are engaged to ruin you with everyone Both having the ears of all your family and continually misrepresenting all you say all you do to them Their subject the rencounter and Lovelace's want of morals to expatiate uponO my dear how will you be able to withstand all thisI am sure alas I am  too  sure that they will subdue such a fine spirit as yours unused to opposition and  Tell it not in Gath  you  must  be Mrs Solmes  Mean time it is now easy as you will observe to guess from what quarter the report I mention'd to you in one of my former came That the younger sister has robb'd the elder of her lover For Betty whisper'd it at the time she whisper'd the rest that neither Lovelace nor you had done honourably by  her  young mistressHow cruel my dear in you to  ob the poor Bella of the only lover she ever hadAt the instant too that she was priding herself that  ow at last she should have it in her power not only  o gratify her own susceptibilities but to give an ex  mple to the  flirts  of her sex my worship's self the  rincipal I suppose with her how to govern their man with a silken rein and without a kerbbridle  Upon the whole I have now no doubt of their  ersevering in favour of the despicable Solmes and of  heir dependence upon the gentleness of your temper  nd the regard you have for their favour and for your  wn reputation And now I am more than ever con  inced of the propriety of the advice I formerly gave  ou to keep in your own hands the estate bequeathed  o you by your grandfatherHad you done so it  ould have procured you at least an  outward  respect  om your brother and sister which would have made  em conceal the envy and illwill that now is bursting  oon you from hearts so narrow  I must harp a little more upon this stringDon't you observe how much your brother's influence has overtopp'd yours since he has got into fortunes so considerable and since you have given some of them an appetite to  continue  in themselves the possession of your estate unless you comply with their terms  I know your dutiful your laudable motives and one would have thought that you might have trusted to a father who so dearly loved you But had you been actually in possession of that estate and living up to it and upon it your youth protected from blighting tongues by the company of your prudent Norton as you had purposed do you think that your brother grudging it to you at the time as he did and looking upon it as his right as an only son would have been practising about it and aiming at itI told you some time ago that I thought your trials but proportion'd to your prudenceBut you will be more than woman if you can extricate yourself with honour having such violent spirits and sordid minds as in some and such tyrannical and despot  wills as in others to deal withIndeed all  may  be done and the world be taught further to admire you for your blind duty and willless resignation if yo  can persuade yourself to be Mrs Solmes  I am pleased with the instances you give me of Mr Lovelace's benevolence to his own tenants and with his little gift to your uncle's Mrs Fortescue  allows  him to be the best of landlords I might have told yo  That had I thought it necessary to put you in some little conceit of him He has qualities in short that may make him a tolerable creature on the other side  fifty But God help the poor woman to whose lot he shall fall till then  Women  I should say perhaps since he may break half a dozen hearts before that timeBut to the point I was uponShall we not have reason to commend the tenant's grateful honesty if we a  told that with joy the poor man call'd out your uncl  and on the spot paid him in part of his debt those two  uineasBut what shall we say of that landlord who tho' he knew the poor man to be quite destitute  ould take it and saying nothing while Mr Love  ce staid as soon as he was gone tell of it praising  he poor fellow's honestyWere this so and were  ot that landlord related to my dearest friend how  ould I despise such a wretchBut perhaps the  ory is aggravated Covetous people have every  ne's ill word And so indeed they ought because  hey are only sollicitous to keep that which they pre  er to everyone's good oneCovetous indeed would they be who deserved  neither  yet expected  both  I long for your next letter Continue to be as par  cular as possible I can think of no other subject but  hat relates to you and to your affairs For I am and ever will be most affectionately  All your own ANNA HOWE  LETTER XVI Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE  Her last not at the time received  Friday March  O MY dear friend I have had a sad conflict trial upon trial conference upon conferenceBut that law what ceremony can give a man a right to heart which abhors him more than it does any of God Almighty's creatures  I hope my mamma will be able to prevail for me  ut I will recount all tho' I sit up the whole night  do it for I have a vast deal to write and will be minute as you wish me to be  In my last I told you in a fright my apprehen  ons which were grounded upon a conversation that  passed between my mamma and my aunt part  which Hannah overheard I need not give you th  further particulars since what I have to relate to yo  from different conversations that have passed between my mamma and me in the space of a very few hour  will include them all I will begin then  I went down this morning when breakfast w  ready with a very uneasy heart from what Hanna  had told me yesterday afternoon wishing for an opportunity however to appeal to my mamma in hopes  engage her interest in my behalf and purposing  try to find one when she retired to her own apart+ment after breakfastBut unluckily there was th  odious Solmes sitting asquat between my mamma an  sister with  so much  assurance in his looksBut yo  k  ow my dear that those we love not cannot  anything to please us  Had the wretch kept his seat it might have bee  well enough But the bent and broadshoulder'd crea+ture must needs rise and stalk towards a chair whi  was just by that which was set for me  I removed it at a distance as if to make way  my own And down I sat abruptly I believe wha  I had heard all in my head  But this was not enough to daunt him The m  is a very confident he is a very bold staring manIndeed my dear the man is very confident  He took the removed chair and drew it so ne  mine squatting in it with his ugly weight that  press'd upon my hoopI was so offended all I h  heard as I said in my head that I removed to a  other chair I own I had too little command of m  +self It gave my brother and sister too much adva  +tage I dare say they took itBut I did it involu  +tarily I think I could not help itI knew n  what I did  I saw my papa was excessively displeased Wh  angry no man's countenance ever shew'd it so mu  my papa's Clarissa Harlowe said he with a big  oice and there he stopp'dSir said I and courte  'dI trembled and put my chair nearer the  retch and sat down my face I could feel all in a  ow  Make tea child said my kind mamma Sit by  e love and make tea  I removed with pleasure to the seat the man had  itted and being thus indulgently put into employ  ent soon recover'd myself and in the course of  e breakfasting officiously asked two or three que  tions of Mr Solmes which I would not have done  ut to make up with my papa  Proud spirits may  e brought to  whisperingly spoke my sister to me  ver her shoulder with an air of triumph and scorn  ut I did not mind her  My mamma was all kindness and condescension  asked her once if she were pleased with the tea  he said softly and again called me  dear  she was  leased with all I did I was very proud of this en  ouraging goodness And all blew over as I hoped  etween my papa and me for he also spoke kindly  o me two or three times  Small incidents these my dear to trouble you with only as they lead to greater as you shall hear  Before the usual breakfasttime was over my papa withdrew with my mamma telling her he wanted to  eak to her My sister and my aunt who was with  s next dropt away  My brother gave himself some airs of insult that  understood well enough but which Mr Solmes  ould make nothing ofAnd at last he arose from is seatSister said he I have a curiosity to shew  ou I will fetch it And away he went shutting  he door close after him  I saw what all this was for I arose the man hem  ing up for a speech rising and beginning to set is splayfeet indeed my dear the man in all his  ways is hateful to me in an approaching postureI will save my brother the trouble of bringing to me his curiosity said II courtesy'dYour servant SirThe man cry'd Madam Madam twice and look'd like a foolBut away I wentto find my brother to save my wordBut my brother was gone indifferent as the weather was to walk in the garden with my sister A plain case that he had left his curiosity with me and design'd to shew me no other  I had but just got into my own apartment and began to think of sending Hannah to beg an audience of my mamma the more encouraged by her condescending goodness at breakfast when Shorey her woman brought me her commands to attend her in her closet  My papa Hannah told me had just gone out of it with a positive angry countenance Then I as much dreaded the audience as I had wished for it before  I went down however but apprehending the subject approached her trembling and my heart in visible palpitations  She saw my concern Holding out her kind arms as she sat Come kiss me my dear said she with a smile like a sunbeam breaking thro' the cloud that overshadowed her naturally benign aspect Why flutters my jewel so  This preparative sweetness with her goodness just before confirmed my apprehensions My mamma saw the bitter pill wanted gilding  O my mamma was all I could say and I clasp'd my arms round her neck and my face sunk into her bosom  My child my child restrain said she your powers of movingI dare not else trust myself with youAnd my tears trickled down her bosom as hers bedew'd my neck  O the words of kindness all to be express'd in vain that flow'd from her lips  Lift up your sweet face my best child my own Clarissa HarloweO my daughter bestbeloved of my heart lift up a face so everamiable to meWhy these sobsIs an apprehended duty so affecting a thing that before I can speakBut I am glad my love you can guess at what I have to say to you I am spared the pains of breaking to you what was a task upon me reluctantly enough undertaken to break to you  Then rising she drew a chair near her own and made me sit down by her overwhelm'd as I was with tears of apprehension of what she had to say and of gratitude for her truly maternal goodness to me sobs still my only language  And drawing her chair still nearer to mine she put her arms round my neck and my glowing cheek wet with my tears close to her own Let me talk to you my child since silence is your choice hearken to me and  be  silent  You know my dear what I every day forego and undergo for the sake of peace Your papa is a very good man and means well but he will not be controuled nor yet persuaded You have seem'd to pity  me  sometimes that I am obliged to give up every point Poor man  his  reputation the less for it  mine  the greater yet would I not have this credit if I could help it at so dear a rate to  him  and to  myself  You are a dutiful a prudent and a  wise  child she was pleased to say in hope no doubt to make me so You would not add I am sure to my trouble You would not wilfully break that peace which costs your mamma so much to preserve Obedience is better than sacrifice O my Clary Harlowe rejoice my heart by telling me I have apprehended too muchI see your concern I see your perplexity I see your conflict loosing her arm and  rising not willing I should see how much she herself was affected I will leave you a momentAnswer me not for I was essaying to speak and had as soon as she took her dear cheek from mine dropt down on my knees my hands clasped and lifted up in a supplicating manner I am not prepared for your irresistible expostulation she was pleased to sayI will leave you to recollection And I charge you on my blessing that all this my truly maternal tenderness be not thrown away upon you  And then she withdrew into the next apartment wiping her eyes as she went from me as mine overflow'd my heart taking in the whole compass of her meaning  She soon returned having recover'd more steadiness  Still on my knees I had thrown my face cross the chair she had sat in  Look up to me my Clary Harlowe No sullenness I hope  No indeed my everto berevered mammaAnd I aroseI bent my knee  She raised me No kneeling to me but with knees of duty and complianceYour heart not your knees must bendIt is absolutely determin'dPrepare yourself therefore to receive your  papa  when he visits you byandby as he would wish to receive  you  But on this one quarter of an hour depends the peace of my future life the satisfaction of all the family and your own security from a man of violence And I charge you  besides  on my blessing that you think of being Mrs Solmes  There went the dagger to my heart and down I sunk and when I recover'd found myself in the arms of my Hannah my sister's Betty holding open my reluctantly open'd palm my laces cut my linen scented with hartshorn and my mamma goneHad I been  less  kindly treated the hated name still  forborn to be mention'd or mention'd with a little more preparation and reserve I had stood the horrid sound with less visible emotionBut to be bid on the blessing of a mother so dearly beloved so truly reverenc'd to think of being Mrs SOLMES what a denunciation was that  Shorey came in with a message deliver'd in her solemn way Your mamma Miss is concern'd for your disorder She expects you down again in an hour and bid me say that she then hopes every thing from your duty  I made no reply for what could I say And leaning upon my Hannah's arm withdrew to my own apartment There you will guess how the greatest part of the hour was employed  Within that time my mamma came up to  me    I love she was pleased to say to come into  this  apartmentNo emotions child No fluttersAm I not your motherAm I not your fond your indulgent mother Do not discompose  me  by discomposing  yourself  Do not occasion  me  uneasiness when I would give  you  nothing but pleasure Come my dear we will go into your library  She took my hand led the way and made me sit down by her And after she had inquired how I did she began in a strain as if she had supposed I had made use of the intervening space to overcome all my objections  She was pleased to tell me that my papa and she in order to spare my natural modesty had taken the whole affair upon themselves  Hear me out and then speak for I was going to expostulate You are no stranger to the end of Mr Solmes's visits  O Madam  Hear me out and then speak He is not indeed every thing I wish him to be But he is a man of probity and has no vices  No vices Madam  Hear me out childYou have not behaved much amiss to him We have seen with pleasure that you have not  O Madam must I not now speak  I shall have done presentlyA young creature of your virtuous and  pious  turn she was pleased to say cannot surely love a profligate You love your brother too well to wish to marry one who had like to have killed him and who threaten'd your uncles and defies us all You have had your own way six or seven times We want to secure you against a man so vile Tell me I have a right to know whether you prefer this man to all othersYet God forbid that I should know you do for such a declaration would make us all miserable Yet tell me are your affections engag'd to this man  I knew what the inference would be if I had said they were not  You hesitate You answer me not You cannot answer me  Rising  Never more will I look upon you with an eye of favour  O Madam Madam Kill me not with your displeasure I would not I  need  not hesitate one moment did I not dread the inference if I answer you as you wishYet be that inference what it will your threatened displeasure will make me speak And I declare to you that I know not my own heart if it be not absolutely free And pray let me ask my dearest mamma in what has my conduct been faulty that like a giddy creature I must be forced to marry to save me fromFrom what Let me beseech you Madam to be the guardian of my reputationLet not your Clarissa be precipitated into a state she wishes not to enter into with any man And this upon a supposition that otherwise she shall marry herself and disgrace her whole family  Well then Clary passing over the force of my plea if your heart be free  O my beloved mamma let the usual generosity of your dear heart operate in my favour Urge not upon me the inference that made me hesitate  I won't be interrupted ClaryYou have seen in my behaviour to you on this occasion a truly maternal tenderness you have observ'd that I have undertaken this task with some reluctance because the man is not every thing and because I know you carry your notions of perfection in a man too high  Dearest Madam this one time excuse meIs there  then  any danger that I should be guilty of an imprudent thing for the man's sake you hint at  Again interruptedAm I to be question'd and argued with You know this won't do somewhere else You know it won't What reason then ungenerous girl can you have for arguing with me thus but because you think from my indulgence to you you may  What  an  I say What  can  I do What must that cause be that will not bear being argued upon  Again Clary Harlowe  Dearest Madam forgive me It was always my pride and my pleasure to obey you But look upon that mansee but the disagreeableness of his person  Now Clary do I see whose person you have in your eyeNow is Mr Solmes I see but  comparatively  disagreeable disagreeable only as another man has a much more specious person  But Madam are not his manners equally soIs not his person the true representative of his mindThat other man is not shall not be any thing to me release me but from this one man whom my heart unbidden resists  Condition thus with your papa Will  he  bear do you think to be thus dialogu'd with Have I not conjur'd you as you value my peaceWhat is it that  I  do not give upThis very task because I apprehended you would not be  easily  persuaded is a  task  indeed  upon me And will  you  give up nothing Have you not refused as many as have been offer'd to you If you would not have us guess for whom comply for comply you must or be look'd upon as in a state of defiance with your whole family  And saying this she arose and went from me But at the chamberdoor stopt and turn'd back I will not say below in what a disposition I leave you Consider of every thing The matter is resolv'd upon As you value your father's blessing and mine and the satisfaction of all the family resolve to comply I will leave you for a few moments I will come up to you again See that I find you as I wish to find you and since  your heart is free  let your duty govern it  In about half an hour my mamma return'd She found me in tears She took my hand It is my part evermore to be of the acknowleging side I believe I have needlesly exposed myself to your opposition by the method I have taken with you I first began as if I expected a denial and by my indulgence brought it upon myself  Do not my dearest mamma do not say so  Were the occasion for this debate proceeded she to have risen from myself were it in my power to dispense with your compliance you too well know what you can do with me  Would anybody my dear Miss Howe wish to marry when one sees a necessity for such a sweet temper as my mamma's either to be ruin'd or depriv'd of all power  When I came to you a second time knowing that your contradiction would avail you nothing I refused to hear your reasons And in This I was wrong too because a young creature who loves to reason and  used  to love to be convinc'd by reason ought to have all her objections heard I now therefore this third time see you and am come resolv'd  to hear all you have to say And let me my dear by my patience engage your gratitude your  generosity  I will call it because it is to You I speak who used to have a mind wholly generous Let me if your heart  be really free  let me see what it will induce you to do to oblige me And so as you permit your usual discretion to govern you I will hear all you have to say but with this intimation that say what you will it will be of no avail elsewhere  What a dreadful saying is that But could I engage your pity Madam it would be somewhat  You have as much of my pity as of my love But what is  person  Clary with one of your prudence and  your heart disengag'd    Should the eye be disgusted when the heart is to be engag'dO Madam who can think of marrying when the heart must be shock'd at the first appearance and where the disgust must be confirm'd by every conversation afterwards  This Clary is owing to your prepossession Let me not have cause to regret that noble firmness of mind in so young a creature which I thought your glory and which was my boast in your character In this instance it would be obstinacy and want of dutyHave you not made objections to several  That was to their  minds  their  principles  MadamBut this man  Is an honest man Clary Harlowe He has a good mindHe is a virtuous man  He  an honest man  His  a good mind Madam  He  a virtuous man  Nobody denies him these qualities  Can  he  be an honest man who offers terms that will rob all his own relations of their just expectationsCan  his  mind be good  You Clary Harlowe for whose sake he offers so much are the last person that should make this observation  Give me leave to say Madam that a person preferring happiness to fortune as I do that want not even what I  have  and can give up the use of  that  as an instance of duty  No more no more of your meritsYou know you will be a gainer by that chearful instance of your duty not a loser You know you have but  cast your bread upon the waters  So no more of thatFor it is not understood as a merit by everybody I assure you tho' I think it a high one and so did your papa and uncles at the time  At the time  MadamHow unworthily do my brother and sister who are afraid that the favour I was so lately in  I hear nothing against your brother and sisterWhat family feuds have I in prospect at a time when I hoped most comfort from you all  God bless my brother and sister in all their  worthy  views You shall have no family feuds if I can prevent them You yourself M  dam shall tell me what I shall bear from them and I will bear it But let  my  actions not  their  misrepresentations as I am sure has been the case by the disgraceful prohibitions I have met with speak for me  Just then up came my Papa with a sternness in his looks that made me trembleHe took two or three turns about my chamberAnd then said to my mamma who was silent as soon as she saw him  My dear you are long absentDinner is near ready What you had to say lay in a very little compass Surely you have nothing to do but to declare  your  will and  my  willBut perhaps you may be talking of the preparationsLet us have you soon downYour daughter in your hand if worthy of the name  And down he went casting his eye upon me with a look so stern that I was unable to say one word to him or even for a few minutes to my mamma  Was not this very intimidating my dear  My mamma seeing my concern seem'd to pity me She called me her good child and kissed me told me my papa should not know that I had made such opposition He has kindly furnish'd us with an excuse for being so long togetherCome my dearDinner will be upon table presentlyShall we go down And took my hand  This made me start What Madam go down to let it be supposed we were talking of  preparations  O my beloved mamma command me not down upon such a supposition  You see child that to stay longer together will be owning that you are debating about an absolute duty And that will not be borne Did not your papa himself some days ago tell you he would be obey'd I will a third time leave you I must say something by way of excuse for you And that you desire not to go down to dinnerThat your modesty on the occasion  O Madam say not my modesty on  such  an occasion For that will be to give hope  And design you  not  to give hopePerverse girl  Rising and flinging from me  take more time for considerationSince it is necessary  take  more timeAnd when I see you next let me know what blame I have to cast upon myself or to bear from your papa for my indulgence to you  She made however a little stop at the chamberdoor and seem'd to expect that I would have besought her to make the gentlest construction for me for hesitating she was pleased to say I suppose you would not have me make a report  O Madam interrupted I whose favour can I hope for if I lose my mamma's  To have desired a  favourable  report you know my dear would have been qualifying upon a point that I was too much determin'd upon to give room for  any of my friends to think I have the least hesitation about And so my mamma went down stairs  I will deposite thus far and as I know you will not think me too minute in my relation of particulars so very interesting to one you honour with your love proceed in the same way As matters stand I don't care to have papers so freely written about me  Pray let Robert call every day if you can spare him whether I have any thing ready or not  I should be glad you would not send him emptyhanded What a generosity in you to write as frequently from friendship as I am forced to do from misfortune The letters being taken away will be an assurance that you have them As I shall write and deposite as I have opportunity the formality of  super  and  sub  scription will be excused For I need not say how much I am  Your sincere and everaffectionate CL HARLOWE  LETTER XVII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    MY mamma on her return which was as soon as she had din'd was pleased to inform me that she told my papa on his questioning her about my  chearful  compliance for it seems the  chearful  was all that was doubted that she was willing on so material a point to give a child whom she had so  much reason to love  as she condescended to acknowlege were her words liberty to say all that was in her heart to say that her compliance might be the freer Letting him know that when he came up she was attending to my pleas for that she found I had rather not marry at all  She told me that to this my papa angrily said Let her take careLet her take carethat she give me not ground to suspect her of a preference somewhere  else But if it be to ease her heart and not to dispute my will you may hear her out  So Clary said my mamma I am returned in a temper accordingly if you do not again by  your  peremptoriness shew  me  how I ought to treat  you    Indeed Madam you did me justice to say I have no inclination to marry at all I have not I hope made myself so  very  unuseful in my papa's f  mily as  No more of your merits Clary You have been a good child You have eased me of all the family cares But do not now add more than ever you relieved me from You have been richly repaid in the reputation your skill and management have given youBut now there is soon to be a period to all those assistances from you If you marry there will be a natural and if to please us a desirable period because your own family will employ all your talents in that way If you do not there will be a period likewise but  not  a natural oneYou understand me child  I wept  I have made inquiry already after a housekeeper I would have had your good Norton but I suppose you will yourself wish to have the worthy woman with you If you desire it that shall be agreed upon for you  But why dearest Madam why am I the  youngest  to be precipitated into a state that I am ver  far from wishing to enter into with anybody  You are going to question me I suppose why your sister is not thought of for Mr Solmes  I hope Madam it will not displease you if I were  I might refer you for an answer to your  papa  Mr Solmes has reasons for preferring  you    And so have I Madam for disliking  him  And why am I  This quickness upon me interrupted my mamma is not to be borne I am gone and your father comes if  I  can do no good with you  Madam I would rather die than  She put her hand to my mouthNo peremptoriness Clary Harlowe Once you declare yourself inflexible I have done  I wept for vexation This is all all my brother's doingsHis grasping views  No reflections upon your brother He has intirely the honour of the family at heart  I would no more dishonour my family Madam than my brother would  I believe it But I hope you'll allow your papa and me and your uncles to judge what will do it honour what dishonour  I then offer'd to live single never to marry at all or never but with their full approbation  If I meant to shew my duty and my obedience I must shew it in  their  way not  my own    I said I hoped I had so behaved myself hitherto that there was no need of such a trial of my obedience as this  Yes she was pleased to say I had behaved extremely well But I had no trials till now And she hoped that now I was called to one I should not fail in it Parents said she when children are young are pleased with every thing they doYou have been a good child upon the whole But we have hitherto rather comply'd with you than you with us Now that you are grown up to marriageable years is the test especially as your grandfather has made you independent as we may say in preference to those who had prior expectations upon that estate  Madam my grandfather knew and expresly mentions in his will his desire that my papa will more than make it up to my sisterI did nothing but what I thought my duty to procure his favour It was rather a mark of his affection than any advantage to me For do I either seek or wish to be independent  Were I to be queen of the universe that dignity should not absolve me from my duty to you and my papa I would kneel for your blessings were it in the presence of millionsSo that  I am loth to interrupt  you  Clary tho' you could more than once break in upon meYou are young and unbrokenBut with all this ostentation of your duty I desire you to shew a little more deference to me when I am speaking  I beg your pardon dear Madam and your patience with me on such an occasion as thisIf I did not speak with earnestness upon it I should be supposed to have only maidenly objections against a man I never can abide  Clary Harlowe  Dearest dearest Madam permit me to speak what I have to say this onceIt is hard it is very hard to be forbid to enter into the cause of all because I must not speak disrepectfully of one who supposes me in the way of his ambition and treats me like a slave  Whither whither Clary  My dearest mammaMy duty will not permit me so far to suppose my father arbitrary as to make a plea of that arbitrariness to you  How now ClaryO girl  Your patience my dearest mammaYou were pleased to  say  you would hear me with patiencePERSON in a man is nothing because I am supposed to be prudent So my eye is to be disgusted and my reason not convinced  Girl girl  Thus are my imputed good qualities to be made my punishment and I am to be wedded to a  monster    AstonishingCan this Clarissa be from you  The man Madam person and mind is a monster in my eyeAnd that I may be induced to bear this  treatment I am to be complimented with being indifferent to all men Yet at other times and to serve other purposes am I to be thought prepossessed in favour of a man against whose moral character lie just objectionsConfined as if like the giddiest of creatures I would run away with this man and disgrace my whole familyO my dearest mamma who can be patient under such treatment  Now Clary I suppose you will allow  me  to speak I think I have had patience indeed with youCould I have thoughtBut I will put all upon a short issue Your  mamma  Clarissa shall shew you an example of that patience you so boldly claim from  her  without having  any yourself    O my dear how my mamma's condescension distressed me at the time infinitely more distressed me than rigour could have done But she  knew  she was to be sure  aware  that she was put upon a harsh service an unreasonable service let me say or she would not she could not have had so much patience with me  Let me tell you then proceeded she that all lies in a small compass as your papa saidYou have been hitherto as you are pretty ready to plead a dutiful childYou have indeed had no  cause  to be otherwise no child was ever more favour'dWhether you will discredit all your past actions whether at a time and upon an occasion that the highest instance of duty is expected from you an instance that is to crown all and when you declare that  your heart is free  you will give that instance or whether having a view to the independence you may claim for so Clary whatever be your motive it will be judged and which any man you favour can assert  for you against  us all or rather  for himself  in  spite  of usWhether I say you will break with us all and stand in defiance of a jealous papa needlessly jealous I will venture to say of the prerogatives  of his sex as to me and still ten times more jealous of the authority of a fatherThis is now the point with us You know your papa has made it a point and did he ever give up one he thought he had a right to carry  Too true thought I to myself And now my brother has engag'd my father his fine scheme will  walk alone  without needing his leadingstrings and it is become my father's will that I oppose not my brother's grasping views  I was silent To say the truth I was just then  sullenly  silent My heart was too big I thought it was hard to be thus given up by my mamma and that she should make a will so uncontroulable as my brother's her will  But this silence availed me still less  I see my dear said she that you are convinc'd Now my good child now my Clary do I love you It shall not be known that you have argued with me at all All shall be imputed to that modesty which has ever so much distinguish'd you You shall have the full merit of your resignation  I wept  She tenderly wip'd the tears from my eyes and kiss'd my cheekYour papa expects you down with a chearful countenanceBut I will excuse your going All your scruples you see have met with an indulgence truly maternal from me I rejoice in the hope that you are convinc'd This indeed seems to be a proof of the welcome truth you have asserted That  your heart is free    Did not this seem to border upon  cruelty  my dear in so indulgent a mammaIt would be wicked would it not to suppose my mamma capable of  art  But she is put upon it and obliged to take methods her heart is naturally above stooping to and all intended for my good because she sees that no arguing will be admitted anywhere else  I will go down proceeded she and excuse your attendance at afternoontea as I did to dinner For I know you will have some little reluctances to conquer I will allow you those and also some little natural shynessesAnd so you  shan't  come down if you choose  not  to come downOnly my dear don't disgrace my report when you come to supper And besure behave as you used to do to your brother and sister for your behaviour to them will be one test of your chearful obedience to us I advise as a friend you see rather than command as a motherSo adieu my love And again she kissed me and was going  O my dear mamma said I forgive meBut surely you cannot believe I can ever think of having that man  She was very angry and seemed to be greatly disappointed She threatened to turn me over to my papa and my unclesShe bid me generously bid me consider if I thought my brother and sister had views to serve by making my uncles dissatisfied with me what a handle I gave them She told me That she had early said all that she thought could be said against the present proposal on a supposition that I who had refused several others whom she own'd to be preferable as to person should  not  approve of it and could she have prevailed I had never heard of it And if SHE could not how could  I  expect itThat it was equally my good in order to preserve to me the share I had hitherto held in everybody's affections and her own peace that she wished to promote by the task she had undertakenThat my papa would flame out upon my refusal to complyThat my uncles were so much convinced of the consistence of the measure with their favourite views of aggrandizing the family that they were as much determin'd as my papaThat my aunt Hervey and my uncle Hervey were of the same partyThat it was hard if a  father and mother and uncles and aunt all conjoin'd could not be allowed to direct my choiceThat surely I was not the  more  averse because the  family view  would be promoted by the matchThat this would be the light she could assure me in which my refusal would be taken by everybodyThat all the asseverations I could make of living single while the man who was so obnoxious to everybody remain'd unmarry'd and while he  buzz'd  about me was the word would have no weight with any of themThat if Mr Lovelace were an angel and my father made it a point that I should not have him I must be sensible he would not have his will disputed Especially as it was not doubted that I corresponded with him To the belief of which and that it was by Miss Howe's means were owing the prohibition laid upon me so much against her liking she was pleased to say  I answer'd to every article she had spoken to as above in such a manner as I am sure would have satisfy'd her could she have been permitted to judge for herself and then inveighed with bitterness against the disgraceful prohibitions laid upon me  They would serve to shew me she was pleased to say how much in earnest my papa was They might be taken off whenever I thought fit and no harm done nor disgrace received But if I were to be contumacious I might thank myself for all that would follow  I sigh'd I wept I was silent  Shall I Clary said she tell your papa that these prohibitions are as unnecessary as I hoped they would be That you know your  duty  and will not offer to controvert his willWhat say you my love  O Madam what can I say to questions so indulgently put I do indeed  know  my duty No creature in the world is more willing to  practise  it But pardon me dearest Madam if I say That I must bear  these prohibitions if I am to pay so dear to have them taken off  Determin'd and perverse my dear mamma called me And after walking twice or thrice in anger about the room she turn'd to meYour heart  free  Clarissa How can you tell me your heart is free Such extraordinary antipathies to a particular person must be owing to extraordinary prepossessions in another's favourTell me Clary and tell me trulyDo you not continue to correspond with Mr Lovelace  Dearest Madam reply'd I you know my motives To prevent mischief I answer'd his Letters The reason for our apprehensions of this sort are not over  I own to you Clary altho' now I would not have it known that I once thought a little qualifying among such violent spirits was not amiss I did not know but all things would come round again by Lord M's and his two sisters mediation But as they all three think proper to resent for their nephew and as their nephew thinks fit to defy us all and as terms are offer'd on another hand that could not be asked which will very probably prevent your grandfather's estate going out of the family and may be a means to bring a still greater into it I see not that the continuance of your correspondence with him either can or ought to be permitted I therefore now forbid it to you as you value my favour  Be pleased Madam only to advise me how to break it off with safety to my brother and uncles and it is all I wish for Would to heaven the man so hated had not the pretence to make of having been too violently treated when he meant peace and reconciliation It would always have been i  my own power to have broke with himHis reputed immoralities would have given me a just pretence at any time to do soBut Madam as my uncles and my brother will keep no measuresas he has heard  what the view is and as I have reason to think that he is only restrained by his regard for me from resenting their violent treatment of him and his family what can I doWould you have me Madam make him desperate  The Law will protect us childOffended magistracy will assert itself  But Madam may not some dreadful mischief first happenThe Law asserts not itself till it is offended  You have made offers Clary if you might be obliged in the point in questionAre you really in earnest on that condition to break off all correspondence with Mr LovelaceLet me know this  Indeed I am and I will You Madam shall see every letter that has passed between us You shall see I have given him no encouragement independent of my dutyAnd when you have seen them you will be better able to direct me how on that condition to break intirely with him  I take you at your word Clarissa Give me  his  letters and the copies of  yours    I am sure Madam you will keep the knowlege that I write and what I write  No conditions with your mammaSurely my prudence may be trusted to  I begg'd her pardon and besought her to take the key of the private drawer in my escrutoire where they lay that she herself might see that I had no reserves to my mamma  She did and took all his letters and the copies of mine  Un  condition'd with she was pleased to say they shall be yours again unseen by anybody else  I thank'd her and she withdrew to read them saying she would return them when she had  YOU my dear have seen all the letters that have passed between him and me till my last return from  you You have acknowleg'd that he has nothing to boast of from them Three others I have received since by the private conveyance I told you of the last I have not yet answer'd  In these three as in those you have seen after having besought my favour and in the most earnest manner professed the sincerity of his passion for me and set forth the indignities done him the defiances my brother throws out against him in all companies the menaces and hostile appearance of my uncles whereever they go or come and the methods they take to defame him he declares  'That neither his own honour nor his family's involved as that is in the undistinguishing reflections cast upon him for an unhappy affair which he would have shunn'd but could not permit him to bear these confirmed indignities That as my inclinations if not favourable to  him  cannot be nor are to such a man as the newsetup Solmes he is interested the more to resent my brother's behaviour who to everybody avows his rancour and malice and glories in the probability he has thro' this Solmes's address of mortifying  me  and avenging himself on  him  That it is impossible he should not think himself concern'd to frustrate a measure so directly level'd at him had he not still a higher motive for hoping to frustrate it That I must forgive him if he enters into conference with Solmes upon it He earnestly insists upon what he has so often proposed That I will give him leave in company with Lord M to wait upon my uncles and even upon my papa or mamma promising patience if new provocations absolutely beneath a man to bear are not given'  Which by the way I am far from being able to engage for  In my answer I absolutely declare as I tell him I have often done  'That he is to expect no favour from me against the approbation of my friends  That I am sure their consents for his visiting any of them will never be obtained That I will not be either so undutiful or so indiscreet as to suffer my interests to be separated from the interests of my family for any man on earth That I do not think myself  obliged  to him for the forbearance I desire one flameing spirit to have with others That in this desire I require nothing of him but what prudence justice and the laws of his country oblige from him That if he has any expectations of favour from me on that account he deceives himself That I have no inclination as I have often told him to change my condition That I cannot allow myself to correspond with him any longer in this clandestine manner It is mean low undutiful I tell him and has a giddy appearance which cannot be excused That therefore he is not to expect that I  will  continue it'  To this in his last among other things he replies  'That if I am actually determin'd to break off all correspondence with him he must conclude that it is with a view to become the wife of a man whom no woman of honour and fortune can think tolerable And in that case I must excuse him for saying that he shall neither be able to bear the thoughts of losing for ever a person in whom all his present and all his future hopes are centred nor support himself with patience under the insolent triumphs of my brother upon it But that he will not presume to threaten either his own life or that of any other man He must take his resolutions as such a dreaded event shall impell him at the time If he shall know that it will be with my own consent he must endeavour to resign to his destiny But if it be brought about by compulsion he shall not be able to answer for the consequence'  I will send you these letters for your perusal in a few days I would inclose them but that it is possible something may happen which may make my  mamma require to see them againYou will see my dear by his how he endeavours to hold me to this correspondence  IN about an hour my mamma return'd Take your letters Clary I have nothing to task your discretion with as to the wording of yours to him You have even kept up a proper dignity as well as decorum And you have resented as you ought to resent his menacing invectives But  can  you think from the avowed hatred of one side and the avowed defiance of the other that this can be a suitable match  Can  you think it becomes you to encourage an address from a man who has fought a duel with your brother let his fortune and professions be what they will  By no means it can Madam you will be pleased to observe that I have said as much to him But now Madam the whole correspondence is before you and I beg your commands what to do in a situation so very disagreeable  One thing I will tell you Clary Harlowe But I charge you as you would not have me question the generosity of your spirit to take no advantage of it either  mentally  or  verbally  were the words That I am so much pleased with the offer of your keys to me in so chearful and unreserved a manner and in the prudence you have shewn in your letters that were it practicable to bring every one or your father only into my opinion I should readily leave all the rest to your discretion reserving only to myself the direction or approbation of your future letters and to see that you broke off the correspondence as soon as possible But as it is not and as I know your papa would have no patience with you should it be acknowleg'd that you correspond with Mr Lovelace or that you  have  corresponded with him since the time he prohibited  you so to do I forbid you continuing such a liberty Yet as the case is difficult let me ask you What you yourself can propose Your heart you  say is free  You own that you cannot think as matters are circumstanced that a match with a man so obnoxious as he now is to us all is proper to be thought of What do you propose to doWhat Clary are your own thoughts of the matter  Without hesitation for I saw I was upon a new trial thus I answer'dWhat I humbly propose is this  'That I will write to Mr Lovelace for I have not answer'd his last that he has nothing to do between my father and me That I neither  ask  his advice nor  need  it But that since he thinks he has some pretence for interfering because of my brother's avowal of the interest of Mr Solmes in malice to him I will assure him without giving him any reason to impute the assurance to be in the least favourable to himself that I never will be that man's'  And if proceeded I I may be permitted to give him this assurance and Mr Solmes in consequence of it be discouraged from prosecuting his address let Mr Lovelace be satisfy'd or dissatisfy'd I will go no farther nor write another line to him nor ever see him more if I can avoid it And shall have a good excuse for it without bringing in any of my family  Ah my loveBut what shall we do about the  terms  Mr Solmes offers Those are the inducements with everybody He has even given hopes to your brother that he will make exchanges of estates or at least that he will purchase the northern one for you know it must be intirely consistent with the family views that we increase our interest in this county Your brother in short has given in a plan that captivates us all And a family so rich in all its branches that has it's views to honour must be pleased to see a very great probability of being on a footing with the principal in the kingdom  And for the sake of these views for the sake of this plan of my brother's am I Madam to be given in marriage to a man I never can endureO my dear mamma save me save me if you can from this heavy evilI had rather be bury'd alive indeed I had than have that man  She chid me for my vehemence but was so good as to tell me That she would venture to talk with my uncle Harlowe and if he encourag'd her or would engage to second her with my papa and I should hear further in the morning  She went down to tea and kindly undertook to excuse my attendance at supper And I immediately had recourse to my pen to give you these particulars  But is it not a sad thing I repeat to be obliged to stand in opposition to the will of such a mamma Why as I often say to myself was such a man as this Solmes fix'd upon The only man in the world surely that could offer so much and deserve so little  Little indeed does he deserveWhy my dear the man has the most indifferent of characters Every mouth is open'd against him for his sordid waysA  foolish  man to be so basemindedWhen the difference between the obtaining of a fame for generosity and incurring the censure of being a miser will not prudently manag'd cost fifty pounds a year  What a name have you got at a less expence And what an opportunity had he of obtaining credit at a very small one succeeding such a wretched creature as Sir Oliver in fortunes so vastYet has he so behaved that the common phrase is apply'd to him  That Sir  Oliver  will never be dead while Mr  Solmes  lives    The world as I have often thought illnatured as it is said to be is generally more just in characters speaking by what it  feels  than is usually apprehended And those who complain most of its censoriousness  perhaps should look  inwardly  for the occasion oftener than they do  My heart is a little at ease on the hopes that my mamma will be able to procure favour for me and a deliverance from this man and so I have leisure to moralize But if I had  not  I should not forbear to intermingle occasionally these sort of remarks because you command me never to omit them when they occur to my mind And not to be able to make them even in a more affecting situation when one sits down to write would shew one'sself more engaged to  self  and one's  own  concerns than attentive to the wishes of a friend If it be said that it is  natural  so to be what makes that  nature  on occasions where a friend may be obliged or reminded of a piece of instruction which writing down one'sself may be the better for but a  fault  which it would set a person above nature to subdue  LETTER XVIII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Sat Mar  WOULD you not have thought that something might have been obtained in my favour from an offer so reasonable from an expedient so proper as I imagine to put a tolerable end as  from myself  to a correspondence I hardly know how otherwise with safety to some of my family to get rid ofBut my brother's plan which my mamma spoke of and of which I have in vain endeavour'd to procure a copy with a design of taking it to pieces and exposing it as I question not there is room to do together with my papa's impatience of contradiction is irresistible  I have not been in bed all night nor am I in the least drousy Expectation and hope and doubt an uneasy state kept me sufficiently wakeful I stept  down at my usual time that it might not be known I had not been in bed and gave directions in the family way  About eight o' clock Shorey came to me from my mamma with orders to attend her in her chamber  My mamma had been weeping I saw by her eyes But her aspect seem'd to be less tender and less affectionate than the day before and this struck me with an awe as soon as I entered her presence which gave a great damp to my spirits  Sit down Clary Harlowe I shall talk to you byandby And was looking into a drawer among laces and linen in a way neither busy nor unbusy  After some time she ask'd me coldly What directions I had given for the day  I gave her the bill of fare for this day and tomorrow if I said it pleased her to approve of it  She made a small alteration in it but with an air so cold and so solemn as added to the emotions I enter'd into her presence with  Mr Harlowe talks of dining out today I think at my brother Antony's  Mr HarloweNot my papaHave I not then a papathought I  Sit down when I bid you  I sat down  You look very sullen Clary  I hope not Madam  If children would always be childrenparentsAnd there she stopt  She then went to her toilette and looked in the glass and gave half a sighthe other half as if she would not have sighed could she have help'd it she gently hem'd away  I don't love to see the girl look so sullen  Indeed Madam I am not sullenAnd I arose and turning from her drew out my handkerchief for the tears ran down my cheeks I thought by  the glass before me I saw the  mother  in her soften'd eye cast towards meBut her words confirm'd not the hop'dfor tenderness  One of the provoking'st things in the world is to have people cry for what they can help  I wish to heaven I could Madamand I sobb'd again  Tears of penitence and sobs of perverseness are mighty well suitedYou may go up to your chamber I shall talk with you byandby  I courtesy'd with reverence  Mock me not with outward gesture of respect The heart Clary is what I want  Indeed Madam you have it It is not so much mine as my mamma's  Fine talkingAs somebody says If words were duty Clarissa Harlowe would be the dutifullest child breathing  God bless that somebodyBe it whom it will God bless that somebodyAnd I courtesy'd and pursuant to her last command was going  She seem'd struck but  was  to be angry with me  So turning from me she spoke with quickness Whither now Clary Harlowe  You commanded me Madam to go to my chamber  I see you are very ready to go out of my presence Is your compliance the effect of sullenness or obedienceYou are very ready to leave me  I could hold no longer but threw myself at her feet O my dearest mamma Let me know all I am to suffer Let me know what I am to be I will bear it if I  can  bear it But your displeasure I cannot bear  Leave me leave me Clary HarloweNo kneelingLimbs so supple Will so stubbornRise I tell you  I cannot rise I will disobey my mamma when  she bids me leave her without her being reconciled to me No sullens my mamma No perverseness But worse than either This is direct disobedienceYet tear not yourself from me wrapping my arms about her as I kneeled she struggling to get from me my face lifted up to hers with eyes running over that spoke not my heart if they were not all humility and reverence You must not must not tear yourself from me for still the dear lady struggled and looked this way and that in a sweet disorder as if she knew not what to doI will neither rise nor leave you nor let you go till you say you are not angry with me  O thou evermoving child of my heart folding her dear arms about my neck as mine embraced her knees Why was this taskBut leave meYou have discomposed me beyond expressionLeave me my dearI won't be angry with youif I can help itif you'll be good  I arose trembling and hardly knowing what I did or how I stood or walk'd withdrew to my chamber My Hannah followed me as soon as she heard me quit my mamma's presence and with salts and springwater just kept me from fainting and that was as much as she could do It was near two hours before I could so far recover myself as to take up my pen to write to you how unhappily my hopes have ended  My mamma went down to breakfast I was not fit to appear But if I had been better I suppose I should not have been sent for my papa's hint when in my chamber being To bring me down if worthy of the name of daughter That I doubt I never shall be in  his  opinion if he be not brought to change his mind as to this Mr Solmes  LETTER XIX Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE  In answer to Letter  XV    Sat March o' clock  HANNAH has just now brought me from the usual place your favour of yesterday The contents of it have made me very thoughtful and you will have an answer in my gravest style  I  to have that Mr SolmesNo indeedI will soonerBut I will write first to other parts of your letter that are less concerning that I may touch upon this part with more patience  As to what you mention of my sister's value for Mr Lovelace I am not very much surprised at it She takes such  officious  pains and it is so much her subject to have it thought that she never  did  and never  could  like him that she gives but too much room to suspect her Then she never tells the story of their parting and of her refusal of him but her colour rises she looks with disdain upon me and mingles anger with the airs she gives herselfBoth anger and airs at least demonstrating that she refused a man whom she thought worth accepting Where else is the reason either for anger or boastPoor Bella She is to be pity'dShe cannot either like or dislike with temperWould to heaven she had been mistress of all her wishesWould to heaven she had  As to the article of giving up to my papa's controul the estate bequeathed me my motives at the time as you acknowlege were not blameable Your advice to me on the subject was grounded as I remember on your good opinion of me believing that I should not make a bad use of the power willed me Neither you nor I my dear altho' you now assume the air of a diviner pardon me could have believed That would have happen'd which has happen'd as to my  father  's  part particularly You were indeed jealous of my brother's views against me or rather of his predominant love of Self but I did not think so hardly of my brother and sister as you always did You never loved them and illwill has eyes always open to the faulty side as goodwill or love is blind even to real imperfections I will briefly recollect my motives  I found jealousies and uneasiness rising in every breast where all before was unity and love The honoured testator was reflected upon A second childhood was attributed to him and I was censured as having taken advantage of it All young creatures thought I more or less covet independency but those who wish most for it are seldom the fittest to be trusted either with the government of themselves or with power over others This is certainly a very high and unusual bequest to so young a creature We should not aim at  all  we have power to do To take all that goodnature or indulgence or good opinion confers shews a want of moderation and a graspingness that is unworthy of that indulgence and are bad indications of the  use  that may be made of the power bequeathed It is true thought I that I have formed agreeable schemes of making others as happy as myself by the proper discharge of the stewardship intrusted to me Are not all estates stewardships my dear But let me examine myself Is not vanity or secret love of praise a principal motive with me at the bottomOught I not to suspect my own heart If I set up for myself puffed up with every one's good opinion may I not be  left  to myselfEvery one's eyes are upon the conduct upon the visits upon the visit  ors  of a young creature of our sex made independent And are not such moreover the subjects of the attempts of the  worst  of the otherAnd then left to myself should I take a wrong step tho' with ever so good an intention how many should I have to triumph over me how few to pityThe more  of the one and the fewer of the other for having aimed at excelling  These were some of my reflections at the time And I have no doubt but that in the same situation I should do the very same thing and that upon the maturest deliberation Who can command or foresee events To act up to our best judgments at the time is all we can do If I have err'd 'tis to worldly wisdom only that I have err'd If we suffer by an act of duty or even by an act of generosity is it not pleasurable on reflection that the fault is in others rather than in ourselvesI had rather a vast deal have reason to think others unkind than that they should have any to think me undutiful And so my dear I am sure had you  And now for the  most  concerning part of your letter  You think I must of necessity be Mr Solmes's wife as matters are circumstanced I will not be very rash my dear in protesting to the contrary But I think it never never can nor  ought  to beMy temper I know is depended upon But I have heretofore said that I have something in me of my father's family as well as of my mother's  See Letter  ix  p    And have I any encouragement to follow too implicitly the example which my mamma sets of meekness and resignedness to the wills of othersIs she not for ever obliged to be as she was pleased to hint to me of the  forbearing  side In my mamma's case your observation is verify'd that those who will bear much shall have much to bearWhat is it as she says that  she  has not sacrificed to peaceYet has  she  by her sacrifices always found the peace she has deserved to find Indeed NoI am afraid the very contrary And often and often have I had reason on her account to reflect that we poor mortals by our  over  sollicitude to preserve undisturbed the qualities we are constitutionally fond of frequently lose the benefits we propose to ourselves from them  Since the designing and incroaching finding out what we most fear to forfeit direct their batteries against these our weaker places and making an artillery if I may so phrase it of our hopes and fears play it upon us at their pleasure  Steadiness of mind a quality which the illbred and censorious deny to any of our sex when one is convinced of being in the right otherwise it is not steadiness but obstinacy and in  material  cases is a quality my good Dr Lewin was wont to say that brings great credit to the possessor of it at the same time that it usually when  try'd  and  known  raises  such  above the attempts of the meanly machinating He used therefore to inculcate upon me this steadiness upon laudable convictions And why may I not think that I am now put upon an exercise of itI have said that I never can be that I never ought to be Mrs SolmesI repeat that I  ought  not For surely my dear I should not give up to my brother's ambition the happiness of my future lifeSurely I ought not to be the instrument to deprive Mr Solmes's relations of their natural rights and reversionary prospects for the sake of further aggrandizing a family altho'  that  I am of which already lives in great affluence and splendor and who might be as justly dissatisfy'd were what some some of them aim at to be obtained that they were not princes as now they are that they are not peers for when ever was an ambitious mind as you observe in the case of avarice  See Letter  x  p    satisfy'd by acquisition The less surely ought I to give into these grasping views of my brother as I myself heartily despise the end aimed at as I wish not either to change my state or better my fortunes and as I am fully persuaded that happiness and riches are  two  things and very seldom meet together  Yet I dread I exceedingly dread the conflicts I know I must encounter with It is possible that I  may be more unhappy from the due observation of the good doctor's general precept than were I to yield the point since what I call  steadiness  is attributed to stubbornness to obstinacy to prepossession by those who have a right to put what interpretation they please upon my conduct  So my dear were we perfect which no one can be we could not be happy in this life unless those with whom we have to deal those more especially who have any controul upon us were govern'd by the same principles What have we then to do but as I have hinted above to choose right and pursue it steadily and leave the issue to Providence  This if you approve of my motives and if you don't pray inform me must be my aim in the present case  But what then can I plead for a palliation to  myself  of my mamma's sufferings on  my  account Perhaps This consideration will carry some force with itThat  her  difficulties cannot last long only till this great struggle shall be one way or other determin'dWhereas  my  unhappiness if I comply will from an aversion not to be overcome be for life To which let me add That as I have reason to think that the present measures are not enter'd upon with her own natural liking she will have the less pain should they want the success which I think in my heart they ought to want  I have run a great length in a very little time The subject touch'd me to the quick My reflections upon it will give you reason to expect from me a perhaps  too  steady behaviour in a new conference which I find I must have with my mamma My father and brother as she was pleased to tell me dine at my uncle Antony's on purpose as I have reason to believe to give an opportunity for it  Hannah informs me that she heard my papa high and angry with my mamma at taking leave of  her I suppose for being too favourable to me for Hannah heard her say as in tears  'Indeed Mr Harlowe you greatly distress meThe poor girl does not deserve'  Hannah heard no more but that he said he would break somebody's heartMine I supposeNot my mother's I hope  As only my sister dines with my mamma I thought I should have been commanded down But she sent me up a plate from her table I wrote on I could not touch a morsel I order'd Hannah however to eat of it that I might not be thought sullen  I will see before I conclude this whether any thing offers from  either  of my private correspondencies that will make it proper to add to it and will take a turn in the woodyard and garden for that purpose  I am stopp'd Hannah shall deposite this She was order'd by my mamma who ask'd where I was to tell me that she would come up and talk with me in my own closetShe is coming Adieu my dear  LETTER XX Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Sat P M  THE expected conference is over But my difficulties are increased This as my mamma was pleased to tell me being the last  persuasory  effort that will be attempted I will be as particular in the account of it as my head and my heart will allow me to be  I have made said she as she enter'd my room a short as well as early dinner on purpose to confer with you And I do assure you that it will be the last conference I shall either be permitted or  inclined  to hold with you on the subject if you should prove as refractory as some whom I hope you'll disappoint imagine you  will and thereby demonstrate that I have not the weight with you that my indulgence to you deserves  Your papa both dines and sups at your uncle's on purpose to give us this opportunity and as I shall make my report which I have promised to do very faithfully on his return he will take his measures with you  I was offering to speakHear Clarissa what I have to tell you said she before you speak unless what you have to say will signify to me your complianceSay  will  itIf it  will  you may speak  I was silent  She looked with concern and anger upon meNo compliance I findSuch a dutiful young creature hithertoWill you not can you not speak as I would have you speakThen rejecting me as it were with her hand then continue silent  I  no more than your  father  will bear your  avowed  contradiction  She paused with a look of expectation as if she waited for my consenting answer  I was still silent looking down the tears in my eyes  O thou determin'd girlBut say speak out are you resolved to stand in opposition to us all in a point our hearts are set upon  May I Madam be permitted to expostulate  To what purpose expostulate with  me  Clarissa Your  father  is determin'd Have I not told you that there is no receding that the honour as well as the benefit of the family is concerned Be ingenuous You used to be so even against yourselfWho at the long run  must  submit  all  of us to  you  or  you  to  all  of usIf you intend to yield at  last  if you find you cannot conquer yield  now  and with a gracefor yield you must or be none of our child  I wept I knew not what to say or rather how to express what I had to say  Take notice that there are flaws in your grandfather's will Not a shilling of that estate will be yours if you do not yield Your grandfather left it to you as a reward of your duty to  him  and to  us  You will  justly  forfeit it if  Permit me good Madam to say that if it were  unjustly  bequeathed me I ought not to wish to have it But I hope Mr Solmes will be apprized of these flaws  This was very pertly said she was pleased to tell me But bid me reflect that the forfeiture of that estate thro' my opposition would be attended with the total loss of my papa's favour and then how destitute I must be how unable to support myself and how many benevolent designs and good actions must I give up  I must accommodate myself I said in the latter case to my circumstances  Much  only was  required  where  much  was  given  It became me to be thankful for what I had had And I had reason to bless her and my good Mrs Norton for bringing me up to be satisfied with littlewith much less I would venture to say than my papa's indulgence annually conferr'd upon meAnd then I thought of the old Roman and his lentiles  What perverseness said my mammaBut if you depend upon the favour of either or both your uncles vain will be that dependence  They  will give you up I do assure you if your  papa  does and absolutely renounce you  I told her I was sorry that I had had so little merit as to have made no deeper impressions of favour for me in their hearts But that I would love and honour them as long as I lived  All this she was pleased to say made my prepossession in a certain man's favour the more evident Indeed my brother and sister could not go anywhither but they heard of these prepossessions  It was a great grief to me I said to be made the subject of the public talk But I hop'd she would have the goodness to excuse me for observing that the authors of my disgrace withindoors the talkers of my prepossession without and the reporters of it from abroad were originally the same persons  She severely chid me for this  I received her rebukes in silence  You are sullen Clarissa I see you are sullenAnd she walked about the room in anger Then turning to meYou can  bear  the imputation I seeYou have no concern to clear yourself of it I was afraid of telling you all I was injoined to tell you in case you were to be unpersuadeableBut I find that I had a greater opinion of your delicacy and gentleness than I needed to haveIt cannot discompose so steady so inflexible a young creature to be told that the settlements are actually drawn and that you will be called down in a very few days to hear them read and to sign them for it is impossible if your heart be free that you can make the least objection to them except that they are so much in your favour and in all our favour be one  I was speechless absolutely speechless Altho' my heart was ready to burst yet could I neither weep nor speak  She was sorry she said for my averseness to this match  match  she was pleased to call it But there was no help The honour and interest of the family as my aunt had told me and as  she  had told me were concern'd and I must comply  I was still speechless  She folded the  warm statue  as she was pleased to call me in her arms and intreated me for God's sake and for her sake to comply  Speech and tears were lent me at the same timeYou have given me life Madam said I clasping my uplifted hands together and falling on one knee a  happy one till now has  your  goodness and my  papa  's made it O do not do not make all the remainder of it miserable  Your papa reply'd she is resolv'd he will not see you till he sees you as obedient a child as you used to be You have never been put to a test till now that deserv'd to be called a test This  is  This  must  be my last effort with you Give me hope my dear child My peace is concerned I will compound with you but for  hope  and yet your father will not be satisfy'd without an implicit and even a chearful obedienceGive me but hope my child  To give you hope my dearest my most indulgent mamma is to give you every thing Can I be honest if I give a hope that I cannot confirm  She was very angry She again called me perverse She upbraided me with regarding only my own inclinations and respecting not either her peace of mind or my own duty  'It was a grating thing she said for the parents of a child who delighted in her in all the time of her helpless infancy and throughout every stage of her childhood and in every part of her education to womanhood because of the promises she gave of proving the most grateful and dutiful of children to find that just when the time arrived which should crown all their wishes she should stand in the way of her own happiness and her parents comfort and refusing an excellent offer and noble settlements give suspicions to her anxious friends that she would become the property of a vile rake and libertine who be the occasion what it  would  defy'd her family and had actually embrued his hands in her brother's blood'  She added  'That she had a very hard time of it between my father and me That seeing my dislike she had more than once pleaded for me but all to no purpose She was only treated as a too fond mother who from motives of a blameable indulgence  would encourage a child to stand in opposition to a father's will She was charged she said with dividing the family into two parts she and her youngest daughter standing against her husband his two brothers her son her eldest daughter and her sister Hervey She had been told that she must be convinced of the fitness as well as advantage to the whole my brother and Mr Lovelace out of the question of carrying the contract with Mr Solmes on which so  many  contracts depended into execution'  She repeated  'That my father's heart was in it That he had declared he had rather have no daughter in me than one he could not dispose of for her own good Especially as I had owned that my  heart was free  and as the general good of his whole family was to be promoted by my obedience That he had pleaded that his frequent gouty paroxysms every Fit more threatening than the former gave him no extraordinary prospects either of worldly happiness or of long days That he hoped that I who had been supposed to have contributed to the lengthening of his  father  's life would not by my disobedience shorten  his  '  This was a most affecting plea my dear I wept in silence upon it I could not speak to it And my mamma proceeded  'What therefore could be  his  motives she asked in the earnest desire he had to see this treaty perfected but the welfare and aggrandizement of his family which already having fortunes to become the highest condition could not but aspire to greater distinctions That however slight such views as these might appear to me I knew that they were not slight ones to any other of the family And my papa would be his own judge of what was and what was not likely to promote the good of his children That my abstractedness affectation of abstractedness some called it  savour'd of greater particularity than what they aim'd to carry That modesty and humility would therefore oblige me rather to mistrust myself of  peculiarity  than censure views which all the world pursued as opportunity offer'd'  I was still silent and she proceeded  'That it was owing to the good opinion which my papa had of me and of my prudence duty and gratitude that he had engaged for my compliance in my absence before I return'd from Miss Howe and had built and finished contracts upon it that could not be made void or cancelled'  But why then thought I did they receive me on my return from Miss Howe with so much intimidating solemnityTo be sure this argument as well as the rest was obtruded upon my mamma  She went on  'That my papa had declar'd that my unexpected opposition  unexpected  she was pleased to call it and Mr Lovelace's continued menaces and insults more and more convinc'd him that a short day was necessary in order to put an end to all that man's hopes and to his own apprehensions resulting from the disobedience of a child so favour'd That he had therefore actually order'd patterns of the richest silks to be sent for from London  I startedI was out of breathI gasped at this frightful precipitance I was going to open with warmth against it I knew whose the  happy  expedient must be Female minds I once heard my brother say that could but be brought to  balance  on the change of their state might easily be  determined  by the glare and splendor of the nuptial preparations and the pride of becoming the mistress of a familyBut she was pleased to hurry on that I might not have time to express my disgusts at such a communicationto this effect  'That neither for my sake nor his own could my father labour under a suspense so affecting to  his repose That he had even thought fit to acquaint  her  on her pleading for me that it became her as she valued her own peace How harsh to such a wife and as she wished that he should not suspect that she secretly favoured the address of a vile rake a character which all the sex he was pleased to say virtuous and vicious were but too fond of to exert her authority over me And that This she might the less scrupulously do as I had own'd the old string  that my heart was free  '  Unworthy reflection This of our sex's valuing a libertine in my mamma's case surely who made choice of my papa in preference to several suitors of equal fortune because they were of inferior reputation for morals  She added  'That my papa had left her at going out with this command That if she found that she had not the proper influence over me she should directly separate herself from me and leave me singly to take the consequence of my double disobedience'  She therefore intreated me in the most earnest and condescending manner  'To signify to my papa on his return my ready obedience And this she was pleased to say as well for  her  sake as  mine  '  Affected by my mamma's goodness to me and by that part of her argument which related to her own peace and to the suspicions they had of her secretly inclining to prefer the man so hated by  them  to the man so much  my  aversion I could not but wish it were possible for me to obey I therefore paused hesitated consider'd and was silent for a considerable space I could see that my mamma hoped that the result of this hesitation would be favourable to her arguments But then recollecting that all was owing to the instigations of a brother and sister wholly actuated by selfish and envious views That I had not deserved the treatment I had of late met with That my disgrace was  already  become the  public talk That my aversion to their man was too generally known to make my compliance either creditable to myself or to them as it would demonstrate less of duty than of a slavish and even of a sordid mind seeking to preserve its worldly fortunes by the sacrifice of its future happiness That it would give my brother and sister a triumph over me and over Mr Lovelace which they would not fail to glory in and which altho' it concern'd me but little to matter on  his  account yet might be attended with fatal mischiefsAnd then Mr Solmes's disagreeable person his still more disagreeable manners his low understandingUnderstanding the glory of a man so little to be dispensed with in the head and director of a family in order to preserve to him that respect which a good wife and that for the justification of her own choice should pay him herself and wish everybody to pay himAnd as Mr Solmes's  inferiority  in this respectable faculty of the human mind I must be allowed to say this to you and no great selfassumption neither would proclaim to all future as well as present observers what must have been my mean inducementAll these reflections which are ever present with me crouding upon my remembrance I would Madam said I folding my hands with an earnestness that my whole heart was ingaged in bear the cruellest tortures bear loss of limb and even of life to give  you  peace But this man every moment I would at your command think of him with favour is the more my aversion You cannot indeed you cannot think how my whole soul resists himAnd to talk of contracts concluded upon of patterns of a short daysave me save me O my dearest mamma save your child from this heavy from this insupportable evil  Never was there a countenance that express'd so significantly as my mamma's an anguish which she struggled to hide under an anger she was compelled  to assumeTill the latter overcoming the former she turned from me with an uplifted eye and stamping  Strange perverseness  were the only words I heard of a sentence that she angrily pronounced and was going I then half franticly I believe laid hold of her gownHave patience with me dearest Madam said IDo not  you  renounce me totallyIf you  must  separate yourself from your child let it not be with  absolute  reprobation on  your own  partMy uncles may be hardheartedMy papa may be immoveableI may suffer from my brother's ambition and from my sister's envyBut let me not lose my mamma's love at least her pity  She turned to me with benigner raysYou  have  my love You  have  my  pity  But O my dearest girlI have not  yours    Indeed indeed Madam you have And all my reverence all my gratitude you haveBut in this  one  pointCannot I be this  once  obligedWill no  expedient  be accepted Have I not made a very fair proposal as to the man so hated  I wish for both our sakes my dear unpersuadable girl that the decision of this point lay with me But why when you know it don't should you thus perplex and urge meTo renounce Mr Lovelace is now but  half  what is aimed at Nor will anybody else believe you in earnest in the offer if  I  would While you remain single Mr Lovelace will have hopesand you in the opinion of others inclinations  Permit me dearest Madam to say That  your  goodness to me  your  patience  your  peace weigh more with me than all the rest put together For altho' I am to be treated by my brother and thro' his instigations by my papa as a slave in this point and not as a daughter yet my mind is not that of a slave You have not brought me up to be mean  So Clary you are already at defiance with your  papa I have had too much cause before to  apprehend  as muchWhat will this come to  I  and then my dear mamma sigh'd  I  am forced to put up with many humours  That you are my everhonour'd mamma is my grief And can it be thought that this very consideration and the apprehension of what may result from a much  worse  temper'd man a man who has not half the sense of my papa has not made an impression upon me to the disadvantage of the marry'd life Yet 'tis something of an alleviation if one must bear  undue  controul to bear it from a man of sense My papa I have heard you say Madam was for years a very goodhumour'd gentlemanUnobjectible in person and mannersBut the man proposed to me  Forbear reflecting upon your papa Did I my dear in what I have repeated and I think they are the very words reflect upon my papa It is not possible I must say again and again were all men  equally  indifferent to you that you should be thus sturdy in your willI am tired out with your obstinacyThe most unper  suade  able girlYou forget that I must separate myself from you if you will not comply You do not remember that your papa will take you up where I leave youOnce more however I will put it to youAre you determin'd to brave your papa's displeasureAre you determin'd to defy your unclesWill you choose to break with us all rather than encourage Mr SolmesRather than give me hope  Cruel alternativeBut is not my sincerity is not the integrity of my heart concerned in my answer May not my everlasting happiness be the sacrifice Will not the least shadow of the  hope  you just now demanded from me be driven into absolute and sudden  certainty  Is it not sought to insnare to intangle me in my own desire of obeying if I could  give answers that might be construed into  hope  Forgive me Madam Bear with your child's boldness in such a cause as ThisSettlements drawnPatterns sent forAn early dayDear dear Madam how can I give hope and not intend to be this man's  Ah girl never say your  heart is free  You deceive yourself if you think it is  Thus to be driven and I wrung my hands thro' impatience by the instigations of a designing an ambitious brother and by a sister that  How often Clary must I forbid your unsisterly reflectionsDoes not your father do not your uncles does not everybody patronize Mr SolmesAnd let me tell you ungrateful girl and unmoveable as ungrateful let me repeatedly tell you that it is evident to me that nothing but a love unworthy of your prudence can make a creature late so dutiful so sturdy You may guess what your father's first question on his return will be He must know that I can do nothing with you I have done my part Seek  me  if your mind change before he comes back You have yet a little more time as he stays supper I will no more seek  you  nor  to  youAnd away she flung  What could I do but weep  I am extremely affected on my mamma's accountmore I must needs say than on my ownAnd indeed all things consider'd and especially that the measure she is engaged in is as I dare say it is against her own judgment she  deserves  more compassion than myselfExcellent woman What pity that meekness and condescension should not be attended with the due rewards of those charming gracesYet had she not let violent spirits as I have elsewhere observed with no small regret have found their power over hers it could not have been thus  But here run away with by my pen I suffer my dear mamma to be angry with me on her own account She hinted to me indeed that I must seek  her  if my  mind  changed  which is a condition that amounts to a prohibitionBut as she left me in displeasure will it not have a very obstinate appearance and look like a a kind of renunciation of her mediation in my favour if I go not down to supplicate her pity and her kind report before my papa comes back  I will attend her I had rather all the world should be angry with me than my mamma  Mean time to clear my hands from papers of such a nature Hannah shall deposite this If two or three letters reach you together they will but express from one period to another the anxieties and difficulties which the mind of your unhappy but ever affectionate friend labours under  CL H  LETTER XXI Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Sat Night  I HAVE been down I  am  to be unlucky in all I do I think be my intention ever so good I have made matters worse instead of better as I shall now tell you  I found my mamma and sister together in my sister's parlour My mamma I fear by the glow in her fine face and as the browner sullener glow in my sister's confirm'd had been expressing herself with warmth against her  unhappier  child Perhaps giving such an account of what had passed as should clear herself and convince Bella and thro'  her  my brother and uncles of the sincere pains she had taken with me  I enter'd like a dejected criminal I believeand besought the favour of a private audience My mamma's return both looks and words gave but too much reason for my surmize  You have said she looking at me with a sternness that never sits well on her sweet features rather a  requesting  than a  conceding  countenance Clarissa Harlowe If I am mistaken tell me so and I will withdraw with you whereever you willYet if so or not so you may say what you have to say before your sister  My mamma I thought might have withdrawn with me as she knows that I have not a friend in my sister  I came down I said to beg of her to forgive me for anything she might have taken amiss in what had passed above respecting herself and to use her interest to soften my papa's displeasure when she made the report she was to make to him  Such aggravating looks such liftingup of hands and eyes such a furrow'd forehead in my sister  My mamma was angry enough without all that and asked me To what purpose I came down if I were still so untractable  She had hardly spoke the words when Shorey came in to tell her that Mr Solmes was in the hall and desired admittance  Ugly creature What at the close of day quite dark brought him hitherBut on second thoughts I believe it was contrived that he should be here at supper to know the result of the conference between my mamma and me and that my papa on his return might find us together  I was hurrying away but my mamma commanded me since I had come down only as she said to mock her not to stir and at the same time see if I could behave so to him as might encourage her to make the report to my papa which I had so earnestly besought her to make  My sister triumphed I was vexed to be so caught and to have such an angry and cutting rebuke given me with an aspect more like the taunting sister than the indulgent mother if I may presume to say so  For my mamma herself seem'd to enjoy the surprize upon me  The man stalked in His usual walk is by pauses as if from the same vacuity of thought which made Dryden's clown whistle he was telling his steps and first paid his clumsy respects to my mamma then to my sister next to me as if I were already his wife and therefore to be last in his notice and sitting down by me told us in general what weather it was Very cold he made it but I was warm enough Then addressing himself to me And how do  you  find it Miss was his question and would have took my hand  I withdrew it I believe with disdain enough My mamma frown'd my sister bit her lip  I could not contain myself I never was so bold in my life for I went on with my plea as if Mr Solmes had not been there  My mamma colour'd and look'd at him look'd at my sister and look'd at me My sister's eyes were opener and bigger than ever I saw them before  The man understood me He hemm'd and remov'd from one chair to another  I went on supplicating for my mamma's favourable report Nothing but invincible dislike  What would the girl be at Why ClaryIs this a subjectIs thisIs thisIs this a timeAnd again she look'd upon Mr Solmes  I am sorry on reflection that I put my mamma into so much confusionTo be sure it was very saucy in me  I begg'd pardon But my papa I said would return I should have no other opportunity I thought it was requisite since I was not permitted to withdraw that Mr Solmes's presence should not deprive me of an opportunity of such importance for me to embrace and at the same time if he still visited on my account looking at him to shew that it could not possibly be to any purpose  Is the girl mad said my mamma interrupting me  My sister with the affectation of a whisper to my mammaThis isThis is  spite  Madam very  spitefully  she spoke the word because you commanded her to stay  I only looked at her and turning to my mamma Permit me Madam said I to repeat my request I have no brother no sisterIf I lose my mamma's favour I am lost for ever  Mr Solmes removed to his first seat and fell to gnawing the head of his hazel a carved head almost as ugly as his own I did not think the man was so  sensible    My sister rose with a face all over scarlet and stepping to the table where lay a fan she took it up and altho' Mr Solmes had observ'd that the weather was cold fann'd herself very violently  My mamma came to me and angrily taking my hand led me out of that parlour into my own which you know is next to itIs not this behaviour very bold very provoking think you Clary  I beg your pardon Madam if it has that appearance to you But indeed my dear mamma there seem to be snares laying for me Too well I know my brother's drift With a good word he shall have my consent for all he wishes to worm me out ofNeither he nor my sister shall need to take half this pains  My mamma was about to leave me in high displeasure  I besought her to stay One favour but one favour dearest Madam said I give me leave to beg of you  What would the girl  I see how every thing is working aboutI never never can think of Mr Solmes My papa will be in tumults when he is told that I cannot They will judge of the tenderness of your heart to a poor child who seems devoted by everyone else from the willingness you have already shewn to hearken to my  prayers There will be endeavours used to confine me and keep me out of your presence and out of the presence of every one who used to love meThis my dear is threaten'dIf This be effected if it be put out of my power to plead my own cause and to appeal to You and to my uncle Harlowe of whom only I have hopethen will every ear be open'd against me and every tale encourag'dIt is therefore my humble request That added to the disgraceful prohibitions I now suffer under you will not if you can help it give way to my being deny'd your ear  Your listening Hannah has given you this intelligence as she does many others  My Hannah Madam listens notMy Hannah  No more in her behalfShe is known to make mischiefShe is knownBut no more of that busy intermeddler'Tis true your father threaten'd to confine you to your chamber if you comply'd not in order the more assuredly to deprive you of the opportunity of corresponding with those who harden your heart against his will He bid me tell you so when he went out if I found you refractory But I was loth to deliver so harsh a declaration being still in hope that you would come down to us in a compliant temperHannah has overheard this I suppose and has told you of it as also that he declar'd he would break your heart rather than you should break his And I now assure you that you will be confin'd and prohibited making teazing appeals to any of us And we shall see who is to submit You or everybody  to  you  I offer'd to clear Hannah and to lay the latter part of the intelligence to my sister's echo Betty Barnes who had boasted of it to another servant But I was again bid to be silent on that head I should soon find she was pleased to say that  others  could be as determin'd  as I was obstinate And once for all would add that since she saw that I built upon her indulgence and matter'd not involving her in contentions with my father and his brothers and her other children she would now assure me that she was as much determin'd  against  Mr Lovelace and  for  Mr Solmes and the familyschemes as anybody and would not refuse her consent to any measures that should be thought necessary to reduce a stubborn child to her duty  I was ready to sink She was so good as to lend me her arm to support me  And this is all I have to hope for from my mamma  It is But Clary this one further opportunity I give youGo in again to Mr Solmes and behave discreetly to him and let your papa find you together upon  civil  terms at least  My feet moved of themselves I think farther from the parlour where he was and towards the stairs and there I stopp'd and paused  If proceeded she you are determin'd to stand in defiance of us allthen indeed may you go up to your chamber as you are ready to doAnd God help you  God help me indeed for I cannot give hope of what I cannot intendBut let me have your prayers my dear mammaThose shall have mine who have brought me into all this distress  I was moving to go up  And  will  you go up Clary  I turn'd my face to her My officious tears would needs plead for me I could not just then speak and stood still  Good girl distress me not thusDear good girl do not thus distress meholding out her hand but standing still likewise  What can I do MadamWhat  can  I do  Go in again my childGo in again my  dear  childrepeated she and let your papa find you together  What Madam to give  him  hopeTo give hope to Mr Solmes  Obstinate perverse undutiful Clarissa Harlowe with a rejecting hand and angry aspect then take your own way and go upBut stir not down again I charge you without leave or till your papa's pleasure be known concerning you  She flung from me with high indignation And I went up with a very heavy heart and feet as slow as my heart was heavy  MY father is come home and my brother with him Late as it is they are all shut up together Not a door opens not a soul stirs Hannah as she moves up and down is shunn'd as a person infected  THE angry assembly is broke up My two uncles and my aunt Hervey are sent for it seems to be here in the morning to breakfast I shall then I suppose know my doom 'Tis past eleven and I am order'd not to go to bed  Twelve o' clock  THIS moment the keys of every thing are taken from me It was proposed to send for me down But my papa said he could not bear to look upon meStrange alteration in a few weeks Shorey was the messenger The tears stood in her eyes when she deliver'd her message  You my dear are happyMay you always be soAnd then I can never be wholly miserable Adieu my beloved friend  CL HARLOWE  LETTER XXII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Sunday morning March  HANNAH has just brought me from the private place in the gardenwall a letter from Mr Lovelace deposited last night signed also by Lord M  He tells me in it  'That Mr Solmes makes it his boast that he is to be marry'd in a few days to one of the shyest women in England That my brother explains his meaning to be me assuring everyone that his youngest sister is very soon to be Mr Solmes's wife He tells me of the patterns bespoke which my mamma mention'd to me'  Not one thing escapes him that is done or said in this house  'My sister he says reports the same things and that with such particular aggravations of insult upon  him  that he cannot but be extremely piqued as well at the manner as from the occasion and expresses himself with great violence upon it  'He knows not what my relations inducements can be to prefer such a man as Solmes to him If advantageous settlements be the motive Solmes shall not offer what he will refuse to comply with  'As to his estate or family the first cannot be excepted against And for the second he will not disgrace himself by a comparison so odious He appeals to Lord M for the regularity of his life and manners ever since he has made his addresses to me or had hope of my favour'  I suppose he would have his Lordship's signing to this letter to be taken as a voucher for him  'He desires my leave in company with my Lord in a pacific manner to attend my father or uncles in order to make proposals that must be accepted if they will but see him and hear what they are  And tells me that he will submit to any measures that I shall prescribe in order to bring about a reconciliation'  He presumes to be very earnest with me  'to give him a private meeting some night in my father's garden attended by whom I please'  Really my dear were you to see his letter you would think I had given him great encouragement and were in direct treaty with him or that he were sure that my friends would drive me into a foreign protection for he has the boldness to offer in my Lord's name an asylum to me should I be tyrannically treated in Solmes's behalf  I suppose it is the way of this sex to endeavour to intangle the thoughtless of ours by bold supposals and offers in hopes that we shall be too complaisant or bashful to quarrel with them and if not check'd to reckon upon our silence as assents voluntarily given or concessions made in their favour  There are other particulars in this letter which I ought to mention to you But I will take an opportunity to send you the letter itself or a copy of it  For my own part I am very uneasy to think how I have been  drawn  on one hand and  driven  on the other into a clandestine in short into a mere Loverlike correspondence which my heart condemns  It is easy to see that if I do not break it off Mr Lovelace's advantages by reason of my unhappy situation will every day increase and I shall be more and more intangled Yet if I do put an end to it without making it a condition of being freed from Mr Solmes's addressMay I my dear is it best to continue it a little longer in hopes by giving him up to extricate myself out of the other difficultyWhose advice can I now ask but yours  All my relations are met They are at breakfast together Solmes is expected I am excessively uneasy I must lay down my pen  THEY are all going to church together Grievously disorder'd they appear to be as Hannah tells me She believes something is resolved upon  Sunday noon  WHAT a cruel thing is suspenseI will ask leave to go to church this afternoon I expect to be deny'd But if I do not ask they may allege that my not going is owing to my self  I desired to speak with Shorey Shorey came I directed her to carry my request to my mamma for permission to go to church this afternoon What think you was the return Tell her that she must direct herself to her brother for any favour she has to askSo my dear I am to be deliver'd up to my brother  I was resolved however to ask of  him  this favour Accordingly when they sent me up my solitary dinner I gave the messenger a billet in which I made it my humble request to my papa thro' him to be permitted to go to church this afternoon  This was the contemptuous answer Tell her that her request will be taken into consideration  tomorrow  My request to go to church  today  to be taken into consideration  tomorrow    Patience will be the fittest return I can make to such an insult But this method will not do indeed it will not with your Clarissa Harlowe And yet it is but the beginning I suppose of what I am to expect from my brother now I am delivered up to him  ON recollection I thought it best to renew my request I did The following is a copy of what I wrote and what follows that of the answer sent me  SIR  I KNOW not what to make of the answer brought to my request of being permitted to go to church this afternoon If you designed to shew your pleasantry by it I hope that will continue and then my request will be granted You know that I never absented myself when well and at home till the two last Sundays when I was  advised  not to go My present situation is such that I never more wanted the benefit of the public prayers I will solemnly engage only to go thither and back again I hope it cannot be thought that I would do otherwise My dejection of spirits will give a too just excuse on the score of indisposition for avoiding visits Nor will I but by distant civilities return the compliments of any of my acquaintance My disgraces if they are to have an end need not to be proclaim'd to the whole world I ask this favour therefore for my reputation's sake that I may be able to hold up my head in the neighbourhood if I live to see an end of the unmerited severities which seem to be designed for  Your unhappy sister CL HARLOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    FOR a girl to lay so much stress upon going to church and yet resolve to defy her parents in an article of the greatest consequence to them and to the whole family is an absurdity You are recommended Miss to the practice of your  private  devotions May  they  be efficacious upon the mind of one of the most pervicacious young creatures that ever was heard of The in  ten  tion is I tell you plainly to mortify you into a sense of your duty The neighbours you are so sollicitous to appear well with already know that you defy  that  So Miss if you have a  real value for your reputation shew it as you ought It is yet in your own power to establish or impair it  JA HARLOWE  Thus my dear has my brother got me into his snares and I like a poor silly bird the more I struggle am the more intangled  LETTER XXIII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Mond morning Mar  THEY are resolv'd to break my heart My poor Hannah is dischargeddisgracefully dischargedThus it was  Half an hour after I had sent the poor girl down for my breakfast that bold creature Betty Barnes my sister's confident and servant if a favourite maid and confident can be deemed a  servant  came up  What Miss will you please to have for breakfast  I was surpris'd What will I have for breakfast BettyHowWhatHow comes itThen I named HannahI could not tell what to say  Don't be surpris'd MissBut you'll see Hannah no more in this house  God forbidIs any harm come to HannahWhat What is the matter with Hannah  Why Miss the short and the long is this Your papa and mamma think Hannah has staid long enough in the house to do mischief and so she is order'd to  troop  that was the confident creature's word and I am directed to wait upon you  I burst into tearsI have no service for you Betty Barnes none at allBut where is HannahCannot I speak with the poor girl I owe her half a year's wages May I not see the honest creature and pay her her wagesI may never see her again perhaps for they are resolv'd to break my heart  And they think you are resolv'd to break theirs So tit for tat Miss  Impertinent I call'd her and ask'd her if it were upon such confident terms that her service was to commence  I was so very earnest to see the poor maid that to oblige me as she said she went down with my request  The worthy creature was as earnest to see me and the favour was granted in presence of Shorey and Betty  I thank'd her when she came up for her past service to me  Her heart was ready to break And she fell a vindicating her fidelity and love and disclaiming any mischief she had ever made  I told her that those who occasion'd her being turn'd out of my service made no question of her integrity That it was an indignity level'd at me That I was very sorry for it and hoped she would meet with as good a service  Never never wringing her hands a mistress she loved so well And the poor creature ran on in my praises and in professions of love to me  We are all apt you know my dear to praise our benefactors because they  are  our benefactors as if everybody did right or wrong as they obliged or disobliged  us  But this good creature  deserved  to be kindly treated so I could have no merit in favouring one whom it would have been ingrateful not to distinguish  I gave her a little linen some laces and other odd things and instead of four pounds which were due to her ten guineas And said If ever I were again allow'd to be my own mistress I would think of  her  in the first place  Betty enviously whisper'd Shorey upon it  Hannah told me before their faces having no other  opportunity that she had been examin'd about letters  to  me and  from  me And that she had given her pockets to Miss Harlowe who look'd into them and put her fingers in her stays to satisfy herself that she had not any  She gave me an account of the number of my pheasants and bantams and I said they should be my own care twice or thrice a day  We wept over each other at parting The girl pray'd for all the family  To have so good a servant so disgracefully dismissed is a cutting thing And I could not help saying That these methods might break my heart but not any other way answer the end of the authors of my disgraces  Betty with a very saucy fleer said to Shorey There would be a trial of skill about that she fancy'd But I took no notice of it If this wench thinks I have robbed her young mistress of a lover as you say she has given out she may think it a merit in herself to be impertinent to me  Thus have I been forced to part with my faithful Hannah If you can commend the good creature to a place worthy of her pray do for my sake  LETTER XXIV Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Mond near o'Clock  THE inclosed Letter is just now delivered to me My brother has now carried all his points  I send you also the copy of my answer No more at this time can I write  Mond March  Miss  CLARY  BY your papa's and mamma's command I write expresly to forbid you to come into their presence  or into the garden when they are there Nor when they are  not  there but with Betty Barnes to attend you except by particular licence or command  On their blessings you are forbidden likewise to correspond with the vile Lovelace as it is well known you did by means of your sly Hannah Whence her sudden discharge As was fit  Neither are you to correspond with Miss Howe who has given herself high airs of late and might possibly help on your correspondence with that libertine Nor in short with anybody without leave  You are not to enter into the presence of either of your uncles without their leave first obtained It is in mercy to you after such a behaviour to your mamma that your papa refuses to see you  You are not to be seen in any apartment of the house you so lately govern'd as you pleased unless you are commanded down  In short are strictly to confine yourself to your chamber except now and then in Betty Barnes's sight as aforesaid you take a morning and evening turn in the garden And then you are to go directly and without stopping at any apartment in the way up and down the backstairs that the sight of so perverse a young creature may not add to the pain you have given everybody  The hourly threatenings of your Lovelace as well as your own unheardof obstinacy will account to you for all this What a hand has the best and most indulgent of mothers had with you who so long pleaded for you and undertook for you even when others from the manner of your setting out despaired of moving youWhat must your perverseness have been that  such  a mother can give you up She thinks it right so to do Nor will take you to favour unless you make the first steps by a compliance with your duty  As for myself whom perhaps you think hardly  of in very good company if you do that is my consolation I have advised that you may be permitted to pursue your own inclinations Some people need no greater punishment than such a permission and not to have the house incumbered by one who must give them the more pain for the necessity she has laid them under of avoiding the sight of her altho' in it  If any thing I have written appear severe or harsh it is still in your power but perhaps will not always be so to remedy it and that by a single word  Betty Barnes has orders to obey you in all points consistent with her duty to those to whom  you  owe it as well as  she    JA HARLOWE  To  JAMES HARLOWE  junior  Esq  SIR  I WILL only say That you may congratulate yourself on having  so far  succeeded in all your views that you may report what you please of me and I can no more defend myself than if I were dead Yet one favour nevertheless I will beg of you It is thisThat you will not occasion more severities more disgraces than are necessary for carrying into execution your further designs whatever they be against  Your unhappy Sister CL HARLOWE  LETTER XXV Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Tues March  BY my last deposite you'll see how I am driven and what a poor prisoner I am No regard had to my reputation The whole matter is now before you Can  such  measures be supposed to softenBut  surely they can only mean to try to frighten me into my brother's viewsAll my hope is to be able to weather this point till my cousin Morden comes from Florence and he is expected soon Yet if they are determined upon a short day I doubt he will not be here time enough to save me  It is plain by my brother's letter that my mamma has not spared me in the report she has made of the conferences between herself and me Yet she was pleased to hint to me that my brother had views which she would have had me try to disappointBut she had engaged to give a  faithful  account of what was to pass between herself and me And it was doubtless much more eligible to give up a daughter than to disoblige a husband and every other person of the family  They think they have done everything by turning away my poor Hannah But as long as the liberty of the garden and my poultryvisits are allowed me they will be mistaken  I asked  Mrs Betty  If she had any orders to watch or attend me or Whether I were to ask  her  Leave whenever I should be disposed to walk in the garden or to go to feed my Bantams  Lord bless her what could I mean by such a questionYet she owned that she had heard that I was not to walk in the garden when my papa mamma or uncles were there  However as it behoved me to be assured on this head I went down directly and staid an hour without question or impediment And yet a good part of the time I walked under and in  sight  as I may say of my brother's Studywindow where both he and my sister happened to be And I am sure they saw me by the loud mirth they affected by way of insult as I suppose  So this part of my restraint was doubtless a stretch of the authority given him The inforcing of that may perhaps come next But I hope not  Tuesday night  SINCE I wrote the above I have ventured to send a letter by Shorey to my mamma I directed her to give it into her own hand when nobody was by  I shall inclose the copy of it You'll see that I would have it thought that now Hannah is gone I have no way to correspond out of the house I am far from thinking all I do right I am afraid this is a little piece of art that is  not  so But this is an afterthought The letter went first  Honoured Madam  HAVING acknowleged to you that I had received letters from Mr Lovelace full of resentment and that I answered them purely to prevent further mischief and having shew'd you copies of my answers which you did not disapprove of altho' you thought fit after you had read them to forbid me any further correspondence with him I think it my duty to acquaint you that another letter from him has since come to my hand in which he is very earnest with me to permit him to wait on my papa or you or my two uncles in a pacific way accompanied by Lord MOn which I beg your commands  I own to you Madam that had not the prohibition been renew'd and had not Hannah been so suddenly dismissed my service I should have made the less scruple to have written an answer and to have commanded her to convey it to him with all speed in order to dissuade him from these visits lest any thing should happen on the occasion that my heart akes but to think of  And here I cannot but express my grief that I should have all the punishment and all the blame who as I have reason to think have prevented great mischief and have not been the occasion of any For Madam could  I  be supposed to govern the passions of  either  of the gentlemenOver the one indeed  I have had some little influence without giving him hitherto any reason to think he has fasten'd an obligation upon me for itOver the other Who Madam has any  I am grieved at heart to be obliged to lay so great blame at my brother's door altho' my reputation and my liberty are both to be sacrific'd to his resentment and ambition May not however so deep a sufferer be permitted to speak out  This communication being as voluntarily made as dutifully intended I humbly presume to hope that I shall not be required to produce the letter itself I cannot either in honour or prudence do that because of the vehemence of his style for having heard not I assure you by my means or thro' Hannah's of some part of the harsh treatment I have met with he thinks himself intitled to place it to his own account by reason of speeches thrown out by some of my relations equally vehement  If I do  not  answer him he will be made desperate and think himself justified tho' I shall not think him so in resenting the treatment he complains of If I  do  and if in compliment to me he forbears to resent what he thinks himself intitled to resent be pleased Madam to consider the obligation he will suppose he lays me under  If I were as strongly prepossessed in his favour as is supposed I should not have wish'd this to be consider'd by youAnd permit me as a still further proof that I am  not  prepossessed to beg of you to consider Whether upon the whole the proposal I made of declareing for the Single Life which I will religiously adhere to is not the best way to get rid of his pretensions with honour To renounce him and not to be allowed to aver that I will never be the other man's will make him conclude driven as I am driven that I am determined in that other man's favour  If this has not its due weight my brother's strange  schemes must be try'd and I will resign myself to my destiny with all the acquiescence that shall be granted to my prayers And so leaving the whole to your own wisdom and whether you choose to consult my papa and uncles upon this humble application or not or whether I shall be allowed to write an answer to Mr Lovelace or not and if allow'd so to do I beg your direction by whom to send it I remain  Honoured Madam Your unhappy but everdutiful daughter CL HARLOWE  Wednesday morning  I have just received an answer to the inclosed letter My mamma you'll observe has ordered me to burn it But as you will have it in your safe keeping and nobody else will see it her end will be equally answer'd It has neither date nor superscription  CLARISSA  SAY not all the blame and all the punishment is yours I am as much blam'd and as much punish'd as you are yet am more innocent When your obstinacy is equal to any other person's passion blame not your brother We judg'd right that Hannah carry'd on your correspondencies Now she is gone and you cannot write we  think  you cannot to Miss Howe nor she to you without our knowlege one cause of uneasiness and jealousy is over  I had no dislike to Hannah I did not tell her so because Somebody was within hearing when she desired to pay her duty to me at going I gave her a caution in a raised voice To take care whereever she went to live next if there were any young Ladies how she made parties and assisted in clandestine correspondenciesBut I slid two guineas into her hand  Nor was I angry to hear you were  more  bountiful to herSo much for Hannah  I don't know what to write about your answ  ing that man of violence What can you think of it that such a family as ours should have such a rod held over itFor my part I have not own'd that I know you  have  corresponded By your last boldness to me an astonishing one it was to pursue before Mr Solmes the subject that I was forced to break from above stairs you may as far as I know plead that you had my countenance for your correspondence with him and so add to the uneasiness between your papa and me You was once all my comfort You made all my hardships tolerableBut nowHowever nothing it is plain can move you and I will say no more on that head For you are under your papa's discipline now and he will neither be prescribed to nor intreated  I should have been glad to see the letter you tell me of as I saw the restYou say both honour and prudence forbid you to shew it meO Clarissa what think you of receiving letters that honour and prudence forbid you to shew to a motherBut it is not for me to see it if you would  choose  to shew it me I will not be in your secret I will not know that you did correspond And as to an answer take your own methods But let him know it will be the last you will write And if you do write I won't see it So seal it up if you do and give it to Shorey and sheYet do not think I give you licence to write  We will be upon no conditions with him nor will  you  be allow'd to be upon any Your papa and uncles would have no patience were he to come What have  you  to do to oblige him with your refusal of Mr SolmesWill not That refusal be to give  him  hope And while he has any can  we  be easy or free from his insults Were even your brother in  fault  as  that fault cannot be conquer'd is a sister to carry on a correspondence that shall endanger her brother But your papa has given his sanction to your brother's dislikes and they are now your papa's dislikes and my dislikes your uncles and everybody'sNo matter to  whom  owing  As to the rest you have by your obstinacy put it out of my power to do anything for you Your papa takes upon himself to be answerable for all consequences You must not therefore apply to me for any favour I shall endeavour to be only an observer Happy if I could be an unconcerned oneWhile I had power you would not let me use it as I  would  have used it Your aunt has been forced to engage not to interfere but by your papa's direction You'll have severe trials If you have any favour to hope for it must be from the mediation of your uncles And yet I believe they are equally determin'd For they make it a principleAlas they never had children that that child who in marriage is not govern'd by her parents is to be given up as a lost creature  I charge you let not this letter be found Burn it There is too much of the  mother  in it to a daughter so unaccountably obstinate  Write not another letter to me I can do nothing for you But you can do every thing for yourself  Now my dear to proceed with my melancholy narrative  After this letter you will believe that I could have very little hopes that an application directly to my father would stand me in any stead But I thought it became me to write were it but to acquit myself  to  myself that I have left nothing unattempted that has the least likelihood to restore me to his favour Accordingly I wrote to the following effect  'I presume not I say to argue with my papa I  only beg his mercy and indulgence in this  one  point on which depends my present and perhaps my  future  happiness and beseech him not to reprobate his child for an aversion which it is not in her power to conquer I beg that I may not be sacrific'd to projects and remote contingencies I complain of the disgraces I suffer in this banishment from his presence and in being confined to my chamber In every thing but this  one  point I promise implicit duty and resignation to his will I repeat my offers of a Single Life and appeal to him whether I have ever given him cause to doubt my word I beg to be admitted to his and to my mamma's presence and that my conduct may  e under their own eye And this with the more earnestness as I have too much reason to believe that snares are laid for me and tauntings and revilings used on purpose to make a handle of my words against me when I am not permitted to speak in my own defence I conclude with hoping that my brother's instigations may not rob an unhappy child of her father'  This is the cruel answer sent without superscription and unsealed altho' by Betty Barnes who delivered it with an air as if she knew the contents  Wednesday  I Write perverse girl but with all the indignation that your disobedience deserves To desire to be forgiven a fault you own and yet resolve to persevere in is a boldness no more to be equall'd than passed over It is  my  authority you defy Your reflections upon a brother that is an honour to us all deserve my utmost resentment I see how light all relationship sits upon  you  The  cause  I guess at too I cannot bear the reflections that naturally arise from this consideration Your behaviour to your too indulgent and too fond motherBut I have no patience  Continue banished from my presence undutiful as you are till you know how to conform to my will Ingrateful creature Your letter but upbraids me for my past indulgence Write no more to me till you can distinguish better and till you are convinc'd of your duty to  A justly incensed Father  This angry letter was accompany'd with one from my mamma unsealed and unsuperscribed also Those who take so much pains to confederate every one against me I make no doubt obliged her to bear her testimony against the poor girl  This letter being a repetition of some of the severe things that passed between my mamma and me of which I have given you an account I shall not need to give you the contentsOnly thus far that  she  also praises my brother and blames me for my freedoms with him  LETTER XXVI Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Thursd morn Mar  I Have another letter from Mr Lovelace altho' I had not answer'd his former  This man some how or other knows every thing that passes in our family My confinement Hannah's dismission and more of the resentments and resolutions of my father uncles and brother than I can possibly know and almost as soon as things happen He cannot come at these intelligences fairly  He is excessively uneasy upon what he hears and his expressions both of love to me and resentment to them are very fervent He sollicits me much  'To engage my honour to him Never to have Mr  Solmes'  I think I may fairly promise him that I will not  He begs  'That I will not think he is endeavouring to make to himself a  merit  at any man's expence since he hopes to obtain my favour on the foot of his  own  nor that he seeks to  intimidate  me into a consideration for him But declares that the treatment he meets with from my family is so intolerable that he is perpetually reproached for not resenting it and that as well by Lord M and his two aunts as by all his other friends And if he must have no hope from me he cannot answer for what his despair will make him do'  Indeed he says his relations the Ladies particularly advise him to have recourse to a  legal  remedy  'But how he asks can a man of honour go to law for verbal abuses given by people intitled to wear swords'  You see my dear that my mamma seems as apprehensive of mischief as I and has indirectly offer'd to let Shorey carry my answer to the letter he sent me before  He is full of the favour of the Ladies of his family to me To whom nevertheless I am personally a stranger except that once I saw Miss Patty Montague at Mrs Knollys's  It is natural I believe for a person to be the more desirous of making new friends in proportion as she loses the favour of old ones Yet had I rather appear amiable in the eyes of my own relations and in your eyes than in those of all the world besidesBut these four Ladies of his family have such excellent characters that one cannot but wish to be thought well of by them Cannot there be a way to find out by Mrs Fortescue's means or by Mr Hickman who has some knowlege of Lord M covertly however what their opinions are of the present situation of things in our family and of the little likelihood there  is that ever the alliance once approved of by them can take effectI cannot for my own part think so well of myself as to imagine that they can wish him to persevere in his views with regard to me through such contempts and discouragementsNot that it would concern me should they advise him to the contraryBy my Lord's signing Mr Lovelace's former letter by Mr Lovelace's assurances of the continued favour of all his relations and by the report of others I seem to stand still high in their favour But methinks I would be glad to have this confirmed to me as from themselves by the lips of an indifferent person and the rather as they are known to put a value upon their alliance fortunes and family and take it amiss as they have reason to be included by  ours  in the contempt thrown upon their kinsman  Curiosity at present is all my motive Nor will there ever I hope be a stronger notwithstanding your questionable  throbs  Even were Mr Lovelace to be less exceptionable than he is  I have answer'd his letters If he take me at my word I shall need to be the less sollicitous for his relations opinions in my favour And yet one would be glad to be well thought of by the worthy This is the substance of my letter  'I express my surprize at his knowing and so early all that passes here I assure him That were there not such a man in the world as himself I would not have Mr Solmes'  I tell him  'That to return as I understand he does defiances for defiances to my relations is far from being a proof with me either of his politeness or of the consideration he pretends to have for me  'That the moment I hear he visits any of my friends without their consent I will make a resolution never to see him more if I can help it'  I apprise him  'That I am conniv'd at in sending  this letter altho' no one has seen the contents provided it shall be the last I will ever write to him That I had more than once told him that the Single Life was my choice And this before Mr Solmes was introduced as a visitor in our family That Mr Wyerley and other gentlemen knew it well to be my choice before  he  was acquainted with any of us That I had never been induced to receive a line from him on the subject but that I thought he had not acted ungenerously by my brother and yet had not been so handsomely treated by my friends as he might have expected That had he even my friends of his side I should have very great objections to him were I to get over my choice of a Single Life so really preferable to me as it is and that I should have declared as much to him had I reg  rded him as more than a common visitor On all these accounts I desire that the one more letter which I will allow him to deposite in the usual place may be the very  last  and That only to acquaint me with his acquiescence that it shall be so at least till happier times'  This last I put in that he may not he quite desperate But if he take me at my word I shall be rid of one of my tormentors  I have promised to lay before you all his letters and my answers I repeat that promise And am the less sollicitous for that reason to amplify upon the contents of either But I cannot too often express my vexation to be driven to such streights and difficulties here at home as oblige me to answer letters from a man I had not absolutely intended to encourage and had really great objections to filled as  his  are with such warm protestations and written to me with a spirit of expectation  For my dear you never knew so bold a supposer As commentators find beauties in an author which the author perhaps was a stranger to so he sometimes compliments me in high strains of gratitude for  favours and for a consideration which I never designed him insomuch that I am frequently under a necessity of explaining away the attributed goodness which if I shew'd him I should have the less opinion of myself  In short my dear like a restiff horse he pains one's hands and half disjoints one's arms to rein him in And when you see his letters you must form no judgment upon them till you have read my answers If you do you will indeed think you have cause to attribute  selfdeceit  and  throbs  and  glows  to your friendAnd yet at other times the contradictory creature complains that I shew him as little favour and my friends as much inveteracy as if in the rencounter betwixt my brother and him he had been the aggressor and as if the catastrophe had been as fatal as it might have been  If he has a design by this conduct sometimes complaining of my shyness at others exulting in my imaginary favours to induce me at one time to acquiesce with his compliments at another to be more complaisant for his complaints and if the contradiction be not the effect of his inattention and giddiness I shall think him as deep and as artful too probably as  practised  a creature as ever lived and were I to be sure of it should hate him if possible worse than I do Solmes  But enough for the present of a creature so very various  LETTER XXVII Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Thursday night March  I Have no patience with any of the people you are with I know not what to advise you to do How do you know that you are not punishable for  being the cause tho' to your own loss that the will of your grandfather is not comply'd withWills are sacred things child You see that they even  they  think so who imagine they suffer by a will thro' the distinction paid you in it  I allow of all your noble reasonings for what you did at the time But since such a charming such a generous instance of filial duty is to go thus unrewarded Why should you not resume  Your grandfather knew the familyfailing He knew what a noble spirit you had to do goodHe himself perhaps excuse me my dear had done too little in his lifetime and therefore he put it in your power to make up for the defects of the whole family Were it to me I would resume it Indeed I would  You will say you cannot do it while you are with them I don't know that Do you think they can use you worse than they doAnd is it not your  right  And do they not make use of your own generosity to oppress you Your uncle Harlowe is one trustee your cousin Morden is the other Insist upon your right to your uncle and write to your cousin Morden about it This I dare say will make them alter their behaviour to you  Your insolent brother what has  he  to do to controul youWere it me I wish it were for one month and no more I'd shew him the difference I'd be in my own mansion pursuing my charming schemes and making all around me happy I'd set up my own chariot I'd visit them when they deserv'd it But when my brother and sister gave themselves airs I'd let them know that I was their sister and not their servant And if that did not do I would shut my gates against them and bid them be company for each other  It must be confess'd however that this brother and sister of yours judging as such narrow spirits will  ever judge have some reason for treating you as they do It must have long been a mortifying consideration to them set disappointed love on her side and avarice on his out of the question to be so much eclipsed by a younger sisterSuch a sun in a family where there are none but faint twinklers How could they bear itWhy my dear they must look upon you as a prodigy among them And prodigies you know tho' they obtain our admiration never attract our love The distance between you and them is immense Their eyes ake to look up at you What shades does your full day of merit cast upon themCan you wonder then that they should embrace the first opportunity that offer'd to endeavour to bring you down to their level  Depend upon it my dear you will have more of it and more still as you bear it  As to this odious Solmes I wonder not at your aversion to him It is needless to say any thing to you who have so sincere an antipathy to him to strengthen your dislike Yet who can resist her own talents One of mine as I have heretofore said is to give an ugly likeness Shall I indulge itI will And the rather as in doing so you will have my opinion in justification of your aversion to him and in approbation of a steadiness that I ever admired and must for ever approve in your temper  I was twice in this wretch's company At one of the times your Lovelace was there I need not mention to you who have such a  pretty curiosity  tho' at present  only  a curiosity you know the unspeakable difference  Lovelace entertain'd the company in his lively gay way and made everybody laugh at one of his stories It was before this creature was thought of for you Solmes laugh'd too It was however  his  laugh For his first three years at least I imagine must have been one continual fit of crying and his muscles have  never yet been able to recover a risible tone His very smile you never saw him smile I believe never at least gave him cause to smile is so little natural to his features that it appears in him as hideous as the  grin  of a man in malice  I took great notice of him as I do of all the noble Lords of the creation in their peculiarities and was disgusted nay shock'd at him even then I was glad I remember on that particular occasion to see his strange features recovering their natural gloominess tho' they did this but slowly as if the muscles which contributed to his distortions had turn'd upon rusty springs  What a dreadful thing must even the Love of such a husband be For my part were I his wife But what have I done to myself to make but such a supposition I should never have comfort but in his absence or when I was quarreling with him A splenetic Lady who must have somebody to find fault with might indeed be brought to endure such a wretch The sight of him would always furnish out the occasion and all her servants for That reason and for  That  only would have cause to bless their master But how grievous and apprehensive a thing must it be for his wife had she the least degree of delicacy to catch herself in having done something to oblige him  So much for his person As to the other half of him he is said to be an insinuating creeping mortal to anybody he hopes to be a gainer by An insolent overbearing one where he has no such views And is not this the genuine spirit of meannessHe is reported to be spiteful and malicious even to the whole family of any single person who has once disobliged him and to his own relations most of all I am told that they are none of them such wretches as himself This may be one reason why he is for disinheriting them  My Kitty from one of his domestics tells me that his tenants hate him And that he never had a servant who spoke well of him Vilely suspicious of their wronging him probably from the badness of his own heart he is always changing  His pockets they say are continually cramm'd with keys So that when he would treat a guest a friend he has not out of your family he is half as long puzzling  which  is  which  as his niggardly treat might be concluded inAnd if it be wine he always fetches it himself Nor has he much trouble in doing so for he has very few visitorsonly those whom business or necessity brings For a gentleman who can help it would rather be benighted than put up at his house  Yet this is the man they have found out for the sake of considerations as sordid as those he is govern'd by for a husband that is to say for a Lord and Master for Miss Clarissa Harlowe  But perhaps he may not be quite so miserable as he is represented Characters extremely good or extremely bad are seldom justly given Favour for a person will exalt the one as disfavour will sink the other But your uncle Antony has told my mamma who objected to his covetousness that it was intended  to tie him  up as he called it  to your own terms  which would be with a hempen rather than a matrimonial cord I dare say But is not this a plain indication that even his own recommenders think him a mean creature and that he must be articled withperhaps for  necessaries  But enough and too much of such a mortal as thisYou must not have him my dearThat I am clear intho' not so clear how you will be able to avoid it except you assert the independence which your estate gives you  HERE my mamma broke in upon me She  wanted to see what I had written I was silly enough to read Solmes's character to her  She own'd that the man was not the most desirable of men had not the happiest appearance But what was person in a man And I was chidden for setting you against complying with your father's will Then follow'd a lecture upon the preference to be given in favour of a man who took care to discharge all his obligations to the world and to keep all together in opposition to a spendthrift or profligate A fruitful subject you know whether any particular person be meant by it or not Why will these wise parents by saying too much against the persons they dislike put one upon defending them Lovelace is not a spendthrift owes not obligations to the world tho' I doubt not profligate enough Then putting one upon doing  such  but common justice we must needs be prepossessed trulyAnd so we are put perhaps upon  curiosities  first how such a one or his friends may think of oneAnd then but too probably a distinguishing preference or something that looks like it comes in  My mamma charg'd me at last to write that side over againBut excuse me my good mamma I would not have the character lost upon any consideration since my vein ran freely into it And I never wrote to please myself but I pleased you A very good reason whyWe have but one mind between usOnly that sometimes you are a little too grave methinks I no doubt a little too flippant in your opinion  This difference in our tempers however is probably the reason that we love one another  so  well that in the words of Norris no  third love  can come in between Since each in the other's eye having something amiss and each loving the other well enough to bear being told of it and the rather perhaps as neither wishes to mend it This takes off a  good deal from that rivalry which might encourage a little if not a great deal of that latent spleen which in time might rise into envy and That into illwill So my dear if This be the case let each keep her fault and much good may do her with it say I For there is constitution in both to plead for it And what an hero or heroine must he or she be who can conquer a constitutional fault Let it be  avarice  as in some I  dare not  name Let it be  gravity  as in my  best friend  Or let it be  flippancy  as inI need not say whom  It is proper to acquaint you that I was obliged to comply with my mamma's  curiosity  My mamma has her share her  full  share of  curiosity  my dearand to let her see here and there some passages of your letters  I am broke in uponBut I will tell you byandby what passed between my mamma and me on this occasionAnd the rather as she had her GIRL her favourite HICKMAN and your LOVELACE all at once in her eye  Thus it was  'I cannot but think Nancy said she after all that there is a little hardship in Miss Harlowe's case And yet as her mamma says it is a grating thing to have a child who was always noted for her duty in  smaller  points to stand in opposition to her parents will in the  greater  yea in the  greatest of all  And now to middle the matter between both it is pity that the man they insist upon her accepting has not that sort of merit which so delicate a mind as Miss Harlowe's might reasonably expect in a husbandBut then this man is surely preferable to a libertine To a libertine too who has had a duel with her own brother  Fathers  and  mothers  must  think so were it  not  for that circumstanceAnd it is strange if  they  do not know best'  And so they must thought I from their experience if no little dirty views give  them  also that prepossession in one man's favour which they are so apt to censure their daughters for having in another'sAnd if as I may add in your case they have no creeping old musty uncle Antony's to strengthen their prepossessions as he does my mamma'sPoor creeping positive soul what has such an old bachelor as he to do to prate about the duties of children to parents unless he had a notion that parents owe some to their children But your mamma by her indolent meekness let me call it has spoiled all the three brothers  'But you see child proceeded my mamma what a different behaviour MINE is to YOU I recommend to you one of the soberest yet politest men in England'  I think little of my mamma's  politest  my dear She judges of honest Hickman for her  daughter  as she would have done I suppose twenty years ago for  herself  For Hickman appears to me to be a man of that antiquated cut as to his mind I mean A great deal too much upon the formal you must needs think him to be yourself  'Of a good family continued my mamma a fine clear and improving estate a prime consideration with my mamma as well as with some other folks whom you know And I  beg  and I  pray  you to encourage him At least not to use him the  worse  for his being so obsequious to you'  Yes indeed To use  him  kindly that he may treat  me  familiarlyBut distance to the menwretches is bestI say  'Yet all will hardly prevail upon you to do as I would have you What would you say were I to treat you as Miss Harlowe's father and mother treat her'  'What would I  say  MadamThat's easily answer'd I would SAY nothing Can you think such usage and to such a young lady is to be borne  'Come come Nancy be not so hasty You have heard but one side and that there is  more  to be said is plain by your reading to me but parts of her letters They are her parents  They  must know best Miss Harlowe as fine a child as she is must have  done  something must have  said  something you know how they lov'd her to make them use her thus'  'But if  she  should be blameless Madam how does your own supposition condemn  them  '  Then came up Solmes's great estate his good management of it'A little too NEAR indeed' was the word  O how moneylovers  thought I  will palliate  Yet my mamma is a princess in spirit to this Solmes  'What strange effects have prepossession and love upon young ladies'  I don't know how it is my dear but people take strange delight in finding out folks in love Curiosities  beget  curiosities I believe that's the thing  She proceeded to praise Mr Lovelace's person and his qualifications natural and acquired But then she would judge as  mothers  will judge and as  daughters  are very loth to judgeBut could say nothing in answer to your offer of living single and breaking with himififthree or four  If's  she made of one good one If  that  could be depended on she said  But still  obedience without reserve  reason what I will is the burden of my mamma's song And This for  my  sake as well as  yours    I must needs say that I think duty to parents is a very meritorious excellence But I bless God I have not your trials We can all be good when we have no temptation nor provocation to the contraryBut few young persons who can help themselves too would bear what you bear  I will not mention all that is upon my mind in relation to the behaviour of your father and uncles and the rest of them because I would not offend you But I have now a higher opinion of my own sagacity than ever I had in that I could never cordially love any one of your family but yourself I am not  born  to like them But it is my  duty  to be sincere to my  friend  And this will excuse her Anna Howe to Miss Clarissa Harlowe I ought indeed to have excepted your mamma a lady to be reverenced and now to be pity'd What must have been her treatment to be thus subjugated as I may call it Little did the good old Viscount think when he married his darling his only daughter to so wellappearing a gentleman and to her own liking too that she would have been so much kept down Another would call your father a tyrant if you will not All the world indeed would And if you love your mother you should not be very angry at the world for taking that liberty Yet after al  I cannot help thinking that she is the less to be pitied as she may be said be the gout or what will the occasion of his moroseness to have long behaved unworthy of her birth and fine qualities in yielding to incroaching spirits you may confine the reflection to your brother if it will pain you to extend it and This for the sake of preserving a temporary peace to herself which is the less worth attempting to preserve as it always produced a strength in the will of others and a weakness in her own that has subjected her to an arbitrariness which grew and became established upon her patienceAnd now to give up the most deserving of her children against her judgment a sacrifice to the ambition and selfishness of the least deservingBut I fly from this subjecthaving I fear said too much to be forgiven forand yet much less than is in my heart to say upon the overmeek subject  Mr Hickman is expected from London this evening I have desired him to inquire after Lovelace's  life and conversation in town If he has not I shall be very angry with him Don't expect a very good account of either He is certainly an intriguing wretch and full of inventions  Upon my word I most heartily despise that sex I wish they would let our fathers and mothers alone teazing  them  to teaze  us  with their golden promises and protestations and settlements and the rest of their ostentatious nonsense How charmingly might you and I live together and despise them allBut to be cajoled wiredrawn and insnared like silly birds into a state of bondage or vile subordination To be courted as princesses for a few weeks in order to be treated as slaves for the rest of our livesIndeed my dear as you say of Solmes I cannot endure themBut for your relations  friends  no more will I call them unworthy as they are even of the  other  name to take such a wretch's price as That and to the cutting off all reversions from his own familyHow must a mind but commonly just resist such a measure  Mr Hickman shall sound Lord M upon the subject you recommend But beforehand I can tell you what he and what his sisters will say when they  are  sounded Who would not be proud of such a relation as Miss Clarissa HarloweMrs Fortescue told me that they are all your very great admirers  If I have not been clear enough in my advice about what you shall do let me say that I can give it in one word It is only by reurging you to RESUME If you do all the rest will follow  We are told here that Mrs Norton as well as your aunt Hervey has given her opinion on the  implicit  side of the question If she can think that the part she has had in your education and your own admirable talents and acquirements are to be thrown away upon such a worthless creature as Solmes I could heartily quarrel with her You may think I say this to lessen your regard for the good woman And perhaps  not wholly without cause if you do For to own the truth methinks I don't love her so well as I should do did you love her so apparently less that I could be out of doubt that you love me better  Your mamma tells you  'That you will have great trials That you are under your papa's  discipline  '  The word's enough for me to despise them who give occasion for its use  'That it is out of her power to help you'  And again  'That if you have any favour to hope for it must be by the mediation of your uncles'  I suppose you will write to the oddities since you are forbid to see themBut can it be that such a lady such a sister such a wife such a mother has no influence in her own family Who indeed as you say would marry that can live single My choler is again beginning to rise RESUME my dearAnd that's all I will give myself time to say further lest I offend you when I cannot serve youOnly this that I am  Your truly affectionate friend and servant ANNA HOWE  LETTER XXVIII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Friday Mar  YOU will permit me my dear to touch upon a few passages in your last favour that affect me sensibly  In the first place you must allow me to say low as I am in spirits that I am very angry with you for your reflections on my relations particularly on my father and on the memory of my grandfather Nor my dear does your own mamma always escape the keen edge of your vivacity One cannot one's  self  forbear to write or speak freely of those we love and  honour that is to say when grief wrings the heart But it goes against one to hear any body else take the same liberties Then you have so very strong a manner of expression where you take a distaste that when passion has subsided and I come by reflection to see by  your  severity what I have given occasion for I cannot help condemning myself Let me then as matters arise make my complaints to you but be it your part to soothe and soften my angry passions by such advice as nobody better knows how to give And this the rather as you know what an influence your advice has upon me  I cannot help owning that I am pleased to have you join with me in opinion of the contempt which Mr Solmes deserves from me But yet permit me to say that he is not quite so horrible a creature as you make him As to his  person  I mean for with regard to his  mind  by all I have heard you have done him but justice But you have such a talent at an ugly likeness and such a vivacity that they sometimes carry you out of verisimilitude In short my dear I have known you in more instances than one sit down resolved to write all that wit rather than strict justice could suggest upon the given occasion Perhaps it may be thought that I should say the less on this particular subject because your dislike to him arises from love to me But should it not be our aim to judge of ourselves and of every thing that affects us as we may reasonably imagine other people would judge of us and of our actions  As to the advice you give to resume my estate I am determin'd not to litigate with my papa let what will be the consequence to myself I may give you at another time a more particular answer to your reasonings on this subject But at present will only observe that it is my opinion that Lovelace himself would hardly think me worth addressing were he to know  this  to be my resolution These  men    my dear with all their flatteries look forward to the PERMANENT Indeed it is fit they should For Love must be a very foolish thing to look back upon when it has brought persons born to affluence into indigence and laid a generous mind under the hard necessity of obligation and dependence  You very ingeniously account for the love we bear to one another from the  difference  in our tempers I own I should not have thought of That There may possibly be something in it But whether there be or not whenever I am cool and give myself time to reflect I will love you the better for the correction you give me be as severe as you will upon me Spare me not therefore my dear friend whenever you think me in the least faulty I love your agreeable raillery You know I always did Nor however  over  serious you think me did I ever think you  flippant  as you harshly call it One of the first conditions of our mutual friendship was that each should say or write to the other whatever was upon her mind without any offence to be taken A condition that is indeed an indispensable in all friendship  I knew your mamma would be for implicit obedience in a child I am sorry my case is so circumstanced that I  cannot  comply As my Mrs Norton says it would be my duty to do so if I could You are indeed very happy that you have nothing but your own agreeable yet whimsical humours to contend with in the choice she invites you to make of Mr HickmanHow happy should I be to be treated with so much lenity I should blush to have  my  mamma say that she  begg'd  and  pray'd  me and all in vain to encourage a man so unexceptionable as Mr Hickman  Indeed my beloved Miss Howe I am asham'd to have your mamma say with ME in her view  'What strange effects have Prepossession and Love upon young creatures of our sex'  This touches me the  more sensibly because you yourself my dear are so ready to  persuade  me into it I should be very blameable to endeavour to hide any the least byas upon my mind from you And I cannot but saythat this manthis Lovelaceis a person that might be liked well enough if he bore such a character as Mr Hickman bears and even if there were hopes of reclaiming him But LOVE methinks as short a word as it is has a  broad  sound with it Yet do I find that one may be driven by violent measures step by step as it were into something that may be calledI don't know what to call itA  conditional kind of liking  or soBut as to the word LOVEjustifiable and charming as it is in some cases that is to say in all the  relative  in all the  social  and what is still beyond both in all our  superior  duties in which it may be properly called  divine  it has methinks in this narrow circumscribed selfish peculiar sense no very pretty sound with it Treat me as freely as you will in all other respects I will love you as I have said the better for your friendly freedom But methinks I could be glad for SEXsake that you would not let this imputation pass so glibly from  your  pen or  your  lips as attributable to one of your own sex whether I be the person or not Since the  other  must have a  double  triumph when a person of your delicacy arm'd with such contempts of them all as you would have one think can give up a friend with an exultation over her weakness as a silly lovesick creature  I could make some other observations upon the contents of your last two letters but my mind is not free enough at present The occasions for the above stuck with me and I could not help taking the earliest notice of them  I will now acquaint you with all proceedings here But these shall be the subject of another Letter  LETTER XXIX Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Saturday March  I Have had such taunting messages and such repeated avowals of illoffices brought me from my brother and sister if I do not comply with their wills delivered too with provoking sauciness by Betty Barnes that I have thought it proper before I enter'd upon my intended address to my uncles in pursuance of the hint given me in my mamma's letter to expostulate a little with  them  But I have done it in such a manner as will give you if you please to take it as you have done some parts of my former letters great advantage over me In short you will have more cause than ever to declare me far gone in Love if my reasons for the change of my style in these letters with regard to Mr Lovelace do not engage your more favourable opinionFor I have thought proper to give them their own way and since they will have it that I have a preferable regard for Mr Lovelace I give them cause rather to confirm their opinion than doubt it  These are my reasons in brief for the alteration of my style  In the first place they have grounded their principal argument for my compliance with their will upon my acknowlegements that my heart is free and so supposing I give up no preferable person my opposition has the look of downright obstinacy in their eyes and they argue that at worst my aversion to Solmes is an aversion that may be easily surmounted and  ought  to be surmounted in duty to my father and for the promotion of family views  Next altho' they build upon this argument in order to silence me they seem not to believe me but  treat me as violently and as disgracefully as if I were in love with one of my father's footmenSo that my conditional willingness to give up Lovelace has procur'd me no favour  In the next place I cannot but think that my brother's antipathy to him is far from being wellgrounded His inordinate passion for the sex is his crime that is always rung in my ears and a very great one it is But does my brother recriminate upon him thus in love to meNoHis whole behaviour shews me that That is not his motive and that he thinks me rather in his way than otherwise  It is then the call of justice as I may say to speak up a little for a man who altho' provok'd by my brother did not do him all the mischief he could have done him and which my brother had endeavour'd to do  him  It might not be amiss therefore I thought to alarm them a little with an apprehension that the methods they are taking with me are the very reverse of those they should take to answer the end they design by them And after all what is the compliment I make Mr Lovelace if I  allow  it to be thought that I do really prefer him to such a man as him they terrify me with Then my Miss Howe concluded I accuses me of a tameness which subjects me to insults from my brother I will keep that dear friend in my eye and for  all  these considerations try what a little of  her  spirit will dosit it ever so aukwardly upon me  In this way of thinking I wrote to my brother and sister This is my Letter to him  TREATED as I am treated and in a great measure if not  wholly  by your instigations brother you must permit me to expostulate with you upon the occasion It is not my  intention  to displease you in what I am going to write And yet I must deal freely with you The occasion calls for it  And permit me in the first place to remind you That I am your  sister  and not your  servant  and that therefore the bitter revilings and passionate language brought me from you upon an occasion in which you have no reason to prescribe to me are neither worthy of my character to bear or of yours to offer  Put the case that I  were  to marry the man you dislike and that he were  not  to make a polite or tender husband Is that a reason for you to be an unpolite and disobliging brotherWhy must  you  Sir anticipate my misfortunes were such a case to happenLet me tell you plainly that the husband who could treat me as a  wife  worse than you of late have treated me as a  sister  must be a barbarous man indeed  Ask yourself I pray you Sir If you would thus have treated your sister Bella had she thought fit to receive the addresses of the man so much hated by youIf not let me caution you my brother not to take your measures by what you think  will be  borne but rather by what  ought  to be offer'd  How would  you  take it if you had a brother who in a like case were to act by  you  as you do by  me  You cannot but remember what a laconic answer you gave even to my papa who recommended to you Miss Nelly D'Oily  You did not like her  were your words And that was thought sufficient  You must needs think that I cannot but know to  whom  to attribute my disgraces when I recollect my papa's indulgence to me in permitting me to decline several offers and to  whom  that a common cause is endeavoured to be made in favour of a man whose person and manners are more exceptionable than those of any of the gentlemen I have been permitted to refuse  I offer not to compare the two men together Nor is there indeed the least comparison to be made between them All the difference to the one's disadvantage  if I did is but in one pointOf the greatest importance indeedBut to whom of  most  importanceTo  myself  surely were I to encourage his applicationOf the least to  you  Nevertheless if you do not by your strange policies unite  that man  and  me  as jointsufferers in one cause you shall find me as much resolv'd to renounce him as I am to refuse the other I have made an overture to this purpose I hope you will not give me reason to confirm my apprehensions that it will be owing to  you  if it be not accepted  It is a sad thing to have it to say without being conscious of ever having given you cause of offence that I have in  you  a  brother  but not a  friend    Perhaps you will not condescend to enter into the reasons of your late conduct with a foolish sister But if  politeness  if  civility  be not due to that character and to my sex  justice  is  Let me take the liberty further to observe that the principal end of a young gentleman's education at the university is to learn him to reason justly and to subdue the violence of his passions I hope brother that you will not give room for anybody who knows us both to conclude that the  oilette has learned the one more of the latter doctrine than the university has taught the other I am truly sorry to have cause to say that I have heard it often remarked that your uncontrouled passions are not a credit to your liberal education  I hope Sir that you will excuse the freedom I have taken with you You have given me too much reason for it and you have taken much greater with me  without  reasonso if you are offended ought to look at the cause and not at the effectThen examining yourself that cause will cease and there will not be anywhere a more accomplish'd gentleman than my brother  Sisterly affection I do assure you Sir unkindly  as you have used  me  and not the pertness which of late you have been so apt to impute to me is my motive in this hint Let me invoke your returning kindness my  only brother  And give me cause I beseech you to call you my  compassionating friend  For I am and ever will be  Your affectionate sister CL HARLOWE  This is my brother's answer  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    I Know there will be no end of your impertinent scribble if I don't write to you I write therefore But without entring into argument with such a conceited and pert preacher and questioner it is to forbid you to plague me with your quaint nonsense I know not what Wit in a woman is good for but to make her overvalue herself and despise everybody else Yours Miss Pert has set you above your duty and above being taught or prescrib'd to either by parents or anybody elseBut go on Miss your mortification will be the greater That's all child It  shall  I assure you if I can make it so so long as you prefer that villainous Lovelace who is justly hated by all your family We see by your Letter now as well as we too justly suspected before most evidently what hold he has got of your forward heart But the stronger the hold the greater must be the force and you shall have enough of that to tear such a miscreant from it In me notwithstanding your saucy lecturing and as saucy reflections before you are sure of a friend as well as a brother if it be not your own fault But if you will still think of such a husband as that Lovelace never expect either in  JA HARLOWE  I will now give you a copy of my letter to my sister with her unsisterly answer  IN what my dear sister have I offended you that instead of endeavouring to soften my father's anger against me as I am sure I should have done for you had my unhappy case been yours you should in so hardhearted a manner join to aggravate not only his displeasure but my mamma's against me Make but my case your own my dear Bella and suppose you were commanded to marry Mr Lovelace to whom you are believed to have an antipathy would you not think it a very grievous injunctionYet cannot your dislike to Mr  Lovelace  be greater than mine is to Mr  Solmes  Nor are Love and Hatred voluntary passions  My brother may perhaps think it a proof of a  manly  spirit to be an utter stranger to the gentle passions We have both heard him boast that he never loved with distinction and having predominating passions and checked in his first attempt perhaps he never will It is the less wonder then raw from the college so lately himself the  tutored  that he should set up for a tutor a prescriber to our gentler sex whose tastes and manners are differently formed For what according to his account are colleges but classes of tyrants from the upper students over the lower and from them to the tutorThat  he  with such  masculine  passions should endeavour to controul and bear down an unhappy sister in a case where his antipathy and give me leave to say his ambition once you would have allowed the latter to be his fault can be gratify'd by so doing may not be quite so much to be wonder'd atBut that a  sister  should give up the cause of a sister and join with him to set her father and mother against her in a case relative to sex in a case that might have been her ownIndeed my Bella this is not pretty in you  There was a time that Mr Lovelace was thought reclaimable and when it was far from being deem'd a censurable view to hope to bring back to the paths of virtue and honour a man of his sense and understanding I am far from wishing to make the experimentBut nevertheless will say That if I have  not  a regard for him the disgraceful methods taken to compel me to receive the addresses of such a man as Mr Solmes are enough to inspire it  Do you my sister for one moment lay aside all prejudice and compare the two men in their births their educations their persons their understandings their manners their air and their whole deportments and in their fortunes too taking in reversions And then judge of both Yet as I have frequently offer'd I will live single with all my heart if that will do  I cannot thus live in displeasure and disgraceI would if I could oblige all my friendsBut will it be  just  will it be  honest  to marry a man I cannot endureIf I have not been used to oppose the will of my father but have always delighted to oblige and obey judge of the strength of my antipathy by the painful opposition I am obliged to make and cannot help it  Pity then my dearest Bella my sister my friend my companion my adviser as you used to be when I was happy and  plead for    Your everaffectionate CL HARLOWE  To Miss  CLARY HARLOWE    LET it be pretty or not pretty in your wise opinion I shall speak my mind I'll assure you both of you and your conduct in relation to this detested Lovelace You are a fond foolish girl with all your wisdom Your letter shews  that  enough in  twenty places And as to your cant of living single nobody will believe you This is one of your fetches to avoid complying with your duty and the will of the most indulgent parents in the world as yours have been to you I am sureTho' now they see themselves finely requited for it  We all indeed once thought your temper soft and amiable But why was itYou never was contradicted before You had always your own way But no sooner do you meet with opposition in your wishes to throw yourself away upon a vile rake but you shew what you areYou cannot love Mr Solmes that's the pretence but sister sister let me tell you that is because Lovelace has got into your fond heart A wretch hated justly hated by us all and who has dipped his hands in the blood of your brotherYet  him  you would make our relation would you  I have no patience with you but for putting the case of my liking such a vile wretch as him As to the encouragement you pretend he received formerly from all our family it was before we knew him to be so vile And the proofs that had such force upon  us  ought to have had some upon  you  And  would  had you not been a foolish forward girl as on this occasion everybody sees you are  O how you run out in favour of the wretchHis birth his education his person his understanding his manners his air his fortuneReversions too taken in to augment the surfeiting catalogue What a fond string of lovesick praises is hereAnd yet you would live singleYes I warrantWhen so many imaginary perfections dance before your dazled eyeBut no moreI only desire that you will not while you seem to have such an opinion of your wit think every one else a fool and that you can at pleasure by your whining flourishes make us all dance after your lead  Write as often as you will this shall be the last answer or notice you shall have upon this subject from  ARABELLA HARLOWE  I had in readiness a letter for each of my uncles and meeting in the garden a servant of my uncle Harlowe I gave them to him to deliver according to their respective directions If I am to form a judgment by the answers I have received from my brother and sister as above I must not I doubt expect any good from them But when I have try'd every expedient I shall have the less to blame myself for if any thing unhappy should fall out I will send you copies of both when I shall see what notice they will be thought worthy of if of any  LETTER XXX Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Sunday night March  THIS man this Lovelace gives me great uneasiness He is extremely bold and rash He was this afternoon at our church In hopes to see me I suppose And yet if he had such hopes his usual intelligence must have failed him  Shorey was at church and a principal part of her observation was upon his haughty and proud behaviour when he turn'd round in the pew where he sat to our familypewMy papa and both my uncles were there so were my mamma and sister My brother happily was notThey all came home in disorder Nor did the congregation mind anybody but him it being his first appearance there since the unhappy rencounter  What did the man come for if he intended to look challenge and defiance as Shorey says he did and as others observed it seems as well as she Did he come for  my  sake and by behaving in such a manner  to those present of my family imagine he was doing me either service o  pleasureHe knows how they hate him Nor will he take pains would pains do to obviate their hatred  You and I my dear have often taken notice of his pride and you have rallied him upon it and instead of exculpating himself he has own'd it and by owning it has thought he has done enough  For my own part I thought pride in his case an improper subject for railleryPeople of birth and fortune to be proud is so needless so mean a viceIf they  deserve  respect they will have it without requiring it In other words for persons to endeavour to gain respect by a haughty behaviour is to give a proof that they mistrust their own merit To make confession that they  know  that their  actions  will not attract itDistinction or Quality may be prided in by those to whom distinction or quality is a  new  thing And then the reflection and contempt which such bring upon themselves by it is a counterbalance  Such added advantages too as this man has in his person and mien learned also as they say he is  Such  a man to be haughty to be imperiousThe lines of his own face at the same time condemning himHow wholly inexcusableProud of what Not of doing well The only  justifiable  prideProud of  exterior  advantagesMust not one be led by such a  stopshort  pride as one may call it in him or her who has it to mistrust the  interior  Some people may indeed be afraid that if they did not assume they would be trampled upon A very narrow fear however since they trample upon themselves who can fear  this  But this man must be secure that humility would be an ornament to him  He has talents indeed But those talents and his personal advantages have been snares to him It is plain they have And this shews that weigh'd in an equal balance he would be found greatly wanting  Had my friends confided as they did at first in that discretion which they do not accuse me of being defective in I dare say I should have found him out And then should have been as resolute to dismiss  him  as I was to dismiss others and as I  am  never to have Mr Solmes O that they did but know my heartIt shall sooner burst than voluntarily uncompelled undriven dictate a measure that shall cast a slur either upon them my sex or myself  Excuse me my dear friend for these grave  soliloquies  as I may call them How have I run from reflection to reflection But the occasion is recentThey are all in commotion below upon it  Shorey says that he watched my mamma's eye and bowed to her And she return'd the compliment He always admir'd my mamma She would not I believe have hated  him  had she not been  bid  to hate him and had it not been for the rencounter between him and her only son  Dr Lewin was at church and observing as everyone else did the disorder into which Mr Lovelace's appearance had put all our family was so good as to engage him in conversation when the service was over till they were all gone to their coaches  My father it seems is more and more incensed against me And so are my uncles They had my letters in the morning Their answers if they vouchsafe to answer me will demonstrate I doubt not the unseasonableness of this rash man's presence at our church  They are angry it seems at my mamma for returning his compliment What an enemy is hatred even to the common forms of civility which however more distinguish the  payer  of a compliment than the  receiver  But they all see they say that there is but one way to put an end to his insults So I shall suffer And in what will the rash man have benefited himself or mended his prospects  I am extremely apprehensive that this worse than ghostlike appearance of his bodes some still bolder step If he come hither and very desirous he is of my leave to come I am afraid there will be murder To avoid That if there were no other way I would most willingly be bury'd alive  They are all in consultation Upon my letters I suppose So they were in the morning which occasion'd my uncles to be at  our  church I will send you the copies of those letters as I promised in my last when I see whether I can give you their answers with them This letter is allIcannottellwhatthe effect of apprehension and displeasure at the man who has occasioned these apprehensions Six lines would have contained all that is in it to the purpose of my story  CL H  See Letter  xxxvi  for Mr Lovelace's account of his behaviour and intentions in his appearance at their church  LETTER XXXI Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq    Monday March  IN vain dost  These gentlemen affected the Roman style as they called it in their letters And it was an agreed rule with them to take in good part whatever freedoms they treated each other with if the passages were written in that style  thou and thy compeers press me to go to town while I am in such an uncertainty as I am at present with this proud Beauty All the ground I have hitherto gained with her is intirely owing to her concern for the safety of people whom I have reason to hate  Write then thou biddest me if I will not come That indeed I can do and as well without a subject  as with one And what follows shall be a proof of it  The Lady's malevolent brother has now as I told thee at M Hall introduced another man the most unpromising in his person and qualities the most formidable in his offers that has yet appeared  This man has by his proposals captivated every soul of the Harlowe's  Soul  did I sayThere is not a soul among them but my charmer's And she withstanding them All is actually confin'd and otherwise maltreated by a Father the most gloomy and positive at the instigation of a Brother the most arrogant and selfishBut thou knowest their characters and I will not therefore sully my paper with them  But is it not a confounded thing to be in love with one who is the daughter the sister the niece of a family I must eternally despise And the devil of it That Love increasing with herWhat shall I call it'Tis not scorn'Tis not pride'Tis not the insolence of an adored beautyBut 'tis to  virtue  it seems that my difficulties are owing And I pay for not being a sly sinner an hypocrite for being regardless of my reputation for permitting slander to open its mouth against me But is it necessary for such a one as I who have been used to carry all before me upon my own termsI who never inspir'd a Fear that had not a discerniblypredominant mixture of Love in it to be an hypocriteWell says the poet  He who seems virtuous does but act a part  And shews not his own nature but his art  Well but it seems I must  practise  for This art if I would succeed with this truly admirable creature But why  practise  for itCannot I  indeed  reformI have but  one  viceHave I JackThou knowest my heart if any man living does As far as I know it myself thou knowest itBut 'tis a cursed deceiverFor it has many and many a time imposed  upon its master  Master  did I say That am I not now Nor have I been from the moment I beheld this angel of a woman Prepared indeed as I was by her character before I saw her For what a mind must that be which tho' not virtuous itself admires not virtue in anotherMy visit to Arabella owing to a mistake of the sisters into which as thou hast heard me say I was led by the blundering uncle who was to introduce me but lately come from abroad to the  divinity  as I thought but instead of her carry'd me to a  mere mortal  And much difficulty had I so fond and so forward my Lady to get off without forfeiting All with a family that I intended should give me a goddess  I have boasted that I was once in love beforeAnd indeed I thought I was It was in my early manhoodwith that Qualityjilt whose infidelity I have vow'd to revenge upon as many of the sex as shall come into my power I believe in different climes I have already sacrificed an hecatomb to my Nemesis in pursuance of this vow But upon recollecting what I was  then  and comparing it with what I find in myself  now  I cannot say that I was ever in love before  What was it then dost thou ask me since the disappointment had such effects upon me when I found myself jilted that I was hardly kept in my sensesWhy I'll tell thee what as near as I can remember for it was a great while agoIt wasegad Jack I can hardly tell what it wasBut a vehement aspiration after a novelty I thinkThose confounded Poets with their celestiallyterrene descriptions did as much with me as the Lady They fired my imagination and set me upon a desire to become a goddessmaker I must needs try my newfledg'd pinions in sonnet elogy and madrigal I must have a Cynthia a Stella a Sacharissa as well as the best of them Darts and flames and the devil knows what must I  give to my Cupid I must create beauty and place it where nobody else could find it And many a time have I been at a loss for a subject when my newcreated goddess has been kinder than it was proper for my plaintive sonnet she should be  Then I had a vanity of  another  sort in my passion I found myself wellreceived among the women in general and I thought it a pretty  ladylike  tyranny I was very young then and very vain to single out some  one  of the sex to make  half a score  jealous And I can tell thee it had its effect For many an eye have I made to sparkle with rival indignation Many a cheek glow and even many a fan have I caused to be snapped at a sisterbeauty accompany'd with a reflection perhaps at being seen alone with a wild young fellow who could not be in private with both at once  In short Jack it was more Pride than Love as I now find it that put me upon making such a confounded rout about losing this noble var  etess I thought she loved me at least as well as I believed I loved her Nay I had the vanity to suppose she could not help it My friends were pleased with my choice They wanted me to be shackled For early did they doubt my morals as to the sex They saw that the dancing the singing the musical Ladies were all fond of my company For who I am in a humour to be vain I thinkfor who danc'd who sung who touch'd the string whatever the instrument with a better grace than thy friend  I have no notion of playing the hypocrite so egregiously as to pretend to be blind to qualifications which everyone sees and acknowleges Such praisebegging hypocrisy Such affectedlydisclaim'd attributes Such contemptible  raisetrapsBut yet shall my vanity extend only to  personals  such as the gracefulness of dress my debonnaire and my assureanceSelftaught selfacquired theseFor my  PARTS I value not myself upon  them  Thou wilt say I have no causePerhaps not But if I had any thing valuable as to intellectuals those are not my own And to be proud of what a man is answerable for the abuse of and has no merit in the right use of is to strut like the jay in a borrowed plumage  But to return to my fair jiltI could not bear that a woman who was the first that had bound me in silken fetters they were not iron ones like those I now wear should prefer a'coronet to me And when the bird was flown I set more value upon it than when I had it safe in my cage and could visit it when I would  But now am I in  deed  in love I can think of nothing of nobody else but the divine Clarissa Harlowe  Harlowe  How that hated word sticks in my throatBut I shall give her for it the name of Love  Lovelace    CLARISSA  O there's music in the name  That soft'ning me to infant tenderness  Makes my heart spring like the first leaps of life  But could'st thou have thought that I who think it possible for me to favour as much as I can be favoured that I who for this charming creature think of foregoing the  life of honour  for the  life of shackles  could adopt those overtender lines of Otway  I check myself and l  aving the three first lines of the following of Dryden's to the family of the whiners find the workings of the passion in my stormy soul better expressed by the three last  Love various minds does variously inspire  He stirs in gentle natures gentle fire  Like that of incense on the altar laid  But raging flames tempestuous souls invade  A fire which ev'ry windy passion blows  With pride it mounts and with revenge it glows  And with REVENGE it  shall  glowFor dost thou think that if it were not from the hope That this stupid family are all combin'd to do my work for me I would bear their insultsIs it possible to imagine that I would be brav'd as I am brav'd threaten'd as I am threaten'd by those who are afraid to see me and by this brutal brother too to whom I gave a life A life indeed not worth my taking had I not a greater pride in knowing that by means of his very Spy upon me I am playing him off as I please cooling or inflaming his violent passions as may best suit my purposes permitting so much to be reveal'd of my life and actions and intentions as may give him such a confidence in his doublefac'd agent as shall enable me to dance his employer upon my own wires  This it is that makes my pride mount above my resentment By this engine whose springs I am continually oiling I play them all off The busy old tarpaulin uncle I make but my embassador to Queen Annabella Howe to engage her for example sake to her Princessly daughter to join in their cause and to assert an authority they are resolv'd right or wrong or I could do nothing to maintain  And what my motive dost thou ask No less than this That my beloved shall find no protection out of my family for if I know  hers  fly she must or have the man she hates This therefore if I take my measures right and my Familiar fail me not will secure her mine in spight of them all in spight of her own inflexible heart Mine without condition without reformationpromises without the necessity of a siege of years perhaps and to be even then after wearing the guise of a meritdoubting hypocrisy at an uncertainty upon a probation unapproved ofThen shall I have all the rascals and rascalesses of the family come creeping to me I prescribing to  them and bringing that sordidlyimperious brother to kneel at the footstool of my throne  All my fear arises from the little hold I have in the heart of this charming frostpiece Such a constant glow upon her lovely features Eyes so sparkling Limbs so divinely turn'd Health so florid Youth so blooming Air so animated To have an heart so impenetrableAnd  I  the hitherto successful Lovelace the addressorHow can it beYet there are people and I have talk'd with some of them who remember that she was  born  Her nurse Norton boasts of her maternal offices in her earliest infancy and in her education  gradatim  So that there is full proof that she came not from above all at once an angel How then can she be so impenetrable  But here's her mistake nor will she be cured of itShe takes the man she calls her father her mother had been faultless had she not been her father's wife she takes the men she calls her uncles the fellow she calls her brother and the poor contemptible she calls her sister to  be  her father to  be  her uncles her brother her sister and that as such she owes to some of them reverence to others respect let them treat her ever so cruellySordid ties Mere cradleprejudicesFor had they not been imposed upon her by Nature when she was in a perverse humour or could she have chosen her relations Would any of these have been among them  How my heart rises at her preference of them to me when she is convinc'd of their injustice to me Convinc'd that the alliance would do honour to them allherself excepted to whom everyone owes honour and from whom the most princely family might receive it But how much more will my heart rise with indignation against her if I find she hesitates but one moment however persecuted about preferring me to the man she avowedly hates But she cannot surely be so mean as to purchase her peace  with them at so dear a rate She cannot give a sanction to projects form'd in malice and founded in a selfishness and that at her own expence which she has spirit enough to despise in others and ought to disavow that we may not think her a Harlowe  By this incoherent ramble thou wilt gather that I am not likely to come up in haste since I must endeavour first to obtain some assurance from the beloved of my soul that I shall not be sacrific'd to such a wretch as Solmes Woe be to the fairone if ever she be  driven  into my power for I despair of a voluntary impulse in my favour and I find a difficulty in obtaining this security  That her indifference to me is not owing to the superior liking she has for  any  other man is what rivets my chains But take care fairone take care O thou most exalted of female minds and loveliest of persons how thou debasest thyself by encourageing such a competition as thy sordid relations have set on foot in mere malice to meThou wilt say I rave And so I do  Perdition catch my soul but I do love her  Else  could I bear the perpetual revilings of her implacable family  Else  could I basely creep aboutnot her proud father's housebut his paddockand gardenwallsYet a quarter of a mile's distance between us not hoping to behold the least glimpse of her shadow  Else  should I think myself repaid amply repaid if the fourth fifth or sixth midnight stroll thro' unfrequented paths and over briery inclosures afford me a few cold lines the even  expected  purport only to let me know that she values the most worthless person of her very worthless family more than she values me and that she would not write at all but to induce me to bear insults which un  man  me to bearMy lodging in the intermediate way at a wretched alehouse disguised like an inmate of it Accommodations equally vile as those  I met with in my Westphalian journey 'Tis well that the necessity for all This arises not from scorn and tyranny but is first imposed upon herself  But was ever hero in romance opposing giants and dragons excepted called upon to harder trialsFortune and family and reversionary grandeur on my side Such a wretched fellow my competitorMust I not be deplorably in love that can go thro' these difficulties encounter these contempts By my soul I am halfasham'd of myself I who am perjur'd too by priority of obligation if I am faithful to any woman in the world  And yet why say I I am half asham'dIs it not a glory to love  her  whom everyone who sees her either loves or reveres or both Dryden says  The cause of Love can never be assign'd  'Tis in no faceBut in the lover's mind  And Cowley thus addresses Beauty as a mere imaginary  Beauty thou wild fantastic ape  Who dost in ev'ry country change thy shape  Here black there brown here tawny and there white  Thou flatterer who comply'st with every sight  Who hast no certain What nor Where  But both these had they been her cotemporaries and known her would have confess'd themselves mistaken And taking together person mind and behaviour would have acknowleg'd the  justice  of the universal voice in her favour  Full many a Lady  I've ey'd with best regard and many a time  Th' harmony of their tongues hath into bondage  Brought my too diligent ear For  several  virtues  Have I lik'd  several  women Never any  With so full soul but some defect in her  Did quarrel with the noblest grace she ow'd  And put it to the  foil  But  SHE  O  SHE  So perfect and so peerless is created  Of ev'ry creature's best  Thou art curious to know If I have not started a new gameIf it be possible for so universal a lover to be confined so long to one object Thou knowest nothing of this charming creature that thou canst put such questions to me or thinkest thou know'st me better than thou dost All that's excellent in her sex is this LadyUntil by  matrimonial  or  equal  intimacies I have found her less than angel it is impossible to think of any other Then there are so many stimulatives to such a spirit as mine in this affair besides Love Such a field for stratagem and contrivance which thou knowest to be the delight of my heart Then the rewarding end of allTo carry off such a girl as This in spight of all her watchful and implacable friends and in spight of a prudence and reserve that I never met with in any of the sexWhat a triumphWhat a triumph over the whole sex And then such a Revenge to gratify which is only at present politically rein'din eventually to break forth with the greater furyIs it possible think'st thou that there can be room for a thought that is not  of  her and devoted  to  her  BY the advices I have this moment received I have reason to think that I shall have occasion for thee here Hold thyself in readiness to come down upon the first summons  Let Belton and Mowbray and Tourville likewise prepare themselves I have a great mind to contrive a method to send James Harlowe to travel for improvement Never was there Booby'Squire that more wanted it  Contrive  it did I say I have  already  contriv'd it could I but put it in execution without being suspected to have a hand in it This I am resolved upon If I have not his  sister  I will have  him    But be This as it may there is a present likelihood of room for glorious mischief A confederacy had been for  some time  form'd against me but the uncles and the nephew are  now  to be  double  servanted  single  servanted they were before and those servants are to be  double  arm'd when they attend their masters abroad This indicates their resolute enmity to me and as resolute favour to Solmes  The reinforced orders for this hostile apparatus are owing it seems to a visit I made yesterday to their church a good place to begin a reconciliation in were the heads of the family christians and did they mean any thing by their prayers My hopes were to have an invitation or at least to gain a pretence to accompany home the gloomy sire and so get an opportunity to see my goddess For I believed they durst not but be  civil  to me at least But they were filled with terror it seems at my entrance a terror they could not get over I saw it indeed in their countenances and that they all expected something extraordinary to followAnd so it  should  have done had I been more sure than I am of their daughter's favour Yet not a hair of any of their stupid heads do I intend to hurt  You shall all have your directions in writing if there be occasion But after all I dare say there will be no need but to shew your faces in my company  Such faces never could four men shewMowbray's so fierce and so fighting Belton's so pert and so pimply Tourville's so fair and so foppish Thine so rough and so resolute And  I  your leaderWhat hearts altho' meditating hostility must those be which we shall not appallEach man occasionally attended by a servant or two long ago chosen for qualities resembling his master's  Thus Jack as thou desirest have I written Written upon Something upon Nothing upon Revenge which I love upon Love which I hate  heartily  hate because 'tis my master And upon the devil knows what besidesFor looking back I'm amaz'd at the length of it  Thou  may'st read it  I  would not for a King's ransomBut so as I do  but  write thou say'st thou wilt be pleased  Be pleased then I  command  thee to be pleased If not for the writer's or written's sake for thy word's sake And so in the royal style for am I not likely to be thy King and thy Emperor in the great affair before us I bid Thee very heartily  Farewell  LETTER XXXII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Tuesday March  I Now send you copies of my letters to my uncles With their answers Be pleased to return the latter by the first deposite I leave them for  you  to make remarks upon  I  shall make none  To  JOHN HARLOWE  Esq  Sat March  ALLOW me my honoured Second Papa as in my happy days you taught me to call you to implore your interest with my papa to engage him to dispense with a command which if insisted upon will deprive me of my freewill and make me miserable for my whole life  For my  whole life  let me repeat Is that a small point my dear uncle to give up Am not  I  to live with the man Is anybody else Shall I not therefore be allow'd to judge for myself whether I  can  or can  not  live  happily  with him  Should it be ever so  un  happily will it be prudence to complain or appeal If it were to whom could I appeal with effect against a husband And would  not the invincible and avow'd dislike I have for him at  setting out  justify as it might seem any ill usage from him  in that state  were I to be ever so observant of him And if I were to be  at all so  it must be from Fear not Love  Once more let me repeat That this is not a  small  point to give up And that it is  for life  Why I pray you good Sir should I be made miserable for  life  Why should I be deprived of all comfort but that which the hope that it would be a very short one would afford me  Marriage is a very solemn engagement enough to make a young creature's heart ake with the  best  prospects when she thinks seriously of itTo be given up to a strange man To be ingrafted into a strange family To give up her very name as a mark of her becoming his absolute and dependent property To be obliged to prefer this strange man to father motherto every bodyAnd his humours to all her ownOr to contend perhaps in breach of a vow'd duty for every innocent instance of freewill To go no whither To make acquaintance To give up acquaintanceTo renounce even the strictest friendships perhaps all at his pleasure whether she think it reasonable to do so or notSurely Sir a young creature ought not to be obliged to make all these sacrifices but for such a man as she can approveIf she  is  how sad must be the caseHow miserable the life if to be called  life  I wish I could obey you all What a pleasure would it be to me if I could  Marry first and Love will come after  was said by one of my dearest friends But 'tis a shocking assertion A thousand things may happen to make that state but barely tolerable where it is entered into with mutual affection What must it then be where the husband can have no confidence in the love of his wife but has reason rather  to question it from the preference he  himself  believes she would have given to somebody else had she been at her own option What doubt what jealousies what want of tenderness what unfavourable prepossessions will there be in a matrimony thus circumstanced How will every look every action even the most innocent be liable to misconstructionWhile on the other hand an indifference a carelessness to oblige may take place and Fear  only  can constrain even an  appearance  of what ought to be the real effect of undisguised Love  Think seriously of these things dear good Sir and represent them to my papa in that strong light which the subject will bear but in which my sex and my tender years and inexperience will not permit me to paint it and use your powerful interest that your poor niece may not be consigned to a misery so durable  I have offer'd to engage not to marry at all if that condition may be accepted What a disgrace is it to me to be thus sequester'd from company thus banish'd my papa's and mamma's presence thus slighted and deserted by you Sir and my other kind uncle And to be hinder'd from attending at that public worship which were I  out  of the way of my duty would be most likely to reduce me into the right path againIs this the way Sir can it be thought to be taken with a free and open spiritMay not this strange method rather harden than convinceI cannot bear to live in disgrace thus The very servants so lately permitted to be under my own direction hardly daring to speak to me my own servant discarded with high marks of undeserved suspicion and displeasure and my sister's maid set over me  The matter may be too far pu  h'd Indeed it may And then perhaps every one will be sorry for their parts in it  May I be suffered to mention an expedientIf  I  am  to be watch'd banish'd and confin'd Suppose Sir it were to be at your houseThen the neighbouring gentry will the less wonder that the person of whom they used to think so favourably appeared not at church here and that she received not their visits  I hope there can be no objection to This You used to love to have me with you Sir when all went  happily  with me And will you not now permit me in my  troubles  the favour of your house till all this displeasure be overblownUpon my word Sir I will not stir out of doors if you require the contrary of me Nor will I see any body but whom you'll allow me to see provided you will not bring Mr Solmes to persecute me there  Procure then this favour for me if you cannot procure the still greater that of a happy reconciliation which nevertheless I presume to hope for if  you  will be so good as to plead for me And you will then add to those favours and to that indulgence which have bound me and then will for ever bind me to be  Your dutiful and obliged Niece CL HARLOWE  The  ANSWER    Sunday night  My dear Niece  IT grieves me to be forced to deny you any thing you ask Yet it  must  be so for unless you can bring your mind to oblige us in this one point in which our promises and honour were engaged before we believed there could be so sturdy an opposition you must never expect to be what you have been to us all  In short niece we are an  embattel'd phalanx  your reading makes you a stranger to nothing but what you should be most acquainted withSo you will see  by that expression that we are not to be pierced by your persuasions and invincible persistence We have agreed  all  to be moved or  none  and not to comply without one another So you know your destiny and have nothing to do but to yield to it  Let me tell you the virtue of obedience lies not in obliging when you can be obliged againBut give up an inclination and there is some merit in That  As to your expedient You shall not come to my house Miss Clary tho' this is a prayer I little thought I ever should have deny'd you For were you to keep your word as to  seeing  nobody but whom we please yet can you  write  to somebody else and receive letters from him This we too well know you can and have doneMore is the shame and the pity  You  offer to live single Miss  We  wish you marry'd But because you mayn't have the man your heart is set upon why truly you'll have nobody we shall recommend And as we know that some how or other you correspond with him or at least did as long as you could and as he defies us all and would not dare to do it if he were not sure of you in spite of us all which is not a little vexatious to us you must think we are resolv'd to frustrate him and triumph over him rather than he over us That's one word for all So expect not any advocateship from me I will not plead for you and that's enough From  Your displeased Uncle JOHN HARLOWE  P S  For the rest I refer to my brother Antony  To  ANTONY HARLOWE  Esq    Saturday March  Honoured Sir  AS you have thought fit to favour Mr Solmes with your particular recommendation and was very  earnest in his behalf ranking him as you told me upon introducing him to me amongst your select friends and expecting my regards to him accordingly I beg your patience while I offer a few things out of many that I could offer to your serious consideration on occasion of his address to me if I am to use that word  I am charged with prepossession in another person's favour You will be pleased Sir to consider that till my brother returned from Scotland that other person was not discouraged nor was I forbid to receive his visits And is it such a crime in me if I  should  prefer an acquaintance of Twelve months to one of TwoI believe it will not be pretended that in birth education or personal endowments a comparison can be made between the two And only let me ask you Sir if the one would have been thought of for me had he not made such offers as upon my word I think  I  ought not in justice to accept nor  he  to propose Offers which if  he  had not made I dare say my  papa  would not have required them of him  But the one it seems has many faultsIs the other fault  less  The principal thing objected to Mr Lovelace and a very inexcusable one is that he is immoral in his LovesIs not the other in his HatredsNay as I may say in his Loves too the object only differing if  the love of money  be  the root of all evil  But Sir if I am prepossessed what has Mr Solmes to hope forWhy should he persevere What must I think of the man who would wish me to be  his  against my inclinationAnd is it not a very harsh thing for my friends to desire to see me marry'd to one I  cannot  love when they will not be persuaded but that there is one I  do  love  Treated as I am now is the time for me to speak out or neverLet me review what it is Mr Solmes depends upon on this occasion Does he believe that the disgrace which I suffer on his account will give  him a merit with me Does he think to win my esteem thro' my uncles sternness to me by my brother's contemptuous usage by my sister's unkindness by being deny'd to visit or be visited and to correspond with my chosen friend altho' a person of unexceptionable honour and prudence and of my own sex my servant to be torn from me and another servant set over me to be confined like a prisoner to narrow and disgraceful limits in order avowedly to mortify me and to break my spirit to be turn'd out of that familymanagement which I loved and had the greater pleasure in it because it was an ease as I thought to my mamma and what my sister chose not and yet tho' time hangs heavy upon my hands to be so put out of my course that I have as little inclination as liberty to pursue any of the choice delights of my lifeAre these steps necessary to reduce me to a standard so low as to make me a fit wife for this manYet these are all he can have to trust toAnd if his reliance is on these measures I would have him to know that he mistakes  meekness  and  gentleness  of disposition for  servility  and  baseness  of heart  I beseech you Sir to let the natural turn and bent of  his  mind and  my  mind be considered What are his qualities by which he would hope to win my esteemDear dear Sir if I  am  to be compelled let it be in favour of a man that can read and writeThat can  teach  me something For what a husband must that man make who can do nothing but command and needs himself the instruction he should be qualified to give  I may be conceited Sir I may be vain of my little reading of my writing as of late I have more than once been told I amBut Sir the more unequal the proposed match if so The better opinion I have of myself the worse I must have of him and the more unfit are we for each other  Indeed Sir I must say I thought my friends had  put a higher value upon me My brother pretended once that it was owing to such value that Mr Lovelace's address was prohibitedCan this be and such a man as Mr Solmes be intended for me  As to his proposed settlements I hope I shall not incur your greater displeasure if I say what all who know me have reason to think and some have upbraided me for that I despise those motives Dear dear Sir what are settlements to one who has as much of her own as she wishes forWho has more in her own power as a single person than it is probable she would be permitted to have at her disposal as a wifeWhose expences and ambition are moderate and if she had superfluities would rather dispense them to the necessitous than lay them by her useless If then such narrow motives have so little weight with me for my  own  benefit shall the remote and uncertain view of familyaggrandizement and that in the person of my  brother  and his  descendants  be thought sufficient to influence me  Has the behaviour of that brother to me of late or his consideration for the family which had so little weight with him that he could choose to hazard a life so justly precious as an only son's rather than not gratify passions which he is above attempting to subdue and give me leave to say has been too much indulged in either for his own good or the peace of anybody related to him Has his behaviour I say deserved of  me  in particular that I should make a sacrifice of my temporal and who knows of my eternal happiness to promote a plan that if I might be permitted to examine it I will venture to engage to demonstrate it to be if not absurd very precarious and what must depend upon improbable contingencies  I am afraid you will condemn my warmth But does not the occasion require it To the want of a greater degree of earnestness in my opposition it seems it is owing that such advances have been made as  have been made Then dear Sir allow something I beseech you for a spirit raised and imbittered by disgraces which knowing my own heart I am confident to say are unmerited  But why have I said so much in answer to the supposed charge of prepossession when I have declared to my mamma as now Sir I do to you that if it be not insisted upon that I shall marry any other person particularly this Mr Solmes I will enter into any engagements never to have the other nor any man else without their consents that is to say without the consents of my Father and Mother and of you my Uncle and my eldest Uncle and my cousin Morden as he is one of the trustees for my grandfather's bounty to meAs to my Brother indeed I cannot say that his treatment of me has been of late so brotherly as to intitle him to more than civility from me And for  this  give me leave to add he would be very much my debtor  If I have not been explicit enough in declaring my dislike to Mr Solmes that the charge of  prepossession  may not be supposed to influence me against him I do declare solemnly That were there no such man as Mr Lovelace in the world I would not have  him  It is necessary in some  one  of my letters to my dear friends that I should write so clearly as to put this out of all doubt And to whom can I better address myself with an explicitness that can admit of no mistake than to a gentleman who professes the highest regard for plaindealing and sincerity  Let me then for these reasons be still more particular in some of my exceptions to him  Mr Solmes appears to me to all the world indeed to have a very narrow mind and no great capacity He is coarse and indelicate as rough in his manners as in his person He is not only narrow but covetous Being possessed of great wealth he enjoys it not nor has the spirit to communicate to a distress of any  kind Does not his own sister live unhappily for want of a little of his superfluities And suffers he not his aged uncle the brother of his own mother to owe to the generosity of strangers the poor subsistence he picks up from halfadozen familiesYou know Sir my open free communicative temper How unhappy must I be circumscribed in his narrow selfish circle out of which being withheld by this diabolical parsimony he dare no more stir than a conjurer out of his nor would let me  Such a man as this  love  Yes perhaps he may my grandfather's estate which he has told several persons and could not resist hinting it to me with that sort of pleasure which a low mind takes when it intimates its own interest as a sufficient motive for it to expect another's favour lies so extremely convenient for him that it would double the value of a considerable part of his own That estate and an alliance which would do credit to his obscurity and narrowness may make him think he  can  love and induce him to believe he  does  But at most it is but a secondplace Love Riches were are and always will be his predominant passion  His  were left him by a miser on this very account And I must be obliged to forego all the choice delights of my life and be as mean as he or else be quite unhappy Pardon Sir this severity of expressionOne is apt to say more than one would of a person one dislikes when more is said in his favour than he can possibly deserve and when he is urged to my acceptance with so much vehemence that there is no choice left me  Whether these things be perfectly so or not while I  think  they are it is impossible I should ever look upon him in the light he is offered to me Nay were he to be proved ten times better than I have represented him and sincerely think him yet would he be still ten times more disagreeable to me than  any other man I know in the world Let me therefore beseech you Sir to become an advocate for your niece that she may not be made a victim of to a man so highly disgustful to her  You and my other uncle can do a great deal for me if you please with my papa Be persuaded Sir that it is not obstinacy I am governed by It is aversion an aversion I cannot overcome For if I have but  endeavoured  to reason with myself out of regard to the duty I owe to my papa's will my heart has recoiled and I have been averse to myself for offering but to argue with myself in behalf of a man who in the light he appears to me has no one merit and who knowing this aversion could not persevere as he does if he had the spirit of a man and a gentleman  If Sir you can think the contents of this letter reasonable I beseech you to support them with your interest If notI shall be most unhappyNevertheless it is but just in me so to write as that Mr Solmes may know what he has to trust to  Forgive dear Sir this tedious letter and suffer it to have weight with you and you will for ever oblige  Your dutiful and affectionate Niece CL HARLOWE  Mr  ANTONY HARLOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Niece CLARY  YOU had better not write to us or to any of us To me particularly you had better never to have set pen to paper on the subject whereupon you have written  He that is first in his own cause  saith the wise man  seemeth just But his neighbour cometh and searcheth him  And so in this respect will I be your  neighbour  for I will search your heart to the bottom that is to say if your letter be written from  your heart Yet do I know what a task I have undertaken because of the knack you are noted for at writing But in defence of a father's authority in behalf of the good and honour and prosperity of a family one comes of what a hard thing would it be if one could not beat down all the arguments a rebel child how loth I am to write down that word of Miss Clary Harlowe can bring in behalf of her obstinacy  In the first place don't you declare and that contrary to your declarations to your mother that you prefer the man we all hate and who hates us as badThen what a character have you given of a worthy gentleman I wonder you dare write so freely of a man we all respect But possibly it may be for that very reason  How you begin your letterBecause I value Mr Solmes as my friend you treat him the worseThat's the plain Dunstable of the matter MissI am not such a fool but I can see ThatAnd so a noted whoremonger is to be chosen before a man who is a moneylover Let me tell you niece this little becomes so nice a one as you have been always reckon'd Who think you does most injustice a prodigal man or a saving manThe one saves his own money the other spends other people's But your favourite is a sinner in grain and upon record  The devil's in your sex God forgive me for saying soThe nicest of them will prefer a vile rake and WhI suppose I must not repeat the wordThe  Word  will offend when the  Vicious  denominated by that word will be chosenI had not been a bachelor to this time if I had not seen such a mass of contradictions in you allSuch  gnatstrainers  and  camelswallowers  as venerable Holy Writ has it What names will perverseness call things byA prudent man who intends to be just to everybody is a covetous manWhile a vile prossigate rake is christen'd  with the appellation of a gallant man and a polite man I'll warrant you  It is my firm opinion Lovelace would not have so much regard for you as he professes but for two reasons And what are theseWhy out of spite to all of usone of them The other because of your independent fortune I wish your good grandfather had not left what he did so much in your own power as I may say But little did he imagine his beloved granddaughter would have turned upon all her friends as she has done  What has Mr Solmes to hope for if you are prepossess'd  Heyday Is this  you  cousin ClaryHas he then nothing to hope for from your father's and mother's and our recommendationsNo nothing at all it seemsO braveI should think that  this  with a dutiful child as we took you to be was  enough  Depending on this your duty we proceeded And now there is no help for it For we won't be balked Neither shall our friend Mr Solmes I can tell you that  If your estate is convenient for him what then Does that pert cousin make it out that he does not love you He had need to expect some good  with  you that has so little good to hope for  from  you mind that But pray is not this estate  our  estate as we may say Have we not  all  an interest in it and a prior right if right were to have taken place And was it more than a good old man's dotage God rest his soul that gave it you before us allWell then ought we not to have a choice who shall have it in marriage with you And would you have the conscience to wish us to let a vile fellow who hates us all run away with itYou bid me weigh what you write Do you weigh this girl And it will appear we have more to say for ourselves than you were aware of  As to your hard treatment as you call it thank  yourself for That It may be over when you will So I reckon nothing upon that You was not banish'd and confin'd till all intreaty and fair speeches were try'd with you Mind that And Mr Solmes can't help your obstinacyLet that be observ'd too  As to being visited and visiting you never was fond of either So that's a grievance put into the scale to make weightAs to disgrace that's as bad to us as to you So fine a young creatureSo much as we used to brag of youAnd too besides this is all in your power as the restBut your heart recoils when you would persuade yourself to obey your parentsFinely describ'd i'n't itToo truly described I own as you go on I know that you may love him if you willI had a good mind to bid you hate him then perhaps you'd like him the better For I have always found a most horrid romantic perverseness in your sex To  do  and to  love  what you should not is meat drink and vesture to you all  I am absolutely of your brother's mind That reading and writing tho' not too much for the wits of you young girls are too much for your judgmentsYou say you  may be  conceited cousin you  may be  vainAnd so you  are  to despise this gentleman as you do He can read and write as well as  most  gentlemen I can tell you  that  Who told you Mr Solmes can't read and write But you must have a husband who can learn you somethingI wish you knew but your  duty  as well as you do your talentsThat niece you have of late to learn and Mr Solmes will therefore find something to instruct you in I won't shew him this letter of yours tho' you seem to desire it lest it should provoke him to be too severe a schoolmaster when you are his'n  But now I think of it suppose you  are  readier at your pen than heYou will make the more useful wife to him won't you For who so good an oeconomist as youAnd you may keep all his accompts and save yourselves a stewardAnd let me tell you  this is a fine advantage in a family For those stewards are often sad dogs and creep into a man's estate before he knows where he is and not seldom is he forced to pay them interest for his own money I know not why a good wife should be above these things'Tis better than lying abed half the day and junketing and cardplaying all the night and makeing yourselves wholly useless to every good purpose in your own families as is now the fashion among yeThe duce take ye all that do so say IOnly that thank my stars I am a bachelorThen this is a province you are admirably vers'd in You grieve that it is taken from you  here  you know So here Miss with Mr Solmes you will have something to keep account of for the sake of you and your children With t'other perhaps you'll have an account to keep tooBut an account of what will go over the left shoulder only of what he squanders what he borrows and what he owes and never will pay Come come cousin you know nothing of the world a man's a man and you may have many partners in a handsome man and costly ones too who may lavish away all you save Mr Solmes therefore for my money and I hope for yours  But Mr Solmes is a coarse man he is not delicate enough for your niceness because I suppose he dresses not like a fop and a coxcomb and because he lays not himself out in complimental nonsense the poison of female minds He is a man of sense I can tell you No man tal  s more to the purpose to  us  But you sly him so that he has no opportunity given him to express it to  you  And a man who loves if he have ever so much sense looks like a fool especially when he is despised and treated as you treated him the last time he was in your company  As to his sister she threw herself away as you want to do against his full warning For he told her what she had to trust to if she married where she did  marry And he was as good as his word and so an honest man ought Offences against warning ought to be smarted for Take care This be not your case Mind that  His uncle deserves no favour from  him  for he would have circumvented him and got Sir Oliver to leave to himself the estate he had always designed for him his nephew and brought him up in the hope of it  Too ready forgiveness does but encourage offences  That's your good father's maxim And there would not be so many headstrong daughters as there are if this maxim were kept in mindPunishments are of service to offenders Rewards should be only to the meriting And I think the former are to be dealt out rigorously in wilful cases  As to his  love  he shews it but too much for your deservings as they have been of late let me tell you That And This is  his  misfortune and may in time perhaps be  yours    As to his parsimony which you wickedly call diabolicala very free word in your mouth let me tell yeLittle reason have  you  of all people for this on whom he proposes of his own accord to settle all he has in the world A proof let him love  riches  as he will that he loves  you  better But that you may be without excuse on this score we will tie him up to your own terms and oblige him by the marriage articles to allow you a very handsome quarterly sum to do what you please with And this has been told you before and I have said it to Mrs Howe that good and worthy lady before her proud daughter that you might hear of it again  To contradict the charge of prepossession to Lovelace you offer never to have him without our consents And what is This saying but that you will hope on for our consents and to wheedle and tire us out Then he will always be in expectation while you are single And we are to live on at this rate  are we vexed by you and continually watchful about you and as continually exposed to his insolence and threats Remember last Sunday girlWhat  might  have happen'd had your brother and he metMoreover you can't do with such a spirit as his as you can with worthy Mr Solmes The one you make tremble the other will make you quake Mind that And you will not be able to help yourself And remember that if there should be any misunderstanding between  one  of them and you we should all interpose and with effect no doubt But with the  other  it would be  selfdo selfhave  and who would either care or dare to put in a word for you Nor let the supposition of matrimonial differences frighten you Honeymoon lasts not nowadays above a fortnight and Dunmow flitch as I have been informed was  never  claimed tho' some say  once  it was Marriage is a queer state child whether pair'd by the parties or by their friends Out of three brothers of us you know there was but one had courage to marry And why was it do you think We were wise by other people's experience  Don't despise money so much you may come to know the value of it That is a piece of  instruction  that you  are to learn  and which according to your  own  notions Mr Solmes will be  able to teach you    I do indeed  condemn your warmth  I won't  allow for disgraces you bring upon yourself  If I thought them  unmerited  I would be your advocate But it was always my notion that children should not dispute their parents authority When your grandfather left his estate to you tho' his three sons and a grandson and your elder sister were in being we all acquiesced And why Because it was our father's doing Do you imitate that example If you will not those who set it you have the more reason to hold you inexcusable Mind that Cousin  You mention your brother too scornfully And in  your letter to him are very disrespectful as well as in your sister's to her He is your brother a third older than yourself And a  man  And while you can pay so much regard to one man of  a twelve month's acquaintance only  pray be so good as not to forget what is due to a brother who next to us three brothers is the head of the family and on whom the name depends As upon your dutiful compliance depends the success of the noblest plan that ever was laid down for the honour of the family you are come of And pray now let me ask you If the honour of That will not be an honour to youIf you don't think so the more unworthy you You shall see the plan if you promise not to be prejudiced against it right or wrong If you are not besotted to that man I am sure you will like it If you are were Mr Solmes an angel it would signify nothing For the devil is Love and Love is the devil when it gets into any of your heads Many examples have I seen of that  If there were no such man as Lovelace in the world you would not have Mr Solmes  You  would not  MissVery pretty trulyWe  see  how your spirit is  imbitter'd  indeedWonder not since it is come to your  will nots  that those who have authority over you say  You shall have the other  And I am one Mind that And if it behoves You  to speak out  Miss it behoves US not to  speak in  What's  sauce for the goofe is sauce for the gander  Take that in your thought too  I humbly apprehend that Mr Solmes  has the spirit of a man and a gentleman  I would admonish you therefore not to provoke it He pities you as much as he loves you He says He will convince you of his love by deeds since he is not permitted by you to express it by words And all his dependance is upon your generosity hereafter We hope he  may  depend upon That We encourage him to think he  may And this heartens him up So that you may lay his constancy at your parents and your uncles doors and This will be another mark of your duty you know  You must be sensible that you reflect upon your parents and all of us when you tell me you cannot in  justice  accept of the settlements proposed to you This reflection we should have wonder'd at from you once but now we don't  There are many other very censurable passages in this free letter of yours but we must place them to the account of your  imbittered  spirit I am glad you mention'd that word because we should have been at a loss what to have call'd itMuch rather have had reason to give it a better name  I love you dearly still Miss I think you tho' my niece one of the finest young gentlewomen I ever saw But upon my conscience I think you ought to obey your parents and oblige me and my brother John For you know very well that we have nothing but your good at heart consistently indeed with the good and honour of  all  of us What must we think of any one of it who would not promote the good of the whole and who would set one part of it against anotherWhich God forbid say IYou see I am for the good of  all  What shall  I  get by it let things go as they will Do I want any thing of any body for my own sake Does my brother JohnWell then cousin Clary What would you be at as I may say  O but You can't love Mr SolmesBut I say you know not  what  you can do You  encourage  yourself in your dislike You  permit  your heart little did I think it was such a froward one to  recoil  Take it to task niece  drive it on  as fast as it  recoils  we do so in all our seafights and landfights too by our sailors and soldiers or we should not conquer and we are all sure you will overcome it And  why Because you  ought  So  we  think whatever  you  think And whose thoughts are to be preferred You may be wittier than we but if you are wiser we have lived some of us let me tell you to very little purpose thirty or forty years longer than you  I have written as long a letter as yours I may not write in so lively or so polite a style as my niece But I think I have all the argument on my side And you will vastly oblige me if you will shew me by your compliance with all our desires that you think so too If you do not you must not expect an advocate or even a friend in me dearly as I love you For then I shall be sorry to be called  Your Uncle ANTONY HARLOWE  Tuesday Two in the morning  Postscript  You must send me no more letters But a compliable one you may send But I need not have forbid you for I am sure this by fair argument is unanswerable I know it is I have written day and night I may say ever since Sunday morning only churchtime or the like of that But this is the last I can tell you from  A H  LETTER XXXIII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Thursday March  HAVING met with such bad success in my application to those of my own family I have taken a step that will surprise you It is no other than writing a letter to Mr Solmes himself I sent it and have his answer He had certainly help in it  For I have seen a letter of his as indifferently worded as poorly spelt Yet the superscription is of his dictating I dare say for he is a formal wretch With these I shall inclose one from my brother to me on occasion of mine to Mr Solmes I did think that it was possible to discourage this man from proceeding and that would have answer'd all my wishes It was worth the trial But you'll see nothing will do My brother has taken his measures too securely  To  ROGER SOLMES  Esq  Wednesday Mar  SIR  YOU will wonder to receive a letter from me and more still at the uncommon subject of it But the necessity of the case will justify me at least in my own apprehension and I shall therefore make no other apology for it  When you first came acquainted with my father's family you found the writer of This one of the happiest creatures in the world beloved by the best and most indulgent of parents and rejoicing in the kind favour of two affectionate uncles and in the esteem of every one  But how is this happy scene now changedYou was pleased to cast a favourable eye upon me You addressed yourself to my friends Your proposals were approved of by them approved of without consulting me as if my choice and happiness were of the least signification Those who had a right to all reasonable obedience from me insisted upon it without reserve I had not the felicity to think as they did almost the first time my sentiments differed from theirs I besought them to indulge me in a point so important to my future happiness But alas in vain And then for I thought it was but honest I told you my mind and even that my affections were engaged  But to my mortification and surprize you persisted and still persist  The consequence of all is too grievous for me to repeat You who have such free access to the rest of the family know it too well too well you know it either for the credit of your own generosity or for my reputation I am used on your account as I never before was used and never before was thought to deserve to be used and this was the hard the impossible condition of their returning favour that I must prefer a man  to  all others that  of  all others I cannot prefer  Thus distressed and made unhappy and all for your sake and thro' your cruel perseverance I write Sir to demand of you the peace of mind you have robbed me of To demand of you the Love of so many dear friends of which you have deprived me and if you have the generosity that should distinguish a man and a gentleman to adjure you not to continue an address that has been attended with such cruel effects to the creature you profess to esteem  If you really value me as my friends would make me believe and as you have declared you do must it not be a mean and selfish value A value that can have no merit with the unhappy object of it because it is attended with effects so grievous to her It must be for  your own sake  only not for  mine  And even in this point you  must  be mistaken for would a prudent man wish to marry one who has not a heart to give Who cannot esteem him Who therefore must prove a bad wifeAnd how cruel would it be to make a poor creature a bad wife whose pride it would be to make a good one  If I am capable of judging our tempers and inclinations are vastly different Any other of my sex will make you happier than I can The treatment I meet with and the obstinacy as it is called with which I support myself under it ought to convince  you of this were I  not  able to give so good a reason for this my supposed perverseness as that I cannot consent to marry a man whom I cannot value  But if Sir you have not so much generosity in your value for me as to desist for  my own  sake let me conjure you by the regard due to  yourself  and to your own future happiness to discontinue your suit and place your affections on a worthier object For why should you make  me  miserable and  yourself  not happy By this means you will do all that is now in your power to restore me to the affection of my friends and if That can be it will leave me in as happy a state as you found me You need only to say That you see there are no HOPES as you will perhaps complaisantly call it of succeeding with me And indeed Sir there cannot be a greater truth than this and that you will therefore no more think of me but turn your thoughts another way  Your compliance with this request will lay me under the highest obligation to your generosity and make me ever  Your wellwisher and humble servant CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    These most humbly present Thursday March  Dearest Miss  YOUR letter has had a very contrary effect upon me to what you seem to have expected from it It has doubly convinced me of the excellency of your mind and the honour of your disposition Call it  selfish  or what you please I must persist in my suit and happy shall I be if by patience and perseverance and a steady and unalterable devoir I may at last overcome the difficulty laid in my way  As your good parents your uncles and other friends are absolutely determined you shall never have Mr Lovelace if they can help it and as I presume  no other person is in the way I will contentedly wait the issue of this matter And forgive me dearest Miss but a person should sooner persuade me to give up to him my estate as an instance of my generosity because  he  could not be happy without it than I would a much more valuable treasure to promote the felicity of another and make his way easier to circumvent myself  Pardon me dear Miss but I must persevere tho' I am sorry you suffer on my account as you are pleased to think for I never before saw the Lady I could love And while there is any hope and that you remain undisposed of to some other happier man I must and will be  Your faithful and obsequious admirer ROGER SOLMES  Mr  JAMES HARLOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Thursday March  WHAT a fine whim you took into your head to write a letter to Mr Solmes to persuade him to give up his pretensions to youOf all the pretty romantic flights you have delighted in this was certainly one of the most extraordinary But to say nothing of what fires us all with indignation against you your owning your prepossession in a villain's favour and your impertinence to me and your sister and your uncles one of which has given it you home child How can you lay at Mr Solmes's door the usage you so bitterly complain ofYou know little fool as you are that it is your fondness for Lovelace that has brought upon you all these things and which would have happen'd whether Mr Solmes had honour'd you with his addresses or not  As you must needs know This to be true consider pretty witty Miss if your fond lovesick heart  can let you consider what a fine figure all your expostulations with us and charges upon Mr Solmes makeWith what propriety do you demand of  him  to restore to you your former happiness as you call it and  merely  call it for if you thought our favour so you would restore it to yourself since it is yet in your own power to do so Therefore Miss Pert none of your pathetics except in the right place Depend upon it whether you have Mr Solmes or not you shall never have your heart's delight the vile rake Lovelace if our parents if our uncles if I can hinder it No you fallen angel you shall not give your father and mother such a  son  nor me such a  brother  in giving yourself that profligate wretch for a  husband  And so set your heart at rest and lay aside all thoughts of him if ever you expect forgiveness reconciliation or a kind opinion from any of your family but especially from him who at present styles himself  Your Brother JAMES HARLOWE  P S  I know your knack at letterwriting If you send me an answer to this I'll return it unopen'd for I won't argue with your perverseness in so plain a caseOnly once for all I was willing to put you right as to Mr Solmes whom I think to blame to trouble his head about you  LETTER XXXIV Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Friday March  I Receive with great pleasure the early and chearful assurances of your loyalty and love And let our principal and most trusty friends named in my last know that I do  I would have thee Jack come down as soon as thou canst I believe I shall not want the others so soon Yet they may come down to Lord M's I will be there if not to receive them to satisfy my Lord that there is no new mischief in hand which will require his second intervention  For thyself thou must be constantly with me Not for my  security  The family dare do nothing but bully They bark only at distance But for my  entertainment  That thou mayst from the Latin and the English Classics keep my lovesick soul from drooping  Thou hadst best come to me here in thy old corporal's coat thy servant out of livery and to be upon a familiar foot with thee as a distant relation to be provided for by thy interest above I mean not in heaven thou mayst be sure Thou wilt find me at a little alehouse they call it an inn The WhiteHart most terribly wounded but by the weather only the signIn a sorry village within five miles from HarlowePlace Everybody knows HarlowePlaceFor like Versailles it is sprung up from a dunghil within every elderly person's remembrance Every poor body particularly knows it But that only for a few years past since a certain angel has appeared there among the sons and daughters of men  The people here at the Hart are poor but honest and have gotten it into their heads that I am a man of quality in disguise and there is no reiningin their officious respect There is a pretty little smirking daughter seventeen six days ago I call her my Rosebud Her grandmother for there is no mother a good neat old woman as ever filled a wickerchair in a chimneycorner has besought me to be merciful to her  This is the right way with me Many and many a pretty rogue had I spared whom I did not spare had my power been acknowleged and my mercy  been in time implored But th  Debellare superbos  should be my motto were I to have a new one  This simple chit for there is a simplicity in her thou wilt be highly pleased with All humble all officious all innocentI love her for her humility her officiousness and even for her  innocence  will be pretty amusement to thee while I combat with the weather and dodge and creep about the walls and purlieus of HarlowePlace Thou wilt see in her mind all that her superiors have been taught to conceal in order to render themselves less natural and more undelightful  But I charge thee that thou do not what I would not permit myself to do for the worldI charge thee that thou do not crop my Rosebud She is the only flower of fragrance that has blown in this vicinage for ten years past or will for ten years to come For I have look'd backward to the  havebeen's  and forward to the  willbe's  having but too much leisure upon my hands in my present waiting  I never was so honest for so long together since my matriculation It behoves me so to beSome way or other my recess may be found out and it will then be thought that my Rosebud has attracted me A report in my favour from simplicities so amiable may establish me for the grandmother's relation to my Rosebud may be sworn to And the father is an honest poor man Has no joy but in his RosebudO Jack spare thou therefore for I shall leave thee often alone spare thou my RosebudLet the rule I never departed from but it cost me a long regret be observed to my Rosebud Never to ruin a poor girl whose simplicity and innocence was all she had to trust to and whose fortunes were too low to save her from the rude contempts of worse minds than her own and from an indigence extreme Such an one will only pine in secret and at last perhaps in order to refuge herself from slanderous tongues and virulence be  induced to tempt some guilty stream or seek an end in the kneeincircling garter that peradventure was the first attempt of abandoned LoveNo defiances will my Rosebud breathe no  self  dependent  thee  doubting watchfulness indirectly challenging thy inventive machinations to do their worst will she assume Unsuspicious of her danger the lamb's throat will hardly shun thy knifeO be not thou the butcher of my lambkin  The less be thou so for the reason I am going to give theeThe gentle heart is touched by Love Her soft bosom heaves with a passion she has not yet found a name for I once caught her eye following a young carpenter a widow neighbour's son living to speak in her dialect  at the little whitehouse over the way  A gentle youth he also seems to be about three years older than herself Playmates from infancy till his eighteenth and her fifteenth year furnished a reason for a greater distance in shew while their hearts gave a better for their being nearer than ever For I soon perceived the Love reciprocal A scrape and a bow at first seeing his pretty mistress turning often to salute her following eye and when a winding lane was to deprive him of her sight his whole body turned round his hat more reverently d'off'd than before This answered for unseen I was behind her by a low courtesy and a sigh that Johnny was too far off to hearHappy Whelp said I to myselfI withdrew and in tript my Rosebud as if satisfied with the dumb shew and wishing nothing beyond it  I have examined the little heart She has made me her confident She owns she could love Johnny Barton very well And Johnny Barton has told her He could love her better than any maiden he ever sawBut alas it must not be thought of Why not be thought ofShe don't knowAnd then she sighed But Johnny has an aunt who will give  him an hundred pounds when his time is out and her father cannot give her but a few things or so to set her out with And tho' Johnny's mother says she knows not where Johnny would have a prettier or notabler wife yetAnd then she sighed againWhat signifies talkingI would not have Johnny be unhappy and poor for meFor what good would that do  me  you know Sir  What would I give By my soul my angel will indeed reform me if her friends implacable folly ruin us not bothWhat would I give to have so innocent and so good a heart as either my Rosebud's or Johnny's  I have a confounded mischievous oneby  nature  too I thinkA good motion nowandthen rises from it But it dies away presentlyA love of intrigueAn invention for mischiefA triumph in subduingFortune encouraging and supportingAnd a constitutionWhat signifies palliating But I believe I had been a rogue had I been a ploughboy  But the devil's in this sex Eternal misguiders Who that has once trespassed ever recovered his integrity And yet where there is not virtue which nevertheless we freelivers are continually plotting to destroy what is there even in the ultimate of our wishes with them  Preparation  and  Expectation  are in a manner everything  Reflection  indeed may be something if the mind be hardened above feeling the guilt of a past  trespass  But the  Fruition  what is there in that And yet That being the end nature will not be satisfied without it  See what grave reflections an innocent subject will produce It gives me some pleasure to think that it is not out of my  power  to reform But then Jack I am afraid I must keep better company than I do at presentFor we certainly harden one another But be not cast down my boy there will be time enough  to give thee and all thy brethren warning to choose another leader And I fansy thou wilt be the man  Mean time as I make it my rule whenever I have committed a very capital enormity to do some good by way of atonement and as I believe I am a pretty deal indebted on that score I intend before I leave these parts successfully shall I leave them I hope or I shall be tempted to do double the mischief by way of revenge tho' not to my Rosebud any to join an hundred pounds to Johnny's aunt's hundred pounds to make one innocent couple happyI repeat therefore and for halfadozen more  therefores  spare thou my Rosebud  An interruptionAnother letter anon and both shall go together  LETTER XXXV Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq    I HAVE found out by my watchful Spy almost as many of my charmer's motions as those of the rest of her relations It delights me to think how the rascal is caressed by the uncles and nephew and let into  their  secrets yet proceeds all the time by  my  line of direction I have charged him however on forfeiture of his present weekly stipend and my future favour to take care that neither my beloved or any of the family suspect him I have told him that he may indeed watch her egresses and regresses but that only to keep off other servants from her paths yet not to be seen by her himself  The dear creature has tempted him he told  them  with a bribe  which she never offered  to convey a letter  which she never wrote  to Miss Howe  he believes  with one inclosed  perhaps to me  But he declined it And he begged they would take no notice of it to  her  This brought him a stingy shilling great  applause and an injunction followed it to all the servants for the strictest lookout lest she should contrive some way to send itAnd about an hour after an order was given him to throw himself in her way and expressing his concern for denying her request to tender his service to her and to bring them her letter Which it will be  proper for him to report  that she has refused to give him  Now seest thou not how many good ends this contrivance answers  In the first place The Lady is secured by it against her own knowlege in the liberty allowed her of takeing her private walks in the garden For this attempt has confirmed them in their belief that now they have turned off her maid she has no way to send a letter out of the house If she had she would not have run the risque of tempting a fellow who had not been in her secret So that she can prosecute unsuspectedly her correspondence with me and Miss Howe  In the next place It will afford me an opportunity perhaps of a private interview with her which I am meditating let her take it as she will having found out by my Spy who can keep off everybody else that she goes every morning and evening to a woodhouse remote from the dwellinghouse under pretence of visiting and feeding a set of Bantampoultry which were produced from a breed that was her grandfather's and which for that reason she is very fond of as also of some other curious fowls brought from the same place I have an account of all her motions hereAnd as she has owned to me in one of her letters that she corresponds privately with Miss Howe I presume it is by this way  The interview I am meditating will produce her consent I hope to other favours of the like kind For should she not choose the place I am expecting to see her in I can attend her anywhere in the rambling Dutchtaste garden whenever she will permit  me that honour For my implement hight Joseph Leman has given me the opportunity of procuring two keys one of which I have given him for reasons good to the gardendoor which opens to the haunted coppice as tradition has made the servants think it a man having been found hanging in it about twenty years ago And Joseph upon the least notice will leave it unbolted  But I was obliged to give him previously my honour that no mischief shall happen to any of my adversaries from this liberty For the fellow tells me that he loves all his masters and only that he knows I am a man of honour and that my alliance will do credit to the family and after prejudices are overcome every body will think so or he would not for the world act the part he does  There never was a rogue who had not a salvo to himself for being soWhat a praise to  honesty  that every man pretends to it even at the instant that he knows he is pursuing the methods that will perhaps prove him a knave to the whole world as well as to his own conscience  But what this stupid family can mean to make all this necessary I cannot imagine My REVENGE and my LOVE are uppermost by turns If the latter succeed not the gratifying of the former will be my only consolation And by All that's good they shall feel it altho' for it I become an exile from my native country for ever  I will throw myself into my charmer's presence I have twice already attempted it in vain I shall then see what I may depend upon from her favour If I thought I had no prospect of that I should be tempted to carry her offThat would be a rape worthy of a Jupiter  But all gentle shall be my movements All respectful even to reverence my address to herHer hand shall be the only witness to the pressure of my  lipmy trembling lip I  know  it will tremble if I do not  bid  it tremble As soft my sighs as the sighs of my gentle Rosebud By  my  humility will I invite  her  confidence The loneliness of the place shall give me no advantage To dissipate her fears and engage her rellance upon my honour for the future shall be my whole endeavour But little will I complain of not at all will I threaten those who are continually threatening me But yet with a view to act the part of Dryden's lion To secure my Love or to let loose my vengeance upon my hunters  What tho' his mighty soul his grief contains  He meditates revenge who least complains  And like a lion slumb'ring in his way  Or sleep dissembling while he waits his prey  His fearless foes within his distance draws  Constrains his roaring and contracts his paws  Till at the last his time for fury found  He shoots with sudden vengeance from the ground  The prostrate vulgar passes o'er and spares  But with a lordly rage his hunters tears  LETTER XXXVI Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Sat night Mar  I HAVE been frighted out of my witsStill am in a manner out of breathThus occasion'dI went down under the usual pretence in hopes to find something from you Concern'd at my disappointment I was returning from the woodhouse when I heard a rustling as of somebody behind a stack of wood I was extremely surpris'd But still more to behold a man coming from behind the furthermost stack O thought I at that moment the sin of a prohibited correspondence  In the same point of time that I saw him he besought  me not to be frighted And still nearer approaching me threw open a horseman's coat And who should it be but Mr Lovelace I could not scream out yet attempted to scream the moment I saw a man and again when I saw who it was For I had no voice And had I not caught hold of a prop which supported the old roof I should have sunk  I had hitherto as you know kept him at distance And now as I recover'd myself judge of my first emotions when I recollected his character from every mouth of my family his enterprising temper and found myself alone with him in a place so near a byelane and so remote from the house  But his respectful behaviour soon dissipated these fears and gave me others lest we should be seen together and information of it given to my brother The consequences of which I could readily think would be if not further mischief an imputed assignation a stricter confinement a forfeited correspondence with you my beloved friend and a pretence for the most violent compulsion And neither the one set of reflections nor the other acquitted him to me for his bold intrusion  As soon therefore as I could speak I express'd with the greatest warmth my displeasure and told him that he cared not how much he exposed me to the resentments of all my friends provided he could gratify his own impetuous humour and I commanded him to leave the place that moment And was hurrying from him when he threw himself in the way at my feet beseeching my stay for one moment declaring that he suffer'd himself to be guilty of this rashness as I thought it to avoid one much greaterFor in short he could not bear the hourly insults he received from my family with the thoughts of having so little interest in my favour that he could not promise himself that his patience and forbearance  would be attended with any other issue than to lose me for ever and be triumphed over and insulted upon it  This man you know has very ready knees You have said that he ought in small points frequently to offend on purpose to shew what an address he is master of  He run on expressing his apprehensions that a temper so gentle and obliging as he said mine was to everybody but him and a dutifulness so exemplary inclining me to do my part to others whether they did theirs or not by me would be wrought upon in favour of a man set up in part to be reveng'd upon myself for my grandfather's envied distinction of me and in part to be reveng'd upon him for having given life to one who would have taken his and now sought to deprive him of hopes dearer to him than life  I told him he might be assur'd that the severity and illusage I met with would be far from effecting the intended end That altho' I could with great sincerity declare for a Single Life which had always been my choice and particularly that if ever I marry'd if they would not insist upon the man I had an aversion to it should not be with the man they disliked  He interrupted me here He hoped I would forgive him for it but he could not help expressing his great concern that after so many instances of his passionate and obsequious devotion  And pray Sir said I let me interrupt you in my turnWhy don't you assert in still plainer words the obligation you have laid me under by this your boasted devotion Why don't you let me know in terms as high as your implication that a perseverance I have not wish'd for which has set all my relations at variance with me is a merit that throws upon me the guilt of ingratitude for not answering it as you seem to expect  I must forgive him he said if he who pretended only to a comparative merit and otherwise thought no man living could deserve me had presumed to hope for a greater share in my favour than he had hitherto met with when such men as Mr Symmes Mr Wyerley and now lastly so vile a reptile as this Solmes however discouraged by myself were made his competitors As to the perseverance I mentioned it was impossible for him  not  to persevere But I must needs know that were  he  not in being the terms Solmes had proposed were such as would have involved me in the same difficulties with my relations that I now laboured under He therefore took the liberty to say that my favour to him far from increasing those difficulties would be the readiest way to extricate me from them They had made it impossible he told me with too much truth to oblige them any way but by sacrificing myself to Solmes They were well apprised besides of the difference between the two one whom they hoped to manage as they pleased the other who could and would protect me from every insult and who had  natural  prospects much superior to my brother's  foolish  views of a title  How comes this man to know so well all our foibles But I more wonder how he came to have a notion of meeting me in this place  I was very uneasy to be gone and the more as the night came on apace But there was no getting from him till I had heard a great deal more of what he had to say  As he hoped that I would one day make him the happiest man in the world he assured me that he had so much regard for my fame that he would be as far from advising any step that were likely to cast a shade upon my reputation altho' That step were to be ever so much in his own favour as I would be to follow such advice But since I was not to be permitted  to live single he would submit it to my consideration whether I had any way but  one  to avoid the intended violence to my inclinations My father so jealous of his authority Both my uncles in my father's way of thinking My cousin Morden at a distance My uncle and aunt Hervey aw'd into  insignificance  was his word My brother and sister inflaming every one Solmes's offers captivating Miss Howe's mother rather of party with them for motives respecting example to her own daughter  And then he ask'd me if I would receive a letter from his aunt Lawrance on this occasion For his aunt Sadleir he said having lately lost her only child hardly looked into the world or thought of it farther than to wish him marry'd and preferably to all the women in the world with me  To be sure my dear there is a great deal in what the man saidI may be allow'd to say This without an imputed  glow  or  throb  But I told him nevertheless that altho' I had great honour for the Ladies he was related to for his two aunts in particular yet I should not choose to receive a letter on a subject that had a tendency to promote an end I was far from intending to promote That it became me ill as I was treated at present to  hope  everything to  bear  everything and to  try  everything When my father saw my steadfastness and that I would die rather than have Mr Solmes he would perhaps recede  Interrupting me he represented the unlikelihood there was of that from the courses they had enter'd upon which he thus enumeratedTheir engaging Mrs Howe against me in the first place as a person I might have thought to fly to if push'd to desperationMy brother continually buzzing in my father's ears that my cousin Morden would soon arrive and then would insist upon giving me possession of my grandfather's estate in pursuance of the will which would render  me independent of my fatherTheir disgraceful confinement of meTheir dismissing so suddenly my servant and setting my sister's over meTheir engaging my mamma contrary to her own judgment against me These he said were all so many flagrant proofs that they would stick at nothing to carry their point and were what made him inexpressibly uneasy  He appealed to me whether ever I knew my papa recede from any resolution he had once fix'd especially if he thought either his prerogative or his authority concern'd in the question His acquaintance with our family he said enabled him to give several instances but they would be too grating to me of an arbitrariness that had few examples even in the families of princes An arbitrariness which the most excellent of women my mamma too severely experienced  He was proceeding as I thought with reflections of this sort and I angrily told him I would not permit my father to be reflected upon adding That his severity to me however unmerited was not a warrant for me to dispense with my duty to him  He had no pleasure he said in urging any thing that could be  so  construed for however well warranted  he  was to make such reflections from the provocations they were continually giving him he knew how offensive to  me  any liberties of this sort would beAnd yet he must own that it was painful to him who had youth and passions to be allow'd for as well as others and who had always valued himself upon speaking his mind to curb himself under such treatment Nevertheless his consideration for me would make him confine himself in his observations to facts that were too flagrant and too openly avowed to be disputed It could not therefore  justly  displease he would venture to say if he made this natural inference from the premises That if such were my father's behaviour to a  wife  who disputed not the imaginary  prerogative  he was so unprecedently fond of asserting what room had a daughter to hope he would depart from an  authority  he was so earnest and so much more concern'd to maintain familyinterests at the same time engaging an aversion however causelessly conceived stimulating my brother's and sister's resentments and selfish views cooperating and my banishment from their presence depriving me of all  personal  plea or intreaty in my own favour  How unhappy my dear that there is but too much reason for these observations and for this inference made likewise with more coolness and respect to my family than one would have apprehended from a man so much provok'd and of passions so high and generally thought uncontroulable  Will you not question me about  throbs  and  glows  if from such instances of a command over his fiery temper for my sake I am ready to infer that were my friends capable of a reconciliation with him he might be affected by arguments apparently calculated for his present and future good  He represented to me that my present disgraceful confinement was known to all the world That neither my sister nor brother scrupled to represent me as an obliged and favoured child in a state of actual rebellionThat nevertheless everybody who knew me was ready to justify me for an aversion to a man whom everybody thought utterly unworthy of  me  and more fit for my  sister  That unhappy as he was in not having been able to make any greater impression upon me in his favour all the world gave me to himNor was there but one objection made to him by his very enemies his birth his fortunes his prospects all unexceptionable and the latter splendid and  that  he thank'd God and my example was in a fair way of being removed for ever Since he had seen his error and was heartily sick of the courses he had follow'd which however were far less enormous than  malice and envy had represented them to be But of This he should say the less as it were much better to justify himself by his actions than by the most solemn asseverations and promises And then complimenting my  person  he assured me for that he always  loved  virtue altho' he had not follow'd its rules as he ought that he was still more captivated with the graces of my  mind  And would frankly own that till he had the honour to know me he had never met with an inducement sufficient to enable him to overcome an unhappy kind of prejudice to matrimony which had made him before impenetrable to the wishes and recommendations of all his relations  You see my dear he scruples not to speak of himself as his enemies speak of him I can't say but his openness in these particulars gives a credit to his other professions I should easily I think detect an hypocrite And  this  man particularly who is said to have allowed himself in great liberties were he to pretend to instantaneous lights and convictionsat his time of life too Habits I am sensible are not so easily changed You have always join'd with me in remarking that he will speak his mind with freedom even to a degree of unpoliteness sometimes and that his very treatment of my family is a proof that he cannot make a mean court to any body for interest sakeWhat pity where there are such laudable traces that they should have been so mired and choaked up as I may sayWe have heard that the man's head is better than his heart But do you really think Mr Lovelace can have a  very  bad heart Why should not there be something in  blood  in the human creature as well as in the ignobler animals None of his family are exceptionablebut himself indeed The Ladies characters are admirable But I shall incur the imputation I wish to avoid Yet what a look of censoriousness does it carry to take one to task for doing that justice and making those charitable  inferences in favour of one particular person which one ought without scruple to do and to make in the behalf of any other man living  He then again press'd that I would receive a letter from his aunt Lawrance of offer'd protection He said that people of birth stood a little too much upon punctilio as people of virtue also did But indeed Birth worthily liv'd up to was Virtue Virtue Birth the inducements to a decent punctilio the same the origin of both one How came this notion from him Else his aunt would write to  me  But she would be willing to be first appris'd that her offer would be well receiv'das it would have the appearance of being made against the liking of one part of my family and which nothing would induce her to make but the degree of unworthy persecution which I actually labour'd under and had further reason to apprehend  I told him that however greatly I thought myself obliged to Lady Betty Lawrance if This offer came from herself yet it was easy to see to what it led It might look like vanity in me perhaps to say That this urgency in him on this occasion wore the face of art in order to engage me into measures I might not easily extricate myself from I said that I should not be affected by the splendor of even a Royal title  Goodness  I thought was  Greatness  That the excellent characters of the Ladies of his family weigh'd more with me than the consideration that they were halfsisters to Lord M and daughters of an Earl That he would not have found encouragement from me had my friends been  consenting  to his address if he had only a  mere  relative merit to those Ladies Since in that case the very reasons that made me admire  them  would have been so many objections to their  kinsman    I then assur'd him that it was with infinite concern that I had found myself drawn into an epistolary  correspondence with him especially since that correspondence had been prohibitedAnd the only agreeable use I could think of making of this unexpected and undesired interview was to let him know that I should from henceforth think myself obliged to discontinue it And I hoped that he would not have the  thought  of engaging me to carry it on by menacing my relations  There was light enough to distinguish that he looked very grave upon this He so much valued my  free  choice he said and my  unbias'd  favour scorning to set himself upon a foot with Solmes in the compulsory methods used in that man's behalf that he should hate himself were he capable of a view of intimidating me by so very poor a method But nevertheless there were two things to be consider'd First That the continual outrages he was treated with the spies set over him one of which he had detected the indignities all his family were likewise treated with as also myself avowedly in malice to him or he should not presume to take upon himself to resent for me without my leave The artful wretch saw he would have lain open here had he not thus guarded All these considerations called upon him to shew a proper resentment And he would leave it to me to judge whether it would be reasonable for him as a man of spirit to bear such insults if it were not for my sake I would be pleased to consider in the next place whether the situation I was in a prisoner in my father's house and my whole family determined to compel me to marry a man unworthy of me and that speedily and whether I consented or not admitted of delay in the preventive measures he was desirous to put me upon  in the last resort only  Nor was there a necessity he said if I were actually in Lady Betty's protection that I should be his if I should see any thing objectible in his conduct afterwards  But what would the world conclude would be the end I asked him were I to throw myself into the protection of  his  friends but that it was with such a view  And what less did the world think  now  he asked than that I was confined that I  might not  You are to consider Madam you have not now an option and to whom it is owing that you have not and that you are in the power of those Parents why should I call them who are determin'd that you shall  not  have an option All I propose is that you will embrace such a protectionbut not till you have try'd every way to avoid the necessity for it  And give me leave to say that if a correspondence on which I have founded all my hopes is at this critical conjuncture to be broken off and if you are resolved not to be provided against the worst it must be plain to me that you will at last yield to That worstWorst to  me  onlyIt cannot be to  you  And  then  and he put his hand clenched to his forehead how shall I bear the supposition  Then  will you be That Solmes'sBut by all that's Sacred neither he nor your brother nor your uncles shall enjoy their triumphPerdition seize my soul if they shall  The man's vehemence frighten'd me Yet in resentment I would have left him but throwing himself at my feet again Leave me not thus I beseech you dearest Madam leave me not thus in despair I kneel not repenting of what I have vow'd in such a case as That I have supposed I revow it at your feetAnd so he did But think not it is by way of menace or to intimidate you to favour me If your heart inclines you and then he arose to obey your father your  brother  rather and to have Solmes altho' I shall avenge myself on those who have insulted me for their insults to myself and family yet will I tear out my heart from This bosom if possible with  my own hands were it to scruple to give up its ardors to a woman capable of such a preference  I told him that he talked to me in very high language but he might assure himself that I never would have Mr Solmes Yet that this I said not in favour to him And I had declared as much to my relations were there not such a man as himself in the world  Would I declare that I would still honour him with my correspondenceHe could not bear that hoping to obtain  greater  instances of my favour he should forfeit the  only one  he had to boast of  I bid him forbear rashness or resentment to any of my family and I would for some time at least till I saw what issue my present trials were likely to have proceed with a correspondence which nevertheless my heart condemned  And his spirit him the impatient creature said interrupting me for bearing what he did when he considered that the necessity of it was imposed upon him not by  my  will for then he would bear it chearfully and a thousand times more but by creaturesAnd there he stopp'd  I told him plainly that he might thank himself whose indifferent character as to morals had given such a handle against him for all It was but just that a man should be spoken evil of who set no value upon his own reputation  He offer'd to vindicate himself But I told him I would judge him by his own ruleby his  actions  not by his  professions    Were not his enemies he said so powerful and so determined and had they not already shewn their intentions in such high acts of even  cruel  compulsion but would leave me to my choice or to my desire of living single he would have been content to undergo a twelvemonth's probation or more But he was confident that one month would either complete all their purposes or render them abortive And I best  knew what hopes I had of my  father  's receding He did not know him if I had  any    I said I would try every method that either my duty or my influence upon any of them should suggest before I would put myself into any other protection And if nothing else would do would resign the envied estate and that I dared to say would  He was contented he said to abide that issue He should be far from wishing me to embrace any other protection but as he had frequently said in the last necessity But dearest creature said he catching my hand with ardor and pressing it to his lips if the yielding up that estate will doResign itand be mineAnd I will corroborate with all my soul your resignationThis was not ungenerously said my dear But what will not these men say to obtain belief and a power over one  I made many efforts to go and now it was so dark that I began to have great apprehensionsI cannot say from his behaviour Indeed he has a good deal raised himself in my opinion by the personal respect even to reverence which he paid me during the whole conference For altho' he flam'd out once upon a supposition that Solmes might succeed it was upon a supposition that would excuse passion if any thing could you know in a man pretending to love with fervor altho' it was so levell'd that I could not avoid resenting it  He recommended himself to my favour at parting with great earnestness yet with as great submission not offering to condition any thing with me altho' he hinted his wishes for another meeting Which I forbid him ever attempting again in the same placeAnd I'll own to you from whom I should be really blameable to conceal any thing that his arguments drawn from the disgraceful treatment I meet with of what I  am  to expect make me begin to apprehend that I shall be under an obligation to be either the one  man's or the other'sAnd if so I fancy I shall not incur your blame were I to say  which  of the two it must be You have said which it must  not  be But O my dear the Single Life is by far the most eligible to me  Indeed  it is And I yet hope to obtain the blessing of making that option  I got back without observation But the apprehension that I should not gave me great uneasiness and made me begin my letter in a greater flutter than he gave me cause to be in except at the first seeing him for then indeed my spirits failed me and it was a particular felicity that in such a place in such a fright and alone with him I fainted not away  I should add That having reproached him with his behaviour the last Sunday at church he solemnly assured me That it was not what had been represented to me That he did not  expect  to see me there But hoped to have an opportunity to address himself to my father and to be permitted to attend him home But that the good Dr Lewin had persuaded him not to attempt speaking to any of the family at that time observing to him the emotions his presence had put everybody in He intended no pride or haughtiness of behaviour he assured me and that the attributing such to him was the effect of that illwill which he had the mortification to find insuperable Adding That when he bowed to my mamma it was a compliment he intended generally to every one in the pew as well as to  her  whom he sincerely venerated  If he may be believed and I should think he would not have come purposely to defy my family yet expect favour from me one may see my dear the force of hatred which misrepresents all thingsYet why should Shorey except officiously to please her principals make a report in his disfavour He told me That he would appeal to Dr Lewin for his justification on this head adding that the whole conversation between them turned upon his desire to attempt to reconcile  himself to us all in the  face of the Church  and upon the Doctor's endeavouring to dissuade him from making such a public overture till he knew how it would be accepted But alas I am debarred from seeing that good man or any one who would advise me what to do in my present difficult situation  I fancy my dear however that there would hardly be a guilty person in the world were each  suspected  or  accused  person to tell his or her own story and be allowed any degree of credit  I have written a very long letter To be so particular as you require in subjects of conversation it is impossible to be short I will add to it only the assurance That I am and ever will be  Your affectionate and faithful friend and servant CL HARLOWE  You'll be so good my dear as to remember that the date of your last letter to me was the th of this instant March  LETTER XXXVII Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Sunday March  I Beg your pardon my dearest friend for having given you occasion to remind me of the date of my last I was willing to have before me as much of the workings of your  wise  relations as possible being verily persuaded that one side or the other would have yielded by this time And then I should have had some degree of certainty to found my observations upon And indeed what can I write that I have not already writtenYou know that I can do nothing but rave at your stupid persecutors  And That you don't like I have advised you to resume your own estate That you won't do You cannot bear the thoughts of having their Solmes And Lovelace is resolved you shall be his let who will say to the contrary I think you must be either the one man's or the other's Let us see what their  next  step will be As to Lovelace while he tells his own story having behaved so handsomely on his intrusion in the woodhouse and intended so well at Church who can say That the man is in the  least  blameworthy  Wicked people  to combine against so  innocent  a manBut as I said Let us see what their  next  step will be and what course you will take upon it and then we may be more inlighten'd  As to your change of style to your uncles and brother and sister since they were so fond of attributing to you a regard for Lovelace and would not be persuaded to the contrary and since you only strengthened their arguments against yourself by denying it you did but just as I would have done in giving way to their suspicions and trying what That would doBut ifBut ifPray my dear indulge me a littleYou  yourself  think it was necessary to apologize to  me  for that change of st  le to  them  And till you will speak out like a friend to her un  question  able friend I must teaze you a littleLet it run therefore for it will run  If then there be not a reason for this change of style which you have not thought fit to give me be so good as to watch as I once before advised you how the cause for it will come on Why shoul  it be permitted to steal upon you and you know nothing of the matter  When a person gets a great cold he or she puzzles and studies how it began how heshe got it And when that is accounted for down heshe sits contented and lets it have its course or takes a sweat or the like to get rid of it if it be very troublesome  So my dear before the malady you wot of yet wot  not  of grows so importunate as that you must be obliged to sweat it out let me advise you to mind how it comes on For I am persuaded as surely as that I am now writing to you that their indiscreet violence on one hand and his insinuating address on the other if the man be not a greater fool than any body thinks him will effectually bring it to This and do all his work for him  But let itIf it must be Lovelace or Solmes the choice cannot admit of debateYet if all be true that is reported I should prefer almost any of your other lovers to either unworthy as  they  also are But who indeed can be worthy of Miss Clarissa Harlowe  I wish you don't tax me of harping too much upon one string I should indeed think myself inexcusable so to do the rather as I am so bold as to imagine it is a point out of all doubt from fifty places in your letters were I to labour the proof if you would ingenuously own  Own what you'll say Why my Anna Howe I hope you don't think that I am already in love  No to be sure How can your Anna Howe have such a thoughtLove tho' so  short a word  has a  broad sound  with it What then shall we call it You have help'd me to a phrase that has a  narrower sound  with it but a pretty  broad  meaning nevertheless A  conditional kind of liking  that's itO my friend Did I not know how much you despise Prudery and that you are too young and too lovely to be a Prude  But avoiding such hard names let me tell you one thing my dear which nevertheless I have told you before and that is This That I shall think I have reason to be highly displeased with you if when you write to me you endeavour to keep from me any Secret of your heart  Let me add That if you would clearly and explicitly  tell me how far Lovelace  has  or has  not  a hold in your affections I could better advise you what to do than at present I can You who are so famed for prescience as I may call it and than whom no young Lady ever had stronger pretensions to a share of it have had no doubt reasonings in your heart about him supposing you were to be one day his No doubt but you have had the same in Solmes's caseWhence the ground for the hatred of the one and of the  conditional liking  of the other Will you tell me my dear what you have thought of his  best  and of his  worst  How far eligible for the  first  how far rejectible for the  last  Then weighing both parts in opposite scales we shall see which is likely to preponderate or rather which  does  preponderate Nothing less than the knowlege of the inmost recesses of your heart can satisfy my love and my friendship Surely you are not afraid to trust  yourself  with a secret of this nature If you are then you may the  more  allowably doubt  me  But I dare say you will not own either Nor is there I hope cause for either  Be pleased to observe one thing my dear that whenever I have given myself any of those airs of raillery which have seem'd to make you look about you when likewise your case may call for a more serious turn from a sympathizing friend it has not been upon those passages which are written tho' perhaps not  intended  with such explicitness don't be alarm'd my dear as leaves one little cause of doubt But only when you affect reserve when you give new words for common things when you come with your  curiosities  with your  conditional likings  and with your PRUDEencies mind how I spell the word in a case that with every other person defies all prudenceOvertacts of treason all these against the sovereign friendship we have vowed to each other  Remember that you found  me  out in a moment  You challeng'd me I owned directly that there was only my pride between the man and me for I could not endure I told you to think it in the power of any fellow living to give me a moment's uneasiness And then my man as I have elsewhere said was not such a one as yours So I had reason to impute full as much to my own inconsideration as to his  power  over me Nay  more  But still more to  yours  For you reason'd me out of the  curiosity  first and when the liking was brought to be  conditional  Why then you know I  throbb'd  no more about him  O  pray now  as you say now I have mentioned that my fellow was not such a charming fellow as yours let Miss Biddulph Miss Lloyd Miss Campion and me have your opinion how far  Figure  ought to engage us With a view to your own case however  Mind that  as Mr T' Antony saysAnd whether  at all  if the man be vain of it since as you observe in a former that vanity is  a stopshort pride  in such a one that would make one justly doubt the  worthiness of his interior  You our pattern so lovely in feature so graceful in person have none of it and have therefore with the  best  grace always held that it is not excusable even in a woman  You must know that this subject was warmly debated among us in our last conversation and Miss Lloyd wished me to write to you upon it for your opinion to which in every debated case we always defered I hope you will not be so much ingross'd by your more weighty cares as not to have freedom of spirits enough to enter upon the taskYou know how much we all admire your opinion on such topics which ever produces something new and instructive as you handle the subjects And pray tell us to what you think it owing that your man seems so careful to adorn that selfadorned person of his yet so manages that one cannot for one's heart think him a coxcombLet this question and the above tasks  divert and not displease you my dearOne subject tho' ever so important could never yet ingross your capacious mind If they should displease you you must recollect the many instances of my impertinence which you have forgiven and then say This is a mad girlBut yet I love herAnd she is my own  ANNA HOWE  LETTER XXXVIII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Monday March  YOUR last so sensibly affects me that I must postpone every other consideration however weighty to reply to it And this I will do very distinctly and with all the openness of heart which our mutual friendship demands  But let me observe in the first place  gratefully  observe That if I have in  fifty passages  of my letters given you such  undoubted  proofs of my value for Mr Lovelace that you have spared me for the sake of my  explicitness  it is acting by me with a generosity worthy of yourself  But lives the man think you who is so very bad that he does not give even a doubting mind reason at  one  time to be better pleased with him than at  another  And when that reason offers is it not just to express one's self accordingly I would do the man who addresses me as much  justice  as if he did  not  address me It has such a look of tyranny it appears so ungenerous methinks to use a man worse for his respect to one no other cause for disrespect occurring that I would not by any means be that person who should do so  But altho' I may intend no more than justice it will perhaps be difficult to hinder those who know the man's views from construing it as a partial  favour And especially if the eagerey'd observer has been formerly touch'd herself and would triumph that her friend had been no more able to escape than sheNoble minds emulative of perfection and yet the passion properly directed I do not take to be an  im  perfection neither may be allow'd a little generous envy I think  If I meant by this a reflection by way of revenge it is but a revenge my dear in the soft sense of the wordI love as I have told you your pleasantryAltho' at the time it may pain one a little yet on recollection when one feels in the reproof more of the cautioning friend than of the satirizing observer an ingenuous mind will be all gratitude upon it All the business will be This I shall be sensible of the pain in the present letter perhaps but I shall thank you in the next and ever after  In this way I hope my dear you will account for a little of that sensibility which you will find above and perhaps still more as I proceedYou frequently remind me by the  best example  that I must not spare  you  I am not conscious that I have written any thing of this man that has not been more in his dispraise than in his favour Such  is  the man that I think I must have been faulty and ought to take myself to account if I had not But if you think otherwise I will not put you upon  labouring the proof  as you call it My conduct must then have a faulty  appearance  at least and I will endeavour to rectify it But of this I assure you That whatever interpretation my words were capable of I  intended not  any reserve to you I wrote my heart at the timeIf I had had thoughts of disguising it or been conscious that there was  reason  for doing so perhaps I had not given you the opportunity of remarking upon my  curiosity  after his relations esteem for me nor upon my  conditional liking  and suchlike All I intended by the  first I believe I honestly told you at the time To that letter I therefore refer whether it make for me or against me And by the other that I might bear in mind what it became a person of my sex and character to  be  and to  do  in such an unhappy situation where the imputed love is thought an undutiful and therefore a criminal passion and where the supposed object of it is a man of faulty morals too And I am sure you will excuse my desire of appearing at those times the person I ought to be had I no other view in it but to merit the continuance of your good opinion  But that I may acquit myself of having reservesO my dear I must here break off  LETTER XXXIX Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Monday March  THIS letter will account to you my dear for my abrupt breaking off in the answer I was writing to yours of yesterday and which possibly I shall not be able to finish and send you till tomorrow or next day having a great deal to say to the subjects you put to me in it What I am now to give you are the particulars of another effort made by my friends thro' the good Mrs Norton  It seems they had sent to her yesterday to be here this day to take their instructions and to try what  she  could do with me It would at least I suppose they thought have this effect To render me inexcusable with  her  or to let  her  see that there was no room for the expostulations she had often wanted to make in my favour to my mamma  The declaration that my heart was  free  afforded them an argument to prove obstinacy and perverseness upon me since it could be nothing else that govern'd  me in my opposition to their wills if I had no particular esteem for another man And now that I have given them reason in order to obviate this argument to suppose that I  have  a preference to another they are resolved to carry their schemes into execution as soon as possible And in order to this they sent for This good woman for whom they know I have even a filial regard  She found assembled my papa and mamma my brother and sister my two uncles and my aunt Hervey  My brother acquainted her with all that had passed since she was last permitted to see me with my letters avowing my regard to Mr Lovelace as they all interpreted them with the substance of their answers to them and with their resolutions  My mamma spoke next and delivered herself to this effect as the good woman told me afterwards  After reciting how many times I had been indulged in my refusals of different gentlemen and the pains she had taken with me to induce me to oblige my whole family in one instance out of five or six and my obstinacy upon it O my good Mrs Norton said the dear Lady could you have thought that  my  Clarissa and  your  Clarissa was capable of so determin'd an opposition to the will of parents so indulgent to her But see what  you  can do with her The matter is gone too far to be receded from on our parts Her papa had concluded every thing with Mr Solmes not doubting her compliance Such noble settlements Mrs Norton and such advantages to the whole familyIn short she has it in her power to lay an obligation upon us all Mr Solmes knowing she has good principles and hoping by his patience  now  and good treatment  hereafter  to engage her gratitude and by degrees her love is willing to overlook All    Overlook  all my dear Mr Solmes to  overlook  all There's a word  So Mrs Norton if you are convinc'd that it is a child's duty to submit to her parents authority in the most important point as well as in the least I beg you'll try  your  influence over her  I  have none Her  papa  has none Her  uncles  neither Altho' it is her apparent interest to oblige us All for on that condition her grandfather's estate is not half of what living and dying is purpos'd to be done for her If any body can prevail with her it is  you  and I hope you will  heartily  enter upon this task with her  She ask'd Whether she was permitted to expostulate with them upon the occasion before she came up to me  My arrogant brother told her she was sent for to expostulate with his  sister  and not with  them  And  This  Goody Norton She is always  Goody  with him you may tell her that matters are gone so far with Mr Solmes that there is no going backOf consequence no room for  your  expostulation or  hers  either  Be assured of This Mrs Norton said my papa in an angry tone that we will not be baffled by her We will not appear like fools in This matter and as if we had no authority over our own daughter We will not in short be bully'd out of our child by a cursed rake who had like to have killed our only sonAnd so she had better make a merit of her obedience For comply she shall if I live independent as she thinks my father's indiscreet bounty hath made her of me her father Indeed since That she has never been what she was before An unjust bequestAnd it is likely to prosper accordinglyBut if she marry that vile Lovelace I will litigate every shilling with her Tell her so and that the Will  may  be set aside and  shall    My uncles join'd with equal heat  My brother was violent in his declarations  My sister put in with vehemence on the same side  My aunt Hervey was pleased to say There was no article so proper for parents to govern in as This of marriage And it was very fit mine should be obliged  Thus instructed the good woman came up to me She told me all that had passed and was very earnest with me to comply and so much justice did she to the task imposed upon her that I more than once thought that her own opinion went with theirs But when she saw what an immoveable aversion I had to the man she lamented with me their determin'd resolution And then examin'd into the sincerity of my profession that I would gladly compound with them by living single Of this being satisfy'd she was so convinc'd that this offer which would exclude Lovelace effectually ought to be accepted that she would go down altho' I told her it was what I had tender'd overandover to no purpose and undertake to be guaranty for me on that score  She went accordingly but soon return'd in tears being used harshly for urging this alternativeThey had a right to my obedience upon their own terms they said My proposal was an artifice only to gain time Nothing but marrying Mr Solmes  should  do They had told me so before They should not be at rest till it was done for they knew what an interest Lovelace had in my heart I had as good as own'd it in my letters to my uncles and brother and sister altho' I had most disingenuously declared otherwise to my mamma I depended they said upon  their  indulgence and my  own power  over them They had not banish'd me their presence if they did not know that their consideration for  me  was greater than mine for  them  And they  would  be obey'd or I never should be restor'd to their favour let the consequence be what it would  My brother thought fit to tell the good woman that her whining nonsense did but harden me There was a perverseness he said in female minds a Tragedypride that would make a romantic young creature such a one as me risque any thing to obtain pity I was of an age and a turn the insolent said to be fond of a loverlike distress And my grief which she pleaded would never break my heart it would sooner break That of the best and most indulgent of mothers He added That she might once more go up to me But that if she prevailed not he should suspect that the man they all hated had found a way to attach  her  to his interest  Everybody blam'd him for this unworthy reflection which greatly affected the good woman But nevertheless he said and nobody contradicted him that if she could not prevail upon her  sweet child  as it seems she had fondly called me she had best withdraw to her own home and there tarry till she was sent for and so leave her  sweet child  to her father's management  Sure nobody ever had so insolent so hardhearted a brother as I have So much resignation to be expected from me So much arrogance and to so good a woman and of so fine an understanding to be allowed in him  She nevertheless told him that however she might be ridiculed for speaking of the sweetness of my disposition she must take upon her to say that there never was a sweeter in the sex And that she had ever found that by mild methods and gentleness I might at any time be prevailed upon even in points against my own judgment and opinion  My aunt Hervey hereupon said it was worth while to reflect upon what Mrs Norton said And that she had sometimes allowed  herself  to doubt whether I had been begun with by such methods as generous tempers are only to be influenced by in cases where  their hearts are supposed to be opposite to the will of their friends  She had both my brother and sister upon her for This Who referr'd to my mamma whether she had not treated me with an indulgence that had hardly any example  My mamma said She must own that no indulgence had been wanting from  her  But she must needs say and had  often  said it that the reception I met with on my return from Miss Howe and the manner in which the proposal of Mr Solmes was made to me which was such as left nothing to my choice and before I had had an opportunity to converse with him were not what she had by any means approved of  She was silenc'd you will guess by whomwith My dear my dearYou have  ever  something to say something to palliate for this rebel of a girlRemember her treatment of you of meRemember that the wretch whom we so justly hate would not dare to persist in his purposes but for her encouragement of  him  and obstinacy to  us  Mrs Norton angrily to her go up to her once moreand if you think gentleness will doyou have a commission to be gentleIf it won't never make use of that plea again  Ay my good woman said my mamma try  your  force with her My sister Hervey and I will go up to her and bring her down in our hands to receive her father's blessing and assurances of everybody's love if she will be prevailed upon And in that case we will all love you the better for your good offices  She came up to me and repeated all these passages with tearsBut after what had passed between us I told her that she could not hope to prevail upon me to comply with measures so wholly my brother's and so much to my aversionAnd then folding me to her maternal bosom I leave you my dearest Miss said  sheI leave you because I  must  But let me beseech you to do nothing rashly nothing unbecoming your character If all be true that is said Mr Lovelace cannot deserve you If you  can  comply remember it is your  duty  to comply They take not I own the right method with so generous a spirit But remember that there would not be any merit in your compliance if it were  not  to be against your own will Remember also what is expected from a character so extraordinary as yours Remember it is in your power to unite or disunite your whole family for ever Altho' it should at  present  be disagreeable to you to be thus compelled your prudence I dare say when you consider the matter seriously will enable you to get over all prejudices against the one and all prepossessions in favour of the other And then the obligation you will lay all your family under will be not only meritorious in you with regard to  them  but in a few months very probably highly satisfactory as well as reputable to  yourself    Consider my dear mamma Norton said I  only  consider that it is not a small thing that is insisted upon nor for a short duration It is for my  Life  Consider too that all This is owing to an overbearing brother who governs everybody Consider how desirous I am to oblige them if a  single  ife  and breaking all correspondence with the man they hate because my brother hates him would do it  I consider everything my dearest Miss And added to what I have said do  you  only consider that if by pursuing your  own  will and rejecting  theirs  you  should  be unhappy you will be deprived of all that consolation which those have who have been directed by their  parents  altho' the event prove not answerable to their wishes  I  must  go repeated sheyour brother will say and she wept that I harden you by my  whining nonsense  'Tis indeed hard that so much regard should  be paid to the  humours  of one child and so little to the  inclination  of another But let me repeat that it is your  duty  to acquiesce if you  can  acquiesce Your father has given your brother's schemes  his  sanction and they are now  his  Mr Lovelace I doubt is not a man that will justify  your  choice so much as he will  their  dislike It is too easy to see that your brother has a  view  in discrediting you with all your friends with your uncles in particular But for that very reason you should comply if possible in order to disconcert his ungenerous measures I will pray for you and that is all I can do for you I must now go down and make a report that you are resolved never to have Mr SolmesMust IConsider Miss  Must  I  Indeed you mustBut of This I do assure you that I will do nothing to disgrace the part you have had in my education I will bear everything that shall be short of forcing my hand into  his  who never can have any share in my heart I will try by patient duty by humility to overcome them But death will I choose in any shape rather than That man  I dread to go down said she with so determin'd an answer They will have no patience with meBut let me leave you with one observation which I beg of you always to bear in mind  'That persons of prudence and distinguished talents like yours seem to be sprinkled thro' the world to give credit by their example to Religion and Virtue When such persons  wilfully  err how great must be the fault How ungrateful to that God who blessed them with such talents What a loss likewise to the world What a wound to Virtue But this I hope will never be to be said of Miss Clarissa Harlowe'  I could give her no answer but by my tears And I thought when she went away the better half of my heart went with her  I listened to hear what reception she would meet with below and found it was just such a one as she apprehended  Will  she or will she  not  be Mrs Solmes None of your whining circumlocutions Mrs NortonYou may guess who said this  Will  she or will she  not  comply with her parents will  This cut short all she was going to say  If I  must  speak so briefly Miss will sooner die than have  Anybody but Lovelace interrupted my brotherThis Madam This Sir is your meek daughter This is Mrs Norton's  sweet child  Well Goody you may return to your own habitation I am impowered to forbid you to have any correspondence with this perverse girl for a month to come as you value the favour of our whole family or of any individual of it  And saying this uncontradicted by anybody he himself shewed her to the doorNo doubt with all that air of cruel insult which the haughty Rich can put on to the unhappy Low who have not pleased them  So here Miss am I deprived of the advice of one of the most prudent and conscientious women in the world were I to have ever so much occasion for it  I might indeed write as I presume under your cover and receive  her  answers to what I should write But should such a correspondence be charged upon her I know she would not be guilty of a falshood for the world nor even of an equivocation And should she own it after this prohibition she would forfeit my mamma's favour for ever And in my dangerous fever some time ago I engaged my mamma to promise me that if I died before I could do anything for the good woman she would set her above want for the rest of her life should her eyes fail her or sickness befal her and she could not provide for herself as she now so prettily does by her fine needleworks c  What measures will they fall upon nextWill they not recede when they find that it must be a rooted antipathy and nothing else that could make a temper not naturally inflexible so sturdy  Adieu my dear Be you happyTo  know  that it is in your power to be so is all that seems wanting to make you so  CL HARLOWE  LETTER XL Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE  In continuation of the subject in Letter  XXXVIII    I WILL now tho' midnight for I have no sleep in my eyes resume the subject I was forced so abruptly to quit and will obey yours Miss Lloyd's Miss Campion's and Miss Biddulph's call with as much temper as my divided thoughts will admit The dead stillness of this solemn hour will I hope contribute to calm my disturbed mind  In order to acquit myself of so heavy a charge as that of having reserves to so dear a friend I will acknowlege and I thought I had over and over that it is owing to my particular situation if Mr Lovelace appears to me in a tolerable light And I take upon me to say that had they opposed to him a man of sense of virtue of generosity one who enjoy'd his fortune with credit who had a tenderness in his nature for the calamities of others which would have given a moral assurance that he would have been still less wanting in grateful returns to an obliging spiritHad they opposed such a man as this to Mr Lovelace and been as earnest to have me marry'd as now they are I do not know myself if they would have had reason to tax me with that invincible obstinacy which they lay to my charge And this whatever had been the  Figure  of the man Since the  Heart  is what we women should judge by in the choice we make as the best  security for the party's good behaviour in every relation of life  But situated as I am thus persecuted and driven I own to you that I have now and then had a little more difficulty than I wish'd for in passing by Mr Lovelace's tolerable qualities to keep up my dislike to him for his others  You say I must have argued with myself in his favour and in his disfavour on a supposition that I might possibly be one day his I own that I have And thus called upon by my dearest friend I will set before you both parts of the argument  And first  what occurred to me in his favour    At his introduction into our family his negative virtues were insisted uponHe was no gamester no horseracer no foxhunter no drinker My poor aunt Hervey had in confidence given us to apprehend much disagreeable evil especially to a wife of the least delicacy from a winelover And common sense instructed us that Sobriety in a man is no small point to be secured when so many mischiefs happen daily from excess I remember that my sister made the most of this favourable circumstance in his character while she had any hopes of him  He was never thought to be a niggard Not even ungenerous Nor when his conduct came to be inquired into an extravagant or squanderer His pride so far was it a laudable pride secured him from that Then he was ever ready to own his errors He was no jester upon sacred things Poor Mr Wyerley's fault who seemed to think that there was wit in saying bold things which would shock a serious mind His conversation with us was always unexceptionable even chastly so which be his actions what they would shew'd him capable of being influenc'd by  decent  company and that he might probably therefore be a  led  man rather than a  leader  in  other  And one late instance so late as last Saturday evening has raised  him not a little in my opinion with regard to this point of good and at the same time of manly behaviour  As to the advantage of birth that is of his side above any man who has been found out for me If we may judge by that expression of his which you was pleased with at the time  'That upon  true  quality and  hereditary  distinction if good sense were not wanting honour sat as easy as his glove'  That with as familiar an air was his familiar expression  'while none but the prosperous upstart MUSHROOM'D into rank another of his peculiars was arrogantly proud of it'  If I say we may judge of him by this we shall conclude in his favour that he knows what sort of behaviour is to be expected from persons of Birth whether he act up to it or not Conviction is half way to amendment  His fortunes in possession are handsome in expectation splendid So nothing need be said on that subject  But it is impossible say some that he should make a tender or kind husband Those who are for imposing upon me such a man as Mr Solmes and by methods so violent are not intitled to make this objection But now on this subject let me tell you how I have argued with myselfFor still you must remember that I am upon the extenuating part of his character  A great deal of the treatment a wife may expect from him will possibly depend upon herself Perhaps she must  practise  as well as  promise  obedience to a man so little used to controul and must be careful to oblige And what husband expects not thisThe  more  perhaps if he has not reason to assure himself of the preferable love of his wife before she became such And how much easier and pleasanter to obey the man of her choice if he should be even unreasonable sometimes than one she would not have had could she have avoided it Then I think as  the men were the framers of the matrimonial office and made  obedience  a part of the woman's vow she ought not even in  policy  to shew him that she can break thro'  her  part of the contract however lightly she may think of the instance lest  he  should take it into his head himself is judge to think as lightly of other points which  she  may hold more important But indeed no point so solemnly vow'd can be slight  Thus principled and  acting  accordingly what a wretch must that husband be who could treat such a wife brutallyWill Lovelace's  wife  be the only person to whom he will not pay the grateful debt of civility and goodmanners He is allow'd to be brave Who ever knew a brave man if a man of  sense  an universally base man And how much the gentleness of sex and the manner of our trainingup and education make us need the protection of the brave and the countenance of the generous let the general approbation which we are all so naturally inclin'd to give to men of that character testify  At worst will he confine me prisoner to my chamber Will he deny me the visits of my dearest friend and forbid me to correspond with her Will he take from me the Mistresly management which I had not faultily discharged Will he set a servant over me with licence to insult me Will he as he has not a  sister  permit his cousins Montague or would either of those Ladies  accept  of a permission to insult and tyrannize over meIt cannot beWhy then think I often do you tempt me O my cruel friends to try the difference  And then has the secret pleasure intruded itself to be able to reclaim such a man to the paths of virtue and honour To be a  secondary  means if I were to be his of saving him and preventing the mischiefs so enterprising a creature might otherwise be guilty of if he be such a one  In these lights when I have thought of him and that as a man of sense he will sooner see his errors than another  I own to you that I have had some difficulty to avoid taking the path they so violently endeavour to make me shun And all that command of my passions which has been attributed to me as my greatest praise and in so young a creature as my distinction has hardly been sufficient for me  And let me add that the favour of his relations all but himself unexceptionable has made a good deal of additional weight thrown into the same scale  But now in his disfavour  When I have reflected upon the prohibition of my parents The giddy appearance disgraceful to sex that such a preference would have That there is no manner of likelihood inflam'd by the rencounter and upheld by art and ambition on my brother's side that ever the animosity will be got over That I must therefore be at perpetual variance with all my own family Must go to  him  and to  his  as an obliged and halffortun'd person That his aversion to them all is as strong as theirs to him That his whole family are hated for his sake they hating ours in return That he has a very immoral character as to our sex That knowing this it is a high degree of impurity to think of joining in wedlock with such a man That he is young unbroken his passions unsubdued That he is violent in his temper yet artful I am afraid vindictive too That such an husband might unsettle me in all my own principles and hazard my future hopes That his own relations two excellent aunts and an uncle from whom he has such large expectations have no influence upon him That what tolerable qualities he has are sounded more in pride than in virtue That allowing as he does the excellency of Moral Precepts and believing the doctrine of future Rewards and Punishments he can live as if he despis'd the one and defy'd the other The probability that the taint arising from such free principles may go down into the manners of posterity  That I knowing these things and the importance of them should be more inexcusable than one who knows them not since an error  against  judgment is worse infinitely worse than an error  in  judgmentReflecting upon these things I cannot help conjuring you my dear to pray  with  me and to pray  for  me that I may not be push'd upon such indiscreet measures as will render me inexcusable  to  myself For that is the test after all the world's opinion ought to be but a secondary consideration  I have said in his praise that he is extremely ready to  own his errors  But I have sometimes made a great drawback upon this article in his disfavour having been ready to apprehend that this ingenuity may possibly be attributable to two causes neither of them by any means creditable to him The one that his vices are so much his masters that he  attempts  not to conquer them the other that he may think it policy to give up  one half  of his character to save the  other  when the  whole  may be blameable By this means silencing by acknowlegement the objections he cannot answer which may give him the praise of ingenuousness when he can obtain no other and when the  challeng'd  proof might bring out upon discussion other evils These you'll allow are severe constructions but everything his enemies say of him cannot be false  I will proceed by and by  SOMETIMES we have both thought him one of the most undesigning  merely  witty men we ever knew at other times one of the deepest creatures we ever convers'd with So that when in one visit we have imagin'd we fathom'd him in the next he has made us ready to give him up as impenetrable This my dear is to be put among the shades in his characterYet upon the whole you have been so far of his  party that you have contested that his principal fault is overfrankness and too much regardlesness of appearances and that he is too giddy to be very artful You would have it that at  the time  he says any thing good he means what he speaks That his variableness and levity are constitutional owing to sound health and to a soul and body that was your observation fitted for and pleased with each other And hence you concluded that could this  consentaneousness  as you call'd it of corporal and animal faculties be pointed by discretion that is to say could his vivacity be confined within the pale of  but  moral obligations he would be far from being rejectible as a companion for life  But I used then to say and I still am of opinion that he wants a  heart  And if he does he wants everything A wrong  head  may be convinc'd may have a right turn given it But who is able to give a  heart  if a heart be wanting Divine Grace working a miracle or next to a miracle can only change a bad heart Should not one fly the man who is but  suspected  of such a oneWhat O what do parents  do  when they precipitate a child and make her think better than she would otherwise think of a man of an indifferent character in order to avoid another that is odious to her  I have said that I think him vindictive Upon my word I have sometimes doubted whether his perseverance in his addresses to me has not been the more obstinate since he has found himself so disagreeable to my friends From that time I verily think he has been more fervent in them yet courts them not but sets them at defiance For this indeed he pleads disinterestedness I am sure he cannot politeness and the more plausibly as he is apprized of the ability they have to make it worth his while to court them 'Tis true he has declared and with too much reason or there would be no enduring  him that the lowest submissions on his part would not be accepted and to oblige me has offered to seek a reconciliation with them if I would give him hope of success As to his behaviour at church the Sunday before last I lay no stress upon that because I doubt there was too much outward pride in his intentional humility or Shorey who is not his enemy could not have mistaken it  I do not think him so deeply learn'd in human Nature or in Ethics as some have thought him Don't you remember how he stared at the following trite observations which every moralist could have furnish'd him with Complaining as he did in a halfmenacing strain of the obloquies raised against him  'That if he were innocent he should despise the obloquy If not revenge would not wipe off his guilt'  'That nobody ever thought of turning a sword into a sponge'  'That it was in his own power by reformation of an error laid to his charge by an enemy to make that enemy one of his best friends and which was the noblest revenge in the world  against his will  since an enemy would not  wish  him to be without the faults he taxed him with'  But the  intention  he said was the wound  How so I ask'd him when  That  cannot wound without the  application  'That the adversary only held the sword He himself pointed it to his breastAnd why should he resent mortally that malice which he might be the better for as long as he lived'  What could be the reading he has been said to be master of to wonder as he did at these observations  But indeed he must take pleasure in revenge and yet holds others to be inexcusable for the same faultHe is not however the only one who can see how truly blameable those errors are in another which they hardly think such in themselves  From these considerations From these  overbalances    it was that I said in a former that I would not be in Love with this man for the world And it was going further than prudence would warrant when I was for compounding with you by the words  conditional liking  which you so humorously railly  Well but methinks you say what is all this to the purpose This is still but reasoning But if you  are  in Love you  are  And Love like the vapours is the deeper rooted for having no sufficient cause assignable for its hold And so you call upon me again to have no reserves and soforth  Why then my dear if you will have it I think that with all his preponderating faults I like him better than I ever thought I should like him and those faults consider'd better perhaps than I  ought  to like him And I believe it is possible for the persecution I labour under to induce me to like him still moreEspecially while I can recollect to his advantage our last interview and as every day produces stronger instances of  tyranny  I will call it on the other sideIn a word I will frankly own since you cannot think any thing I say too explicite that were he  now  but a moral man I would prefer him to all the men I ever saw  So that This is but  conditional liking  still you'll sayNor I hope is it more I never was in  Love  and whether This be  it  or not I must submit to  you  But will venture to think it if it be no such  mighty  monarch no such unconquerable power as I have heard it represented and it must have met with greater encouragements than I think I have given it to be so  irresistible  Since I am persuaded that I could yet without a  throb  most willingly give up the  one  man to get rid of the  other    But now to be a little more serious with you If my dear my particularly unhappy situation  had  driven or  led  me if you please into a liking of the man and if that liking  had  in your opinion inclined me  to the other  L  should  you  whose mind is susceptible of the most friendly impressions who have such high notions of the delicacy of sex and who actually  do  enter so deeply into the distresses of one you love should  you  have pushed so far that unhappy friend on so very nice a subjectEspecially when I aimed not as you could  prove by fifty  instances it seems to guard against being found out Had you raillied me by word of mouth in the manner you do it might have been more in character especially if your friend's distresses had been surmounted and if she had affected Prudish airs in revolving the subject But to sit down to  write  it as methinks I see you with a gladden'd eye and with all the archness of exultationIndeed my dear and I take notice of it rather for the sake of your own generosity than for my sake for as I have said I love your raillery it is not so  very  pretty the delicacy of the subject and the delicacy of your own mind consider'd  I lay down my pen here that you may consider of it a little if you please  I RESUME to give you my opinion of the sorce which  figure  or  person  ought to have upon our sex And this I shall do both  generally  and  particularly  as to this man Whence you will be able to collect how far my friends are in the right or in the wrong when they attribute a good deal of prejudice in favour of one man and in disfavour of the other on the score of figure But first let me observe That they see abundant reason on comparing Mr Lovelace and Mr Solmes together to believe that this  may  be a consideration with me and therefore they believe it  is    There is certainly something very plausible and attractive as well as creditable to a woman's  choice  in  figure  It gives a favourable impression at first sight in which one wishes to be confirm'd And if upon further acquaintance we find reason so to be  we are pleased with our own judgment and like the person the better for having given us cause to compliment our own sagacity in our firstsighted impressions But nevertheless it has been generally a rule with me to suspect a fine figure both in man and woman and I have had a good deal of reason to approve my rule With regard to  men  especially who ought to value themselves rather upon their intellectual than personal qualities For as to our sex if a fine woman should be led by the opinion of the world to be vain and conceited upon her form and features and that to such a degree as to have neglected the more material and more  durable  recommendations the world will be ready to excuse her since a pretty fool in all she says and in all she does will please we know not why  But who would grudge this pretty fool her short day Since with her summer's sun when her butterflyflutters are over and the winter of age and furrows arrives she will feel the just effects of having neglected to cultivate her better faculties for then like another Helen she will be unable to bear the reflection even of her own glass and being sunk into the insignificance of a  mere old woman  she will be intitled to the contempts which follow that character While the  discreet matron  who carries  up  we will not in such a one's case say  down  into advanced life the everamiable character of virtuous prudence and useful experience finds solid veneration take place of airy admiration and more than supply the want of it  But for a  man  to be vain of his person how effeminate If such a one has genius it seldom strikes deep into intellectual subjects His cutside usually runs away with him To adorn and perhaps  intending  to adorn to render ridiculous that person takes up all his attention All he does is  personal  that is to say  for  himself All he admires  is  himself  And in spite of the corrections of the stage which so often and so justly exposes a coxcomb he generally dwindles down and sinks into that character and of consequence becomes the scorn of one sex and the jest of the other  This is generally the case of your fine figures and gay dressers of men Whence it is that I repeat that  mere person  in a man is a despicable consideration But if a man  besides  figure has learning and such talents as  would  have distinguish'd him whatever were his form then indeed  person  is an addition And if he has not run too egregiously into selfadmiration and if he has preserved his morals he is truly a valuable being  Mr Lovelace has certainly taste and as far as I am able to determine he has judgment in most of the politer arts But altho' he has a humorous way of carrying it off yet one may see that he values himself not a little both on his person and his parts and even upon his dress and yet he has so happy an ease in the latter that it seems to be the least part of his study And as to the former I should hold myself inexcusable if I were to add to his vanity by shewing the least regard for what is too evidently so much his  And now my dear let me ask you Have I come up to your expectation If I have not when my mind is more at case I will endeavour to please you better For methinks my sentences drag my style creeps my imagination is sunk my spirit serves me not only to tell you That whether I have little or much it is all devoted to the commands of my dear Miss Howe  CL HARLOWE  Postscript  The insolent Betty Barnes has just now fired me anew by reporting to me the following expressions of the hideous creature Solmes  'That he is  sure  of the coy girl and that with little labour to himself'  'That be I ever so averse to him beforehand he can  depend upon my principles and it will be a pleasure to him to see by what pretty degrees I shall cometo'  Horrid wretch  'That it was Sir Oliver's observation who knew the world perfectly well that  Fear  was a better security than  Love  for a woman's good behaviour to her husband altho' for his part to such a fine creature he would try what Love would do for a few weeks at least Being unwilling to believe what the old Knight used to averr That fondness spoils more wives than it makes good'  What think you my dear of such a wretch as this tutor'd too by that old surly  Misogynist  as he was deemed Sir Oliver  LETTER XLI Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Tuesday March  HOW willingly would my dear mamma shew kindness to me were she permitted None of this persecution should I labour under I am sure if that regard were paid to her prudence and fine understanding which they so well deserve Whether oweing to her or to my aunt or to both that a new trial was to be made upon me I cannot tell but this morning her Shorey deliver'd into my hand the following condescending letter  My dear girl  FOR so I must still call you since  dear  you may be to me in every sense of the wordWe have taken into particular consideration some hints that fell yesterday from your good Norton as if we had not at Mr Solmes's first application treated you with that condescension wherewith we have in all other instances treated you If it  had been so  my dear you were not excusable to be wanting in  your  part and to set yourself to oppose your father's will in a point he had enter'd too far into to recede with honour  But all yet may be well On your single will my child depends all our present happiness  Your father permits me to tell you that if you now at last comply with his expectations all past disobligations shall be bury'd in oblivion as if they had never been But withal that this is the last time that that grace will be offer'd you  I hinted to you you must remember that patterns of the richest silks were sent for They are come And as they  are  come your papa to shew how much he is determin'd will have me send them up to you I could have wish'd they might not have accompany'd this letterBut there is no great matter in  that  I must tell you that your delicacy is not to be  quite  so much regarded as I had once thought it deserved to be  These are the newest as well as richest that we could procure answerable to our station in the world answerable to the fortune additional to your grandfather's estate designed you and to the noble settlements agreed upon  Your papa intends you six suits three of them dress'd at his own expence You have an intire new suit and one besides which I think you never wore but twice As the new suit is rich if you chuse to make That one of the six your papa will present you with an hundred guineas in lieu  Mr Solmes intends to present you with a set of jewels As you have your grandmother's and your own if you choose to have the former newset and to make them serve his present will be made in money a very round sumwhich will be given in full property to yourself besides a fine annual allowance for pinmoney as it is called So that your objection against the spirit of a man you think worse of than he deserves will have no weight but you will be more independent than a wife of less discretion than we attribute to you perhaps  ought  to be You know full well that I who first and last brought a  still larger fortune into the family than you will carry to Mr Solmes had not a provision made me of near This that we have made for youWhere people marry to their liking terms are the least things stood uponYet should I be sorry if you cannot to oblige us all overcome a dislike  Wonder not Clary that I write to you thus plainly and freely upon this subject Your behaviour hitherto has been such that we have had no opportunity of entering minutely into the subject with you Yet after all that has passed between you and me in conversation and between you and your uncles by letter you have no room to doubt what is to be the consequenceEither child we must give up  our  authority or you  your  humour You cannot expect the one We have all the reason in the world to expect the other You know I have told you more than once that you must resolve to have Mr Solmes or never to be looked upon to be our child  The draught of the settlements you may see whenever you will We think there can be no room for objection to any of the articles There is still more in them in our family's favour than was stipulated at first when your aunt talk'd of them to you More so indeed than we could have ask'd If upon perusal of them you think any alteration necessary it shall be madeDo my dear girl send to me within this day or two or rather  ask  me for the perusal of them  As a certain person's appearance at church so lately and what he gives out everywhere make us extremely uneasy and as that uneasiness will continue while you are single you must not wonder that a short day is intended Thisdayfortnight we design it to be if you have no objection to make that I shall approve of But if you determine as we would have you and signify it to us we shall not stand with you for a week or so  Your sightliness of person may perhaps make some  think this alliance disparaging But I hope you won't put such a personal value upon yourself if you do it will indeed be the less wonder that  person  should weigh with you however contemptible the considerationin another manThus we parents in justice ought to judge That our two daughters are  equally  dear and valuable to us If so why should  Clarissa  think that a disparagement which  Arabella  would not nor we for her have thought any had the address been made to herYou will know what I mean by this without my explaining myself further  Signify to us now therefore your compliance with our wishesAnd then there is an end of your confinement An act of oblivion as I may call it shall pass upon all your former refractoriness And you will once more make us happy in you and in one another You may in this case directly come down to your papa and me in his study where we will give you our opinions of the patterns with our hearty forgiveness and blessings  Come be a good child as you used to be my Clarissa I have notwithstanding your past behaviour and the hopelesness which some have express'd of your compliance undertaken this one time more for you Discredit not my hopes my dear girl I have promised never more to interfere between your  father  and  you  if this my most earnest application succeed not I expect you down Love Your papa expects you down But be sure don't let him see any thing unchearful in your compliance If you come I will clasp you to my fond heart with as much pleasure as ever I press'd you to it in my whole life You don't know what I have suffer'd within these few weeks past nor ever will be able to guess till you come to be in my situation which is that of a fond and indulgent mother praying night and day and struggling to preserve against the attempts of more ungovernable spirits the peace and union of her family  But you know the terms Come not near us if you resolve to be undutiful But this after what I have written I hope you cannot be  If you come directly and as I said  chearfully  as if your heart were in your duty and you told me it was  free  you know I shall then as I said give you the most tender proofs how much I am  Your truly affectionate Mother  Think for me my dearest friend how I must be affected by this letter the contents of it so surprisingly terrifying yet so sweetly urgedO why cry'd I to myself am I obliged to undergo this severe conflict between a command that I cannot obey and language so condescendingly movingCould I have been sure of being struck dead at the altar before the ceremony had given the man I hate a title to my vows I think I could have submitted to have been led to it But to think of living  with  and living  for  a man one cannot abide what a sad thing is that  And then how could the glare of habit and ornament be supposed any inducement to one who has always held that the principal view of a good wife in the adorning of her person ought to be to  preserve  the affection of her husband and to  do credit  to his choice and that she should be even  fearful  of attracting the eyes of  others  In this view must not the very richness of the patterns add to my disgustsGreat encouragement indeed to think of adorning one'sself to be the wife of Mr  Solmes    Upon the whole it was not possible for me to go down upon the prescrib'd condition Do you think it wasAnd to  write  if my letter would have been  read  what could I write that would be admitted and after what I had written and said to so little effect I walked backward and forward I threw down with disdain the patterns Now to my closet retir'd I then quitting it now threw I myself upon the Settee now  upon this chair now upon that and then into one window then into anotherI knew not what to doAnd while I was in this suspense having again taken up the letter to reperuse it Betty came in reminding me by order That my papa and mamma waited for me in my papa's study  Tell my mamma said I that I beg the favour of seeing her here for one moment or to permit me to attend her any where by herself  I listen'd at the stair'sheadYou see my dear how it is cry'd my father very angrily All your condescension as your indulgence heretofore is thrown away  You blame your son's violence  as you call it I had some pleasure in hearing this but nothing else will do with her You shall  not  see her alone Is  my  presence an exception to the bold creature  Tell her said my mamma to Betty she knows upon what terms she may come down to us Nor will I see her upon any other  The maid brought me this answer I had recourse to my pen and ink but I trembled so that I could not write nor knew I what to say had I had steadier fingers At last Betty brought me these lines from my papa  Undutiful and perverse Clarissa  NO condescension I see will move you Your mother shall  not  see you nor will I Prepare however to obey You know our pleasure Your uncle Antony your brother and your sister and your favourite Mrs Norton shall see the ceremony performed privately at your said uncle's chapel And when Mr Solmes can introduce you to us in the temper we wish to behold you in we may perhaps forgive  his  wife altho' we never can in any  other  character our perverse daughter As it will be so privately performed cloaths and equipage may be provided afterwards So prepare to go to your uncle's for  an earlyday in next week We will not see you till all is over And we will have it over the sooner in order to shorten the time of your deserved confinement and our own trouble in contending with such a rebel as you have been of late I'll hear no pleas Will receive no letter nor expostulation Nor shall you hear from me any more till you have chang'd your name to my liking This from  Your incensed Father  If this resolution be adhered to then will my papa never see me moreFor I will never be That Solmes's wifeI will die first  Tuesday evening  HE this Solmes came hither soon after I had received my papa's letter He sent up to beg leave to wait upon me I wonder at his assurance  I said to Betty who brought me his message Let him restore a lost creature to her father and mother and then I may hear what he has to say But if my friends will not see  me  on  his  account I will not see him upon his  own    I hope Miss said Betty that you will not send me down with this answer He is with your papa and mamma  I am driven to despair said I I cannot be used worse I will not see him  Down she went with my answer She pretended it seems to be loth to repeat it So was  commanded  out of her affected reserves and gave it in its full force  O how I heard my papa storm  They were all together it seems in his study My brother was for having me turn'd out of the house that moment to Lovelace and my evil destiny My mamma was pleased to put in a gentle word for me I know not what it was But thus she was answer'd  My dear this is the provoking'st thing in the world in a woman of your good senseTo love a rebel as well as if she were dutiful What encouragement for duty is thisHave I not loved her as well as ever you did and  why  am I changed Would to the Lord your sex knew how to distinguish But the fond mother ever made a harden'd child  She was pleased however to blame Betty as the wench own'd for giving my answer its full force But my father praised her for it  The wench says That he would have come up in his wrath at my refusing to see Mr Solmes But my brother and sister prevailed upon him to the contrary  I wish he hadAnd were it not for his own sake that he had killed me  Mr Solmes condescended I am mightily obliged to him truly to plead for me  They are all in tumults How it will end I know notI am quite weary of my lifeSo happy till within these few weeksSo miserable now  Well indeed might my mamma say That I should have great trials  P S  The  idiot  such a one am I treated like is  begg'd  as I may say by my brother and sister They have desired that I may be consigned over intirely to their management If it be granted It  is  on my father's side I understand but not  yet  on my mother's what cruelty may I not expect from their envy jealousy and illwillI shall soon see by its effects if I am to be so consignedThis is a written intimation privately dropt in my Woodhousewalk by my cousin Dolly Hervey The dear girl longs to see me she tells me But is forbidden till she see me as Mrs Solmes or consenting to be his I will take example by  their  perseveranceIndeed I will  LETTER XLII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    AN angry dialogue a scoldingbout rather has passed between my sister and me Did you think I could scold my dear  She was sent up to me upon my refusal to see Mr SolmesLet loose upon me I thinkNo intention on their parts to conciliate I am to be given up to my brother and her I suppose by general consent  Every thing she said against me which carried force with it I will do justice to As I ask for your approbation or disapprobation of my conduct upon the facts I lay before you I should think it the sign of a very bad cause if I endeavoured to mislead my judge  She began with representing to me the danger I had been in had my father come up as he would have done had he not been hindered by Mr  Solmes  among the rest She reflected upon my good Mrs Norton as if she encouraged me in my perverseness She ridiculed me for my supposed esteem for Lovelace Was surprised that the  witty  the  prudent  nay the  dutiful  and  pious  so she sneeringly pronounced the word Clarissa Harlowe should be so strangely fond of a profligate man that her parents were forced to lock her up to keep her from running into his arms Let me ask you my dear said she how you now keep your account of the disposition of your time How many hours in the twentyfour do you devote to your Needle How many to your Prayers How many to Letterwriting And how many to LoveI doubt I doubt my little dear was her arch expression The latter article is like Aaron's rod and swallows up all the restTell me is it not so  To these I answered That it was a double mortification to me to owe my safety from my papa's indignation  to a man I could never thank for any thingI vindicated the good Mrs Norton with a warmth that her merit required from meWith equal warmth I resented her unsisterly reflections upon me on Mr Lovelace's account As to the disposition of my time in the twentyfour hours I told her it would better have become her to pity a sister in distress than to exult over herEspecially when I could too justly attribute to the disposition of some of her wakeful hours no small part of that distress  She raved extremely at this last hint But reminded me of the gentle treatment of all my friends my mamma's particularly before it came to This She said that I had discovered a spirit they never had expected That if they had  thought  me such a championess they would hardly have ventured to engage with me But that now the short and the long was that the matter had gone too far to be given up That now it was a contention between  duty  and  wilfulness  Whether a parent's authority was to yield to a daughter's obstinacy or the contrary That I must therefore bend or break that was all child  I told her that I wished the subject were of such a nature that I could return her pleasantry with equal lightness of heart But that if Mr Solmes had such merit in everybody's eye in  hers  particularly why might he not be a  brother  to me rather than a  husband  O child she thought I was as pleasant to the full as she was She began to have some hopes of me now But did I think she would rob her sister of her humble servant Had he first addressed himself to me said she something might have been said But to take my younger sister's refusal No no child it is not come to that neither Besides That would be to leave the door open in your heart for you know who child and we would fain bar him out if possible In short and then she changed both her tone and her looks had I been as forward as somebody to throw myself  into the arms of one of the greatest profligates in England who had endeavoured to support his claim to me thro' the blood of my brother then might all my family join together to save me from such a wretch and to marry me as fast as they could to some worthy gentleman who might oppor  tune  ly offer himself And now Clary all's out and make the most of it  Did not this deserve a severe return Do say it did to justify my replyAlas for my poor sister said IThe man was not  always  so great a profligate How true is the observation  That unrequited love turns to deepest hate  I thought she would have beat meBut I proceededI have heard often of my brother's danger and my brother's murderer When so little ceremony is made with me why should I not speak outDid he not seek to kill the  other  if he could have done it Would  he  have given him  his  life had it been in his powerThe  aggressor  should not  complain  And as to oppor  tune  offers would to heaven some one had offer'd oppor  tune  ly to somebody It is not my fault Bella the oppor  tune  gentleman don't come  Could  you  my dear have shewn more  spirit  I expected to feel the weight of her hand She did come up to me with it held up Then speechless with passion ran down half way of the stairs and then up again  When she could speakGod give her patience with me  Amen said I But you see Bella how ill you bear the retort you provoke Will you forgive me and let me find a sister in you as  I  am sorry if you have reason to think me unsisterly in what I have said  Then did she pour upon me with greater violence considering my gentleness as a triumph of temper over  her She was resolved she said to let everybody know how I took the wicked Lovelace's part against my brother  I wish'd I told her I could make the plea for  my  self which she might for  her  self That my anger was more inexcusable than my judgment But I presumed she had some other view in coming to me than she had hitherto acquainted me with Let me said I but know after all that has passed if you have anything to propose that I  can  comply with any thing that can make my  only  sister once more my friend  I had before upon her ridiculing me on my supposed character of  meekness  said that altho' I wished to be thought  meek  I would not be  abject  altho'  humble  not  mean  And here in a sneering way she cautioned me on that head  I replied that her pleasantry was much more agreeable than her anger But I wished she would let me know the end of a visit that had hitherto  between  us been so unsisterly  She desired to be informed in the name of  everybody  was her word what I was determined upon And whether to comply or notOne word for all My friends were not to have patience with so perverse a creature for ever  This then I told her I would do Absolutely break with the man they were all so determined against Upon condition however that neither Mr Solmes nor any other were urged to me with the force of a command  And what was this more than I had offered before What but ringing my changes upon the same bells and neither receding nor advancing one tittle  If I knew what other proposals I could make that would be acceptable to them all and free me from the address of a man so disagreeable to me I would make them I had indeed before offered never to marry without my father's consent  She interrupted me That was because I depended upon my whining tricks to bring my father and mother to what I pleased  A  poor  dependence I saidShe knew those who would make that dependence vain  And I  should  have brought them to my own beck very probably and my uncle Harlowe too as also my aunt Hervey had I not been forbidden their sight and thereby hindered from playing my pug's tricks before them  At least Bella said I you have hinted to me to whom I am obliged that my father and mother and everybody else treat me thus harshly But surely you make them all very weak Indifferent persons judging of us two from what  you  say would either think  me  a very artful creature or  you  a very spiteful one  You are  indeed  a very artful one for that matter interrupted she in a passion One of the artfullest I every knew And then followed an accusation so low so unsisterlyThat I nexttobewitch'd people by my insinuating address That nobody could be valued or respected but must stand like cyphers whereever I came How often said she have I and my brother been talking upon a subject and had everybody's attention till  you  came in with your bewitching  meek  pride and  humble  significance and then have we either been stopped by references to Miss Clarissa's opinion forsooth or been forced to stop ourselves or must have talked on unattended to by everybody  She paused Dear Bella proceedShe indeed seemed only gathering breath  And so I will said she Did you not bewitch my grandfather Could any thing be pleasing to him that  you  did not say or do How did he use to hang till he slabber'd again poor doting old man on your silver tongue Yet what did  you  say that  we  could not have said What did  you  do that  we  did not endeavour to doAnd what was all this for His  Last Will shewed what effect your  smooth  obligingness had upon himTo leave the acquired part of his estate from the next heirs his own sons to a grandchild to his  youngest  grandchild a  daughter  tooTo leave the familypictures from his sons to you because you could  tiddle  about them and tho' you now neglect their examples could wipe and clean them with your dainty hands The familyplate too in such quantities of two or three generations standing must not be changed because his  precious child  Alluding to his words in the preamble to the clauses in his Will in her favour  See p  humouring his old  fallal  taste admired it to make it all her own  This was too low too move me O my poor sister said I Not to be able or at least willing to distinguish between art and nature If I  did  oblige I was happy in it I looked for no further reward My mind is above art from the dirty motives you mention I wish with all my heart my grandfather had not thus distinguished me He saw my brother likely to be amply provided for  out  of the family as well as  in  it He desired that  you  might have the greater share of my papa's favour for it and no doubt but you  both  will You know Bella that the estate my grandfather bequeathed  me  was not half the real estate he left  What's all that to an estate in possession and left you with such distinctions as gave you a reputation of greater value than the estate itself  Hence my misfortune Bella in your Envy I doubt But have I not given up that possession in the best manner I could  Yes interrupting me she hated me for that  best manner  Specious little witch she called me Your  best manner  so full of art and design had never been seen thro' if you with your blandishing ways had not been put out of sight and reduced to positive declarationsHindered from playing your little whining  tricks curling like a serpent about your mamma and making her cry to deny you any thing your little obstinate heart was set upon  Obstinate heart Bella  Yes obstinate heart For did you ever give up any thing Had you not the art to make them think all was right you asked tho' my brother and I were frequently refused favours of no greater import  I knew not Bella that I ever asked any thing unfit to be granted I seldom asked favours for  myself  but for  others    I was a reflecting creature for this  All you speak of Bella was a long time ago I cannot go so far back into our childish follies Little did I think of how long standing this your lateshewn antipathy is  I was a reflecter again Such a  saucy meekness  such a  best manner  and such venom in wordsO Clary Clary Thou wert always a  twofaced  girl  Nobody thought I had two faces when I gave up All into my papa's management taking from his bounty as before all my little pocketmoney without a shilling addition to my stipend or desiring it  Yes cunning creatureAnd that was another of your  fetches  For did it not engage my fond papa as no doubt you thought it would to tell you that since you had done so grateful and dutiful a thing he would keep intire for your use all the produce of the estate left you and be but your steward in it and that you should be intitled to the same allowances as before Another of your  hookin's  ClarySo that all your extravagancies have been supported gratis  My extravagancies BellaBut did my papa ever give me anything he did not give you  Yes indeed I got more by that means than I should have had the conscience to ask But I have still the greater part to shew But  you  What have  you  to shewI dare to say not fifty pieces in the world  Indeed I have not  I believe youYour mamma Norton I supposeBut mum for that  Unworthy BellaThe good woman altho' low in circumstance is great in mind Much greater than those who would impute meanness to a soul incapable of it  What then have you done with the sums given you from infancy to squanderLet me ask you affecting archness Has has has Lovelace has your Rake put it out at interest for you  O that my sister would not make me blush for her It  is  however out at interestAnd I hope it will bring me interest upon interestBetter than to lie rusting in my cabinet as yours does  She understood me she said Were I a man she should suppose I was aiming to carry the County Popularity A croud to follow me with their blessings when I went to and from church and nobody else to be regarded were agreeable things Housetop proclamations I  hid not my light under a bushel  she would say that for me But was it not a little hard upon me to be kept from blazing on a SundayAnd to be hindered from my charitable ostentations  This indeed Bella is cruel in  you  who have so largely contributed to my confinementBut go on You'll be out of breath byandby I cannot wish to be  able  to return this usage  Poor  Bella And I believe I smiled a little too contemptuously for a sister  None of my saucy contempts rising in her voice None of my  poor Bella's  with that air of superiority in a younger sister  Well then  rich  Bella courtesyingthat will please you betterAnd it is due likewise to the hoards you boast of  Lookye Clary holding up her hand if you are not a little more  abject  in your  meekness  a little more  mean  in your  humility  and tre  t me with the respect due to an elder sisteryou shall find  Not that you will treat me worse than you  have done  BellaThat cannot be unless you were to let fall your uplifted hand upon meAnd that would less become you to  do  than me to  bear    Good meek creatureBut you were upon your overtures just nowI shall surprize everybody by tarrying so long They will think some good may be done with youAnd supper will be ready  A tear would stray down my cheekHow happy have I been said I sighing in the suppertime conversations with all my dear friends in my eye round the hospitable board  I met only with insult for thisBella has not a feeling heart The highest joy in this life she is not capable of But then she saves herself many griefs by her impenetrablenessYet for ten times the pain that such a sensibility is attended with would I not part with the pleasure it brings with it  She asked me upon my turning from her If she should say any thing  below  of my  compliances  You may say That I will do everything they would have me do if they will free me from Mr Solmes's address  This is all you desire at present  creeperon  What words she has But will not t'other man flame out and roar most horribly upon a prey's being snatch'd from his paws that he thought himself sure of  I must let you talk in your own way or we shall never come to a point I shall not matter his  roaring  as you call it I will promise him that if I ever marry any other man it shall not be till  he  is married And if he be not satisfied with such a condescension as this I shall think he  ought  And I will give any assurances that I will neither correspond with him nor see him Surely this will do  But I suppose then you will have no objection to see and converse on a civil foot with Mr Solmesas your papa's friend or so  No I must be permitted to retire to my apartment whenever he comes I would no more converse with the one than correspond with the other That would be to make Mr Lovelace guilty of some rashness on a belief that I broke with him to have Mr Solmes  And so that wicked wretch is to be allowed such a controul over you that you are not to be civil to your papa's friends at his own house for fear of incensing  him  When this comes to be represented be so good as to tell me what it is you expect from it  Everything  I said or  nothing  as she was pleased to represent itBe so good as to give it your interest Bella And say farther That I will by any means I can in the Law or otherwise make over to my papa to my uncles or even to my brother all I am intitled to by my grandfather's will as a security for the performance of my promises And as I shall have no reason to expect any favour from my papa if I break them I shall not be worth anybody's having And further still unkindly as my brother has used me I will go down to Scotland privately as his housekeeper I now see I may be spared here if he will promise to treat me no worse than he would do an hired oneOr I will go to Florence to my cousin Morden if his stay in Italy will admit of it And in  either  case it may be given out that I am gone to the  other  or to the world's end I care not whither it is said I am gone or do go  Let me ask you child if you will give your pretty proposal in writing  Yes with all my heart And I stept to my closet and wrote to the purpose I have mentioned and moreover a few lines to my brother with it expressing  'my concern for having offended him beseeching him to support with his interest the accompanying proposal disdaining subterfuge and art referring to him to draw up a writing to bind me to the observance of my promises declaring that what  the  law  would not establish my  resolution  shouldI told him That he could do more than anybody to reconcile my father and mother to me And I should be infinitely obliged to him if he would let me owe this favour to his brotherly mediation'  And how do you think Bella employed herself while I was writingWhy playing gently upon my harpsichord And  humming  to it to shew her unconcernedness  When I approached her with what I had written the cruel creature arose with an air of levityWhy love you have not written alreadyYou have I protestO what a ready penwomanAnd may I read it  If you please Bella  She read it and burst into an affected laugh How wiseones may be taken inThen you did not know that I was jesting with you all this timeAnd so you would have me carry down this pretty piece of nonsense  Don't let me be surprized at your seeming unsisterliness Bella I hope it is  but  seeming There can be  no  wit in such jesting as this  The folly of the creature How natural it is for people when they set their hearts upon anything to think everybody must see with their eyesPray dear child  what  becomes of your papa's authority  here  Who  stoops here  the  parent  or the  child  How does  this  square with the engagements actually agreed upon between your Papa and Mr Solmes What security that your Rake will not follow you to the  world'send  Pr'ythee pr'ythee take it back and put it to thy lovesick heart and never think I will be laughed at for being  takenin  by thy whining nonsense I know thee better my dearAnd with another spiteful laugh she flung it on my toilette and away she wentContempts for contempts as she passedThat's for your  poor Bella's  Nevertheless I inclosed what I had written in a few lines directed to my brother As modestly as I could accounting from my sister's behaviour for sending it down to him lest she having in her passion mistaken me as I said should set what I had written in a worse light than as I apprehended it deserved to appear in The following is the answer I received to it delivered to me just as I was going to bed His passion would not let him stay till morning  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    I Wonder that you have the courage to write to me upon whom you are so continually emptying your  whole female quiver  I have no patience with you for reflecting upon me as the aggressor in a quarrel which owed its beginning to my consideration for  you    You have made such confessions in a villain's favour as ought to cause all your relations to renounce you for ever For my part I will not believe any woman in the world who promises against her  avowed  inclination To put it out of your  power  to ruin yourself is the only way lest to prevent your ruin I did not intend to write but your tookind sister has prevailed upon me As to your going into Scotland that day of grace is overNor would I advise that you should go to  grandfatherup  your cousin Morden Besides that worthy gentleman might be involved in some fatal dispute upon your account and then be called the  aggressor    A fine situation you have brought yourself to to propose to hide yourself from your Rake and to have falshoods told to conceal youYour confinement at this rate is the happiest thing that could befal you Your Bravo's behaviour at church looking out for you is a sufficient indication of his power over you had you not so shamelesly acknowleged it  One word for allIf for the honour of the family  I cannot carry this point I will retire to Scotland and never see the face of any one of it more  JA HARLOWE  There's a brotherThere's flaming duty to a father and mother and unclesBut he sees himself valued and made of consequence and he gives himself airs accordingly  LETTER XLIII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Wednesday morning o'clock  MY aunt Hervey lay here last night and is but just gone from me She came up to me with my sister They would not trust my aunt without this illnatur'd witness When she enter'd my chamber I told her That this visit was a high favour to a poor prisoner in her hard confinement I kiss'd her hand She kindly saluting me said Why this distance to your aunt my dear who loves you so well  She own'd That she came to expostulate with me for the peace sake of the family For that she could not believe it possible if I did not conceive myself unkindly treated that I who had ever shewn such a sweetness of temper as well as manners should be thus resolute in a point so  very near  to my father and all my friends My mamma and she were both willing to impute my resolution to the manner I had been begun with and to my supposing that my brother had originally more of a hand in the proposals made by Mr Solmes than my father or other friends And fain would she have furnish'd me with an excuse to come off of my opposition Bella all the while humming a tune and opening this book and that without meaning but saying nothing After having shewed me that my opposition could not be of signification  my father's honour being engaged she concluded with inforcing upon me my duty in stronger terms than I believe she would have done the circumstances of the case consider'd had not my sister been present It would but be repeating what I have so often mentioned to give you the arguments that passed on both sides So I will only recite what she was pleased to say that carried with it the face of newness  When she found me inflexible as she was pleased to call it she saidFor her part she could not but say that if I were not to have either Mr Solmes or Mr Lovelace and yet to make my friends easy must marry she should not think amiss of Mr Wyerley What did I think of Mr Wyerley  Ay Clary put in my sister what say you to Mr Wyerley  I saw thro' this immediately It was said on purpose I doubted not to have an argument against me of absolute prepossession in Lovelace's favour Since Mr Wyerley everywhere proclaims his value even to veneration for me and is far less exceptionable both in person and mind than Mr Solmes And I was willing to turn the tables by trying how far Solme's terms might be dispens'd with since the same terms could not be expected from Mr Wyerley  I therefore desired to know Whether my answer if it should be in favour of Mr Wyerley would release me from Mr SolmesFor I own'd that I had not the aversion to  him  that I had to the  other    Nay she had no commission to propose such a thingShe only knew that my papa and mamma would not be easy till Mr Lovelace's hopes were intirely defeated  Cunning creature said my sisterAnd this and her joining in the questionbefore confirm'd me that it was a designed snare for me  Don't YOU dear Madam said I put questions that can answer no end but to support my brother's  schemes against meBut are there any hopes of an end to my sufferings and disgrace without having this hated man imposed upon me Will not what I have offer'd be accepted I am sure it ought I will venture to say That  Why niece if there be  not  any such hopes I presume you don't think yourself absolv'd from the duty due from a child to her parents  Yes said my sister I do not doubt but it is Miss Clary's aim if she does not fly to her Lovelace to get her estate into her own hands and go to live at  The Grove  in that independence upon which she builds all her perverseness And dear heart my little love how will you then blaze away Your mamma Norton your oracle with your Poor at your gates mingling so  proudly  and so  meanly  with the ragged herd Reflecting by your ostentation upon all the Ladies in the county who do not as you do This is known to be your scheme And the Poor  without  doors and Lovelace  within  with one hand building up a name pulling it down with the otherO what a charming scheme is thisBut let me tell you my pretty little frighty one that my papa's  living  Will shall controul my grandfather's  dead  one and That estate will be disposed of as my fond grandfather would have disposed of it had he lived to see such a change in his favourite In a word Miss it will be kept out of your hands till my papa sees you discreet enough to have the management of it or till you can  dutifully  by Law tear it from him  Fie Miss Harlowe said my aunt this is not pretty to your sister  O Madam let her go on This is nothing to what I have borne from Miss Harlowe She is either commissioned to treat me ill by her  envy  or by an  higher  authority to which I must submitAs to revoking the estate what hinders if I pleased I know my power but have not the least thought of  exerting it Be pleased to let my papa know that whatever be the consequences to myself were he to turn me out of doors which I should rather he would than to be confined and insulted as I am and were I to be reduced to indigence and want I would seek no resources that should be contrary to his will  For that matter child said my aunt were you to marry you must do as your  husband  will have you If that husband be Mr Lovelace he will be glad of any opportunity of embroiling the families more And let me tell you niece if he had the respect for you he pretends to have he would not be upon such defiances as he is He is known to be a very revengeful man and were I  you  Miss Clary I should be afraid he would wreak upon me that vengeance tho' I had not offended him which he is continually threatening to pour upon the family  Mr Lovelace's threaten'd vengeance is in  return  for threaten'd vengeance It is not everybody will bear insult as of late I have been forced to bear it  O how my sister's face shone with passion  But Mr Lovelace proceeded I as I have said twenty and twenty times would be quite out of the question were I to be generously treated  My sister said something with great vehemence But only raising my voice to be heard without minding her Pray Madam provokingly interrogated I was he not known to have been as wild a man when he was  at first  introduced into our family as he  now  is said to be Yet  then  the common phrases of  wild oats  and  black oxen  and suchlike were qualifiers and marriage and the wise's discretion were to perform wondersBut turning to my sister I find I have sai  too much  O thou wicked reflecterAnd what made  me  abhor him think you but the proof of those villainous freedoms that ought to have had the same effect upon you were you but half so good a creature as you pretend to be  Proof  did you say Bella I thought you had not  proof  But  you know best  Was not this very spiteful my dear  Now Clary would I give a thousand pounds to know all that is in thy little rancorous and reflecting heart at this moment  I might let you know for a much less sum and not be afraid of being worse treated than I have been  Well young Ladies I am sorry to see things run so high between you You know niece to me you had not been confined thus to your apartment could your mamma by condescensions or your papa by authority have been able to have done any thing with you But how can you expect when there must be a concession on  one  side that it should be on theirs If  my  Dolly who has not the hundredth part of your understanding were thus to set herself up in absolute contradiction to my will in a point  so  material I should not take it well of herIndeed I should not  I believe not Madam And if Miss Hervey had just such a brother and just such a sister you  may  look Bellaand if both were to aggravate her parents as my brother and sister do mineThen perhaps you might use her as I am used And if she hated the man you proposed to her and with as much reason as I do Mr Solmes  And loved a Rake and Libertine Miss as you do Lovelace said my sister  Then might she continued I not minding her beg to be excused from obeying But yet if she did and would give you the most solemn assurances and security besides that she never would have the man you disliked against your consentI dare say Miss Hervey's father and mother would sit down satisfy'd and not endeavour to force her inclinations  Sosaid my sister with uplifted hands  father  and  mother  now come in for their share  But if child reply'd my aunt I knew she  loved  a Rake  and suspected that she sought only to gain time in order to wiredraw me into a consent  I beg pardon Madam for interrupting you but if Miss Hervey could  obtain  your consent what further would be to be said  True child but she never should  Then Madam it never would be  That I doubt niece  If you do Madam can you think confinement and ill usage is the way to prevent the apprehended rashness  My dear this sort of intimation would make one but too apprehensive that there is no trusting to yourself when one knows your inclination  That apprehension Madam seems to have been conceived before this intimation was made or the least cause for it given Why else the disgraceful confinement I have been laid underLet me venture to say that my sufferings are rather owing to  designed  terror knowing there were too good grounds for my opposition than doubt of my conduct for when they were inflicted upon me first I had given no  cause  of doubt nor should there now be room for any if my discretion might be trusted to  My aunt after a little hesitation said But consider my dear what confusion will be perpetuated in your family if you marry this hated Lovelace  And let it be considered what misery to me Madam if I marry that hated Solmes  Many a young creature has thought she could not love a man with whom she has afterwards been very happy Few women child marry their first loves  That may be the reason there are so few happy marriages  But there are few firstimpressions  fit  to be encouraged  I am afraid so too Madam I have a very indifferent opinion of light and first impressions But as I have often said all I wish for is to have leave to live  single    Indeed you must not Miss Your father and mother will be unhappy till they see you marry'd and out of Lovelace's reachI am told that you propose to condition with him so far are matters gone between you never to have  any  man if you have not  him    I know no better way to prevent mischief on all sides I freely own itAnd there is not if  he  be out of the question another man in the world I can think favourably ofNevertheless I would give all I have in the world that he were marry'd to some other personIndeed I would Bella for all you put on that smile of incredulity  May be so Clary But I will smile for all that  If  he  be out of the question repeated my auntSo Miss Clary I see how it isI will go downMiss Harlowe shall I follow youAnd I will endeavour to persuade your papa to let my sister herself come up And a happier event may then result  Depend upon it Madam said my sister This will be the case My mamma and she will be both in tears but with this different effect My mamma will come down soften'd and cut to the heart but will leave her favourite harden'd from the advantages she will think she has over my mamma's tendernessWhy Madam it was for this very reason the girl is not admitted into her presence  Thus she run on as she went downstairs  LETTER XLIV Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    MY heart fluttered with the hope and the fear of seeing my mamma and with the shame and the grief of having given her so much uneasiness But it needed not She was not permitted to come But my aunt was so good as to return yet not without my sister And taking my hand made me sit down by her  She came she must own  officiously  she said this  once  more tho' against the opinion of my father But knowing and dreading the consequence of my opposition she could not  but  come  She then set forth to me my friends expectations from me Mr Solmes's riches three times as rich he came out to be as anybody had thought him the settlements proposed Mr Lovelace's bad character their aversion to him all in a very strong light but not a stronger than my mamma had before placed them in My mamma surely could not have given the particulars of what had passed between herself and me If she had my aunt would not have repeated many of the same sentiments as you will find she did that had been still more strongly urged without effect by her venerable sister  She said it would break the heart of my father to have it imagin'd that he had not a power over his child and that as  he  thought for my own good A child too whom they always had doated uponDearest dearest Miss concluded she clasping her fingers with the most condescending earnestness let me beg of you for  my  sake for  your own  sake for a  hundred  sakes to get over this averseness and give up your prejudices and make everyone happy and easy once moreI would kneel to you my dearest nieceNay I  will  kneel to you  And down she dropp'd and I with her kneeling to her and beseeching her not to kneel clasping my arms about her and bathing her worthy bosom with my tears  Oh rise rise my beloved aunt said I You cut me to the heart with this condescending goodness  Say then my dearest niece say then that you will oblige all your friends If you love us I  beseech  you do  How can I promise what I can sooner choose to die than to perform  Say then my dear you'll  consider  of it Say you will but  reason  with yourself Give us but hopes Don't let me intreat and  thus  intreat in vain For still she kneeled and I by her  What a hard case is mineCould I but  doubt  I know I could  conquer  That which is an inducement to my friends is none at all to meHow often my dearest aunt must I repeat the same thingLet me but be singleCannot I live single Let me be sent as I have proposed to Scotland to Florence anywhither Let me be sent a slave to the Indies anywhither Any of these I will consent to But I cannot  cannot  think of giving my vows to a man I cannot endure  Well then rising Bella silently with uplifted hands reproaching my supposed perverseness I see nothing can prevail with you to oblige us  What  can  I do my dearest aunt Hervey What  can  I do Were I capable of giving a hope I meant not to inlarge then could I say I would  consider  of your kind advice But I would rather be thought  perverse  than  insincere  Is there however no  medium  Can  nothing  be thought of Will  nothing  do but to have a man who is the  more  disgustful to me because he is unjust in the very articles he offers  Who now Clary said my sister do you reflect upon Consider That  Make not invidious applications of what I say Bella It may not be look'd upon in the same light by every one The  giver  and the  accepter  are principally answerable in an unjust donation While I think of it in this light I should be inexcusable to be the latter But why do I enter upon a  supposition  of this nature My heart as I have often  often  said recoils at the  thoughts  of the man in every lightWhose father but mine agrees upon articles where there is no prospect of a liking Where the direct contrary is avow'd all along avow'd without  the least variation or  shadow  of a change of sentimentBut it is not my father's doing originally O my cruel cruel brother to cause a measure to be forced upon me which he would not behave tolerably under were the like to be offer'd to him  The girl is got into her altitudes aunt Hervey said my sister You see Madam she spares nobody Be pleased to let her know what she has to trust to Nothing is to be done with her Pray Madam pronounce her doom  My aunt retir'd to the window weeping with my sister in her hand I cannot indeed I cannot Miss Harlowe said she softly but yet I heard every word she said There is great hardship in her case She is a noble child after all What pity things are gone so far But Mr Solmes ought to be told to desist  O Madam said my sister in a kind of loud whisper are  you  caught too by the little SyrenMy mamma did well not to come upI question whether my papa himself after his first indignation would not be turn'd round by her Nobody but my brother can do anything with her I am sure  Don't think of your brother's coming up said my aunt still in a low voiceHe is too furious by much I see no obstinacy no perverseness in her manner If your brother comes I will not be answerable for the consequences For I thought twice or thrice she would have gone into fits  O Madam she has a strong heartAnd you see there is no prevailing upon her tho' you were upon your knees to her  My sister left my aunt musing at the window with her back towards us and took that opportunity to insult me still more barbarously For stepping to my closet she took up the patterns which my mamma had sent me up and bringing them to me she spread them upon the chair by me and offering one and then another upon her sleeve and  shoulder Thus she ran on with great seeming tranquillity but whisperingly that my aunt might not hear her  This  Clary is a pretty pattern enough But  This  is quite  charming  I would advise you to make your appearance in it And  This  were I you should be my wedding nightgownand  This  my second dress'd suit Won't you give orders love to have your grandmother's jewels new setOr will you think to shew away in the new ones that Mr Solmes intends to present to you He talks of laying out two or three thousand pounds in presents child Dear heartHow gorgeously will you be array'dWhat silent my dear mamma Norton's  sweet dear  What silent stillBut Clary won't you have a Velvet suit It would cut a great figure in a country church you know And the weather may bear it for a month yet to come Crimson Velvet suppose Such a fine complection as yours how would it be set off by it What an agreeable blush would it give youHighho mocking me for I sighed to be thus fooled with And do you sigh loveWell then as it will be a solemn wedding what think you of  black  Velvet childSilent still ClaryBlack Velvet so fair as you are with those charming eyes gleaming thro' a wintry cloud like an April SunDoes not Lovelace tell you they are charming eyesHow lovely will you appear to every oneWhat silent still loveBut about your laces Clary  She would have gone on still further had not my aunt advanced towards us wiping her eyesWhat whispering Ladies You seem so easy and so pleas'd Miss Harlowe with your private conference that I hope I shall carry down good news  I am only giving her my opinion of her patterns  here  Unask'd indeedBut she seems by her silence to approve of my judgment  O Bella said I that Mr Lovelace had not taken you at your wordYou had before now been exercising  your judgment on your own account And  I  had been happy as well as  you  Was it my fault I pray you that it was not soO how she rav'd  To be so ready to  give  Bella and so loth to  take  is not very fair in you  The poor Bella descended to call names  Why sister said I you are as angry as if there were more in the hint than possibly might be designed My wish is sincere for both our sakesfor the whole family's sakeAnd what good now is there in itDo not do not dear Bella give me cause to suspect that I have found a reason for your unsisterly behaviour to me and which till now was wholly unaccountable from sister to sister  Fie fie Miss Clary said my aunt  My sister was more and more outrageous  O how much fitter said I to be a  jest  than a  jester  But now Bella turn the glass to you and see how poorly sits the robe upon your own shoulders which you have been so unmercifully fixing upon mine  Fie fie Miss Clary repeated my aunt  And fie fie likewise good Madam to Miss Harlowe you would say were you to have heard her barbarous insults upon me  Let us go Madam said my sister with great violence let us leave the creature to swell till she bursts with her own poisonThe last time I will ever come near her in the mind I am in  It is so easy a thing return'd I were I to be mean enough to follow an example that is so censureable in the setter of it to vanquish such a teazing spirit as yours with its own blunt weapons that I am amaz'd you will provoke meYet Bella since you  will  go for she had hurry'd to the door forgive me I do you And you have a double reason to do so both from eldership and the offence so studiously given to one in afflictionBut may  you  be happy tho'  I  never shallMay  you  never have half  the trials  I  have had Be this your comfort that you cannot have a sister to treat  you  as you have treated  me  And so God bless you  O thou art aAnd down she flung without saying what  Permit me Madam said I to my aunt sinking down and clasping her knees with my arms to detain you one momentNot to say any thing about my poor sisterShe is her own punisherOnly to thank you for all your condescending goodness to me I only beg of you not to impute to obstinacy the immoveableness I have shewn to so tender a friend and to forgive me every thing I have said or done amiss in your presence For it has not proceeded from inward rancour to the poor Bella But I will be bold to say that neither She nor my Brother nor even my Father himself knows what a heart they have set a bleeding  I saw to my comfort what effect my sister's absence wrought for meRise my nobleminded niececharming creatureThose were her kind words kneel not to meKeep to yourself what I now say to you I admire you more than I can expressAnd if you can forbear claiming your estate and can resolve to avoid Lovelace you will continue to be the greatest miracle I ever knew at your yearsBut I must hasten down after your sisterThese are my last words to you Conform to your father's will if you possibly can How meritorious will it be in you to do so Pray to God to  enable  you to conform You don't know what may be done  Only my dear aunt one word  one  word more for she was goingSpeak up all you can for my dear Mrs Norton She is but low in the world Should ill health overtake her she may not know how to live without my mamma's favour I shall have no means to help her for I will want necessaries before I will assert my right And I do assure you  she has said so many things to me in behalf of my resigning to my father's will that her arguments have not a little contributed to make me resolve to avoid the extremities which nevertheless I pray to God they do not at last force me upon And yet they deprive me of her advice and think unjustly of one of the most excellent of women  I am glad to hear you say This And take  This  and  This  and  This  my charming niece for so she call'd me at every word almost kissing me earnestly and clasping her arms about my neck And God protect you and direct you But you  must  submit Indeed you  must  Some  one day  in a month from  This  is all the choice that is left you  And this I suppose was the doom my sister call'd for yet not worse than what had been pronounced upon me before  She repeated these last sentences louder than the former And remember Miss added she it is your  duty  to complyAnd down she went leaving me with my heart full and my eyes runing over  The very repetition of this fills me with almost equal concern to that which I felt at the time I can write no more mistinesses of all the colours in the rainbow twinkling upon my deluged eye  Wednesday Five o'Clock  I WILL add a few linesMy aunt as she went down from me was met at the foot of the stairs by my sister who seemed to think she had stay'd a good while after her And hearing her last words prescribing to me implicit duty praised her for it and exclaim'd against my obstinacy with Did you ever hear of such perverseness Madam Could you have thought that your Clarissa and every body's Clarissa was such a girlAnd who as  you  said is to submit her father or she  My aunt said something in answer to her compassionating  me as I thought by her accent But I heard not the words  Such a strange perseverance in a measure so unreasonableBut my brother and sister are continually misrepresenting all I say and do and I am deprived of the opportunity of defending myselfMy sister says  See p    that had they thought me such a championess they would not have engaged with me And now not knowing how to reconcile my supposed obstinacy with my general character and natural temper they seem to hope to tire me out and resolve to vary their measures accordingly My brother you see  In his Lett p    is determin'd to carry this point or to abandon Harloweplace and never to see it moreSo they are to lose a son or to conquer a daughterthe perversest and most ingrateful that ever parents hadThis is the light he places things in And has undertaken it seems to subdue me if  his  advice be followed It will be  further  try'd  that  I am convinced of and what will be their next measure who can divine  I shall dispatch with this my answer to yours of Sunday last begun on Monday  See Lett  xl  but which is not yet quite finish'd It is too long to copy I have not time for it In it I have been very free with you my dear in more places than one I cannot say that I am pleas'd with all I have writtenYet will not now alter itMy mind is not at ease enough for the subjectDon't be angry with me Yet if you can excuse one or two passages it will be because they were written by  Your CLARISSA HARLOWE  END of  VOL I
