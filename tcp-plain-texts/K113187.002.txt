subject  THE HISTORY O  ENGLISH POETRY  SECT I  IF Chaucer had not existed the compositions of John Gower the next poet in succession would alone have been sufficient to rescue the reigns of Edward the third and Richard the second from the imputation of barbarism His education was liberal and uncircumscribed his course of reading extensive and he tempered his severer studies with a knowledge of life By a critical cultivation of his native language he laboured to reform its irregularities and to establish an English style  See supr vol i pag  In these respects he resembled his friend and cotemporary Chaucer  It is certain that they both lived and wrote together But I have considered Chaucer first among other reaso  s h  re  fter given as Gower survived him Chaucer died October aged years Gower died  but he participated no considerable portion of Chaucer's spirit imagination and  elegance His language is tolerably perspicuous and his ver  i  ication often harmonious but his poetry is of a grave and sententious turn He has much good sense solid reflection and useful observation But he is serious and didactic on all occasions he preserves the tone of the scholar and the moralist on the most lively topics For this reason he seems to have been characterised by Chaucer with the appellation of the MORALL Gower  Troil Cress ad calc pag edit Urr ut supr  But his talent is not confined to English verse only He wrote also in Latin and copi  d Ovid's elegiacs with some degree of purity and with fewer false quantities and corrupt phrases than any of our countrymen had yet exhibited since the twelfth century  Gower's capital work consisting of three parts only the last of which properly furnishes matter for our present enquiry is entitled SPECULUM MEDITANTIS VOX CLAMANTIS CONFESSIO AMANTIS It was finished at least the third part in the year  CONFESS AMANT Prol fol a col Imprinted at London in Flete  rete by Thomas Berthelette the xii daie of March ann folio This edition is here always cited  The SPECULUM MEDITANTIS or the  Mirrour of Meditation  is written in French rhymes in ten books  Bibl Bodl MSS Bodl NE F And MSS Fairf  This tract which was never printed displays the general nature of virtue and vice enumerates the felicities of conjugal fidelity by examples selected from various authors and describes the path which the reprobate ought to pursue for the recovery of the divine grace The VOX CLAMANTIS or the  Voice of one crying in the Wilderness  which was also never printed contains seven books of Latin elegiacs This work is chiefly historical and is little more than a metrical chronicle of the insurrection of the commons in the reign of king Richard the second The best and most beautiful manuscript of it is in the library of All Souls college at Oxford with a dedication in Latin verse addressed by the author  when he was old and blind to archbishop Arundel  MSS Num It occurs more than once in the Bodleian library and I believe  often in private hands There is a fine manuscript of it in the British Museum It was written in the year as appears by the following line MSS Bodl  Hos ego BIS DENO Ricardi regis in anno  The CONFESSIO AMANTIS or the  Lover's Confession  is an English poem in eight books first printed by Caxton in the year It was written at the command of Richard the second who meeting our poet Gower rowing on the Thames near London invited him into the royal barge and after much conversation requested him to  book some new thing  TO THE REDER in Berthlette's edition From the PROLOGUE See supr vol i p Notes    This tripartite work is represented by three volumes on Gower's curious tomb in the conventual church of Saint Mary Overee in Southwark now remaining in its antient state and this circumstance furnishes me with an obvious opportunity of adding an anecdote relating to our poet's munificence and piety which ought not to be omitted Although a poet he largely contributed to rebuild that church in its present elegant form and to render it a beautiful pattern of the lighter Gothic architecture at the same time he founded at his tomb a perpetual chantry  It is on the last of these pieces the CONFESSIO AMANTIS that Gower's character and reputation as a poet are almost entirely founded This poem which bears no immediate reference to the other two divisions is a dialogue between a lover and his confessor who is a priest of Venus and like the mystagogue in the PICTURE of Cebes is called Genius Here as if it had been impossible for a lover not to be a good catholic the ritual of religion is applied to the tender passion and Ovid's Art of Love is blended with the breviary In the course of the confession every evil affection of the human heart which may tend to impede the progress or counteract the success of love is scientifically subdivided and its fatal effects exemplifi  d by a variety of apposite stories extracted  from classics and chronicles The poet often introduces or recapitulates his matter in a few couplets of Latin long and short verses This was in imitation of Boethius  This poem is strongly tinctured with those pedantic affectations concerning the passion of love which the French and Italian poets of the fourteenth century borrowed from the troubadours of Provence and which I have above examined at large But the writer's particular model appears more immediately to have been John of Meun's celebrated ROMAUNT DE LA ROSE He has however seldom attempted to imitate the picturesque imageries and expressive personifications of that exquisite allegory His most striking pourtraits which yet are conceived with no powers of creation nor delineated with any fertility of fancy are IDLENESS AVARICE MICHERIE or Thieving and NEGLIGENCE the  ecretary of SLOTH  Lib iv f a col Lib v f a col Lib iv f a col Lib v f a col  Instead of boldly cloathing these qualities with corporeal attributes aptly and poetically imagined he coldly yet sensibly describes their operations and enumerates their properties What Gower wanted in invention he supplied from his commonplace book which appears to have been stored with an inexhaustible fund of instructive maxims pleasant narrations and philosophical definitions It seems to have been his object to croud all his erudition into this elaborate performance Yet there is often some degree of contrivance and art in his manner of introducing and adapting subjects of a very distant nature and which are totally foreign to his general design  In the fourth book our confessor turns chemist and discoursing at large on the Hermetic science developes its principles and exposes its abuses with great penetration  Lib iv f b col  He delivers the doctrines concerning the vegetable mineral  and animal stones to which Falstaffe alludes in Shakespeare  Fal  taffe mentions a philosopher's or chemist's  two stones  See P Henr iv Act iii Sc Our author abundantly confirms doctor Warburton's explication of this passage which the rest of the commentators do not seem to have understood See Ashm Theatr Chemic p edit Lond to  with amazing accuracy and perspicuity  Ibid f a col  although this doctrine was adopted from systems then in vogue as we shall see below In another place he applies the Argonautic expedition in search of the golden fleece which he relates at length to the same visionary philosophy  Lib v f a seq  Gower very probably conducted his associate Chaucer into these profound mysteries which had been just opened to our countrymen by the books of Roger Bacon  See supr vol p    In the seventh book the whole circle of the Aristotelic philosophy is explained which our lover is desirous to learn supposing that the importance and variety of its speculations might conduce to sooth his anxieties by diverting and engaging his attention Such a discussion was not very likely to afford him much consolation especially as hardly a single ornamental digression is admitted to decorate a field naturally so destitute of flowers Almost the only one is the following description of the chariot and crown of the sun in which the Arabian ideas concerning precious stones are interwoven with Ovid's fictions and the classical mythology  Of goldè glistrende  Glistering  spoke and whele  The Sonne his Carte  Chariot  hath faire and wele  In which he sit and is

weak yet amiable prince his patron king Richard the second on a subject of the most difficult and delicate nature with much freedom and dignity It might also be proved that Gower through this detail of the sciences copied in many other articles the SECRETUM SECRETORUM which is a sort of an abridgement of the Aristotelic philosophy filled with many Arabian innovations and absurdities and enriched with an appendix concerning the choice of wines phlebotomy justice public notaries tournaments and physiognomy rather than from the Latin translations of Aristotle It is evident that he copied from

general view the CONFESSIO AMANTI  may be pronounced to be no unpleasing miscellany of those shorter tales which delighted the readers of the middle age Most of these are now forgotten together with the voluminous chronicles in which they were recorded The book which appears to have accommodated our author with the largest quantity of materials in this article was probably a chronicle entitled PANTHEON or MEMORIAE SECULORUM  compiled in Latin partly in prose and partly in verse by Godfrey of Viterbo a chaplain and notary to three German emperours who died in the year  See sup vol i p Notes h And Jacob Quetif i p  It commences according to the established practice of the historians of this age with the creation of the world and is brought down to the year It was first printed at Basil in the year  In folio Again among Scriptor  de Reb Germanicis by Pistorius Francof fol And Hanov Lastly in a new edit of Pistorius's collection by Struvius Ratisbon fol There is a chronicle I believe sometimes confounded with Godfrey's PANTHEON called the PANTALEONE from the creation to the year about which time it was compiled by the Benedictine monks of Saint Pantaleon at Cologn printed by Eccard with a German translation in the first volume of SCRIPTORES MEDII AEVI p It was continued to the year by Godfridus a Pantaleonist monk This continuation which has conside  able merit as a history is extant in Freherus Rer Germanicar tom i edit Struvian p  The learned Muratori has not scrupled to insert the five last sections of this universal history in the seventh tome of his writers on Italy  P  The subject of this work to use the laborious compiler's own expressions is the whole Old and New Testament and all the emperours and kings which have existed from the beginning of the world to his own times of whom the origin end names and atchievements are commemorated  In proem  The authors which our chronicler professes to have consulted for the gentile story are only Josephus Dion Cassius Strabo Orosius Hegesippus  See supr vol p  Suetonius Solinus and Julius Africanus among which not one of the purer Roman historians occurs Gower also seems to have used another chronicle written by the same Godfrey never printed called SPECULUM REGUM or the MIRROUR OF KINGS which is almost as multifarious as the last containing a genealogy of all the potentates Trojan and German from Noah's flood to the reign of the emperour Henry the sixth according to the chronicles of the venerable Bede Eusebius and Ambrosius  See Lambecc ii p  There are besides two ancient  collectors of marvellous and delectable occurrences to which our author is indebted Cassiodorus and Isidorus These are mentioned as two of the chroniclers which Caxton used in compiling his CRONICLES OF ENGLAND

AETATIBUS IMAGO MUNDI and ABBREVIATIO TEMPORUM It was continued by Isidorus Pacensis from to This continuation was printed in fol Pampelon Under the title  "Epitome Imperatorum vel Arabum Ephemeridos una cum Hispaniae Chronico"  Isidore has likewise left a history or chronicle of the Goths copied also by our author from the year to the death of king Sisebut in the year It was early printed See it in Grotius's COLLECTIO RERUM GOTHICARUM pag Amst vo    These comprehensive systems of all sacred and profane events which in the middle ages multiplied to an excessive degree superseded the use of the classics and other established authors whose materials they gave in a commodious abridgement and in whose place by selecting those stories only which suited the taste of the times they substituted a more agreeable kind of reading nor was it by these means only that they greatly contributed to retard the acquisition of those ornaments  of style and other arts of composition which an attention to the genuine models would have afforded but by being written without any ideas of elegance and in the most barbarous phraseology Yet productive as they were of these and other inconvenient consequences they were not without their use in the rude periods of literature By gradually weaning the minds of readers from monkish legends they introduced a relish for real and rational history and kindling an ardour of inquiring into the transactions of past ages at length awakened a curiosity to obtain a more accurate and authentic knowledge of important events by searching the original authors Nor are they to be entirely neglected in modern and more polished ages For besides that they contain curious pictures of the credulity and ignorance of our ancestors they frequently preserve facts transcribed from books which have not descended to posterity It is extremely probable that the plan on which they are all constructed that of deducing a perpetual history from the creation to the writer's age was partly taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses and partly from the Bible  In the mean time there are three histories of a less general nature which Gower seems more immediately to have followed in some of his tales These are Colonna's Romance of Troy the Romance of Sir Lancelot and the GESTA ROMANORUM  From Colonna's Romance which he calls  The Tale of Troie The Boke of Troie  Of Palamedes and Nauplius  "The  boke of Troie whoso rede"  Lib ii fol b col The story of Jason and Medea  "whereof the tale in speciall is in the  boke of Troie  writte"  Lib v fol  col Of the Syrens seen by Ulysses  "which in

groundwork of the title  In this mixture of moralisation and narrative the GESTA ROMANORUM somewhat resembles the plan of Gower's poem In the rubric of the story of Julius and the poor knight our author alludes to this book in the expression  Hic secundum  GESTA c  Lib viii f a col And in other rubrics In the rubric there is also GESTA ALEXANDRI lib iii f a col And in the story of Sardanapalus  "These olde GESTES tellen us"  lib iii a col  When he speaks of the emperours of Rome paying reverence to a virgin he says he found this custom mentioned  "Of Rome among the GESTES olde  Lib v f a

Antiochus as I have hinted is in the GESTA ROMANORUM although for some parts of it Gower was perhaps indebted to Godfrey's PANTHEON abovementioned  See supr vol i p Notes h  The foundation of Shakespeare's story of the three casketts in the MERCHANT OF VENICE is to be found in this favourite collection this is likewise in our author yet in a different form who cites a  Cronike  He refers

he refers to these  olde bokes  Lib vii f b col c c  for his authority I make no apology for giving the passage somewhat at large as the source of this elegant little  apologue which seems to be of eastern invention has lately so much employed the searches of the commentators on Shakespeare and that the circumstances of the story as it is told by Gower may be compared with those with which it appears in other books  The poet is speaking of a king whose officers and courtiers complained that after a long attendance they had not received adequate rewards and preferments due to their services The king who was no stranger to their complaints artfully contrives a scheme to prove whether this defect proceded from his own want of generosity or their want of discernment  Anone he lette two cofres  Coffers Chests  make  Of one semblance of one make  So lyche  Like  that no life thilke throwe  That one maie fro that other knowe  Thei were into his chambre brought  But no man wote why they be brought  And netheles the kynge hath bede  That thei be sette in privie stede  As he that was of wisdome sligh  Whan he therto his tyme sigh  Saw    All privilyche  Privily  that none it wiste  His

stones mened  he filde also  Thus be thei full both tho  The king assembles his courtiers and shewing them the two chests acquaints them that one of these is filled with gold and jewels that they should chuse which of the two they liked best and that the contents should instantly be distributed among them all A knight by common consent is appointed to chuse for them who fixes upon the chest filled with straw and stones  This kynge then in the same stede  Place    Anone that other cofre undede  Whereas thei sawen grete richesse  Wile more than thei couthen gesse  "Lo saith the kynge now

somewhat similar in which the emperor Frederick places before two beggars two pasties one filled with capons the other with florins ibid b col  "  It must be confessed that there is a much greater and a more beautiful variety of incidents in this story as it is related in the GESTA ROMANORUM which Shakespeare has followed than in Gower and was it not demonstrable that this compilation preceded our author's age by some centuries one would be tempted to conclude that Gower's story was the original fable in its simple unimproved state Whatever was the case it is almost certain that one story produced the other  A translation into English of the GESTA ROMANORUM was printed by Wynkyn de Worde without date In the year one Richard Robinson published  A Record of ancient  Hystoryes  in Latin

first earl of Rivers chiefly with a view of proving its early popularity It is the  Dictes or Sayings of Philosophres  which lord Rivers translated from the French of William de Thignonville provost of the city of Paris about the year entitled  Les dictes moraux des philosophes les dictes des sages et les secrets d' Aristote  See Mem de Litt xvii to  The English translation was printed by Caxton

Squyer  MSS Harl William de Thignonville is here said to have translated this book into French for the use of king Charles the sixth    It is pleasant to observe the strange mistakes which Gower a man of great learning and the most general scholar of his age has committed in this poem concerning books which he never saw his violent anachronisms and misrepresentations of the most common facts and characters He mentions the Greek poet Menander as one of the first historians or  "first enditours of the olde cronike"  together with Esdras Solinus Josephus Claudius Salpicius Termegis Pandulfe Frigidilles Ephiloquorus and Pandas It is extraordinary that Moses should not here be mentioned in preference to Esdras Solinus is ranked so high because he recorded nothing but wonders  Our author

JOSEPHUS  de la  BATTAILLE JUDAIQUE  translaté de Latin en François  printed by Verard at Paris fol I think it is a poem All Josephus's works were printed in the old Latin translation at Verona fol

the fifth century Termegis is probably Trismegistus the mystic philosopher certainly not an historian at least not an antient one Pandulf seems to be Pandulph of Pisa who wrote lives of the popes and died in the year  See the story in our author of pope Boni  ace suppl  nting Celestine  "In a CRONYKE of tyme ago"  Lib ii f a col  Frigidilles is perhaps Fregedaire a Burgundian who flourished about the year and wrote a chronicon from Adam to his own times often printed and containing the best account of the Franks after Gregory of Tours  See Ruinart Dissertat de Fredegario ejusque Operibus tom ii Hist Franc p There is also Fridegodus a  onk of Dover who wrote the lives of some sainted bishops about the year And a Frigeridus  nown only by a reference which Gregory of Tours makes to the  wel  th book of his H  stor    concerning the times preceding Valentinian the third and the capture of Rome by Totila Gregor Turonens Hist  Francor lib ii cap  If this last be the writer in the text a manuscript of Frigeridus's History might have existed in Gower's age which is now lost  Our author who has partly suffered from ignorant transcribers and printers by Ephiloquorus undoubtedly intended Eutropius In the next paragraph indeed he mentions Herodotus  yet not as an early historian but as the first writer of a system of the metrical art  "of metre of ryme and of cadence  Lib vi f b col  "  We smile when Hector in Shakespeare quotes Aristotle but Gower gravely informs his reader that Ulysses was a  clerke  accomplished with a knowledge of all the sciences a great rhetorician and magician that he learned rhetoric of Tully magic of Zoroaster astronomy of Ptolomy philosophy of Plato divination of the prophet Daniel proverbial instruction of Solomon botany of Macer and medicine of Hippocrates  Lib vi f a col  And in the seventh book Aristotle or the  philosophre  is introduced reciting to his scholar Alexander the great a disputation between a Jew and a Pagan who meet between Cairo and Babylon concerning their respective religions the end of the story is to shew the cunning cruelty and ingratitude of the Jew which are at last deservedly punished  Lib vii f b col  But I believe Gower's apology must be that he took this narrative from some christian legend which was feigned for a religious purpose at the expence of all probability and propriety  The only classic Roman writers which our author cites are Virgil Ovid Horace and Tully Among the Italian poets one is surprised he should not quote Petrarch he mentions Dante only who in the rubric is called  "a certain poet of Italy named Dante"  quidam po  ta Italiae qui  DANTE  vocabatur  Lib vii f b col  He appears to have been well acquainted with the Homelies of pope Gregory the great  Prolog f b col Lib v f a col f a col  which were translated into Italian and printed at Milan so early as the year I can hardly decypher and must therefore be excused from transcribing the names of all the renowned authors which our author has quoted in alchemy astrology magic palmistry geomancy and other branches of the occult philosophy  Among the astrological writers he mentions Noah Abraham and Moses But he is not sure that Abraham was an author having never seen any of that patriarch's works and he prefers Trismegistus to Moses  Lib vii f b col vii f b col  Cabalistical tracts were however extant not only under the names of Abraham Noah and Moses but of Adam Abel and Enoch  See supr vol i p p Notes h And Morhof Polyhist tom ii p seq edit  He mentions with particular regard Ptolomy's ALMAGEST the grand source of all the superstitious notions propagated by the Arabian philosophers concerning the science of divination by the stars  Mabillon mentions in a manuscript of the ALMAGEST written before the year a drawing of Ptolomy holding a mirrour not an optical tube in his hand and contemplating the stars Itin Germanic p  These infatuations seem to have completed their triumph over human credulity in Gower's age who probably was an ingenious adept in the false and frivolous speculations of this admired species of study  Gower amidst his graver literature appears to have been a great reader of romances The lover in speaking of the gratification which his passion receives from the sense of hearing says that to hear his lady speak is more delicious than to feast on all the dainties that could be compounded by a cook of Lombardy They are not so restorative  As bin the wordes of hir mouth  For as the wyndes of the South  Ben most of all debonaire  So when hir lust  She chuses  to speak faire  The vertue of her goodly speche  Is verily myne hartes leche  Physician    These are elegant verses To hear her sing is paradise  Then he adds  Full oft tyme it falleth so  My ere  Ear

of IDOYNE and AMADAS is recited as a favourite history among others in the prologue to a collection of legends called CURSOR MUNDI translated from the French  See supr vol p  Notes t  I have already observed our poet's references to Sir LANCELOT'S romance  Our author's account of the progress of the Latin language is extremely curious He supposes that it was invented by the old Tuscan prophetess Carmens that it was reduced to method to composition pronunciation and prosody by the grammarians Aristarchus Donatus and Didymus adorned with the flowers of eloquence and rhetoric by Tully then enriched by translations from the Chaldee Arabic and Greek languages more especially by the version of the Hebrew bible into Latin by saint Jerom in the fourth century and that at length after the labours of many celebrated writers it received its final consummation in Ovid the poet of lovers At the mention of Ovid's name the poet with the dexterity and address of a true master of  transition seizes the critical moment of bringing back the dialogue to its proper argument  Lib iv f b col    The CONFESSIO AMANTIS was most probably written after Chaucer's TROILUS AND CRESSIDA At the close of the poem we are presented with an assemblage of the most illustrious lovers  Lib viii f a col  Together with the renowned heroes and heroines of love mentioned either in romantic or classical history we have David and Bathsheba Sampson and Dalila and Solomon with all  is concubines Virgil also Socrates Plato and Ovid are enumerated as lovers Nor must we be surprised to find Aristotle honoured with a place in this gallant groupe for whom says the poet the queen of Greece made such a syllogism as destroyed all his logic But among the rest Troilus and Cressida are introduced seemingly with an intention of paying a compliment to Chaucer's poem on their story which had been submitted to Gower's correction  Chaucer's Tr Cress  Urr edit p  Although this famous pair had been also recently celebrated in Boccacio's FILOSTRATO  See supr vol i p  And in another place speaking of his absolute devotion to his lady's will he declares himself ready to acquiesce in her choice whatsoever she shall command whether if when tired of dancing and caroling she should chuse to play at chess or read TROILUS AND CRESSIDA This is certainly Chaucer's poem  That when her li  t on nights wake  In chambre as to carol and daunce  Methinke I maie me more avaunce  If I may gone upon hir honde  Than if I wynne a kynges londe  For whan I maie her hand beclip  Clasp    With such gladness I daunce and

dyes to cast a chaunce  Or aske of love some demaunde  Or els that her list commaunde  To rede and here of TROILUS  Lib iv    b col    That this poem was written after Chaucer's FLOURE AND LEAFE may be partly collected from the following passage which appears to be an imitation of Chaucer and is no bad specimen of Gower's most poetical manner Rosiphele a beautiful princess but setting love at defiance the daughter of Herupus king of Armenia is taught obedience to the laws of Cupid by seeing a vision of Ladies  Whan come was the moneth of Maie  She wolde walke upon a daie  And that was er the son arist  Arose    Of women but a fewe it wist  "But a few of her women knew of this"    And forth she went prively  Unto a parke was faste by  All softe walkende on the gras  Tyll she came there  There  where  the launde was  Through which ran a great rivere  It thought her fayre and said here  I will abide under the shawe  And bad hir women to withdrawe  And ther she stood alone stille  To thinke what was in her wille  She sighe  Saw  the swete floures sprynge  She herde glad fowles synge  She sigh beastes in her kynde  The buck the doo the hert the hynde  The males go with the femele  And so began there a quarele  Dispute  Betwene love and her owne herte  Fro whiche she couthe not asterte  And as she cast hir eie aboute  She sigh clad in one suit a route  Of ladies where thei comen ride  Alonge under the wooddè side  On fayre  Ambling  ambulende hors thei set  That were al whyte fayre and gret  And everichone ride on side  A mark of high rank    The sadels were of such a pride  So riche sighe she never none  With perles and golde so wel begone  In kirtels and in copes riche  Thei were clothed all aliche  Alike    Departed even of white and blewe  With all lustes  Lists

For pure abasshe drewe hir adrigh  And helde hir close undir the bough  At length she sees riding in the rear of this splendid troop on a horse lean galled and lame a beautiful lady in a tattered garment her saddle mean and much worn but her bridle richly studded with gold and jewels and round her waist were more than an hundred halters The princess asks the meaning of this strange procession and is answered by the lady on the lean horse that these are spectres of ladies who when living were obedient and faithful votaries of love  "As to myself she adds I am now receiving my annual penance for being a rebel to love"  For I whilom no love had  My horse is now feble and badde  And al to torn is myn araie  And everie year this freshe Mai  These lustie ladies ride aboute  And I must nedes

inconsistent with the rest of her furniture her dress and horse The lady answers that it was a badge and reward for having loved a knight faithfully for the last fortnight of her life  "Now have ye herde all mine answere  "To god madam I you betake  "And warneth all for my sake  "Of love that thei be not idell  "And bid hem thinke of my bridell"  And with that worde all sodenly  She passeth as it were a skie  A shadow    umbra    All clean out of the ladies sight  Lib iv f seq    My readers will easily conjecture the change which this spectacle must naturally produce in the obdurate heart of the princess of Armenia There is a farther proof that the FLOURE AND LEAFE preceded the CONFESSIO AMANTIS In the eighth book our author's lovers are crowned with the Flower and Leaf  Myn eie I

I believe on the whole that Chaucer had published most of his poems before this piece of Gower appeared Chaucer had not however at this time written his TESTAMENT OF LOVE for Gower in a sort of Epilogue to the CONFESSIO AMANTIS is addressed by Venus who commands him to greet Chaucer as her favourite poet and disciple as one who had employed his youth in composing songs and ditties to her honour She adds at the close  For thy now in his  daies olde  Thou shalt hym tell this message  That he upon his  later  age  To sette  an ende  of all his werke  As he which is myne owne clerke  Do make his TESTAMENT OF LOVE  As thou hast done thy SHRIFTE above  So that my court it maie recorde  Lib viii f b col    Chaucer at this time was sixtyfive years of age The Court of Love one of the pedantries of French gallantry occurs often In an address to Venus  "Madame I am a man of thyne that in thy COURTE hath served long  Lib i f b col  "  The lover observes that for want of patience a man ought  "amonge the women alle in LOVES COURTE by  judgement  the name beare of paciant  Lib iii f a col  "  The confessor declares that many persons are condemned for disclosing secrets  "In LOVES

own poem now before us the Lover's CONFESSION  There are also many manifest evidences which lead us to conclude that this poem preceded Chaucer's CANTERBURY'S TALES undoubtedly some of that poet's latest compositions and probably not begun till after the year The MAN OF LAWES TALE is circumstantially borrowed from Gower's CONSTANTIA  Conf Amant Lib ii f b col See particularly ibid f b col a col And compare Ch MAN OF L T v  "Some men wold sayn c"  That is GOWER  and Chaucer in that TALE apparently censures Gower for his manner of relating the stories of Canace and Apollonius in the third and

antient Greek Latin Saxon barbarous Greek and old French was at length translated from French into English and printed in the black letter by Wynkyn de Worde A D to  "Kynge Appolyn of Thyre"  See supr vol i p A copy is in my possession  The WIFE OF BATHES TALE is founded  on Gower's Florent a knight of Rome who delivers the king of Sicily's daughter from the incantations of her stepmother  Lib i f b col  Although the GESTA ROMANORUM might have furnished both poets with this narrative Chaucer however among other great improvements has judiciously departed from the fable in converting Sicily into the more popular court of king Arthur  Perhaps in estimating Gower's merit I have pushed the notion too far that because he shews so much learning he had no great share of natural abilities But it should be considered that when books began to grow fashionable and the reputation of learning conferred the highest honour poets became ambitious of being thought scholars and sacrificed their native powers of invention to the ostentation of displaying an extensive course of reading an  to the pride of profound erudition On this account the minstrels of these times who were totally uneducated and poured forth spontaneous rhymes in obedience to the workings of nature often exhibit more genuine strokes of passion and imagination than the professed poets Chaucer is an exception to this observation whose original feelings were too strong to be suppressed by books and whose learning was overbalanced by genius  This affectation of appearing learned which yet was natural at the revival of literature in our old poets even in those who were altogether destitute of talents has lost to posterity many a curious picture of manners and many a romantic image Some of our antient bards however aimed at no other merit than that of being able to versify and attempted nothing more than to cloath in rhyme those sentiments which would have appeared with equal propriety in prose  SECT II  ONE of the reasons which rendered the classic authors of the lower empire more popular than those of a purer age was because they were christians Among these no Roman writer appears to have been more studied and esteemed from the beginning to the close of the barbarous centuries than Boethius Yet it is certain that his allegorical personifications and his visionary philosophy founded on the abstractions of the Platonic school greatly concurred to make him a favourite  It is observable that this SPIRIT OF PERSONIFICATION tinctures the writings of some of the christian fathers about or rather before this period Most of the agents in the SHEPHERD of HERMAS are  ideal  beings An ancient lady converses with Hermas and tells him that she is the CHURCH OF GOD Afterwards several virgins appear and discourse with him and when he desires to be informed who they are he is told by the SHEPHERDANGEL that they are FAITH ABSTINENCE PATIENCE CHASTITY CONCORD c Saint Cyprian relates that the

Sirmond And by John of Salisbury for his eloquence and argument Policrat vii And by many other writers of the same class  It has had many imitators Eccard a learned French Benedictine wrote in

Cant xxx  Leland who lived when true literature began to be restored says that the writings of Boethius still continued to retain that high estimation which they had acquired in the most early periods I had almost forgot to observe that the CONSOLATION was translated into Greek by Maximus Planudes the most learned and ingenious of the Constantinopolitan monks  Montfauc Bibl Coislin p Of a Hebrew

was a singular promoter of literature and however unqualified for political intrigues the common patron of the scholars of the times A sketch of his character in that view is therefore too closely connected with our subject to be censured as an unnecessary digression About the year he gave to the university of Oxford a library containing six hundred volumes only one hundred and twenty of which

estimation and which his liberal and judicious attention greatly contributed to restore  I close this section with an apology for Chaucer Gower and Occleve who are supposed by the severe  etymologists to have corrupted the purity of the English language by affecting to introduce so many foreign words and phrases But if we attend only to the politics of the times we shall find these poets as also some of their successors much less blameable in this respect than the critics imagine Our wars with France which began in the reign of Edward the third were of long continuance The principal nobility of England at this period resided in France with their families for many years John king of France kept his court in England  o which exclusive of these French lords who were his fellowprisoners or necessary attendants the chief nobles of his kingdom must have occasionally resorted Edward the black prince made an expedition into Spain John of Gaunt duke of Lancaster and his brother the duke of York were matched with the daughters of Don Pedro king of Castile All these circumstances must have concurred to produce a perceptible change in the language of the court It is rational therefore and it is equitable to suppose that instead of coining new words they only complied with the common and fashionable modes of speech Would Chaucer's poems have been the delight of those courts in which he lived had they been filled with unintelligible pedantries The cotemporaries of these poets never complained of their obscurity But whether defensible on these principles or not they much improved the vernacular style by the use of this exotic phraseology It was thus that our primitive diction was enlarged and enriched The English language owes its copiousness elegance and harmony to these innovations  SECT III  I Consider Chaucer as a genial day in an English spring A brilliant sun enlivens the face of nature with an unusual lustre the sudden appearance of cloudless skies and the unexpected warmth of a tepid atmosphere after the gloom and the inclemencies of a tedious winter fill our hearts with the visionary prospect of a speedy summer and we fondly anticipate a long continuance of gentle gales and vernal serenity But winter returns with redoubled horrors the clouds condense more formidably than before and those tender buds and early blossoms which were called forth by the transient gleam of a temporary sunshine are nipped by frosts and torn by tempests  Most of the poets that immediately succeeded Chaucer seem rather relapsing into barbarism than availing themselves of those striking ornaments which his judgment and imagination had disclosed They appear to have been insensible to his vigour of versification and his flights of fancy It was not indeed likely that a poet should soon arise equal to Chaucer and it must be remembered that the national distractions which ensued had no small share in obstructing the exercise of those studies which delight in peace and repose His successors however approach him in no degree of proportion Among these John Lydgate is the poet who follows him at the shortest interval  I have placed Lydgate in the reign of Henry the sixth and he seems to have arrived at his highest point of eminence about the year  In a copy of Lydgate's  Chronicle of English Kings  there is a stanza of Edward the fourth MSS Harl In his poem  Ab inimicis nostris  c Edward the fourth his  Quene  and  Modir  are remembered MSS Harl ibid fol But these pieces could not well be written by Lydgate For he was ordained a subdeacon Deacon And priest Registr Gul Cratfield abbatis de Bury MSS Cott TIBER B ix fol Edward came to the crown Pitts says that our author died Lydgate in his PHILOMELA mentions the death of Henry lord Warwick who died in MSS Harl ibid fol  Many of his poems however  appeared before He was a monk of the Benedictine abbey of Bury in Suffolk and an uncommon ornament of his profession Yet his genius was so lively and his accomplishments so numerous that I suspect the holy father saint Benedict would hardly have acknowledged him for a genuine disciple After a short education at Oxford he travelled into France and Italy  See one of his DITTIES MSS Harl fol  I have been offte in dyvers londys c  and returned a complete master of the language and the literature of both countries He chiefly studied the Italian and French poets particularly Dante Boccacio and Alain Chartier and became so distinguished a proficient in polite learning that he opened a school in his monastery for teaching the sons of the nobility the arts of versification and the elegancies of composition Yet although philology was his object he was not unfamiliar with the fashionable philosophy he was not only a poet and a rhetorician but a geometrician an astronomer a theologist and a disputant On the whole I am of opinion that Lydgate made considerable additions to those amplifications of our language in which Chaucer Gower and Occleve led the way and that he is the first of our writers whose style is cloathed with that perspicuity in which the English phraseology appears at this day to an English reader  To enumerate Lydgate's pieces would be to write the catalogue of a little library No poet seems to have possessed a greater versatility of talents He moves with equal ease in every mode of composition His hymns and his ballads have the same degree of merit and whether his subject be the life of a hermit or a hero of saint Austin or Guy earl of Warwick ludicrous or legendary religious or romantic a  history or an allegory he writes with facility His transitions were rapid from works of the most serious and laborious kind to sallies of levity and pieces of popular entertainment His muse was of universal access and he was not only the poet of his monastery but of the world in general If a disguising was intended by the company of goldsmiths a mask before his majesty at Eltham a maygame for the sheriffs and aldermen of London a mumming before the lord mayor a procession of pageants from the creation for the festival of Corpus Christi or a carol for the coronation Lydgate was consulted and gave the poetry  See a variety of his pieces of this kind MSS Ashmol ii Stowe says that at the reception of Margaret queen of Henry sixth several pageaunts the verses by Lydgate were shewn at Paul's gate in Hist p See also MSS Harl fol b The COVENTRY PLAY for Corpus Christi day in the Cotton library was very probably written by our author VESPAS D viii fol    About the year Whethamstede the learned and liberal abbot of saint Albans being desirous of familiarising the history of his patron saint to the monks of his convent employed Lydgate as it should seem then a monk of Bury to translate the Latin legend of his life in English rhymes The chronicler who records a part of this anecdote seems to consider Lydgate's translation as a matter of mere manual mechanism for he adds that Whethamstede paid for the translation the writing and illuminations one hundred shillings It was placed before the altar of the saint which Whethamstede afterwards adorned with much magnificence in the abbey church  GEST Joh Whethamst ut supr p cxvi cxxvii cxxiv It is added that Whethamstede expended on the binding and other exterior ornaments of the manuscript upwards of three pounds Bal  and Pitts say that Whethamstede himself made the translation p It is in Trinity college at Oxford MSS And in Lincoln cathedral MSS I Among Lydgate's works is recited  Vita S Albani Martyris ad  JOH FRUMENTARIUM Whethamstede  abbatem    Our author's stanzas called the DANCE OF DEATH which he translated from the French at the request of the chapter of saint Paul's to be inscribed under the representation of DEATH leading all ranks of men about the cloister of their  church in a curious series of paintings are well known But their history has not I believe yet

VISIONS written about  DEATH came driving after and al to dust pashed  K  NGS and KAISA  S KNIGHTS and POPES  were originally written by one Macaber in German rhymes and were translated into Latin

Zamorensis and printed at Hanau in the year  In to  But a French translation was made much earlier than the Latin and written about the walls of saint Innocents cloister at Paris from which Lydgate formed his English version  See the DAUNCE OF MACABRE MSS Harl fol And OBSERVATIONS on the FAIRY QUEEN vol ii p  eq The DANCE OF DEATH falsly supposed to have been invented by Holbein is different from this though founded in the same idea It was painted by Holbein in the Augustine monastery at Basil But it appeared much earlier In the chronicle of Hartmannus Schedelius Norimb fol In the

manuscript on vellum undoubtedly a present to king Henry the sixth  MSS Harl to  It contains a set of Lydgate's poems in honour of saint Edmund the patron of his monastery at Bury Besides the decoration of illuminated initials and one hundred and twenty pictures of various sizes representing the incidents related in the poetry executed with the most delicate pencil and exhibiting the habits weapons architecture  utensils and many other curious particulars belonging to the age of the ingenious illuminator there are two exquisite portraits of the king one of William Curteis abbot of Bury and one of the poet Lydgate kneeling at saint Edmund's shrine  There is an antient drawing probably coeval of Lydgate presenting his poem called the PILGRIM to the earl of Salisbury MSS Harl It was written Another of these drawings will be mentioned below  In one of the king's pictures he is represented on his throne crowned and receiving this volume from the abbot kneeling in another he appears as a child prostrate on a carpet at saint Edmund's shrine which is richly delineat  d yet without any idea of perspective or proportion The figures of a great number of monks and attendants are introduced Among the rest two noblemen perhaps the king's uncles with bonnets or caps of an uncommon shape It appears that our pious monarch kept his Christmas at this magnificent monastery and that he remained here in a state of seclusion from the world and of an exemption from public cares till the following Easter and that at his departure he was created a brother of the chapter  Fol  It is highly probable that this sumptuous book the poetry of which was undertaken by Lydgate at the command of abbot Curteis  Cu  t  is was abbot of Bury between the years and It appears that Lydgate was

reason he is often tedious and languid His chief excellence is in description especially where the subject admits a flowery diction He is seldom pathetic or animated  In another part of this poem

so little discrimination should have been made between sacred and profane characters and incidents But the common sense of mankind had not yet attained a just estimate of things Lydgate in another piece has versified the rubrics of the missal which he applies to the god Cupid and declares with how much delight he frequently meditated on the holy legend of those constant martyrs who were not afraid to suffer death for the faith of that omnipotent divinity  MSS Fairfax xvi Bibl Bodl  There are instances in which religion was even made the instrument of love Arnaud Daniel a celebrated troubadour of the thirteenth century in a fit of amorous despair promises to found a multitude of annual masses and to dedicate perpetual tapers to the shrines of saints for the important purpose of obtaining the affections of an obdurate mistress  SECT IV  BUT Lydgate's principal poems are the FALL OF PRINCES the SIEGE OF THEBES and the DESTRUCTION OF TROY Of all these I shall speak distinctly  About the year Boccacio wrote a Latin history in ten books entitled DE CASIBUS VIRORUM ET FEMINARUM ILLUSTRIUM Like other chronicles of the times it commences with Adam and is brought down to the author'  age Its last grand event is John king of France taken prisoner by the English at the battle of Poitiers in the year  Printed at Ausbourg And at Paris fol It is amazing that Vossius should not know the number of books of which this work consisted and that it was ever printed De Hist Lat lib iii cap ii It was translated into Italian by Betussi in Firenza vo volum  This book of Boccacio was soon afterwards translated into French by one of whom little more seems to be known than that he was named Laurence yet so paraphrastically and with so many considerable additions a  almost to be rendered a new work  In Lydgate's PROLOGUE B i fol i a col edit ut infr  He that sumtime did his diligence  The boke of Bochas  in French to translate  Out of Latin  he called was LAURENCE  He says

unma    c And that old authors may be rendered more agreeable by b  ing cloathed in new ornaments of language and improved with new inventions Ibid a col He adds that it was Laurence's design in his translation into French to  amende co  rect  and declare  and not to spare thinges touched shortly  Ibid col Afterwards he calls him this  noble translatour  Ibid b col In another place where a

French antiquaries as one of Laurence's translations Lydgate in the Prologue abovecited observes that Laurence who in  unyng did excel  undertook this translation at the request of some eminent personages in France who had the interest of  rhetorike  at heart Ut supr a col  Caxton's TULLIUS OF OLD AGE or DE SENECTUTE printed in is translated from Laurence's French version Caxton in the postscript calls him  Laurence de primo facto  Lydgate's poem consists of nine books and is thus entitled in the earliest edition  "The TRAGEDIES gathered by Jhon BOCHAS of all such princes as fell

most authentic manuscript of this piece is in the British Museum probably written under the inspection of the author and perhaps intended as a present to Humphrey duke of Glocester at whose gracious command the poem as I have before hinted was undertaken It contains among  numerous miniatures illustrating the several histories portraits of Lydgate and of another monk habited in black perhaps an abbot of Bury kneeling before a prince who seems to be saint Edmund seated on a throne under a canopy and grasping an arrow  MSS Harl fol    The work is not improperly styled a set of tragedies It is not merely a narrative of men eminent for their rank and misfortunes The plan is perfectly dramatic and partly suggested by the pageants of the times Every personage is supposed to appear before the poet and to relate his respective sufferings and the figures of these spectres are sometimes finely drawn Hence a source is opened for moving compassion and for a display of imagination In some of the lives the author replies to the speaker and a sort of dialogue is introduced for conducting the story Brunchild a queen of France who murthered all her children and was afterwards hewn in pieces

has so powerful and universal an influence in human affairs and especially in effecting those vicissitudes which are the subject of this work There is a Gothic greatness in her figure with some touches of the grotesque An attribute of the early poetry of all nations before ideas of selection have taken place I must add that it was Boethius's admired allegory on the CONSOLATION OF PHILOSOPHY

Leander in his ITALIA calls this Andalus  Andalotius niger curiosus astrologus  See Papyrius Mass Elog tom ii p    Lydgate appears to have been far advanced in years when he finished this poem for at the beginning of the eighth book he complains of his trembling joints and declares that age having benumbed his faculties has deprived him  "of all the subtylte of curious makyng in Englysshe to endyte  B vii Prol fol i b col ad calc He calls himself older than sixty years  "  Our author in the structure and modulation of his style seems to have been ambitious of rivalling Chaucer  Prol B i f ii a col seq  whose capital compositions he enumerates and on whose poetry he bestows repeated encomiums  I cannot quit this work without adding an observation relating to Boccacio its original author which perhaps may deserve attention It is highly probable that Boccacio learned many anecdotes of Grecian history and Grecian fable not to be found in any Greek writer now extant from his preceptors Barlaam Leontius and others who had lived at Constantinople while the Greek literature was yet flourishing Some of these are perhaps scattered up and down in the composition before us which contains a considerable part of the Grecian story and especially in his treatise of the genealogies of the gods  In fifteen books First printed in fol And in Italian by Betussi Venet In French at Paris fol In the interpretation of the fables he is very prolix and jejune  Boccacio himself calls his master Leontius an inexhaustible archive of Grecian tales and fables although not equally conversant with those of  the Latins  GENEAL DEOR lib xv cap vi  He confesses that he took many things in his book of the genealogies of the gods from a vast work entitled COLLECTIVUM now lost written by his cotemporary Paulus Peru  inus the materials of which had in great measure been furnished by Barlaam  "Quicquid apud Graecos inveniri potest ADJUTORIO BARLAAE arbitror collegisse"  GENEAL DEOR lib xv cap vi  We are informed also that Perusinus made use of some of these fugitive Greek scholars especially Barlaam for collecting rare books in that language Perusinus was librarian about the year to Robert king of Jerusalem and Sicily and was the most curious and inquisitive man of his age for searching after unknown or uncommon manuscripts especially histories and poetical compositions and particularly such as were written in Greek I will beg leave to cite the words of Boccacio who records this anecdote  "Et si usquam CURIOSISSIMUS  uit homo in perquirendis jussu etiam principis PEREGRINIS undecunque libris HISTORIIS et POETICIS operibus iste fuit Et ob id singulari amicitiae Barlaae conjunctus quae a Latinis habere non poterat EO MEDIO INNUMERA exhausit a GRAECIS  GENEAL DEOR lib xv cap vi  "  By these HISTORIAE and POETICA OPERA brought from Constantinople by Barlaam undoubtedly works of entertainment and perhaps chiefly of the romantic and fictitious species I do not understand the classics It is natural to suppose that Boccacio both from his connections and his curiosity was no stranger to these treasures and that many of these pieces thus imported into Italy by the dispersion of the Constantinopolitan exiles are only known at present through the medium of his writings It is certain that many oriental fictions found their way into Europe by means of this communication  Lydgate's STORIE OF THEBES was first printed by William Thinne at the end of his edition of Chaucer's works in  The author introduces it as an additional Canterbury tale After a severe

conception of the attendance of this allegorical groupe on these incestuous espousals is highly poetical and although some of the personifications are not presented with the addition of any picturesque attributes yet others are marked with the powerful pencil of Chaucer  This poem is the THEBAID of a troubadour The old classical tale of Thebes is here cloathed with feudal manners

observing that discord received its origin in hell and that the first battle ever fought was that of Lucifer and his legion of rebel angels  Pag col  But that the argument may have the fullest confirmation Saint Luke is then quoted to prove that avarice ambition and envy are the primary sources of contention and that Christ came into the world to destroy these malignant principles and to propagate universal charity  At the close of the poem the mediation of the holy virgin is invoked to procure peace in this life and salvation in the next Yet it should be remembered that this piece is written by a monk and addressed to pilgrims  Lydgate was near fifty when this poem was written pag col    SECT V  THE third of Lydgate's poems which I proposed to consider is the TROY BOKE or the

poem elegantly illuminated with the picture of a monk presenting a book to a king  MSS Digb  From the splendour of the decorations it appears to be the copy which Lydgate gave to Henry the fifth  This poem is professedly a translation or paraphrase of Guido de Colonna's romance entitled HISTORIA TROJANA  Princip  "Licet cotidie vetera recentioribus obruantur"  But whether from Colonna's original Latin or from a French version  Of a Spanish version by Petro Nunez Degaldo see Nic Anton Bibl Hispan tom ii p  mentioned in Lygdate's Prologue and which existed soon after the year I cannot ascertain

from Dares Phrygius and Dictys Cretensis  As Colonna's book is extremely scarce and the subject interesting I will translate a few lines f  om Colonna's Prologue and Postscript From the Prologue  "These things originally written by the Grecian D  ctys and the Phrygian Dares who were present in the Trojan war and faithful relators of what they saw are transferred into this book by Guido of Colonna a judgeAnd although a certain Roman Cornelius by name the nephew of the great Sallustius translated Dares and Dictys into Latin yet attempting to be concise he has very improperly omitted those particulars of the history which would have proved most agreeable to the reader In my own book therefore every article belonging to the Trojan story will be comprehended"  And in his Postscript  "And I Guido de Colonna have followed the said Dictys in every particular for this reason because Dictys made his work perfect and complete in every thingAnd I should have decorated this history with more m  taphors and ornaments of style and by incidental digressions which are the  pictures  of composition But deterred by the difficulty of the work c"  Guido has indeed ma  e Dictys nothing more than the groundwork of his story All this is translated in Lydgate's Prologue  who perpetually occur as authorities in Lydgate's translation Homer is however referred to in this work particularly in

of illumining I do not however suppose that Colonna who flourished in the middle of the thirteenth century had ever seen Homer's poems he might have known these and many other particulars contained in the Iliad from those factitious historian  whom he professes to follow Yet it is not in the mean time impossible that Lydgate might have seen the Iliad at least in a Latin translation Leontius Pilatus already mentioned one of the learned Constantinopolitan exiles had translated the Iliad into Latin prose with part of the Odyss  y at the desire of Boccacio  It is a slight error in Vigneul Marville

and the mountain of Circe In another part of these letters he acknowledges the receipt of the Latin Homer and mentions with how much satisfaction and joy the report of its arrival in the public

translations although he had travelled in France and Italy One may venture to pronounce peremptorily that he did not understand as he probably never had seen the original After the migration of the

are innumerable for the Trojan story and with no great difficulty is here entirely accommodated to the ideas of romance Hardly any adventure of the champions of the round table  was more chimerical and unmeaning than this of our Grecian chiefs and the cause of their expedition to Troy was quite in the spirit of chivalry as it was occasioned by a lady When Jason arrives at Cholcos he is entertained by king Oetes in a Gothic castle Amadis or Lancelot were never conducted to their fairy chambers with more ceremony and solemnity He is led through many a hall and many a tower by many a

of war All the military machines invented and used in the crusades are assembled to demolish the bulwarks of that city with the addition of great guns Among other implements of destruction borrowed from the holy war the Greek fire first discovered at Constantinople with which the Saracens so greatly annoyed the Christian armies is thrown from the walls of the besieged  B ii c xviii See supr vol i p In Caxton's TROYBOOK Hercules is said to make the  fire artificiall  as well as Cacus c ii    Nor are we only presented in this piece with the habits of feudal life and the practices of chivalry The poem is enriched with a multitude of oriental fictions and Arabian traditions Medea gives to Jason when he is going to combat the brazen bulls and to lull the dragon who guarded the golden fleece asleep a marvellous ring in which was a gem whose virtue could destroy the efficacy of poison and render the wearer invisible It was the same sort of precious stone adds our author which Virgil celebrates and which Venus sent her son Eneas that he might enter Carthage unseen Another of Medea's presents to Jason to assist him in this perilous atchievement is a silver image or talisman which defeated all the powers of incantation and was framed according to principles of astronomy  Ibid  The hall of king Priam is illuminated at night by a prodigious carbuncle placed among saphires rubies and pearls on the crown of a golden statue of Jupiter fifteen cubits high  B ii c xi  In the court of the palace was a tree made by magic whose trunk was twelve cubits high the branches which overshadowed distant plains were alternately of solid gold and silver blossomed with gems of various hues which were renewed every day  B ii c xi  Most of these extravagancies and a thousand more are in Guido de Colonna who lived when this mode of fabling was at its height But in the fourth book Dares  e  Phrigius is particularly cited for a description of Priam's palace which seemed to be founded by FAYRIE or enchantment and was paved with crystal built of diamonds saphires and emeralds and supported by ivory pillars surmounted with golden images  Cap xxvi  This is not however in Dares The warriors who came to the assistance of the Trojans afford an ample field for invention One of them be  ongs to a region of forests amid the gloom of which wander many monstrous beasts not real but

before been falsified by Dictys and Dares but those writers misrepresenting or enlarging Homer only invented plain and credible facts They were the basis of Colonna who first filled the faint outlines of their fabulous history with the colourings of eastern fancy and adorned their scanty forgeries with the gorgeous trappings of Gothic chivalry Or as our author expresses himself in his Prologue speaking of Colonna's improvements on his originals  For he ENLUMINETH by crafte and cadence  This noble story with many a FRESHE COLOURE  Of rhetorike and many a RYCHE FLOURE  Of eloquence to make it sound the bett  Better    Cloathed with these new inventions this favourite tale descended to later times Yet it appears not only with these but with an infinite variety of other embellishments not fabricated by the fertile genius of Colonna but  adopted from French enlargements of Colonna and incorporated from romances on other subjects in the French RECUYEL OF TROY written by a French ecclesiastic Rauol le Feure about the year and translated by Caxton  As for instance Hercules having killed the eleven giants of Cremona builds over them a vast tower on which he placed eleven images of metal of the size and figure of the giants B ii c Something like this I think is in Amadis de Gaul Robert Braham in the EPISTLE TO THE READER prefixed to the edition of Lydgate's TROYBOOK of is of opinion that the fables in the French RECUYEL ought to be ranked with the  trifeling tales  and  bar  ay  e lu  rdries  of ROBYN HODE and BEVYS OF HAMPTON and are not to be compared with the  faythful  and  trewe  reports of this history given by Dares Phrigius and Dictys Cretensis    The description of the city of Troy as newly built by king Priam is extremely curious not for the capricious incredibilities and absurd inconsistencies which it exhibits  It is three days journey in length and breadth The walls are two hundred cubits high of marble and alabaster and machiocolated At every angle was a crown of gold set with the riche  t gems There were great guns in the towers On each turret were figures of savage and monstrous beasts in brass The gates were of brass and each has a portcullis The houses were all uniform and of marble sixty cubits high  but because it conveys anecdotes of antient architecture and especially of that florid and improved species which began to grow fashionable in Lydgate's age Although much of this is in Colonna He avoids to describe it geometrically having never read Euclid He says that Priam procured  Eche carver and curious joyner  To make knottes with many a queint floure  To sette on crestes within and eke without  That he sent for such as could  "grave groupe or carve were sotyll in their fantasye good devysours marveylous of

last word Perhaps it is a sort of ornamented armour for the legs    The account of the Trojan theatre must not be omitted as it displays the imperfect ideas of the stage at least of dramatic exhibition which now prevailed or rather the absolute inexistence of this sort of spectacle Our author supposes that comedies and tragedies were first represented at Troy  All that follows on this subject is not in Colonna  He defines a comedy to begin with complaint and to end with  gladnesse  expressing the actions of those only who live in the lowest condition But tragedy he informs us begins in prosperity and ends in adversity shewing the wonderful vicissitudes of fortune which have happened in the lives of kings and mighty conquerours In the theatre of Troy he adds was a pulpit in which stood a poet who rehearsed the  noble dedes that were historial of kynges prynces and worthy emperours  and above all related those fatal and sudden catastrophes which they sometimes suffered by murther poison conspiracy or other secret and unforeseen machinations  And this was tolde and redde by the poete  And while that he in the pulpet stode  With deadlye facè all devoyd of blode  Syngynge his dites with tresses al to rent  Amydde the theatre shrowded in a tent  There came out men gastfull of their cheres  Disfygured their faces with vyseres  Playing by signès in the people's syght  That the poete songe hathe on height  "That which the poet sung standing in the pulpit"    So that there was no maner discourdaunce  Atween his ditees and their countenaunce  For lyke as he aloftè dyd expresse  Wordes of joyè or of hevinesse  So craftely they  The actors  could them  Themselves  transfygure  Lib ii cap x See also B iii c xxviii    It is added that these plays or  rytes of tragedyes old  were acted at Troy and  in the theatre halowed and yholde  when the months of April and May returned  In this detail of the dramatic exhibition which prevailed in the ideal theatre of Troy a poet placed on the stage in a pulpit and characteristically habited is said to have recited a series of tragical adventures whose pathetic narrative was afterwards expressed by the dumb gesticulations of a set of masqued actors Some perhaps may be inclined to think that this imperfect species of theatric representation was the rude drama of Lydgate's age But surely Lydgate would not have described at all much less in a long and laboured digression a public shew which from its nature was familiar and notorious On the contrary he describes it as a thing obsolete and existing only in remote times Had a more perfect and legitimate stage now subsisted he would not have deviated from his subject to communicate unnecessary information and to deliver such minute definitions of tragedy and comedy On the whole this formal history of a theatre conveys nothing more than an affected display of Lydgate's learning and is collected yet with apparent inaccuracy and confusion of circumstances from what the antient grammarians have left concerning the origin of the Greek tragedy  Or perhaps it might be borrowed by our author from some French paraphrastic version of Colonna's Latin romance  Among the antient authors beside those already mentioned cited in this poem are Lollius for the history of Troy Ovid for the tale of Medea and Jason Ulysses and Polyphemus the Myrmidons and other stories Statius for Polynices and Eteocles the venerable Bede Fulgentius the mythologist Justinian with whose institutes Colonna as a civilian must have been well acquainted Pliny and Jacobus de Vitriaco The last is produced to prove that Philometer a famous philosopher invented the game of chess to divert a tyrant from his cruel purposes in Chaldea and that from thence it was imported into Greece But Colonna or rather Lydgate is of a different opinion and contends in opposition to his authority that this game  so sotyll and so marvaylous  was discovered by  prudent clerkes  during the siege of Troy and first practiced in that city  y  Colonna calls him  ille  FABULARIUS  Sulmonensisfabulose commentans  c Signat b  Jacobus de Vitriaco was a canon regular at Paris and among other dignities in the church bishop of Ptolemais in Palestine about the year This tradition of the invention of chess is mentioned by Jacobus de Vitriaco in his ORIENTAL AND OCCIDENTAL HISTORY  In three books  The anecdote of Philometer is I think in Egidius Romanus on this subject abovementioned Chaucer calls Athalus that is Attalus Philometer the same person and who is often mentioned in Pliny the invento  of chess  DREME p col edit Urr    I must not pass over an instance of Lydgate's gallantry as it is the gallantry of a monk Colonna takes all opportunities of satirising the fair sex and Lydgate with great politeness declares himself absolutely unwilling to translate those passages of this severe moralist which contain such unjust and illiberal misrepresentations of the female character Instead of which to obviate these injurious reflections our translator enters upon a formal vindication of  the ladies not by a panegyric on their beauty nor encomiums on those amiable accomplishments by which they refine our sensibilities and give elegance to life but by a display of that religious fortitude with which some women have suffered martyrdom or of that inflexible chastity by means of which others have been snatched up alive into heaven in a state of genuine virginity Among other striking examples which the calendar affords he mentions the transcendent grace of the eleven thousand virgins who were martyred at Cologne in Germany In the mean time female saints as I suspect in the barbarous ages were regarded with a greater degree of respect on account of those exaggerated ideas of gallantry which chivalry inspired and it is not improbable that the distinguished honours paid to the virgin Mary might have partly proceeded from this principle  Among the anachronistic improprieties which this poem contains some of which have been pointed out the most conspicuous is the fiction of Hector's sepulchre or tomb which also merits our attention for another reason as it affords us an opportunity of adding some other notices of the modes of antient architecture to those already mentioned The poet from Colonna supposes that Hector was buried in the principal church of Troy near the high altar within a magnificent oratory erected for that purpose exactly resembling the Gothic shrines of our cathedrals yet charged with many romantic decorations  With crafty archys raysyd wonder clene  Embowed over all the work to cure  So marveylous was the celature  That al the rofe and closure envyrowne  Was of  With  fyne goldè plated up and downe  With knottès gravè wonder curyous  Fret ful of stony's rich and precious c  The structure is supported by angels of gold The steps are of crystall Within is not only an image of Hector in solid gold but his body embalmed and exhibited to view with the resemblance of real life by means of a precious liquor circulating through every part in golden tubes artificially disposed and operating on the principles of vegetation This is from the chemistry of the times Before the body were four inextinguishible lamps in golden sockets To complete the work Priam founds a regular chantry of priests whom he accommodates with mansions near the church and endows with revenues to sing in this oratory for the soul of his son Hector  B iii  xxviii Joseph of Exeter in his Latin poem entitled ANTIOCHEIS or the CRUSADE has borrowed from this tomb of Hector in his brilliant description of the mausoleum of Teuthras lib iv I have quoted the passage in the SECOND DISSERTATION Signat i    In the Bodleian library there is a prodigious folio manuscript on vellum a translation of Colonna's TROJAN HISTORY into verse  MSS Laud K fol  which has been confounded with Lydgate's TROYEBOKE now before us But it is an entirely different work and is written in the short minstrelmetre I have given a specimen of the Prologue above  Supr vol i p  It appears to me to be Lydgate's TROYEBOKE divested of the octave stanza and reduced into a measure which might more commodiously be sung to the harp  It may however be thought that this poem is rather a translation or imitation of some French original as the writer often refers to  The Romance  If this be the case it is not immediately formed from the TROYEBOKE of Lydgate as I have suggested in the text I believe it to be about Lydgate's age but there is no other authority for supposing it to be written by Lydgate than that in the beginning of the Bodleian manuscript now before us a handwriting of about the reign of James the first assigns it to that poet I will give a few lines from the poem itself which begins with Jason's expedition to Cholcos the constant prelude to the Trojan story in all the writers of this school  In Colkos ile a cite was  That

salvation to the soul of the author of the  Romaunce  And he that this  romaunce  wroght and made  Lord in heven thow him glade  If this piece is translated from a French romance it is not from the antient metrical one of Benoit to whom I believe Colonna is much indebted but perhaps from some later French romance which copied or translated Colonna's book This among other circumstances we may collect from these lines  Dares the heraud of Troye says  And Dites that was of the Gregeis c  And after him cometh  maister  GY  That was of Rome a notary  This  maister Gy  or  Guy  that is Guido of Colonna he adds wrote this history  In the  manere  I schall telle  That is  "my author or romance follows Colonna"  See supr vol i p  Dares the heraud  is Dares Phrygius and  Dites  Dictys Cretensis  This poem in the Bodleian manuscript aforesaid is finished as I have partly observed with an invocation to god to save the author and the readers or hearers and ends with this line  Seythe alle Amen for charite  But this rubric immediately follows at the beginning of a page  "Hic bellum de Troy  ffinit et Greci transierunt versus p  triam suam"  Then follow several lineated pages of vellum without writing I have never seen any other manuscript of this piece  It is not likely that Lydgate is its  author that he should either thus transform his own composition or write a new piece on the subject That it was a poem in some considerable estimation appears from the size and splendour of the manuscript and this circumstance  induces me to believe that it was at a very early period ascribed to Lydgate On the other hand it is extraordinary that the name of the writer of so prolix and laborious a work respectable and conspicuous at least on account of its length should have never transpired The language accords with Lydgate's age and is of the reign of Henry the sixth and to the same age I refer the handwriting which is executed with remarkable elegance and beauty  SECT VI

outlines of the story which is not uninteresting nor inartificially constructed  Dioclesian a powerful emperour in Germany has a rupture with Barnard earl of Tholouse concerning boundaries of territory Contrary to the repeated persuasions of the empress who is extremely beautiful and famous for her conjugal fidelity he meets the earl with a numerous army in a pitched battle to decide the quarrel The earl is victorious and carries home a great multitude of prisoners the most respectable of which is sir Tralabas of Turky whom he treats as his companion In the midst of their festivities they talk of the beauties of the empress the earl's curiosity is inflamed to see so matchless a lady and he promises liberty to sir Tralabas if he can be conducted unknown to the emperour's court and obtain a sight of her without discovery They both set forward the earl disguised like a hermit When they arrive at the emperour's court sir Tralabas proves false treacherously imparts the secret to the empress that he has brought with him the earl  of Tholouse in disguise who is enamoured of her celebrated beauty and proposes to take advantage of so fair an opportunity of killing the emperour's great and avowed enemy She rejects the proposal with indignation injoyns the knight not to communicate the secret any farther and desires to see the earl next day in the chapel at mass The next day the earl in his hermit's weeds is conveniently placed at mass At leaving the chapel he asks an alms of the empress and she gives him forty florins and a ring He receives the present of the ring with the highest satisfaction and although obliged to return home in point of prudence and to avoid detection comforts himself with this reflection  Well is me I have thy grace  Of the to have thys thyng  If ever I have grace of the  That  any love betweene us be  This may be a TOKENYNG  He then returns home The emperour is called into some distant country and leaves his consort in the custody of two knights who attempting to gain her love without success contrive a stratagem to defame her chastity She is thrown into prison and the emperour returns unexpectedly  The emperour's disappointment is thus described  Anon to the chamber went he  He longyd sore his wyf to se  That was so swete a wyght  He callyd theym that shulde her kepe  Where is my wif is she on slepe  How farys that byrd so bryght  The traytors answeryd anon  And ye wi  t how she had done c  The yonge knyght sir Artour  That was her hervour c  For bale his armys abrode he sprede  And sell in swoone on his bed  in consequence of a vision The tale of the two treacherous knights is believed and she is sentenced to the flames yet under the restriction that if a champion can be found who shall foil the two knights in battle her honour shall be cleared and her life saved A challenge is published in all  parts of the world and the earl of Tholouse notwithstanding the animosities which still subsist between him and the emperour privately undertakes her quarrel He appears at the emperour's court in the habit of a monk and obtains permission to act as confessor to the empress in her present critical situation In the course of the confession she protests that she was always true to the emperour yet owns that once  she gave a ring to the earl of Tholouse  The supposed confessor pronounces her innocent of the charge brought against her on which one of the traiterous knights affirms  that the monk was suborned to publish this confession and that he deserved to be consumed in the same fire which was prepared for the lady The monk pretending that the honour of his religion and character was affected by this insinuation challenges both the knights to combat they are conquered and the empress after this trial is declared innocent He then openly discovers himself to be the earl of Tholouse the emperour's antient enemy A solemn reconciliation ensues The earl is appointed seneschal of the emperour's domain The emperour lives only three years and the earl is married to the empress  In the execution of this performance our author was obliged to be concise as the poem was intended to be sung to the harp Yet when he breaks through this restraint instead of dwelling on some of the beautiful situations which  he story affords he is diffuse in displaying trivial and unimportant circumstances These popular poets are never so happy as when they are describing a battle or a feast  It will not perhaps be deemed impertinent to observe that about this period the minstrels were often more amply paid than the clergy In this age as in more enlightened times the people loved better to be pleased than instructed During many of the years of the reign of Henry the sixth particularly in the year at the annual feast of the fraternity of the HOLIE CROSSE at Abingdon a town in  Berkshire twelve priests each received four pence for singing a dirge and the same number of minstrels were rewarded each with two shillings and four pence beside diet and horsemeat Some of these minstrels came only from Maydenhithe or Maidenhead a town at no great distance in the same county  Hearne's Lib Nig Scacc APPEND p  In the year eight priests were hired from Coventry to assist in celebrating a yearly obit in the church of the neighbouring priory of Maxtoke as were six minstrels called MIMI belonging to the family of  ord Clinton who lived in the adjoining castle of Maxtoke to sing harp and play in the hall of the monastery during the extraordinary refection allowed to the monks on that anniversary Two shillings were given to the priests and four to the minstrels  Ex Computis Prioris Priorat de Max  ock penes me See supr vol i p  "Dat sex Mimis domini Clynton cantantibus citharisantibus et

remainder of this section in fixing the reader's attention on an important circumstance now operating in its full extent and therefore purposely reserved for this period which greatly contributed to the improvement of our literature and consequently of our poetry I mean the many translations of Latin books especially classics which the French had been making for about the two last centuries and were still continuing to make into their own language In order to do this more effectually I will collect into one view the most distinguished of these versions not solicitous about those notices on this subject which have before occurred incidentally nor scrupulous about the charge of anticipation which to prepare the reader I shall perhaps incur by lengthening this enquiry for the sake of comprehension beyond the limits of the period just assigned In the mean time it may be pertinent to premise that from the close communication which formerly subsisted between England and France manuscript copies of many of these translations elegantly written and often embellished with the most splendid illuminations and curious miniatures were presented by the translators or their patrons to the kings of England and that they accordingly appear at present among the royal manuscripts in the British Museum Some of these however were transcribed if not translated by command of our kings and others brought into England and placed in the royal library by John duke of Bedford regent of France  It is not consistent with my design to enumerate the Latin legends rituals monastic rules chronicles and historical parts of the bible such as the BOOK OF KINGS and the MACCABEES which were looked upon as stories of chivalry  As  "Plusieurs Battailes des Roys d'Israel en contre les Philistien  et Assyrien  c"  Brit Mus MSS Reg D  translated by the French before the year These soon  became obsolete and are besides too deeply tinctured with the deplorable superstition and barbarity of their age to bear a recital  I must however except their LAPIDAIRE a poem on precious stones from the Latin of Marbodeus and the BESTIAIRE a set of metrical fables from the Latin Esop These however ought to be looked upon as efforts of their early poetry rather than translations  I will therefore begin with the thirteenth century In the year Peter Comestor's  Or  Le Mangeur  because he  devoured  the scriptures  HISTORIA SCHOLASTICA a sort of breviary of the old and new testament accompanied with elaborate expositions from Josephus and many pagan writers a work compiled at Paris about the year and so popular as not only to be taught in schools but even to be publicly read in the churches with its glosses was translated into French by Guiart des Moulins a canon of Aire  The French was first published without date or place in two tomes With old woodcuts Vossius says that the original was abridged by Gualter Hunte an English Carmelite about the year Hist Lat lib

paintings was ordered to be  written  by Edward the fourth at Bruges MSS Reg D i Another is written in Ibid B xvii  About the same time some of the old translations into French made in the eleventh century by Thibaud de Vernon canon of Rouen were retouched and the Latin legends of many lives of saints particularly of saint George of Thomas a Beckett and the martyrdom of saint Hugh a child murthered in by a Jew at Lincoln  See Chaucer PRIORES T p col v  were reduced into French verse These pieces to which I must add a metrical version of the bible from Genesis to Hezekiah by being written in rhyme and easy to be sung soon became popular and produced the desired impression on the minds of the people  It is rather beside my purpose to speak particularly of some of the divine Offices now made French and of the churchhymns  They were soon followed by the version of AEGIDIUS DE REGIMINE PRINCIPUM  See modo supr p And MSS Reg E vi And ibid B i And ibid A xx  "Stephanus Fortis

undertaken It is accompanied with a prolix commentary valuable only at present as preserving anecdotes of the opinions manners and literature of the writer's age and from which I am tempted to give the following specimen as it strongly illustrates the antient state of the French stage and demonstrably proves that comedy and tragedy were now known only by name in France  See supr vol i p  He observes that Comedies are so denominated from a room of entertainment or from those places in which banquets were accustomed to be closed with singing called in Greek CONIAS that they were like those  jeux  or plays which the minstrel  le Chanteur  exhibits in halls or other public places at a feast and that they were properly styled INTERLUDIA as being presented between the two courses Tragedies he adds were spectacles resembling those personages which at this day we see acting in the LIFE  and PASSION of a matyr  Ch viii liv ii  This shews that only the religious drama now subsisted in France But to proceed Cassianus's COLLATIONES PATRUM or the CONFERENCES was translated by John Goulain a Carmelite monk about Two translations of that theological romance Boethius's CONSOLATION one by the celebrated Jean de Meun author of the ROMANCE OF THE ROSE existed before the year Others of the early Latin christian writers were ordered to be turned into French by queen Jane about But finding that the archbishop of Rouen who was commissioned to execute this arduous task did not understand Latin she employed a mendicant friar About the same period and under the same patronage the LEGENDA AUREA written by James de Voragine archbishop of Genoa about the year that inexhaustible repository of religious fable  In the year the learned Claud Espence was obliged to make a public recantation for calling it LEGENDA FERREA Thuan sub ann Laun Hist Gymnas Navarr p  was translated by Jehan de Vignay a monk hospitalar  Brit Mus MSS Reg B xvii The copy was written This version seems to be the same which Caxton translated and printed While it was printing William lord Arundel gave Caxton annually a buck in summer and a doe in winter  The same translator gave also a version of a famous ritual entitled SPECULUM ECCLESIAE or the MIRROUR OF THE CHURCH of CHESS MORALISED written by Jacobus de Casulis  Brit Mus MSS Reg C xi This version was translated in English and printed by Caxton  and of Odoricus's VOYAGE INTO THE EAST  Ibid D i  Thomas Benoit a prior of saint Genevieve gratified the religious with a translation into a more intelligible language of some Latin liturgic pieces about the year But his chief performance was a translation into French verse of the RULE OF SAINT AUSTIN This he undertook merely on a principle of affection and charity for the edification of his pious brethren who did not understand Latin  Pour l'amour de vous très chers freres  En François ai traduit ce Latin  And in the preface he says  "Or sçaije que  plusieurs  de vous n'  entendent pas bien  LATIN auquel il fut chose necessaire de la rieule regle  entendre  "  Benoit's successour in the priorate of saint Genevieve was not equally attentive to the discipline and piety of his monks Instead of translating monkish Latin and enforcing the salutary regulations of saint Austin he wrote a system of rules for BALLADWRITING L'ART DE DICTIER BALLADE ET RONDELS the first Art of poetry that ever appeared in France  Among the moral books now translated I must not omit the SPIRITUELLE AMITIE of John of Meun from the Latin of Aldred an English monk  It is mentioned in the cata  ogue of his  traductions  at the beginning of his  C  ns  lation philosophique  I am not acquainted with the English monk  In the same style of mystic piety was the treatise of CONSOLATION written in Latin by Vincent de Beauvais and sent to saint Louis translated in the year In the year Henri de Suson a German dominican and a mystic doctor wrote a most comprehensive treatise called HOROLOGIUM SAPIENTIAE This was translated into French by a monk of saint François  Englished and printed by Caxton very early  Even the officers of the court of Charles the fifth were seized with the ardour of translating religious pieces no less than the ecclesiastics The most elegant tract of moral Latinity translated into French was the celebrated book of our countryman John of Salisbury DE NUGIS CURIALIUM This version was made by Denis Soulechart a learned Cordelier about the year Notwithstanding the EPISTLES of Abelard and Eloisa not only from the celebrity of Abelard as a Parisian theologist but on account of the interesting history of that unfortunate pair must have been as commonly known and as likely to be read in the original as any Latin  book in France they were translated into French in this century by John of Meun who prostituted his abilities when he relinquished his own noble inventions to interpret the pedantries of monks schoolmen and proscribed classics I think he also translated Vegetius who will occur again  There is a copy written in Brit Mus MSS Reg B xv Often ibid John of Meun is also said to have translated MIRABILIA HIBERNIAE  In the library of saint Genevieve there is in a sort of system of religion a piece called JERARCHIE translated from Latin into French at the command of our queen Elinor in the year by a French friar  "Cette JERARCHIE translata frere J  han de Pentham de Latin en Françoys à la requeste la r  ine d'Engleterre Alienore femme le roy Edward"  There is also this note in the manuscript  "Cest livre resigna frere Jordan

however forget that amidst this profusion of treatises of religion and instruction civil history found a place That immense chaos of events real and fictitious the HISTORICAL MIRROUR of Vincent de Beauvais was translated by Jehan de Vignay above mentioned  Brit Mus MSS Reg  E i  One is not surprised that the translator of the GOLDEN LEGEND should make no better choice  The desolation produced in France  A curious picture of the dis  racted state of France is recorded by Petrarch The king with the Dauphin returning from his captivity in England in passing through Picardy was obliged to make a pecuniary bargain with the numerous robbers that infested that country to travel unmolested  VIE PETR iii  by the victorious armies of the English was instantly succeeded by a flourishing state of letters King John having indulged his devotion and satisfied his conscience by procuring numerous versions of books written on sacred subjects at length turned his attention to the classics His ignorance of Latin was a fortunate circumstance as it produced a curiosity to know the treasures of Latin literature He employed Peter Bercheur prior of saint Eloi at Paris an eminent theologist to translate Livy into French  See Henault NOUVEL ABR  G HIST FR p edit to And VIE DE PERTRARQUE iii p  notwithstanding that author  had been anathematised by pope Gregory But so judicious a choice was undoubtedly dictated by Petrarch who regarded Livy with a degree of enthusiasm who was now resident at the court of France and who perhaps condescended to direct and superintend the translation The translator in his Latin work called REPERTORIUM a sort of general dictionary in which all things are proved to be allegorical and reduced to a moral meaning under the word ROMA records this great attempt in the following manner  "TITUM LIVIUM ad requisitionem domini Johannis inclyti Francorum regis  non sine labore et sudoribus  in linguam Gallicam transtuli  This was the translation of Livy which with other books the duke of Bedford regent of France about sent into England to Humphrey duke of Gloucester The copy had been a present to the king of France Mem Litt ii to See the SECOND

among the  French to polish and reform their old rude translations made two hundred years before and to reduce many of their metrical versions into prose At the same time the rage of translating ecclesiastical tracts began to decrease The latter circumstance was partly owing to the introduction of better books and partly to the invention of printing Instead of procuring laborious and expensive translations of the antient fathers the printers who multiplied greatly towards the close of this century found their advantage in publishing new translations of more agreeable books or in giving antient versions in a modern dress  I take this opportunity of observing that one of these was the romance of sir LANCELOT DU LAC translated from the Latin by Robert de Borron at the command of our Henry the second or third See supr vol i p This new LANCELOT I believe is the same which was printed at Paris by Antony Verard In three vast folio volumes Another is the romance of GYRON LE COURTOIS translated also from Latin at the command of the same monarch by Lucas or Luce  chevalier du Chateau du Gast  or  Gat  or  Gal  and printed by Verard as above See Lenglet Bibl Rom ii p The

Constantinople and Antioch all the cardinals five hundred bishops and archbishops sixty abbots more than a thousand prelates and priests of lower rank the ambassadors of many kings and potentates the

and under the patronage of many devout duchesses Yet in the mean time the lives of saints and sacred history gave way to a species of narrative more entertaining and not less fabulous Little more than Josephus and a few MARTYRDOMS were now translated from the Latin into French  The truth is the French translators of this century were chiefly employed on profane authors At its commencement a French abridgement of the three first decads of Livy was produced by Henri Romain a canon of Tournay In the year Jean de Courci a knight of Normandy gave a translation of some Latin chronicle a HISTORY OF THE GREEKS AND ROMANS entitled BOUQUASSIERE In Jean de Courteauisse a doctor in theology at Paris translated Seneca on the FOUR CARDINAL VIRTUES  It is supposititious It was forged about the year by Martianus an archbishop of Portugal whom Gregory of Tours calls the most eminent writer of his time Hist Franc v It was a great favourite of the theological ages  Under the reign of king Charles the seventh Jean Cossa translated the CHRONOLOGY of Mattheus Palmerius a learned Florentine and a writer of Italian poetry in imitation of Dante In the dedication to Jane the third queen of Jerusalem and among other titles countess of Provence the translator apologises for supposing her highness to be ignorant of Latin when at the same time he is fully convinced that a lady endowed with so much natural grace must be perfectly acquainted with that language  "Mais pour ce que le vulgar Françoys est plus commun j' ai pris peine y translater ladite oeuvre"  Two other translations were offered to Charles the seventh in the year One of the FIRST PUNIC war of Leonard of Arezzo an anonymous writer who does not chuse to publish his name  a cause de sa petitesse  and the STRATAGEMS of  Frontinus often cited by John of Salisbury and mentioned in the Epistles of Peter of Blois  Epist  by Jean de Rouroy a Parisian theologist Under Louis the eleventh Sebastian Mamerot of Soissons in the year attempted a new translation of the ROMULEON and he professes that he undertook it solely with a view of improving or decorating the French language  I am not sure whether this is not much the same as

translated I suppose from the Latin the OECONOMICS of Aristotle and Tully's DE AMICITIA and DE SENECTUTE before the year  The two latter versions were translated into English by William Botoner and John Tiptoft earl of Worcester and printed by Caxton Botoner presented his manuscript copy to William of Waynflete bishop of Winchester in See supr p Caxton's English CATO printed was from the French As were his FABLES OF AESOP printed  He is said also to have translated some pieces perhaps the EPISTLES of Seneca  Crucimanius mentions a version of Seneca by Premi  rfait as printed at Paris in Bibl

Encouraged by this example Jean de Luxembourgh Laurence's cotemporary translated Tully's Oration against Verres I must not forget that Hippocrates and Galen were translated from Latin into French in the year The translator was Jean Tourtier surgeon to the duke of Bedford then regent of France and he humbly supplicates Rauoul Palvin confessor and physician to the duchess and John Major first physician to the duke and graduate  en l'estude d'Auxonford  Oxonford Oxford  and master Roullan physician and astronomer of the university of Paris amicably to amend the faults of this translation which is intended to place the science and practice of medicine on a new foundation I presume it was from a Latin version that the ILIAD about this period was translated into French metre  Among other pieces that might be enumerated in this century in the year Guillaume de Tignonville provost of Paris translated the DICTA PHILOSOPHORUM  Brit Mus MSS Reg A viii Saepius ibid This version was translated into English by lord Rivers and printed by Caxton  as did Jean Gallopes dean of the collegiate church of saint Louis of Salsoye in Normandy the ITER VITAE HUMANAE of Guillaume prior of Chalis  See Labb Bibl MSS p Bibl Roman ii And Oudin iii Guillaum lived about Some of the French literary antiquaries suppose this to be a Latin piece It is  however in French verse which was reduced into prose by Gallopes  This version entitled LE PELERINAGE DE LA VIE HUMAINE is dedicated to Jean queen of Sicily above mentioned a duchess of Anjou and a countess of Provence who without any sort of difficulty could make a transition from the Life of sir Lancelot to that of saint Austin and who sometimes quitted the tribunal of the COURT OF LOVE to confer with learned ecclesiastics in an age when gallantry and religion were of equal importance He also translated from the same author a composition of the same ideal and contemplative cast called LE PELERIN DE L'AME highly esteemed by those visionaries who preferred  religious allegory to romance which was dedicated to the duke of Bedford  I am not certain whether this is Caxton's PILGRIMAGE OF THE SOWLE an English translation from the French printed in fol Ames says that Antonine Gerard is the author of the French which was printed at Paris Hist Print p  In Bennet college library at Cambridge there is an elegant illuminated manuscript of Bonaventure's LIFE OF CHRIST translated by Gallopes containing a curious picture of the translator presenting his version to our Henry the fifth  See ARCHAEOL vol ii p And Brit Mus MSS

compilation of all that was marvellous in Pliny Solinus and the OTIA IMPERIALIA a book abounding in wonders of our countryman Gervais of Tilbury  He flourished about the year  The French romance entitled L'ASSAILLANT was now translated from the Latin chronicles of the kings of Cologne and the Latin tract DE BONIS MORIBUS of Jacobus Magnus confessor to Charles the seventh about the year was made French  See supr p There is a version of Boccacio's DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS perhaps by Premierfait Brit Mus MSS Reg C v  Rather earlier Jean de Premierfait translated BOCCACIO DE CASIBUS VIRORUM ILLUSTRIUM  This version was Englished and printed by Caxton  Nor shall I be thought to deviate too far from my detail which is confined to Latin originals when I mention here a book the translation of which into French conduced in an eminent degree to circulate materials for poetry this is Boccacio's DECAMERON which Premierfait also translated at the command of queen Jane of Navarre who seem  to have made no kind of conditions about suppressing the licentious stories in the year  See Brit Mus MSS Reg E i Where it is said that the Decameron wa  first translated into Latin It is not very literal It was printed at Paris fol Again ibid vo It was again translated by Antoine le Macon fol Paris And often afterwards    I am not exactly informed when the ENEID of Virgil was translated into a sort of metrical romance or history of Eneas  under the title of LIVRE D' ENEIDOS COMPILE PAR VIRGILE by Guillaume de Roy But that translation was printed at Lyons in and appears to have been finished not many years before Among the translator's historical additions are the description of the first foundation of Troy by Priam and the succession of Ascanius and his descendants after the death of Turnus He introduces a digression upon Boccacio for giving in his FALL OF PRINCES an account of the death of Dido different from that in the fourth book of the Eneid Among his omissions he passes over Eneas's descent into hell as a tale manifestly forged and not to be believed by any rational reader as if many other parts of the translator's story were not equally fictitious and incredible  It was translated and printed by Caxton    The conclusion intended to be drawn from this long digression is obvious By means of these French translations our countrymen who understood French much better than Latin became acquainted with many useful books which they would not otherwise have known With such assistances a commodious access to the classics was opened and the knowledge of antient literature facilitated and familiarised in England at a much earlier period than is imagined and at a time when little more than the productions of speculative monks and irrefragrable doctors could be obtained or were studied Very few Englishmen I will venture to pronounce had read Livy before the translation of Bercheur was imported by the regent duke of Bedford It is certain that many of the Roman poets and historians were now read in England in the original But the Latin language was for the most part confined to a few ecclesiastics When these authors therefore appeared in a language almost as intelligible as the English they fell into the hands of illiterate and common readers and contributed to sow the seeds of a national erudition and to form a popular taste  Even the French versions of the religious philosophical historical and allegorical compositions of those more enlightened Latin writers who flourished in the middle ages had their use till better books came into vogue pregnant as they were with absurdities they communicated instruction on various and new subjects enlarged the field of information and promoted the love of reading by gratifying that growing literary curiosity which now began to want materials for the exercise of its operations How greatly our poets in general availed themselves of these treasures we may collect from this circumstance only even such writers as Chaucer and Lydgate men of education and learning when they translate a Latin author appear to execute their work through the medium of a French version It is needless to pursue this history of French translation any farther I have given my reason for introducing it at all In the next age a great and universal revolution in literature ensued and the English themselves began to turn their thoughts to translation  These French versions enabled Caxton our first printer to enrich the state of letters in this country with many valuable publications He found it no difficult task either by himself or the help of his friends to turn a considerable number of these pieces into English which he printed Antient learning had as yet made too little progress among us to encourage this enterprising and industrious artist to publish the Roman autho  s in their original language  It is however remarkable that from the year in which Caxton began to print down to the year during which period the English press flourished greatly under the conduct of many industrious ingenious and even learned artists only the very few following classics some of which hardly deserve that name were printed in England These were BOETHIUS  de Consolatione  both Latin and English for Caxton without date The Latin ESOPIAN Fables in verse for Wynkyn de Worde to And once or twice afterwards TERENCE with the Comment of Badi  s Ascensius for the same to VIRGIL'S BUCOLICS for the same to Again to TULLY'S OFFICES Latin and English the translation by Whittington to The university of Oxford during this period produced only the first Book of TULLY'S EPISTLES at the charge of cardinal Wolsey without date or printer's name Cambridge not a single classic  No Greek book of any  kind had yet appeared from an English press I believe the first Greek characters used in any work printed in England are in Linacer's translation of  Galen de Temperamentis  printed at Cambridge in to A few Greek words and abbreviatures are here and there introduced The printer was John Siberch a German a friend of Erasmus who styles himself  primus  UTRIUSQUE  linguae in Anglia impressor  There are Greek characters in some of his other books of this date But he printed no entire Greek book In Linacer's treatise  De emendata Structura Latini sermonis  printed by Pinson in many Greek characters are intermixed In the sixth book are seven Greek lines together But the printer apologises for his imperfections and unskillfulness in the Greek types which he says were but recently cast and not in a sufficient quantity for such a work The passage is curious  "Aequo animo feras siquae literae in exemplis Hellenismi vel  tonis  vel  spiritibus  careant His enim non  satts instructus  erat typographus videlicet  recens  ab  eo fusis  ch  racteribus Graecis nec  parata  ei  copia  qua ad hoc agendum opus est"  About the same period of the English press the same embarrassments appear to have happened with regard to Hebrew types which yet were more likely as that language was so much less known In the year doctor Robert Wakefield chaplain to Henry the eighth published his  Oratio de laudibus et utilitate trium linguarum Arabicae Chald  ic  et Hebraicae  c to The printer was Wynkyn de Worde and the author complains that he was obliged to omit his whole third part because the printer had no Hebrew types Some few Hebrew and Arabic characters however are introduced but extremely rude and evidently cut in wood They are the first of the sort used in England This learned orientalist was instrumental in preserving at the dissolution of monasteries the Hebrew manuscripts of Ramsey abbey collected by Holbech one of the monks together with Holbech's  Hebrew Dictionary  Wood Hist Ant Univ Oxon ii Leland Scriptor v HOLBECCUS  It was a circumstance favourable at least to English literature owing indeed to the general illiteracy of the times that our first printers were so little employed on books written in the learned languages Almost all Caxton's books are English The multiplication of English copi  s multiplied English readers and these again produced new vernacular writers The existence of a press induced many persons to turn authors who were only qualified to write in their native tongue  and had not the French furnished him with these materials it is not likely that Virgil Ovid Cicero and many other good  writers would by the means of his press have been circulated in the English tongue so early as the close of the fifteenth century  •    SECT VII  THE first poet that occurs in the

compendious in his narrative of events from Brutus to the reign of king Henry the fourth he is much more minute and diffuse in relating those affairs of which for more than the space of sixty years he was a living witness and which occurred from that period to the reign of Edward the fourth The poem seems to have been completed about the year In his final chapter he exhorts the king to recall his rival king Henry the sixth and to restore the partisans of that unhappy prince  This work is almost beneath criticism and fit only for the attention of an antiquary Harding may be pronounced to be the most impotent of our metrical historians especially when we recollect the great improvements which English poetry had now received I will not even except Robert of Gloucester who lived in the infancy of taste and versification The chronicle of this authentic and laborious annalist has hardly those more modest graces which could properly recommend and adorn a detail of the British story in prose He has left some pieces in prose and Winstanly says  "as his prose was very usefull so was his poetry as much delightfull"  I am of opinion that both his prose and poetry are equally useful and

appellation of LAUREATE occurs John Kay was appointed poet laureate to Edward the fourth It is extraordinary that he should have left no pieces of poetry to prove his pretensions in some degree to this office with which he is said to have been invested by the king at his return from Italy The only composition he has transmitted to posterity is a prose English translation of a Latin history of

scholastic laureations however seem to have given rise to the appellation in question I will give some instances at Oxford which at the same time will explain the nature of the studies for which our accademical philologists received their rewards About the year one John Watson a student in grammar obtained a concession to be graduated and laureated in that science on condition that he composed one hundred Latin verses in praise of the university and a Latin comedy  Registr Univ Oxon G fol I take this opportunity of acknowledging my obligations to the learned Mr Swinton keeper of the Archives at Oxford for giving me frequent and free access to the Registers of that university  Another grammarian was distinguished with the same badge after having stipulated that at the next public Act he would affix the same number of hexameters on the great gates of saint Mary's church that they might be seen by the whole university This was at that period the most convenient mode of publication  Ibid  fol  About the same time one Maurice Byrchensaw  a scholar in rhetoric supplicated to be admitted to read lectures that is to take a degree in that faculty and his petition was granted with a provision that he should write one hundred verses on the glory of the university and not suffer Ovid's ART OF LOVE and the Elegies of Pamphilus  Ovid's supposititious pieces and other verses of the lower age were printed together by Goldastus Francof vo Among these is  "Pamphili Mauriliani PAMPHILUS  ive de Arte Amandi Elegiae lxiii"  This is from the same school with Ovid DE VETULA and by some thought to be forged by the same author  to be studied in his auditory  Registr Univ Oxon G fol a  Not long afterwards one John Bulman another rhetorician having complied with the terms imposed of explaining the first book of Tully's OFFICES and likewise the first of his EPISTLES without any pecuniary emolument was graduated in rhetoric and a crown of laurel was publicly placed

Poet laureate of the kings of England an officer of the court remaining under that title to this day he is undoubtedly the same that is styled the KING'S VERSIFIER and to whom one hundred shillings were paid as his annual stipend in the year  See supr vol i p  But when or how that title commenced and whether this officer was ever solemnly crowned with laurel at his first investiture I will not pretend to determine after the  earches of the learned Selden on this question have proved unsuccessful It seems most probable that the barbarous and inglorious name of VERSIFIER gradually gave way to an appellation of more elegance and dignity or rather that at length those only were in general invited to this appointment who had received accademical sanction and had merited a crown of laurel in the universities for their abilities in Latin composition particularly Latin versification Thus the  king's Laureate  was nothing more than  "a  graduated  rhetorician  employed in the service of the king"  That he originally wrote in Latin appears from the antient title  versificator  and may be moreover collected from the two Latin poems which Baston and Gulielmus who appear to have respectively acted in the capacity of royal poets to Richard the first and Edward the second officially composed on Richard's crusade and Edward's  iege of Striveling castle  See supr vol i p By the way Baston is called by Bale  "laureatus apud Oxonienses"  Cent iv cap    Andrew Bernard successively poet laureate of Henry the seventh and the eighth affords a still stronger proof that this officer was a Latin scholar He was a native of Tholouse and an Augustine monk He was not only the king's poet laureate  See an instrument PRO POETA LAUREATO dat Rymer's FO  D tom xii p But by the way in this instrument there is no specification of any thing to be done  officially  by Bernard The king only grants to Andrew Bernard  Poetae  au  ato  which we may construe either THE  laureated poet  or  A poet laureate  a salary of ten marcs till he can obtain some equivalent appointment This however is only a precept to the treasurer and chamberlains to disburse the salary and refers to letters patent not printed by Rymer It is certain that Gower and Chaucer were never appointed to this office notwithstanding this is commonly supposed Skelton in his CROWNE OF LAWRELL sees Gower Chaucer and Lydgate approach he describes their whole apparel as glittering with the richest precious stones and then immediately adds  They wanted nothing but the LAURELL  Afterwards however there is the rubric  Maister Chaucer

JUL A    I am of opinion that it was not customary for the royal laureate to write in English till the reformation of religion had begun to diminish the veneration for the Latin language or rather till the love of novelty and a better sense of things had banished the narrow pedantries of monastic erudition and taught us to cultivate our native tongue In the mean time it is to be wished that another change might at least be suffered to take place in the execution of this institution which is confessedly Gothic and unaccommodated to modern manners I mean that the more than annual return of a composition on a trite argument would be no longer required I am conscious I say this at a time when the best of kings affords the most just and copious theme for panegyric but I speak it at a time when the department is honourably filled by a poet of taste and genius which are idly wasted on the most splendid subjects when imposed by constraint and perpetually repeated  To what is here incidentally collected on an article more  curious than important I add an observation which shews that the practice of other nations in this respect altogether corresponded with that of our own When we read of the laureated poets of Italy and Germany we are to remember that they most commonly received this honour from the state or some university seldom at least not immediately from the prince and if we find any of these professedly employed in the department of a courtpoet that they were not in consequence of that peculiar situation styled poets laureate The distinction at least in general was previously conferred  The reader who requires a full and particular information concerning the first origin of the laureation of poets and the solemnities with which this ceremony was performed in Italy and Germany is referred to Selden's TIT HON Op tom p seq VIE DE PETRARQUE tom iii  Notes  c p Not quat And to a memoir of M l'Abbè du Resnel MEM LIT x to I will only add the form of the creation

chemist and adds that Cremer brought Lully into England and introduced him to the notice of Edward the third about the year Ashmol ubi supr p The writer of HERMES'S BIRD however appears by the versification and language to have lived at least an hundred years after that period He informs us that he made the translation  "owte of the Frensche"  Ibid p Ashmole mentions a curious picture of the GRAND MYST  RIES OF THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE which abbot Cremer ordered to  e painted in Westminster abbey upon an arch where the waxen kings and queens are placed but that it was obliterated with a plaisterer's brush by the puritans in Oliver's time He al  o mentions a large and beautiful window  behind the pulpit in the neighbouring church of saint Margaret painted with the same subject and

period of our poetical history if the poems lately discovered at Bristol and said to have been written by Thomas Rowlie a secular priest of that place about the year one thousand four hundred and seventy are genuine  It must be acknowledged that there are some circumstances which incline us to suspect these pieces to be a modern forgery On the other hand as there is some degree of plausibility in the history of their discovery as they possess considerable merit and are held to be the real productions of Rowlie by many respectable critics it is my duty to give them a place in this series of our poetry if it was for no other reason than that the world might be furnished with an opportunity of examining their authenticity By exhibiting therefore the most specious evidences which I have been able to collect concerning the manner in which they were brought to light  I acknowledge myself greatly indebted to the ingenious doctor Harrington of Bath for facilitating my enquiries on this subject  and by producing such specimens as in another respect cannot be deemed unacceptable I will endeavour not only to gratify the curiosity of the public on a subject that has long engaged the general attention and has never yet been fairly or fully stated but to supply the more inquisitive reader with every argument both external and internal for determining the merits of this interesting controversy I shall take the liberty to add my own opinion on a point at least doubtful but with the greatest deference to decisions of much higher authority  About the year William Cannynge an opulent merchant and an alderman of Bristol afterwards an ecclesiastic  and dean of Westbury college erected the magnificent church of Saint Mary of Redcliffe or Radcliff near Bristol  He is said to have rebuilt Westbury college Dugd WARWICKSH p edit And Atkyns GLOCESTERSH p On his monument in Radcliffechurch he is twice represented both in an alderman's and a priest's habit He was five times mayor of Bristol See Godwin's BISH p But see edit fol p  In a munimentroom over the northern portico of the church the founder placed an iron chest secured by six different locks  It is said there were four chests but this is a circumstance of no consequence  which seems to have been principally intended to receive instruments relating to his new structure and perhaps to his other charities  These will be mentioned below  inventories of vestments and ornaments  See an inventory of ornaments given to this church by the founder Jul  ormerly kept in this chest and printed by Mr Walpole AN  CD PAINT i p  accompts of churchwardens and other parochial evidences He is said to have directed that this venerable chest should be annually visited and opened by the mayor and other chief magistrates of Bristol attended by the vicar and churchwardens of the parish and that a feast should be celebrated every year on the day of visitation But this order that part at least which relates to the inspection of the chest was soon neglected  In the year when the present new bridge at Bristol was finished and opened for passengers an account of the ceremonies observed on occasion of opening the old bridge appeared in one of the Bristol Journals taken as it was declared from an antient manuscript  The old bridge was built about the year HISTORY of BRISTOL MS Archiv Bodl C iii By Abel Wantner  Archdeacon Furney in the year left by will to the Bodleian library large collections by va  ious hands relating to the history and antiquities of the city church and county of Gloucester which are now preserved there Archiv C ut supr At the end of N iii is the manuscript HISTORY just mentioned supposed to have been compiled by Abel Wantner of MinchinHampton in Glocestershire who published proposals and specimens for a history of that county in  Curiosity was naturally raised to know from whence it came At length after much enquiry concerning the person who sent this singular memoir to the newspaper it was discovered that he  was a youth about seventeen years old whose name was Chatterton and whose father had been sexton of Radcliffe church for many years and also master of a writingschool in that parish of which the churchwardens were trustees The father however was now dead and the son was at first unwilling to acknowledge from whom or by what means he had procured so valuable an original But after many promises and some threats he confessed that he received a manuscript on parchment containing the narrative abovementioned together with many other manuscripts on parchment  from his father who had found them in an iron chest the same that I have mentioned placed in a room situated over the northern entrance of the church  It appears that the father became possessed of these manuscripts in the year For in that year he was permitted by the churchwardens of Radcliffechurch to take from this chest several written pieces of parchment supposed to be illegible and useless for the purpose of converting them into covers for the writingbooks of his scholars It is impossible to ascertain what or how many writings were destroyed in consequence of this absurd and unwarrantable indulgence Our schoolmaster however whose accomplishments were much above his station and who was not totally destitute of a taste for poetry found as it is said in this immense heap of obsolete manuscripts many poems written by Thomas Rowlie abovementioned priest of Saint John's church in Bristol and the confessor of alderman Cannynge which he carefully preserved These at his death of course fell into the hands of his son  Of the extraordinary talents of this young man more will be said hereafter It will be sufficient to observe at present that he saw the merit and value of these poems which he diligently transcribed In the year he went to London carrying with him these transcripts and many originals in hopes of turning so in  stimable a treasure to his great  advantage But from these flattering expectations falling into a dissipated course of life which ill suited with his narrow circumstances and finding that a writer of the most distinguished taste and judgement Mr Walpole had pronounced the poems to be suspicious in a fit of despair arising from distress and disappointment he destroyed all his papers and poisoned himself Some of the poems however both transcripts and originals he had previously sold either to Mr Catcott a merchant of Bristol or to Mr Barrett an eminent surgeon of the same place and an ingenious antiquary with whom they now remain  Mr Barrett to whom I am greatly o  iged  or his unreserved and liberal information on this subject is now engaged in writing the ANTIQUITIES of BRISTOL  But it appears that among these there were but very few of parchment most of the poems which they purchased were copies in his own hand He was always averse to give any distinct or satisfactory account of what he possessed but from time to time as his necessities required he produced copies of his originals which were bought by these gentlemen The originals one or two only excepted he chose to retain in his own possession  The chief of these poems are The TRAGEDY of ELLA The EXECUTION of sir CHARLES BAWDWIN ODE to ELLA The BATTLE of HASTINGS The TOURNAMENT one or two DIALOGUES and a Description of CANNYNGE'S FEAST  The TRAGEDY OF ELLA has six characters one of which is a lady named Birtha It has a chorus consisting of minstrels whose songs are often introduced Ella was governor of the castle of Bristol and a puissant champion against the Danes about the year The story seems to be the poet's invention The tragedy is opened with the following soliloquy  CELMONDE  atte Brystowe  Before yonne roddie sonne has

ode which certainly cannot be genuine is beneath transcription The writer freely owning his inferiority declares that Rowlie rivals Chaucer and Turgotus who both lived in  Norman tymes  The latter indeed may in some measure be said to have flourished in that era for he died bishop of Saint Andrews in But he is oddly coupled with Chaucer in another respect for he wrote only some Latin chronicles Besides Lydgate must have been sufficiently acquainted with Chaucer's age for he was living and a young man when Chaucer died The writer also m  ntions Stone the Carmelite as living with Chaucer and Turgotus whereas he was Lydgate's cotemporary These circumstances added to that of the extreme and affected meanness of the composition evidently prove this little piece a forgery  I will give this

allowed to be modern even by those who maintain all the other poems to be antient  It contains stanzas and was printed at London in the year to I am told that in the abovementioned chest belonging to Radcliffechurch an antient Record was discovered containing the expences for Edward the fourth to see the execution of sir Charles Baldwin with a description of a canopy under which the king  ate at thi  execution This Record seems to have given rise to the poem A bond which sir Charles Baldwin gave to king Henry the sixth I suppose about seizing the earl of Warwick is said to have be  n mentioned in one of Rowlie's manuscripts called the YELLOW ROLL perhaps the same found in Cannynge's chest but now lost See Stowe's CHRON by Howes edit fol p col And Speed's p col edit Stowe says that king Edward  the fourth was  at Bristol on a progress through England in the  harvest s  ason  of the year And that he was  mos  royally received  Ibid p col Cannynge was then mayor of Bristol Sir Charles Baldwin is said to have been executed at Bristol in the presence of Edward the fourth in the year MS Wantn Bibl Bodl ut supr The same king was at Bristol and lodged in saint Augu  tine's abbey in when he received a large gratuity from the citizens for carrying on the war against France Wantner ibid  The ODE TO ELLA and the EPISTLE to Lydgate with his ANSWER were written on one piece of parchment and as pretended in Rowlie's own hand This was shewn to an ingenious critic and intelligent antiquary of my acquaintance who assure  me that the writing was a gross and palpable forgery It was not even skilfully counterfeited The form of the letters although artfully contrived to wear an antiquated appearance differed very essentially from every one of our early alphabets Nor were the characters uniform and consistent part of the same manuscript exhibiting some letters shaped  according to the present round hand while others were traced in imitation of the antient court and text hands The parchment was old and that it might look still older was stained on the outside with ochre which was easily rubbed off with a linen cloth Care had also been evidently taken to tincture the ink with a yellow cast To communicate a stronger stamp of rude antiquity the ODE was written like prose no distinction or termination being made between the several verses Lydgate's ANSWER which makes a part of this manuscript and is written by the same hand I have already proved to be a manifest imposition This parchment has since been unfortunately lost  At the same time another manuscript on parchment written as pretended by Rowlie was shewn to this gentleman which tallying in every respect with the ODE to ELLA plainly appeared to be forged in the same manner and by the same modern hand It was in prose and contained an account of Saxon coins and the rise of coining in England with a list of coins poems antient inscriptions monuments and other curiosities in the cabinet of Cannynge abovementioned This parchment is also lost and I believe no copy remain    I have myself carefully examined the original manuscript as it is called of the little piece entitled ACCOUNTE OF W CANNYNGE'S FEAST It is likewise on parchment and I am sorry to say that the writing betrays all the suspicious signatures which were observed in that of the ODE TO ELLA I have repeatedly and diligently compared it with three or four authentic manuscripts of the time of Edward the fourth to all which I have found it totally unlike Among other smaller vestiges of forgery which cannot be so easily described and explained here at the bottom are added in ink two coats of arms containing empalements of Cannynge and of his friends or relations with familynames apparently delineated by the same pen which wrote the verses Even the style and drawing of the armorial bearings discover the hand of a modern herald This I believe is the only pretended original of the poetry of Rowlie now remaining  As to internal arguments an unnatural affectation of antient spelling and of obsolete words not belonging to the period assigned to the poems strikes us at first sight Of these old words combinations are frequently formed which never yet existed in the unpolished state of the English language and sometimes the antiquated diction is most inartificially misapplied by an improper contexture with the present modes of speech The attentive reader will also discern that our poet sometimes forgets his assumed character and does not always act his part with consistency for the chorus or interlude of the damsel who drowns herself which I have cited at length from the TRAGEDY of ELLA is much more intelligible and free from uncouth expressions than the general phraseology of these compositions In the BATTLE OF HASTINGS said to be translated from the Saxon Stonehenge is called a Druidical temple The battle of Hastings was fought in the year We will grant the Saxon original to have been written soon afterwards about which time no other notion prevailed concerning this miraculous monument than the supposition which had been delivered down by long and constant tradition that it was erected in memory of Hengist's massacre This was the established and uniform opinion of the Welsh and Armorican bards who most probably received it from the Saxon minstrels and that this was the popular belief at the time of the battle of Hastings appears from the evidence of Geoffrey of Monmouth who wrote his history not more than eighty years after that memorable event And in this doctrine Robert of Gloucester and all the monkish chroniclers agree That the Druids constructed this stupendous pile for a place of worship was a discovery reserved for the sagacity of a wiser age and the laborious discussion of modern antiquaries In the EPISTLE to Lydgate prefixed to the TRAGEDY our poet condemns the absurdity and impropriety of the religious dramas and recommends  SOME GREAT STORY OF HUMAN MANNERS as most suitable for theatrical representation But this idea is the result of that taste and discrimination which could only belong to a more advanced period of society  It would be tedious and trifling to descend to minute particulars But I will mention one or two In the ODE TO ELLA the poet supposes that the spectre of Ella sometimes appears in the  mynster  that is Bristolcathedral But when Rowlie is supposed to have lived the present cathedral of Bristol was nothing more than an Augustine monastery in which Henry the eighth established long afterwards a bishop and a dean and chapter in the year  Minster  is a word almost appropriated to Cathedrals and I will venture to say that the church of this monastery before the present foundation took place never was called  Bristolminster  or  The minster  The inattention to this circumstance has produced another unfortunate anachronism in some of Rowlie's papers Where in his panegyric on Cannynge he says  "The favouryte of godde the  ryende of the chyrche the companyonne of kynges and the fadre of hys natyve CITIE the grete and good Wyllyamme Canynge"  Bristol was never styled a CITY till the erection of

early as the year the word  Accounte  had lost its literal and original sense of a  computus  or  computation  and was used in a looser acceptation for  narrative  or  detail  Nor had it even then lost its true spelling  accompt  in which its proper and primary signification is preserved and implied    But above all the cast of thought the complexion of the sentiments and the structure of the composition evidently prove these pieces not antient The ODE TO ELLA for instance has exactly the air of modern poetry such I mean as is written at this day only disguised with antique spelling and phraseology That Rowlie was an accomplished literary character a scholar an historian and an antiquarian if contended for I will not deny  He is also said to have been an eminent mechanic and mathematician I am informed that one of Rowlie's manuscripts discovered in Cannynge's iron chest was a plan for supporting the tower of the Templechurch in B  istol which had greatly declined from its perpendicular In a late reparation of that church some subterraneous works were found minutely corresponding with this manuscript  Nor is it impossible that he might write English poetry But that he is the writer of the poems which I have here cited and  which have been so confidently ascribed to him I am not yet convinced  On the whole I am inclined to believe that these poem  were composed by the son of the schoolmaster before mentioned who inherited the inestimable treasures of Cannynge's chest in Radcliffechurch as I have already related at large This youth who died at eighteen was a prodigy of genius and would have proved the first of English poets had he reached a maturer age From his childhood he was fond of reading and writing verses and some of his early compositions which he wrote without any design to deceive have been judged to be most astonishing productions by the first critic of the present age From his situation and connections he became a skilful practitioner in various kinds of handwriting Availing himself therefore of his poetical talent and his facility in the graphic art to a miscellany of obscure and neglected parchments which were commodiously placed in his own possession he was tempted to add others of a more interesting nature and such as he was enabled to forge under these circumstances without the fear of detection As to his knowledge of the old English literature which is rarely the study of a young poet a sufficient quantity of obsolete words and phrases were readily attainable from the glossary to Chaucer and to Percy's Ballads It is confessed that this youth wrote the EXECUTION OF SIR CHARLES BAWDWIN and he who could forge that poem might easily forge all the rest  In the mean time we will allow that some pieces of poetry written by Rowlie might have been preserved in Cannynge's chest and that these were enlarged and improved by young Chatterton But if this was the case they were so much altered as to become entirely new compositions The poem which bids the fairest to be one of these originals is CANNYNGE'S FEAST But the parchmentmanuscript of this little poem has already been proved to be a forgery A circumstance  which is perhaps alone sufficient to make us suspect that no originals ever existed  It will be asked for what end or purpose did he contrive such an imposture I answer from lucrative views or perhaps from the pleasure of deceiving the world a motive which in many minds operates more powerfully than the hopes of gain He probably promised himself greater emoluments from this indirect mode of exercising his abilities or he might have sacrificed even the vanity of appearing in the character of an applauded original author to the private enjoyment of the success of his invention and dexterity  I have observed above that Cannynge ordered his iron chest in Radcliffechurch to be solemnly visited once in every year and that an annual entertainment should be provided for the visitors In the notices relating to this matter which some of the chief patrons of Rowlie's poetry hav  lately sent me from Bristol it is affirmed that this order is contained in Cannynge's will and that he specifies therein that not only his manuscript evidences abovementioned but that the POEMS of HIS CONFESSOR ROWLIE which likewise he had deposited in the aforesaid iron chest were also to be submitted to this annual inspection This circumstance at first strongly inclined me to think favourably of the authenticity of these pieces At least it proved that Rowlie had left some performances in verse But on examining Cannynge's will no such order appears All his bequests relating to Radcliffechurch of every kind are the following He leaves legacies to the vicar and the three clerks of the said church to the two chantrypriests or chaplains of his foundation to the keeper of the PYXIS OBLATIONUM in the northdoor and to the fraternity  Commemoracionis martirum  Also vestments to the altars of saint Catharine and saint George He mentions his tomb built near the altar of saint Catharine where his late wife is inrerred He gives augmentations to the endowment of his  two chantries  Compare Willis MITR ABB ii  at the altars of saint Catharine and saint George abovementioned To the choir he leaves two servicebooks called  Liggers  to be used there on either side by his two chantrypriests He directs that his funeral shall be celebrated in the said church with a  month's mind  and the usual solemnities  This will is in Latin dated Nov Proved Nov It was made in Westbury college Cur Praerog Cant Registr WATTIS quatern xvii fol Beside the bequests mentioned in the text he leaves legacies to all the canons the chaplains and deacons and the twelve choristers of Westbury college To the six

s  To rebuilding the tower of the church of Compton Graynefield xl  s  He also makes bequests to his almshouses at Bristol and to the corporation of that town He remembers some of the religious

this will the name of ROWLIE is not mentioned Compare Tanner NOTIT MONAST p And Atkyns's GLOUCESTERSH p  Bishop Carpenter about the year was a considerable benefactor to Westbury college He pulled down the old college  "and in the new building enlarged it very much compassing it about with a strong wall embattled adding a faire gate with divers towers more like unto a castle than a colledge and lastly bestowed much good land for augmenting the revenew of the same"  Godwin SUCCESS BISHO  S pag edit ut supr And Leland speaks much to the same purpose  "Hic Carpenter ex veteri collegio quod erat Westberiae novum fecit et praediis auxit addito pinnato muro porta et turribus instar castelli"  ITIN vol viii fol a And hence it appears to be a mistake that Cannynge who was indeed dean while these benefactions took place rebuilt the college As Dugd WARWICKSH p edit Atkyns GLOUCESTERSH p supr citat p    Very few anecdotes of Rowlie's life have descended to posterity The following MEMOIRS of his life are said to have been written by himself in the year and to have been discovered with his poetry which perhaps to many readers will appear equally spurious  I was fadre confessour to masteres Roberte and mastre William Cannings Mastre Roberte was a man after his fadre's own harte greedie of gaynes and sparying of alms deedes but master William was mickle courteous and gave me many marks in my needs At the age of twentytwo years deceasd master Roberte and by master William's desyre  bequeathd me one hundred marks I went to thank master  William for his mickle courtesie and to make tender of my selfe to himFadre quod he I have a crotchett in my brayne that will need your aide Master William said I if you command me I will go to Roome for you not so farr distant said he I ken you for a mickle learnd priest if you will leave the parysh of our ladie and travel for mee it shall be mickle to your profits  I gave my hands and he told mee I must goe to all the abbies and pryorys and gather together auncient drawyings  I much doubt if this word now existed in the modern or any sense Indeed the phrase  to draw a picture  might have been now known but to  draw  in its present uncombined use had not yet acquired this meaning So late as the reign of James the first a Painter was often called a  picturedrawer  In antient inventories of furniture a  drawing  never occurs as any species of production of the art of designing it became a technical and distinguishing term when that art began to attain some degree of maturity  Pictures  although this word is now confined to a precise signification would not have been improper here Yet the word  Picture  was not antiently used in its present sense and manner but a  picture with a cloth a table with a picture  c  if of anie account at any price Consented I to the same and pursuant sett out the Mundaie following for the minster of our ladie  I suppose Worcester cathedral  and Saint Goodwyne where a drawing of a steeple

below  "the Saxon  manuscript    "  These at this time would have been called  books  in Saxonne but I was onley to bargayne for drawyngsThe next drawyings I metten with was a church to be reard so as

Peterburrow sold it me he might have bargaynd twenty marks better but master William would not depart with it The prior of Coventree did sell me a picture of great account made by Badilian Y'allyanne who did lyve in the rayne of kyng Henrie the first a mann of fickle temper havyng been tendred syx pounds of silver for it to which he said naie and afterwards did give it to the then abott  This should have been  Prior  An  abbot  was never the title of the superiour in cathedralconvents The PRIOR OF COVENTRY must have been a dignitary wellknown by that name as he sate in parliament  of Coventriee In brief I gathered together manie marks value of fine drawyings all the works of mickle cunningMaster William culld the most choise parts but hearing of a drawying in Durham church hee did send me  Fadree you have done mickle well all the chatills are more worth than you gave take this for your paynes so saying he did put into my hands a purse of two hundreds good pounds and did say that I should note be in need I did thank him most heartilyThe choise drawyng when  his fadre did dye was begunn to be put up and somme houses neer the old church erased it was drawn by Aflema preest of Saint Cutchburts and offerd as a drawyng for Westminster but cast asyde being the tender did not speak French  I had now mickle of ryches and lyvd in a house on the hyll often repayrings to mastere William who was now lord of the house I sent him my verses touching his church for which he did send me mickle good things  In the year kyng Edward came to Bristow Master Cannings send for me to avoid a marriage which the kyng was bent upon between him and a ladie he neer had seen of the familee of the Winddivilles the danger where nigh unless avoided by one remidee an holie one which was to be

Edward who was so furiously madd and ravyngs withall that master Cannings was wyling to give him three thousand markes which made him peace again and he was admyted to the presence of the kyng staid in Bristow partook of all his pleasures and pastimes till he departed the next year  See above p    I gave master Cannings my Bristow tragedy  That is the poem called the EXECUTION OF SIR CHARLES BAWDWIN mentioned above p What is there said concerning this poem greatly invalidates the authenticity of these MEMOIRS Rowlie might indeed write a poem on this subject but not the poem circulated as his  for which he gave me in hands twentie pound and did praise it more then I did think my self did deserve for I can say in troth I was never proud of my verses since I did read master Chaucer and now haveing nought to do and not wyling to be  ydle I went to the minster of our Ladie and Saint Goodwin and then did purchase the Saxon manuscripts and sett my self diligently to translate and worde it in English metre which in one year I performd and settled in the Battle of Hastyngs master William did bargyin for one to be manuscript and John Pelham an esquire of Ashley for anotherMaster William did praise it muckle greatly but advisd me to tender it to no man beying the mann whose name where therein mentioned would be offended He gave me twenty markes and I did goe to Ashley to master Pelham to be payd of him for the other one I left with him  But his ladie being of the family of the Fiscamps  A Norman family  of whom some things are said he told me he had burnt it and would have me burnt too if I did not avaunt Dureing this dinn his wife did come out and made a dinn to speake by a figure would have over sounded the bells of our Ladie of the Cliffe I was fain content to gett away in a safe skin  I wrote my Justice of Peace  I know nothing of this piece  which master Cannings advisd me secrett to keep which I did and now being grown auncient I was seizd with great pains which did cost me mickle of marks to be cured offMaster William offered me a cannon's place in Westbury collige which gladly had I accepted but my pains made me to staie at home After this mischance I livd in a house by the Tower which has not been repaird since Robert Consull of Gloucester repayrd the castle and wall here I livd warm but in my house on the hyll the ayre was mickle keen some marks it cost me to put it in repair my new house and brynging my chattles from the ould it was a fine house and I much marville it was untenanted A person greedy of gains was the then possessour and of him I did buy it at a very small rate having lookd on the ground works and mayne supports  and fynding them staunch and repayrs no need wanting I did buy of the owner Geoffry Coombe on a  repayring lease  for ninetynine years  I very much question whether this technical lawterm or even this mode of contract existed in the year  he thinkying it would fall down everie day but with a few marks expence did put it up in a manner neat and therein I lyvd  It is with regret that I find myself obliged to pronounce Rowlie's poems to be spurious Antient remains of English poetry unexpectedly discovered and fortunately rescued from a long oblivion are contemplated with a degree of fond enthusiasm exclusive of any real or intrinsic excellence they afford those pleasures arising from the idea of antiquity which deeply interest the imagination With these pleasures we are unwilling to part But there is a more solid satisfaction resulting from the detection of artifice and imposture  SECT IX  THE subsequent reigns of Richard the third Edward the fifth and Henry the seventh abounded in obscure versifiers  A mutilated poem which occurs among the Cotton manuscripts in the British museum and principally contains a satire on the nuns who not less from the nature of their establishment than from the usual degeneracy which attends all institutions had at length lost their original purity seems to belong to this period  Disadvantageous suspicions against the chastity of the female religious were  pretended  in earlier times About the year a bishop of Lincoln visited the nunneries of his diocese on which occasion says the continuator of Matthew Paris  "ad domos religiosarum veniens fecit EXPRIMI MAMILLAS earundem ut sic  physice  si esset inter eas corruptela

here mentioned because the second of these treatises is written in rhyme It is spoken in her own person in which being otherwise a woman of authority she assumes the title of dame I suspect the whole

college Oxford about the year He had many dignities in the church He was patronised by Humphrey duke of Glocester to whom he dedicates his book This I ought to have remarked before    To this period I refer William of Nassyngton a proctor or advocate in the ecclesiastical court at York He translated into English rhymes as I conjecture about the year a theological tract entitled  A treatise on the Trinity and Unity with a declaration of God's Works and of the Passion of Jesus Christ  written by John of Waldenby an Augustine  frier of Yorkshire a student in the Augustine convent at Oxford the provincial of his order in England and a strenuous champion against the doctrines of Wiccliffe  Wood  Ant Univ Oxon i  I once saw a manuscript of Nassyngton's translation in the library of Lincoln cathedral  See also MSS Reg C viii p  and was tempted to transcribe the few following lines from the prologue as they convey an idea of our poet's character record the titles of some old popular

 Ne of syr GYE OF WARWYKE c  Our translator in these verses formally declares his intention of giving his reader no entertainment and disavows all concern with secular vanities especially those unedifying tales of love and arms which were the customary themes of other poets and the delight of an idle age The romances of OCTAVIAN sir BEVIS and sir GUY have already been discussed at large That of sir ISEMBRAS was familiar in the time of Chaucer and occurs in the RIME of SIR THOPAS  V See supr vol i p Notes  In Mr Garrick's curious library of chivalry which his friends share in common with himself there is an edition  by Copland extremely different from the manuscript copies preserved at Cambridge  MSS Caius Coll Class A  and in the Cotton collection  CALIG A f  I believe it to be originally a French romance yet not of very high antiquity It is written in the stanza of Chaucer's sir THOPAS  See Percy's BALL i  The incidents are for the most part those trite expedients which almost constantly form the plan of these metrical narratives  I take this opportunity of remarking that the MINSTRELS who in this prologue of Nassyngton are named separately from the GESTOURS or taletellers were sometimes distinguished from the harpers In the year six Minstrels accompanied with four Harpers on the anniversary of Alwyne the bishop  performed  their  minstrelsies  at dinner in the hall of the convent of saint Swithin at Winchester and during supper sung the same GEST or tale in the great  arched  chamber of the prior on which solemn occasion the said chamber was hung with the arras or tapestry of THE THREE KINGS OF COLOGNE  Registr Priorat S Swithini Winton ut supr vol i p  "In festo Alwyni episcopi Et durante pietancia in aulâ conventûs sex MINISTRALLI cum quatuor

for the year there is an entry  For setting up  ROBIN HOODES BOWER I suppose for a parish interlude ARCHAEOL vol i p  These minstrels and harpers belonged partly to the royal houshold in Winchester castle and partly to the bishop of Winchester  There was an annual mass at the shrine or tomb of bishop Alwyne in the church which was regularly followed by a feast in the convent It is probable that the GEST here specified was some poetical legend of the prelate to whose memory this yearly festival was instituted and who was a Saxon bishop of Winchester about the year  He is buried in the north wall of the presbytery with an inscription  Although songs of chivalry were equally common and I believe more welcome to the monks at these solemnities In an accomptroll of the priory of Bicester in

Latin at fol  In Chaucer's MILLER'S TALE we have this passage v  Hast thou not herd quod Nicholas also  The sorwe of Noe with his felawship  Or that he might get his wif to ship  I know not whether this anecdote about Noah is in any similar supposititious book of Genesis It occurs however in the  Chester Whitsun Playes  where the authors according to the established indulgence allowed to dramatic poets perhaps thought themselves at liberty to enlarge on the sacred story MSS Harl This altercation between Noah and his wife takes up almost the whole third  pageaunt  of these interludes Noah having reproached his wife for her usual frowardness of temper at last conjures her to come on board the ark for fear of drowning His wife insists on his sailing without her and swears by  Christ  and  saint John  that she will not embark till some of her old female comp  nions are ready to go with her She adds that if he is in such a hurry he may sail alone and fetch himself a new wife At length Shem with the help of his brothers forces her into the vessel and while Noah very cordially welcomes her on board she gives him a box on the ear  There is an apocryphal book of the expulsion of Adam from Paradise and of Seth's pilgrimage to Paradise c c MSS Eccles Cathedr Winton  His fabulous origin of Chester is not  so much to be imputed to his own want of veracity as to the authority of his voucher Ranulph Higden a celebrated chronicler his countryman and a monk of his own abbey  There is the greatest probability that RALPH HIGDEN hitherto known as a grave historian and theologist was the compiler of the  Chesterplays  mentioned above vol i p In one of the Harleian copies under the  Proclamation  for performing these plays in the year this note occurs in the hand of the third Randal Holme one of the Chester antiquaries  "Sir John Arnway was mayor A D and At which tyme these playes were written by RANDALL HIGGENET a monke of Chester abbey c"  In a Prologue to these plays when they were presented in the year are these lines ibid  That some tymes ther was mayor of this citie  Sir John Arnway knight who most worthilie  Contented hymselfe to sett out in  playe  The  Devise  of  one Done  RONDALL Moonke of Chester abbaye  Done Rondall  is  Dan  dominus  Randal  In another of the Harleian copies of these plays written in the year this note appears seemingly written in the year MSS Harl  "The Whitsun playes fir  t made by one  Don Rondle Heggenet  a monke of Chester abbey who was thrise at Rome before he could obtaine leave of the pope to have them in the English tongue"  Our chronicler's name in the text sometimes written  Hikeden  and  Higgeden  was easily corrupted into  Higgenet  or  Heggenet  and  Randa  is Ranulph or Randolph  Ralph  He died having been a monk of Chester abbey sixtyfour years in the year In PIERS PLOWMAN a frier says that he is well acquainted with the  "  rimes  of RANDALL OF CHESTER"  fol edit I take this pass  ge to allude to this very person and to his compositions of this kind for which he was probably soon famous In an anonymous CHRONICON he is styled  Ranulphus Cestrensis  which is nothing more than RANDALL OF CHESTER MS Ric James xi Bibl Bodl And again we have RANULPHI CESTRENSIS  "ars componendi sermone  "  MSS Bodl sup N Art And in many other places  By the way if it be true that these MYSTERIES were composed in the year and there was so much difficulty in obtaining the pope's permission that they might be presented in English a presumptive proof arises that all our MYSTERIES before that period were in Latin These plays will therefore have the merit of being the first English interludes  He supposes that Chester called by the antient Britons CAIR  LLEON or  the city of Legions  was founded by Leon Gaur a giant corrupted from LEON VAUR or the  great legion  The founder of this citie as sayth Polychronicon  Was Leon Gaur a myghte stronge gyaunt  Which buildid caves and dongeons manie a one  No goodlie buildyng ne proper ne pleasant  He adds with an equal attention to etymology  But kinge Leir a Britan fine and valiaunt  Was founder of Chester by pleasaunt buildyng  And was named Guar Leir by the kyng  Lib ii c iii    But a greater degree of credulity would perhaps have afforded him a better claim to the character of a poet and at least we should have conceived a more advantageous opinion of his imagination had he been less frugal of those traditionary fables in which ignorance and superstition had cloathed every part of his argument This piece was first printed by Pinson in the year

over England the lives miracles and GESTS of the saints of both sexes which he reduced into prosehistories  Cap x Vit Ethel  The words of the Latin deserve our attention  "In historiis in  prosa  dictando mutavit"  Hence we may perhaps infer  that they were not before in prose and that he took the  from old metrical legends this is a presumptive proof that the lives of the saints were at first extant in verse In the same light we are to understand the words which i  diately follow  "Hic scripsit  Prosam  sanctae Etheld  ae  Which is extant in this Ely register and contains heads  "  Where the  Prose  of saint Etheldred is opposed to her  poetical  legend  And these improved prosenarratives were often turned back again into verse even so late as in the age before us to which among others I could mention we may refer the legend of Saint Eustathius MSS Cotton CALIG A  Seynt  Eustace  a nobull knyʒte  Of hethen law he was  And ere than he crystened was  Mene callyd him  Placidas  He was with  Trajan  themperor c  A Latin legend on this saint is in MSS Harl  Concerning legendmakers there is a curious story in MSS James xxxi p ad ITER LANCASTR num vol Bibl Bodl Gilbert de Stone a learned ecclesiastic who flourished about the year was soli  ed by the monks of Holywell in Flintshire to write the life of their patron saint Stone applying to these monks for materials was answe  ed that they had none in their monastery  Upon which he declared that he could  ute the work just as easily without any  terials at all and that he would write them a most excellent legend after the  manner  of the legend of Thomas a Becket He has the character of an elegant Latin writer and seems to have done the same piece of service perhaps in the same way to other religious houses From his EPISTLES it appears that he wrote the life of saint  Wolfade  patron of the priory of canons regular of his native town of Stone in Staffordshire which he dedicated to the prior William de Madely Epist iii dat MSS Bibl Bodl Sup D i Art He was Latin secretary to several bishops and could possibly write a legend or a letter with equal facility His epistles are in number The first of them in which he is stiled  chancellour to the bishop of Winchester  is to the archbishop of Canterbury That is  secretary  MSS Cotton VITELL E x This bishop of Winchester must have been William of Wykeham  The most extraordinary composition of this kind if we consider among other circumstances that it was compiled at a time when knowledge and literature had made some progress and when mankind were so much less disposed to believe or to invent miracles more especially when the subject was quite recent is the LEGEND of KING HENRY the SIXTH It is entitled  De  MIRACULIS  beatissimi illius Militis Christi Henrici sexti etc  That it might properly rank with other legends it was translated from an English copy into Latin by one Johannes styled  Pauperculus  a monk about the year at the command of John Morgan dean of Windsor afterwards bishop of saint David's It is divided into two books to both of which prefaces are prefixed containing proofs of the miracles wrought by this pious monarch At the beginning there is a hymn with a prayer addressed to the royal saint fol  Salve miles preciose  Rex Henrice generose c  Henry could not have been a complete saint without his legend MSS Harl And MSS Reg C What shall we think of the judgment and abilities of the dignified ecclesiastic who could seriously patronise so ridiculous a narrative  By  mutavit dictando  we are to understand that he  translated  or  reformed  or in the most general sense  wrote anew in Latin  these antiquated lives His principal objects were the more recent saints especially those of this island Malmesbury says  "Innumeras SANCTORUM VITAS RECENTIUM  stylo extulit  veterum vel amissas vel  informiter editas  comptius  renovavit  Hist Angl lib iv p  "  In this respect the labours of Goscelin partly resembled those of Symeon Metaphrastes a celebrated Constantinopolitan writer of the tenth century who obtained the distinguishing appellation of the METAPHRAST  because at the command and under the auspices of Constantine Porphyrogenitus he modernised the more antient narratives of the miracles and martyrdoms of the most eminent eastern and western saints for the use of the Greek church or rather digested from detached imperfect or obsolete books on the subject a new and more commodious body of the sacred biography  Among the many striking contrasts between the manners and characters of antient and modern life which these annals present we must not be surprised to find a mercer a sheriff and an alderman of London descending from his important occupations to write verses This is Robert Fabyan who yet is generally better known as an historian than as a poet He was esteemed not only the most facetious but the most learned of all the mercers sheriffs and aldermen of his time and no layman of that age is said to have been better skilled in the Latin language He flourished about the year In his CHRONICLE or  Concordance of histories  from Brutus to the year it is his usual practice at the division of the books to insert metrical prologues and other pieces in verse The best of his metres is the COMPLAINT of king Edward the second who like the personages in Boccacio's FALL OF PRINCES is very dramatically introduced reciting his own misfortunes  Fol tom ii edit See Hearne's Lib Nig Scacc p And Praefat p xxxviii Fabyan says  "they are reported to be his own makynge in the tyme of his emprysonment"  ibid By the way there is a passage in this chronicler which points out the true reading of a controverted passage in Shakespeare  "Also children were christened thorough all the land and menne  houseled and anealed  excepte suche c"  tom ii p col  But th  soliloquy is nothing more than a translation from a short and a very poor Latin poem attributed to that monarch but probably written by William of Wyrcester which is preserved among the manuscripts of the college of arms and entitled  Lamentatio gloriosi regis Edvardi de Karnarvon quam edidit tempore suae incarcerationis  Our author's transitions  from prose to verse in the course of a prolix narrative seem to be made with much ease and when he begins to versify the historian disappears only by the addition of rhyme and stanza In the first edition of his CHRONICLE by way of epilogues to his seven books he has given us  The seven joys of the Blessed Virgin in English Rime  And under the year there is a poem to the virgin and another on one Badby a Lollard under the year  Edit  ond fol  These are suppressed in the later editions He has likewise left a panegyric on the city of London but despairs of doing justice to so noble a subject for verse even if he had the eloquence of Tully the morality of Seneca and the harmony of that  faire Lady  Calliope  Fol tom ii ut supr  The reader will thank me for citing only one stanza from king Edward's COMPLAINT  When Saturne with his cold and isye face  The ground with his frostes turneth grene to white  The time winter which treès doth deface  And causeth all verdure

subject and in the same stanza MSS Harl to The ghost of Edward the second as here is introduced speaking It is addressed to queen Elizabeth as appears among other passages from st It begins thus  Whi  should a wasted spirit spent in woe  Disclose the wounds receyved within his brest  It is imperfect having only stanzas Then follows the same poem with many alterations additions and omissions This i  addressed to James the first as appears from st c It contains stanzas There is another copy in the same library Num At the end the poet calls himself INFORTUNIO This is an appellation which I think Spenser sometimes assumed But Spenser was dead before the reign of James nor has this piece any of Spenser's characteristic merit It begins thus  I sing thy s  d disaster fatal king  Carnarvon Edward second of that name  The poem on this subject in the addition to the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES by William Niccols is a different composition A WINTER NIGHT'S VISION Lond p These two manuscript poems deserve no further mention nor would they have been mentioned at all but from their reference to the text and on account of their subject Compare MSS Harl fol An unfinished poem on Edward the second perhaps by Lydgate Princ  "Beholde this greate prince Edward the secunde"    As an historian our author is the dullest of compilers He is equally attentive to the succession of the mayors of London and of the monarchs of England and seems to have thought the dinners at guildhall and the pageantries of the citycompanies more interesting transactions than our victories in France and our struggles for public liberty at home One of Fabyan's historical anecdotes under the important reign of Henry the fifth is that a new weathercock was placed on the cross of Saint Paul's steeple It is said that cardinal Wolsey commanded many copies of this chronicle to be committed to the flames because it made too ample a discovery of the excessive revenues of the clergy The earlier chapters of these childish annals faithfully record all those fabulous traditions which generally supply the place of historic monuments in describing the origin of a great nation  Another poet of this period is John Watson a priest He wrote a Latin theological tract entitled SPECULUM CHRISTIANI which is a sort of paraphrase on the decalogue and the creed  MSS C C C Oxon MSS Laud G MSS Thoresb There is an abridgement of this work MSS Harl with the date This is rather beyond the period with which we are at present engaged  But it is interspersed with a great number of wretched English rhymes among which is the following hymn to the virgin Mary  Compare a hymn to the holy virgin supr vol i p Mathew Paris relates that Godrich a hermit about the year who lived in a solitary wild on the banks of the river Ware near Durham had a vision in his oratory of the virgin Mary who taught him this song  Seint Marie clane virgine  Moder Jesu Christe Nazarine  On so scild thir Godrich  On  ang bringe haeli

are unmentioned by Bale v And Pitts p  Autogr in pergamen  Pierre de Corbian a troubadour has left a hymn or prayer to the holy virgin which he says he chose to compose in the romance  language because he could write it more  intelligibly  than Latin Another troubadour a mendicant frier of the thirteenth century had worked himself up into such a pitch of enthusiasm concerning the holy virgin that he became deeply  in love  with her It is partly owing as I have already hinted to the gallantry of the dark ages in which the female sex was treated with so romantic a respect that the virgin Mary received such exaggerated honours and was so distinguished an object of adoration in the devotion of those times    Mary Moder wel thou be  Mary Moder thenke on mee  Mayden and moder was never

frequently decorates his books has left a poem of considerable length entitled the WORKE OF SAPIENCE  Printed by him without date fol in thirtyseven leaves  It comprehends not only an allegorical fiction concerning the two courts of the castle of Sapience in which there is no imagination but a system of natural philosophy grammar logic rhetoric geometry astronomy theology and other  topics of the fashionable literature Caxton appears to be the author by the prologue yet it is not improbable that he might on this occasion employ some professed versifier at least as an assistant to prepare a new book of original poetry for his press The writer's design is to describe the effects of wisdom from the beginning of the world and the work is a history of knowledge or learning In a vision he meets the goddess SAPIENCE in a delightful meadow who conducts him to her castle or mansion and there displays all her miraculous operations Caxton in the poem invokes the  gylted goddess  and  moost facundyous lady  Clio apologises to those  makers  who delight in  termes gay  for the inelegancies of language which as a foreigner he could not avoid and modestly declares that he neither means to rival or envy Gower and Chaucer  Among the anonymous pieces of poetry belonging to this period which are very numerous the most conspicuous is the KALENDAR OF SHEPHERDS It seems to have been translated into English about the year from a French book entitled KALENDRIER DES BERGERS  I have seen an edition of the French of  It was printed by Wynkyn de Worde in the year  I have an edition printed by John Wally at London without date to In the prolog  e it is said  "This book was first corruptly printed in France and after that at the cost and charges of Richard Pinson newly translated and  eprinted although not so faithfully as the original copy required c"  It was certainly first printed by de Worde Again ch ii  "From the yeare this kalender was made M CCCC XCVII unto the yeare M CCCCC XVI"  From whence I conclude that Worde's edition was in Wally's in Again  "This yeare of the present kalender whiche began to have course the first daye of January M CCCC XCVII"  This piece was calculated for the purposes of a perpetual almanac and seems to have been the universal magazine of every article of salutary and useful knowledge It is a medley of verse and prose and contains among many other curious particulars the saints of the whole year the moveable feasts the signs of the zodiac the properties of the twelve months rules  for bloodletting a collection of proverbs a system of ethics politics divinity phisiognomy medicine astrology and geography  Pieces of this sort were not uncommon In the British museum there is an ASTROLOGICAL poem teaching when to buy and sell to let blood to build to go to sea the fortune of children the interpretation of dreams with other like important particulars from the day of the moon's age MSS Harl fol In the principal letter the author is

of our KALENDER are described the seven visions or the punishments in hell of the seven deadly sins which Lazarus saw between his death and resurrection These punishments are imagined with great strength of fancy and accompanied with wooden cuts boldly touched and which the printer Wynkyn de Worde probably procured from some German engraver at the infancy of the art  Compare the torments of Dante's hell INFERN Cant v vi seq  The PROUD are bound by hooks of iron to vast wheels like mills placed between craggy precipices which are incessantly whirling with the most violent impetuosity and sound like thunder The ENVIOUS are plunged in a lake half frozen from which as they attempt to emerge for ease their naked limbs are instantly smote with a blast of such intolerable keenness that they are compelled to dive again into the lake To the WRATHFULL is assigned a gloomy cavern in which their bodies are butchered and their limbs mangled  by demons with various weapons The SLOTHFULL are tormented in a  horrible hall dark and tenebrous  swarming with innum  rable flying serpents of various shapes and sizes which sting to the heart This I think is the Hell of the Gothic EDDA The COVETOUS are dipped in cauldrons filled with boiling metals The GLUTTONOUS are placed in a vale near a loathsome pool abounding with venomous creatures on whose banks tables are spread from which they are perpetually crammed with toads by devils CONCUPISCENCE is punished in a field full of immense pits or wells overflowing with fire and sulphur This visionary scene of the infernal punishments seems to be borrowed from a legend related by Matthew Paris under the reign of king John in which the soul of one Thurkhill a native of Tidstude in Essex is conveyed by saint Julian from his body when laid asleep into hell and heaven In hell he has a sight of the torments of the damned which are presented under the form and name of the INFERNAL PAGEANTS and greatly resemble the fictions I have just described Among the tormented is a knight who had passed his life in shedding much innocent blood at tilts and tournaments He is introduced compleatly armed on horseback and couches his lance against the demon who is commissioned to seize and to drag him to his eternal destiny There is likewise a priest who never said mass and a baron of the exchequer who took bribes Turkill is then conducted into the mansions of the blessed which are painted with strong oriental colouring and in Paradise a garden replenished with the most delicious fruits and the most exquisite variety of trees plants and flowers he sees Adam a personage of gigantic proportion but the most beautiful symmetry reclined on the side of a fountain which sent forth four streams of different water and colour and under the shade of a tree of immense size and height laden with fruits of every kind and breathing the richest odours Afterwards saint Julian conveys the soul of Turkhill back to  his body and when awakened he relates this vision to his parishpriest  Matt Paris Hist pag seq E  it Tig Much the same sort of fable is related ibid p seq There is an old poem on this subject called OWAYNE MILES MSS COTT CALIG A f

pageants of this period were much improved and beginning now to be celebrated with new splendour received among other advantages the addition of SPEAKING PERSONAGES These spectacles thus furnished with speakers characteristically habited and accompanied with proper scenery cooperated with the MYSTERIES of whose nature they partook at first in introducing the drama It was customary to prepare these shews at the reception of a prince or any other solemnity of a similar kind and they were presented on moveable theatres or occasional stages erected in the streets The speeches were in verse and as the procession moved forward the speakers who constantly bore some allusion to the ceremony either conversed together in the form of a dialogue or addressed the noble person whose presence occasioned the celebrity Speakers seem to have been admitted into our pageants about the reign of Henry the sixth  In the year when Henry the sixth after his coronation at Paris made a triumphal entry into London many stanzas very probably written by Lydgate were addressed to his majesty amidst a series of the most splendid allegorical spectacles by a giant representing religious fortitude Enoch

prohibit all clerks from playing in the Mysteries  even on  CORPUS CHRISTIDAY  "Neque in Comoediis personam agat  etiam in  FESTO CORPORIS CHRISTI"  SACROSANCT CONCIL fol per Labb tom xv p edit Paris  were employed in the management of these devises and that the Coventry men were famous for the arts of exhibition appears from the share they took in the gallant entertainment of queen Elisabeth at Kenelworthcastle before whom they played their  old storial show  See supr vol i p    At length personages of another cast were added and this species of spectacle about the period with which we are  concerned was enlivened by the admission of new characters drawn either from profane history or from profane allegory  Profane allegory however had been applied in pageants somewhat earlier In the pageants abovementioned presented to Henry the sixth the seven liberal sciences personi  ed are introduced in a  tabernacle of curious worke  from which their queen  dame Sapience  speaks verses At entering the city he is met and faluted in metre by three ladies  richly cladde in golde and silkes  with coronets who suddenly issue from a stately tower hung with the most splendid arras These are the Dames NATURE GRACE and FORTUNE Fabyan ut supr fol seq But this is a rare instance so early  in the application of which some degree of learning and invention appeared  I have observed in a former work and it is a topic which will again be considered in its proper place that the frequent and familiar use of allegoric personifications in the public pageants I mean the general use of them greatly contributed to form the school of Spenser  See Obs FAIRY QUEEN ii  But moreover from what is here said it seems probable that the PAGEAUNTS which being shewn on civil occasions derived great part of their decorations and actors from historical fact and consequently made profane characters the subject of public exhibition dictated ideas of a regular drama much sooner than the MYSTERIES which being confined to scripture stories or rather the legendary miracles of sainted martyrs and the no less ideal personifications of the christian virtues were not calculated to make so quick and easy a transition to the representations of real life and rational action  In the year when the princess Catharine of Spain came to London to be married to prince Arthur her procession through the city was very magnificent The pageants were numerous and superbly furnished in which the principal actors or speakers were not only God the father saint Catharine and saint Ursula but king Alphonsus the astronomer and an ancestor of the princess a Senator an Angel Job Boethius Nobility and Virtue These personages sustained a sort of action at least of dialogue The  lady was compared to Hesperus and the prince to Arcturus and Alphonsus from his skill in the stars was introduced to be the fortuneteller of the match  Chron MS  These machineries were contrived and directed by an ecclesiastic of great eminence bishop Fox who says Bacon  "was not only a grave counsellor for war or peace but also a good surveyor of works and a good master of ceremonies and any thing else that was fit for the active part belonging to the service of court or state of a great king"  It is probable that this prelate's dexterity and address in the conduct of a courtrareeshow procured him more interest than the gravity of his counsels and the depth of his political knowledge at least his employment in this business presents a striking picture of the importance of those popular talents which even in an age of blind devotion and in the reign of a superstitious monarch were instrumental in paving the way to the most opulent dignities of the church  "Whosoever adds the same penetrating historian had these toys in compiling they were not altogether PEDANTICAL  Bacon's HENRY THE SEVENTH COMPL Hist Engl vol i p  "  About the year Henry the seventh went a progress into the north and at every place of distinction was received with a pageant in which he was saluted in a poetical oration not always religious as at York by Ebranck a British king and the founder of the city as well as by the holy virgin and king David at Worcester by Henry the sixth his uncle at Hereford by saint George and king Ethelbert at entering the cathedral there at Bristol by king Bremmius Prudence and Justice The two latter characters were personated by young girls  From a manuscript in the Cotton library printed in Leland COLLECTAN ad calc vol iii p    In the mean time it is to be granted that profane characters were personated in our pageants before the close of the fourteenth century Stowe relates that in the year  for the entertainment of the young prince Richard son of Edward the black prince one hundred and thirty citizens rode disguised from Newgate to Kennington where the court resided attended with an innumerable multitude of waxen torches and various instruments of music in the evening of the Sunday preceding Candlemasday In the first rank were fortyeight habited like esquires with visors and in the second the same number in the character of knights  "Then followed one richly arrayed like an EMPEROR and after him at some distance one statelytyred like a POPE whom followed twentyfour CARDINALLS and after them eyght or tenne with blacke visors not amiable as if they had been LEGATES from some forrain princes"  But this parade was nothing more than a DUMB SHEW unaccompanied with any kind of interlocution This appears from what follows For our chronicler adds that when they entered the hall of the palace they were met by the prince the queen and the lords  "whom the said mummers did salute  shewing by a pair of dice their desire to play with the prince  "  which they managed with so much complaisance and skill that the prince won of them a bowl a cup and a ring of gold and the queen and lords each a ring of gold Afterwards having been feasted with a sumptuous banquet they had the honour of dancing with the young prince and the nobility and so the ceremony was concluded  Stowe's SURV LOND pag edit to It will perhaps be said that this shew was not properly a PAGEANT but a MUMMERY But these are frivolous distinctions and taken in a general view this account preserves a curious specimen of early PERSONATION and proves at least that the practice was not then in its infancy  Matthew Paris informs us that at the magnificent marriage of Henry the third with Eleanor of Provence in the year certain strange pageants and wonderful devises were displayed in the city of London and that the number of HISTRIONES on this occasion was infinite  I will cite the passage more at large and in the words of the original  "Convenerunt autem vocata ad convivium nuptiale tanta nobilium multitudo utriusque sexus tanta religiosorum numerositas tanta plebium populositas tanta HISTRIONUM  Varietas  quod vix eos civitas Londoniarum sinu suo capaci comprehenderet Ornata est

Varietas  histrionum plainly implies the comprehensive and general meaning of the word HISTRIO and the multi  arious performances of that order of men Yet in the Injunctions given by the Barons to the religious houses in the year there is an article which seems to shew that the Histriones were sometimes a  particular  species of public entertainers  "HISTRIONUM LUDI non  videantur  vel  audiantur

cannot omit the opportunity of adding a striking instance of the extraordinary freedom of speech permitted to these people at the most solemn celebrities About the year king Henry the third passing some time in France held a most magnificent feast in the great hall of the knightstemplars at Paris at which beside his own suite were present the kings of France and Navarre and all the nobility of France The walls of the hall were hung all over with shields among which was that of our king Richard the first Just before the feast began a JOCULATOR or minstrel accosted king Henry thus  "My lord why did you invite so many Frenchmen to feast with you in this hall Behold there is the shield of Richard the magnanimous king of EnglandAll the Frenchmen present will eat their dinner in f  r and trembling"  Matt Paris p sub HENR iii edit Tigur fol Whether this was a preconcerted compliment previously suggested by the king of France or not it is equally a proof of the familiarity with which the minstrels were allowed to address the most eminent personages    But the word HISTRIO in the Latin writers of the barbarous ages  There is a passage in John of Salisbury much to our purpose which I am obliged to give in Latin  "At eam desidiam nostris prorogant HISTRIONES Admissa sunt ergo SPECTACULA et infinita lenocinia vanitatisHinc  mimi salii vel saliares balatroues aemil  ani gladiatores

perhaps of much higher antiquity In the year while Henry the seventh kept his residence at the castle at Winchester on occasion of the birth of prince Arthur on a sunday during the time of dinner he was entertained with a religious drama called CHRISTI DESCENSUS AD INFEROS or  Christ's descent into hell  Registr Priorat S Swithin Winton MS ut supr  It was represented by the PUERI ELEEMOSYNARII or choirboys of Hyde abbey and saint Swithin's priory two large monasteries at Winchester This is the only proof I have ever seen of choirboys acting in the old MYSTERIES nor  do I recollect any other instance of a royal dinner even on a festival accompanied with this species of diversion  Except that on the first Sunday of the magnificent marriage of king James of Scotland with the princess Margaret of England daughter of Henry the seventh celebrated at Edinburgh with high splendour  "after dynnar a MORALITE was played by the said master Inglyshe and hys companyons in the presence of the

apocryphal narratives containing infinite innovations of the evangelical history and forged at Constantinople  the early writers of the Greek church gave birth to an  ndless variety of legends concerning the life of Christ and his apostles  In the manuscript register of saint Swithin's priory at Winchester it is recorded that Leofric bishop of Exeter about the year gave to the convent a book called GESTA  Beatissimi Apostoli Petri cum Glosa  This is probably one of these commentitious histories By the way the same Leofric was a great benefactor in books to his church at Exeter Among others he gave  Boetii Liber  ANGLICUS and  Magnus liber  ANGLICUS  omnino  METRICE  descriptus  What was this translation of Boethius I know not unless it is Alfred's It is still more difficult to determine what was the other piece the GREAT BOOK OF ENGLISH VERSE at so early a period The grant is in Saxon and if not genuine must be of high antiquity Dugdal MONAST tom i p I have given Dugdale's Latin translation The Saxon words are  "Boeties boc on engliscAnd mycel englisc boc be gehƿilcum þingum on leodþisan geƿoƿht"  and which in the barbarous  ages was better esteemed than the genuine gospel on account of its improbabilities and absurdities  But whatever was the source of these exhibitions they were thought to contribute so much to the information and instruction of the people on the most important subjects of religion that one of the popes granted a pardon of one thousand days to every person who resorted peaceably to the plays performed in the Whitsun week at Chester beginning with the creation and ending with the general judgment and this indulgence was seconded by the bishop of the diocese who granted forty days of pa  on the pope at the same time denouncing the sentence of damnation on all those incorrigible sinners who presumed to disturb or interrupt the due celebration of these pious sports  MSS Harl  It is certain that they had their use not only in teaching the great truths of scripture to men who could not read the bible but in abolishing the barbarous attachment to military games and the bloody contentions of the tournament which had so long prevailed as the sole species of popular amusement Rude and even ridiculous as they were they softened the manners of the people by diverting the public attention to spectacles in which the mind was concerned and by creating a regard for other arts than those of bodily strength and savage valour  SECT X  THE only writer deserving the name of a poet in the reign of Henry the seventh is Stephen Hawes He was patronised by that monarch who possessed some tincture of literature and is said by Bacon to have confuted a Lollard in a public disputation at Canterbury  LIFE of HENRY vii p edit ut supr One Hodgkins a fellow of King's college in Cambridge and vicar of Ringwood in Hants was eminently skilled in the mathematics and on that account Henry the seventh frequently condescended to visit him at his house at Ringwood Hatcher MS  Catal Pr  pos et Soc Coll Regal Cant    Hawes flourished  out the close of the fifteenth century and was a native of Suffolk  Wood Ath Oxon i  After an academical education at Oxford he travelled much in France and became a complete master of the French and Italian poetry His polite accomplishments quickly procured him an establishment in the houshold of the king who struck with the liveliness of his conversation and because he could repeat by memory most of the old English poets especially Lydgate made him groom of the privy chamber  Bale says that he was called by the king  "ab inter  ori camera ad privatum cubiculum"  Cent viii  His facility in the French tongue was a qualification which might strongly recommend him to the fa  our of Henry the seventh who was fond of studying the best French books then in vogue  Bacon ut supr p    Hawes has left many poems which are now but imperfectly known and scarcely remembered These are the TEMPLE OF GLASSE The CONVERSION OF SWERERS  "The CONVERSYON OF SWERERS made and compyled by Stephen Hawes groome of the chamber of our sovereigne lord kynge Henry vii"  in octave stanzas with Latin lemmata printed by de Worde in  It contains only one sheet in quarto  A JOYFULL MEDITATION OF ALL ENGLOND OR  THE CORONACYON TO OUR MOST NATURAL SOVEREIGN LORD KING HENRY THE EIGTH IN VERSE By the same and without date but probably it was printed soon after the ceremony which it celebrates These coronationcarols were customary There is one by Lydgate  A BALLAD  presented to Henry the sixth the

OF BIRDS Some of the five latter pieces none of which I have seen and which perhaps were never printed are said by Wood to be written in Latin and seem to be in prose  The best of Hawes's poems hitherto enumerated is the TEMPLE OF GLASS  By mistake as it seems I have hither quoted Hawes's TEMPLE of GLASS under the name of Lydgate See supr vol i p It was first printed by Wynken de Worde in  "

"Here lacketh seven leaves that are in Joseph Holland's boke"  This manuscript however contains as much as Berthelett's edition Lewis mentions the  Temple of Glass by John Lydgat    in Caxton's s  cond edition of CHAUCER LIFE CH p See also Middleton's DISSERT p But no such poem appears in that edition in saint John's college library at Oxford  The strongest argument which induces me to give this poem to Hawes and not to Lydgate is that it was printed in Hawes's lifetime with his name by Wynkyn de Worde Bale also mentions among Hawes's poems  Templum Crystallinum  in one book There is however a no less strong argument for giving it to Lydgate and that is from Hawes himself who reciting Lydgate's Works in the PASTIME OF PLEASURE says thus ch xiv edit Signat G iiii ut infr  And the tyme to passe  Of love  he made the bryght  temple of glasse  And I must add that this piece is expressly recited in the large catalogue of Lydgate's works belonging to W Thinne in Speght's edition of Chaucer printed fol Yet on the whole I think this point still doubtful and I leave it to be determined by the reader before whom the evidence on both sides is laid at large  On a comparison it will be found to  be a copy of the HOUSE OF FAME of CHAUCER in which that poet sees in a vision a temple of glass on the walls of which were engraved stories from Virgil's En  id and Ovid's Epistles It also strongly resembles that part of Chaucer's ASSEMBLY OF FOULES in which there is the fiction of a temple of brass built on pillars of jasper whose walls are painted with the stories of unfortunate lovers  V  And in his ASSEMBLY of LADIES in a chamber made of beryl and crystal belonging to the sumptuous castle of  Pleasaunt Regard  the walls are decorated with historical sculptures of the same kind  V  The situation of Hawes's TEMPLE on a craggy rock of ice is evidently taken from that of Chaucer's HOUSE OF FAME In Chaucer's DREAME the poet is transported into an island where  wall and yate was all of glasse  V  These structures of glass have their origin in the chemistry of the dark ages This is Hawes's exordium  Me dyd oppresse a sodayne dedely slepe  Within the whichè methought that I

which appears in this composition entirely belongs to Chaucer Yet there was some merit in daring to depart from the dull taste of the times and in chusing Chaucer for a model after his sublime fancies

this fiction from some of the early romances about Troy  Although perhaps Chaucer might not look further than the temples in Boccacio's THESEID for these ornaments At the same time it is to be remembered that the imagination of these old poets must have been assisted in this respect from the mode which antiently prevailed of entirely covering the walls of the more magnificent apartments in

Hawes's poem I am of opinion that VISIONS which are so common in the poetry of the middle ages partly took their rise from Tully's SOMNIUM SCIPIONIS Had this composition descended to posterity among Tully's six books de REPUBLICA to the last of which it originally belonged perhaps it would have been overlooked and neglected  But they were extant about the year for they are cited by Gerbert Epist And by Peter of Poitou who died in See Barth Advers xxxii Leland says that Tully de REPUBLICA was consumed by fire among other books in the library of William Selling a learned abbot of saint Austin's at Canterbury who died in SCRIPT CELLINGUS  But being preserved and illustrated with a prolix commentary by Macrobius it quickly attracted the attention of readers who were fond of the marvellous and with whom Macrobius was a more admired classic than Tully It was printed subjoined to Tully's OFFICES in the infancy of the typographic art  Venet fol Apud Vindel Spiram  It was translated into Greek by Maximus Planudes  Lambeccius mentions a Greek manuscript of Julian a cardinal of S Angelo  p The DISPUTATIO of Favonius Elogius a Carthaginian rhetorician and a disciple of saint Austin on the SOMNIUM SCIPIONIS was printed by G S  hottus Antw to  and is frequently quoted by Chaucer  ROM ROSE lib i v c  An author that hight MACROBE  That halte not dremis  alse ne lefe  But undoth us the

Particularly in the ASSEMBLY OF FOULES he supposes himself to fall asleep after reading the SOMNIUM SCIPIONIS and that Scipio shewed him the beautiful vision which is the subject of that poem  He makes Scipio say to him v  Thou hast the so wel borne  In looking of mine olde book al to torne  Of which MACROBIE raught not a lite c  Nor is it improbable that not only the form but the first  idea of Dante's INFERNO was suggested by this favourite apologue which in Chaucer's words treats  Of heaven and hell  And yearth and souls that therein dwell  Ibid v    Not to insist on Dante's subject he uses the shade of Virgil for a mystagogue as Tully supposes Scipio to have shewn the other world to his ancestor Africanus  But Hawes's capital performance is a poem entitled  "THE PASSETYME OF PLEASURE or the HISTORIE OF GRAUNDE AMOURE and LA BAL PUCEL contayning the knowledge of the seven sciences and the course of man's lyfe in this worlde Invented by Stephen Hawes groome of kyng Henry the seventh hys chambre  By Wynkyn de Worde in to with wooden cuts A second edition followed in By John Wayland in to A third in to by John Waley in See a poem called a  Dialogue between a Lover and a Jay  by one Thomas Feylde printed by Wynkyn de Worde in to Princ Prol  "Thoug  e laureate poetes in old antiquite"  This obscure rhymer is here only mentioned as he has an  llusion to his cotemporary Hawes  "  It is dedicated to the king and was finished at the beginning of the year  If the poems of Rowlie are not genuine the PASTIME OF PLEASURE is almost the only effort of imagination and invention which had yet appeared in our poetry since Chaucer This poem contains no common touches of romantic and allegoric fiction The personifications are often happily sustained and indicate the writer's familiarity with the Provencial school The model of his versification and phraseology is that improved harmony of numbers and facility of diction with which his predecessor Lydgate adorned our octave stanza But Hawes has added new graces to Lydgate's manner Antony Wood with the zeal of a true antiquary laments that  "such is the fate of poetry that this book which in the time of Henry the seventh and eighth was  taken into the hands of all ingenious men is now thought but worthy of a balladmonger's stall"  The truth is such is the good fortune of poetry and such the improvement of taste that much better books are become fashionable It must indeed be acknowledged that this poem has been unjustly neglected and on that account an apology will be less necessary for giving the reader a circumstantial analysis of its substance and design  GRAUNDE AMOURE the hero of the poem and who speaks in his own person  There is something dramatic in this circumstance Raimond Vidal de Besaudin a troubadour of Provence who flourished about the year has given the following dramatic form to one of his  contes  or tales One day says the troubadour Alphonsus king of Castille whose court was famous for good cheer magnificence loyalty valour the practice of arms and the management of horses held a solemn assembly of minstrels and knights When the hall was quite full came his queen Eleanor covered with a veil and disguised in a close robe bordered with silver adorned with the blason of a golden lion who making obeysance seated herself at some distance from the king At this instant a minstrel advancing to the king addressed him thus  "O king emperour of valour I come to supplicate you to give me audience"  The king under pain of disgrace ordered that no pers  should interrupt the minstrel in what he should say The minstrel had travelled from his own country to recite an adventur  which had happened to a ba  on of Arragon  ot unknown to king Alphonsus and he now proceeds to tell no unaffecting story concerning a jealous husband At the close the minstrel humbly requests the king and queen to banish all jealous husbands from their dominions The king replied  "MINSTREL your tale is pleasant and gentle and you shall be rewarded But to shew you still further how much you have entertained me I command that henceforth your tale shall be called Le JALOUX CHATIE"  Our troubadour's tale is greatly enlivened by these accompaniments and by being thrown into the mouth of a minstrel  is represented walking in a delicious meadow Here he discovers a path which conducts him to a glorious image both whose hands are stretched out and pointing to two highways one of which is the path of CONTEMPLATION the other of ACTIVE LIFE leading to the Tower of Beauty He chuses the lastmentioned path yet is often tempted to turn aside into a variety of byepaths which seemed more pleasant but proceeding directly forward he sees afar off another image on whose breast is written  "This is the road to the Tower of DOCTRINE he that would arrive there must avoid sloth c"  The evening  being far advanced he sits down at the feet of the image and falls into a profound sleep when towards the morning he is suddenly awakened by the loud blast of a horn He looks forward through a valley and perceives a beautiful lady on a palfrey swift as the wind riding towards him encircled with tongues of fire  In Shakespeare RUMOUR is painted  full of tongues  This was from the PAGEANTS  Her name was FAME and with her ran two milkwhite greyhounds on whose golden collars were inscribed in diamond letters  Grace  and  Governaunce  See supr vol i p Greyhounds were antiently almost as great favourites as hawks Our forefathers reduced hunting to a science and have left large treatises on this species of diversion which was so connected with their state of life and manners The most curious one I know is or was lately among the manuscripts of Mr Farmor of Tusmore in Oxfordshire It is entitled  "LE ART DE VENERIE le quel maistre Guillame Twici venour le roy d'Angleterre sist  n son temps per aprandre autres"  This  master William Twici  was grand huntsman to Edward the second In the Cotton library this book occurs in English under the names of William Twety and John Giffard most probably a translation from the French copy with the title of  a book of Venerie dialogue wise  Princ  "TWETY now will we beginnen"  MSS Cotton VESPAS B xii The less antient tract on this subject called the  Maistre of the Game  written for the instruction of prince Henry a  terwards Henry the fi  th is much more common MSS Digb Bibl Bodl I believe the  maistre veneur  has been long abolished in England but the  oyal falcon  r  still remains The latter was an officer of high dignity in the Grecian court of Constantinople at an early period under the style of  Pachym lib i c x Codin cap ii Phrenzes says that the emperor Andronicus Palaeologus the younger kept more than one thousand and four hundred hawks with almost as many men to take care of them lib i c  About the year Winifrid or Boniface a native of England and archbishop of Mons acquaints Ethelbald a king of Kent that he has sent him one hawk two falcons and two shields And Hedilbert a king of the Mercians requests the same archbishop Winifrid to send him two falcons which have been trained to kill cranes See EPISTOL Winifrid Bonifac Mogunt And in Bibl Patr tom vi and tom xiii p  Falconry  or a right to sport with falcons is mentioned so early as the year Chart Ottonis iii Imperator ann apud Ughell de Episcop Januens A charter of Kenulf king of the Mercians granted to the abbey of Abingdon and dated prohibits all persons carrying hawks or falcons to trespass on the lands of the monks Dugd Monast i p Julius Firmicus who wrote about the year is the first Latin author who mentions hawking or has even used the word FALCO Math  s lib v c vii c Hawking is often mentioned in the capitularies of the eighth and ninth centuries The  grand fauconnier  of France was an officer of great eminence His salary was four thousand florins he was attended by a retinue of fifty gentlemen and fifty assistant falconers and allowed to keep three hundred hawks He licens  d every vender of falcons in France and received a tribute for every bird that was sold in that kingdom even within the verge of the court The king of France never rode out on any occasion without this officer See supr vol i p  An ingenious French writer insinuates that the passion for hunting which at this day subsists as a favourite and  ashionable species of diversion in the most civilised countries of Europe is a strong indication of our gothic origin and is one of the savage habits yet unreformed of our northern ancestors Perhaps there is too much refinement in this remark The pleasures of the chace seem to have been implanted by nature and under due regulation if pursued as a matter of mere relaxation and not of employment are by no means incompatible with the modes of polished life  Her palfrey is Pegasus and the burning tongues denote her office of consigning the names of  illustrious personages to posterity among which she mentions a lady of matchless accomplishments named LA BELL PUCELL who lives within a tower seated in a delightful island but which no person can enter without surmounting

this profusion of fabulous history which our author seems to think real the history of the Bible is introduced which he traces from the patriarchs down to the day of judgment At the close of the whole he gives us some more of his fashionable accomplishments and says that he is skilled in the plain chant in singing to the lute in making canzonetts pastorals amorous and pleasant poesies and in dancing that he is beloved by ecclesiastics knights ladies citizens minstrels squires c The author of this TREASURE or cyclopede of science mentioned above is Pierre de Corbian who lived about the

thunder and breathing flame which my author strongly paints  The fyre was greet it made the ylande lyght  PERSEVERANCE tells our hero that this monster was framed by the two witches STRANGENESS and DISDAINE to punish La Bell Pucell for having banished them from her presence His body was composed of the seven metals and within it a demon was inclosed They now enter a neighbouring temple of Pallas who shews Amoure in a trance the secret formation of this monster and gives him a box of wonderful ointment They walk on the seashore and espy two ladies rowing towards them who land and having told Amoure that they are sent by PATIENCE to enquire his  name receive him and his company into the ship PERFECTNESS They arrive in the island and Amoure discovers the monster near a rock whom he now examines more distinctly The face of the monster resembled a virgin's and was of gold his neck of silver his breast of steel his forelegs armed with strong talons of laten his back of copper his tail of lead c Amoure in imitation of Jason anoints his sword and armour with the unguent of Pallas which at the first onset preserves him from the voluminous torrent of fire and smoke issuing from the monster's mouth At length he is killed and from his body flew out a  foule ethiope  or black spirit accompanied with such a smoke that all the island was darkened and loud thunderclaps ensued When this spirit was entirely vanished the air grew serene and our hero now plainly beheld the magnificent castle of La Pucell walled with silver and  many a story upon the wall enameled royally  See supr

printed copy of this favourite volume must have been known to our poet Hawes which appeared in fol By the way in panegyrising Chaucer Hawes mentions it as a circumstance of distinction that his works were printed ch xiiii  Whose name  In PRINTED bokès doth remayne in fame  This was natural at the beginning of the typographic art Many of Chaucer's poems were now recently printed by Caxton  With regard to Millorie's book much if not most of it I believe is taken from the great French romance of LANCELOT translated from Latin into French at the command of one of our Henrys a metrical English version of which is now in Benet library at Cambridge See a specimen in Mr Naasmith's curious catalogue p I have left it doubtful whether it was the third Henry who ordered this romance to be translated into Latin vol i p But beside the proofs there suggested in favour of that hypothesis it appears that Henry the third paid great attention to these compositions from the following curious anecdote just published which throws new light on that monarch's character  Arnaud Daniel a troubadour highly celebrated by Dante and Petrarch about the year made a voyage into England where in the court of king Henry the third he met a minst  who challenged him at  difficult rhymes  The challenge was accep  ed a considerable wager was laid and the rival bards were shut up in separate chambers of the palace The king who appears to have much interested himself in the dispute allowed them ten days for  composing  and five more for  learning to sing  their respective pieces after which each was to exhibit his performance in the presence of his majesty The third day the English minstrel announced that he was ready The troubadour declared he had not wrote a line but that he had tried and could not as yet put two words together The following evening he overheard the minstrel practising his  chanson  to himself The next day he had the good fortune to hear the same again and learned the air and words At the day appointed they both appeared before the king Arnaud desired to sing first The minstrel in a fit of the greatest surprise and astonishment suddenly cried out  C'est ma chanson This is  MY SONG The king said it was impossible The minstrel still insisted upon it and Arnaud being closely pressed ingenuously told the whole affair The king was much entertained with this adventure and ordering the wager to be withdrawn loaded them with rich presents But he afterwards obliged Arnaud to give a  chanson  of his own composition Millot ut supr tom ii p  In the mean time I would not be understood to deny that Henry the second encouraged these pieces for it partly appears that Gualter Mapes archdeacon of Oxford translated from Latin into French the popular romance of

crowned with a triple diadem of gold enter the temple and pronounce an exhortation Last follows an epilogue in which the poet apologises for his hardiness in attempting to  feign  and  devise  this fable  The reader readily perceives that this poetical apologue is intended to shadow the education of a complete gentleman or rather to point out those accomplishments which constitute the character of true gallantry and most justly deserve the reward of beauty It is not pretended that the personifications display that force of colouring and distinctness of delineation which animate the ideal portraits of John of Meun But we must acknowledge that Hawes has shewn no inconsiderable share of imagination if not in inventing romantic action at least in applying and enriching the general incidents of the Gothic fable In the creation of allegoric imagery he has exceeded Lydgate That he is greatly superior to many of his immediate predecessors and cotemporaries in harmonious versification and clear expression will appear from the following stanza  Besydes this gyaunt upon every tree  I did see hanging many a goodly shielde  Of noble knygtes that were of hie degree  Whiche

entirely lost and neglected He allows that some of Lydgate's successors had been skilful versifiers in the  balade royall  or octave stanza which Lydgate carried to such perfection but adds this

 The dedication is dated See Hendreich PANDECT p  The design was to ridicule the reigning vices and follies of every rank and profession under the allegory of a Ship freighted with Fools of all kinds but without any variety of incident or artificiality of fable yet although the poem is destitute of plot and the voyage of adventures a composition of such a nature became extremely popular It was translated into French  By Joce Bade Paris  and in the year into tolerable Latin verse by James Locher a German and a scholar of the inventour Brandt  See THE PROLOGUE  From the original and the two

denied that his language is more cultivated than that of many of his cotemporaries and that he contributed his share to the improvement of the English phraseology His author Sebastian Brandt appears to have been a man of universal erudition and his work for the most part is a tissue of citations from the ancient poets and historians  Barklay's other pieces are the MIRROUR OF GOOD MANNERS and five

by shepherds he seems to describe some large and splendid picture of the Nativity painted on the walls of Ely cathedral  I sawe them myselfe well paynted on the wall  Late gasing upon our churche

the shepherds into these pastorals exhibits no very masterly strokes of a sublime and inventive fancy It has much of the trite imagery usually applied in the fabrication of these ideal edifices It however shews our author in a new walk of poetry This magnificent tower or castle is built on inaccessible cliffs of flint the walls are of gold bright as the sun and decorated with  olde historyes and pictures manyfolde  the turrets are beautifully shaped Among its heroic inhabitants are king Henry the eighth Howard duke of Norfolk and the earl of Shrewsbury LABOUR is the porter at the gate and VIRTUE governs the house LABOUR is thus pictured with some degree of spirit  Fearfull is LABOUR without favour at all  Dreadfull of visage a monster intractable  Like Cerberus lying at gates infernall  To some men his looke is halfe intollerable  His shoulders large for burden strong and able  His bodie bristled his necke mightie and stiffe  By sturdie sinewes his joynts strong and stable  Like marble stones his handès be as stiffe  Here must man vanquish the dragon of Cadmus  Gainst the Chimere here stoutly must he fight  Here must he vanquish the fearfull Pegasus  For the golden flece here must he shewe his might  If LABOUR gainsay he can nothing be right  This monster LABOUR oft changeth his figure  Sometime an oxe a bore or lion wight  Playnely he seemeth thus changeth his nature  Like as Protheus ofte changeth his stature  * * * * * * * * *  Under his browes he dreadfully doth lowre  With glistering eyes and sidedependant beard  For thirst and hunger alway his chere is soure  His horned forehead doth make faynt hearts afeard  Alway he drinketh and yet alway is drye  The sweat distilling with droppes abundant c  e  EGL iv  The poet adds that when the noble Howard had long boldly contended with this hideous monster had broken the bars and doors of the castle had bound the porter and was now preparing to ascend the tower of Virtue and Honour FORTUNE and DEATH appeared

model appeared about the year and were followed by many others Their number multiplied so soon that a collection of thirtyeight modern bucolic poets in Latin was printed at Basil in the year  Viz xxxviii AUTHOR  BUCOLICI Basil vo  These writers judged this indirect and disguised mode of dialogue consisting of simple characters which spoke freely and plainly the most safe and convenient vehicle for abusing  the corruptions of the church Mantuan became so popular as to acquire the estimation of a classic and to be taught in schools Nothing better proves the reputation in which this writer was held than a speech of Shakespeare's pedant the pedagogue Holofernes  "  Fauste precor gelida quando pecus omne sub ulmo  One of Mantuan's lines Farnaby in his Preface to Martial says that  Fauste precor gelida  was too often preferred to  Arma virumque cano  I think there is an old black letter translation of Mantuan into English Another translation appeared by one Thomas Harvey  Mantuan was

they were reprinted by the same and  might partly suggest the new idea of this kind of poetry  With what avidity the Italian and French poets in their respective languages entered into this species of composition when the rage of Latin versification had subsided and for the purposes abovementioned is an inquiry reserved for a future period I shall only add here that before the close of the fifteenth century Virgil's bucolics were translated into Italian  Viz LA BUCOLICA DI VIRGILIO per Fratrem Evangelistam FOSSA de Cremona ord servorum In Venezia to But thirteen years earlier we find

l'Elegie In Fiorenza  by Bernardo Pulci Fossa de Cremona Benivieni and Fiorini Buoninsegni  SECT VIII  IT is not the plan of this work to comprehend the Scotch poetry But when I consider the close and national connection between England and Scotland in the progress of manners and literature I am sensible I should be guilty of a partial and defective representation of the poetry of the former was I to omit in my series a few Scotch writers who have adorned the present period with a degree of sentiment and spirit a command of phraseology and a fertility of imagination not to be found in any English poet since Chaucer and Lydgate more especially as they have left striking specimens of allegorical invention a species of composition which appears to have been for some time almost totally extinguished in England  The first I shall mention is William Dunbar a native of Salton in East Lothian about the year His most celebrated poems are The THISTLE AND THE ROSE and THE GOLDEN TERGE  The THISTLE AND THE ROSE was occasioned by the marriage of James the fourth king of Scotland with Margaret Tudor eldest daughter of Henry the seventh king of England an event in which the whole future political state of both nations was vitally interested and which ultimately produced the union of the two crowns and kingdoms It was finished on the ninth day of May in the year nearly three months before the arrival of the queen in Scotland whose progress from Richmond to Edinburgh was attended with a greater magnificence of parade processions and spectacles than I ever remember to have seen on any similar occasion  See a memoir cited above in Leland's COLL tom iii APPEND edit p It is worthy of particular notice that during this expedition there was in the magnificent suite of the princess a company of players under the direction of one John Inglish who is sometimes called Johannes  "Amonge the saide lordes and the qweene was in order Johannes and his companye the menstrells of musicke c"  p See also p In the midst of a most splendid procession the princess rode on horseback behind the king into the city of Edinburgh p Afterwards the ceremonies of this stately marriage are described which yet is not equal in magnificence and expence to that of Richard the second with Isabell of France at Calais in the year This lastmentioned marriage is recorded with the most minute circumstances the dresses of the king and the new queen the names of the French and English nobility who attended the presents one of which is a golden cup studded with jewels and worth three thousand pounds given

supposed to be derived from  Arrow  being held a remedy for healing wounds inflicted by that weapon The poet to apologise for his boldness in personifying a plant has added  "full craftely conjurit

She next crowns the eagle king of fowls and sharpening his talons like darts of steel orders him to govern great and small the wren or the peacock with an uniform and equal impartiality I need not point out to my reader the political lessons couched under these commands NATURE now calls the flowers and observing the thistle to be surrounded  with a bush of spears and therefore qualified for war gives him a crown of rubies and says  "In field go forth and fend the laif  Defend the rest    The poet continues elegantly to picture other parts of the royal arms in ordering th  thistle who is now king of vegetables to prefer all herbs or flowers of rare virtue and rich odour nor ever to permit the nettle to associate with the flour de lys nor any ignoble weed to be ranked in competition with the lily In the next stanza where NATURE directs the thistle to honour the rose above all other flowers exclusive of the heraldic meaning our author with much address insinuates to king James the fourth an exhortation to conjugal fidelity drawn from the high birth beauty and amiable accomplishments of the royal bride the princess Margaret  Among the pageants exhibited at Edinburgh in honour of the nuptials she was complimented with the following curious mixture of classical and scriptural history  "Ny to that cross was a scarfawst scaffold made where was represented Paris and the three Deesses with Mercure that gaff hym the apyll of gold for to gyffe to the most fayre of the Thre which he gave to Venus In the scarfawst was also represented the Salutacion of Gabriell to the Virgyne

addresses the rose whom she calls  "O lusty daughter most benyng"  and whose lineage she exalts above that of the lily This was a preference of Tudor to Valois  She crowns the rose with  clarefied  gems the lustre of which illumines all the land The rose is hailed queen by the flowers Last her praises are sung by the universal chorus of birds the sound of which awakens the poet from his delightful dream The fairy scene is vanished and he calls to the muse to perpetuate in verse the wonders of the splendid vision  Although much fine invention and sublime fabling are displayed in the allegorical visions of our old poets yet this mode of composition by dealing only in imaginary personages and by excluding real characters and human actions necessarily fails in that chief source of entertainment which we seek in antient poetry the representation of antient manners  Another general observation immediately resulting from the subject of this poem may be here added which illustrates the present and future state of the Scotch poetry The marriage of a princess of England with a king of Scotland from the new communication and intercourse opened between the two courts and kingdoms by such a connection must have greatly contributed to polish the rude manners and to improve the language literature and arts of Scotland  The design of Dunbar's GOLDEN TERGE is to shew the gradual and imperceptible influence of love when too far indulged over reason The discerning reader will observe that the cast of this poem is tinctured with the morality and imagery of the ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE and the FLOURE AND LEAFE of Chaucer  The poet walks forth at the dawn of a bright day The effects of the rising sun on a vernal landscape with its accompaniments are thus delineated in the manner of

Dunbar is not less suited to satirical than to sublime allegory and that he is the first poet who has appeared with any degree of spirit in this way of writing since Pierce Plowman His THISTLE AND ROSE and GOLDEN TERGE are generally and justly mentioned as his capital works but the natural complexion of his genius is of the moral and didactic cast The measure of this poem is partly that of Sir THOPAS in Chaucer and hence we may gather by the way that Sir THOPAS was antiently viewed in the light of a ludicrous composition It is certain that the pageants and interludes of Dunbar's age must have quickened his invention to form those grotesque groupes The exhibition of MORALITIES was now in high vogue among the Scotch A Morality was played at the marriage of James the fourth and the princess Margaret  MEMOIR ut supr p  Mummeries which they call GYSARTS composed of moral personifications are still known in Scotland and even till the beginning of this century especially among the

undoubted proof that it was finished at the university of Paris It is probable as he was intended for the sacred function that he was sent to Paris for the purpose of studying the canon law in

touches of fancy and rural imagery But the verses will have another merit with those critics who love to contemplate the progress of composition and to mark the original workings of genuine nature as they are the effusion of a mind not overlaid by the descriptions of other poets but operating by its own force and bias in the delineation of a vernal landscape on such objects as really occurred On this account they deserve to be better understood and I have therefore translated them into plain modern English prose In the mean time this experiment will serve to prove their native excellence Divested of poetic numbers and expression they still retain their poetry and to use the comparison of an elegant writer on a like occasion appear like Ulysses still a king and conqueror although disguised like a peasant and lodged in the cottage of the herdsman Eumaeus  "Fresh Aurora the wife of Tithonus issued from her saffron bed and ivory house She was cloathed in a robe of crimson and violetcolour the cape vermilion and the border purple she opened the windows of her ample hall overspread with roses and filled with balm or nard At the same time the crystal gates of heaven were thrown open to illumine the world The glittering streamers of the orient diffused purple streaks mingled with gold and azureThe steeds of the sun in red harness of rubies of colour brown as the berry lifted their heads above th  sea to glad our hemisphere the flames burst f  om their  nostrilsWhile shortly apparelled in his luminous array Phebus bearing the blazing torch of day issued from his royal palace with a golden crown glorious visage curled locks bright as the chrysolite or topaz and with a radiance intolerableThe fiery  parks bursting from his eyes purged the air and gilded the new verdureThe golden vanes of his throne covered the ocean with a glittering glance and the broad waters were all in a blaze at the first glimpse of his appearance It was glorious to see the winds appeased the sea becalmed the soft season the serene firmament the still air and the beauty of the watery scene The silverscaled fishes on the gravel gliding hastily as it were from the heat or sun through clear streams with fins shining brown as cinnabar and chisseltails darted here and there The new lustre enlightening all the land beamed on the small pebbles on the sides of rivers and on the strands which looked like beryl while the reflection of the rays played on the banks in variegated gleams and Flora threw forth her blooms und  r the feet of the sun's brilliant horses The bladed soil was embroidered with various hues Both wood and forest were darkened with boughs which reflected from the ground gave a shadowy lustre to the red rocks Towers turrets battlements and high pinnacles of churches castles and every fair city seemed to be painted and together with every bastion and story expressed their own shape on the plains The glebe fearless of the northern blasts spread her broad bosomThe corncrops and the newsprung barley recloathed the earth with a gladsome garmentThe variegated vesture of the valley covered the cloven furrow and the barleylands were diversified with flowery weeds The meadow was besprinkled with rivulets and the fresh moisture of the dewy night restored the herbage which the cattle had cropped in the day The blossoms in the blowing garden  trusted their heads to the protection of the young sun Rank ivyleaves overspread the wall of the rampart The blooming hawthorn cloathed all his thorns in flowers The budding clusters of the tender grapes hung endlong by their tendrils from the trellises The gems of the trees unlocking expanded themselves into the foliage of Nature's tapestry There was a soft verdure after balmy showers The flowers smiled in various colours on the bending stalks Some red c Others watchet like the blue and wavy sea speckled with red and white or bright as gold The daisy unbraided her little coronet The grass stood embattelled with banewort c The seeded down flew from the dandelion Young weeds appeared among the leaves of the strawberries Gay gilliflowers c The rose buds putting forth offered their  red vernal lips  to be kissed and diffused fragrance from the crisp scarlet that surrounded their golden seeds Lilies with white curling tops shewed their crests open The odorous vapour moistened the silver webs that hung from the leaves The plain was powdered with round dewy pearls From every bud scyon herb and flower bathed in liquid fragrance the bee sucked sweet honeyThe swans clamoured amid the rustling reeds and searched all the lakes and gray rivers where to build their nests The red bird of the sun lifted his coral crest crowing clear among the plants and  rutis gent  picking his food from every path and attended by his wives Toppa and Partlet The painted peacock with gaudy plumes unfolded his tail like a bright wheel inshrouded in his shining feathers resembling the marks of the hundred eyes of Argus Among the boughs of the twisted olive the small birds framed their artful nests or along the thick hedges or rejoiced with their merry mates on the tall oaks In the secret nook or in the clear windows of glass the spider full busily wove her sly net to ensnare  the little gnat or fly Under the boughs that screen the valley or within the paleinclosed park the nimble deer trooped in ranks the harts wandered through the thick woody shaws and the young fawns followed the dappled does Kids skipped through the briers after the roes and in the pastures and leas the lambs  full tight and trig  bleated to their dams Doris and Thetis walked on the salt ocean and Nymphs and Naiads wandering by springwells in the grassy groves plaited lusty chapl  ts for their hair of blooming branches or of flowers red and white They sung and danced cMeantime dame Nature's minstrels raise their amorous notes the ringdove coo  and pitches on the tall copse the starling whistles her varied descant the sparrow chirps in the clefted wall the goldfinch and linnet filled the skies the cuckow cried the quail twittered while rivers shaws and every dale resounded and the tender branches trembled on the trees at the song of the birds and the buzzing of the bees c"  This Landscape may be finely contrasted with a description of WINTER from the Prologue to the seventh book  P fol edit  a part of which I will give in literal prose  "The fern withered on the miry fallows the brown moors assumed a barren mossy hue banks sides of hills and bottoms grew white and bare the cattle looked hoary from the dank weather the wind made the red weed waver on the dike From crags and the foreheads of the yellow rocks hung great icicles in length like a spear  the soil was dusky and gray bereft of flowers herbs and grass in every holt and forest the woods were stripped of their array Boreas blew his bugle horn so loud that the solitary deer withdrew to the dales the small birds flocked to the thick briers shunning the tempestuous blast and changing their loud notes to chirping the cataracts  roared and every lindentree whistled and  brayed  to the sounding of the wind The poor labourers  went we  and weary draggled in the fen  The sheep and shepherds lurked under the hanging banks or wild broomWarm from the chimneyside and refreshed with generous cheer I stole to my bed and laid down to sleep when I saw the moon shed through the windows her twinkling glances and watery light I heard the horned bird the nightowl shrieking horribly with crook  d bill from her cavern I heard the wild  geese with screaming cries fly over the city through the silent night I was soon lulled asleep till the cock clapping his wings crowed thric  and the day peeped I waked and saw the moon disappear and heard the jackdaws cackle on the roof of the house The cranes prognosticating tempests in a firm phalanx pierced the air with voices sounding like a trumpet The kite perched on an old tree fast by my chamber cried lamentably a sign of the dawning day I rose and halfopening my window perceived the morning livid wan and hoary the air overwhelmed with vapour and cloud the ground stiff gray and rough the branches rattling the sides of the hills looking black and hard with the driving blasts the dewdrops congealed on the stubble and rind of trees the sharp hailstones deadlycold  hopping  on the thatch and the neighbouring causeway c"  Bale whose titles of English books are often obscured by being put into Latin recites among Gawin Douglass's poetical works his  Narration  s aureae  and  Comoediae aliquot sa  rae  xiv    Of his NARRATIONES AUREAE our author seems to speak in the EPILOGUE to VIRGIL addressed to his patron lord Sinclair  Ut supr p    I have also a strange command comment compyld  To expone strange hystoryes and termes wild  Perhaps these tales were the fictions of antient mythology Whether the COMOEDIAE were sacred interludes or MYSTERIES for the stage or only sacred narratives I cannot determine Another of his original poems is the PALICE OF HONOUR a moral vision written in the year planned on the design of the TABLET of Cebes and imitated in the elegant Latin dialogue  De Tranquillitate Animi  of his countryman Florence Wilson or Florentius Volusenus  Lugd apud Seb Gryph to  It was first printed at London in  In quarto Again  dinb to  "When pale Aurora with face lamentable"  Douglass also wrote a small Latin History  f Scotland See also a DIALOGUE concerning a theological subject to be debated between  duos famatos viros  G Douglas provost of saint Giles and master David Cranstoun bachelour of divinity pre  ixed to John Major's COMMENTARII  in  rim Sentent  Paris fol  The object of this allegory is to shew the instability and insufficiency of worldly pomp and to prove that a constant and undeviating habit of virtue is the only way to true Honour and Happiness who reside in a magnificent palace situated on the summit of a high and inaccessible mountain The allegory is illustrated by a variety of examples of illustrious personages not only of those who by a regular perseverance in honourable deeds gained admittance into this splendid habitation but of those who were excluded from it by debasing the dignity of their eminent stations with a vicious and unmanly behaviour It is addressed as an apologue for the conduct of a king to James the fourth is adorned with many pleasing incidents and adventures and abounds with genius and learning  SECT XIV  WITH Dunbar and Douglass I join Sir David Lyndesay although perhaps in strictness he should not be placed so early as the close of the fifteenth century He appears to have been employed in several offices about the person of James the fifth from the infancy of that monarch by whom be was much beloved and at length on account of his singular skill in heraldry a science then in high estimation and among the most polite accomplishments he was knighted and appointed Lion king of arms of the kingdom of Scotland Notwithstanding these situations he was an excellent scholar  See the WARKIS OF THE FAMOUS AND WORTHIE KNI  HT SCHIR DAVID LYNDESAY of the Mount c Newly

young I bare thee in myne arme  Full tenderlie till thow begouth to gang  Began to walk    And in thy bed oft lappit thee full warme  With lute in hand syne  Then  sweitlie to thee sang  He adds that

rhyme and consists of a variety of measures must have taken up four hours in the representation    In the PROLOGUE to the DREME our author discovers strong talents for high description and rich imagery In a  morning of the month of January the poet quits the copse and the bank now destitute of verdure and flowers and walks towards the seabeach The dawn of day is expressed by a beautiful and

antiquitie  He compares the fluctuation of the sea with the instability of human affairs and at length being comfortably shrouded from the falling sleet by the closeness of his cavern is lulled asleep by the whistling of the winds among the rocks and the beating of the tide He then has the following vision  He sees a lady of great beauty and benignity of aspect who says she comes to sooth his

borrowed from the first chapters of the Nuremburgh Chronicle a celebrated book when Lyndesay wrote printed in the year It is there said that of the water  above the firmament which were frozen like crystal God made the crystalline heaven c fol iv This idea is taken from GENESIS i See also saint Paul EPIST COR ii xii The same system is in Tasso where the archangel Michael descends from heaven GIER LIB C ix  t seq And in Milton PARAD L iii  They pass the planets seven and pass the fixed  And that crystallin sphere c  and are admitted to the  Empyreal  or heaven of heavens Here they view the throne of God surrounded by the nine orders of angels singing with ineffable harmony  Because the scriptures have mentioned several degrees of angels Dionysius the Areopagite and others have divided them into nine orders and those they have reduced into three hierarchies This was a tempting subject for the refining genius of the schooldivines and accordingly we find in Thomas Aquinas a disquisition  De ordinatione Angelorum secundum Hierarchias et Ordines  QUAEST cviii The system which perhaps makes a better figure in poetry than in philosophy has been adopted by many poets who did not outlive the influence of the old scholastic sophistry See Dante PARAD C xxviii Tasso mentions among  La grande o  e del ciel  TRE FOLTE SQUADRE et ogni squadra instrutta  In TRE ORDINI gira c

See also Jonson's ELEGIE ON MY MUSE in the UNDERWOOD p edit fol Lond  Next the throne is the Virgin Mary the queen of  queens  "well cumpanyit with ladyis of delyte"  An exterior circle is formed by

recently discovered would have been heresy in the science of cosmography as that quarter of the globe did not occur in Pliny and Ptolemy  For the benefit of those who are making researches in antient cosmography I observe that the map of England mentioned by Harrison and Hearne and belonging to Merton college library appears to have existed at least so early as the year For in that year it was lent to the dean of Wells William Cosyn with a caution of forty shillings Registr Vet Coll Mert fol b See its restitution ibid fol b  The most famous cities are here enumerated The poet next desires a view of Paradise that glorious  garth  or garden of every flower It is represented as elevated in the middle region of the air in a climate of perpetual serenity  "Paradisus tantae est altitudinis quod est inaccessibilis secundum Bedam et tam altus quod etheream regionem pertingat c"  CHRON NUR ut supr f viii b  From a  fair  fountain springing in the midst of this ambrosial garden descend four rivers which water all the east It is inclosed with walls of fire and guarded by an angel  The cuntre closit is about full richt  With wallis hie of hote and birnyng fyre  And straitly kepit by an angell bricht  SIGNAT E iii    From Paradise a very rapid transition is made to Scotland Here the poet takes occasion to lament that in a country so fertile and filled with inhabitants so ingenious and active universal poverty and every national disorder should abound It is very probable that the poem was written solely with a view of introducing this complaint After an enquiry into the causes of these infelicities which are referred to political mismanagement and the defective administration of justice the COMMONWEALTH OF SCOTLAND appears whose figure is thus delineated  We saw a busteous berne  Boisterous fellow  cum oer the bent  Coarse grass    But  Without  hors on fute als fast as he micht go  Quhose rayment was all raggit rewin  Riven  and rent  With visage leyne as he had fastit

me  JOHN for what reason I know not is a name of ridicule and contempt in most modern languages  Johne the Comoun weill  SI  NAT F i    The reply of SYR COMMONWEALTH to our poet's question is a long and general satire on the corrupt state of Scotland The spiritual plelates he says have sent away Devotion to the mendicant friars and are more fond of describing the dishes at a feast than of explaining the nature of their own establishment  Sensual Pleasure has banished Chastity  Liberality Loyalty and Knightly Valour are fled  And Cowardice with lords is laureate  From this sketch of Scotland here given by Lyndesay under the reign of James the fifth who acted as a viceroy to France a Scotch historian might collect many striking features of the state of his country during that interesting period drawn from the life  The poet then supposes that REMEMBRANCE conducts him back to the cave on the seashore in which he fell asleep He is awakened by a ship firing a broadside  They spared not the powder nor the  stones  A proof that stones were now used instead of leaden bullets At first they shot darts or  carrieaux i e  quarrels from great guns Afterwards stones which they called  gunstones  In the BRUT OF ENGLAND it is said that when Henry the fifth before Hareflete received a taunting message from the Dauphine of France and a ton of tennisballs by way of contempt  "he anoone lette make tenes balles for the  Dolfin  Henry's ship in all the haste that they myght and they were great  ONNESTONES for the  Dolfin  to playe with alle"  But this game at tennis was too rough for the besieged when Henry  "playede at the tenes with his harde  ONNESTONES c"  See Strutt's CUSTOMS AND MANNERS OF THE ENGLISH vol ii p Lond  He returns home and entering his oratory commits his vision to verse To this is added an exhortation of ten stanzas to king James the fifth in which he gives his majesty advice and censures his numerous instances of misconduct with incredible boldness and asperity Most of the addresses to James the fifth by the Scotch poets are satires instead of panegyrics  I have not at present either leisure or inclination to enter into a minute enquiry how far our author is indebted in his DREME to Tully's DREAM OF SCIPIO and the HELL PURGATORY and HEAVEN of Dante  In the Medicean library at Florence and the Ambrosian at Milan there is a long manuscript Italian poem in three books divided into one hundred chapters written by Matteo Palmeri a learned Flo  entine about the year It is in imitation of Dante in the  terza rima  and entitled CITTA DI V  TA or  The City of Life  The subject is the peregrination of the soul freed from the shackles of the body through various ideal places and situations till at length it arrives in the city of heaven This poem was publicly burnt at Cortona because the author adopted Origen's heresy concerning a third class of angels who for their sins wer  destined to animate human bodies See Trithem c Julius Niger SCRIPTO  FLORENT p    Lyndesay's poem called the MONARCHIE is an account of the most famous monarchies that have flourished in the world but like all the Gothic prosehistories or chronicles on the same favorite subject it begins with the creation of the world and ends with the day of judgment  In a manuscript at Lambeth this poem is said to have been begun Jun This is a great mistake It was printed Hafn to  There is much learning in this poem It is a dialogue between EXPERIENCE and a courtier This mode of conducting a narrative by means of an imaginary mystagogue is adopted from Boethius A descriptive prologue consisting of octave stanzas opens the poem in which the poet enters a delightful park  SIGNAT i B A park is a favorite scene of action in our old poets

his hands which were bloody See more of him in Chaucer's LAMENTAT MARY MAGD v In the Gothic pictures of the Crucifixion he is represented on horseback piercing our Saviour's side and in Xavier's Persic History of Christ he is called a horseman This notion arose from his using a spear or lance and that weapon  undoubtedly gave rise to his ideal name of Longias or Longinus He is afterwards

concerning the fall of man and the origin of human misery our author before he proceeds to his main subject thinks it necessary to deliver a formal apology for writing in the vulgar tongue He declares that his intention is to instruct and to be understood and that he writes to the people  Quharefore to colyearis carteris and to cuki  To  Jok  and Thome my ryme sall be derectit  SIGNAT C i  Moses he says did not give the Judaic law on mount Sinai in Greek or Latin Aristotle and Plato did not communicate their philosophy in Dutch or Italian Virgil and Cicero did not write in Chaldee or Hebrew Saint Jerom it is true translated the bible into Latin his own natural language but had saint Jerom been born in Argyleshire he would have translated it into Erse King David wrote the psalter in Hebrew because he was a Jew Hence he very sensibly takes occasion to recommend the propriety and necessity of publishing the scriptures and the missal and of composing all books intended for common use in the respective vernacular language of every country This objection being answered which shews the ideas of the times our author thus describes the creation of the world and of Adam  Quhen god

errors he attacks with much good sense solid argument and satirical humour and whose imperceptible increase from simple and humble beginnings to an enormity of spiritual tyranny he traces through a gradation of various corruptions and abuses with great penetration and knowledge of history  SIGNAT M iii    Among antient peculiar customs now lost he mentions a superstitious idol annually carried

spectacles instead  of saying plainly that the queen's death prevented the superb ceremonies which would have attended her coronation these stanzas have another merit that of transmitting the ideas of

clvii f b    Our author's COMPLAYNT contains a curious picture like that in his DREME of the miserable policy by which Scotland was governed under James the fifth But he diversifies and enlivens the

zealous and early friends to a reformation of religion than their neighbours in England The pomp and elegance of the catholic worship made no impression on a people whose devotion sought only for solid edification and who had no notion that the interposition of the senses could with any propriety be admitted to cooperate in an exercise of such a nature which appealed to reason alone and seemed to exclude all aids of the imagination It was natural that such a people in their system of spiritual refinement should warmly prefer the severe and rigid plan of Calvin and it is from this principle that we find most of their writers at the restoration of learning taking all occasions of censuring  the absurdities of popery with an unusual degree of abhorrence and asperity  In the course of the poem before us an allegory on the corruptions of the church is introduced not destitute of invention humour and elegance but founded on one of the weak theories of Wickliffe who not considering religion as reduced to a civil establishment and because Christ and his apostles were poor imagined that secular possessions were inconsistent with the simplicity of the gospel  In the primitive and pure ages of christianity the poet supposes that the Church married Poverty whose children were Chastity and Devotion The emperour Constantine soon afterwards divorced this sober and decent couple and without obtaining or asking a dispensation married the Church with great solemnity to Property Pope Silvester ratified the marriage and Devotion retired to a hermitage They had two daughters Riches and Sensuality who were very beautiful and soon attracted such great and universal regard that they acquired the chief ascendancy in all spiritual affairs Such was the influence of Sensuality in particular that Chastity the daughter of the Church by Poverty was exiled she tried but in vain to gain protection in Italy and France Her success was equally bad in England She strove to take refuge in the court of Scotland but they drove her from the court to the clergy The bishops were alarmed at her appearance and protested they would harbour no rebel to the See of Rome They sent her to the nuns who received her in form with processions and other honours But news being immediately dispatched to Sensuality and Riches of her friendly reception among the nuns she was again compelled to turn fugitive She next fled to the mendicant friers who declared they could not take charge of ladies At last she was found secreted in the nunnery of the Burrowmoor near Edinburgh where she had met her mother Poverty and her sister Devotion Sensuality attempts to besiege  this religious house but without effect The pious sisters were armed at all points and kept an irresistible piece of artillery

not whether this chaste sisterhood had the delicacy to observe strictly the injunctions prescribed to a society of nuns in England who to preserve a cool habit were ordered to be regularly blooded

church or to market with her face  mussaled  that is muzzled or covered Notwithstanding this seasonable interposition of the legislature the ladies of Scotland continued  muzzled  during three reigns  As appears from a passage in the poem before us  Bot in the kirk and market placis  I think thay suld nocht hide thair facis  He therefore advises the king to issue a proclamation  Both throw the land and Borrowstonis  To schaw thare face and cut thare gownis  He add  that this is quite contrary to the mode of the French ladies  Hails ane Frence lady quhen ye pleis  Scho wyll discover  mouth and neis  The enormous excrescence of female  tails was prohibited in the same statute  "That na woman wear tails unfit in length"  The legitimate length of these tails is not however determined in this statute a circumstance which we may collect from a mandate issued by a papal legate in Germany in the fourteenth century  "It is decreed that the apparel of women which ought to be consistent with modesty but now through their foolishness is degenerated into wantonness and extravagance more particularly the immoderate length of their petticoats with which they sweep the ground be restrained to a moderate fashion agreeably to the decency of the sex under pain of the sentence of excommunication  "Velamina etiam mulierum quae ad  v  recundiam designandam  eis sunt concessa sed nunc per insipientiam earum in lasciviam et luxuriam excreverunt et  immoderata lo  git  do superpelliceorum quibus pulverem trab  nt  ad moder  tum usum sicut  decet verecundiam sexus  per excommunicationis sententiam cohibeantur"  Ludewig RELIQ DIPLOM tom ii p  "  The orthodoxy of petticoats is not precisely ascertained in thi  salutary edict but as it excommunicates those female tails which in our author's phrase  keep the kirk and causey clean  and allows such a moderate standard to the petticoat as is compatible with female delicacy it may be concluded that the ladies who covered their feet were looked upon as very laudable conformists an inch or two less would have been avowed immodesty an inch or two more an affectation bordering upon heresy  See Notes to A  C SC POEMS ut supr p  What good effects followed from this ecclesiastical censure I do not find it is however evident  that the Scottish act of parliament against  long tails  was as little observed as that against  muzzling  Probably the force of the poet's satire effected a more speedy reformation of such abuses than the menaces of the church or the laws of the land But these capricious vanities were not confined to Scotland alone In England as we are informed by several antiquaries the women of quality first wore trains in the reign of Richard the second a novelty which induced a well  meaning divine of those times to write a tract  Contra caudas dominarum  against the Tails of the Ladies  See Collectanea Historica ex DIC  ION MS Thomae Gascoign Apud Hearne's W HEMINGFORD p  Whether or no this remonstrance operated so far as to occasion the contrary extreme and even to have been the distant cause of producing the short petticoats of the present age I cannot say As an apology however for the English ladies in adopting this fashion we should in justice remember as was the case of the Scotch that it was countenanced by Anne Richard's queen a lady not less enterprising than successful in her attacks on established forms and whose authority and example were so powerful as to abolish even in defiance of France the  afe commodious and natural mode of riding on horseback hitherto practiced by the women of England and to introduce sidesaddles  Chaucer represents his WI  OF BATH a  riding with a pair of spurs PROL v p Urr  And on her feete a paire of spurris sharpe    An anonymous Scotch poem

tempted to transcribe a few stanzas  For the use of this manuscript I am obliged to the ingenious Mr Pennant whose valuable publications are familiar to every reader of taste and science  It appears to have been written soon after the death of James the fifth  V  The poet mentions the death of James the fourth who was killed in the battle of Floddenfield fought in the year  V  It is entitled

Amergot Marcell who became at length so formidable and powerful as to claim a place in the history of France About the year he had occupied a strong castle for the space of ten years in the province of Auvergne in which he lived with the splendor and dominion of a petty sovereign  having amassed by pillaging the neighbouring country one hundred thousand francs His depredations brought in an annual revenue of twenty thousand floreins Afterwards he  is tempted imprudently to sell his castle to one of the generals of the king for a considerable sum Froissart introduces Marcell after having sold his fortress uttering the following lamentation which strongly paints his system of depredation the feudal anarchy and the trade and travelling of those days  "What a joy was it when we rode forthe at adventure and somtyme found by the way a ryche priour or marchaunt or a route of mulettes of Montpellyer of Narbone of Lymons of Fongans of Tholous or of Carcassone laden with clothe of

c f See also ib c  b Berners's Transl  "  But on the whole I am inclined to think that our testator Makgregor although a robber was a personage of high rank whose power and authority were such as to require this indirect and artificial mode of abuse For the same reason I believe the name to be fictitious  I take this opportunity of observing that the old Scotch poet Blind Harry belongs to this period and at the same time of correcting the mistake which in conformity to the common opinion and on the evidence of Dempster and Mackenzie I have committed in placing him towards the close of the fourteenth century  See supr vol i p Dempster says he lived in  John Major the Scotch historian who was born about the year remembered Blind Harry to have been living and to have published a poem on the achievements of Sir William Wallace when he was a boy He adds that he cannot vouch for the credibility of those tales which the bards were accustomed to sing for hire in the castles of the nobility  The poem as now extant has probably been reformed and modernised  I will give his own words  "Integrum librum Gulielmi Wallacei Henricus a nativitate luminibus captus meae infantiae tempore cudit et quae vulgo dicebantur carmine vulgari in quo peritus erat conscripsit Ego autem talibus scriptis solum in parte fidem impertior quippe qui HISTORIARUM RECITATIONE CORAM PRINCIPIBUS victum et

fable with true history will appear from some proofs collected by sir David Dalrymple in his judicious and accurate annals of Scotland lately published  See p edit to    I cannot return to the English poets without a hint that a wellexecuted history of the Scotch poetry from the thirteenth century would be a valuable accession to the general literary history of Britain The subject is pregnant with much curious and instructive information is highly deserving of a minute and regular research has never yet been uniformly examined in its full extent and the materials are both accessible and ample Even the bare lives of the vernacular poets of Scotland  have never yet been written with tolerable care and at present are only known from the meagre outlines of Dempster and Mackenzie The Scotch appear to have had an early propensity to theatrical representations and it is probable that in the prosecution of such a design among several other interesting and unexpected discoveries many anecdotes conducing to illustrate the rise and progress of our ancient drama might be drawn from obscurity  SECT XV  MOST of the poems of John Skelton were written in the reign of king Henry the

exercising the duties of the sacerdotal function Wood says he was also punished by the bishop for  "having been guilty  of certain crimes  AS MOST POETS are  AT  OXO  i  seq  "  But these persecutions only served to quicken his ludicrous disposition and to exasperate the acrimony of his satire As his sermons could be no longer a vehicle for his abuse he vented his ridicule in rhyming libels At length daring to attack the dignity of cardinal Wolsey he was closely pursued by the officers of that powerful minister and taking shelter in the sanctuary of Westminster abbey was kindly  entertained and protected by abbot Islip  His Latin epitaph or elegy on the Death of Henry the seventh is addressed to Islip A D p  to the day of his death He died and was buried in the neighbouring church of saint Margaret in the year  Skelton was patronised by Henry Algernoon Percy the fifth earl of Northumberland who deserves particular notice here as he loved literature at a time when many of the nobility of England could hardly read or write their names and was the general patron of such genius as his age produced He encouraged Skelton almost the only professed poet of the reign of Henry the seventh to write an elegy on the death of his father which is yet extant But still stronger proofs of his literary turn especially of his singular passion for poetry may be collected from a very splendid manuscript which formerly belonged to this very distinguished peer and is at present preserved in the British Museum  MSS Reg D  It contains a large collection of English poems elegantly engrossed on vellum and superbly illuminated which had been thus sumptuously transcribed for his use The pieces are chiefly those of Lydgate after which follow the aforesaid Elegy of Skelton and some smaller compositions Among the latter are a metrical history of the family of Percy presented to him by one of his own chaplains and a prolix series of poetical inscriptions which he caused to be written on the walls and ceilings of the principal apartments of his castles of Lekinfield and Wressil  See supr p And MSS C C C Cant Three of the apartments in Wressill Castle now destroyed were adorned with POETICAL INSCRIPTIONS These are called in the manuscript abovementioned  "PROVERBES in the LODGINGS in WRESSILL"  "The proverbes in the sydis of the innere chamber at Wressill"  This is a poem of twentyfour stanzas each containing seven lines  beginning thus  When it is tyme of coste and greate expens  Beware of waste and spende by measure  Who that outrageously makithe his dispens  Causy the his goodes not long to endure c  "The counsel  of Aristotill whiche he gayse to Alexander kynge of Massydony whiche are wrytyn in the syde of the Utter Chamber above the house in the Garden

th'Utter Chamber above of the hous in the gardying at Wresyll"  A poem of thirty stanzas chiefly of four lines viz  "Remorde thyne ey inwardly  "Fyx not thy mynde on Fortune that delythe dyversly c  The following apartments in Lekinfield had poetical inscriptions as mentioned in the said manuscript  "PROVERBS in the LODGINGS at LEKINGFIELD"  "The proverbis of the garett over the Bayne at Lekyngfelde"  This is a dialogue in stanzas of four lines between  "the Parte Sensatyve"  and  "the Part Intellectyve"  containing a poetical comparison between sensual and intellectual pleasures  "The proverbis in the garet at the new lodge in the parke of Lekingfelde"  This is a poem of stanzas of four lines being a discant on Harmony as also on the manner of Singing and playing on most of the instruments then used i e the Ha  ps Claricordes Lute Virgynall Clarisymballis Clarion Shawme Orgayne Recorder The following stanza relates to the SHAWME and shews it to have been u  ed for the

His  cultivation of the arts of external elegance appears from the s  ately sepulchral monuments which he erected in the minster or collegiate church of Beverly in Yorkshire to the memory of his father and mother which are executed in  the richest style of the florid Gothic architecture and remain to this day the conspicuous and striking evidences of his taste and magnificence In the year he founded an annual stipend of ten marcs for three years for a preceptor or professor to teach grammar and philosophy in the monastery of Alnewick contiguous to another of his magnificent castles  From

HOUSHOLD BOOK pag xxi seq  With so much boldness did this liberal nobleman abandon the example of his brother peers whose principal occupations were hawking and tilting and who despised learning as an ignoble and petty accomplishment fit only for the purposes of laborious and indigent ecclesiastics Nor was he totally given up to the pursuits of leisure and peace he was in the  year one of the leaders who commanded at the battle of Blackheath against lord Audley and his partisans and was often engaged from his early years in other public services of trust and honour But Skelton hardly deserved such a patronage  I am informed by a manuscript note in one of Mr Oldys's books that Skelton also wrote a poem called TITUS AND GESIPPUS This I believe to be a mistake for I suppose he attributes to Skelton William Walter's poem on this subject mentioned above p At the same time I take occasion to correct a mistake of my own concerning that piece which I have inadvertently called  "a translation from a Latin romance concerning the siege of Jerusalem"  ibid Titus and Gesippus were famous for their friendship and their history forms an interesting novel in Boccacio the substance of which is this Gesippus falling into poverty thought himself despised by Titus and thence growing weary of life gave out that he was guilty of a murther just committed But Titus knowing the true state of the case and desiring to save the life of his friend by losing his own charged himself with the murther at which the real murtherer who stood among the croud at the trial was so struck that he confessed the fact All three are saved and Titus to repair the broken fortunes of Gesippus gives him his sister in marriage with an ample dower Bocc DECAM Nov viii GIORN x This is a frequent

coarseness obscenity and scurrility of Skelton by saying that his poetry is tinctured with the manners of his age Skelton would have been a writer without decorum at any period The manners of Chaucer's age were undoubtedly more rough and unpolished than those of the reign of Henry the seventh Yet Chaucer a poet abounding in humour and often employed in describing the vices and follies of the world writes with a degree of delicacy when compared with Skelton That Skelton's manner is gross and illiberal was the opinion of his cotemporaries at least of those critics who lived but a few years afterwards and while his poems yet continued in vogue Puttenham the author of the ARTE OF ENGLISH POESIE published in the year speaking of the species of short metre used in the minstrelromances for the convenience of being sung to the harp at feasts and in CAROLS and ROUNDS  "and such other light or lascivious poems which are commonly more commodiously uttered by those buffoons or Vices in playes than by any other person"  and in which the sudden return of the rhyme fatigues the ear immediately subjoins  "Such were the rimes of Skelton being indeed but a rude rayling rimer and all his doings ridiculous he used both short distaunces and short measures pleasing only the popular care  Lib ii ch ix p  "  And Meres in his PALLADIS  TAMIA or WIT'S TREASURY published in  "Skelton applied his wit to skurilities and ridiculous matters such among the Greekes were called  pantomimi  with us buffoons  "Being the second part of WIT'  COMMONWELTH By Francis Meres maister of artes of both universities London printed by P Short c "  mo fol b The first part is  "POLITEUPHNIA Wit's Commonwealth for Nicholas Ling "  mo  "  kelton's characteristic vein of humour is capricious and grotesque If his whimsical extravagancies ever move our laughter at the same time they shock our sensibility His festive levities are not only vulgar and indelicate but frequently want truth and propriety His subjects are often as ridiculous as his metre but he sometimes debases his matter by his versification On the whole his genius seems better suited to low burlesque than to liberal and manly satire It is supposed by Caxton that he improved our language but he sometimes affects obscurity and sometimes adopts the most familiar phraseology of the common people  He thus describes in the BOKE OF COLIN CLOUTE the pompous houses of the clergy  Building royally  Their mancyons curiously  With turrettes and with toures  With halles and with boures  Streching to the starres  With glasse windowes and barres  Hangyng about the walles  Clothes of golde and palles  Arras of ryche arraye  Freshe as floures in Maye  With dame Dyana naked  Howe lystye Venus quaked  And howe Cupide shaked  His darte and

dozen    Their chambres wel be seene  With triumphes of Cesar c  Now  This is still a description of tapestry  all the world stares  How they ryde in goodly chares  Conveyed by olyphantes  With lauriat garlantes  And by unycornes  With their semely hornes  Upon these beastes riding  Naked boyes striding  With wanton wenches winkyng  For prelates of estate  Their courage to abate  From wordly wantonnes  Their chambers thus to dres  With such parfytness  And all such holynes  How beit they lett down fall  Their churches cathedrall  The Boke of Colin Cloute  p seq    These lines are in the best manner of his petty measure which is made still more disgusting by the repetition of the rhymes We should observe that the satire is here pointed at the subject of these tapestries The graver ecclesiastics who did not follow the levities of the world were contented with religious subjects or such as were merely historical Rosse of Warwick who wrote about the year relates that he saw in the abbat's hall at saint Alban's abbey a suite of arras containing a long train of incidents belonging to a most romantic and pathetic story in the life of the Saxon king Offa which that historian recites at large  J Ross WARWIC HIST REG ANGL edit Hearne p Hugh de Foliot a canon regular of Picardy so early as the year censures the magnificent houses of the bishops with the sumptuous paintings or tapestry of their chambers chiefly on the Trojan story  "Episcopi domos non impares ecclesiis magnitudine construunt Pictos del  ctantur habere thalamos vestiuntur ibi imagines pretiosis colorum

the Works of a cotemporary writer Hugo de SanctoVictore Among the manuscript EPISTLES of Gilbert de Stone a canon of Wells and who flourished about the year there is a curious passage concerning the spirit for foxhunting which antiently prevailed among our bishops Reginald Bryan bishop of Worcester in thus writes to the bishop of saint David's  "Reverende in Christo pater et domine premissa recommendatione d  bita tanto patri Illos optimos canes venaticos duodecim ad minus quibus  non vidimus meliores  quos nuper scitis vestra REVERENDA PATERNITAS repromisit quotidie expectamus  Languet namque cor nostrum  donec realiter ad manus n  stras ven  rit repromissum"  He then owns his  eagerness of expectation  on this occasion to be sinful but observes that it is the fatal consequence of that deplorable frailty which we all inherit from our mother Eve He adds that the foxes in his manor of Alnechurch and elsewhere had killed most of his rabbits many of his capons and had destroyed six of his swans in one night  "Veniant ergo PATER REVERENDE illae  sex Caniculorum copulae  et non tardent c"  He then describes the very exquisite pleasure he shall receive in hearing his woods echo

and their tabards to be studded with diamonds and rubies  P seq  That only these three English poets are here mentioned may be con  idered as a proof that only these three were yet thought to deserve the name  No writer is more unequal than Skelton In the midst of a page of the most wretched ribaldry we sometimes are surprized with three or four nervous and manly lines like these  Ryot and Revell

character exc  pt when he is indulging his native vein of satire and jocularity in the short minstrelmetre abovementioned which he mars by a multiplied repetition of rhymes arbitrary abbreviations of the verse cant expressions hard and sounding words newlycoined and patches of Latin and French This anomalous and motley mode of versification is I believe supposed to be peculiar to our author  Perhaps formed from Zanni or Giovanni a foolish character on the Italian stage See Riccoboni THEATR ITAL ch ii p seq  I am not however quite certain that it originated with Skelton  About the year Martin Coccaie of Mantua whose true name was Theophilo Folengio a Benedictine monk of Casino in Italy wrote a poem entitled PHANTASIAE MACARONICAE divided into twentyfive parts This is a burlesque Latin poem in heroic metre checquered with Italian and Tuscan words and those of the plebeian character yet not destitute of prosodical harmony It is totally satirical and has some degree of drollery but the ridicule is too frequently founded on obscene or vulgar ideas Prefixed is a similar burlesque poem called ZANITONELLA or the Amours of Tonellus and Zanina  I have given specimens But the following passage in the  Boke of C  lin Clout  affords  n apposite example at one view p  Of suche vagabundus  Speaketh  totus  undus  How some syng let abundus c  Cum ipsis et illis  Qui manent in

subjoined with the title of MOSCHEA or the War with the Flies and the Ants The author died in  See his Life Jac Phil Thomasin's Elog Patav to p  but these poems with  the addition of s  me epistles and epigrams in the same style did not I believe appear in print before the year  At Venice vo Again And vo  Coccaie is often cited by Rabelais a writer of a cogenial cast  See Liv iv c ii xi  The three last books containing a description of hell are a parody on part of Dante's INFERNO In the preface or APOLOGETICA our author gives an account of this new species of poetry since called the MACARONIC which I must give in his own words  "Ars ista poetica nuncupatur Ars MACARONICA a  Macaronibus  derivata qui  Macarones  sunt quoddam pulmentum farina caseo butyro compaginatum grossum rude

Vavassor observes that Coccaie in Italy and Antonius de Arena in France were the two first at least the chief authors of the semilatin burlesque poetry  DICT LUDR p  As to Antonius de Arena he was a civilian of Avignon and wrote in the year a Latin poem in elegiac verses ridiculously interlarded with French words and phrases It is addressed to his fellowstudents or in his own words  "Ad suos compagnones studiantes qui sunt de persona friantes bassas dansas in galanti stilo bisognatas cum guerra Romana totum ad longum sine require et cum guerra Neapolitana et cum revoluta Genuensi et guerra Avenionensi et epistola ad falotissimam garsam pro passando lo tempos  He wrote also DE BELLO MASSILIENS    "  I have gone out of my way to mention these two obscure writers  Erythra  us mentions Bernardinus Stephonius as writing in this way PINACOTH i p See also some poems in Baudius which have a mixture of the Gre  k and Latin la  guages and which others have imitated in German a  d Latin  with so much particularity in order to observe  that Skelton their cotemporary probably copied their manner at least to shew that this singular mode of versification was at this time fashionable not only in England but also in France and Italy Nor did it cease to be remembered in England and as a species of poetry thought to be founded by Skelton till even so late as the close of queen Elizabeth's reign As appears from the following poem on the SPANISH ARMADA which is filled with Latin words  A SKELTONICALL salutation  Or condigne gratulation  And just vexation  Of the Spanish

Fitzwater's daughter afterwards his fair maid Marian"  acted by lord Nottingham's players and printed in quarto at London in  is introduced by JOHN SKELTON  poet laureat to king Henry the eighth  The second part printed with the former is introduced by FRYAR TUCK with whom I am less acquainted    But I must not here forget that Dunbar a Scotch poet of Skelton's own age already mentioned wrote in this way His TESTAMENT OF MAISTER ANDRO KENNEDY which represents the character of an idle dissolute scholar and ridicules the funeral ceremonies of the Romish communion has  almost every alternate line composed of the formularies of a Latin Will and shreds of the breviary mixed with what the French call  Latin de cuisine  See ANT SCOTTISH POEMS Edinb p And the Notes of the learned and ingenious editor who says tha  Dunbar's DERGE is a most profane parody on the popish litanies p  There is some humour arising from these burlesque applications in the following stanzas  ST xiii xiv    In die

orator He is styled by Erasmus  "Britannicarum literarum decus et lumen  See Op p    His Latin elegiacs are pure and often unmixed with the monastic phraseology and they prove that if his natural propensity to the ridiculous had not more frequently seduced him to follow the whimsies of Walter Mapes and Golias  These two writers are ofte  confounded See the Second DISSERTATION James says that Golias was not a name adopted by Mapes but that there was a real writer of that name a collection of whose works he had seen See MSS Bibl Bodl JAMES i p Golias and Mapes appear to have been cotemporaries and of a similar genius The curious reader will find many extracts from their poetry which has very great merit in its way among James's manuscript collections The facility of these old Latin rhymers is amazing and they have a degree of humour and elegance far exceeding their age  than to copy the elegancies of Ovid he would have appeared among the first writers of Latin poetry in England at the general restoration of literature Skelton could not avoid acting as a buffoon in any language or any character  I cannot quit Skelton of whom I yet fear too much has been already said without restoring to the public notice a play or MORALITY written by him not recited in any catalogue of his works or annals of English typography and I believe at present totally unknown to the antiquarians in this sort of literature It is  The  NIGRAMANSIR a  morall  ENTERLUDE  and a pithie written by Maister  SKELTON  laureate and plaid before the king and other estatys at Woodstoke on Palme Sunday  It was printed by Wynkin de Worde in a thin quarto in the year  My lamented friend Mr William Collins whose ODES will be remembered while any taste for true poetry remains shewed me this piece at Chichester not many months before his death and he pointed it out as a very rare and valuable curiosity He intended to write the HISTORY OF THE RESTORATION OF LEARNING UNDER LEO THE TENTH and with a view to that design had collected many scarce books Some few of these fell into my hands at his death The rest among which I suppose was this INTERLUDE were dispersed  In the Mystery of MARIE

PHILARGYRIA  the great gigant of Great Britain what houses were builded and lands appointed for his provision  c"  to  or Avarice It is partly a satire on some abuses in the church yet not without a due regard to decency and an apparent respect for the dignity of the audience The story or plot is the tryal of SIMONY and AVARICE the devil is the judge and the notary public acts as an assessor or scribe The prisoners as we may suppose are found guilty and ordered into hell immediately There is no sort of propriety in calling this play the Necromancer  for the only business and use of this character is to open the subject in a long prologue to evoke the devil and summon the court The devil kicks the necromancer for waking him so soon in the morning a proof that this drama was performed in the morning perhaps in the chapel of the palace A variety of measures with shreds of Latin and French is used but the devil speaks in the octave stanza One of the stagedirections is  Enter Balsebub with a Berde  To make him both frightful and ridiculous the devil was most commonly introduced on the stage wearing a visard with an immense beard  Thus in Turpin's HISTORY OF CHARLEMAGNE the Saracens appear  "Habentes LARVAS BARBATAS cornutas DAEMONIBUS con  imi  es"  c xviii And in LEWIS THE EIGHTH an old French romance of Philip Mouskes  J ot apries lui une barboire  Com diable cornu et noire  There was a species of masquerad  celebrated by the ecclesiastics in France called the SHEW OF BEARDS entirely consisting of an exhibition of the most formidable beards Gregory of Tours says that the

repealed"  Dugd ibid p  Philargyria quotes Seneca and saint  Austin and Simony offers the devil a bribe The devil rejects her offer with much indignation and swears by the  foule Eumenides  and the hoary beard of Charon that she shall be well fried and roasted in the unfathomable sulphur of Cocytus together with Mahomet Pontius Pilate the traitor Judas and king Herod The last scene is closed with a view of hell and a dance between the devil and the necromancer The dance ended the devil trips up the necromancer's heels and disappears in fire and smoke  In the Mystery of MARY MAGDALENE just mentioned one of the stagedirections is  "Here enters the pryn  e of the devylls in a stage with hell onderneth the stage"  MSS DI  B  Great must have been the edification and entertainment which king

whether Rastall was not the printer only of these pieces If the printer only they might come from the festive genius of his brother sir Thomas More But Rastall appears to have been a scholar He was

died    I have before observed that the frequent and public exhibition of personifications in the PAGEAUNTS which antiently accompanied every high festivity greatly contributed to cherish the spirit of allegorical poetry and even to enrich the imagination of Spenser  And of Shakespeare There is a passage in ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA where the metaphor is exc  edingly beautiful but where the beauty both of the expression and the allusion is lost unless we recollect the frequency and the nature of these shews in S  akespeare's age ACT iv Sc xi I must cite the whole of the context for th  sake of

impersonated vices and virtues appeared must have concurred in producing this effect And hence at the same time we are led to account for the national relish for allegorical poetry which so long prevailed among our ancestors By means of these spectacles ideal beings became common and popular objects and emblematic imagery which at present is only contemplated by a few retired readers in the obsolete pages of our elder poets grew familiar to the general eye  SECT XVI  IN a work of this general and comprehensive nature in which the fluctuations of genius are surveyed and the dawnings or declensions of taste must alike be noticed it is impossible that every part of the subject can prove equally splendid and interesting We have I fear been toiling for some time through materials not perhaps of the most agreeable and edifying nature But as the mention of that very rude species of our drama called the MORALITY has incidentally diverted our attention to the early state of the English stage I cannot omit so fortunate and seasonable an opportunity of endeavouring to relieve the weariness of my reader by introducing an obvious digression on the probable causes of the rise of the MYSTERIES which as I have before remarked preceded and at length produced these allegorical fables In this respect I shall imitate those mapmakers mentioned by Swift who  O'er inhospitable downs  Place elephants for want of towns  Nor shall I perhaps fail of being pardoned by my reader if on the same principle I should attempt to throw new light on the history of our theatre by pursuing this enquiry through those deductions which it will naturally and more immediately suggest  Compar  vol i p    About the eighth century trade was principally carried on by means of fairs which lasted  everal days Charlemagne established many great marts of this sort in France as did William the conqueror and his Norman successors in  England  See supr vol i p  The merchants who frequented these fairs in numerous caravans or companies employed every art to draw the people together They were therefore accompanied by juglers minstrels and buffoons who were no less interested in giving their attendance and exerting all their skill on these occasions As now but few large towns existed no public spectacles or popular amusements were established and as the sedentary pleasures of domestic life and private society were yet unknown the fairtime was the season for diversion In proportion as these shews were attended and encouraged they began to be set off with new decorations and improvements and the arts of buffoonery being rendered still more attractive by extending their circle of exhibition acquired an importance in the eyes of the people By degrees the clergy observing that the entertainments of dancing music and mimicry exhibited at these protracted annual celebrities made the people less religious by promoting idleness and a love of festivity proscribed these sports and excommunicated the performers But finding that no regard was paid to their censures they changed their plan and determined to take these recreations into their own hands They turned actors and instead of pro  ane mummeries presented stories taken from legends or the bible This was the origin of sacred comedy The death of saint Catharine acted by the monks of saint Dennis rivalled the popularity of the professed players Music was admitted into the churches which served as theatres for the represention of holy farces The festivals among the French called LA FETE DE FOUX DE L'ANE

and quite new Religious plays he supposes came originally from Constantinople where the old Grecian stage continued to flourish in some degree and the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides were represented till the fourth century About that period Gregory Nazianzen an archbishop a poet and one of the fathers of the church banished pagan plays from the stage at Constantinople and introduced select stories from the old and new Testament As the antient Greek tragedy was a religious spectacle a transition was made on the same plan and the chorusses were turned into Christian hymns  See supr

the first time the Virgin Mary has been produced on the stage The fashion of acting  spiritual dramas in which at first a due degree of method and decorum was preserved was at length adopted from Constantinople by the Italians who framed in the depth of the dark ages on this foundation that barbarous species of theatrical representation called MYSTERIES or sacred comedies and which were soon afterwards received in France  Hist Gen Addit p    This opinion will acquire probability if we consider the early commercial intercouse between Italy and Constantinople and although the Italians at the time when they may be supposed to have imported plays of this nature did not understand the Greek language yet they could understand and consequently could imitate what they saw  In defence of Voltaire's hypothesis it may be further observed that the FEAST OF FOOLS and of the Ass with other religious farces of that sort so common in Europe originated at Constantinople They were instituted although perhaps under other names in the Greek church about the year by Theophylact patriarch of Constantinople probably with a better design than is imagined by the ecclesiastical annalists that of weaning the minds of the people from the pagan ceremonies particularly the Bacchanalian and calendary solemnities by the substitution of christian spectacles partaking of the same spirit of licentiousness The fact is however recorded by Cedrenus one of the Byzantine historians who flourished about the year in the following words  "  "  That is  "Theophylact introduced the practice which prevails even to this day of scandalising god and the memory of his saints on the most splendid and popular festivals by indecent and ridiculous songs and enormous shoutings even in the midst of those sacred hymns which we ought to offer to the divine grace with compunction of heart for the salvation of our souls But he having collected a company of base fellows and placing over them one Euthymius

Paris  p  t seq    I must however observe here what perhaps did not immediately occur to our lively philosopher on this occasion that in the fourth century it was customary to make christian parodies and imitations in Greek of the best Greek classics for the use of the christian schools This practice prevailed much under the emperor Julian who forbad the pagan poets orators and philosophers to be taught in the christian seminaries  Apollinaris bishop of Laodicea abovementioned wrote Greek tragedies adapted to the stage on most of the grand events recorded in the old Testament after the manner of Euripides On some of the familiar and domestic stories of scripture he composed comedies in imitation of Menander He wrote christian odes on the plan of Pindar In imitation of Homer he wrote an heroic poem on the history of the bible as far as the reign of Saul in twentyfour books  Sozomen ubi infra says that he compiled a system of grammar  on the christian model  Sozomen says that these compositions now lost rivalled their great originals in genius expression and conduct His son a bishop also of Laodicea reduced the four gospels and all the apostolical books into Greek dialogues resembling those of Plato  Socrates iii ii Sozomen v vi Niceph x    But I must not omit a much earlier and more singular specimen of a theatrical representation of sacred history than this mentioned

Moyne OBS ad VAR SACR tom i pag  Whether a theatre subsisted among the Jews who by their peculiar situation and circumstances were prevented from keeping pace with their neighbours in the culture of the social and elegant arts is a curious speculation It seems most probable on the whole that this drama was composed in imitation of the Grecian stage at the close of the second century after the Jews had been dispersed and intermixed with other nations  Boileau seems to think that the antient PILGRIMAGES introduced these sacred exhibitions into France  Chez nos devots ayeux le theátre abhorré

passages in the life of Christ descriptions of his crucifixion of the day of judgement of miracles and martyrdoms To these tales which were recommended by a pathetic chant and a variety of gesticulations the credulity of the multitude gave the name of Visions These pious itinerants travelled in companies and taking their stations in the most public streets and singing with their staves in their hands and their hats and mantles fantastically adorned with shells and emblems painted in various colours formed a sort of theatrical spectacle At length their performances excited the charity and compassion of some citizens of Paris who erected a theatre in which they might exhibit their religious stories in a more commodious and advantageous manner with the addition of scenery and other decorations At length professed practitioners in the histrionic art were hired to perform these solemn mockeries of religion which soon became the principal public amusement of a devout but undiscerning people  To those who are accustomed to contemplate the great picture of human follies which the unpolished ages of Europe hold up to our view it will not appear surprising that the people who were forbidden to read the events of the sacred history in the bible in which they were faithfully and beautifully related should at the same time be permitted to see them represented on the stage disgraced with the grossest improprieties corrupted with inventions and additions of  the most ridiculous kind sullied with impurities and expressed in the language and gesticulations of the lowest farce  On the whole the MYSTERIES appear to have originated among the ecclesiastics and were most probably first acted at least with any degree of form by the monks This was certainly the case in the English monasteries  In some regulations given by cardinal Wolsey to the monasteries of the canons regular of St Austin in the year the brothers are forbidden to be LUSORES  aut  MIMICI players or mimics Dugd Monast ii But the prohibition means that the monks should not go abroad to exercise these arts in a secular and mercenary capacity See ANNAL BURTONENSES p supra citat p By the way MIMICUS

Catharine performed at Dunstable abbey by the novices in the eleventh century under the superintendence of Geoffry a Parisian ecclesiastic and the exhibition of the PASSION by the mendicant friers of Coventry and other places Instances have been given of the like practice among the French  See supra vol i  The only persons who could read were in the religious societies and various other circumstances peculiarly arising from their situation profession and institution enabled the monks to be the sole performers of these representations  As learning encreased and was more widely disseminated from the monasteries by a natural and easy transition the practice migrated to schools and universities which were formed on the monastic plan and in many respects resembled the ecclesiastical bodies Hence a passage in Shakespeare's HAMLET is to be explained where Hamlet says to Polonius  "My lord you played once in the UNIVERSITY you say"  Polonius answers  "That I did my

mode of attack was seldom returned by the opposite party the catholic worship founded on sensible representations afforded a much better hold for ridicule than the religion of some of sects of the

and a more modern hand is  De Comediis ludisque in natali Christi exhibendis  With regard to the peculiar business and office of IMPERATOR it is ordered that one of the masters of arts shall be placed over the juniors every Christmas for the regulation of their games and diversions at that season of festivity At the same time he is to govern the whole society in the hall and chapel as a republic

performances and that he sate four hours every morning and afternoon with infinite satisfaction to hear syllogisms in jurisprudence and theology The first play during this solemnity was a pastoral comedy called ALBA in which five men almost naked appearing on the stage as part of the representation gave great offence to the queen and the maids of honour while the king whose delicacy was not easily shocked at other times concurred with the ladies and availing himself of this lucky circumstance peevishly expressed his wishes to depart before the piece was half finished  Ibid p  The second

Oration of the professor of Greek than the king  "The king heard him willingly and the Queen  much more  because she sayd she  never had h  ard Greek  "  Ibid  The third drama was the AJAX of Sophocles in Latin at which the stage was varied three times  Towards the end of the hall was a scene like a wall  "painted and adorned with stately pillars which pillars would turn about by reason

universities has never been considered as a circumstance instrumental to the growth and improvement of the drama While the people were amused with Skelton's TRIAL OF SIMONY Bale's GOD'S PROMISES and CHRIST'S DESCENT INTO HELL the scholars of the times were composing and acting plays on historical subjects and in imitation of Plautus and Terence Hence ideas of a legitimate fable must have been imperceptibly derived to the popular and vernacular drama And we may add while no settled or public theatres were known and plays were chiefly acted by itinerant minstrels in the halls of the nobility at Christmas these literary societies supported some idea of a  stage they afforded the best accommodations for theatrical exhibition and were almost the only certainly the most rational companies of players that existed  But I mean yet to trespass on my reader's patience by pursuing this inquiry still further which for the sake of comprehension and connection has already exceeded the limits of a digression  It is perhaps on this principle that we are to account for plays being acted by singingboys although they perhaps acquired a turn for theatrical representation and the spectacular arts from their annual exhibition of the ceremonies of the boybishop which seem to have been common in almost every religious community that was capable of supporting a choir  In a small college for only one provost five fellows and six choristers founded by archbishop Rotheram in in the obscure village of Rotheram in Yorkshire this piece of mummery was not omitted The founder leaves by will among

preserved in the university as a mockceremony on the night preceding the solemn Act of Magistration It is styled LUDUS a Play and I am of opinion that it is to be ranked among the other ecclesiastic mummeries of that age and that it has some connection with the exhibition mentioned above of shaving the Precentor in public  I have before given an instance of the singingboys of Hyde abbey and saint Swithin's priory at  Winchester performing a MORALITY before king Henry the seventh at Winchester castle on a Sunday in the year In the accompts of Maxtoke priory near Coventry in the year it appears that the eleemosinary boys or choristers of that monastery acted a play perhaps every year on the feast of the Purification in the hall of the neighbouring castle belonging to lord Clinton and it is specified that the cellarer took no money for their attendance because his lordship's minstrels had often assisted this year at several festivals in the refectory of the convent and in the hall of the prior without fee or gratuity I will give the article  which is very circumstantial at length  "Pro jentaculis puerorum eleemosynae exeuntium ad aulam in castro ut ibi  LUDUM  peragerent in die

many festivals both in the hall of the convent and in the prior's hall without reward So early as the year the scholars or choristers of saint Paul's cathedral in London presented a petition to king

retired to their hall where after dinner a  goodly play  was performed by the choristers of Westminster abbey with  waits and regals and singing  Strype's edit of Stowe's SURV LOND B v p  The children of the chapelroyal were also famous actors and were formed into a company of players by queen Elizabeth under the conduct of Richard Edwards a musician and a writer of Interludes already mentioned and of whom more will be said hereafter All Lilly's plays and many of Shakespeare's and Jonson's were originally performed by these boys  Six of Lilly's nine comedies are entitled COURTCOMEDIES which I believe were written professedly for this purpose These were reprinted together Lond mo His last play is dated  and it seems probable that the title given by Jonson to one of his comedies called CYNTHIA'S REVELS first acted in  "by the children of her majesties chapel with the allowance of the Master of the Revels"  was an allusion to this establishment of queen Elizabeth one of whose romantic names was CYNTHIA  They very frequently were joined by the choristers of saint Paul's It is a mistake that these were rival companies and that because Jonson's POETASTER was acted in the year by the boys of the chapel his antagonist Decker got his SATIROMASTIX an answer to Jonson's play to be performed out of opposition by those of saint Paul's Lilly's courtcomedies and many others were acted by the children of both choirs in conjunction It is certain that Docker sneers at Johnson's interest with the Master of the Revels in procuring his plays to be acted so often at court  "  Sir Vaughan  I have some cossengermans at court shall beget you the reversion of the master of the king's revels or else to be his lord of misrule nowe at Christmas"  SIGNAT G Dekker's SATIROMASTIX  or

general reputation which they gained and the particular encouragement and countenance which they received from the queen excited the jealousy of the grown actors at the theatres and Shakespeare in HAMLET endeavours to extenuate the applause which was idly indulged to their performance perhaps not always very just in the  following speeches of Rosencrantz and Hamlet  "There is an aiery of little

Some of these however were distinguished for their propriety of action and became admirable comedians at the theatre of Blackfriers  There is a passage in STRAFFORDE'S LETTERS which seems to shew that the dispositions and accommodations at the theatre of Blackfriars were much better than we now suppose  "A little pique happened betwixt the duke of Lenox and the lord chamberlain about a box at a new

thenc  took its name in the presence of most of the nobility and gentry of the kingdom in the years and In the ignorant ages the parishclerks of London might justly be considered as a literary society It was an essential part of their profession not only to sing but to read an accomplishment almost solely confined to the clergy and on the whole they seem to come under the character of a religious fraternity They were incorporated into a guild or fellowship by king Henry the third about the year under the patronage of saint Nicholas It was antiently customary for men and women of the first quality ecclesiastics and others who were lovers of churchmusic to be admitted into this corporation and they gave large gratuities for the support or education of many persons in the practice of that science Their public feasts which I have already mentioned were frequent and celebrated with singing and music most commonly at Guildhall chapel or college  Stowe's SURV LOND ut supr lib v p  Before the reformation this society was constantly hired to assist as a choir at the magnificent funerals of the nobility or other distinguished personages which were celebrated within the city of London or in its neighbourhood The splendid ceremonies of their anniversary procession and mass in the year are thus related by Strype from an old chronicle  "May the sixth was a goodly evensong at Guildhall college by the Masters of the CLARKS and their Fellowship with singing and playing and the morrow after was a great mass at the same place and by the same fraternity when every clark offered an halfpenny The mass was sung by diverse of the queen's Mary's chapel and children And after mass done every clark went their procession two and two together each having on a surplice and a rich cope and a garland And then fourscore  standards streamers and banners and each one that bare them had an albe or a surplice Then came in order the waits playing and then thirty clarkes singing FESTA DIES There were four of these choirs Then came a canopy borne over the Sacrament by four of the masters of the clarkes with staffe torches burning c  ECCLES MEM vol iii ch xiii p  "  Their profession employment and character naturally dictated to this spiritual brotherhood the representation of plays especially those of the scriptural kind and their constant practice in shews processions and vocal music easily accounts for their address in detaining the best company which England afforded in the fourteenth century at a religious farce for more than a week  Before I conclude this inquiry a great part of which has been taken up in endeavouring to shew the connection between places of education and the stage it ought to be remarked that the antient fashion of acting plays in the inns of court which may be ranked among seminaries of instruction although for a separate profession is deducible from this source The first representation of this sort which occurs on record and is mentioned with any particular circumstances was at Gray'sinn John Roos or Roo student at Gray'sinn and created a serjeant at law in the year wrote a comedy which was acted at Christmas in the hall of that society in

there is a DECLAMATION or rather Disputation w  th music concerning  Public E  tertainment by Moral R  pres  ntation  The disputants are Diogenes and Ari  ophanes I am informed that among the manuscript papers o  the late Mr Thomas Coxeter of Trini  y college in Oxford an ingenious and inqu  sitive gleaner of anecdotes for a biogra  hy of English poets there was a correspondence between sir Fulke Greville and Daniel the poet concerning improvements and reformations proposed to be made in these courtinterludes But this subject will be more fully examined and further pursued in its proper place  After the Restoration when the dignity of the old monarchical manners had suffered a long eclipse from a Calvinistic usurpation a feeble effort was made to revive these liberal and elegant amusements at Whitehall For about the year queen Catharine ordered Crowne to write a Pastoral called CALISTO which was acted at court by the ladies Mary and Anne daughters of the duke of York and the young nobility About the same time lady Anne afterwards queen plaid the part of Semandra in Lee's MITHRIDATES The young noblemen were instructed by Better  on and the princesses by his wife who perhaps conceived Shakespeare more fully than any female that ever appeared on the stage In remembrance of her theatrical instructions Anne when queen assigned Mrs Betterton an annual pension of one hundred pounds Langb DRAM P p edit Cibber's APOL p  This was an early practice in Franc  In Margaret de Valois queen of Navarre wrote Moralities which she called PASTORALS to be acted by the ladies of her court  "  But it was not only by the parade of processions  and the decorations of scenery that these spectacles were recommended Some of them in point of poetical composition were eminently beautiful and elegant Among these may be mentioned a masque on the story of Circe and Ulysses called the INNER TEMPLE MASQUE written by William  Brown a student of that society about the year  Printed from a manuscript in Emanuelcollege at Cambridge by Tho Davies WORKS of W Browne Lond vol iii p In the dedication to the Society the author says  "If it degenerate in kinde from those other the society hath produced blame yourselves for not keeping a happier muse"  Wood says that Browne  "retiring to the inner temple became famed there for his poetry"  ATH OXON i p  From this piece as a specimen of the templemasques in this view I make no apology for my anticipation in transcribing the following ode which Circe sings as a charm to drive away sleep from Ulysses who is discovered reposing under a large tree It is addressed to Sleep  THE CHARME  Sonne of Erebus and Nighte  Hye away and aime thy flighte  Where consorte none other fowle  Than the batte and sullen owle  Where upon the lymber gras  Poppy and mandragoras  With like simples not a fewe  Hange for ever droppes of dewe  Where flowes Lethe without coyle  Softly like a streame of oyle  Hye thee thither gentle Sleepe  With this Greeke no longer keepe  Thrice I charge thee by my wand  Thrice with moly from my hand  Doe I touch Ulysses' eyes  And with th' iaspis Then arise  Sagest Greeke  Pag    In praise of this song it will be sufficient to say that it reminds us of some favorite touches in Milton's COMUS to which it perhaps gave birth Indeed one cannot help observing here in general although the observation more properly belongs to another place that a masque thus recently exhibited on the story of Circe which there is reason to think had acquired some popularity suggested to Milton the hint of a masque on the story of Comus It would be superfluous to point out minutely the absolute similarity of the two characters they both deal in incantations conducted by the same mode of operation and producing effects exactly parallel  From this practice of performing interludes in the inns of court we may explain a passage in Shakespeare but the present establishment of the context embarrasses that explanation as it perplexes the sentence in other respects In the SECOND PART OF HENRY THE FOURTH Shallow is boasting to his cousin Silence of his heroic exploits when he studied the law at Clement'sinn  "I was once of Clement's inn where I think they will talk of mad Shallow yet  Sil  You were called  lusty Shallow  then cousin  Shal  I was called any thing and I would have done any thing indeed too and roundly too There was I and little John Doit of Staffordshire c You had not four such swingebucklers in the inns of court again We knew where all the Bona Roba's were cOh the mad days that I have spent  ACT iii SC iii  "  Falstaffe then enters and is recognised by Shallow as his brotherstudent at Clement'sinn  on which he takes occasion to resume the topic of his juvenile frolics exhibited in London fifty years ago  "She's old and had Robin Night work before I came to Clement's innHa cousin Silence that thou hadst That that this knight and I have seen Hah Sir John c"  Falstaffe's recruits are next brought forward to be inrolled One of them is ordered to handle his arms when Shallow says still dwelling on the old favorite theme of Clement'sinn  "He is not his craftmaster he doth not do it right I remember at MileEnd Green when I lay at Clement'sinn I was then Sir Dagonet in ARTHUR'S SHOW there was a little quiver fellow and he would manage you his piece thus c"  Does he mean that he acted sir Dagonet at Mileend Green or at Clement'sinn By the application of a parenthesis only the passage will be cleared from ambiguity and the sense I would assign will appear to be just  "I remember at Mileend Green when I lay at Clement'sinn I was then Sir Dagonet in ARTHUR'S SHOW there was a little quiver fellow c"  That is  "I remember when I was a very young man at Clement'sinn and not fit to act any higher part than Sir Dagonet in the interludes which we used to play in the society that among the soldiers who were exercised in Mileend Green there was one remarkable fellow c  In the text "When I  laid  at Clement's inn" i  lodged  or  lived  So Leland  "An old manor place where in tymes paste sum of the Moulbrays LAY for a starte"  That is LIVED  for a time  or  sometimes  ITIN vol i fol Again  "Maister Page hath translated the House and now much LYITH there"  Ibid fol And in many other places  "  The performance of this part of Sir Dagonet was another of Shallow's feats at Clement'sinn on which he delights to expatiate a circumstance in the mean time quite foreign to the purpose of what he is saying but introduced on that account to heighten the ridicule of his character Just as he had told Silence a little before that he saw Schoggan's head broke by  alstaffe at the courtgate  "and the  very same day  I did fight with one Sampson Stockfish a fruiterer behind Gray'sinn"  Not to mention the satire implied in making Shallow act Sir Dagonet who was King Arthur's Fool ARTHUR'S SHOW here supposed to have been presented at Clement'sinn was probably an interlude or masque which actually existed and was very popular in Shakespeare's age and seems to have been compiled from Mallory's MORTE ARTHUR or the history of king Arthur then recently published and the favorite and most fashionable romance  That Mileend green was the place for public sports and exercises we learn from Froissart In the affair of Tyler and Straw he says  "Then the kynge sende to them that they shulde all drawe to a fayre playne place called Myleend where the people of the cytie did sport themselve  in the somer season"  c Berner's TRANSL tom

gentlemen pensioners were borrowed of lord Salisbury Lord Holland his temporary Justice in Eyre supplied him with venison on demand and the lord mayor and sheriffs of London with wine On twelfthday at

feasted the king queen and princes at her house in Holborn The Wednesday before the PRINCE OF THE TEMPLE invited the prince Elector and his brother to a Masque at the Temple  This I think was

knighted him at Whitehall  Ibid p The writer adds  "Mrs Basset the great lacewoman of Cheapside went foremost and led the queen by the hand c"  See ibid p  "  But these spectacles and entertainments in our lawsocieties not so much because they were romantic and ridiculous in their mode of exhibition as that they were institutions celebrated for the purposes of merriment and festivity were suppressed or suspended under the false and illiberal ideas of reformation and religion which prevailed in the fanatical court of Cromwell The countenance afforded by a polite court to such entertainments became the leading topic of animadversion and abuse in the miserable declamations of the puritan theologists who attempted the business of national reformation without any knowledge of the nature of society and whose censures proceeded not so much from principles of a purer morality as from a narrowness of mind and from that ignorance of human affairs which necessarily accompanies the operations of enthusiasm  SECT XVII  WE are now arrived at the commencement of the sixteenth century But before I proceed to a formal and particular examination of the poetry of that century and of those that follow some preliminary considerations of a more general nature and which will have a reference to all the remaining part of our history for the purpose of preparing the reader and facilitating our future inquiries appear to be necessary  On a retrospect of the fifteenth century we find much poetry written during the latter part of that period It is certain that the recent introduction into England of the art of typography to which our countrymen afforded the most liberal encouragement and which for many years was almost solely confined to the impression of English books the fashion of translating the classics from French versions the growing improvements of the English language and the diffusion of learning among the laity greatly contributed to multiply English composition both in prose and verse These causes however were yet immature nor had they gathered a sufficient degree of power and stability to operate on our literature with any vigorous effects  But there is a circumstance which among some others already suggested impeded that progression in our poetry which might yet have been expected under all these advantages A revolution the most fortunate and important in most other respects and the most interesting that occur  in the history of the migration of letters now began to take place which by diverting the attention of ingenious men to new modes of thinking and the culture of new languages introduced a new course of study and gave a temporary  check to vernacular composition This was the revival of classical learning  In the course of these annals we must have frequently remarked from time to time striking symptoms of a restless disposition in the human mind to rouse from its lethargic state and to break the bonds of barbarism After many imperfect and interrupted efforts this mighty deliverance in which the mouldering Gothic fabrics of false religion and false philosophy fell together was not effectually completed till the close of the fifteenth century An event almost fortuitous and unexpected gave a direction to that spirit of curiosity and discovery which had not yet appeared in its full force and extent for want of an object About the year the dispersion of the Greeks after Constantinople had been occupied by the Turks became the means of gratifying that natural love of novelty which has so frequently led the way to the noblest improvements by the introduction of a new language and new books  and totally changed the state of letters in Europe  But it should be remembered that some learned Grecians foreseeing the persecutions impending over their country frequented Italy and taught their language there before the taking of Constantinople Some Gre  ks who attended the Florentine council and never returned for fear of the Turks founded the present royal library in the city of Turenne In the year the Greek emperor unable to resist the frequent insults of these barbarians came into England to seek redress or protection from Henry the fourth He landed at Dover attended by many learned Greeks and the next day was honourably received at Christchurch priory at Canterbury by the prior Thomas Chyllenden In a manuscript called SPECULUM PARVULORUM lib c MSS Bibl Lamb  th    This great change commenced in Italy a country from many circumstances above all others peculiarly qualified and prepared to adopt such a deviation Italy during the darkest periods of monastic ignorance had always maintained a greater degree of refinement and knowledge than any other European country In the thirteenth century when the manners of Europe appear to have been overwhelmed with every species of absurdity its luxuries were less savage and its public spectacles more rational than those of France  England and Germany Its inhabitants were not only enriched but enlightened by that flourishing state of commerce which its commodious situation aided by the combination of other concomitant advantages contributed to support Even from the time of the irruptions of the northern barbarians some glimmerings of the antient erudition still remained in this country and in the midst of superstition and false philosophy repeated efforts were made in Italy to restore the Roman classics To mention no other instances Alberti Mussato  He was honoured with the laurel and died  of Padua and a commander in the Paduan army against the Veronese wrote two Latin tragedies ECERRINIS  Printed at Venice fol with his EPISTOLAE ELEGI SOLILOQUIA ECLOGAE CENTO OVIDIANUS Latin History

FORTUNAE on Natural Causes and Fate And three books in heroic verse on the War against the Veronese abovementioned The name and writings of Mussato were hardly known till they were brought forward to the public notice in the ESSAY ON POPE which I shall not be accused of partiality as I only join the voice of the world in calling the most agreeable and judicious pi  ce of criticism produced by the present age  or the fate of the tyrant Ecerinus of Verona and ACHILLEIS on the plan of the Greek drama and in imitation of Seneca befor  the year The many monuments of legitimate sculpture and architecture preserved in Italy had there kept alive ideas of elegance and grace and the Italians from their familiarity with those precious remains of antiquity so early as the close of the fourteenth century had laid the rudiments of their perfection in the antient arts Another circumstance which had a considerable share in cl  aring the way for this change and which deserves particular attention was the innovation introduced into the Italian poetry by Petrarch who inspired with the most elegant of passions and cloathing his exalted feelings on that delicate subject in the most melodious and brilliant Italian versification had totally eclipsed the barbarous  beauties of the Provencial troubadours and by this new and powerful magic had in an eminent degree contributed to reclaim at least for a time the public taste from a love of Gothic manners and romantic imagery  In this country so happily calculated for their favourable reception the learned  ugitives of Greece when their empire was now destroyed found shelter and protection Hither they imported and here they interpreted their antient writers which had been preserved entire at Constantinople These being eagerly studied by the best Italian scholars communicated a taste for the graces of genuine poetry and eloquence and at the same time were instrumental in propagating a more just and general relish for the Roman poets orators and historians In the mean time a more elegant and sublime philosophy was adopted a philosophy more friendly to works of taste and imagination and more agreeable to the sort of reading which was now gaining ground The scholastic subtleties and the captious logic of Aristotle were abolished for the mild and divine wisdom of Plato  It was a circumstance which gave the greatest splendour and importance to this new mode of erudition that it was encouraged by the popes who considering the encouragement of literature as a new expedient to establish their authority over the minds of men and enjoying an opulent and peaceable dominion in the voluptuous region of Italy extended their patronage on this occasion with a liberality so generous and unreserved that the court of Rome on a sudden lost its austere character and became the seat of elegance and urbanity Nicholas the fifth about the year established public rewards at Rome for composition in the learned languages appointed p  ofessors in humanity and employed intelligent persons to traverse all parts of Europe in search of classic manuscripts buried in the monasteries  See  "Dominei Georgii DISSERTATIO de Nich quinti erga Li  et Literat Viros Patroc  nio"  Rom to Added to his LIFE    It was by means of the munificent support of pope Nicholas that Cyriac of Ancona who may be considered as

brother being made free of Rome P Jovius HIST lib xi ad calc And VIT LEON lib iii p Jovius says that the actors were  Roman  juventutis lepidissimi  And that several picces of poetry were recited at

Vatican and Leo was placed in a sort of throne Jov in VIT p  and Leo while he was pouring the thunder of his anathemas against the h  retical doctrines of Martin Luther published a bulle of excommunication against all those who should dare to censure the poems of Ariosto It was under the pontificate of Leo that a perpetual indulgence was granted for rebuilding the church of a monastery which possessed a manuscript of Tacitus  Paulus Jovius relates an anecdote of pope Leo the tenth which shews that some passages in the classics were studied at the court of Rome to very bad purposes I must give it in his own  ords  "Non caruit  tiam in  amia quod parum honeste nonnullos e cubiculariis suis erant enim  tota Italia nobilissimi adamare et cu  his tenerius atque libere jocari videretur"  In VITA LEONIS X p    It is obvious to observe how little conformable this just taste these elegant arts and these new amusements proved in their consequences to the spirit of the papal system and it is remarkable that the court of Rome whose sole design and interest it had been for so many centuries to enslave the minds of men should be the first to restore the religious and intellectual liberties of Europe The apostolical fathers aiming at a fatal and illtimed popularity did not reflect that they were shaking the throne which they thus adorned  Among those who distinguished themselves in the exercise of these studies the first and most numerous were the Italian ecclesiastics If not from principles of inclination and a natural impulse to follow the passion of the times it was at least their interest to concur in forwarding those improvements which were commended countenanced and authorised by their spiritual sovereign they abandoned the pedantries of a barbarous theology and cultivated the purest models of antiquity The cardinals and bishops of Italy composed Latin verses and with a success attained by none in more recent times in imitation of Lucretius Catullus and Virgil Nor would the encouragement of any other European potentate have availed so much in this great work of restoring literature as no other patronage could have operated with so powerful and immediate an influence on that order of men who from the nature of their education and profession must always be the principal instruments in supporting every species of liberal erudition  And here we cannot but observe the necessary connection between literary composition and the arts of design No sooner had Italy banished the Gothic style in eloquence and poetry than painting sculpture and architecture at the same time and in the same country arrived at maturity and appeared in all their original splendour The beautiful or sublime ideas which the Italian artists had conceived from the contemplation of antient statues and antient temples  were invigorated by the descriptions of Homer and Sophocles Petrarch was crowned in the capitol and Raphael was promoted to the dignity of a cardinal  These improvements were soon received in other countries Lascaris one of the most learned of the Constantinopolitan exiles was invited into France by Lewis the twelfth and Francis the first and it was under the latter of these monarch that he was employed to form a library at Fontainbleau and to introduce Greek professors into the university of Paris  Du Breul

parliament of Paris who like other public bodies eminent for their wisdom could proceed on no other foundation than that of ancient forms and customs and were alarmed at the appearance of an

suffer so great a dishonour to remain on the French nation and although he interposed his authority too late for a revocation of the decree he ordered the full price to be paid for the books This was the same parliament that opposed the reformation of the calendar and the admission of any other philosophy than that of Aristotle Such was Francis's sollicitude to encourage the graces of a classical style that he abolished the Latin tongue from all public acts of justice because the first president of the parliament of  Paris had used a barbarous term in pronouncing sentence  Matagonis de Matagonibus adversus Italogalliam Antonii Matharelli p  and because the Latin code and judicial processes hitherto adopted in France familiarised the people to a base Latinity At the same time he

studies much sooner than is commonly imagined So early as the year William Byngham rector of Saint John Zachary in London petitioned king Henry the sixth in favour of his grammar scholars for whom he had erected a commodious mansion at Cambridge called GOD'S HOUSE and which he had given to the college of Clarehall to the end that twentyfour youths under the direction and government of a learned

that these academical pupils in grammar with which the art of rhetoric was commonly  joined instead of studying the real models of style were chiefly trained in systematic manuals of these sciences filled with unprofitable definitions and unnecessary distinctions and that in learning the arts of elegance they acquired the barbarous improprieties of diction which those arts were intended to remove and reform That the foundations I have mentioned did not produce any lasting beneficial effects and that the technical phraseology of metaphysics and casuistry still continued to prevail at

the universities in which nothing was taught but words and syllables unprofitable subtleties elementary speculations and trifling distinctions  EPIST Petr Blesens vi fol a OPERA edit Paris fol  De

scholars of the twelfth century I remember to have seen a curious and striking anecdote which in a  short compass shews Becket's private ideas concerning the bigottries and superstitious absurdities of his religion The writer gives an account of a dinner in Becket's palace at which was present among many other prelates a Cistercian abbot This abbot engrossed almost the whole conversation in relating the miracles performed by Robert the founder of his order Becket heard him for some time with a patient contempt and at length could not help breaking out with no small degree of indignation  And these are your miracles  We must however view the liberal ideas of these enlightened dignitaries of the twelfth century under some restrictions It must be acknowledged that their literature was clogged with pedantry and depressed by the narrow notions of the times Their writings shew that they knew not how to imitate the beauties of the antient classics Exulting in an exclusive privilege the certainly did not see the solid and popular use of these studies at least they did not chuse or would not venture to communicate them to the people who on the other hand were not prepared to receive them Any attempts of that kind for want of assistances which did not then exist must have been premature and these lights were too feeble to dissipate the universal darkness The writers who first appeared after Rome was ravaged by the Goths such as Boethius Prudentius Orosius Fortunatius and Sedulius and who naturally from that circumstance and because they were Christians came into vogue at that period still continued in the hands of common readers and superseded the great originals In the early ages of Christianity a strange opinion prevailed in conformity to which Arnobius composed his celebrated book against the gentile superstitions that pagan authors were calculated to corrupt the pure theology of the gospel The prejudice however remained when even the suspicions of the danger were removed But I return to the progress of modern letters in the fifteenth century  SECT XVIII  SOON after the year Lillye the famous grammarian who had learned Greek at Rhodes and had afterwards acquired a polished Latinity at Rome under Johannes Sulpicius and Pomponius Sabinus became the first teacher of Greek at any public school in England This was at saint Paul's school in London then newly established by dean Colet and celebrated by Erasmus and of which Lillye as one of the most exact and accomplished scholars of his age was appointed the first master  Knight LIFE of Colet p Pace

three years more Latin than he could have acquired in any school in England  n  Liliana quidam  xcepta  not even Lillye's excepted EPISTOL p tom iii  And that antient prejudices were now gradually wearing off and a national taste for critical studies and the graces of composition began to be diffused appears from this circumstance alone that from the year one thousand five hundred and three to the reformation there were more grammar schools most of which at present are perhaps of little use and importance founded and endowed in England than had been for three hundred years before The practice of educating our youth in the monasteries growing into disuse near twenty new grammar schools were established within this period and among these Wolsey's school at Ipswich which soon fell a sacrifice to the resentment or the avari  e of Henry the eighth deserves particular notice as it rivalled those of Winchester and Eton To give splendor to the institution  beside the scholars it consisted of a dean twelve canons and a numerous choir  Tanner NOTIT MON p  So attached was Wolsey to the new modes of instruction that he did not think it inconsistent with his high office and rank to publish a general address to the schoolmasters of England in which he orders them to institute their youth in the most elegant literature  "Elegantissima literatura"  Fiddes's WOLSEY COLL p  It is to be wished that all his edicts had been employed to so liberal and useful a purpose There is an anecdote on record which strongly marks Wolsey's character in this point of view Notwithstanding his

his wisdom and gravity at a public assembly severely censured Colet the founder for suffering the Latin poets to be taught in the new structure which he ther  fore styled a house of pagan idolatry

previous foundations perhaps suspecting that such an endowment would not have coincided with his new course of erudition and would have only served to encourage that species of doctrine which had so long choaked the paths of science and obstructed the progress of useful knowledge  These happy beginnings in favour of new and a rational system of academical education were seconded by the auspicious munificence of cardinal Wolsey About the year he founded a public chair at Oxford for rhetoric and humanity and soon afterwards another for teaching the Greek language endowing both with ample

and educated at Louvain with the assistance of his scholar Thomas Parnell explained within the walls of his own monastery Plautus Terence and Cicero to those academics who saw the utility of philology and were desirous of deserting the Gothic philosophy It may seem at first surprising that Fox a weak and prejudiced writer should allow any merit to a catholic but Barnes afterwards appears to have been one of Fox's martyrs and was executed at the stake in Smithfield for a defence of Lutheranism  But these innovations in the system of study were greatly discouraged and opposed by the friends of the old scholastic circle of sciences and the bigotted partisans of the catholic communion who stigmatised the Greek language by the name of heresy Even bishop Fox when he founded the  Greek lecture abovementioned that he might not appear to countenance a dangerous novelty was obliged to cover his excellent institution under the venerable mantle of the authority of the church For as a seeming apology for what he had done he refers to a canonical decree of pope Clement the fifth promulged in the year at Vienne in Dauphine which enjoined that professors of Greek Hebrew and Arabic should be instituted in the universities of Oxford Paris Bononia Salamanca and in the cout of Rome  "Quem praeter  a in nostro Alveario collocavimus quod SACROSANCTI CANONES commodissime pro bonis literis et

statute which immediately follow deserve notice here and require explanation  "Nec tamen Eos hac ratione excusatos volumus qui Gra  cam lectionem in co SUIS IMPENSIS su  entare debent"  By Eos he means the bishops and abbots of England who are the persons particularly ordered in pope Clement  s injunction to sustain these lectures in the university of Oxford Bishop Fox therefore in founding a Greek lecture would be understood that he does not mean to absolve or excuse the other prelates of England from doing their proper duty in this nec  sary business At the same time a charg  on their negligence s  ms to be implied  It was under the force of this ecclesiastical constitution that Gregory Typhernas one of the learned Greek exiles had the address to claim a stipend for teaching Greek in the university of Paris  Naud i p This was in  We cannot but wonder at the strange disagreement in human affairs between cause and effect when we consider that this edict of pope Clement which originated from a superstitious reverence annexed to two of these languages because they composed part of the superscription on the cross of Christ should have so strongly counteracted its own principles and proved an instrument in the reformation of religion  The university of Oxford was rent into factions on account of these bold attempts and the advocates of the recent improvements when the gentler weapons of persuasion could not prevail often proceeded to blows with the rigid champions of the schools But the facetious disposition of  sir Thomas More had no small share in deciding this singular controversy which he treated with much ingenious ridicule  See among other proofs his E  ISTOLA  Scholasticis quibusdam Trojanos se appellantibus  published by Hearne vo  Erasmus about

banquets tournaments and masques exhibited at the same palace they were entertained with a Latin interlude or to use the words of a cotemporary writer with such an  "excellent Interlude made in Latin

of king Henry the eighth who notwithstanding he had attacked the opinions of Luther yet from his natural liveliness of temper and a love of novelty thought favourably of the new improvements of inconsiderable influence in supporting the restoration of the Greek language In a preacher at the public church of the university of Oxford harangued with much violence and in the true spirit of the antient orthodoxy against the doctrines inculcated by the new professors and his arguments were canvassed among the students with the greatest animosity But Henry being resident at the neighbouring royal manor of Woodstock and having received a just detail of the merits of this dispute from Pace and More interposed his uncontrovertible authority and transmitting a royal mandate to the university commanded that the study of the scriptures in their original languages should not only be permitted for the future but received as a branch of the academical institution  Erasm E  IST tom iii  Soon afterwards one of the king's  chaplains preaching at court took an opportunity to censure the genuine interpretations of the scriptures which the Grecian learning had introduced The king when the sermon was ended to which he had listened with a smile of contempt ordered a solemn disputation to be held in his own presence at which the unfortunate preacher opposed and sir Thomas More with his usual dexterity defended the utility and excellence of the Greek language The divine who at least was a good courtier instead of vindicating his opinion instantly fell on his knees and begged pardon for having given any offence in the pulpit before his majesty However after some slight altercation the preacher by way of making some sort of concession in form ingenuously declared that he was now better reconciled to the Greek tongue because it was derived from the Hebrew The king astonished at his ridiculous ignorance dismissed the chaplain with a charge that he should never again presume to

resided at the court of Rome in a high character At Oxford in particular these united endeavours for establishing a new course of liberal and manly science were finally consummated in the magnificent foundation of Wolsey's college to which all the accomplished scholars of every country in Europe were invited and for whose library transcripts of all the valuable manuscripts which now fill the Vatican were designed  Wood HIST UNIV OXON i    But the progress of these prosperous beginnings was soon obstructed The first obstacle I shall mention was indeed but of short duration It was however an unfavourable circumstance that in the midst of this career of science Henry who had ever been accustomed to gratify his passions at any rate sued for a divorce against his queen Catharine The legality of this violent measure being agitated with much deliberation and solemnity wholly engrossed the attention of many able philologists whose genius and acquisitions were destined to a much nobler employment and tended to revive for a time the frivolous subtleties of casuistry and theology  But another cause which suspended the progression of these letters of much more importance and extent ultimately most  happy in its consequences remains to be mentioned The enlarged conceptions acquired by the study of the Greek and Roman writers seem to have restored to the human mind a free exertion of its native operations and to have communicated a certain spirit of enterprise in examining every subject and at length to have released the intellectual capacity of mankind from that habitual subjection and that servility to system which had hitherto prevented it from advancing any new principle or adopting any new opinion Hence under the concurrent assistance of a preparation of circumstances all centering in the same period arose the reformation of religion But this defection from the catholic communion alienated the thoughts of the learned from those pursuits by which it was produced and diverted the studies of the most accomplished scholars to inquiries into the practices and maxims of the primitive ages the nature of civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction the authority of scripture and tradition of popes councils and schoolmen topics which men were not yet qualified to treat with any degree of penetration and on which the ideas of the times unenlightened by philosophy or warped by prejudice and passion were not calculated to throw just and rational illustrations When the bonds of spiritual unity were once broken this separation from an established faith ended in a variety of subordinate sects each of which called forth its respective champions into the field of religious contention The several princes of christendom were politically concerned in these disputes and the courts in which poets and orators had been recently caressed and rewarded were now filled with that most deplorable species of philosophers polemical metaphysicians The public entry of Luther into Worms when he had been summoned before the diet of that city was equally splendid with that of the emperor Charles the fifth  Luther Op ii  Rome in return  roused from her deep repose of ten centuries was compelled to vindicate her insulted doctrines with reasoning and argument The profound investigations of Aquinas once more triumphed over the graces of the Ciceronian urbanity and endless volumes were written on the expediency of auricular confession and the existence of purgatory Thus the cause of polite literature was for awhile abandoned while the noblest abilities of Europe were wasted in theological speculation and absorbed in the abyss of controversy Yet it must not be forgotten that wit and raillery drawn from the sources of elegant erudition were sometimes applied and with the greatest success in this important dispute The lively colloquies of Erasmus which exposed the superstitious practices of the papists with much humour and in pure Latinity made more protestants than the ten tomes of John Calvin A work of ridicule was now a new attempt and it should be here observed to the honour of Erasmus that he was the first of the literary reformers who tried that species of composition at least with any degree of popularity The polite scholars of Italy had no notion that the German theologists were capable of making their readers laugh they were now convinced of their mistake and soon found that the German pleasantry prepared the way for a revolution which proved of the most serious consequence to Italy  Another great temporary che  k given to the general state of letters in England at this period was the dissolution of the monasteries Many of the abuses in civil society are attended with some advantages In the beginnings of reformation the loss of these advantages is always felt very sensibly while the benefit arising from the change is the slow effect of time and not immediately perceived or enjoyed Scarce any institution can be imagined less favorable to the interests of mankind than the monastic Yet these seminaries although they were in a general view the nurseries  of illiterate indolence and undoubtedly deserved to be  uppressed under proper restrictions contained invitations and opportunities to studious leisure and literary pursuits On this event therefore a visible revolution and decline in the national state of learning succeeded Most of the youth of the kingdom betook themselves to mechanical or other illiberal employments the profession of letters being now supposed to be without support and reward By the abolition of the religious houses many towns and their adjacent villages were utterly deprived of their only means of instruction At the beginning of the reign of queen Elizabeth Williams speaker of the house of commons complained to her majestry that more than an hundred flourishing schools were destroyed in the demolition of the monasteries and that ignorance had prevailed ever since  Strype ANN REF p sub ann The greater abbies appear to have had the direction of other schools in their neighbourhood In an abbatial Register of Bury abbey there is this entry

consequence of this hasty measure of a rapacious and arbitrary prince What was taught in the monasteries was not always perhaps of the greatest importance but still it served to keep up a certain degree of necessary knowledge  I do not however lay great stress on the following passage which yet deserves attention in Rosse of Warwickshire who wrote about the year  "To this day in the cath  drals and some of the greater collegiate churches or monasteries quibusdam nobilibus collegiis and in the houses of the four mendicant orders useful lectures and disputations ar  kept up and such of

views By their connections with parliament and the frequent embassies to foreign courts in which they were employed they became acquainted with the world and the improvements of lif  and knowing where

governors of the most considerable convents especially those that were honoured with the mitre to receive into their own private lodgings the sons of the principal families of the neighbourhood for education About the year Thomas Bromele abbot of the mitred monastery of Hyde near Winchester entertained in his own abbatial house within that monastery eight young gentlemen or  gentiles pueri  who

other shining qualifications  Before we quit the reign of Henry the eighth in this review of the rise of modern letters let us turn our eyes once more on the universities which yet do not always give the tone to the learning of a nation  It ought not here to be unnoticed that the royal library of the kings of England originally subsisting in the old palace at Westminster and lately transferred to the British Museum received great improvements under the reign of Henry the eighth who constituted that elegant and judicious scholar John Leland his librarian about the year Tanner BIBL pag Leland at the dissolution of the monasteries removed to this royal repository a great number of valuable manuscripts particularly from saint Austin's abbey at Canterbu  y SCRIPT BRIT p One of these was a

have already mentioned the librarian of Henry the seventh Bartholomew Traheron a learned divine was appointed the keeper of this library by Edward the  ixth with a salary of twenty marcs in the year  See Rymer's FoeD xv p Under the reign of Eli  abeth Hentzner a German traveller who saw this library at Whitehall in says that it was well furnished with Greek Latin Italian and French books all bound in velvet of different colours yet chiefly red with clasps of gold and silver and that the covers of some were adorned with pearls and precious stones ITINERAR  Germaniae Angliae  c Noringb vo p It is

monarch This notion wa  first propagated by Smith in his life of Patrick Junius Vit QUORUND etc Lond to pp Great part of the royal library which indeed migrated to St James's under James the first was partly sold and dispersed at Cromwell's accession together with another inestimable part of its furniture medals rings and gems the entir  collection of Gorlaeus's DACTYLIOTHECA purchased by prince Henry and Charles the first It must be allowed that James the first greatly enriched this library with the books of lord Lumley and Casaubon and sir Thomas Roe's manuscripts brought from Constantinople Lord Lumley's chiefly consisted of lord Arundel's his father in law a great collector at the dissolution of monasteries James had previously granted a warrant to sir Thomas Bodley in to chuse any books from the royal library at Whitehall over the  Queen's Chamber  RELIQ BODL p Hearne p  In the year the learned Simon Grynaeus visited Oxford By the interest of Claymund  president of Corpus Christi college an admirable scholar a critical writer and the general friend and correspondent of the literary reformers he was admitted to all the libraries of the university which he says were about twenty in number and amply furnished with the books of antiquity Among these he found numerous manuscripts of Proclus on Plato many of which he was easily permitted to carry abroad by the governors of the colleges who did not know the value of these treasures  During his abode in England having largely experie  ced the boun  y and advice of sir Thomas  More he returned home fraught with materials which he had long sought in vain and published his PLATO  viz  "Platonis Opera cum commentarii  Procli in Timaeum et Politica Basil "  fol See the EPISTLE DEDICATORY to sir Thomas More He there mentions other pi  ces of Proclus which he saw at Oxford  In the year the king ordered lectures in humanity institutions which have their use for a time and while the novelty lasts to be founded in those colleges of the university where they were yet wanting and these injunctions were so warmly approved by the scholars in the largest societies that they seized on the venerable volumes of Duns Scotus and other irrefragable logicians in which they had so long toiled without the attainment of knowledge and tearing them in pieces dispersed them in great triumph about their quadrangles or gave them away as useless lumber  See Dr Layton's letter to Cromwell Strype's ECCL MEM i  The king himself also established some public lectures with large endowments  Wood HIST Univ Oxon i ii  Notwithstanding the number of students at Oxford daily decreased insomuch that in not because a general cultivation of the new species of literature was increased there were only ten inceptors in arts and three in theology and jurisprudence  Wood ibid sub anno    As all novelties are pursued to excess and the most beneficial improvements often introduce new inconveniencies so this universal attention to polite literature destroyed philosophy  The old philosophy was abolished but a new one was not adopted in its stead At Cambridge we now however find the antient scientific learning in some degree reformed by the admission of better systems  In the injunctions given by Henry to that university in the year for the reformation of study the dialectics of Rodolphus Agricola the great favorite of Erasmus and the genuine logic of Aristotle are prescribed to be taught instead of the barren problems of Scotus and Burlaeus  Collier ECCLES HIST vol ii p  By the same edict theology and causuistry were freed from many of their old incumbrances and perplexities degrees in the canon law were forbidden and heavy penalties were imposed on those academics who relinquished the sacred text to explain the tedious and unedifying commentaries on Peter Lombard's scholastic cyclopede of divinity called the SENTENCES which alone were sufficient to constitute a moderate library Classical lectures were also directed the study of words was enforced and the books of Melancthon and other solid and elegant writers of the reformed party recommended The politer studies soon afterwards seem to have risen into a flourishing state at Cambridge Bishop Latimer complains that there were now but few who studied divinity in that university  SERMONS c p Lond to Sermon before Edward the sixth in the year His words are  "It would pitty a man's heart to hear that I hear of the state of Cambridge what it is in Oxford I cannot tell There be few that study divinity but so many a  of necessitie must furnish the colledges"  But this is no proof of a decline of learning in that seminary Other pursuits were now gaining ground there and such as in fact were subservient to theological truth and to the propagation of the reformed religion Latimer himself whose discourses from the royal pulpit appear to be barbarous beyond their age in style manner and argument is an example of the necessity of the ornamental studies to a writer in divinity The  Greek language was now making considerable advances at Cambridge under the instruction of Cheke and Smith notwithstanding the interruptions and opposition of bishop Gardiner the chancellor of the university who loved learning but hated novelties about the proprieties of pronunciation But the controversy which was agitated on both sides with much erudition and produced letters between Cheke and Gardiner equal to large treatises had the good effect of more fully illustrating the point in debate and of drawing the general attention to the subject of the Greek literature  Ascham EPISTOL ut modo infr p a Ascham calls Gardiner  "omnibus literarum prudentiae consilii authoritatis praesidiis ornatissimus  absque ha  u  a re ess  t  literarum et academiae nostrae patronus amplis  imus"  But he says that Gardiner took this measure  "quorundam  invidoru  ho  inum  precibus victus"  ibid p b  Perhaps bishop Gardiner's intolerance in this respect was like his persecuting spirit in religion which only made more heretics Ascham observes with no small degree of triumph that instead of Plautus Cicero Terence and Livy almost the only classics hitherto known at Cambridge a more extensive field was opened and that Homer Sophocles Euripides Herodotus Thucydides Demosthenes Xenophon an Isocrates were universally and critically studied  Strype's CRANMER p Ascham EPISTOL L ii p b  But Cheke being soon called away to the court his auditors relapsed into dissertations on the doctrines of original sin and predestination and it was debated with great obstinacy and acrimony whether those topics had been most successfully handled by some modern German divines or saint Austin  Ascham E  IST lib ii  Ascham observes that at Oxford a decline of taste in both languages was indicated by a preference of Lucian Plutarch and Herodian in Greek and of Seneca Gellius and Apuleius in Latin to the more pure antient and original writers of Greece and Rome  EPISTOL lib i p b Dat edit  At length  both universities seem to have been reduced to the same deplorable condition of indigence and illiteracy  It is generally believed that the reformation of religion in England the most happy and important event of our annals was immediately succeeded by a flourishing state of letters But this was by no means the case For a long time afterwards an effect quite contrary was produced The reformation in England was completed under the reign of Edward the sixth The rapacious courtiers of this young prince were perpetually grasping at the rewards of literature which being discouraged or despised by the rich was neglected by those of moderate fortunes Avarice and zeal were at once gratified in robbing the clergy of their revenues and in reducing the church to its primitive apostolical state of purity and poverty  See Collier's ECCL H  ST Records lxvii p  The opulent see of Winchester was lowered to a bare title its amplest estates were portioned out to the laity and the bishop a creature of the protector Somerset was contented to receive an inconsiderable annual stipend from the exchequer The bishoprick of Durham almost equally rich was entirely dissolved A favorite nobleman of the court occupied the deanery and treasurership of a cathedral with some of its best canonries  B  rnet R  F P ii  The ministers of this abused monarch by these arbitrary dishonest and imprudent measures only provided instruments and furnished arguments for restoring in the succeeding reign that superstitious religion which they professed to destroy By thus impoverishing the ecclesiastical dignities they countenanced the clamours of the catholics who declared that the reformation was apparently founded on temporal views and that the protestants pretended to oppose the doctrines of the church solely with a view that they might share in the plunder of its revenues In every one of these sacrilegious robberies the interest of  learning also suffered Exhibitions and pensions were in the mean time substracted from the students in the universities  Wood s  b ann See also Strype's CRANMER Append N xciii p viz A Letter to

Reformation was soon turned into fanaticism Absurd refinements concerning the inutility of human learning were superadded to the just and rational purgation of christianity from the papal corruptions The spiritual reformers of these enlightened days at a visitation of the lastmentioned university proceeded so far in their ideas of a superior rectitude as totally to strip the public library established by that munificent patron Humphrey duke o  Gloucester of all its books and manuscripts  See supr p    I must not however forget as a remarkable symptom of an attempt now circulating to give a more general and unreserved diffusion of science that in this reign Thomas Wilson originally a fellow of King's college in Cambridge preceptor to Charles and Henry Brandon dukes of Suffolk dean of Durham and chief secretary to the king published a system a rhetoric and of logic in English  First printed in the reign of Edward the sixth See Preface to the second edition of the RHETORIC in He translated the three Olynthiacs and the four Philippic  of Demosthenes from the Greek into English Lond to  This display of the venerable mysteries of the latter of these arts in a vernacular language which had hitherto been confined within the sacred pale of the learned tongues was esteemed  an innovation almost equally daring with that of permitting the service of the church to be celebrated in English and accordingly the author soon afterwards happening to visit Rome was incarcerated by the inquisitors of the holy see as a presumptuous and dangerous heretic  It is with reluctance I enter on the bloody reign of the relentless and unamiable Mary whose many dreadful martyrdoms of men eminent for learning and piety shock our sensibility with a double degree of horrour in the present softened state of manners at a period of society when no po  entate would inflict executions of so severe a nature and when it would be difficult to find devotees hardy enough to die for difference of opinion We must however acknowledge that she enriched both universities with some considerable benefactions yet these donations seem to have been made not from any general or libe  al principle of advancing knowledge but to repair the breaches of reformation and to strengthen the return of superstition It is certain that her restoration of popery together with the monastic institution its proper appendage must have been highly pernicious to the growth of polite erudition Yet although the elegant studies were now beginning to suffer a new relapse in the midst of this reign under the discouragement of all these inauspicious and unfriendly circumstances a college was established at Oxford in the constitution of which the founder principally inculcates the use and necessity of classical literature and recommends it as the most important and leading object in that system of academical study which he prescribes to the youth of the new society  In the year  For beside a lecturer in philosophy appointed for the ordinary purpose of teaching the scholastic sciences he establishes in this seminary a teacher of humanity The business of this preceptor is described with a particularity not usual in the constitutions  given to collegiate bodies of this kind and he is directed to exert his utmost diligence in tincturing his auditors with a just reli  h for the graces and purity of the Latin language  "Latini sermonis ornatu et elegantia imbuendos diligenter curabit c"  Statut Coll Trin Oxon cap iv Again  "Cupiens et ego Collegii mei juventutem  in primis  Latini sermonis  Purita  e  ac  ingenurarum  artium rudimentis convenienter erudiri c"  Ibid cap xv  and to explain critically in the public hall for the space of two hours every day the Offices De Oratore and rhetorical treatises of Cicero the institutes of Quintilian Aulus Gellius Plautus Terence Virgil Horace Livy and Lucan together with the most excellent modern philological treatises then in vogue such as the ELEGANCIES of Laurentius Valla and the MISCELLANIES of Politian or any other approved critical tract on oratory or versification  Ibid cap xv A modern writer in dialectics Rodolphus Agricola is also recommended to be explained by the reader in philosophy together with Aristotle  In the mean time the founder permits it to the discretion of the lecturer occasionally to substitute Greek authors in the place of these  Ibid cap xv It may be also observed here that the philosophy reader is not only ordered to explain Aristotle but Plato Ibid cap xv It appears by implication in the close of this statute that the public lectures of the university were now growing usel  ss and dwindling into mere matters of form viz  "Ad hunc modum Domi meos LECTIONIBUS er  diri cupiens  os a publicis in Academia lectionibus avocar  noluiVerum si temporis tractu et magistratuum i  curia adeo a primario instituto degenerent Magi  rorum regentium Lectiones ordinariae ut inde null  aut

vacation in composing declamations and Latin verses both  lyric and heroic  bid cap xv Every day after dinner  "Aliquis scholarium a Praefidente aut Lectore Rhetorico jussus de themate quodam propo  ito ad edendum  ing  nii  ac profectus sui specimen diligenter  orn  t    ac breviter dicat c"  Ibid  ap x  and in his prefatory statute where he describes the nature and design of his foundation he declares that he destines the younger part of his establishment not only to dialectics and philosophy but to the more polite literature  "Caeteri autem  scholare  nuncupati POLITIORI  US Literis c"  Ibid cap i  The statutes of this college were submitted to the inspection of cardinal Pole one of the chief protectors of the revival of polite letters in England as appears from a curious passage in a letter written by the founder now remaining which not only displays the cardinal's ideas of the new erudition but shews the state of the Greek language at this period  "My lord Cardinalls grace has had the overseeinge of my statutes He muche lykes well that I have therein ordered the Latin tonge Latin classics to be redde to my schollers But he advyses me to order the Greeke to be more taught there than I have provyded This purpose I well lyke but I fear  the tymes will not bear it now  I remember when I was a yong scholler at Eton  About the year  the Greeke tonge was growing apace the studie of which is now alate much decaid  Dated See LIFE of sir Thomas Pope p  "  Queen Mary was herself eminently learned But her accomplishments in letters were darkened or impeded by religious prejudices At the desire of queen Catharine Parr she translated in her youth Erasmus's paraphrase on saint John The preface is written by Udall master of Eton school in which he much extolls her distinguished proficience in literature  Lond fol  It would have been fortunate if Mary's attention to this work had softened her temper and enlightened her understanding She frequently spoke in public with propriety and always with prudence and dignity  In the beginning of the reign of queen Elisabeth which soon followed when the return of protestantism might have been expected to produce a speedy change for the better puritanism began to prevail and as the first fervours of a new sect are always violent retarded for some time the progress of ingenuous and useful knowledge The scriptures being translated into English and every man assuming a right to dictate in matters of faith and to chuse his own principles weak heads drew false conclusions and erected an infinite variety of petty religions Such is the abuse which attends the best designs that the meanest reader of the new Testament thought he had a full comprehension of the most mysterious metaphysical doctrines in the christian faith and scorned to acquiesce in the sober and rational expositions of such difficult subjects which he might have received from a competent and intelligent teacher whom it was his duty to follow The bulk of the people who now possessed the means of discussing all theological topics from their situation and circumstances in life were naturally averse to the splendor the dominion and the opulence of an hierarchy and disclaimed the yoke of episcopal jurisdiction The new deliverance from the numerous and burthensome superstitions of the papal communion drove many pious reformers into the contrary extreme and the rage of opposition ended in a devotion entirely spiritual and abstracted External forms were abolished as impediments to the visionary reveries of a mental intercourse with heaven and because the church of Rome had carried ceremonies to an absurd excess the use of any ceremonies was deemed unlawful The love of new doctrines and a new worship the triumph of gaining proselytes and the persecutions which accompanied these licentious zealots all contributed to fan the flame of enthusiasm The genius of this refined and false species of religion which defied the salutary checks of all human authority when operating in its full force  was attended with consequences not less pernicious to society although less likely to last than those which flowed from the establishment of the antient superstitions During this unsettled state of things the English reformed clergy who had fled into Germany from the menaces of queen Mary returned home in great numbers and in consideration of their sufferings and learning and their abilities to vindicate the principles of a national church erected in opposition to that of Rome many of them were preferred to bishopricks and other eminent ecclesiastical stations These divines brought back with them into England those narrow principles concerning churchgovernment and ceremonies which they had imbibed in the petty states and republics abroad where the Calvinistic discipline was adopted and where they had lived like a society of philosophers but which were totally inconsistent with the nature of a more extended church established in a great and magnificent nation and requiring an uniform system of policy a regular subordination of officers a solemnity of public worship and an observance of exterior institutions They were however in the present circumstances thought to be the most proper instruments to be employed at the head of ecclesiastical affairs not only for the purpose of vindicating the new establishment by argument and authority but of eradicating every trace of the papal corruptions by their practice and example and of effectually fixing the reformation embraced by the church of England on a durable basis But unfortunately this measure specious and expedient as it appeared at first tended to destroy that constitution which it was designed to support and to counteract those principles which had been implanted by Cranmer in the reformed system of our religion Their reluctance or refusal to conform in a variety of instances to the established ceremonies and their refinements in theological discipline filled the church with the most violent divisions and introduced endless  intricate disputations not on fundamental doctrines of solid importance to the real interests of christianity but on positive points of idle and empty speculation which admitting no elegance of composition and calling forth no vigour of abilities exercised the learning of the clergy in the most barbarous and barren field of controversial divinity and obstructed every pursuit of polite or manly erudition Even the conforming clergy from their want of penetration and from their attachment to authorities contributed to protract these frivolous and unbecoming controversies for if in their vindication of the sacerdotal vestments and of the cross of baptism instead of arguing from the jews the primitive christians the fathers councils and customs they had only appealed to common sense and the nature of things the propriety and expediency of those formalities would have been much more easily and more clearly demonstrated To these inconveniencies we must add that the common ecclesiastical preferments were so much diminished by the seizure and alienation of impropriations in the late depredations of the church and which continued to be carried on with the same spirit of rapacity in the reign of Elisabeth that few persons were regularly bred to the church or in other words received a learned education Hence almost any that offered themselves were without distinction or examination admitted to the sacred function Insomuch that in the year an injunction was directed to the bishop of London from his metropolitan requiring him to forbear ordaining any more artificers and other illiterate persons who exercised secular occupations  Strype's GRINDAL B i ch iv b  But as the  vil was unavoidable this caution took but little effect  Numerous illuminated artificers began  arly to preach and write in defence of the reformed religion The first mechanic who left his lawful calling to vindicate the cause of the catholics was one Miles Hoggard a shoemaker or hosier of London who in the reign of queen Mary wrote a pamphlet entitled  The Displaying o  prote  ants and  ondry their practices  c Lond mo This piece soon acquired importance by being answered by Lawrence Humphries and other eminent reformers He printed other pieces of the same tendency He was likewise an English poet and I am glad of this opportunity of mentioning him in that character as I could not have ventured to give him a place in the series of our poetry He wrote the MIRROUR of LOVE Lond to Dedicated to queen Mary Also the PATHWAY to THE TOWRE of PERFECTION  Lond to with some other pieces    About the year t  ere were only two divines and those of higher rank the president of Magdalen college  Doctor Lawrence Humphreys mentioned in the last note Of whom it will not be improper to observe further in this place that about the year he wrote an  Epistola de Grecis literis et Homeri lectione et imitatione ad praesidem et socios collegii Magdalenae Oxon  In the CORNUCOPIA of Hadrian Junius Basil fol  and the dean of Christ Church who were capable of preaching the public sermons before the university of Oxford  Wood ut supr i  I will mention one instance of the extreme ignorance of our inferiour clergy about the middle of the sixteenth century In the year Horne bishop of Winchester enjoined the minor canons of his cathedral to get by memory every week one chapter of saint Paul's epistles in Latin and this formidable task almost beneath the abilities of an ordinary schoolboy was actually repeated by some of them before the bishop dean and prebendaries at a public episcopal visitation of that church  Registr Horne Episc Winton fol b  It is well known that a set of homilies was published to supply their incapacity in composing sermons but it should be remembered that one reason for prescribing this authorised system of doctrine was to prevent preachers from disturbing the peace of the church by disseminating their own novel and indigested opinions  The taste for Latin composition in the reign of Elisabeth notwithstanding it was fashionable both to write and speak in that language was much worse than in the reign of Henry the eighth when juster models were studied and when the novelty of classical literature excited a general emulation to imitate the Roman authors The Latinity of Ascham's prose has little elegance The versification and phraseology of  Buchanan's Latin poetry are splendid and sonorous but not marked with the chaste graces and simple ornaments of the Augustan age One is surprised to find the learned archbishop Grindal in the statutes of a school which he founded and amply endowed recommending such barbarous and degenerate classics as Palingenius Sedulius and Prudentius to be taught in his new foundation  Strype's GRINDAL B ii ch xvii p This was in iu  These indeed were the classics of a reforming bishop but the wellmeaning prelate would have contributed much more to the success of his intended reformation by directing books of better taste and less piety That classical literature and the public institution of youth were now in the lowest state we may collect from a provision in archbishop Parker's foundation of three scholarships at Cambridge in the year He orders that the scholars who are appointed to be elected from three the most considerable schools in Kent and Norfolk shall be  "the  best  and  aptest  schollers well instructed in the grammar and  if it may be  such as  can make a verse  Blomefield's NORFOLK ii  "  It became fashionable in this reign to study Greek at court The maids of honour indulged their ideas of sentimental affection in the sublime contemplations of Plato's Phaedo and the queen who understood Greek better than the canons of Windsor and was certainly a much greater pedant than her successor James the first translated Isocrates  Ascham's SCHOLEMASTER p b edit Aud EPISTOL lib i p ut supr  But this passion for the Greek language soon ended where it began nor do we find that it improved the national taste or influenced the writings of the age of Elisabeth  All changes of rooted establishments especially of a national religion are attended with shocks and convulsions unpropitious to the repose science and study But these unavoidable inconveniencies last not long When the liberal genius of protestantism had perfected its work and the first  anaticisms of wellmeaning but misguided zealot  had subsided every species of useful and elegant knowledge recovered its strength and arose with new vigour Acquisitions whether in theology or humanity were no longer exclusively confined to the clergy the laity eagerly embraced those pursuits from which they had long been unjustly restrained and soon after the reign of Elisabeth men attained that state of general improvement and those situations with respect to literature and life in which they have ever since persevered  But it remains to bring home and to apply this change in the sentiments of mankind to our main subject The customs institutions traditions and religion of the middle ages were favorable to poetry Their pageaunts processions spectacles and ceremonies were friendly to imagery to personification and allegory Ignorance and superstition so opposite to the real interests of human society are the parents of imagination The very devotion of the Gothic times was romantic The catholic worship besides that its numerous exteriour appendages were of a picturesque and even of a poetical nature disposed the mind to a state of deception and encouraged or rather authorised every species of credulity its visions miracles and legends propagated a general propensity to the Marvellous and strengthened the belief of spectres demons witches and incantations These illusions were heightened by churches of a wonderful mechanism and constructed on such principles of inexplicable architecture as had a tendency to impress the soul with every false sensation of religious fear The savage pomp and the capricious heroism of the baronial manners were replete with incident adventure and enterprise and the intractable genius of the feudal policy held forth those irregularities of conduct discordancies of interest and dissimilarities of situation that framed rich materials for the minstrelmuse The tacit compact of fashion which promotes civility by  diffusing habits of uniformity and therefore destroys peculiarities of character and situation had not yet operated upon life nor had domestic convenience abolished unwieldy magnificence Literature and a better sense of things not only banished these barbarities but superseded the mode of composition which was formed upon them Romantic poetry gave way to the force of reason and inquiry as its own inchanted palaces and gardens instantaneously vanished when the christian champion displayed the shield of truth and baffled the charm of the necromancer The study of the classics together with a colder magic and a tamer mythology introduced method into composition and the universal ambition of rivalling those new patterns of excellence the faultless models of Greece and Rome produced that bane of invention IMITATION Erudition was made to act upon genius Fancy was weakened by reflection and philosophy The fashion of treating every thing scientifically applied speculation and theory to the arts of writing Judgment was advanced above imagination and rules of criticism were established The brave eccentricities of original genius and the daring hardiness of native thought were intimidated by metaphysical sentiments of perfection and refinement Setting aside the consideration of the more solid advantages which are obvious and are not the distinct object of our contemplation at present the lover of true poetry will ask what have we gained by this revolution It may be answered much good sense good taste and good criticism But in the mean time we have lost a set of manners and a system of machinery more suitable to the purposes of poetry than those which have been adopted in their place We have parted with extravagancies that are above propriety with incredibilities that are more acceptable than truth and with fictions that are more valuable than reality  END OF THE SECOND VOLUME

Henry the second wrote a French SANGREAL which he translated from Latin by the command of that monarch Under the idea that Walter Mapes was a writer on this subject and in the fabulous way some critics may be induced to think that the WALTER archdeacon of Oxford from whom Geoffrey of Monmouth professes to have received the materials of his history was this Walter Mapes and not Walter Calenius who was also an eminent scholar and an archdeacon of Oxford See vol i p Geoffrey says in his Dedication to Robert earl of Gloucester  "Finding nothing said in Bede or Gildas of king Arthur and his su  cessours although their actions highly deserved to be recorded in writing and are orally celebrated by the British bards I was much surprised at so strange an omission At length Walter archdeacon of Oxford a man of great eloquence and learned in foreign histories offered me an ancient book in the British or Armorican tongue which in one unbroken story and an elegant diction related the deeds of the British kings from Brutus to Cadwallader At his request although unused to rhetorical flourishes and contented with the simplicity of my own plain language I undertook the translation of that book into Latin"  B i ch i See also B xii ch xx Some writers suppose that Geoffrey pretended to have received his materials  from archdeacon Walter by way of authenticating his romantic history These notices seem to disprove that suspicion In the year a French romance was published in two magnificent folio volumes entitled HISTOIRE  de  ROY ARTUS  et des  CHEVALIERS  de la  TABLE

the garden and singing is seen and heard first by Arcite who immediately calls Palamon They are both equally and at the same point of time captivated with her beauty yet without any expressions of jealousy or appearance of rivalry But in Chaucer's management of the commencement of this amour Palamon by seeing Emilia first acquires an advantage over Arcite which ultimately renders the catastrophe more agreeable to poetical justice It is an unnatural and unanimated picture which Boccacio presents of the two young princes violently enamoured of the same object and still remaining in a state of amity In Chaucer the quarrel between the two friends the foundation of all the future beautiful distress of the piece commences at this moment and causes a conversation full of mutual rage and resentment This rapid transition from a friendship cemented by every tie to the most implacable hostility is on this occasion not only highly natural but produces a sudden and unexpected change of circumstances which enlivens the detail and is always interesting Even afterwards when Arcite is released from the prison by Perithous he embraces Palamon at parting And in the fifth book of the THESEIDE when Palamon goes armed to the grove in search of Arcite whom he finds  sleeping they meet on terms of much civility and friendship and in all the mechanical formality of the manners of romance In Chaucer this dialogue has a very different cast Palamon at seeing Arcite feels a  colde swerde  glide throughout his heart he starts from his ambuscade and instantly salutes Arcite with the appellation of  false traitour  And although Boccacio has merit in discriminating the characters of the two princes by giving Palamon the impetuosity of Achilles and Arcite the mildness of Hector yet Arcite by Boccacio is here injudiciously represented as too moderate and pacific In Chaucer he returns the salute with the same degree of indignation draws his sword and defies Palamon to single combat So languid is Boccacio's plan of this amour that Palamon does not begin to be jealous of Arcite till he is informed in the prison that Arcite lived as a favorite servant with Theseus in disguise yet known to Emilia When the lovers see Emilia from the window of their tower she is supposed by Boccacio to observe them and not to be displeased at their signs of admiration This circumstance is justly omitted by Chaucer as quite unnecessary and not tending either to promote the present business or to operate in any distant consequences On the whole Chaucer has eminently shewn his good sense and judgement in rejecting the superfluities and improving the general arrangement of the story He frequently corrects or softens Boccacio's false manners and it is with singular address he has often abridged the Italian poet's ostentatious and pedantic parade of antient history and mythology  Pag l READ  "sharpe"  Pag l For  "boris"  READ  "beris"  Pag Not  c  l For  "wende"

myself on a subject materially affecting the system of criticism that has been formed on Chaucer's works I have never affirmed that Chaucer imitated the Provencial bards although it is by no means improbable that he might have known their tales But as the peculiar nature of the Provencial poetry entered deeply into the substance cast and character of some of those French and Italian models which he is allowed to have followed he certainly may be said to have copied although not immediately the  matter  and  manner  of these writers I have called his HOUSE OF FAME originally a Provencial composition I did not mean that it was written by a Provencial troubadour but that Chaucer's original was compounded of the capricious mode of fabling and that extravagant style of fiction which constitute the essence of the Provencial poetry As to the  FLOURE AND THE LEAFE which Dryden pronounces to have been composed  after their manner  it is framed on the old allegorising spirit of the Provencial writers refined and disfigured by the fopperies of the French poets in the fourteenth century The ideas of these fablers had been so strongly imbibed that they continued to operate long

containing some of Gower's poems in Latin French and English By an entry in the first leaf in the handwriting and under the signature of Thomas lord Fairfax Cromwell's general an antiquarian and a lover and collector of curious manuscripts  He gave twentynine antient manuscripts to the Bodleian library one of which is a beautiful manuscript of Gower's Confessio Aman  is When the Recordtower in S Mary's abbey at York was accidentally blown up in the grand rebellion he offered rewards to the soldiers who could bring him fragments of the scattered parchments Luckily however the numerous original evidences lodged in this repository had been just before transcribed by Roger Dodsworth and the transcripts which formed the groundwork of Dugdale's MONASTICON consisting of for  ynine large folio volumes were bequeathed by Fairfax to the same library Fairfax also when Oxford was garrisoned by the parliamentary forces exerted his utmost diligence in preserving the Bodleian library from pillage so that it suffered much less than when that city was in the possession of the royalists  it appears that this book  was presented by the poet Gower about the year to Henry the fourth and that it was given by lord Fairfax to his  friend and kinsman  sir Thomas Gower knight and baronet in the year By another entry lord Fairfax acknowledges to have received it in the same year as a present from  that learned gentleman  Charles Gedde esquire of saint Andrews in Scotland and at the end are five or six Latin anagrams on Gedde written and signed by lord Fairfax with this title  "In NOMEN

"Rex coeli deus et dominus qui tempora solus"  MSS COTTON OTHO D i This is followed by ten other very short pieces both in French and English of the same tendencyIII CINKANTE BALADES or Fifty Sonnets

curious and valuable part of lord Gower's manuscript They are not mentioned by those who have written the life of this poet or have catalogued his works Nor do they appear in any other manuscript of Gower which I have examined But if they should be discovered in any other I will venture to pronounce that a more authentic unembarrassed and practicable copy than this before us will not be produced although it is for the most part unpointed and obscured with abbreviations and with those mispellings which flowed from a scribe unacquainted with the French language  To say no more however of the value which these little pieces may derive from being so scarce and so little known they have much real and intrinsic merit They are tender pathetic and poetical and place our old poet Gower in a more advantageous point of view than that in which he has hitherto been usually seen I know not if any even among the French poets themselves of this period have left a set of more finished sonnets for they were probably written when Gower was a young man about the year Nor had yet any English poet treated the passion of love with equal delic  cy of sentiment and elegance of composition I will

and complete edition of his Poems appeared Had I been apprised of that publication I should have been much more sparing in my specimens of these forgeries which had been communicated to me in manuscript and which I imagined I was imparting to my readers as curiosities I had as yet seen only a few extracts of these poems nor were those transcripts which I received always exact Circumstances which I mention here to shew the inconveniencies under which I laboured both with regard to my citations and my criticisms These scanty materials however contained sufficient evidence to convince me that the pieces were not genuine  The entire and accurate collection of Rowlie's now laid before the public has been so little instrumental in inducing me to change my opinion that it has served to exemplify and confirm every argument which I have produced in support of my  suspicions of an imposition It has likewise afforded some new proofs  Those who have been conversant in the works even of the best of our old English poets well know that one of their leading characteristics is inequality In these writers splendid descriptions ornamental comparisons poetical images and striking thoughts occur but rarely for many pages together they are tedious prosaic and uninteresting On the contrary the poems before us are every where supported they are throughout poetical and animated They have no imbecillities of style or sentiment Our old English bards abound in unnatural conceptions strange imaginations and even the most ridiculous absurdities But Rowlie's poems present us with no incongruous combinations no mixture of manners institutions customs and characters They appear to have been composed after ideas of discrimination had taken place and when even common writers had begun to conceive on most subjects with precision and propriety There are indeed in the BATTLE OF HASTINGS some great anachronisms and practices are mentioned which did not exist till afterwards But these are such inconsistencies as proceeded from fraud as well as ignorance they are such as no old poet could have possibly fallen into and which only betray an unskilful imitation of antient manners The verses of Lydgate and his immediate successors are often rugged and unmusical but Rowlie's poetry sustains one uniform tone of harmony and if we brush away the asperities of the antiquated spelling conveys its cultivated imagery in a polished and agreeable strain of versification Chatterton seems to have thought that the distinction of old from modern poetry consisted only in the use of old words In counterfeiting the coins of a rude age he did not forget the usual application of an artificial rust but this disguise was not sufficient to conceal the elegance of the workmanship  The BATTLE OF HASTINGS just mentioned might be proved to be a palpable forgery for many other reasons It is  said to be translated from the Saxon of Turgot But Turgot died in and the battle of Hastings was fought in We will however allow that Turgot lived in the reign of the Conqueror But on that supposition is it not extraordinary that a cotemporary writer should mention no circumstances of this action which we did not know before and which are not to be found in Malmsbury Ordericus Vitalis and other antient chroniclers Especially as Turgot's description of this battle was professedly a detached and separate performance and at least on that account would be minute and circumstantial An original and a cotemporary writer describing this battle would not only have told us something new but would otherwise have been full of particularities The poet before us dwells on incidents common to all battles and such as were easily to be had from Pope's HOMER We may add that this piece not only detects itself but demonstrates the spuriousness of all the rest Chatterton himself allowed the first part of it to be a forgery of his own The second part from what has been said could not be genuine And he who could write the second part was able to write every line in the whole collection But while I am speaking of this poem I cannot help exposing the futility of an argument which has been brought as a decisive evidence of its originality It is urged that the names of the chiefs who accompanied the Conqueror correspond with the Roll of BattleAbbey As if a modern forger could not have seen this venerable record But unfortunately it is printed in Hollinshead's Chronicle  It is said that Chatterton on account of his youth and education could not write these poems This may be true but it is no proof that they are not forged Who was their author on the hypothesis that Rowlie was not is a new and another question I am however of opinion that it was Chatterton For if we attend only to some of the pieces now extant in a periodical magazine which he published under his own signature and which are confessedly of his composition to his  letters now remaining in manuscript and to the testimony of those that were acquainted with his conversation he will appear to have been a singular instance of a prematurity of abilities to have acquired a store of general information far exceeding his years and to have possessed that comprehension of mind and activity of understanding which predominated over his situations in life and his opportunities of instruction Some of his publications in the magazines discover also his propensity to forgery and more particularly in the walk of antient manners which seem greatly to have struck his imagination These among others are ETHELGAR a  Saxon poem  in prose KENRICK  translated from the Saxon  CERDICH  translated from the Saxon  GODRED CROVAN a Poem  composed by Dothnel Syrric king of the isle of Man  The HIRLAS  composed by Blythyn prince of North Wales  GOTHMUND  translated from the Saxon  ANECDOTE of CHAUCER and of the ANTIQUITY of CHRISTMAS GAMES The latter piece in which he quotes a register of Keinsham NUNNERY which was a priory of Black canons and advances many imaginary facts strongly shews his track of reading and his fondness for antiquarian imagery In this monthly collection he inserted ideal drawings of six achievements of Saxon heraldry of an inedited coin of queen Sexburgeo wife of king Kinewalch and of a Saxon amulet with explanations equally fantastic and arbitrary From Rowlie's pretended parchments he produced several heraldic delineations He also exhibited a draught by Rowlie of Bristol castle in its perfect state I very much doubt if this fortress was not almost totally ruinous in the reign of Edward the fourth This draught however was that of an edifice evidently fictitious It was exceedingly ingenious but it was the representation of a building which never existed in a capricious and affected style of Gothic architecture reducible to no period or system  To the whole that is here suggested on this subject let us add Chatterton's inducements and qualifications for forging these poems arising from his character and way of living He  was an adventurer a professed hireling in the trade of literature full of projects and inventions artful enterprising unprincipled indigent and compelled to subsist by expedients  Pag To Not  b  ADD  "In the British Museum there is a poem entitled  "A CRISTEMASSE GAME  made by maister  BENET  howe God Almyghty seyde

and a preface on this species of poetry by Gibson at Oxford  to    Pag ADD to the last Note  "Friar Tuck is h  wever mentioned in Skelton's play of MAGNIFICEN  f b  Another b  d  shave halfe my berde

MAGNIFICENCE now remaining printed by Rastal without date in a thin folio has been most obligingly communicated to me by Mr Garrick whose  valuable collection of old Plays is alone a complete history of our stage The first leaf and the title are wanting It contains sixty folio pages in the black letter and must have taken up a very considerable time in the representation See p supr The substance of the allegory is briefly this MAGNIFICENCE becomes a dupe to his servants and favorites  Fansy Counterfe  Countenance Crafty Conveyance Clokyd Colusion Courtly Abusion  and  Foly  At length he is seized and robbed by  Adversyte  by whom he is given up as a prisoner to  Poverte  He is next delivered to  Despare  and  Mischefe  who offer him a knife and a halter He snatches the knife to end his miseries by stabbing himself when  Good Hope  and  Redresse  appear and persuade him to take the  rubarbe of repentance  with some  gostly gummes  and a few  drammes  of  devocyon  He becomes acquainted with  Circumspeccyon  and  Perseverance  follows their directions and seeks for happiness in a state of penitence and contrition There is some humour here and there in the dialogue but the allusions are commonly low The poet hardly ever aims at allegorical painting but the the figure of POVERTY is thus drawn fol xxiii a  A my bonys ake my lymmys be sore  A lasse I haue the cyatyca full euyll in my hyppe  A lasse where is youth that was wont for to skyppe  I am lowsy and vnlykynge and full of scurffe  My coloure is tawnycoloured as a turffe  I am POVERTIE that all men doth hate  I am baytyd with doggys at euery mannys gate  I am raggyd and rent as ye may se  Full few but they have envy at me  Nowe must I this carcase lyft up  He dyned with DELYTE with POVERTE he must sup  The stagedirection then is  "Hic accedat at levandum MAGNIFICENCE"  It is not impossible that DESPARE offering  the knife and the halter might give a distant hint to Spenser The whole piece is strongly marked with Skelton's manner and contains every species of his capricious versification  Counterfet Countenance  says f vi a  But nowe wyll I  In  bastarde  ryme of  doggreil  gyse  Tell you where of my name doth ryse  I have been prolix in describing these two dramas because they place Skelton in a class in which he never has yet been viewed that of a Dramatic poet And although many MORALITIES were now written yet these are the first that bear the name of their author There is often much real comedy in these ethic interludes and their exemplifications of Virtue and Vice in the abstract convey strokes of character and pictures of life and manners I take this opportunity of remarking that a MORALITYMAKER was a professed occupation at Paris Pierre Gringoire is called according to the style of his age  Compositeur Historien et Facteur de Mysteres ou Comedies  in which he was also a performer His principal piece written at the command of Louis the twelfth in consequence of a quarrel
