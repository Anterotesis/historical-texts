the approbation of the Public the writer was induced to collect them into a volume and as he will pursue the subject in the  Ledger  should this volume have success he will shortly publish another  SENTIMENTAL EXCURSIONS  I Read and read but could not retain a word of what I readSo many friends flowed in upon me daily to breakfast and so many friends to carry me out to dine that to understand the doctrine of  descents  the point I was studying was impossible I must cut off said I the  entail  of these engagements and become master of my own time  Returning from the  Grecian  at one in the morning I ordered my servants to pack up my cloaths with a few books and at six he with my portmanteau on his shoulders and I with  Lord Coke  under one arm with whom I intended to comment upon  old  law and Sir James Burrow from whom I expected instruction  in  new  law under the other  I do not understand what our journalist here means by his distinction between  old  and  new  law the efficient principles of law are  immutable  the  coincidents  are the same therefore modern determinations should  coincide  with ancient adjudications otherwise notwithstanding the  coexistence  of legal principles which I have proved  somewhere  to be at least  coequal  with nature itself judgments upon the same principles would be deficient in  cooperation  Lord Coke's Reports are called the  gospel  of the law Sir James Burrow's Reports may be stiled the  Apocalypse  of the law and as for my reports I am determined to have them called the  Apocrypha  Of the law  C L ** T  set off for the Windsor stage  The coach was empty so ordering my man to mount the outside and going inside myself after musing a few minutes on the great progress I should make in the  art  and science of jurisprudence during the vacation between  Easter  and  Trinity term  I folded my arms within each other having first wrapped myself in a large cloak threw myself along the seat and wishing farewel to London to all the pleasures of London and to all its temptations fell into a profound slumber  THE HIGHWAYMAN  THIS was in the merry month of May when the whole animal creation from the minutest insect the microscope discovers upon the leaf to the largest beast which grazes in the field or preys in the forest when the fowls of the air from the diminutive humming bird to the eagle of the sun when the fishes of the sea from the little sprat to the unwieldy leviathan pay implicit obedience to that divine ordinance of heaven  increase and multiply  I say it was in the month of May so justly stiled "the mother of love" when nature wears an universal smile when every plant and tree sprouts forth in bud and blossom and the whole earth is cloathed in variegated green being fast asleep in a stagecoach on the road to Windsor and my imagination having taken an excursion in a dream to visit  to converse with and to embrace some dear friends in Ireland I was disturbed from my sweet vision about five miles from London by a tremendous voice from the side of the road which with reiterated vociferation roared out Stop stop  My hands instinctively slipped into my breeches pocket and with a motion equally involuntary drew forth a small purse containing the small sum of one guinea and a few shillings to give the highwayman The coachman at the same instant drew up his horses  If any hero wishes to be informed why I did not rather apply to my pistolsI had none with me or if I had I should not have applied to them  Indeed instead of charging my pistols which I left hanging up in my chambers where may they long hang for ornaments I had prepared the small sum I have before mentioned and put it into the little purse aforesaid in case of being stopped for it has long been my opinion that if a man considers his  own interest in which undoubtedly his  peace of mind  has an intimate and large shareto part with what he can spare from his absolute necessities will appear preferable to risquing rise for a trifle It requires no great portion of humanity to conclude that to deprive a fellowcreature of life and dispatch his soul in the very act of sin to  that country from whose bourne no traveller returns  though compatible with earthly  justice  must be offensive to eternal  mercy  If this assertion be erroneous how comes it that the act of sacrificing a wretch's life in defence of a paltry sum always impresses upon the mind of the avenger a horror which amounts to punishment  As the coachdoor opened I put out my handhere my honest friend said I addressing myself to the highwayman here take my money  I received a shot in return for my courtesy  I say a shotbut not a shot from a pistol nor a shot from a blunderbussit was a chainshot  or a doubleheaded shot which you please discharged from a pair of as bright eyes as ever wounded the heart of an unwary traveller  The lady mistaking the offer of my hand which intended to convey my purse to the supposed highwayman for an offer to assist her into the carriage seized it with the most good humoured familiarity and fixing her right foot firm upon the coachstep raised her body up with a spring of agility which clearly proved elasticity was not the least property in her composition  Thus she stood in equilibrium nodding and smiling a farewel over her left shoulder to a male friend the person who had ordered the coach to stop and taking her seat exactly opposite to me she waved her hand out of the coach window to her parting companion the coachman with a  hoi hoi  and a crack of his whip informed his horses of their duty the horses obeyed and we drove on  THE POCKET HOOP  IT is astonishing that women will encumber their persons so as to alter the elegant symmetry of the human frameThe person of a fine woman is the most beautiful edifice in natureTrue beauty consists in simplicity and the figure of a wellmade female always shews to the best advantage when its ornaments are simpleit should never be embellished in the  composite  orderFrom the days of  figleaves  to the present time  art  has only laboured to disguise nature  History informs us that Queen Elizabeth was remarkable for the protuberance of  the rotunda  and this say the antiquarians in dress first introduced the fashion of hoops But whether this  rotunda  was a  permanent rotunda behind  natural to the make of her Majesty or a  temporary  rotunda  before  arising from a  natural cause  authors are silent  Hoops are of much greater antiquity than our author seems to have a knowledge ofThey were worn by the Greeks and Romans Queen Elizabeth's hoop was called a  farthingal  it gave rise to  scandal  but to keep her Majesty in countenance the whole court assumed  big bellies  which soon became the general pink of the mode This courtly condescension to the Virgin Queen has nothing particular in it When Queen Anne had a lame leg the women of fashion carried crutchsticks and not many years past the late French King being forced to cut off the foretop of his hair on account of a  scaldhead  not only the nobility and gentry of France but the nobility and gentry of GreatBritain and Ireland cropped their upper locks close to the scull When Henry VIII in cut his hair short all England followed his example  Camer Oper Subcisio Cent  C CTTRL  The divine writer Isaiah describes the Jewish ladies of his time in an attire so exactly similar to that which distinguishes the modern English ladies of the  ton  that one would imagine he was prophesying of their dress He mentions their stomachers and their towering heads their curls their flowing garments and their crispingpins Solomon too who having the experience of five hundred wives and fifteen hundred concubines and of course must have been well acquainted with the influence of the female over the male sex in his admonitions to youth cautions them to beware of the rustling of silks and the creeking of heels for it leads toit led Solomon the wisest of mankind from the worship of the Almighty God to the sacrifice of idols  MADAN D D    A hoop says an old writer is an airy cool dressThat may be answers a modern writer arguing upon the same subjectbut how comes it to pass that Queen Elizabeth who was a  virgin  Queen and her  maids  of  honour  who were  virgins  by  virtue  of their office should require more cooling than their grandmothers Now the question is very easily answeredQueen Elizabeth and her  maids  of honour were  virgins  their grandmothers certainly were not  I suppose Sir said my fellowtraveller we shall breakfast here as the coach stopped at the  Star and Garter  at KewbridgeI leaped out and gave the lady my handshe sprung forward but the treacherous hoop crossing the door of the coach gave so sudden a jerk to the lady that as she sprung she fell and as she fell of course the hoop became inversed as you may have seen an umbrella or  parasol  on a windy dayshe slipped from under her garmentsHeaven preserve us  I fixed my eyes upon the  sign  It is the  Star and Garter  said I to myself in an under  voice and in the same tone I read the motto  HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE  I kept my eyes fixed upon the  sign  without once attempting to extricate the lady Had it been the sign of the  Gorgon  's head I could not have been more  petrified  but my man who had now descended from the roof of the coach having more presence of mind entered the coach at the opposite door and taking the lady by the shoulders gently pulled her backwards while I smoothed her cloaths and brought the villainous hoop to its primitive situation  The lady having adjusted her drapery came out sideways  I led her into the house and being shewn into a roomshe cursed her hoop in a tone of bitterness infinitely more vindictive than the curse itselfbut how could I say  Amen  I considered myself under some obligations to  the object of her curses "so  amen  stuck in my throat  SeragliosSpanish protections I tell you they are nothing to the English hoop Confinement stimulates a woman to do that which otherwise would never enter her headand pray Sir did you ever hear that a  padlock  could protect a  leathern  portmanteau from the plundering hand of a robber I tell you no woman has her chastity so well fortified as an English woman of the present day Who the devil can approach her In the rear she carries  bastions  of corkin front she has  crownworks  of whaleboneon the right and left  flanks  and  gorgeats  nothing is wanting to compleat the strength of the place but a  tenaille  in the  ditch  But if the fashion continues Sir we shall never be able to carry a point by  storm  True and therein lies the safety of female chastity for all approaches must now be carried on by  sap  whenever a lady commits  faux pas  in the daytimedo you mind in the daytime she must never more blame her stars or attempt to excuse the transgression by the suddenness of the attack as so many preparatory  manoeuvres  are necessary to the  dismantling  of the place  Now the daughter of the old General who was making these wise remarks upon the utility of hoops was preparing for bed in an adjacent room and by clapping a hand to each hip and drawing a slipknot overturned every thing her father saidfor down came the  fortification  with the  bastions  and the  crownworks  flap upon the floor I wish said the young lady slipping under the bedcloaths my father's wish would succeedI wish it was the fashion for every woman to have a  tenaille  in the ditch  TOBY  "  It was all my own fault said the lady I should have come out sideways at firstBut the way you attempted to come Madam said I was the most  natural  True she replied but not the most  fortunate  our  natural  movements seldom are said Itill this instant I considered  hoops  as protections from such accidents replied the lady but I now perceive they render one's  motions  very  unnatural  so saying she retired Breakfast was served in the lady returned divested of her hoop her dimity jacket fitted her shape exactly her petticoat hung in foldsan elegant  neglegee  appearance marked her personthe conscious tint upon her cheek indexed the continuance of her confusionWe breakfasted and having ascended the carriage with caution and taken our seats without further accident pursued our journey  Though the air in the month of May is more congenial to the blood and more invigorating to the constitution of all animals than the air of any other month in the year  yet man or woman after long residence in the metropolis the pores being open and the muscles being relaxed by the heat of full theatres balls routs masquerades ridottos close rooms and seacoal fires will find the morning breeze of the country too sharp for their unbraced nerves and debilitated joints  This was my caseI perceived my fair companion also shrunk from the acuteness of the biting air and sought comfortable warmth in closely wrapping round her a pale pink sattin cloak lined with sable fur  I don't know a more pleasing  contrast  than  pink  faced with  black  and the lining of the lady's cloak formed such a contrast the  black fur  with which it was lined turning over the edge of the  pink sattin  like a  facing  or lapel  Scarlet faced with black has been the uniform of the bravest troops it was worn by  Ligonier  's horse who fought with such amazing courage at Dettingen and Fontenoy and is now worn by  the London Military Association    ANONYMOUS    Perceiving then that the lady not only indicated an aguish tremor but that sleep had shed his drowsy influence upon her lids which repeatedly dropped their "fringed curtains" over her eyesI proposed drawing up the coachblinds the lady complied  We both benefited by the precaution  The lady soon involuntarily resigned herself to the soft folding arms of sleep who fixed his leaden seal upon her eyesI exercised my mind in meditation  It has been said that sleep is the emblem of death The object I looked upon so far from raising this gloomy idea in me produced a quite contrary effectI thought of nothing but  life  and  prolongation of life  my thoughts arose from my  feelings  my feelings from what I sawbut my feelings were not merely  local  life trembled through the current of my blooddilated my heart inspired my soul expanded my thoughtswarmed my imagination to extasyand I answer for it spoke at my eyes  How easy would it have been at that instant to have  tickled  me to deathI should have shrunk from the touch like a sensitive plant  The lady slept on  A MEDITATION  THE scene at the inndoor when I innocently gazed up on the  Star and Garter  was fresh in my memory Not an astronomer of them all from Ptolemy the Egyptian down to Copernicus the German and from Copernicus the German down to Newton the Englishman had ever so strong a conception of the  hirsute  constellation called by  stargazers Berenice  's  locks  as I had of the  sign  at KewbridgeEvery object was painted upon my imagination in the most lively colours  I recollected the lady's confusion on the unfortunate event of her  pockethoop  and this recollection produced in my mind an investigation of  modesty  When an Indian was asked how he could go naked and expose his body to the cold air he answered  because I am all  face  Now the same answer would  have been as pertinent had it related to  modesty  instead of  feeling  for in those countries where the inhabitants go perfectly naked they look upon each other as undisturbed with as chaste an eye and unflushed countenance as if they were  all face  With them every part is equally indifferent as to sight the less  modesty  the less  feeling  the less  feeling  the less  incontinence  in thought in word and in deed  The  Lacedaemonians  were remarkable for  virtue  yet possessed very little  modesty  and when we compare their customs with the customs of the chearful happy inhabitants of the  southern isles  discovered by Captain Cooke it appears the Lacedaemonians were perfect  masters  and  mistresses  too of the celebrated  Timiradi dance  practised by the people of both sexes in  Otaheite  Plato after the example of several well instituted republicks ordained that the men and women of all ages should divest themselves of their cloathing and appear perfectly naked you will see the reason of it in his  Gymnastick  The women of  Pegu  wear no covering below the waist but a cloath slit up beforeThe Lacedaemonian women saw daily the Spartan youth perform their exercises naked and wore such slight garments themselves that as they walked discovered their thighs they being as Plato says sufficiently covered with their virtue MONTAIGNE  This might perhaps cool the sense of  seeing  but how did it affect  feelingSeeing's  believing but  feeling  has no  fellow    RAY'S PROVERB  It must be left to the judgment  of the ladies whether the daughter of  Cato  was right in her opinion that women should  take off  and  reassume  their  modesty  with their  garments  It is certain the Roman matron was a  patriot  not however of that class of  patriots  who ornament the  present times  she was not influenced by  self  but from a regard to  posterity  And where is the woman who has not a regard to  posterity  I answerthe woman who is not solely attached to  one  man has neither regard for  posterity  nor for  herself  and cannot be a patriot  Thus did I mentally philosophize till after long meditation I concluded with a modern voyager  Forster who attended Captain Cooke on his second voyage  who from the contemplation of unpolished people has drawn this opinion  that  modesty  and  chastity  which have long been supposed to be inherent in the human mind are local ideas unknown in the state of nature and modified according to the various degrees of civilization  Yet when  Adam  and  Eve  had eaten of the  forbidden fruit  plucked from the  tree of knowledge  they saw they were naked and were ashamed  Oh chastity thou art a great and shining virtue in civilized states Thy utility is sufficiently knownbut to govern and prevail with thee according to  nature  is as difficult as it is easy to do it according to  custom  Thou hast nothing let me tell thee pure and fair maid to support thy precepts but the hoary head and shrivelled face of ancient  use  And what is to be deduced from this Why that the fair fabrick of  chastity  was erected upon the  ruins  of the  bowers of paradise  But is not  chastity  in women the same as  courage  is in men Is not  chastity  the very  centre  of a  woman's  point of honour Is not female chastity a  castle  defended by religion morality  reason custom pride apprehension and shame True but when  nature  mutinies  within  and love attacks the  outworks  this welldefended  castle  is no more than  a castle in the air  THE EXAMINATION  THE lady slept on  I could not get a wink of sleep  The devil take that  sign  said I to myself cursing the  Star and Garter  at Kewbridge Yet why should I curse the  Star and Garter  Is it not an  insignia  which our most gracious sovereign respectswhich the first of our nobility are continually in pursuit ofAnd has not the learned Pettingall who was a master of arts thus delivered his opinion after quoting some hundred authorities in all languages that the  Star and Garter  are  amulets  or  charms  allegorical symbols of  unity  or as Camden and Heylin have it  a bond of the most  inward society  and a  badge  of  unity  and  concord  to inspire  courage  and  vigour  in men  and does he not say what every  true man  will join with him in saying  honi soit qui mal y pense  should be rendered  shame and confusion to him that designs any evil against the wearer that is the wearer of the  Star and Garter  may all his designs be retorted on the author  But why are the Bench of Bishops excluded from wearing this  amulet  Because they have  mitres  annexed to their  Bishopricks  and that amounts to the same  thing  and as to the lawyers why they have their  black  patches upon their  wigs  and their  scarlet  patches upon their  doctors  gownsand their  furs  for their judges robes delectable to the  touch  To banish the idea of the  sign  at  Kewbridge  I examined the lady's faceHer eyes were shuthere could I ramble through half a dozen pages expatiating on the beauty of the  eye  whether black hazel grey or blue whether open or closed whether shaded by a full grown  dark brow  or arched over with the smoothness of a  mouseskin  I never gave a determined preference to any particular colour only let it not be a jaundiced eyenor  a basilisk's eyeI hate bothbut I have long thought that the eye of a woman looks best when on the  twinkle  that is when it is neither open nor shut but like the setting sun skirted by a shading cloud emanates a lambient fire through the medium of bordering fringe with which nature has wisely provided it for the purposes of ornament and protection  Give me an eye with quivering beams dancing with irregularity like the reflection of the moon upon agitated water  Mr DE LOUTHERBOURG is under the necessity of acquainting the public as a duty he owes them as well as himself that he has not given his assent to the insertion of the above idea which is undoubtedly stolen from the moonlight scene in his EIDOPHUSIKON and is therefore an imposition on the public and an invasion of his property  Lislestreet Leicestersquare April      I was eighteen years of age when I first discovered that the perfection of beauty in the eye or rather the perfect force of the operations of the eye upon the  heart  is not to be found either when the eye is open or when  the eye is shut but when the eye is upon the  twinkle  The impression I then received was deep and I shall die in the opinion which was the result of it  The manner in which I received this impression may appear hereafter  A DESCRIPTION  THE lady slept onsmiled as she slept and as she smiled  she  sighed  Health sported upon her cheek while love with a most inticing grace diffused a nonresisting if not inviting complacency over every feature and wantoned on her neckHer lips smooth and red as coral pouted with fulness and with a glowing ripeness equal to the blush of the wild strawberry smooth as the sattin'd softness of the nectarine's coat divided to give emission to her breath discovering a set of teeth vying with orient pearl  Her breath  I sat opposite to herHer breath fanned me with a fragrance infinitely more inspiring not less odoriferous than the evening zephyr of June agitating a rosethicket stealing its  sweets  If Mrs DAWSON looks in her glass she will see an original resembling this picture  The effect however was different the fanning zephyr would have cooled but the southern blast that gathers consuming heat from the burning desert of Arabia could not scorch with more violence than the breath of my fellowtraveller  All appeared quiet within the peaceful habitation of her bosom which gently heaving preserved uninterrupted calmness except when a halfsuppressed sigh or short breathing broke in upon the regular serenity of its motion  She sighedbut her sighs were not the sighs of sorrowneither were they the sighs of painthey were the sighs of sensibilityand I discovered the nature of her sighs by the gentle agitations of pleasure which ever preceded their risings as tender harbingers or followed them as affectionate attendants  It is probable the lady was in a dream if she was it was a dream of such sensibility  she might be said to wake sleeping  Critics may object to this expression but it is certainly allowable at this time when the greatest men  sleep  waking  I do believe it to be true that dreams are certain interpreters of our inclinationsI dream but seldom and my dreams are generally produced by pleasant thoughtsMONTAIGNE  It is no wonder if those  things  which men think on have an affection for and practise when waking should agitate their minds when they are asleep CICERO  An Expostulation with  SLEEP  Why dost thou detain me so long from my friends Shall I never get free from the cells of delusive imaginationsShall I be for another hour dead to sentiment to the world and to myself When am I to walk out of thy yawning palace and be alive to action and joy once moreI will be revenged on thee for I will abhor the name of every thing that sooths and fawns upon me to become thy captive detested be the poppy and laudanum detested be the sparkling liquor that enervates the powers and thrice detested be the downy bedNever more may I become thy preyThe days of my life are but short and let them be spent in the improvements of  action  and in the service of my country and my friendsVain hope for I feel that I can no longer resist thy soporisic vengeance  Thus exclaims then sinks in silenceLD N  I drew a divination from her dream  THE WAGGON RUT  THE road was smooththe coach rolled onthe lady sleptbut as she slept she slipt  The cushion on which she sat gently gave wayperceiving her in danger of falling and anxious to prevent it I placed my feet close to her'sThis precaution immediately transferred the point of gravity from the feet to the knee and the coach continuing to communicate its motion to the lady no sooner were her feet stopped than her knees naturally bent forward  Determined to support her I gently slipt forward till our knees met  For above a mile we rolled along the road foot to foot knee to kneethe coach continuing to communicate motion to the lady the lady communicating motion to metill  unfortunately the road growing rough the motion increased and became irregularI lost my situationthe lady lost her situation of consequence  Still the lady sleptand smiledand sighedand slipped unconscious of her danger but the coachwheel slipping into a  waggonrut  I slipt forward the lady slipt downward and my  Lord Coke  who had lain unnoticed upon the seat ever since I came into the coach in the morning slipt down at the same instant with the lady but luckily reaching the bottom of the carriage first his lordship broke her fall  I did all in my power to support her but in vainthough the lady did every thing she could to support herself and my  Lord Coke  lent his assistance  The accident appeared beyond remedy So being on my knees I offered up a hasty yet warm sincere ejaculation to the great God of Love who lending an ear auspicious to my prayer in about two minutes I was extricated fromnonot extricated from my confusion  but extricated from my aukward position and found myself able to replace the lady in her seat  Having settled the lady I took up my  Lord Coke  and placed his lordship close by her  A REFLECTION  HAVING got out of the  rut  and having passed the  rough road  which caused the foregoing accident the coach rolled on smoothly again  Now there are many travellers who would rail for an hour without intermission against these  rough spots  which every man must sometimes meet upon his journey let him travel what road he willSome men meet them on  high roads  some men meet them on  bye roads  Some men meet them on mountains Some men meet them in  vallies  They interrupt the rich man in his chariot and the poor man on the humble footpath way Philosophers have met these  rough spots  upon the summit of the Alps the  virtuosi  have met them in the streets of RomeNay it has been said that very wise and grave philosophers have met them on the very carpets of  their libraries For my part I meet them here and there and every where and whereever I meet them whether on high road or on bye road on mountain on valley or on plain I make the most of them Wherever I travel or in whatever manner I travel whether I travel in a carriage on horseback or on foot I never abuse them  Thank Heaven there is a complacency in my disposition which bids defiance to trifling casualties and whether the road be  rough  or whether the road be  smooth  my temper is still the same and I never quarrel with the road nor with myself nor with any thing I meet but go whistling onI only wish I may never meet these rough spots on Mount Aetna on Mount Vesuvius or on any other  burning  mountI care not how  warm  the climate isbut Heaven preserve me from  volcanos  I have an implacable aversion to  fire    A road may be considered as an emblem of life and much instruction may be picked up in very few miles travelling yet some there are and men of great name who have travelled  to Egypt and have attained nothing but the height of the Pyramids or a sketch of the Sphynx though they have written whole volumes upon what they  have seen  and have not  seen  while others have been able to discover a thousand objects in a space not longer than from London to Highgate upon which they have exercised all the benignity of philanthrophy  A road I say may be considered as an emblem of lifeHow various the prospect on the right and on the leftSometimes a serene sometimes a cloudy skyHow different are the passengers in their size in their complexion and in the manner of pursuing their journeyWhat innumerable stops from turnpikesWhat a number of cross roads How many arrests from accidentsAnd how few make for the same restingplace or pursue one certain constant gait  This now is philosophizingthat is if to philosophize be as has been defined by some philosophers according to Montaigne to write at random and play the fool as the essayist  did and which I shall never blush at doing let my subject be what it may providing only that when I do write at random or play the fool my writing and my folly may be marked with some of his features  THE CONFUSION  THE sun had now risen considerably above the horizonthe kine had returned to their pastures having paid their milky tribute to the dairyand the honest hind whose labour enables the luxuriant and the lazy to indulge in pleasures in sensuality and sloth while he experienced the effects of the first judgment announced by the divine wisdom against our primitive parents by earning his bread with the sweat of his brow softened its rigour with a chearful song expressive of content  Every object looked sprightlyevery object appeared gayevery object wore the juvenile dress of summerevery object animate and inanimate contributed a share of chearfulness to the scene  The situation in which the lady had discovered herself on waking had overwhelmed her with confusion A blush of the deepest dye far beyond the boasted Tyrian diffused its colour through her veins sometimes descending it spread over her fair bosom and then as if exhaled by the fire of her bright eyes rose to her face and revelled in a rubid glow  The deep colour did not continue long it faded by degrees to a rosy tint but not to a fixed complexionit sported during the course of our journey in delicate shades It was not difficult to discover what the lady felt it was evident from the revulsion of her blood that the soul laboured and the body languished  If my confusion was not equal to the lady's nor lasting as the confusion which distressed her I felt an equal share of irritation It was my ardent wish to relieve her if possible though I stood in need of relief myself I would have roused my spirits but they had been so lately dispersed it was impossible  to recruit them suddenlyI did all I could to rally them but in vain I looked to the lady for assistancethe lady looked from me as demanding assistance for herself our nerves thrilled in unisonthe vibration was sympatheticthe tremor was reciprocalso had been the cause  I looked again towards the lady taking her at the same instant by the handthe vital spirits began to revive from the lethargy they had lately sunk intothe lady's hand lay in mine a gentle mutual compressure gave my spirits the first alarm  As I looked towards the lady she turned her head round towards me just so much as to give the profile of her face A gentle sigh with a soliciting cast of the eye informed me she expected relief at my hands My heart felt the full force and propriety of the expectationit almost amounted to reproach But how should I relieve her My ideas were astray my tongue was tied and could as well have answered calmly from the rack to the interrogatories of a persecuting Spanish inquisitor  as commence a conversation with my fair companion  Neither of us could articulate a word yet though silent we conversedfor the lady by degrees looking full in my face our eyes spoke and we perfectly understood each other it was the language of  nature  whose declarations were sincere  her  thoughts are undisguised and scorn the deformities of duplicity  You should speak to me said the lady from  charity    Something for the sake of  charity  said a young seaman who had lost an arm and a leg privateering something for charity said the seaman as the coachman pulled up to the door of a small public house to take a dram  It is very common for stagecoachmen and postboys to stop for the purpose of drinking  drams  both in England and Ireland  TWISS's  Travels  and receive some parcels  A moment before I would most willingly have purchased this interruption at any expence  being now relieved from embarrassment by the lady's having opened the conversation I wished the seaman had lost his head instead of his armjust as my peevish temper suggested the inhuman thought the poor fellow addressing himself to the lady and turning from me said Madam I have lost my arm in the service of my country and he held up his stump  This man who had faced the horrors of war undaunted this man who had faced death in a thousand different shapes undismayed was scared by the inhospitable the ungracious and forbidding look vexation had thrown into my countenance  I was preparing to recompense the injury I intended him by my wish which was now retorted with full force upon myself by giving him the silver I had put into the purse I had prepared for the highwaymanbut as I drew the purse from my pocket AVARICE whispered in my ear he has  Greenwich  to support him or if not he has his parish to maintain him  Burrow  's Settlement Cases  lay upon the seat opposite to me close to  Lord Coke  The  law  has made a provision for him said  Sir James Burrow  CHARITY whispered in the opposite ear to that which AVARICE had applied her mouth tothis was the  further  ear from the poor sailorbut her words sunk deep into my soul  It is certainly an  honour  to the  law  whispered  Charity  that it makes a provision for the poor but it is no great honour to  human nature  that the law has  need  to make such provision  The  intention  of the  law  is good said  Sir James Burrow  but the hundreds of decisions upon  Charity  cases which I have collected have swallowed up more of the  provision  allotted the poor than even the  overseers  have swallowed upthe poor are starved between the expenditures of  litigation  and  gormandizing  It was the opinion of the Court of King's Bench upon an application to  increase  the overseers of the poor in a certain parish that the  distresses  of the poor bore a  proportion  to the number of  overseers  appointed to take care of themJ BURROW  Like the  Arigentines  they eat and drink as if every day was to be their last  MONTAIGNE    I had the purse half up when VANITY stepping in with her advice and aiding the solicitations of CHARITY induced me to draw it to the very edge of my pocket A few acts of generosity

the seaman's stump the prebendary gently spurred his horse and rode on  Your  honours  will remember me said the  seaman  addressing himself to the prebendary's  servants  The prebendary's servants

the guards with his knapsack flung at his shoulders holding a child by the one hand and his wife following carrying another child succeeded  Brother soldier can you spare a trifle to a poor seaman said the mutilated tar  Dn your eyes  answered the serjeant here's all I can spare and he threw sixpence into the seaman's hatThe wife followed the example of her husbandshe dropped her  mite  and passed on O may that  mite  be layed up in Heaven and may the scanty pittance in the corner of your husband's knapsack increase like the widow's cruse  The serjeant's curse cut me to the heart I

involuntarily springing from the noble motive of compassion which the example set me by the serjeant had instantaneously kindled in my breast  The lady also felt the force of the serjeant's  damn  and contributed under its impulse to the seaman's wants  I insert this  damn  of the serjeant as a precept for the edification of a certain bench and all those who derive authority under them but they

Miller    No man will say that the church is too amply provided for  Bishop of PETERBGH  in debate  ▪    THE PROPOSAL  THE human mind should ever be employed mental exercise and industry being as essential to the health of the  soul  as corporeal exercise and labour is to the health of the body Idleness in the mind produces  vice  idleness in the body produces disease The vacant hours of dulness are the most dangerous hours of life for when ever the  tempter  of mankind who is always on the watch finds the mind out of employment he never fails to step in with one or other vicious incitement to seduce the soul from virtue  For this reason I have established as a rule in the mental code by which I govern myself that when ever I find my mind inadequate to the exercises of study or rational contemplation which is too often the case to seek immediate employment for my ideas in some innocent amusement  It is certainly the most probable way of avoiding the  devil  and all his  works  I never  stood  in greater necessity for the application of my  rule  than at the present instantWas my life to pay the forfeit I could not enter into a serious conversation with the lady or a proper conversation with myself so finding it impossible to  speak  and dreading the  consequence  of  thinking  I resolved to disappoint  Old Nick  by proposing an  amusement  I asked the lady to play  travelling piquet  TRAVELLING PICQUET  THE lady declared she was totally ignorant of the game  I once played the game said I when Fortune being in a goodnatured mood as she was this day introduced me to a  tete à tete  party with a young widow whom I met at  Holyhead  and travelled with in a post coach to  Chester    Then said the lady you are but a  novice  at the  game  yourself  No Madam answered I the young widow was  experienced  in it and by her instructions and playing it repeatedly since I am now a perfect  adept  at the  game  and if you give permission will instruct you  The lady bowing smiled assent to play and I commenced my lesson  THE LESSON  SUPPOSE Madam said I addressing myself to the lady suppose Madam you and Ior suppose Madam you and any other companion were travelling in a coach postchaise or  vis à vis  A  vis à vis  exclaimed the lady to ride in a  vis à vis  is the height of my ambition  A  vis à vis  Madam said I is the most convenient carriage for playing  travelling picquet  in twenty to oneI proceeded in my instructions  Suppose Madam you and I travel together in a carriageWe  are  travelling together observed the ladyWell Madam you and I travelling together in a carriage I reckon two for every gate  I  see on the  right  hand side of the road you reckon two for every gate  you  see on the  left  hand side of the road and  so according to agreement a certain number is reckoned for every object seen by  you  on your side of the road or seen by me on my side of the road whether man or woman horse or mare bull or cow ram or ewe cock or hen c  You understand me Madam said I  Perfectly answered the lady  But observe MadamA man and woman a horse and marea bull and cowa ram and ewea cock and hen  Et caetera  said the lady interrupting my recapitulationI went onA man and woman  caetera  Madam may chance to present themselves on your side of the road or on my side of the road so as to entitle you Madam or to entitle me Madam to a  repique  You must explain that said the lady  Remember Madam said II don't say man  or  woman horse  or  mare cbut man  and  woman horse  and  mare c  Your reason Sir for the distinction said the lady  Doctor  Lowth  Madam now bishop of London and all learned Grammarians inform us that  or  is a conjunction disjunctive  I have been taught so myself said the lady  The same learned bishop Madam and other learned authoritiesyou don't except to the bishop for being a  living  authority  It has been a  rule of court  not to receive  living  authorities in the King'sbench neither  Sir Wm Blackstone  's inimitable commentaries nor MY  reports  have been attended toC LFT  This is rather extraordinary when we consider what little reverence has been paid to  precedents  which are now termed the  dead

lady hummed a tune  You now understand the game Madam The lady hummed on  If you don't understand it Madam the fault is not with you nor with me nor with the bishop of London nor with the other  learned grammarians and I swear by  Moses  ' rod which rod was greater than all the rods of all the Egyptian Magi or by the scepter with which the great Mogul  attempts  to rule the beauties in his seraglio the fault should not be imputed to  nature  she has given us understanding sufficient to understand all  things  that should be understood  And pray where does the fault lie Sir said the lady  We will find out the place presently Madam  THE GAME  THE lady had reckoned on several gates  So had I  The lady had reckoned on several passengers male and female  So had I  The lady had reckoned on horses kine sheep goats dogs cats and poultry of various kinds  So had I  The lady had reckoned on waggons carts coaches chaises whiskeys and caprioles  So had I  The lady had reckoned on  one gigg    So had I  The lady had reckoned up to fifty I had only reckoned up to thirty The eagerness of expecting conquest sparkled in her eye and marked every feature of her face when a young woman who desired to be taken up as an outside passenger stopped the coach  THE REPIQUE  THE prospect on my side being beautiful naturally drew the lady's eyes that way to view it We were admiring the landscape when a country lad and lass who appeared fatigued with the labour of the morning for the lass walked leaning upon the lad's arm having arrived at the shady side of a hillock sat down  I reckoned four to my game  The lad gave the lass a  kiss  by the rule of the game I was entitled to reckon two more  He kissed her againagainand again I foresaw the game would be my own  Encore  said I  Devil take the impudent fellow said the lady peevishly at the same time suppressing a half smile I shall certainly loseBut the  lass  Madam said I appears as much my friend as the  lad    She is a Methodist perhaps answered the lady and has been instructed in the doctrine of  non resistance    And he is probably of the  same  profession replied I for if I am not mistaken there will be a  love feast  presentlyThe lad gave the lass another kiss to illustrate my suppositionI reckoned  two more  The lady bit her under lip  That  Madam said I is a  point  The lady hummed and looked down  And ***** that Madam continued I pointing with my forefinger thus ☞is a  quint  The lady looked uplooked forward then looked up again as if to look for something in the  sky  and overlook every thing on the  ground  she then looked down and played with her  apron string    The lass on the hillock side was also looking at the  sky    You will certainly lose MadamI believe I shall lose said the lady tying and untying her apron string  There is no doubt now Madamsee see  pointquinte  and  quatorze  A  repique  by the feathered arrow of Cupid and by his favourite  quiver  The lady took a serious look at the lad and lass to be convinced of her loss and being convinced turning her head aside tacitly acknowledged I had won  The young country woman who stopped the coach had by this time agreed with the coachmanhad ascended the box and adjusted herself in her seat  You may now  drive on  said the young country woman to the coachman  So  we drove on    And may every man I esteem on earth drive thro' the journey of this life with as much pleasure content and innocence of heart as I  drove  on to  Windsor    I had no reason however to triumph in my victoryfor tho' I won the  first  I  lost  the  second  and

an opinion on it is probable our author introduced his  introduction  in this place in hopes the reviewers would not read so farNext month will shew whether the reviewers have reached his  introduction  indeed the probability is that they will not peep farther than into the title page  ANONYMOUS    IN which introduction if there should appear any malice envy detraction revenge indecency c the courteous reader will recollect that this same introduction was written at the  instigation of the Devil  at a time when I had not the fear of heaven before my eyes  It will be said I have imitated STERNE I have heard of an author who wrote a play in imitation of Shakespear the play was a good play enough and had one line strongly  imitative of  Shakespear  's manner which line was "good morrow good master lieutenant" It will be said I imitate STERNEIt is true like STERNE my pen guides me I don't guide my pen I write my thoughts liberally unstudied and unarranged as they spontaneously arise to my imagination without cultivation or pruningof consequence they will be deficient in  ornament  in  profit  and in  strength  but if they are  natural  I am satisfied  I have always read STERNE with delight and never read him but I felt him in my heart more than in my head yet I hope his precepts have improved my understanding in the same proportion they have expanded my humanity His precepts affect me like  wine  they make my heart gladthey affect me like  love  or rather they affect me like a  conjunction  of  love and wine  for they make me generous and gay Imbibing his opinions has sweetened whatever portion of acidity Nature Misfortune and Disappointment have mixed in my composition and having grafted them upon my heart it is probable their emanations  may produce some pleasing blossoms some good fruitGood fruit may be produced by ingrafting upon a  crab    This is a palpable plagiary from  my  DUENNA  The author of the DUENNA whoever he is    If I should exhibit any feature bearing likeness to STERNE I shall be proud of the similarity but for this happiness I can scarcely hope The stile of STERNE is peculiar to himself his art is to please the imagination and improve the mind with natural yet elegant simplicity He is master of that charming enthusiasm inspired by heaven itself for the instruction of its creatures and in his composition there is a certain incommunicable art of making one part rise gracefully out of another which is felt by all though seen only by the critic  See a Student's letter to John Dunning  Esq  in defence of the Rev H Bate Printed by Bladon Paternosterrow  His life his opinions his sermons his journey his letters and every thing he has written will be read with admiration  will be read with pleasure and

circulation among pastrycooks snuffretailers fireworkers chandlers cheesemongers and their customers  ANONYMOUS  The works of STERNE will be in the hands in the heads and in the hearts of every man ay and every woman too of feeling when the works of the  Smellfungusses  and the  Mundungusses  of the age will be lining trunks and band boxes  I have  cut up  several of the best  modern authors  at my shop the corner of St Paul's churchyard as any person may see who will take the trouble of looking into my trunks  DEPUTY CLEMENTS    The imatators of STERNE it must be allowed have as much  wit  as they have  judgment  and there are plenty of them heaven  knows  This is clearly  irony  I profess myself an imitator of STERNE and the following critique which I did  not  send to the MORNING HERALD nor  pay  for will shew whether I have been successful in my imitation or notPETER M'DERMOTT  THE CRITIQUE  If STERNE was ever  rivalled  in the descriptive the narrative in language or in the sentimental it is by  Mr M'Dermott  in his new publication of the FEMALE MONITOR the history of  Arabella  is one of the most masterly drawings of the  human penLocke Hume  and many other celebrated authors have favoured us with essays on education but  in  Arabella  they live  and theory rendered practicable by sweet and easy admonition the strictures of the Female Monitor with the author's own digressions are admirably interwoven in the piece and  forms  a most instructive and agreeable dialogue the letters from Mr Worthy to his son Charles at Oxford are  sterling  and  abounds  with honourable precepts and information the description of the old halfpay officer given by Charles is one of those most affecting a  sentimental situation  that demands the  tear of admiration  and plucks the  laurel  from the  Monk of Calis  Lady Gay's  career  through life is  dramatically conceived  and gives  precept  a  risible  cast judiciously introduced to close the scene  The  name  of the author of the FEMALE MONITOR as well as the  modesty  which marks this  critique  clearly points out the country which had the honour of giving him birth a circumstance which in  my  opinion must recommend him to all  mammas  all  mams  of boarding schools and  private governesses  of young ladies particularly as the  critique  declares the work to be the most masterly drawing of the  human pen  which shews that the work like many other works does not carry the  traits  of the  goosequill  indeed it goes a great way to prove the certainty of an old opinion that  Irishmen  have  wings  and out of some of their pinions perhaps Mr M'Dermott's  human pen  was plucked But I find it impossible to  conceive  though I have called in my husband's aid to my assistance the following assertion"  Locke Hume  and  many other  celebrated authors have favoured us with essays on education but  in  ARABELLA  they  live" now as  Locke  and  Hume  are indubitably  dead  and we have not heard of their  resurrection  how comes it that  they  live in  Arabella  indeed were they  alive  it is out of nature to suppose they should  live  so long  in Arabella  for though  Jonas  lived a considerable time in the  whale's belly  his life was preserved by miracle and he was but  one  person whereas it appears that  Arabella  is  ensient  that is big with  Locke Hume  and several  other  authors It is true a certain dutchess of  Heidleberg  had three hundred and sixtyfive  children  at a birth and the font in which they were christened is still shewn in the great church of the town but then these were children not men But perhaps the critique upon Mr M'Dermott's work does not mean that the  philosophers  and authors are  in  poor  Arabella  in a state of  transubstantiation  but only in  Spirit  which the author of the  Female Monitor  might believe if he admits the doctrine of  Metempsychosis  or transmigration of  souls  for though a woman could not rightly entertain so many  men  in  ventra semere  corporally yet she might entertain them  spiritually  as may be proved from the number of  devils  sometimes a whole  legion  together which have  possessed  persons in former timesCATHARINE MAC GRAM  The FEMALE MONITOR certainly demands the  tear  of  admiration  whenever admiration  weeps  but I cannot think there was much sentiment in the author's plucking the  laurel  from the  Monk of Calais  by which I suppose he must mean "  the few scattered white hairs upon his temples  "  COURTNEY MELMOUTH  Whether I have wit or judgment must be left to my readers and among  these I hope I shall be honoured with the judgment of the reviewers  REVIEWERS  It was my opinion when I wrote in favour of the Irish nation that there should be at least one BANKER  hanged  once within every year it is now my opinion that there should be at least  one  REVIEWER  hanged  within every month These fellows I speak of the  Reviewers  look only for the  excrementitious  parts of a work and indeed it must be allowed that no  town hag  hath a better nose at smelling out  ordure  they remind me of a bird of passage of the aquatic tribe which annually visiteth a little island on the Irish coast near the harbour of Dublin this bird is called by the vulgar a  Magsh  and liveth by pursuing  gulls  and pecking them with his bill which though  blunt  is  offensive  and  provoking  till the poor  gull  droppeth his  dung  which the  Magsh  swalloweth up for  food    JONATHAN SWIFT  I have mentioned your title Gentlemen and cannot pass you by unnoticed  tho' like  Yahoes  I expect you will mount among the branches of my  laurel  If the reviewers are not entitled to the laurel yet surely as they are the extracters of the  essence  of every work they are deserving of the  laurel water  KNRK Jun  and bemute my fair production What say the critical sons of sapience  Several persons having been surprized that strong marks of  lunacy  should appear in the  criticisms  of the  reviewers  Doctor HUNTER a very able anatomist took their  brains  into physical consideration for brains most of them have notwithstanding what some people have advanced to the contrary and having first discovered that their productions were  lunar  he next found that from the nature of their office being forced to write  in the full of the moon  it fully accounts for their  periodical insanity  ANONYMOUS  They lift up their voices and cry as one man these  sentimental excursions  are a servile imitation in thought in word and in deed Suppose they are imitations they are imitations of a great master who had his  jerkin  as he says himself  cut  and  slashed  by these  reviewers  to very  shreds  and well might he say  cut  and  slashed  for be it known to all whom it may  concern in the REPUBLIC OF LETTERS that these  kings of shreds and patches  the  reviewers  do literally  cut  and  slash  they having almost given up the use of  pen  and  ink  in  composing  their works and substituted  scissars  and  paste  The PEOPLE of the LITERARY WORLD that is the PEOPLE OF PATERNOSTERROW can vouch the truth of this assertion not only as it relates to the  reviewers  but to the various tribes of modern  mathematicians politicians biographists historians essayists voyagers  ay and divines too who all  cut  and  pastepaste  and  cut  It is the author who can  cut  and  paste  well and not the author who can  conceive  and  write  well who makes money for the former will  cut  down and  paste  up half a dozen volumes before the latter can invent and arrange a single page Yet these form the modern LITERATI  MODERN LITERATI I will give you their character We find among them enemies to princes yet flatterers of minions and sycophants Moralists in theory yet sensualists in practice Sceptics in doctrine dogmatists in judgment who while they profess disinterestedness and independence introduce their venal muses to voluntary prostitution  SAM JOHNSON    Now IMITATION is quite a different thing from  scissars  and  paste  Your  scissars  and  paste  gentry are the common defamers of the town every man of genius disclaims them I consider them as literary vagrants and were I on earth I would whenever I caught them scribbling take upon me the office of beadle and scourge them into an  honest  way of earning their bread  CH CHURCHILL  Every man who possesses a nice and critical eye must see that notwithstanding the present flourishing state of the elegant arts little more than  imitation  can be attributed to the artists of the day in any department From  Homer  down to the lowest of the lowest poets all are imitators but the  modern majority  are  pilferers  Query if this assertion is not a  libel  upon the House of Commons by  Innuendo  many of them open literary robbers  Vide Lord Carlisle's poems Mr Eden's letters c c  wretched scribblers who by inserting among their laborious  nothings  whole paragraphs  from books of genius stock the shops with heterogenous monsters Now  literary  pilferers and robbers are not to be classed with  imitators  for  imitators  may possess what these dull rogues never can possessthey may possess  genius  and  invention  The works of STERNE have at least a stronger claim to  originality  than any other modern production and yet even STERNE has his  imitations  he can laugh out in the tone of  Rabellais  and skip from his subject or smile with the chearfulness of  Montaigne  or he can assume the sober sensations of delight of heartfelt complacency and seer with the pointed grave  Cervantes  Now if I imitate STERNE have I not as just a right to imitate him as he had to imitate  Rabellais Montaigne  and  Cervantes  or as  Virgil  had to imitate  Homer  We apples swim  AESOP'S FABLES  The  right  I have but where is the ability STERNE could throw every thing into a new light but who can threw a new light upon STERNE  As to the thoughts which may appear in my WORKS say what you will gentlemen  reviewers  my thoughts are  my own  wherever I collect them Whether they are  ferae natura  caught by me flying in the atmosphere of fancyor sporting in the fields of imaginationor whether they are rendered tame and profitable by the industry of another's study whether they vegetate in my own brain or are transplanted there ready cultivated from the brain of another person my thoughts are my own wherever I get them for I cannot part with them when once I get possession of themThey become annexed to the soil I have a  common law  right to them  Here our author shews a total ignorance of  common law  for no right in  ideas  exists by  common law  it has been proved to be but an  ideal  right But though a man has no  legal  right in his own ideas yet he has a right to possess himself of every  other  man's ideas as may be fully seen by looking into my  Miltonic  poem of the  Universe  which was in a great measure dictated by my EUDOSIA who sucked in her erudition from the great FERGUSON now alas defunctBut to the  Law  A majority of the twelve judges assembled in the Exchequerchamber determined upon solemn debate that no man can have a

Shakespear  was a thiefI do not mean in deer stealing but  Shakespear  stole from nature  Pope  was a thief  Pope  stole propriety of thought delicacy of sentiment justness of methodand elegance of composition  But this is an honest age we have no such  thieves  in these days if we had they could not live the reviewers are such excellent  thieftakers  The SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL like Peachum's  lock

steal such another  The  Man of the World  is a drama without an  original  thought every sentiment it contains is to be met with in the conversation of the times the manners exhibited are as familiar as the manners of common life and the incidents are merely such as happen every day Nay the characters are nothing better than copies from  Nature  As to the general plan of the piece its unities its fable and its moral are so strongly similar to the foundation upon which the drama of the  antients  has been built that the plagiary is evident  These were the reasons which induced me so long to refuse licensing the piece besides it satirises reigning vices and a man should be very cautious how he exclaims against reigning vices or fashionable habits in a polite circle lest somebody present should apply the satire to himself  HRD    This comedy wants  novelty  it being acted every hour in every great house in every great square and every great street in this great metropolis and therefore as human nature is invariable the merit of the author of the MAN OF THE WORLD consists in nothing more than exhibiting in dramatic form and dialogue the customs and habits which have unavoidably taken place and characterize the history of the day  Having touched a little upon  imitation  and literary thieving I will now state a few unarranged thoughts on  similarity  of thinking  The  variety  we see in the persons in the faces and in the modes of thinking which distinguish the individuals who compose the human animal are astonishing But  variety  and  contrast  in the appearance and manners of man are necessary to the purposes of his being and shew the infinite wisdom and infinite power of his Creator  From variety and contrast of person we judge of proportion and the elegance of symmetry  From variety and contrast of face we judge of beauty and of ornament  And from variety and contrast of thinking we judge of intellectual capacity as it operates in the progress of its study upon sciences and its invention and improvement in the arts  So that it may be said that the knowledge of all arts and the knowledge of all sciences which include the knowledge of all things is the consequence of variety in our modes of thinking and contrast in our opinions which variety and contrast stimulate us to controversy and experiment And as  virtue  would not have been known but for the contrast of  vice  nor  colours  but for the  variety  of their  shades  neither would arts nor sciences have been known had the organs of mankind been so formed that  every  individual should think alike  Yet notwithstanding the versatile sportings of nature in forming her creatures we often find a strong similitude of person a strong similitude of face and a strong similitude in  the mode of acting and of thinking between persons totally unalliedtotally unacquainted with each other and perhaps there never were such strong instances of SIMILARITY IN THINKING as have arisen within these few years  I shall pursue one line of illustration to support this assertion and that line shall be the line of the  drama  Mr SHERIDAN has been so happy as to think like  Congreve  to think like  Buckingham  to think like  Farquhar  to think like  Wycherly  and RUMOUR says that Mr  Sheridan  has been so happy as to think like many living authors  A most unhappy accident happened at the moving a certain manager's goods from his  old  house in  Great Queenstreet  to his  new  house in  GrovesnorPlace  A large trunk containing some hundreds of manuscript pieces was  stolen  out of the  cart  which was transporting them and the wretched  authors  have not been able as yet to  hear  any thing about them but it is the general opinion that in the course of the next season if they attend the theatre on the performance of  new  pieces they may have the satisfaction of receiving  auricular  intelligence that their  thoughts  are not  totally lost  to the  world  A certain  Amanuensis  is supposed to be the  robber    PUBLIC LEDGER  Yet it is certain that on the  merit  of  new pieces  unhappily living authors do not think like Mr  Sheridan  Some  critics  say that Mr  Sheridan  in his late prologue to Lady  Craven  's  piece  I did not intend  my piece  for  public  exhibition but for the entertainment of a few  private  friends  CPN  thought like Mr  Colman  in his late prelude  Mr COLMAN in this same prelude has thought like Mr  Foote  and in many of his other writings it is said Mr  Colman  has been so lucky as to think not only like those authors who have reached  Parnassus  but like other authors who have attempted to gain the mount through the  medium  of Mr  Colman  's theatre  Mr SHERIDAN and Mr COLMAN being both  managers  and authors may not only think  like other  authors but may think  for  other authors and crush their  merit  with impunity  Mr CUMBERLAND in his  West Indian  has thought exactly like Mr  Macklin  in his  Love  à la Mode  In the  Widow of Delphi  Mr  Cumberland  has thought like himself  SHAKESPEARE is certainly wrong in writing  Delphos  the classical term is  Delphi  but perhaps  Shakespeare  meant  Delos  a  Grecian  island  R CUMBERLAND  From the above note it is clear that had  Shakespeare  possessed  Cumberland  's LEARNING or had  Cumberland  possessed  Shakespeare  's GENIUS they would have been upon an equality That is  Cumberland  would have been as GREAT as  Shakespeare  and so  vice versa  Shakespeare would have been as GREAT as Cumberland and England would have had the honour of producing the  two  greatest of all authors  ANONYMOUS    Mr MACKLIN has never been charged with  thinking  like any other author  It has been my misfortune to be too communicative of my  thoughts  by which I have often been anticipated by those I considered as  confidential  friends  C MACKLIN    Mr DIBDIN it is true has thought but how  he  has thought is not worth thinking about and the same may be said of several others  Mr MURPHY never troubles his head with  thinking  he translates  Mrs COWLEY has attacked Miss  Moore  for  thinking  like her and a  Templer  asserts  that Mrs  Cowley  in her  Belle  's  Stratagem  has  thought  exactly as  hethought  in a comedy and an opera both rejected by Mr  Harris  CAPTAIN JEPHSON in his  tragedies  though he has  thought  like  many  people yet he has also thought much upon the  similarity  of  things  His  Law of Lombardy  is a  tragedy  of the  massacre  of similies he has told us in it what every thing is  like  but he has not told us what any  one  thing is  Mr ANDREWS in his  Dissipation  has very fortunately  thought  like a gentlemen who some time since wrote an entertainment on Lord  Darbey  's  Fete Champetre  The AUTHOR of the  Lord of the Manor  has  thought  exactly as General  Burgoyne  thought in the House of CommonsBut of all the authors or authoresses who have lately thought like their contemporaries no author or authoress stands so distinguished as Miss LEE and of all the  accidents  in the  Chapter of Accidents  the happiest accidents are these where Miss Lee thinks like another author  wherever that happens Miss  Lee  certainly thinks well  But surely it is now full time I should  think  of continuing my excursions in the pursuit of which heaven send that I may  think  like STERNE  WINDSOR THE INN  HAVING arrived at WINDSOR and handed the lady out of the coach into the inn we were shewed into a parlour by the landlord in his proper person Here a very serious difficulty started which never occurred at least to me during the whole course of the journeyHow am I to part with my fellowtraveller thought IAy "there is the rub" and a severe rub it was I was totally ignorant of the lady's name the lady was totally ignorant of my name It is true I knew  something  about her but a motive in which curiosity had the smallest share made me wish most ardently to know  every thing  about herNo sooner had I perceived  this inclination for gaining an  intimate knowledge  of the  lady  and the  lady  's  affairs  than I flattered myself that the lady felt as ardent an inclination to be intimately acquainted with  me  with  every thing  about me and with  my affairs  I not only wished to know her but to know all her connectionsI asked myself a thousand questions about her without putting one question to her  Who is she  Whence came she  Who is her father  Who is her mother  Who are her brothers  Who are her sisters  Has she any brothers and sisters uncles aunts or cousins  These questions I put deliberately to myself stringing them together in succession as the facetious  Sancho Panza  the laughandbefatsubhero of  Don Quixote  's adventures strung his proverbs But no sooner had I finished my interrogatories upon her relations  than a multitude of other interrogatories rushed in upon my mind impetuously  Is she a maid  Find that out  would have been the proper answer  Is she a wife  Is she a widow  Is she neither maid wife nor widow  Is she a mistress  Is she rich  That is no business of mine  Is she poor  Not in  spirit  for to me she has been most liberal and if she wants assistance to replenish her purse or to right her wrongs by Heaven my purse I was master of fortyeight guineas which was within two guineas of my quarter's allowance and my sword which though of old mourningmounting had an excellent blade of genuine Toledo temper are both at her service  LOVE  WE stood in a parlour of the inn our hands locked within each otherIt would be hard Madam said I sighing after the pleasant journey we have experienced to part as ignorant of each other as we met It shall not be my fault said the lady if we are not longer acquainted I am come to spend a few weeks at Windsor and if you wish to continue an intimacy which  accident  produced and added I interrupting her which  love  assistedLove alas said the lady shaking her head there was no  love  in the case our meeting and every thing that has happened since we met were the effects of  accident  assisted by  nature  then Madam said I bowing and laying my hand upon my heartand what is  love  but  nature  Thelady blushed but silently assented to my opinion which she illustrated by a sentimental gentle squeeze of the hand I thanked her for the compliment by returning the squeeze in the same sentimental gentle manner I had received it and raising her hand to my lips "she nothing loath" kissed it with the genuine fervour of affection and sincerity The lady recovered her spirits and the whole force of those spirits starting into her eyes her bosom heaving with a hearteasing sigh alas said she with an amiable frankness I must acknowledge the propriety of your observationLOVE IS THE CHILD OF NATURE But I must sincerely regret that mere  accident  has convinced me of this truth How happy should I have been if a long acquaintance matured into friendship and a series of reciprocal obligations had been the means of my convictionhow happy should I have been if it had been my fortune to have  loved  from the result of  judgment  not from the effect of  contingency  and she wept  Now the lady's tears were  natural  but it was unnatural to suppose that  love  could result from  judgment  I acknowledge continued the lady wiping her eyes I acknowledge we are sometimes excuseable for yielding to the simple authority of  nature  but what have I done I have suffered myself to be hurried away to be transported by her tyrannical dictates whereas reason alone should have authority over the conduct of our inclinationsShe wept againI felt the full force of her tears they were a dew which nourished my infant passion  Falling upon one knee with faultering speech I swore never to part from her Her countenance brightened on hearing my vowshe appeared happyher looks touched my very soul our happiness was mutualand surely the pleasure which the benevolent mind feels in the happiness of others is one of the most delightful sensations with which the human soul is blest  A QUESTION ANSWERED  QUESTIONWhat is LOVE  ANSWERLove is a desire of contracting friendship of uniting with and communicating happiness to a beautiful object every eye making its own beautyLove is active eager sharp precipitateLove is fickle moving and inconstant love is a fever subject to intermissions and paroxysms But give me that love which when the paroxysms have subsided retains an universal fire  Those who intend to try my  celestial  beds may be assured that the consequence will be that after experiencing the paroxysms of pleasure they will also experience an  universal fire  electrifying their whole frame as an emblem of which I have placed  Mercury  over my temple  GRAHAM D M  but temperate and equal a constant established heat all easy and smooth without poignancy or roughness  Yet love is a tyrantAll passions are tyrants but love is the greatest tyrant of all the passions for love holds all the other passions under arbitrary subjectionlove leads every man by the  nose  The word NOSE as it  stands  here should not have been  italicked  but should have been written in the old ROMAN or old IRISH characters I have been in ROME and in DUBLIN and understand the  Italian  and IRISH men manners and tongues and I am clear that no man whose NOSE is of the  Italian cut  ever permitted love to  lead  him by the NOSE HENRIETTA H  TTN  love makes the  miser  soften the rigour of his  avarice  It never could soften the rigour of mine ROBMNNSnor of mine  THO

I never experience that love where the flame rises to a frantic passion to enjoy an object who flies me Save me from  coquets  good heaven curse me not with  jilts  and bless me with the possession of that true love which looks to  me  alone for happiness that true love which being founded on sincerity is a stranger to arts and gallantry that true love which flourishes only amongst its own natural sweets complacency mutual esteem and constancy  Constancy Welland I have been  constant  though set down as a woman of  gallantry  I defy my enemies to say except the Jew who not being a  Christian  is not to be  believed  that I have ever shewn inconstancy to  one  lover till I have met  another lover  whom I liked betterM ROBNN  Upon my  honour  this is  truth  and I could prove it by  virtue  of  royal authority    T RBN  give me a woman  whose  mind  is without  stain  whose  manners  are without  art  and whose person is free from every  embellishment  but those embellishments it has acquired from the hand of  nature  Such a woman have I met  HMILN    THE DEPARTURE  I Must leave you said the lady drawing away her hand from mine but drawing it away reluctantlymy hand pressing her hand tenderlyI must leave you said she or my friends who are now impatiently expecting me will be surprized at my delay and knowing this to be the usual hour for the stage's arrival will come to seek meso permitting me to take the liberty of a kiss and promising I should hear from her in the course of the evening she departed from the inn I led her to the outward doorshe insisted I should go no fartherand not knowing but she had private reasons for refusing an  escorte  I permitted her to depart unattended my eyes following her down the street till coming to a corner she nodded a farewel and disappeared  A REFLECTION  I Directly returned to the innand going into the parlour looked out of the window towards the royal palacethis is WINDSOR said I to myself Windsor so renowned in ancient story Windsor so celebrated in ancient song  And here our Edward's and our Henry's have resided have sported in the chace and exercised at the tournament  This is Windsor rendered immortal by immortal Pope and now the residence of the most numerous progeny that ever royalty producedPriam it is true had sixty sons but how many  wives  had Priam  The prospect I was informed from the castleterrace was truly beautiful but the town is cursed straggling and cursed inconvenientI took out my watch to see the  hourmercy preserve me exclaimed I it is but a few hours since I left London and what a number of incidents have marked that short space of timeEvery circumstance rushed upon my memoryI found myself uneasysomething was wantingI sighed and my sighing told me it was my fair companion but she was gone  THE OVERSIGHT  WAS there ever such an oversight was there ever such a fool as I have been to let her depart without enquiring her nameperhaps I may never seeperhaps I may never hear of her moreprudence on reflection may induce her to conceal herself  I rung for my servant asked him the lady's name but to enquire the lady's name had never entered into his head no more than it had entered into mineI eased my chagrin by severely reproving his negligence though my uneasiness was the result of my own stupidity  My servant had spirit and I had always indulged him in a free exercise of ithe retaliated my reproof by telling me he had no orders to enquire after the name of the lady  but said he with an arch significant smile I know the name of the country girl who rode with me upon the outside of the coach I felt the sarcasm I saw the fellow triumph and could have knocked him down  Raging with vexation and disappointment I had the coachman calledthe coachman knew nothing about herI had the waiters called the waiters knew nothing about herI almost stormed and snatching up my hat was proceeding to sally out upon an expedition of reconoitering and enquiry when my servant gave a half smack with his mouth and informed me I had not ordered any thing for dinner  I left him to indulge his own palate in the orders but meeting the landlord in the entry he presented a long bill of fareyou may have Sir said the landlord and he run thro' his bill of fare throwing his eyes up for my command as he repeated each articleyou may have venison fowls ducks roast leg of lamb pigeonpie mackarel c cDo you take me said I for an overseer of the  poor or the bencher of an inn of court Let me have a beefsteakand I passed by the landlord  Getting into the street I was as much at a loss as ever to find out the lady so enquiring my way to the castle I soon found myself upon the terrace  THE TERRACE  LOOKING round me as I stood upon the terrace I was astonished at the beauty of the prospect The air was serene the landscape inchanting the sky clear except a few clouds towards the horizon which set off the brilliancy of its azure as moles do the fairness of the human skinSome villas lay open to the view others were in part concealed and the sun darted his midday beams to gild the various turrets and spires which glistened through the scene  The Thames rolled his silvered flood in silent majesty towards the sea enriching his bordering banks with verdure and the brightest tints and woods and forests some planted by nature time immemorial others raised by the assisting hand of industry waved their graceful pliant branches and shook their leafy  honoursobedient to every gale Between these woods meadows pastures and gardens at different distances opening interminable gave a luxuriant diversity to the whole  Here gurgling brooks gently meandering along their pebbly channels pour their tributary urns into the sovereign riverand there a rich profusion of hillocks tufted with various trees among which groups of animals grazed slept or play'd in peace and happiness though different in their kinds  The whole closed with an extended horizon and charmed the soul with delightful grandeur  Alas said I looking round my soul elevated to enthusiasmit was here our greatest English bards invoked and received the inspiration of their muse  So taking out my pencil I wrote in my pocketbookthe first lines of poetry I ever attempted  REFLECTIONS ON WINDSOR FOREST  HERE GENIUS learn'd to pour th' enlighten'd ray  Here DULNESS shut her leaden eye from day  The youthful poet who'd to same aspire  Here caught from thee my SHAKESPEARE living fire  'Twas here the TRAGIC MUSE aloft did sing  Here ARNE and HANDEL tun'd the dulcet string  Here laughing COMEDY with sprightly tread  The  gaudy  feather tore from FOLLY's head  Expos'd base vice and cry'd vile passions down  Reform'd our manners and improv'd the town  Here poignant SWIFT with barbed arrow stung  Here POPE immortal golden numbers sung  Here stream'd the tears of melancholy YOUNG  Here WALLER pip'd the lover's melting lay  Here gently blaz'd the lambient slame of GAY  Here ADDISON improv'd the

OTWAY ROWE and THOMPSON chose their rhyme  Names which defiance bid to mouldring time  I wrote the above  enchanting  Our author seems to have no bad opinion of himself  ANONYMOUS  description with a pen made of a  goosequill    Heigh hoI asked myself why that involuntary sigh I answered with another heigh ho Alas what is all this without dear woman "heaven's last best gift"  I will describe the excellencies of woman but where shall I get a pen adequate to such a description  The goosequill is not  worthy  the swanquill is too  stiff  and the crowquill though used by ladies is too  black  and too often employed in the poisoning works of  defamation  I will therefore leave the goosequill to  philosophers  the swanquill to  mathematicians  and the crowquill to  lawyers old maids  and  newspaperparagraphgatherers  but for myself I will pluck a quill from THE BIRD OF PARADISE  Well I have plucked my quill and my pen is in order in gratitude then I cannot but say something of the pretty  bird  from whose  tail  I have plucked my  quill  THE BIRD OF PARADISE  It was long thought by naturalists that the  bird of paradise  had been  hatched nested  and  fledged  in  Ireland  and that it was a bird of passage but in a paragraph which appeared some time ago in one of the public prints just before this  little bird  was seen  hopping  in  Coventgarden  Ireland is denied that honour though it is allowed in the said paragraph that the old  cock  and  hen  who produced this  lovely bird  as well as the  young cock  with whom she first  billed  and  flew  away were  Irish    ASHN LVR  Knight    THE subject is  extensive  The subject is so  deep  I know not where to begin and if I do  begin  I fear I shall never reach the  bottom    Shall I begin at the  head  or shall I begin at the  tail  I write on the  bird of paradise  therefore the  tail  must have the preference to the  head  for of all the birds in the air the  bird of paradise  has the most beautiful  tail  The  tail  of the  bird of Paradise  is the most  lovely  to the  eye  the  tail of the bird of Paradise  is the most  exquisite  to the  touch  the  tail  of the  bird of Paradise  is the  longest feathered  and the flushest  feathered tail  of all the  tails  of all the  birds  which sport in the gardens of pleasure  My pet  raven  has  ten times  a greater quantity of feathers upon its  tail    CHARE ABRS    Not the  horsetail  worn by the great cham of Tartarynot the  cow'stail  that dangles from the head of the Indian braminnot the  tail  worn by the bashaw of Turkeynot the  pigtails  which hang pendulent from the wigs of the city train'dbandsnot the  tripletails  which evince the wisdom of the learned apprentices of the law and grave serjeants of jurisprudencenot the  tails  of the learned judges of  meum  and  tuum  not the  enormous tail  of the Lord Chancellornot the  Ramillietail  of our old generalsnay nor the  mighty tail  of the famous  ram of Derby  can be compared to or  stand  in competition with the  tail  of the  bird of Paradise  I am very well acquainted with  Derby  and have often seen the  rams  of those  parts  but cannot say that I ever saw any of their  tails  larger than the  tails  of other  rams    FRRN    The  tail  of the  bird of Paradise  is not to be matched in the  British Museum  the  tail  of the  bird of Paradise  outdoes all the  tails  of all the  birds  in Sir Ashton Lever's  olyphusum  There is not such a  tail  in the  collection  of Doctor Hunter and the doctor has  tails  from all  countries  and of all  sizes  Nay not a doctor nor antiquarian in Europe possesses such a  tail  as the  tail  of the  bird of Paradise  We may say of the  tail  of the  bird of Paradise  as Yorick said of the  whitebear  Vide  Tristram Shandy Vol iv page    The  tail  of the  bird of Paradise  very well have I ever seen one might I ever have seen one am I ever to see one ought I ever to have seen one or can I ever see one  Would I had seen the  tail of the bird of Paradise  for how can I imagine it  If I should see the  tail  of the  bird of Paradise  what should I say  If I should never see the  tail  of the  bird of Paradise  what then  If I never have can must or shall see the  tail  of the  bird of Paradise  have I ever seen the  feather  of one did I ever see one painted described have I never dreamed of one did my father mother uncle aunt brothers or sisters ever see the  tail  of the  bird of Paradise  what would they give how would they behave how would the  bird of Paradise  have behaved is the tail of the  bird of Paradise  rough or smooth  Is the  tail  of the  bird of Paradise  worth seeingis there no sin in itis it better than any other  tail  Such a  tail  as the  tail  of the  bird of Paradise  does not appear once in a hundred years it glows refulgent as the  tail  of a  burning comet  yet the  tail  of the  bird of Paradise  is not a  fiery tail  but then the  tail  of the  bird of Paradise  is not  eccentrical  in its  motions  as the  tail  of a comet isit moves  to  and  fro up  and  down  like the  tail  of the  fantailed  pigeon  The  tail  of the  bird of Paradise  has  down  upon like the  tail  of a  teal  The  tail  of the  bird of Paradise  in every thingbut  motion  is  unlike  the  tail  of a  water wagtail  Here now could I disclose a  tale  upon  tails  but I might incur the displeasure of the ladies for of all  tails  the ladies hate  telltales  But if I do not give my  tale  itself I will give the  dimensions  and properties of my  tale  My  tale  exceeds in  length  the Canterbury  tales  of CHAUCERmy  tale  exceeds in  profundity  and  acuteness  the  Irish tales  of USSINmy  tale  is as  merry  a  tale  as any of the CRAZY TALESmy  tale  is as  natural  as ADAM's  tale  My EUDOSIA tells me that this is a very excellent little poem published by  Bell  but having an  indecent  tendency will not permit me to peruse it though I understand it treats in part upon the  docking of  TAILS  CPL LFT  and my  tale  is as  unfathomable  as SWIFT's  tale of a tub    But had I the  fire  of HOMER the  judgment  of VIRGILthe  salt  of HORACEthe  persuasion  of OVIDthe  imagination  of DRYDENthe  sublimity  of MILTONthe  every  thing  of SHAKESPEARE joined to the  experience  of ROCHESTER and the  abilities  of DOCTOR MADAN I should be unequal to the task of telling the  tale  of the  tail  of the  bird of Paradise    I have read this dissertation upon the  tail  of the  bird of Paradise  and think I may say to the writer as  Nell Gwynn  did to Lord Rochester who when he exclaimed  By all the Gods of  Hellespont  and  Greece    I had my  hand  upon the  GOLDEN FLEECE  Nell answered  By all the Gods of  Greece  and  Hellespont  You  LIE  my Lord your  hand was NEVER ON'T  GERTRUDE MHN    What is all this said I to myself sighing what is all this without woman  WOMAN  WOMAN Heaven's last best gift that inestimable pearl in the bitter cup of lifeNot all the springthe summer the autumn of nature can communicate real pleasure without womanand when we decline into the frigid arms of winter it is woman only can make frigid life desirable O that I may descend into the vale of death hand in hand with a silverhaired companion after travelling many a day with her through the mazy paths of lifeA companion who has soothed me and whom I have soothed at every thorny obstructiona companion who has fed with me equally chearful whether upon sour or palatable fruitA companion with whom I have strewed roses and gathered thistles  Lovely woman When thou art used kindly how ductile is thy disposition how easy thy belief how forgiving thy temper  I have lost said I by inattention an opportunity of enjoying the sweetest commerce of lifeI have lost the conversation of a beautiful and wellbred womanWith her my soul should have experienced every mortal pleasure and my senses have participated in the possession even to extasy  Here my Lord Coke came across me but his black letter made no impression upon my ideas  Counsellor  Hrge recommends the author to read  his  edition of COKE  upon  LITTLETON seventeen numbers of which he has translated from the opake distorted character of the old editions in less than six years    O woman Beauty is thy peculiar prerogativeWhy art thou so severely censured for indiscretions why should "one false step for ever damn thy fame" when all your errors are of nature and education  Formed for love moulded for pleasure with a soul warm and a heart melting with sensibility  Then ye mothers do ye not train up your daughters from their very infancy in the business of LoveDoes not their grace their dressing and their studies soften and prepare them for tender impressions  Then your virtues how they have been traducedBut I will defend them if not by argument by paraphrase  A PARAPHRASE  WHO when Bethulia's city was besieged preserved her fellowcitizen from utter ruinWoman  Judith  the wife of an obscure man whilst the city was attacked by  Holofernes  general to  Nebuchadonosor  she went to his tent as if intending to satisfy his lust but the general getting drunk and falling

servitude and bondage delivered Israel's childrenWoman  Deborah  the prophetess and  Jahel  her friend    Who with religious filial zeal unheard before offered up her life a sacrifice to heaven to save a father's vowWoman  This was the daughter of  Jephtha  but some authors say her sacrifice was much severer than  death  a vow of perpetual chastity    Who in the midst of flying arrows headed a beauteous female troop of Romans mounted on palfreys and in gay array crossed without dread old Tiber's silver flood and left Porsenna wondering at the actionWoman  This was  Celia  a beautiful young

collected of brave virtuous learned generous women of all countries and of all complexions were I to give it here would swell my book to such enormous magnitude as would frighten even those few friends who have promised to read it  On returning to my inn from the terrace I found the cloth laid and the apparatus for eating prepared and laid out with that neatness and regularity which by indicating a cleanliness in the cookery gives a kind of invitation to eat heartilybut I had no appetite for eating and dinner not being quite ready I took a file of newspapers that lay upon the window and throwing myself upon a couch read what follows  The Public Ledger  AQUATIC SPORTS  OF all  sports  whether by  land  or by  water  there never was a  sport  nor there never will be a  sport  equal to the delightful  sport  of SWANHOPPING  I have been on a party with my Lord  Praetor  sat near my Lady  Praetor  and had the honour of  tipping  a  hobnob  with Miss  Praetor    Every thing glided on smooth as the  Thames  which bore us upon his unruffled bosom till we got to  Staines  We drank copiously without danger of  suffocation  we eat plentifully without danger of  choaking  we sung we danced and cracked  bon mots  without  interruption till we got near  Staines  few of us were  halfseas over    We were near  Staines  when Miss  Praetor  in an evil minute thursting her head through the barge window and suddenly drawing it back exclaimedMammabeg pardon my Lady I meanan' please your Ladyship I see two  swans    My  operar  glass my Lord said my Lady  Praetor  to Lord  Praetor  My Lord lugged out his opera glass and presented it with a  grace  They are not  swans  my dear said her Ladyship having fixed her glass to her eye for they have no  necks  Indeed Mamma said Miss they must be  swans  for see how white they are and I protest I saw their  necks  this instantThen I can't see them answered my Lady perhaps they have plunged their necks under water my dear remarked my Lord  I will take a peep said Mrs Alderman  Haileye  I see no  nothing  said Mrs Alderman  Haileye  but I see something said Lady  Praetor  and I believe they are monsters too  and  I  perceive them now exclaimed Mrs Alderman  Haileye  but as I am a true woman I see nothing  monstrous  about themIt is a  natural  appearance said  Johnny    I am now convinced they must be  swans  said Miss taking another peep and young ones too for see Mamma they have not moulted off their  black down    If they be  cygnets  said my Lord  Praetor  we must mark themhis Lordship looked out  I am surprized said my Lord  Praetor  assuming a wise and consequential grinI am surprized that ladies who are no  chickens  and have experience should make such mistakesI thought  you  knew  things  better my dearI can't blame the child  Though I called my daughter a child on this occasion yet she was full marriageable and a rich neighbour had offered his son to her but I answered "Sir I like your son well enough but  we  that is our family don't want  cash  do you see me but to mend the blood"my neighbour was affronted and so said he "  mend your blood  damn your blood" and so do you see me he went away leaving me in a horrid state of  temerity    B KT  but in  truth do you see me my Lady your Ladyship's  swans  are two  naked men  None of your  innuendors  to me my Lord  Praetor  said my Lady  Praetor  as she waxed wrath or I will make your Lordship know as how that when you attempt to  bambozel  or  fun  me you take the wrong  sow by the ear    His Lordship was struck dumb and numbed as a torpedoMiss blushed as red as  porte  taking a third peep she had seen her mistakeand Mrs Alderman  Haileye  who had not made any mistake smiled at her triumph and looked  frumpish  This is undoubtedly a predetermined scheme to affront magistracy said my Lord  Praetor  bring the rascals before mewhat as they are exclaimed her Ladyshipyes as they  are  as they  are  replied my Lord  Your Lordship is right observed Mrs Alderman  Haileye  by bringing them as they are we shall come at the  naked truth  I wish they had  figleaves  said  Johnny  A fig for your  figleaves  retorted Lord  Praetor  there are  two figs  for them  rebutted Johnny  that  is  two figs  for each  figleaf surrebutted  Mrs Alderman  Haileye  The men were ordered to be taken into custody  All the ladies pulled out their fans spread them before their fair foreheads holding the sticks before their eyes  THE BATTLE OF STAINES  WERE I a poet I would now invoke a muse of  fire  to describe a  battle  upon the  water  The battle of all battles should be the BATTLE OF STAINES  A boat with men attendants was dispatched by my Lord  Praetor  to take into custody the two naked delinquentsbut no sooner was the boat dispatched than a doubt arose about the possibility of  griping  them The doubt was started by Lady  Praetor  who said addressing herself to Mrs Alderman  Haileye  if they overtake these  naked  wretches how will they hold themHold them said Mrs Alderman  Haileye  they must hold them by the  hair  it was the only means Adam had  to hold Eve or Eve had to hold Adam before their  fall  in Paradise said  Johnny    But that cannot be done here said Lady  Praetor  for their heads are both shaved as bald as  coots  Their  heads  are shaved said MissThere is no more hair upon their  heads  than upon my daughter's  upper lip  said Lord  Praetor    Miss  Praetor  hummed and stroaked her  upper lip  with her  forefinger    They must hold them  where  and  how  they can said Mrs Alderman  Haileye  for my part it is What  I  would do were I on the partyPray Mamma said Miss pointing with her  finger  as if to illustrate her interrogatorywhat part would  you  take hold of  A dead pause ensued  The boat pursued the menthe men swam from the boatbut the boat could not overtake the  men  so the  women  were  disappointed  The men took refuge under the bridge of  Staines    The people of  Staines  saw the pursuit they considered the matter as a common  causeThe  women  of  Staines  were melted into compassion by the danger in which they saw the naked menthey saw every  thing  and they felt for every  thing  they sawIn short the men women and children of  Staines  let fly all kinds of missive weapons upon the deputies of my Lord  Praetor    Alderman  Swindle  In consequence of the great courage and  manoeuvre  shewn by me this day and my  unparalleled  condust on  sundry other  occasions the  Common Council  have  exempted  me from serving in future on any committee or in any city office and such is their respect for me that for some time past they have made it a point to let me eat drink and walk  by myself  and in conversation none of them ever presumes to answer me  SWINDLE  Ald  standing upon the poop of the city barge saw the danger which threatened Lord  Praetor  's delegatesshall I exclaimed Alderman  Swindle  shall I who  saw  prisons burned and houses consumed stand an idle spectator while defiance is thrown in the teeth of Lord  Praetor  's orders I will fly to the bridge of  Staines  vociferated Alderman  Swindle  and seizing a  punt  that  lay close to the barge he paddled towards the bridge  The peasantry of  Staines  not distinguishing the Alderman's  dignity  by his person did not know that his person was a legal object of magisterial  worship  so seizing upon the stones which lay scattered on the beach and bridge attacked him in his  punt  from the  shore  and from the  battlements    With his right arm the Alderman wielded a  mop  he levelled his  mop  at the mob on the bridge but the erring weapon falling short of the intended mark was seized by one of the enemy  Oh for the pen of Homer  The villain peasant poizing the mopstick with true rustic skill like Jove's lightning flying from his hand it cut the liquid air and striking upon the  cranium  of the magistrate must inevitably have dispatched his soul to  Erebus  if Nature from a preknowledge of this fight had not formed the head of her favourite son of genuine Aldermanic mould hard and impenetrable as that which  composed the  caput mortuum  of the Styxdipped AchillesThe mop rebounding from the  sconce  of Alderman  Swindle  fell into the water  The barge coming up the parties landed and now hostilities commenced on shore The mob of  Staines  surrounded the Aldermanic body and if  Peace  in likeness to a magistrate of the county had not seasonably appeared and interposed a general massacre might have ensued and the city have been left to mourn her murdered magistrates and their myrmidons  SQUIB  I have read several letters under the signature of Squib in the Public Ledger and have always found them delectable in the perusal This writer notwithstanding the name he has assumed appears to me to possess  experience ability  and  stability  and not to be one of those young sparks who as  Sir Archy Mac Sarcasm  says in  Love a la Mode  "go off like a  squib  or a  cracker  "L  y  HUE  PortrianSq    VinegarYard DruryLane  Aug    DINNER  I Had scarce finished Mr Squib's account of the battle of  Staines  when dinner was served inI sat down to eat but had no appetiteand without appetite the best meat with the most poignant sauces are insipid In truth I had no sauce not even  hunger  I always eat my meat  plain  but now I could not eat my  plain  meat  Not being able to eat I called for drink I tasted the beerthe beer was stale I tasted the cyderthe cyder was sour "Wine" says the Prophet "makes the heart of man glad" the text came across me like a cheering ray I rung the bell and ordered a bottle of port  While the waiter was gone for the wine I recollected that though he and the rest  of the family were ignorant of the Lady's name and residence yet it was probable the Landlord might have some knowledge of her determining to enquire I rung again to order him in but he saved me the trouble of giving orders by appearing with a bottle of port in his hand  THE LANDLORD  MINE host was one of those geniuses who like MACKLIN's Sir  Pertinax Mac Sycophant  depended more upon  bowing  than on education and natural abilities  he could never  stand straight  in the presence of a  guest    and to the  pliability  of Sir  Pertinax  he added the complaisance of SHAKESPEARE's  Polonius  being ever of the same opinion with the person he conversed with unless that person was his wife or one of his servants and these he eternally contradicted whether they were right or whether they were wrong  Mine host having made half a dozen obsequious  bows  and eyed me from head to foot with the circumspection of a serjeant eying a young recruit cautiously wiped the dust from the bottle viewing it at the same time  with an expressive look which fully evinced he would have me understand the wine was old  It will bear the decanter said II pledge my life upon it Sir said mine host drawing forth the cork with a jerk attended by a smack from his mouth accompanied by a smack from the bottle which not only advertised me of the length of the cork but of the good opinion which the landlord entertained of his liquor  There is not better port in the  king's cellar  said my landlord winking  I can take upon me to say that if the landlord by this expression and  wink  meant to insinuate that his  port  had ever been in the  king's cellar  he was an imposing rascal for ever since I came to superintend the houshold I have taken special care not only of  whole  bottles and  whole  joints but of  pieces  of bottles and  broken  victuals  TLBT  filling out a glass and presenting it to meit is all flavour like an olive and is bright as a ruby said he holding the glass between his eye and the window  I tasted the portit was tartit would not dothe landlord  bowed  moving his head in  a manner that I might take either as a polite assent or humble contradiction of my opinion but at the same time laying his hand upon his breast swore it was two years in in bottleI tasted the port again as a complimentary return to his bow but before I could take the glass from my lips he assured my  honour  that the  Prince of Wales  had drank of and approved this very wine  I felt the full force of the  compliment  and of the  recommendation  the compliment deserved a return and the recommendation it was not in my power to controvert so returning "  your honour  " with a nod of approbation and giving up my  taste  to the palate of the Prince of Wales I swallowed what remained in the glass  FLATTERY  THE  manner  in which my landlord had recommended his port was irresistible and perhaps had I changed the bottle for another I should have got  worse  wine with more  bows  and an assurance that his  majesty  had drank a bottle from the same binthere would have been no withstanding the force of  royal  authority  It is astonishing what an  influence  royal authority has upon the human mindI do not mean in politics though heaven knows we have  quacks  enough in both houses pretending to administer  medicines  to the  consumptive constitution  of the  state  but I mean its operation in favour of the slow poisons which are daily administered by  quack doctors  and which have no virtue but what they derive from the use of the  King'sarms    ANONYMOUS  but growing impatient to enquire after my fair fellowtraveller my  honour  condescended to ask my landlord to take a glass which after half a dozen  bows  he accepted  Yet by heaven the wine was  sour  but FLATTERY took off its tartnessand no wonder  flattery  should vitiate the  taste  when we know its baneful effects upon all the other sensesWhere is there a philosopher however cynical who cannot through some medium be approached by flattery's honied influence Flattery is the  touch  that proves the value and purity of the understanding  Gold tries the  integrity  of the  heart  flattery the  strength  of the  brain    Where is the king who can withstand or when was there a king who could withstand unmoved the adulating baseness of the flattering vermin tribe The  best  monarchs have been undone by such miscreants they have converted the  worst  into devils  DETRACTION  MY landlord being seated and I having described my fellowtraveller to him as minutely as possible expatiating upon her perfections as I touched upon them that is such of her  perfections  as  distinguished  her from the rest of her sex for there are  perfections common  to them allI say having minutely described my fellowtraveller to my landlord he run over a catalogue of the beauties of Windsor and the adjacent country which he had at his tongue's end with a most surprizing flow of volubility accuracy of description point of sarcasm and now and then the sweetness of eulogium  If it was not for her black hair said my landlord I should be positive she was Miss A  Miss B is too proud to travel in a stagecoachtherefore it cannot be Miss B  The widow Chas not been in London since her husband's death he was buried on Monday besides I know she had a private cardparty last night so it is impossible your honour that this lady should be the widow C  There is a young lady in the neighbourhood who answers your description but she is continually practising smiles before the glass to insnare the princenonoit is not Miss D  You say Sir the lady is wellshaped and wittynow if her back was broke from her wit I should really think she was Mrs E  Miss Fhas a roguish eyebut your lady's eyes are  blue  and Miss F's are  black  and she squints with her left eye and is ever speaking scandal so it cannot be Miss F  If Miss Ghad not  slipped her ancle  as many ladies have since the huntingseason commencedyou  understand  me  green gowns  have been very fashionable in the neighbourhood of Windsor since hunting became the sport of the great  In short my host took great pains to inform me that the lady I enquired after was neither Mrs nor Miss nor the widow A B C D E F G c c c and this he did wherever he had opportunity with a malignant stroke of detraction  The fellow had a tongue of charcoal with which he burned or blackened the reputation of every person she spoke ofWherever he gave  credit  for a  virtue  or good action he never failed to  balance  the  account  at the  debit  side of the bookwith an insiduous  hint  or charge of  defamation    I changed the subject of conversation  POLITICKS  I Suppose said I pointing to the Ledger which I had thrown aside when dinner was served in I suppose my friend that since the court has honoured Windsor with the light of its countenance the inhabitants have become profound politicians  I am of no party answered my landlord though to be sure what with excise and what with quartering of soldiers a publican can scarce live  But as taxes rise you charge in proportion said I  True Sir replied my landlord we charge in proportion but then our guests eat and drink in proportion they order as  little  as possible and eat as  much  as possible that is when they are charged for each articlebut Sirif they dine at the ordinary or agree  for so much a head they eat as if it was the last meal they had to devour and scarcely drink sufficient to wash the food down their throatsAlas Sir I have had very few good companies in the drinking way since the last general election and those who drank then drank at the expence of the candidates  And what was your opinion on that election said I  OpinionO your honour I never formed any opinion on ita man who depends upon the custom of the public should never have an opinion of his ownI am not one of those publicspirited publicans who neglect their own business to look after the affairs of the stateit is true I hear a great deal of talk among my guests about the  king's friends  and  opposition  now your  king's friends  I take to be those who are friends to themselves  with  successand  opposition  I take to be those who have been friends to themselves  without  successthere ever was and there ever will be  parties  your honour  THOSE IN  WILL GRIN  and  THOSE OUT  WILL POUT  and as to our great  speechifiers  the  more  they say whether  in  or  out  of place the  less  I believe them  We have senators whose eloquence is not less admirable than their  fortitude  who know the  principles  and desend the  rights  of human nature who possess  virtue  equal to their  genius  and who prefer their  honour  to all the  riches  which ambitious meanness can extort  EDMUND BURKE  I admire an irresistible eloquence never  prostituted  to  falshood  or  denied  to  truth  for such eloquence must convince every mind not debased by voluntary and incorrigible error  GEORGE SAVILE  Eloquence in the hands of a good man is the most glorious gift of nature it makes him the sanctuary of the unfortunate the protector of the weak the support and praise of the honest and eternal terror and controul of the bad  CAMDEN  but let who will be  in  or who will be  out  it is all the same to me and if your honour wishes to know how the election was carried on in Windsor here your honour look to that there LEDGER and it will inform you  So saying he took up the LEDGER and laid it before me on the table and after half a dozen of bows told me he would go and make every possible enquiry to find out the lady  A SOLILOQUY  THOSE  in  will  grin  those  out  will  pout  well said landlord  I have read Machiavel Sidney Locke Swift Hume Johnson and a hundred other authors and arguers in politicks on both sides of the question and after all my reading my landlord who probably has not read a hundred pages since he left school is as sound a judge of politicks and politicians as I amhis adage includes the whole system  THOSE IN  WILL GRIN  THOSE OUT  WILL POUT  It should be engraven in  brass  and hung up over the entrance of the temple of  corruption  My house was a house of prayer but lo ye have made it a den of thieves  ST STEPHEN    O blessed liberty let me here pay a tribute at thy shrine  HYMN TO LIBERTY  This hymn was written by an Irish  curate  of great learningN BIt is thought he will never rise in the church  M      SISTER of JOVE aethereal flame  Who bid'st the livid lightnings roll  Mov'st to soft harps the sphery frame  And wak'st to extacy the soul  O parentsource of every good  Arrang'd thro' ev'ry nice degree  How few have justly understood  Those laws of order fram'd by thee  For thee the  Poet  's strain shall flow  Inspirer of the vocal strings  And  Philomel  forget her woe  To praise thee by whose aid she sings  For thee gay  Zephyr  waves his plume  Thine are the od'rous gifts he bears  Thy hours unlock each varying bloom  And wake to life the laughing years  Thy mail of old did  Greece  invest  What time the haughty  Persian  fled  Thy terrors no ded from her crest  When  Rome  rais'd high her awful head  O who are now the chosen race  For whom thou leav'st thy lucid

of th' extatic breast  'Tis BRITAIN thy best influence owns  And dumb respect and slavish fear  Bids the mind waft to eastern thrones  She happier far while thou art near  There are six more stanzas to this hymn which for political reasons that shall be set forth in the  second  edition of this  work  are now suppressed    THE SOLILOQY CONTINUED  WHY should I be so anxious why so dull continued I reasoning with myself heaviness of spirit is an evidence of folly and the most manifest sign of wisdom is a chearful mindThis landlord of mine without the aid of literature knows the very depth and main spring of politicks and without the aid of philosophick study has discovered the very perfection of all it can teachthat the perfection of wisdom is to be merry and content for the seat of wisdom is always clear and serene  Give me then that philosophy and let me ever study those precepts and those precepts alone which teach me to live with chearfulness  and shew me how to die without concern Save me from subtilties which only distract the understanding without improving the heart  Demetrius  the grammarian finding in the temple of Delphos a knot of philosophers in chearful conversation said to them  either I am much deceived or by your chearful and pleasant countenances you are not engaged in any deep discourse  To which  Heraclean  the magician replied  It is for such as are puzzled about enquiring whether the future tense of the verb  be spelled with a double λ or that hunts after the derivation of the comparatives  and the superlatives  to knit their brows in their discourses upon science but as to philosophical discourses they always divert and cheer up those they entertain and never deject them or make them sad  You may read this in our countenancesJOHNSON  of the Lexicon  HARRIS  of the Hermes    As I am no philosopher no more than our author the  impressions  of  passion  do not operate  superficially  upon me but  penetrate  even to the  seat  of  reason Lady  GRVSR    Make me  honest  kind heaven and you make me equal to any situation in lifeand having made me  honest  I have no objection to your making me  great  for  honesty  can enjoy  riches power authority and honours with as much integrity as she can suffer poverty oppression slavery and disgraceShe can  sleep  upon a bed of  down  as  soundly  as she can  sleep  upon a truss of  straw  she can be  innocent  in a palace as in a  cottage  and shew as much  humility  in a glorious  equipage  as when she  walks barefoot  upon the highway but when  honesty  finds herself elevated in life then her peculiar office is to know the  use  and how to  use  the good things she possesses and her peculiar virtue to part with them without murmuring  I am intimately acquainted with a Welsh Gentleman who fully answers this descriptionThe great admire him the poor respect and love him  W W WYNNE    Having eased my mind by a few minutes reflectionI took up the  Ledger  and read  ELECTIONEERING INTELLIGENCE EXTRAORDINARY  LORD PRAETOR Lady  Praetor  and Miss  Praetor  were sitting at table enjoying the sweets of domestic tranquillity over the remnant of a pint bottle of port having just swallowed the secondhand fragments of a recooked mutton hash when an attendant entered and delivered a letter into Lord  Praetor  's hand  His Lordship looking eagerly upon the seal gave a sudden starthis eyes stood fixed in their orbits and those masticators which but the moment before had cooperated in assaulting the mutton hash regardless of their natural alliance assaulted each other with reiterated violence His Lordship broke open the letter and fixing his eyes upon the superscription  an universal ague instantly took possession of his nervous system each cold fit being succeeded with a most violent paroxysm of heat  Lady  Praetor  and Miss were all attention his Lordship read on  Papa's all in a  muck  my dear whispered Lady  Praetor  to MissYes my Lady answered Miss in the same toneThere is  something  in the  wind  replied Missthere is  something  in the  wind  rejoined my Lady taking a pinch of snuff I  smell  a  rat  Odd  rat  it exclaimed my Lord I have been alarmed my dear into a  pispiration  never was I in such a  quandary  beforeLady  Praetor  took up the letter and read  Now my Lord  Praetor  's face during his confusion neither blushed red like the declining sun nor grew pale like the rising moon yet his Lordship's face had a coelestial appearanceit reflected a thousand colours like an  Aurora Borealis  or in more homely phrase my Lord  Praetor  's phiz while he perused this mandatory letter for such it was  looked like the welkin when the merry dancers prance and caper upon her bosom till after exhibiting a variety of dyes it settled in a colour something between madder red and Coventry blue  This letter must be obeyed said Lady  Praetor  throwing the letter upon the table  This was a commandatory letter ordering Lord  Praetor  to exert his whole interest against a popular candidate    This letter must be obeyed echoed my Lord  Praetor  pushing the letter towards Miss  This letter must be obeyed reechoed Miss  Praetor  who had read it over her Mamma's shoulder  But how can it be obeyed said my Lord  Praetor  I cannot be in two places at once But your Lordship Papa may get into  three places  by obeying it said MissI am to preside in the city upon Friday said my LordThen I will go to  Vindsor  myself offered my LadyI can manage a  poll  as  well as your LordshipI know your Ladyship can my love said Lord  Praetor    What coloured ribbands shall we wear enquired Missnone of their city colours I hope one Alderman has already mounted  blue  cockades  Then I will go to  Vindsor  myself said my LordSince there are  blue  cockades in the city I will go to  Vindsor  for I would rather face the  Devil  than a blue cockade  Many animals have a particular aversion to particular  colours  thus a  Turkeycock  has an aversion to  red  and it lately appeared that the Board of Aldermen and Westminster Justices shewed a horrid aversion to  blue    ANONYMOUS  I will appoint a  locum trimmings  to fill the city chairI wish he may  trim  the  plebeians  well said Lady  Praetor  This election business will make us up if we succeed said Lady  Praetor  and get a  star and garter  at least for Papa observed MissNo man could  become  the  star and garter  better said my Lady  My Lady  Praetor  said no more than I merited no man ever  became  the  bar  of the  star and garter  better than I did and if his  Grace  my neighbour had not paid  high  I should never have left my  tavern  which his  Grace  thought a  nuisance  to turn  Vinemerchant  O I wish I may  become  the  bar  of the  King'sbench  where next term I am to receive sentence as well as I  became  the  bar  of the  star and garter    B K      Miss pursued the subject  I wish said Miss  Praetor  I wish there was an order of  knights  for ladies good lud Mamma we might be knightedO gemini Papa how the gentlemen would admire at seeing our  stars and garters  as we walked Humph said my Lord with a grin but you are innocent my dear and as the French  mottor  has itHONEY SWEAT KEY MEAL WITH PENCEBut as this is to be a  gratus  business we shall have no occasion for our own carriage and horses We will have a postcoach from the  Swan  with two necks I will have nothing that has any thing to do with a  swan  said my LadyWe have had enough of  swanhopping  already added Miss  Then my dear said Lord  Praetor  we will have a carriage from the  Bell and Savage  and the Landlord's four  bobtail  bays to draw us  Bob  me none of your  bobtails  my Lord exclaimed Lady  Praetor  I am not to be  bobbed  out of my dignity in that manner neitherI will have my own carriage and  long tails  Well now Mamma said Miss  Praetor  joining in the conversation with a smile ineffable well now though I acknowledge  longtails  carry the  belle  in the city yet for a country excursion give me  cocktails  against the globe  Cocktails  are the very thing Mammaindeed they are all the  ton  nothing but  cocktails  go down in the  vis à vis  line at the west end of the town  I will yet have a  phiz à vee  said Lady  Praetor  but consider my dear continued her Ladyship we are going on business that requires solemnity and procession and the  longtails  are  best  at  slow  going  True Mamma replied Miss but then the present business requires  expedition  and in a  quick trot  or  canter  the  cocktails  have every advantageBut my dear the  flowing manes  on the  necks  of the  longtails  look so  grand  said my LadyTrue Mamma but the  cocktails  carry their  heads  so  prettily    Come come my love said Lord  Praetor  venturing to put in a word  you  are the best judge of the subjectWhat say you my dear  longtails  or  cocktails  for the journey I wish to oblige the child answered Lady  Praetor  but this time I must have my own way the next  bout  I will indulge her  taste  for  cocktails  but this  bout  I will indulge my own  taste  and drive with  longtails    My Lord  Praetor  and Miss acquiesced  Things being thus adjusted and the coach at the door ready to drive for Windsor not according to the old saying  cocktail  every yard but  longtail  every inch her Ladyship as she stepped into the carriage called out to the coachman  Vindsor a hoi  JohnMy dear said Lord  Praetor  we are not going in the  city barge    Plague on the city barge ejaculated Lady  Praetor  ever since our last unfortunate voyage  in it to  Staines  I can never get the adventures of the day  out  of my headNor can I get any thing else  into  my head said MissPoor Alderman  Swindle  got a  mopstick  on his head said my Lord  Rattle rattle rattle over the stones to Hydepark corner  KensingtonHammersmith in a long trot  Kewbridge in a canter  Windsor in full gallop  Huzza huzza huzza Windsor Windsor  No Keppel No Keppel roared my Lord from the right side of the coach  No Keppel No Keppel roared my Lady from the left side  Miss sat ruminating on the  necks  of the  Windsor swans    The coach having stopped my Lord went to the  hustings  beribbanded and cockaded my Lady went  canvassing  and Miss whose mind was  pregnant  with the idea of the  swans  she had seen on the expedition to  Staines  took a solitary walk by the  Thames  side to  speculate  upon the beautiful  productions of nature  Every stable and outhouse that could be procured in Windsor was divided and subdivided to create votes  against  Admiral Keppel Admiral Keppel was  ousted  from representing the  borough  of Windsorso he went into Surry and was elected by the free suffrages of the independent freeholders to represent the COUNTY  THE MESSAGE  I HAD scarcely laid down the LEDGER when my servant entered the roomhis mouth extended to the dimension of a countertenor choirister's mouth when vociferating "O thou that bringeth glad tidings to Sion" He bounced in  sans  ceremony and rubbing the palms of his hand together with a quickness and zeal that intimated good news and satisfaction told me he had found the Lady  And where is she and what is her name said I leaping from my chair with the utmost eagernessI cannot say Sir answered my servant where the Lady is or who the Lady is but a boy waits to deliver a letter to the Gentleman who came down in the stage he says it is from a Ladyand as I came down an  outside  passenger it cannot be for meand as  you Sir were the only gentlemen  inside  passenger I conclude it must be for you  I ordered the boy to be called in  He was a lad about fourteen in a neat frock liveryI have a letter Sir said the boy without a direction but my Mistress has ordered me to deliver it to the Gentleman who came to Windsor this day in the stage I held out my hand for the letter tore it open and read  I impute your omitting to enquire after my name to emotions similar to those which agitated my bosom at the minute of our departure and I suppose you have been travelling over the whole town to find me out  It is what I should have been doing said I stamping and cursing my remissness and stupidity  if a more serious engagement does not call for your attendance I shall hope for your company as soon after you receive this as convenient and you must conduct yourself before those you will see with me as an old acquaintance  MARIA  My respects said I to your Mistress slipping a trifle into the boy's handI shall wait upon her immediatelyThe boy retired  In about ten minutes I was dressed These ten minutes appeared an hourIn twenty minutes was at the houseNever did  necessitous  tradesman going humbly to petition a privileged  great  man to pay a  small  debt of  long  standing feel a more general agitation of nerves or knock with a more trembling hand than I felt and than I knocked with at the door of  Maria  's lodgings  THE MEETING  TURNING my head aside accidentally as I knocked at the door I saw  Maria  peep over the windowblind but when shewed into the parlour I found her sitting with her back turned towards the door a book in her hand supporting herself by her elbow which rested on the arm of the chair She was seemingly so lost in meditation that had I not seen her peep over the parlourblind I should have thought she had neither heard me coming in nor had seen me when I was inI gave a loud hemthe boy announced my entrance"the Gentleman Madam" and he withdrew  Maria  started from her seat as roused from a reverieI should have suspected her of duplicity but the crimson glow that flushed in her cheek convinced me that the pretended  reverie was not a manoeuvre of experience or practised art but an immediate consequence of amiable confusion  The moment our eyes met I perceived and felt for  Maria  's situationSuspicion fled and the ardour of passion which succeeded was instantly checked by the interposition of sentimentMy eyes bent downwards the confusion which revelled in her cheek had raised a tumult within her bosom Our feelings were mutualour hands guided by instinctive attraction joined imperceptibly till a reciprocal gentle pressure convinced us of their junctionPassion stepped in again but sentiment still kept her postwe sighed at one instant as with one breathat one instant we received reliefyet to speak was impossiblethough  Maria  's eyes expressed unutterable thingsmine perhaps were not without expressionat least  Maria  has since told me so  I had always an aversion to  punctilio  no man in the world understands less or pays less attention to those who practise  ettiquette  than I dobut ceremony in the present instance was out of the question  Nature  predominated and under her sweet influence I led the Lady to her chair placed her on it and placing myself upon another chair close by her without uttering a single compliment or a single bow or courtsey being passed on my part or her's  I led her to her chair "Grace was in all her steps" Grace which the VESTRIS could never teach nor nobility could never learn for it is neither to be taught nor learnedit was the  grace  of Nature  If you were to see my little memorandum book you would acknowledge notwithstanding the above insinuation that I taught several  ladies  the true  natural grace  and have received large emoluments for teaching the same but the contents of this little book I shall keep  secret  till safe upon the continent when I shall  publish  it as a grateful return for all  favours  received from the  ladies  of GreatBritain and that my gratitude may not hereafter be called in question I have added to my catalogue many  favours  which I  never  received but which shall also be published  THE VESTRIS  It was such  grace  as her  Grace  the Dutchess of D nor her  Grace  the Dutchess of Rnever  exhibited in  public  no not even when led out by the first dancers of the court to walk the  minuet de la cour  But when his  Grace  the Duke of D or his  Grace  the Duke of R lead forth the partners of their love in  private  to practise the  minuet de la coeur  no doubt their  graces  then may shew as  graceful  a deportment as now  gracefully  marked the person and steps of my  Maria  But I have seen a Lady whose name is GRACE whose person is  grace  whose face is  grace  but above all whose  mind  is  grace  itselfGood heaven if she would but smile  graciously  upon me    Two minuets passed without a word being utteredthey were golden minuets worth a whole iron age  Maria  had dropped her book from her hand as it approached minethe book lay upon the ground I took it upit was TRISTRAM SHANDY  TRISTRAM SHANDY  HAD  Sterne  Madam said I as I opened the bookHad  Sterne  experienced such a tender meeting as the present he could have written a whole volume upon the text  I was considering answered  Maria  when you came in what a pity it was that  Sterne  lest the description of the  Widow Wadman  's person and beauty to the imagination of his reader and had not drawn the Lady's picture himselfAlas Madam said I had  Sterne  drawn the widow's picture it would only have increased his enemies and heaven knows the benignity of his heart and simplicity of his manners had raised enough of themHis description Madam would have pleased few but himself the critics would have fallen foul upon it would have dissected it to a hair have tortured it limb by limb  bedaubed it and besmutted it for in the article of beauty we seldom find two men who think alike some admire slender some admire full waists  One of the first personages in this country indulging with me in the amorous dalliance of a retired  tete à tete  gave me his opinion upon this subject he declared his dislike to the antiquated figures of former days described by  Pope  "small by degrees and beautifully less" exclaiming at the same time in rapturegive me  quantity  I despise  quality  give me  latitude  and  longitude  in  love    ARMSTEAD  spinster  a tint in the complexion or a shade in the colour of the eye settles the admiration and gives birth to passion  It is the same with women answered  Maria  they are equally capricious in their likings and affectionsSome women like  tall  menothers like  middlesized  and some like  short  men  Being  short  myself I made a low bow  Your observation Madam said I is just an inch this way or an inch that way may gain or lose the affections of a woman and as to the affections of men they are not  confined to beauty to figure or mental acplishments I have often remarked old men fond of green girls and young fellows giving preference to fullblown beautybut these are false appetites  False appetites exclaimed  Maria  starting and looking towards heavenAlas Sir it is too true that the devastation in the gardens of beauty and innocence are generally made by old wretchesHer bosom heaved as if burstingher whole frame was in agitation I finished the sentence for herold wretches who lay  waste  but cannot  enjoy  the soil  We have remarked two old fellows of this diabolical cast who constantly take their evening amusement during the summer season in Vauxhall gardens and who in winter have old  haradans  in constant pay priestesses to Satan at whose shrine they nightly offer up human sacrifices  FLH and HSG    A shower of tears burst from  Maria  's eyes and stole down her cheek I wiped them off but not with a handkerchief  A SHANDEAN CONVERSATION  PERCEIVING the distress of my fair friend though unable to account for the cause  The history of  Maria  shall be given in the course of this work if the REVIEWERS will but assist the sale of the first volume by  abusing  it  THE AUTHOR  I changed the subject by taking up  Tristram Shandy  which I had laid upon the parlourwindow and accidentally opening the page where the author promises a chapter upon  buttonholes  it is a pity said I turning to  Maria  and affecting a sprightliness to relieve her spiritsit is a pity said I that  Tristram  never filled this chapterdo you mean the  black  leaf said  Maria  I answered no  I could never penetrate into the moral of that dark page said  Maria    I do believe said I it is an emblem of the black ingratitude of the world  Then continued Maria since you do not mean the black you must mean the marble page and that page is to me as inexplicable as the other  I do not think answered I that there is any great difficulty to unravel the truths which lie mystically hid under the veil of the marble pageI consider it as a true picture of the  hard  marble  heads  and  hard  marble  hearts  of those envious dull ones who persecuted him while living and pray add said  Maria  of those unfeeling dull ones who could not understand or benefit by reading the dictates of his philanthropy  I resumed the subject of the  buttonhole    Had he filled his chapter upon buttonholes said I it would have been delectable  He would have  filled  it in all probability observed  Maria  but poor fellow you should  recollect his misfortuneyou should recollect he was grievously afflicted with a consuming  asthma  the whole time he was composing his works  I see the force of your observation said I a man debilitated as he must have been with death pursuing him at every step and shaking his dart at him upon every turn had something more material to employ his  mind  and of course employ his  pen  than such trifling subjects as  buttonholes  True said  Maria  but come you appear in perfect health and spirits so let me see what you can say upon the subjecthere is a blank page continued  Maria  taking Tristram Shandy out of my handhere is a white blank page turning over to chapter XXXVIII in the IVth VOLUME come I will have an immediate proof of your literary abilities  So saying she brought pen and ink and placing the blank chapter in Shandy before me on a tablewrite write said  Maria  while I go order tea  THE BUTTONHOLE  A BUTTONHOLE  WHAT could  Sterne  possibly have said upon a  buttonhole  Would he have  entered  into its  origin  Would he have described it with all its appendages and ornaments  Would he have explained its uses its shape and its component parts  Would he have given us all those ideas which must consequently have arisen before his mind's eye in the course of considering and discussing the subject  Heaven only knows whether he would have done  all  which these interrogatories enquire but clear I am that had he once taken the subject in hand he would have done his  best  and the  best  can do no more though the subject to be handled was the  best in Christendom  This is the  meritricious  colouring of eloquence  THRLW  Cancel    But as I am not endowed with powers natural nor acquired corporeal nor intellectual sufficient to support me should I rashly attempt to  enter  into so  deep  and  profound  a subject a subject which would baffle the  pens  of the  Royal Society  or  Sorbonne  a subject which has exhausted whole folios of learning and employed the leisure hours of the most learned menI will not presume Madam to inform you what a  buttonhole  is though having  seen  many and  felt  more I will venture to tell you what a  buttonhole  is  like    The  buttonhole  of a  pocket  being  vertical  is like a  parenthesis  closed thus☞  The  buttonhole  of the  breast  being  horizontal  is also like a  parenthesis  but inversed thus☞    View a  buttonhole  which way you will change its position ever so oftentake it in whatever manner you pleaseit is a  parenthesis  still  Split  the word  parenthesis  in twain and by the addition of one letter t you have a double  illustration  of this  dark  subject  The  first  syllable will be  parent  now a  buttonhole  is a  parent  for by a proper use of it in  conjunction  with a  button  it nourishes a man by keeping him warm in cold weather  The  second  syllable will be  thesis  now the  buttonhole  is a  thesis  which has produced much dispute in the world  nam fuit ante Helenam cunnus causa deterrima bellis  for my part I know nothing of the  theory  but being naturally of an aguish constitution am liable to  hotfits  and  coldfits  which cause me to  button  or  unbutton  as I am  hot  or  cold  I have had my share of  buttonholepractics    And pray Sir who first made use of  buttonholes    With submission to their  reverences  who are bound  ex officio  to understand these things  better than laymen I suppose that the button and  buttonhole  is as ancient as  Adam  and  Eve  and were first used by them in joining their  figleaves together  for as our first parents had neither  needle  nor  thread  is it possible the use of something like a  button  and  buttonhole  was discovered by them  And why not a  needle  and  thread  Sir Might not  Adam  procure a  thorn  for  Eve  to serve as a  needle  and might not  Eve  give a  lock  of her  hair  to serve as a  thread  and this  needle  and  thread  being thus procured it is not possible or at least probable that  Adam  and  Eve stitched  their  figleaves together  Whether they  buttoned  or  stitched  their  figleaves  together in my opinion does not signify a farthingbut the learned Hebraists think otherwise  Several men of extensive learning have written whole volumes in controverting such  essential  points of scripture and frequently preach upon them to the great  entertainment  of  themselves  and  punishment  of their  auditors  PRY D D  in his Collection of Old Ballads    Put in the button xxxxxxxxxxxxxxs  It will be matter of great doubt to future generations whether these x's mean the crosses attending  buttons  and  buttonholes  or whether they represent the  number of times  a lady's  ridinghabit  ought to be buttoned in the yearI say future generations for my book will be read while  buttons  and  buttonholes  are in being which will be when  Junius  c c shall be forgotten  THE AUTHOR  here having filled the blankleaf I could proceed no further so turned it down that Maria might peruse it at her leisure  TWO CHARACTERS  MARIA returned just as I had closed the book and desired me to follow her repeating her caution that I should conduct myself as an old acquaintanceshe ushered me into a drawingroom neatly furnished in the old stile the chairbottoms the curtains and even the pictures were of needlework  The floor which was of old oak glistered with a burnished lustre and every article of the furniture had from frequent friction acquired a shining polish In one corner stood a tambourframe in another corner an aparatus for paintinga grey parrot occupied a window on the right a breedingcage of Canarybirds occupied a window on the left and on a large marble slabtable which stood under a long oldfashioned pierglass two turtles billed and cooed in amorous dalliance  There were also two tabbycats their fur unsullied as ermine purring by the sireside and a little French lapdog with his companion big with pup slumbered upon a cushion  The lady of the mansion exhibited as evident marks of female industry as her furniture Every article of her dress at least every thing that appeared was ornamented with needlework and though in  dishabille  all was neat and pinned on with a systematic accuracy  This lady was tall and slender her waist scarce a span her face forming an accute angle at the chin her nose prominent and her skin tight to her cheekbones as if braced out of those wrinkles which a few treacherous gray hairs peeping from under a black wig informed the beholder it was intitled toshe had but  one  eye but then that eye projected so far from out its socket and had such a convenient power of turning on its swivel  Though there is no name mentioned here yet we are clearly of opinion that an information will lie  in Banco Regis  provided any lady living in Windsor will swear she believes herself to be the person alluded toWALLS  Att G  MAD  S  l G  Some time ago the above learned gentlemen in argument at the bar maintained that  swivels  and  guns  were entirely different things I in answer insisted that though all  guns  were not  swivels  yet all  swivels  were  guns  and illustrated by observing that all  swiveleyes  were  eyes  though all  eyes  were not  swiveleyes  The learned gentlemen looking in each other's  face  were convinced  J DNNG  that it kept constant guard upon  her  blind side  and was mistress of a perpetual motion which gave it all the qualities of the hundred eyes of  Argus  for it took within its pupil which was ornamented with a small pearl contrasting a  coral  circle that embraced the ball not only every object in front but every object on each side  Having sketched out this virgin's person for she was unmarried had preserved an untainted fame and was not one of those hypocrites who have no pretence to chastity themselves but by their severity to the impure I must say something of her mind with which I soon became intimately acquainted She was a wit a satyrist a critic and a writer  with a tongue ever pretending service to her neighbours but in its qualities contrary to that of the fox which heals whereas the tongue of Miss  Verjuce  operated upon a character as the medicine of a pretending quack operates upon the body and never parted it till as the devil left Job the tortured character became a sore all over  With this damsel sat a military gentleman not less than sixty whose regimentals of scarlet faced with green velvet exhibited the fashionable cut of twenty years pastHis stature was tall his shoulders broad his appearance dignified his eye penetrating and his face though furrowed by time wore a smile of pleasantry that shewed he had grown old with good humour and could support age with a good grace A vernacular broad pronunciation declared him an Irishman and his attentive politeness soon convinced me he had held a commission of rank in a foreign service He bore a deep scar upon his forehead in testimony of his courage and the  croix de St Louis  pending  from his buttonhole by a ribband evinced his having received at least an honorary reward from the prince under whose standard he had fought  On this object the eye of Miss  Verjuce  kept continual play which was returned by an assiduous attention to please on the part of the man of warShe was his admirer he pretended to be her's and she believed him from the favourable opinion she entertained of her meritsO  Vanity  thou art a fault of the first magnitude in womanthe cause of her greatest misfortuneseven  Poverty  is not a greater enemy to her honourand never had woman a greater share of vanity than the woman I have describedshe was vain of her understanding but that was excusable her glass could not shew its deformityshe was vain of her person that was astonishing for the sight of it must have reproved and humbled her every time she sat at her toilet  TEATABLECHAT  THE Captain soon discovered I was his countryman and no sooner made the discovery than he discharged a volley of interrogatories at me in succession as quick as a  feu de joy    Merciful heaven Captain exclaimed Miss  Verjuice  a cessation of questions and let the conversation be generalPray Sir continued she turning full upon me is there any likelihood that the present  unnatural  war will have a speedy termination  In addition to other qualifications Miss  Verjuice  was a  politician    Unnatural  war said the Captain repeating the word  unnatural  with marked emphasis Madam it is not possible that a war by which so many men get their livelihood can be  unnatural    Nor the  instruments  of the war neither I suppose replied Miss  Verjuice  you Captain took a very natural part in the last war sighting against you king and against your countryThis was the shot of an invenomed arrow but integrity which sat upon the Captain's heart repelled ithe saw the malignity of the intention and warmed with an honest ardour not to  resent  the injury but to  defend  his honour  I fought for  bread  and for  reputation  Madam answered the Captainthe laws of my country deprived me of my inheritance but they could not humble my spiritborn a gentleman I scorned to degenerate into any other characterA passion for same said  Maria  is the instinct of all great soulsI bowed to  Maria  she construed my bow into an approbation of her sentiment but it was in fact a bow of gratitude for the compliment she paid my countryman  The Captain went onI sought for  bread  I fought for  reputation  and the instant I  could acquire  bread  and  reputation  under the government of my own country I returned to her bosom returned with as ardent affection heaven knows as ever lover returned with to the bosom of his mistressMiss  Verjuice  for an instant  relaxed  her muscles But while government precluded me from going to heaven by the road which the souls of my ancestors had travelled I could not fight for that government with zeal even if she had accepted my serviceMiss  Verjuice  again  braced  up her musclesand you thought purgatory said Miss  Verjuice  the high road to heaven and gave up your  estate  in  this  world sooner than you would subscribe to the  geography  of the  other  world as laid down by the lawDo you not think it strange Sir continued this amiable virgin turning her  eye  upon me that a man bred to the  sword  and who has been spreading  desolation  over the face of the earth should have so  tender  a  conscience    I would have answered the ladybut there was no stopping the tide of the Captain's  volubility his face glowed scarlethis eyes darted lightninghe rose from his chair and throwing himself into the attitude of a  Cicero  addressed Miss  Verjuice  You are a woman Madamand do not understand the duty of a soldier nor the honourable purposes of war The duty of a soldier Madam is to support justice and do injury to no manto maintain truth and aid virtueand let me tell you Madam that to repress the wild fury of lawless invaders and by force to extirpate wickedness and oppression from the face of the earth has never been accounted violence or spreading desolation in any country or languageRobbers may be subdued by force or death if other means fail Those who invade private property may be compelled to restitution at the bar of justice But if independant states have injured us to what bar shall we cite them who shall constrain them to appear at our summons or if they should appear who shall oblige them to abide by our sentenceopen force then must be the dernier resort and who will be  base or mean enough to say that under such circumstances war is not just  You are so eloquent and energetic in your eloquence Captain said Miss  Verjuice  that it is really a pity you are not in the house to aid the phalanx of  speaking  admirals and generals  The Captain had spent many years in France he took the compliment  literally  bowed in return and laying his hand upon his heart swore he would prefer serving his country in the field  Miss  Verjuice  would have replied but the Captain had not exhausted his oratory  The enemies of GreatBritain and Ireland vociferated the Captain have in the present war acted with treachery and should be punished let every soldier raising his hand as if to stimulate the rankslet every soldier raise in himself a noble manly enthusiasm  you  fight in the cause of virtue justice and freedom no one is going to fight said Miss  Verjuice  but the Captain was not to be interrupted he galloped onanimated by this  divine principle what wonders have not Britons performed how have they risen terrors of the earth the protectors of the oppressed the avengers of justice and scourge of tyrants how have the sons of rapine sunk before them confounded and overthrown Witness ye  Danube  and  Sombre  crimsoned with bloodlet France let Spain Germany and both the Indies bear witnessWhat was it fired British kings and generalsAlfred WilliamHenryGeorge Marlborough GranbyCumberlandWolfe and Ligonier I will tell you said Miss  Verjuice  it was the justice of their cause and an unconquerable passion for liberty  This unexpected stroke of anticipation  cut down  the Captainhe suddenly fell back in his chair  Miss  Verjuice  could not bear to lose the advantage of her  cut  she followed her blow there was a loud  explosion  in your fire Captain said Miss  Verjuice  but the charge was  government powder    I felt for the Captain so changed the subject There are but few of our countrymen now said I in foreign serviceI know but of two answered the Captain  O'Ricly  who is in the service of  Spain  and  O'Dunn  who is in the service of  France    Do you mean the Sieur  O'Ricly  said Miss  Verjuice  who went ambassador from  Madrid  to  Paris  I do Madam answered the Captain and Count  O'Dunn  who was dispatched from  Paris  to negociate with the Queen of  Portugal  on the armed neutrality  There were accounts of those negotiations I believe said  Maria  published in the prints True Madam said the Captain I was present at  O'Riely  's interview with the French king and went with  O'Dunn  into Portugal from whence I came to LondonIt was I wrote and sent the accounts to the  Public Ledger  under the head  Extract of a Letter from Paris  I have both  It is very probable this extract of a letter from Paris is as authentic as most extracts from foreign letters arethe majority of which are written in London  about me  and if you please ladies to hear them the young gentleman pointing to me will be kind enough to read for your amusement  The ladies thanked the Captainhe took the papers from his pockets and handing them to me I read  THE SIEUR O'RIELY'S NEGOTIATION  THE most  extraordinary  intelligence that ever was published within the walls of Paris or ever set the spirits of Frenchmen upon the wing has been published within these few days  The victories of Edward and Henry of England did not astonish the French nation so much nor did the conquests of Lewis the XIVth give the French people half the satisfaction as they received from the capture of the English merchantmen It was as novel as it was unexpected  Half the people in France will be ruined by the expence of rejoicingsevery house was  open all the bells were ringingmen women and children of all denominations trades and professions danc'd caper'd jigg'd it and skip'd about with the agility of Benivento's devils What with fireworks and illuminations bonfires and transparent paintings rockets squibs and crackers discharges from the artillery  feus de joye  from the small arms and huzzaing from the mob not only the city of Paris but the whole country round looked and sounded like hell itselfAll was fire and clatter  te Deums  in every church  The court was met upon the occasion of the glad tidings when a  Grandee of Spain  whiskered up to the eyebrowsgloved up to the elbowscuffed up to the arms booted up to the hips with a coat which fell short of his hams a waistcoat that reached to his knees and spurred upon each heel like a gamecock arrived express from Madrid with a letter congratulatory from his most  Catholic  Majesty  The Grandee wore a thundering black perriwig bushy at the sides with a ramillie  tail down to his crupper and had belted round his waist a basket toledo in the hilt of which was deposited his handkerchief  The Grandee of Spain was announced to the court by the Gentleman Usher as the  Sieur O'Riely  The Sieur  O'Riely  entered the instant his name was announced the most  Christian  King having just time to take his thronethe Queen seating herself by him The most Christian King arose to receive the  Sieur  the Queen turned to her favourite maid of honour  Lucetta    This Grandee must be  Irish  observed the Queen by the great O' he carries before his name It is true said  Lucetta  for your Majesty may remember most of the brigade officers who are returned to  Ireland  had great O' before their names  Since the laws against papists have been relaxed in Ireland several gentlemen who were in foreign services have returned to their native country    I remember it well answered the Queen blushing  Her Majesty laying the back of her right hand convexed into the palm of her left which she had concaved for the purpose and resting her elbows upon her hips with great ease dropped both hands uponthe Queen's hands fell just over that spot where in the picture of Venus the golden clasp unites the argent zone of the GoddessThe Queen courtesying to the ground with the most amiable humility while her eyes darted beams more penetrating than the rays of Apollo her hands still keeping their positionsaid to the Sieur  O'Riely"Noble Sir your are welcome to these parts"    The whole court was astonished at her Majesty's condescension  The Sieur  O'Riely  was overwhelmed with her goodness even to confusion  Bowing to the ground with profound respect and drawing back his right leg he thurst his spur into that part of the Gentlemanusher's ancle where the articulation unites the leg to the footThe electrified Gentlemanusher sprung from the ground  with a  sacra Dieu  and forgetting the presence he was in laid his hand upon his sword The Sieur  O'Riely  turning round his head looked the Gentlemanusher full in the face and curling up his mustachios over his nostrils muttered something in a language neither English Irish French nor Spanish it partook of each language"he grinned horribly a ghastly smile"The Gentlemanusher felt the full force of the Gorgon grin he stood petrifiedThe whole court laughed The Sieur  O'Riely  took a pinch of snuff he took it from his coatpocket where he always kept it loose  The Sieur  O'Riely  falling upon his left knee rivetted his eyes upon the eyes of the Queen of FranceI have got it here said  O'Riely  thursting his hand into his breeches pocketsI have got that here to present to your Majesty the like of which was never seen in France in Spain nor in any other country on the continentThe Queen of France  Lucetta  her favourite the maids of honour and all the other ladies of the court  smiled while their eyes followed the hand of the  Sieur  into his breechespocketa thousand ideas struck their imagination  I have it here exclaimed the  Sieur  with an exulting voice as he drew from his breeches pocket  a long roll  It was a roll of parchment on which was written "a list of the  English merchantmen  taken by the fleets of France and Spain"  The Sieur  O'Riely  was rightFrance nor Spain nor no country in the universe ever before saw such a sight  The French King had read about one quarter of the list when a nobleman rushed in out of breathEagerness and astonishment were in his countenanceThe  Belle Poule  said the nobleman is takenEngland must become bankrupt exclaimed the French KingThe captain officers and one half of the seamen said the nobleman are killedLord have mercy on their souls ejaculated the French Kingbut  we have taken the English convoy  Amen added a bishop nodding half a sleep in a chair  we  have taken the English convoy  Let masses be said for the killed said the Queen  we have taken the English convoy  not till thanksgiving is sung for the victory said Monsieur  Sartine we have taken the English convoy  The  Belle Poule  the captain the officers and the seamen were immediately forgotten by the court of France  they had taken the English convoy  The French King had read through half the list when another nobleman came in The Duke  d'Artois  is gone said the nobleman with a melancholy voiceThen we have lost the patron of fashion said the Gentlemenusher looking down upon his enormous buckles with a sighYou must conceal the Duke's death said the French King till the rejoicings are over  we have taken the English convoy  If half the princes of the blood were dead I would not mourn nor wear mourning this month  for we have taken the English convoy    Vive le Roi  exclaimed the nobleman but alas letting his voice fall into a sorrowful  piano  it is the  Artois ship of war  carrying sixtyfour guns and seven hundred men that is goneGood heaven said the Queen the  Artois  was commanded by an  Irishman  and was taken by an  Irishman  an't please your Majesty answered the nobleman  The Artois was commanded by the Count  d'Clonard  and taken by Captain  Mac Bride  When  Greek  meets  Greek  then comes the tug of war said  O'Riely  These Irishmen  Lucetta  whispered the Queen of France are always  standing  in our waythat is our own fault an't please your Majesty answered  Lucetta  Was their force equal interrogated the French KingPretty equal answered the noblemanBy no means said  O'Riely  turning to an Irish officer who stood behind him  Clonard  fought against his king and countrydisloyalty weighed him down and the reproach of being a parracide weakened his heartMerciful heaven that zeal should so long have blinded England and my  native land  Persecution  was consumed in a  fire  of her own kindling in the month of June  LG GRN  as to force her subjects to fight against her  Big tears stood in the eye of the Sieur  O'Riely  for an instantthey rolled down the surrows of his sunburnt cheekhe took his handkerchief from the hilt of his sword to wipe those tears away which his countryman perceiving he clasped the veteran in his arms and received the tears upon his faithful bosom  Here ended the Letter from Paris  Maria  had dropped a sympathetic tear with  O'Riely  Miss  Verjuice  had swelled but the fountain of humanity was dried withinnot a tear fellYou have taken no small pains Captain said Miss  Verjuice  to blazon the virtue and courage of your own countrymen attend to the next letter said the Captain and you shall acknowledge I have not been partial So saying the Captain put another paper in my hand and I read  O'RIELY AND SARTINE  THE court having broken up Monsieur  Sartine  conducted the Sieur  O'Riely  from the royal palace to his own house  Dinner being ended and the attendants ordered to retire  Sartine  filled a rummer glass with Burgundy and taking the  Sieur  by the handyou Islanders said  Sartine  drink deepcome you must fill to my toastI am going to give  the land we live in  The  Sieur  seizing the decanter in his right hand and a rummer glass in his left turned up his eyes to heaven with a look of ardent zeal approaching devotionhe heaved a heavy sigh from the bottom of his deep chest expressive of his feeling and pouring the libation of Burgundy into his rummer till it overflowed the brim and rising from his chair his eye still turned up to heaven he  articulated in an expression of grief mingled with pleasure  The British dominions    Sartine  smiled at what he supposed a mistake of his guest  You are an  Irishman  said  Sartine  and have privilege to fall into errors without giving offenceI excuse you my friend but I meant by my toast the dominions of the  grand monarque  Then answered  O'Riely  you should have saidthe land we  breathe  inthere is no  living  any where but under a free government I have considered myself as dying of a consumption ever since I left my native climate so  here she goes  and pouring more wine upon the liquor which already overflowed his rummer  here she goes  repeated  O'Riely  with an  oath    It is a  bumper toast  said  Sartine  and should have preceded all others filling at the same time the rummer he had emptied to the dominions of the  grand monarque  It is a bumper toast by heaven said  O'Riely  and the world must give way to heronly  half  of  the world said  Sartine  She is the mother of the islands continued  O'Riely  she is the sovereign mistress of the seaI love her as I love the blood of my heartmy toast is  Old England    Monsieur  Sartine  was struck dumbhe sipped part of his Burgundy  This  victory  of ours said  Sartine  recovering from his surprize as  O'Riely  recovered from his agitation this victory of ours is glorious What victory enquired his guest Have we not taken the  English convoy  said  Sartine  We may say with  Caesar Veni vidi vici  Yes you may say that said  O'Riely  you came you saw you conquer'd but I cannot see much honour in the affair nor much courage nor any great national advantage The devil a sword was drawn nor the devil a gun was fired and when the cargoes are divided between France and Spain where will be the advantage  Let me tell you Monsieur  Sartine  this glorious victory gained without fighting or bloodshed will cost France and Spain more  ships more men more money and more reputation than a thousand times the value of the ships they have taken  Englishmen are as delicate of the character of their  courage  as English women are of the reputation of their  chastity    Take my word for it Monsieur  Sartine  a short time will shew you same of those laconic English Gazetteepistles that say "the enemies ships are all taken sunk burned and destroyed as per margin"  The times are altered said  Sartine  I grant such accounts have formerly appeared but in our late engagements with the English we have fought like devils incarnate  You have done wonders no doubt answered the  Hibernian  but if your men have fought like  devils  how must these men have fought who cut your devils to piecesthey must have fought like  angels  at leastThe courage of the  English  is natural it is inherent to the soiltheir dogs their horses their game cocks are constitutionally brave  send them to  France  and they degenerate It is the same with their  men  It is true indeed and pity it is 'tis true that what with taking the  grand tour  and being upon terms of  familiarity  at home with the base  outcasts  of foreign nations the dancing fiddling skipping tribe of the operahouse many of our young fellows of fashion have sunk from their natural spirit and the dignity of  manhood    EDD OSW    Monsieur  Sartine  pulled out his watchit is time said  Sartine  we should attend the drawingroomHe ordered his carriage and taking  O'Riely  with him drove for the palace  O'RIELY AT THE DRAWINGROOM THE RUMP OF BEEF  WHEN  O'Riely  arrived at the drawingroom he was joined by his countryman in the French servicedescription is inadequate said  O'Riely  's countryman the tongue of man cannot communicate a proper idea of the vanity the pride the presumption of this volatile nationfrom the meanest peasant up to the grand  monarque  they are jigging it over the whole country  The court is in an uproarall the foreign ministers all the nobles and all the wives sons and daughters of the nobles and foreign ministers have been invited to partake of the English and Irish beef taken on board the Quebec fleeta large  rump  has been sent to  Paris as a specimen this  rump  was intended for the king's table but not a pot in his majesty's kitchen was large enough to boil it The chief cook has made his fortune by shewing it at a  dernier  per head There never was such a  rump  seen in France  The magnitude of this  rump  had set all the court ladies of France calculatingthey thought of nothing but the  rump  the  rump  was still uppermost in their thoughts and at their tongues endsThe queen of France intending to enquire after the king's  health  enquired after his majesty's  rumpLucetta  missed her little lapdoghas any one seen it said  Lucetta  there never was so pretty a thingseen what asked Monsieur  Sartine  my little  rump  answered  Lucetta  a bee stung one of the maids of honour on the  cheek  I am stungI am stungroared the maid of honourwherewhere enquired the king's physicianhere here here on my  rump  said the maid of honourthen I cannot extract the sting in this place replied the physician  The magnitude of this  rump  had set all the court ladies of France calculatingthe height of the great statue of Jupiter was calculated from his thumb as bearing a proportion to its other parts The stature of the antideluvian giants was calculated from their hipbones found in Sicily and the size of the deer formerly in Ireland has been calculated from the dimensions of their horns found in the bogsThe French ladies had better materials for calculating than a  thumb  a  hipbone  or a deer's  antler  They calculated from the  rump    An English ox said  Lucetta  has I suppose a  rump  as large again as an Englishmanand so by a simple rule of division she measured the limbs of the English prisoners expected at Paris  Lucetta  first measured their  rumps  in her imagination and thereby  hangs a tail    Lucetta  whispered in the Queen's ear when she had formed her calulationyou are right said the Queen to  Lucetta  that must be the  length  for that is just  half  the length of an English  oxe's horn  we have no such  horns  in  France said  Lucetta  true but many  English  gentlemen have  French horns  answered the Queen  Count  d'Guines  when ambassador from France to England introduced  French horns  into several noble families  C  but I wish the English prisoners were in ParisHeavens what  horning  and  butting  would be then  Now the English  rump  of beef was such a curiosity in Paris that the French king had it modelled in  cork  I will try how it fits said the Queen of France to  Lucetta  Lucetta fixed the  corkrump  upon the Queen the Queen would never part with it so  Lucetta  and all the ladies of the French court got  corkrumps  in compliment to her majesty  A DRAWINGROOM CONVERSATION  NEVER was drawingroom in Paris so crowded as this drawingroomall orders of people were admitted tag rag and bobtail poured in and as they poured in they poured out their congratulations to the French King on capturing the Quebec fleet  Vive le Roi  was the general cry  There was not half so much rejoicing in England last war when not only Quebec itself but all Canada was taken from France by the British arms  I always give my opinion openly when it is demanded said the Sieur  O'Riely  bowing  respectfully and answering the KingI was born in a land of liberty and sucked in freedom with the first respirations of life Your majesty commands my opinion you shall have an honest one  The English have lost their Quebec fleet a heavy loss to them no doubt but no acquisition of glory to France or to Spain they had no convoy to fight for themnot a gun firednot a sword drawn  Should the grand fleets of each nation meet then there will be fighting worth speaking of These English are a people who will march up as cool to the mouth of a charged canon as they march up to their bed  To their bed said  Lucetta  to herself march up  coolly  to their bedthe Sieur must be speaking of  batchelors  I suppose whispered  Lucetta  to the QueenHeaven preserve me from a husband who would march  coolly  to bed  How did they behave against Caesar against the DanesHow at Cressyat  at Poictiersat Agincourt continued the Sieur  O'Riely    They fought at Agincourt without their  breeches  said a merry bishop as he rubbed down his sleek and rubied dewlap  At the battle of Agincourt the English were so ill with a violent dysentery they were obliged to fight uncovered in the rear    Mercy preserve usejaculated the Queen  It must have been a strange sight said  Lucetta    And I swear by my  bishoprick  continued the reverend fatherand there is not a better bishoprick in France had but one company of  Amazons  been in the pay of France that day the  unbreeched  English would never have carried a  standard  from the field  It was a  dirty  affair said the Kingto  France  said  O'Riely  but why did you not open the  nunneries  the  nuns  would have done the business as effectually as the Amazons confinement gives ferocity to passionthe  nuns  would have played the devil in the ranks there would have been no standing before them for five minuteswhat says your reverence  You are mistaken replied the bishop the holy motherchurch takes special care that all women under tuition of its  members  shall be properly  disciplined  Though nunneries are  hotbeds  yet the  nuns  who may be said to  vegetate  in these beds are  cool  as  cucumbers    As I am a Christian ruminated  Lucetta  to herselfhad I known that  nuns  led such chaste and holy livesI should have taken the veil long sinceI should have flourished in one of these  hotbeds  like a  sensitive plant    The Sieur  O'Riely  went on  Let us continued the Sieur look to more modern times The astonishing victories of Marlborough which exceed any victories antiquity can boastto these succeed Dettingen Mindenhold said Monsieur  Sartine  interrupting the  Sieur  you have forgotten or  slipped over Fountenoy where the English run  Not so by heaven said  O'Riely  stretching forth his hand and rolling an enthusiastic eye I have not forgotten Fountenoy nor the famous battle of the  Spurs  where the French cavalry galloped off in whole squadronsthe English run at Fountenoy yes they run up to the muzzles of your musquets while you were intrenched chindeep in earth and mowing down whole columns from your masked batteriesbut notwithstanding the whole power of France your  gen d'arms  and your select infantry the English would never have stopped running till they had run into your trenches and forced you to run out but for your auxiliaries they never stood till the Irish brigades appeared before them and then they stood shocked to see the subjects of their own climate the children of their own constitution standing armed to oppose them in the field the brigades changed the face of the battle they fought for a point of honour and would  not flinch The English had the same point of honour to maintain and each fought without losing an inch of ground till the slaughter on both sides made it necessary for each side to retreatthe French looking on  After this good Monsieur  Sartine  continued  O'Riely  will you pretend to say that at Fountenoy even England retreated before France  Monsieur  Sartine  stood dumb  This too was the day when the late glorious immortal Cumberland rebellion's curse and freedom's friend exclaimed against the wretched policy of his country which forced so many of her subjects to fight against her for the wretched pay and precarious sustenance of France  O may the hero ever live the blessing and the honour of his country  The whole court laughed at the Sieur  O'Riley  's blunderthey took it for an error of his  head  whereas it was an overflowing of his  heart  he was grateful to Cumberland for his  opinion  When the Duke of Cumberland saw the stand made by the Irish brigades he cursed with great bitterness the policy which had forced them into a foreign service There was a regiment of Irish horse in the service of England that day commanded by Lord Ligonier which stood till almost cut to pieces  the bishop took him up upon it the Duke of Cumberland said the bishop has been dead some yearswe have not heard of his resurrection  O'Riely  gave a heavy sigh and with a smile of ineffable contempt retorted upon the holy fathernot one of all the saints said  O'Riley  that ever Monkish superstition canonized in your rubrick lives in such glory as the heroCumberland the brave the generous and good  lives  in the hearts of a free people and will live in their hearts till memory is no moreand history is obliterated which of the commanders of your army of martyrs can you say so much  The French King mortified at the spirit and manner in which the brave old Hibernian had delivered his sentiments left the drawingroom  in disgustthe bishop followed his majesty gnawing his under lip he felt for the army of martyrsand Monsieur  Sartine  skipped after with remarkable agility Monsieur  Sartine  felt for himself  The Queen remained behind which  O'Riely  perceiving stepped in between her majesty and the gentleman usher who instantly stepped aside and offering his hand with an obsequious bow her majesty accepted it with an ineffable smile of good humour and condescension Every courtier's heart grew black with envy  Lucetta  and the maids of honour brought up the rear with their eyes fixed upon  O'Riely  's back he is at least half the size of an ox said  Lucetta  what a  rump  said the maids of honourand what a  Ramillietail  said  Lucetta  the maids of honour repeated the observation it flew into the antichamber where it was echoed by the court ladiesthe other attendants reechoed it in the upper storiesit got down stairs and returned up  stairs verberated and reverberated from room to room from the garret to the coalhole  Having finished the Sieur  O'Riely  's interview with their French majesties and returned the paper to the Captain Miss  Verjuice  opened her mouth a mouth which never opened but like Pandora'sbox it emitted a collection of evilsHappily for the Captain in the very instant she was going to give a full discharge of acrimonious sarcasm the servant brought in a note which she informed us required her immediate attendance on a neighbouring lady who was seized with labour  Miss  Verjuice  though a  virgin  had the experience of an  acoucheur  she had read anatomy and was often called in to assist being remarkable for her  philosophical  conduct which enabled her to stand  unmoved  when even the midwife has been found so  weakhearted  as to leave her patient to natureBut if Miss  Verjuice  did not possess humanity she possessed the affectation of humanity in the fullest extent for as her virtue consisted in her severity  upon the vicious so her humanity consisted in a severe abuse upon the uncharitable She was a theorist in both but had never entered into the practice of either Not but Miss  Verjuice  had passionsbut she had never been led into temptation  Miss  Verjuice  was punctual to every call of every sick or unfortunate acquaintance who stood in need of  no  pecuniary assistance no lady could mourn with a more deplorable countenance or sought the house of sorrow with more sedulity than Miss  Verjuice  if verbal consolation only was requiredyet such was the tenderness of her feelings that if  want  attended sickness or misfortune she could not bear to look upon accumulated distress and therefore the poor man's door she was never known to enter  Punctual in attending church and regular in paying the poorrates it might be said that she was religious and bountiful  according to law  She practised all the externals of morality without morals and  performed the rituals of devotions without piety  I have been particular in describing this  virgin  and her attributes as she will hereafter cut a very conspicuous figure in these excursions It is true my intention is to shew human nature in its amiable light but to do this with any degree of perfection I must be allowed a dark ground and strong shades many will doubt that such a character exists but let them go toNo let them live in doubt still and may they never receive conviction from experience  THE AUTHOR    Miss Verjuice notwithstanding an affectation of hurry entered into a dissertation upon the necessity of assisting our fellowcreature in distress but  Maria  observing that perhaps her friend might be impatient to see hershe made an apology I returned to the parlour with  Maria  attended by the Captain and soon after saw Miss  Verjuice  sally forth equipt in her nightdress  The Captain proposed a walk to which proposal Maria and I acquiescing we proceeded to the bank of the Thames and finding  a convenient spot close to a thicket sat down to enjoy the beauty of the prospect and the eveningair which being gently agitated by a cooling fragrant breeze pleased and revived the senses  THE BIRD'S NEST  A THRUSH sat perched upon the spray of an old thorn he kept turning and looking to every quarter with evident anxious expectation but being soon joined by his mate who bore food in her mouth his joy became conspicuous as his anxiety had been and he expressed it to his companion in a thousand endearing salutations and offices of lovethe hen popped into the thicket to feed her young while the cock turning up his head towards heaven in grateful thanks to his Creator for the providential sustenance of his little family poured forth the joyful thanks of his heart in melodious song  But happiness is not the lot of mortal beings from the most insignificant insect up to the great lord of the creation man every animal has its misfortunesits miseriesall are the sports of contingencies  Two boys stole along the thicketthe poor thrush upon the spray instantly stopt his melody he boys had discovered his nest and before I could prevent the depredation for I arose for the purpose had torn it from the thicket with its infant inhabitants The hen had escaped and joined the matethe boys carried off their prey the old birds calling in notes of distressthe boys disappeared hope disappeared with themthe unhappy parents sat silent close to each other for a few minutes when as if urged by a mutual despair they took wing together and flew from the scene of their wretchedness  There is something said the Captain truly distressing in the exhibition of domestic woe just presented to usand should I detect a son of mine in the commission of such a robbery as the two little rascals have committed I would punish them as severely as for robbing the church  Why in truth said Maria it is a species of sacrilegechildren should be taught to abhor it to impress the precepts of humanity  upon the minds of infants is the first the most essential duty of parentsit prepares the heart for all the tender offices of life and opens the soul to receive the lights of morality and religion  I must pay this tribute to your sentiment said the Captain seizing  Maria  's handpressing it to his breasthe raised it to his lips and kissed itbut with such chastity of devotion as the professed religious kiss the shrines of their patron saintsA tear had fallen from his eye upon  Maria  's hand she would have wiped it away with her handkerchief but while viewing it with admiration her heart bleeding with sympathy a beam darted from the eveningsun and exhaled the tear to the upper heaven where it is now preserved upon the altar of  grace  an evidence of human benignity  It is our duty said the Captain to use all animals with mercythey have life they have sense they have gratitudethose of a domestic nature are most of them endowed with affection and tenderness to their protectors  while others possess properties which make us the most beneficial returnswe owe justice to men but grace and goodness to brutes  But said I adverting to the plunder of the poor thrush there is a happiness peculiar to subordinate animals of every species their parental tenderness is but temporary and their grief on losing their offspring though it may be severe while it lasts lasts but a short time whereas with the human species such misfortunes produce permanent griefoften terminate in death  SLAVE TRADE  MERCIFUL heaven exclaimed the Captainwhen we reflect upon the plunder of the human species carried on by nations calling themselves christian professing the divine maxim "do as you would be done by" boasting the benign principles of humanity and enlightened by the sublime rays of holy revelation it sinks us in my opinion infinitely below the most ferocious beasts of prey for none of these live by the slaughter and calamities of their own kind  I perceive said I you are execrating the conduct of Europeans to the unhappy children of AfricaI have often reflected upon our cruelty to those people first in carrying them from their native country and then exercising upon them every cruelty that can  debase human nature or render life miserable  There is but one way of accounting for this cruelty said Maria and  Sterne  has hit upon it "the poor  Negroes  have no one to stand up for them"  They are sacrifices to COMMERCE said I  You mean to AVARICE said the Captain COMMERCE is a mild deity and never requires human victims to bleed upon her altar  The fruits of industry and the fruits of the earth are her offerings Commerce is a cure for the most destructive prejudices where we find agreeable manners there commerce flourishes and wherever there is commerce there we meet agreeable manners So says Montesquieu  Commercical laws said I arguing from the same author improve manners but they improve manners from the same reason they destroy themthey corrupt the purest morals polish and refine the most barbarous The spirit of trade produces in the mind of man a certain sense of exact justice but does it  not produce sanguinary laws and rage of avarice that overleaps all bound of justice and tramples upon humanity The total deprivation of trade produces robberybut is not hospitality most rare in trading countries and is it not found in perfection among nations of vagabonds Among the ancient Germans to shut a door against a stranger would be considered as sacrilege  I shall not take upon me said Maria to determine how far such nations may merit the opprobrious term you have given them but I should rather live and die among such a people than among the most refined and I think this hospitality which must necessarily include in it an assiduity to please is a convincing proof of the excellency of the human heart in a simple stateWhat have we got by our boasted improvements and frivilous politeness but the loss of manly firmness and independence  I could write a very long note upon this  ED OSW    The Captain looked at Maria with astonishment and seizing her hand with a degree of rapture exclaimed you are rightyou are right my girl Avarice sensuality and every species of meanness have succeeded to generosity and honour and faction and servitude with bellowing on one side and adulation on the other are storming and undermining the asylum of libertyalmost every man wears the mask of hypocrisythe noble frankness which marked the character of Englishmen has dwindled into an affectation of sentiment and in assuming susceptibility of too refined feelings from feeling like men we have adopted the manners of womenEven philosophy participates the refinement of modern manners she forgets her chaste and simple charactershe forgets that she once inhabited the lonely cot of Socrates and shared the frugal fare of Epaminondas Then your legislators and generalsShew me a modern senator or commander who will descend from the seat of magistracy or  car of triumph and cultivate the land which his voice enacted laws to rule or which he defended with his blood  But to advert to the subject we were on continued the Captain every man who possesses humanity can vindicate the rights of humanity in his own breast but few men who feel the force of these rights have ability to defend themWhen a benevolent mind contemplates the ravages with which avarice has depopulated whole regions of the earth the soul shudders with horrorBut when we see the unhappy NEGRO seduced by the wiles of European dissimulation or dragged by treachery and force from his native liberty relations friendsperhaps the partner of his heart and pledges of his lovethen indeed the soul revolts and execrates the  villain  and the infamous  policy  which  protects  the villain who to indulge his  avarice  by providing for the sensuality of others tramples upon natural rights and forces into the vile  regions of servitude men born free as himself  It is really astonishing that in the dependencies of GreatBritain  slavery  should be permitted The court of  King'sBench  in the celebrated  negro cause  laid it down as a  principle  of the English constitution that slavery could not exist in this country and that the instant a  negro  set his foot on shore he was free Surely the  principles  of the constitution are immutable and rule in all the dependencies of GreatBritain though the  local  laws do not and therefore  slavery  cannot constitutionally exist in the dependencies  FHRVE    I have served in South America continued the CaptainI have conversed with the slaves and have sound among them men as capable of generous sentiment and of as noble soul as ever distinguished the character of a white Good heavens my heart sinks when recollection presents to my imagination the misery of these unfortunate fellowcreatures to whom death alone can give enfranchisement  Here the Captain stoppedhe was too full to proceed  As we are convinced said  Maria  from our own feelings that our hearts naturally incline us to relieve misery and our reason approves it as rightwhen we consider that providence has infused humanity into our breasts and has taught us to look to him as an example of mercy it is astonishing that pity and the divine pleasure which results from doing good should be so far exterminated from mankind  Cruelties said the Captain which no tongue can describe which no heart can conceive but from the evidence of the eyes are inflicted upon  negroes  The American and WestIndian newspapers may give a slight idea of the deplorable situation of these unhappy creatures In these papers they are advertised as  negro fellows  or  negro wenches  often described as bearing their tyrannic master's  brand  upon their  cheek  having a  padlocked yoke  about their  neck  or carrying the marks of merciless  stripes  upon their  skin  I have seen them roused by the  lash  to their labourdrove into stalls in herds like brutes and fed worse than those  dogs which are kept for the purpose of  hunting  them when they attempt to escape then in their old age they are turned out to povertyand they are denied  baptism  from an apprehension it would make them insolen  Pray said  Maria  addressing the Captain are there any  clergymen  in those countries  Every parish has its  pastor  answered the Captain and every  pastor  is a  planter  and keeps unbaptized slaves  Lord have mercy upon their souls said Maria  On whose souls asked the Captain  On the souls of those planters answered Maria  Do you mean said the Captain the  planters  of  Christianity  if you do    This  blot  seems to be the very reverse of the blot which the recording angel dropped upon my uncle  Toby  's oath  LAURENCE STERNE  and indeed the planters of tobacco do not appear in a much better predicament  The Captain would have proceeded but perceiving Maria was in tears he immediately stopt  He would have added no doubt that at the death of a planter the  negroes  are sold by auction fathers separated from their children and their wives that a  white man  may beat a  black man  with impunity or debauch his wife or daughterthat he may  murder  him upon paying his  value and  that it is  death  for a black to strike a  white  and so it should be  A PLANTER  He had a soul brave as Achilles had a heart melting as infant tenderness  We will change the conversation said the CaptainHere my lad said he handing a paper here is the account I published of Count O'DUNN  I took the paper and read  COUNT O'DUNN'S NEGOTIATION WITH THE QUEEN OF PORTUGAL  COUNT O'DUNN'S APPOINTMENT  IF her majesty of Portugal could be prevailed upon to join the armed neutrality said the grand monarque England must submit her flag would no longer proudly fly with usurped authority upon the narrow seas the thunder of her cannon would no longer with sovereign arrogance command the ships of other independent states to lower their topsails What is to be done  Sartine    Nothing can be done answered Monsieur  Sartine  our most able and subtil negotiators have failed in their negotiations with the Queen of Portugal  Count  O'Dunn  who had been employed last war as plenipotentiary to the court of Lisbon was standing at the French King's elbow  Our most able and subtle negotiators have failed repeated Monsieur  Sartine    They were Frenchmen said Count  O'Dunn  to himself  The Queen of Portugal is as impenetrable as flint said Monsieur  Sartine    To French negotiators said Count  O'Dunn  to himself  You have been in Portugal  O'Dunn  said the French Kingwith a wink which implied "you have seen  Pharsalia  " but  mum  what think you of the Queen is she that soul of marble  Sartine  represents her Is there no getting at her heart  She is a woman may it please your majesty answered  O'Dunn  and I know but of one way by which her heart can be approached  The Count has been a man of gallantry in his time observed the French Queenno  man at court has the character of getting  nearer  a lady's  heart  than the Count  Three ladies  sighed  in confirmation of what her majesty said  Then he is the very man to do  business  with the Queen of Portugal said Monsieur  Sartine  The Count  O'Dunn  was immediately invested with full powers to negotiate with the Queen of PortugalThe Count depended but little however upon his  paper  instructions though an old man his chief dependence was upon his  abilities  then he had  experience  and  experience  is half the  battle  he knew it was a Lady he had to deal with and no man breathing knew  better  how to deal with a Lady  O'DUNN'S ARRIVAL AT LISBON  SOON as the Count  O'Dunn  arrived at Lisbon he dispatched his secretary to courtthe Lady in waiting informed the Queen of Portugalthe Count was desired to attend in the antichamberhe was announced he appeared and the instant he appeared every woman in the room ejaculated the first letter of his name with a note of admiration annexedO O O O O went round the roomO was the only sound for two minutes  The Ladies of the court dissected Count  O'Dunn  as Ladies of the court always dissect strangers on their first appearanceone praised his legs another praised his shoulders a third praised his eyesbut the old Dutchess  of Bwas actually smitten with him on account of his  forefinger    As the Count had crossed one of the private courtyards unfortunate for the old Dutchess of B he had occasion to drawoff his  glove  the old Dutchess of Bwas at that instant peeping at the Count through a lattice with her  magnifying  glass and the  forefinger  of the Count hit exactly upon her grace's  focus  Her grace could not avoid gazing on the Count's  forefinger    The Count wore  two brilliants  on his  forefinger  they were  family jewels  the Count's  father  had given them to his  mother  his  mother  had given them to himthey rivetted the eyes of the old Dutchess of Bwith as fascinating a power as if she had gazed upon a  rattlesnake    The old Dutchess was experienced in the value of  brilliants  and the instant she perceived those on the Count's  forefinger  her grace exclaimed never did I see such a  finger  never did I see such  brilliants  they are only fit for a Queen  The Dutchess of B was avaricious therefore the instant the idea of the Queen came across her grace she concluded that if these  brilliants  which garnished Count  O'Dunn  's forefinger could be procured for her Majesty of Portugalher own fortune was made  Little did the Dutchess of B think that by this determination she would serve not only the Queen of Portugal but the armed neutrality of Europe  Some say that the Count having perceived the old Dutchess of Bspeculating through the lattice and knowing her to be in the Queen's confidence he drew off his glove on purpose but whether he did or did not whether the action was  accidental  or  manoeuvre  it is certain that the Count  O'Dunn  got  into  the Queen's  confidence  by it  When the old Dutchess of B informed the Queen of Portugal of what she had seen her Portuguese Majesty smiledyou  must be mistaken my dear Dutchess said the Queen I never heard of so white so taper a  forefinger  nor of such  brilliants  as you have describedif they are so large they must be equal in value to the famous diamond worn by the Great Mogul and exceed that in the hat of the French Kingyou have been deceived by a false appearanceconsider my dear dear Dutchess you were looking thro' a  magnifying  glass  The Queen was right and the Queen was wrongthe Dutchess of B was right and the Dutchess of B was wrongthe old Dutchess was deceived not in the  magnitude  but in the quality of what she supposed to be  brilliants  they were nothing better than common  Irish diamonds  which are plenty in London and Paris  In Lisbon they had  novelty  to recommend them  We must keep up decorum said the Queen of Portugal to the Dutchess of B before we admit Count  O'Dunn  to our presence you must enquire into the nature of his business  The old Dutchess flew to the antichamber and put the question to the Count she found him incircled by the Ladies of the courtMy business said Count  O'Dunn  is with the Queen herselfand to the Queen herself  alone  will I impart my business  Then you will not  trust  me said the old Dutchess  By heaven I will not  trust  you my Lady Dutchess nor any other Lady in the court the court Ladies hung down their heads  I am keeper of the Queen's  secrets  said the old Dutchess of B  But you are not keeper of my  secrets  answered Count  O'Dunn  The old Dutchess fixing her eye upon the Count's  forefinger  took him by the hand and led him to the Queen's apartment  THE HEMSIGNAL  THE Dutchess had much at  stake  she had drawn a picture for the Queen and she knew the consequence if the original should fall  short  of the copy She had some doubts from what the Queen had started that her  magnifying  glass might have deceived her  I was once very much deceived in a scene of my own writing which depended upon the doctrine of  proportions  The figure of an  Hercules  cloathed was to have been exhibited in my comedy of the WORLD AS IT GOES  alias  SECOND THOUGHTS ARE BEST but the villainous propertyman had the fellow who represented the demigod put upon the pedestal as  naked  I intended the figure should have been  fully proportioned  in all its  parts  whereas a  narrowshouldered  man was chosenso that when the  femalevirtuoso  who was to have been rendered ridiculous by applying  disproportions  to a  proportioned  figure came to give her judgment the  satire  was  lost  the fellow who  played  the  statue  being actually in appearance  too  narrow  in the  thorax  to hold the  vital parts  and horridly  disproportioned  in the  foreshortening  of  one  of his  members  MCWY    Her fears however subsided upon her interview with the Count She viewed him without her glass and joy flushed her cheeks She measured him with her eyes as a female virtuoso measures the beautiful representations of  nature  in the galleries of Italy  The Dutchess of Bhad been a woman of remarkable  sensibility Sympathy  was her  weakness  In her youth she had found the highest satisfaction in  communicating  pleasure to others and her greatest pleasure now was in  procuring  it Yet no woman had ever given more  pain  than the Dutchess of B but then no woman had ever gone further than the Dutchess of B to  alleviate  the pain she had given  Man  never  kneeled  to her  grace  in vain nor petitioned her  grace  without relief  An old lady of  my  acquaintance is just such another merciful character  HRRN  Dowg    The Dutchess of B having approached the door of the royal closet gave a loud  hem  This hem informed the Queen of Portugal that Count  O'Dunn  was near  Her majesty of Portugal was at that instant standing before a great glass wrapped up in admiration of herself All Portugal admired the Queen of Portugal but no subject in Portugal admired the Queen of Portugal more than the Queen of Portugal admired herself  Yet the Queen was not vainshe knew the power of her charms from their  effects  upon mankind and the subject of her consideration now was to muster and draw out in amorous array their full force armed at all points against Count  O'Dunn    But the whole system of the Queen of Portugal's intended operations against the Count was overturned by the  hemsignal  of the Dutchess of B Every glance every leer every smile every giggle which  art  had armed for her assistance and long experience had exercised into discipline fled at the instant the  hemsignal  was given nor could the Queen with all her generalship rally them into ordernature had taken possession of their post and defied the powers of  art  to dislodge her  THE INTERVIEW  THE Queen of Portugal as many able commanders have done threw herself upon  chance  she sat upon a sophathe  door  of the closet  opened  the  eyes  of the Queen  shut    The complexion of the Queen of Portugal was a bright oliveCount  O'Dunn  never considered colourshe admired the whole sex every colour had its attraction for him he loved  woman  because she was  woman  and to this generous affection he bore to  woman  kind may be imputed a passion the most generous and disinterested which from his youth he had entertained for an individual  The Count made his obeisancethe Queen opened her eyesthe Count dropped the curtains of his eyesa dead silence ensued  The Dutchess of Bbroke silence she introduced the Count in form as plenipotentiary from the court of France and recollecting his declaration in refusing to communicate his business to any person but the Queen in  private  she retired as a woman of discretion shouldshut the doorfell upon her kneesand applied her eye close to the  keyhole    Had Count  O'Dunn  been before all the male crowned heads in Europe he would not have evinced diffidencehad Count  O'Dunn  been marching up against a battery he would not have betrayed fearyet the Count was silent and trembled before the Queen of Portugal  Pray Captain said Maria perceiving I rested at the conclusion of the last sentence what made Count  O'Dunn  tremble  If you do not know Madam you must ask the naturalistsanswered the Captain  Maria  had a quick conceptionshe found it dangerous to require a more minute explanation so requested I would proceed  O'DUNN'S NEGOTIATION  HER majesty of Portugal began the negotiation whereas it was the duty of the Count to have beganbut in truth he had forgot the interest of the  neutral  powers there was nothing neutral about him  Your prudence Sir said the Queen in not communicating your business to any of my ministers proves you worthy of your employment the business of politicks should never be carried on through a  medium    It is quite contrary in affairs of love please your Majesty answered the Count  You are certainly right replied the Queen giving up all thoughts of  politicks  a  medium  in love is to be preferredand the man who would reach a woman's heart must first discover the proper  medium  The cool lover is despicablean overwarm passion is seldom  lastingbut I should wish to hear your opinion upon the  subject    It is too difficult a subject for me said the Count I have attempted to discuss it a thousand and a thousand times but could never reach the  end  love is a subject which defies the power of logick of philosophy of mathematicks I have tried love  every way  said Count  O'Dunn  and I have been told that those who have tried it scientifically and systematically have found themselves little better than  fools  upon the  subject    I knew a  fool  said the old Dutchess of B taking her eye from the keyhole who could handle the subject better than the wisest of them all  Bless me exclaimed the Queen throwing her eye upon the Count's  forefinger  how remiss have I been in keeping you  standing  so long  It is my duty answered the Count to  stand  in your Majesty's presence  But as you are the representative of a King replied the Queen I insist upon your sitting  The Count being seated upon a sopha with the Queen proceeded upon the business of the neutral powershe presented his  credentials  the Queen of Portugal  examined  them she spoke of her obligations to England the Count withdrew his  credentials  from her handthe Queen drew them backexamined them againthe Count  pushed  the point  closer  still the Queen objected but  faintly  The Count maintained his  point    Your Majesty may perceive said the Count turning up his  credentials  towards the Queen so as to shew the two  brilliants  the Dutchess of Bhad mentioned your Majesty may perceive said he it is a plain proposition  The Queen of Portugal  answered    The Count  O'Dunn replied    The Queen of Portugal  rebutted    The Count  O'Dunn surrebutted  I  submit  said the Queenyou have  prevailed  I give EnglandI give up every thing I give up the world to your argument Count  O    Before the Queen could fully pronounce the Count's name  O'Dunn  had put the pen in her hand and her Majesty subscribed to the neutral confederacy  Oh ejaculated the Queen of Portugal  Ah ejaculated the old Dutchess of B and she fell upon the floorsuch is the power of sympathy it flew through the keyhole and hit the old Dutchess full on the brain  France has carried the day said the old Dutchess of Bopening the door and entering the room  Upon my soul but you are out now answered Count  O'Dunn  as he put up his  credentials  it was Ireland that carried the dayso making a bow he retired to dispatch a courier to Paris  Now the Dutchess of Bhaving written an account of  O'Dunn  's negotiation with the Queen of Portugal to Madam  D'C  Lady of the French Queen's Bedchamber the French Queen insisted that the French King should recall Count  O'Dunn  from an apprehension that he might be assassinated  UN PETIT SOUPER  THE eveningdew beginning to fall heavy  Maria  proposed returning home When we arrived at the town the Captain took his leave having previously insisted that I should accompany him the next morning at six to see a royal chace  Maria  as we walked towards her lodgings corroborated my suspicion that the Captain was a dying swain to virgin  Verjuice  and assured me of much entertainment from the history of his amours the Captain having for a series of years been a constant dangler after rich old maids and endowed widows of various descriptions  We found the cloth laid and supper was served in almost immediately after we entered the parlourtwo plates upon the table informed me that my company was expected  and having no inclination to retreat suddenly I sat down to table with as easy familiarity as if I had been one of the familyI saw  Maria  was pleased at the frankness of my conductand what can be more pleasing than an unceremonious chearful acquiescence in partaking of the hospitable preparations of a friendThe supper would have lost half its relish by a formal invitation  You must help yourself said  Maria  laying the wing of a duck upon her plate I followed her example  Here is wine said  Maria    A dumbwaiter which stood at my righthand answered all the purposes of ostentatious attendancewe sat in the full enjoyment of liberty and social festivityeat talked and laughed without restraint  I must fill to the brim said I taking up a decanter of Madeira  Maria  smiled consent it is to the continuance of our love my dear  MariaMaria  blushedshe hung her head but as she hung her head she turned up her eye  Let it overflow said  Maria  and she sighed let it overflowI will pledge you with all my soul  And I am all impatience added Imy heart is thirsty for the toast  We sipped from our brimmerstouched glasses and changed glassesI tasted the nectar of  Maria  's lip upon her glassthe touch had raised the sparkle
