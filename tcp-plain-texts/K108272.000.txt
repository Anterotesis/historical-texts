 THE LAW OF LIBERTY OR ROYAL LAW By which  all Mankind  will certainly  be judged  THE LAW OF LIBERTY OR ROYAL LAW BY WHICH  ALL MANKIND  WILL CERTAINLY  BE JUDGED  EARNESTLY RECOMMENDED TO THE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION OF ALL  SLAVEHOLDERS  AND  SLAVEDEALERS  BY GRANVILLE SHARP  So speak ye and so do as they that shall be  JUDGED  by  THE LAW OF LIBERTY  Jam ii  LONDON Printed for B WHITE at Horace's Head in Fleet Street and E and C DILLY in the Poultry  MDCCLXXVI  THE LAW OF LIBERTY OR ROYAL LAW  IN two former Tracts I have attempted to describe the JUST LIMITATION OF SLAVERY IN THE LAWS OF GOD and THE LAW OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE with respect more particularly to the due SUBMISSION of  Christian Servants  or  Slaves  to their  Masters  The purpose of the present Tract is not only to point out the reciprocal duty of  Christian Masters  to their  Servants  and all other persons with whom they are connected but also more particularly  to enable our  British American  Slave∣holders to examine or  measure  with very little trouble by  the Rule  of God's Holy Word  the Legality  or  Illegality of Slavery among Christians  For this pur∣pose some of the clearest and most essen∣tial  Maxims  or  Principles  of Scripture are selected and compared with each other in the following pages  So speak ye and so do as they that shall be  JUDGED  by  THE LAW OF LIBERTY  This the earnest advice of the Apostle James in his General Epistle ii and as it is therefore manifest that we shall certainly BE JUDGED by  THE LAW OF LIBERTY  it becomes a business of the utmost importance to ascertain what particular Law is thereby to be understood that we may  write it on our hearts  since our everlasting hap∣piness  depends upon it and the peril of eternal damnation seems to attend a breach of it  for he shall have  JUDG∣MENT WITHOUT MERCY  says the Apostle in the following verse  who hath shewed  NO MERCY  The ne∣cessary premises for the examination of the question are nothing less than the fundamental moral Principles of Chri∣stianity and if I am rather prolix in defining them I hope  the importance of the subject  will be considered as a suffi∣cient excuse for indeed  the subject  is not only  important  to those persons for whose use this Tract is particularly in∣tended  I mean those persons who desire to be satisfied concerning  THE LEGALITY  or  ILLEGALITY OF SLAVERY AMONG CHRISTIANS but to all Mankind be∣sides of every rank and denomination  All the moral duties of the Gospel are briefly comprehended in  two single  Principles  of the Law of Moses viz THE LOVE OF GOD and THE LOVE OF OUR NEIGHBOUR Nothing therefore can be esteemed truly  lawful  under the Gospel that is in the least repugnant to either of these and we need never be at a loss to distinguish what is or what is not so if we will but carefully consi∣der the proportion or degree of  that Love  which is clearly expressed to be  due  both to  God  and our  Neighbour  in these two comprehensive and eternal maxims The degree of  Love due to God  exceeds all comparison or consideration of other things for it must says the text be "  with  ALL  thy heart and with  ALL  thy soul and with  ALL  thy might  Deut vi which necessarily implies a most fervent zeal for the glory of GOD far exceeding all worldly considerations And with respect to the degree or true proportion of  Love due to our Neighbour  we have no pretence to plead ignorance  since the appointed  measure  of it is con∣tained in  every Man's Breast    THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF  Lev xix  On these two Commandments  said the Eternal Judge  hang  ALL THE LAW  and  THE PROPHETS  Mat The same Eternal Judge of Mankind made also on another occasion a similar declaration concerning the  Sum or Com∣pendium  OF THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS    All things whatsoever ye would that Men should do to you  said he  do ye even so to them for this is  THE LAW AND THE PRO∣PHETS  Matth vii This most excellent rule of conduct and be∣haviour towards  our Neighbours  which includes the whole Substance or Spirit of "THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS" so perfectly corresponds with the second great Commandment to LOVE  our Neigh∣bours as ourselves  viz to manifest our  LOVE  by  DOING  to them as we ourselves might  WITH REASON AND JUSTICE  expect and desire  THEY WOULD DO UNTO US that it seems intended like a sort of paraphrase to explain the true tenour of it for though the mode of expression is different yet the effect of the doctrine is undoubtedly the same because the Apostle Paul has in like manner declared this second great Commandment to be  the Compendium of "all the Law"  All the Law  says he  is fulfilled in one word even in this Thou shalt  LOVE  thy Neighbour  AS THYSELF  Gal v  SELFLOVE therefore must be the RULE or MEASURE not of Selfgrati∣fication or private Interest but  of our Conduct and Behaviour towards other Men  It must not be SOLE TENANT of the heart but is always to leave  equal  room for a due balance of  that Love which we  owe to our Neighbour  whenever the pre∣sent circumstances whatever they may be require a conscientious regard to the  publick Good  or a sympathetick conside∣ration for  the Feelings and Sufferings of Individuals  to enable us to fulfil  our Duty to our Neighbour  SELFLOVE is not hereby  excluded  for  Selfpreserva∣tion  and a prudent regard for our own support and happiness may still be al∣lowed an  equal Share  of our considera∣tion without a Breach of  this second great Commandment  which would otherwise be too hard and difficult for  Human Nature  to receive we are not commanded there∣in to love our Neighbours MORE  than ourselves  but only  AS  ourselves  so that SELFLOVE is apparently the  true Measure of our Conduct and Behaviour to∣wards other Men  and though an exalted Sense of  Duty to God  according to the  first great Commandment  may in some particular cases prompt Men to noble  actions wherein SELFLOVE may seem to be lost in a generous and benevolent regard to others of which there are several instances in Scripture as I have elsewhere shewn  See my Tract on  the Law of Nature and Principles of Action in Man  P  and also though the like admirable generosity and perfect dis∣interestedness may possibly upon some unforeseen occasion become likewise the peculiar duty of any one of us viz  to lay down  our  Lives for the Bre∣thren    Hereby perceive we  or rather it should be ren∣dered  Hereby have we perceived    the  LOVE of God  because he laid down his Life for us  said the Apostle and then he immediately informs us of the duty which arises from that extraordinary manifestation of LOVE  AND WE OUGHT says he TO LAY DOWN our LIVES FOR THE BRETHREN  John iii This plain declaration of our duty  c "WE OUGHT  to lay down our Lives  " c sufficiently enables us to account for the many extraordinary examples of SELFLOVE  being superseded by more noble Principles  some of which I have cited in my Tract on  the Law of Nature and Principles of Action in Man  p to which also the following may be added  THE GRATITUDE of the  Galatians  to their Teacher  Paul  is expressed by that Apostle in the strongest terms  I bear you record  says he  that if it had been possible ye would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me  Gal iv  Not inferior to this was the LOVE of that same Apostle himself towards  the Corinthians  though they were so far from returning a  mutual affection  like  the Galatians  that the Apostle it seems had reason to complain of their INGRATITUDE  I will very gladly  SPEND AND BE SPENT  for you  literally  "for your Souls"  said he  though the more abundantly I  LOVE  you the less I be  LOVED  Cor xii  To "SPEND AND BE SPENT" for others and that  "very gladly"  is the strongest expression of  disinterested  LOVE that could have been chosen It implies a chearful sacrifice of every thing that is dear in this world LIFE ITSELF NOT EXCEPTED  and greater Love hath no Man than this that a Man lay down his Life for his friends  John xv So that as  no Man can have greater Love than this  we may certainly esteem it the highest demonstration of  "perfect Love"  and as the sen∣tence last quoted from the Apostle John relates in its pri∣mary application to the voluntary sacrifice which Christ made of himself to save Mankind it leads us to the true foundation of that  "perfect Love"  enjoined in the Scrip∣tures which as the preceding examples demonstrate does occasionally overcome the general Principle of  Selflove  and every other  interested  Motive natural to "MAN  The Apostle John informs us no less than  twice  in  one  chapter that "GOD IS LOVE"  John iv  ibid v  This information is introduced in an argument whereby the Apostle endeavours to inculcate a due sense of the necessity we are laid under  to love one another  because GOD hath first  loved us  so that GRATITUDE TO GOD must be the foundation of our  "Love to one another"  and we are therefore bound to imitate and will certainly endeavour to imitate if "GOD DWELLETH IN US" See John iv that glorious Attribute of the  Divine Nature  LOVE "GOD IS LOVE" which he has manifested towards us by sacrificing all that could be  truly perfect  and  dear  in his sight even his only begotten Son who also  voluntarily submitted himself  for our happiness and  eternal  welfare to the most severe  temporal  sufferings and trials  even unto death  TO GOD and to the ETERNAL WORD therefore to whom we are indebted not only for that extraordinary manifestation of LOVE but for all other things that we enjoy even for our very existence our return of LOVE must be UNLIMITED and the  natural Principle  of SELFLOVE which is given as the measure of our LOVE  to our Neighbour  in the  Law of Liberty  or  second great Command∣ment  must be entirely suppressed whenever it falls in com∣petition with  the Love of God  enjoined in the  first great Commandment  and though this doctrine is very hard and difficult to be received and much more difficult to be practised as it includes the most exalted  Heroism  and  Greatness of Soul  that Human Nature is capable of attain∣ing yet we have ample reason to hope and trust as the discharge of our  Duty to our Neighbour  includes and fulfils the most essential part of  our Duty to God  that those men who carefully endeavour to make  "the Law of Liberty"  I mean  the second great Commandment  their  general  or  ordinary  Rule of Conduct IN LIFE will not want due assistance from the Almighty to enable them to fulfil also the duty which arises from  the first great Commandment  even UNTO DEATH if any extraordinary emergency should require such a manifestation of their LOVE because we are assured by the Scriptures that "GOD  dwelleth  " in those men who maintain the proper measure of  Love  and  Benevolence  for the rest of mankind  "BELOVED" said the  beloved  Apostle  let us  LOVE  one another for  LOVE  is of  GOD  and every one that  LOVETH  is born of  GOD  and knoweth  GOD  He that  LOVETH NOT  knoweth not God  FOR GOD IS LOVE  In this was manifested the  LOVE OF GOD  towards us because that  GOD  sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him Herein is  LOVE  not that  WE LOVED GOD  but that he  LOVED US  and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins  BELOVED IF GOD SO LOVED US  we ought also to  LOVE ONE ANO∣THER  No man hath seen God at any time If we love one another  GOD DWELLETH IN US  and his  LOVE  "is perfected in us"  John iv And again in the th verse  We have known and believed the  LOVE  that God hath to us  GOD IS LOVE  and he that dwelleth in  LOVE DWELLETH IN GOD AND GOD IN HIM  Herein is our  LOVE MADE PERFECT c    John iii yet as this far exceeds the measure of  Love  laid  down in the second great Command∣ment which is given us as the  general  or  ordinary  Rule of Life we may be assured that such a very difficult duty  as that of  laying down our Lives for the Brethren  can only be required of us on  very extraordinary occasions as in times of persecution or on other such pressing emergencies when some very singular Good or Benefit to our  Friends  our  Country  or  Mankind in general  appa∣rently depends upon our perseverance  unto death  for their sakes in a just cause  to the Glory of God  or to the manifesta∣tion of his revealed  Truth  for their confirmation and example This is in∣deed the best and most noble founda∣tion not only for true PATRIOTISM in all Men  as Members  respectively  of some particular Nation  but also for UNI∣VERSAL BENEVOLENCE  as Citizens of the World  which latter Duty should always regulate and limit the former viz PATRIOTISM by the eternal Rules of  natural Equity and Justice But though a chearful obedience in this ultimate Duty of  laying down our Lives  and sa∣crificing  Selflove  and every temporal Blessing  for the Good of others  does un∣doubtedly exalt HUMAN NATURE to the highest pitch of  Heroism  and  real Dignity  let us all nevertheless pray God as in effect we do by that compre∣hensive expression in our daily prayers  "Lead us not into temptation"  to pre∣serve us from any such severe trials of our Obedience and LOVE to him as the necessity of of  laying down our Lives for the Brethren  lest through the want of presence of mind or unwari∣ness or through weakness and natural infirmity any of us should unhappily shrink back from that ultimate Duty and thereby incur the dreadful con∣demnation of those that  deny Christ be∣fore Men  Let us also be truly thank∣ful that the  absolute Command  in the  second great Branch of our Duty by which  all Mankind are to be  JUDGED as shall hereafter be shewn extends no farther than to limit SELFLOVE by a sympathetick Consideration or  Fellowfeeling  for our  Neighbour  's welfare lest the former  Selflove  should be con∣sidered as the proper and  universal Principle of Action  and thereby en∣danger the peace and happiness of So∣ciety by its  partial  instigations let me add too that if SELFLOVE is not thus restrained it will defeat its own Purpose and fixed Principles of  Selfpreservation  by incurring a dreadful and eternal Doom  The OMISSION of an Act of  Mercy  and  Benevolence  towards our Neighbour when it is in our power and occasion requires it  is declared by our Lord the Saviour of the World  to be as gross an affront  even to himself  as if  he  had been  personally  neglected and denied by us  Inasmuch  says he  as ye did it not to one of the least of these  YE DID IT NOT TO ME  Matt xxv And if SINS of OMISSION even towards  the meanest of our Brethren  are by OUR LORD esteemed as a  personal Affront to himself  we may be assured that the actual COMMISSION of Injuries will be infinitely more heinous in his sight and cannot escape his just Vengeance We must remember also that  this Declara∣tion  of our Lord will be made to those miserable wretches who shall stand  on the Left Hand  after the tremendous final sentence is passed upon them  Depart from me ye Cursed into ever∣lasting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels  See verse  It is manifest therefore that  a Viola∣lation of  THE LOVE THAT IS DUE TO OUR NEIGHBOUR is a Violation also of  THE LOVE OF GOD and on the con∣trary  the latter is perfected  by a strict obedience  to the former"If we  LOVE  one another  " says  the beloved  Apostle  God dwelleth in us and  HIS LOVE IS PERFECTED IN US  John iv So that the two great Commandments appear to be reciprocally included and blended together in their consequences by which we may more readily perceive the propriety of our Lord's declaration that the  second great Commandment is like unto the first    Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind This is the first and great Commandment  AND THE SECOND IS LIKE UNTO IT  Thou shalt love thy Neigh∣bour as thyself On these two Commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets  Matt xxii to  and this reciprocal connexion between them enables us also to comprehend the reason why  the second  is given  alone  when BOTH are undoubt∣edly necessary as the grand test of Chri∣stian obedience and as the sum and es∣sence  of the whole Law of God  For all the Law is fulfilled  says the Apostle Paul  in one word  even  in this Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thyself  Gal v  Now a continued multiplication of Statutes as in England where the num∣ber exceeds the capacity of the human Memory affords matter only for  Equi∣vocation Doubt  and  Evasion  whereby SOUND LAW is vitiated and corrupted and the loathsome  Prostitute  still retain∣ing  the Name of  LAW  arises  like the Harlot POPERY from pure CHRISTI∣ANITY  in another Dress  She is clothed with the manycoloured garment of mis∣construction and seats herself at the right hand of the unjust judge prompt∣ing him with wily Subterfuges and  bad Precedents  instead of LAW whereby he is enabled to ensnare the innocent and screen the guilty But on the other hand when we consider that "ALL LAW" is  reduced to so small a compass that it may be accounted comparatively as ONE WORD there is no room left for offen∣ders to plead  Ignorance  as an excuse for having violated the general Laws of Morality and the  natural Rights of Man∣kind  Let me therefore exhort my op∣ponents as they regard their own eter∣nal welfare to take this subject into their most serious consideration and no longer refuse to acknowledge this glo∣rious WORD or  Maxim  as the TRUE MEASURE except a still greater measure of LOVE is required  This exception relates only to such extraordinary cases of emergency as are mentioned in pages to  of all their actions and more especially with respect to the present point before us the  Legality or Illegality of Slavery among Christians  For this question by infallible necessity falls under the decision of  this very Law  because it sets before us our own  personal Feelings  as  the proper Measure or Standard of our Behaviour to other  Men  for Tyrants Slaveholders Extor∣tioners and other Oppressors would most certainly dislike to be treated as as they treat others so that this com∣pendious Law necessarily excludes  the least Toleration of Slavery  or of any other  Oppression  which an  innocent Man  On the other hand  notorious offenders  that are clearly convicted of their crimes by the laws of the land may consistently  with reason and justice  be punished with a temporary DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY provided they be not  sold to strangers  nor even to  their own country∣men  to be subjected to  private dominion  or the  absolute rule of individuals  which is dreadfully baneful to mora∣lity The community at large and  that community only whose Laws they have broken  can alone have any RIGHT to detain them in  bondage  and this RIGHT of detaining should be moderated by such wholesome regulations for the religious  instruction  as well as  employment  of the un∣happy convicts as should apparently tend more to their  reformation  to render them worthy of being speedily re∣stored to  Liberty  than to any other object and no per∣sons whatsoever should be entrusted with the care in∣struction or employment of such  public delinquents  with∣out being subject to the inspection and  legal  controul of the king's judges and of other regular  crown officers  of the  Law department  but of no other  crown officers  as such whatever as also of the county courts of assizes and sessions courts of inquest grand juries justices of the peace sheriffs and of such other  legal  guardians of the public peace for and in behalf of the public lest the cause of  liberty  should suffer by the influence of any innovation in that respect  would be unwilling to experience in his own person from another  We must therefore acknowledge this heavenly maxim to be the true standard not only of  mutual Benevolence  among MEN but also of  our Love and Duty  to GOD since it includes the first great Commandment by  perfecting the Love of God in us  as I have before remark∣ed see p so that it must necessarily be esteemed the most sure and best foun∣dation "of PERFECT LIBERTY" And accordingly we find it expressly distin∣guished in Scripture by the title of  "the Law of Liberty"  "So speak ye and so do"  says the Apostle James  as they that shall be judged by  THE LAW OF LIBERTY  James ii This title properly be∣longs indeed to the  whole Law  or  Gospel of Christ  and seems to be so ap∣plied by the same Apostle in the pre∣ceding chapter th verse wherein he speaks of  the perfect  LAW OF LIBER∣TY  Yet the  general  application of the title does not lessen the propriety of that  particular  application which I con∣ceive to have been intended by the Apostle in this d chapter because the precept in question is  a complete Compen∣dium of Christian Morality  containing as I have before observed the  very Essence of the whole Gospel  or  general  LAW OF LIBERTY with respect to our  Duty towards Men  and has therefore an indisputable Right also to the  gene∣ral Title of the whole  But there are other reasons to justify the application of this  general Title of the Gospel  to that  one  comprehensive  Word  or Maxim in which  "all the Law is fulfilled"  Though the Apostle James seems to mean the  whole Gospel  in that passage of  his first chapter wherein he mentions "THE PERFECT LAW OF LIBERTY" Yet the whole tenor of his argument in the d chapter where he again men∣tions THE LAW OF LIBERTY is ap∣parently founded on the Principles of the glorious Maxim in question  THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGH∣BOUR AS THYSELF  for the  Subject  in the beginning of the chapter parti∣cularly relates to  the Duty we owe to  OUR NEIGHBOURS being a warning against  "Respect of Persons"  or  Partiality  and as the Maxim in question forbids even  Selfpreference  by directing us  to  love our Neighbours    AS  ourselves  it is so apparently suitable to the Apostle's  sub∣ject  that he expressly cites it under the eminent title of the "  Royal Law    to enforce his argument  My Brethren  says he  have not the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ  the Lord  of Glory  WITH RESPECT OF  PERSONS  and then after charging them in the d and d verses with  Par∣tiality  in  preferring  a welldressed Man in their assemblies to the  Poor  and after appealing to them thereupon in the th and th verses saying  Are ye not partial in yourselves  c and also after reproving them in the th and th verses for  despising the Poor  he adds in the th verse  "If ye fulfil"  says he "  the  ROYAL LAW    ac∣cording to the Scripture  THOU SHALT  LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THY∣SELF  which is the very Maxim in question  ye do well But if ye have  RESPECT TO PERSONS  says he thereby plainly pointing out this PAR∣TIALITY as a direct breach of the said ROYAL LAW  ye commit Sin and are convinced of the Law as Transgressors For whosoever shall keep the whole Law  continues the Apostle  and yet offend in  one  point  he is guilty of all For he  that said do not commit Adultery said also Do not kill Now if thou commit no Adultery yet if thou kill thou art become a Transgressor of the Law So speak ye and so do ye as they that shall be  JUDGED  by the  LAW OF LIBERTY  manifestly referring us to the  indispen∣sible Principle of doing as we would be done by  or to that which is exactly parallel  the loving our Neighbours as ourselves    FOR HE SHALL HAVE JUDGMENT WITHOUT MERCY  said the Apostle  THAT HATH SHEWED NO MERCY  and Mercy rejoiceth against Judgment  James ii to  This absolute necessity that we are laid under  to shew Mercy that we may obtain Mercy  is apparently founded on the very same  Principle  which our Lord declared to be  the Law and the Pro∣phets  that is the sum and essence of the whole Scriptures as I have before  remarked  ALL THINGS WHATSO∣EVER YE WOULD THAT MEN SHOULD DO TO YOU DO YE EVEN SO TO THEM FOR THIS IS THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS  Mat vii and I have already shewn in p that this comprehensive Maxim is exactly the same in effect though expressed in different words as the second great Commandment of our Lord  THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF  in which as the Apostle Paul has expressly declared  All the Law is fulfilled  viz "  All the Law  says he  is fulfilled in  ONE WORD even  in this  THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF  Gal v  This  one Word  as the Maxim is esteemed by the Apostle Paul is there∣fore undoubtedly that glorious  LAW OF LIBERTY  by which  we shall all  be judged  as the Apostle James hath fairly warned us  So speak ye and so do  says he  as they that  SHALL BE JUDGED BY THE LAW OF LI∣BERTY  And therefore if what has already been said be duly considered the propriety of citing this glorious and comprehensive LAW OF LIBERTY in vindication of the NATURAL LIBERTY OF MANKIND  against the Tyranny of Slaveholders  cannot be doubted or called in question for though this SUPREME LAW virtually prohibits every other kind of  Oppression  yet its very title leads us to a more particular and express appli∣cation of it AGAINST THE TOLERA∣TION OF SLAVERY AMONG CHRISTI∣ANS because it seems to be thus emi∣nently distinguished by the appointment of God himself in his Holy Word as  the peculiar Antidote  against that  baneful Evil  SLAVERY which is most opposite and repugnant to its glorious title  "THE LAW OF LIBERTY" This "LAW OF LIBERTY" this SUPREAM this "ROYAL LAW" must therefore be our guide in the interpretation and examination of all Laws which relate  to the Rights of Persons  because it ex∣cludes  Partiality  or  Respect of Persons  and consequently removes all ground for the pretence of any  absolute Right of Do∣minion inherent in the Masters  over their Slaves for as all Ranks of Men are EQUAL  in the Sight of God  the Christian  Slave  or Servant being  the Freeman  of the Lord and the Christian  Master  the  Servant  of Christ Cor vii there is no doubt but that the same  Christian  Qualities are necessary to be maintained by the  Christian  MASTER that are re∣quired of the  Christian  SERVANT as  Humility Forgiveness of Trespasses  or  Debts and  though not  Submission  yet certainly  Brotherly Love towards Infe∣riors  with  unfeigned Charity  and  univer∣sal  Benevolence  founded on the glorious Maxim or  Royal Law  THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THY∣SELF  All which are as indispensably necessary to form the disposition of a  true Christian Master  as they are abso∣lutely incompatible with the oppressive and tyrannical Claims of our American Slaveholders  Quod tibi fieri non vis alteri ne feceris What thou wouldest not have done to thee do not thou to another  was the favourite Maxim of the Emperor  Alexander Severus  ac∣cording to the Report of  Lampridius  quoted by the learned Jos Mede Book p This Principle was probably deduced from "THE ROYAL LAW" "or LAW OF LIBERTY" for  Lam∣pridius  relates that the Emperor heard it either from some Jews or Christians  Quod à quibusdam sive Judoeis sive Christianis audierat et tenebat  c  and it cannot be denied that the doctrine of it is necessarily included in that great and indispensable Commandment The doctrine was expressed even by Christ himself nearly to the same effect which I have already quoted  All things whatsoever ye would that Men should do to you do ye even so to them  FOR THIS IS THE LAW  and  THE PROPHETS  Mat vii So that Slavery is ab∣solutely inconsistent with Christianity because we cannot say of any  Slaveholder  that he  doth not  to another what he would not have done to himself For he is continually exacting  involuntary Labour  from others  without Wages  which he would think monstrously un∣just were he himself the Sufferer Nay many of them are so besotted with Avarice that they are not content with reaping  the whole Fruit of other Men's Labour upon Earth  WITHOUT  WAGES    Woe unto him that buildeth his House by Unright∣eousness and his Chambers by Wrong that  USETH HIS NEIGHBOUR'S SERVICE WITHOUT WAGES AND GIVETH HIM NOT FOR HIS WORK  Jer xxii  but would deprive their poor Labourers even of their  eternal Comfort  if they could exact a little more Work from them by reducing them nearer to the State of Brutes What I advance cannot be denied for it is notorious that  many Masters  oppose the instruction of their  Slaves  in Chri∣stian Knowledge and  but very few  pro∣mote it as they ought so that the Ini∣quity of the ignorant Slave must rest  with double Weight  on the guilty head of the owner to fill up the measure of his sins  Suppose a reverse of fortunethat an English or Scotch  Slaveholder  or  Slavedealer  is shipwrecked on the Bar∣bary Coast and is retained  as a Slave  by the Moors who seize him or is  sold as such  to another Person accord∣ing  to the detestable customs of that Savage peopleWould he esteem him∣self the  lawful Property  of his tawney Master because the wretched police of those Barbarians  in tolerating Slavery  is similar to his own former practices as an  American Slaveholder  or  African Trader  Would he not think it cruel treatment to be esteemed  a mere Chattel  and as such to be ranked with the horses and oxen of his African Master  Like them  to be compelled by stripes to perform the most servile and abject Labour  Like them  to receive  no Wages  or other  Reward  for his Service except a little  coarse Provender  merely to keep him in working Order for his Master's Benefit Would he not think himself grievously injured by being forcibly de∣tained and prevented from working for himself And would he not think him∣self absolutely  robbed of the Fruits of his own Labour  He would certainly have  ample reason to lament the Mahome∣tan's Ignorance of the heavenly Precept "THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGH∣BOUR AS THYSELF for he would then be taught by his own Sufferings to comprehend the full force extent and and meaning of that benevolent Com∣mand which in his prosperity he was never  willing  to understand though the doctrine is so plain and obvious that there can be no excuse for misunder∣standing it for unless the Slaveholder can make it appear  that his  SLAVE  is not his  NEIGHBOUR he must necessarily acknowledge  this  "LAW OF LIBERTY" to be  the true Measure  of his conduct and behaviour  towards his  SLAVE as well as  towards all other  MEN  Let not  Slaveholders  or  African Traders  conceive that they are at liberty to receive or reject this glorious Precept according as it may suit their interest  or convenience But rather let them carefully examine for they are particu∣larly interested in the determination of the question whether obedience to the doctrine of the great  LAW OF LIBER∣TY  is not absolutely indispensable And whether the violation of it is not dangerous to salvation  If they think there is any room to flatter themselves that they do not offend God by tolerating Slavery among them let them but examine their Actions by this "ROYAL LAW" and they will clearly perceive both their  Guilt and Danger unless they have Con∣sciences seared with a hot Iron"  "If ye have respect unto Persons"  says the Apostle James when he enforces the Observation of the ROYAL LAW  ye commit Sin and are convinced of  THE LAW AS TRANSGRESSORS  c ii  Now this Offence of  having Respect unto Persons  is a mark which strong∣ly characterizes  Slaveholders  as Violaters of "THE ROYAL LAW"  They are courteous friendly and hos∣pitable enough in general to Persons  of their own Rank  as indeed they ought to be but at the same time they look down upon their  Slaves  who are  equally their Brethren  as if they were  not Human Beings  and rank them as  mere Chattels  with their Horses and Dogs so that there needs no Argument to prove them guilty of  having Respect unto Persons  in a most notorious de∣gree whereby they surely  "commit Sin"  and are  convinced of the Law as Trans∣gressors  What therefore have such Men to expect when they shall be judged by "THE LAW OF LIBERTY" especially as the Apostle adds  they  shall have Judgment without Mercy that have shewed no Mercy  c  And even our Lord himself has de∣clared the very same doctrine though in different Words  With the same  MEASURE  that ye  METE  says he "  shall it be  MEASURED  unto you again  "  Luke vi Mat vii Mark iv  What MEASURE of  Benevolence  there∣fore have these Men to expect who endeavour to enrich THEMSELVES by  en∣slaving  and  oppressing  their BRETHREN For Men who  "without Mercy"  or Fellowfeeling have violated  THE ROYAL LAW OF LIBERTY  can neither be said to  love God  nor  their Neighbour  as directed in the two great Commandments and consequently are Violaters of  "the whole Law"  by which they absolutely deprive themselves of  the Benefit of Christ's Redemption This seems to be the necessary meaning of that dreadful Doom beforemen∣tioned  He shall have  JUDGMENT  without  MERCY that  hath shewed  NO MERCY  But let no Man conceive that I pre∣sume to charge Individuals or  any Per∣son in particular  with the want of this MERCY so necessary to Salvation even though they are apparently guilty of that oppressive treatment of their  Neigh∣bour  which I now oppose for this would seem like setting bounds to the  Mency of God  whereby I should be liable to involve myself as an  uncharitable Judge  in the same condemnation And there are certainly a variety of cir∣cumstances beyond the reach of human knowledge that may extenuate the guilt of  particular Persons  of which the great Searcher of Hearts alone can judge  It is not therefore  the Persons  but  the uncharitable Practices  of Slaveholders and Slavedealers that I now venture  to condemn  and these I can with confi∣dence affirm to be really  damnable  or  dangerous to Salvation  as being the most notorious violations of that Christian Charity or LOVE OF OUR NEIGHBOUR which God indispensably requires of us and without which the highest Gifts are vain and even  Faith itself  For  tho' I have  "ALL FAITH" said the Apostle Paul  so that I could remove Mountains and have no  CHARITY  I am nothing  Cor xiii The nature of this indispensable CHARITY is more particularly described by the same Apostle under the appellation of LOVE  "LOVE" says he  worketh no  ILL  to his Neighbour there∣fore  LOVE  is the fulfilling of the Law  Rom xiii But as the being de∣tained in  an involuntary Slavery  is one of the greatest ILLS or EVILS that can  happen to  our Neighbour  it must neces∣sarily be allowed that he who  causes  or  continues  such an  unnatural Oppression  of poor unfortunate  Strangers  who never injured him nor his nor ever volun∣tarily contracted to serve him even for the shortest term much less for life such a Man I say most certainly "  worketh  ILL  to his Neighbour  " and consequently violates that  saving  LOVE which is required for  the fulfilling of the Law  For  he that  LOVETH  another  says the Apostle in a pre∣ceding verse of the same chapter  hath fulfilled the Law  and after repeating the several Articles of the Decalogue respecting  our Duty towards our  NEIGH∣BOUR he adds  and if there be any other Commandment it is briefly com∣prchended in this  THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF  Rom xiii We may therefore fairly conclude that this glorious MAX∣IM  is the touchstone or proof of  that saving  LOVE which is THE FULFILL∣ING OF THE LAW and without which "FAITH IS DEAD" as declared by  the Apostle Paul  that it is also "THE ROYAL LAW" being thus eminently distinguished from all other Precepts of the Gospel by the  Apostle James  and if it  is not  also particularly signified though I am fully convinced that it  is  under the Title of  THE LAW OF LIBERTY  by the  same Apostle  in his d Chapter yet it is surely one of the most essential and comprehensive Principles of that "LAW OF LIBERTY" by which  we shall all be judged  be∣cause the Apostle at the same time de∣clares that "  he shall have Judgment  WITHOUT MERCY  who hath shewed  NO MERCY" chap ii by which he manifestly refers to the Breach of that particular Precept which ought to re∣gulate the Conduct of all Mankind to∣wards  each other and therefore lastly we must acknowledge this same Precept to be also THE TRUE MEASURE or Test on which our eternal Doom will depend in that awful Day when it  shall be  MEASURED  unto us again  according to  THE MEASURE of our Actions as declared by the  eternal Judge himself  Mat vii Mark iv Luke vi whose Words cannot fail And if even a mere  Neglect  or  Omission  in our Duty towards our  Neighbour  is so  offensive  to our blessed Lord that he esteems it as a Denial and Affront to his  own Person  which I have already observed how  much more offensive  to him must be  the actual Commission  of the grossest Injuries such as the Exaction of  an involuntary Service  from our poor Brethren  WITH∣OUT WAGES  and the various Cru∣elties usually practised to enforce the same which are the necessary and un∣avoidable Attendants on  Slavery  What  a dreadful MEASURE of RETRIBUTION then may obstinate and unrepenting  Slaveholders  and  Slavedealers  justly expect from the righteous Judge Surely there is but too much Cause to apprehend that Christ will one Day PROFESS UNTO THEM  Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my Brethren ye have  DONE IT UNTO ME  Mat xxv  This Sentence indeed is applied in the Text to those who shall have DONE GOOD to their Brethren yet by neces∣sary Consequence it is equally applicable as in the th verse to those who have neglected or shewn them  no Brotherly  LOVE and CHARITY"  Inasmuch  said our Lord  as ye did it not to one of the least of these ye did it not to me And these  by which our Lord plainly referred to all that should neglect or violate that indispensible  Brotherly Love  and  Charity  which he enjoined  shall go away  INTO EVERLASTING PU∣NISHMENT  but the Righteous into Life eternal  But alasto  worldly  minded Men the Judgments of  another World  seem too far distant to awaken their Atten∣tion though they are liable to be called away in the very next Hour to a State of Existence wherein the most pun∣gent Remorse will avail them nothing From such therefore and from those unrepenting Individuals that will still persist in violating the LAW OF LIBERTY by  Slavedealing  and  Slaveholding  it is time to turn away I have already be∣stowed too much labour upon them I mean with respect to themselves But this Warning was not intended for them alonethe whole Communityevery Individual without excepting even those who never had the least Concern in pro∣moting  Slavery  is personally interested in the Consideration of this Subject For if a Breach of God's Command even in the  hidden  Crime of a single In∣dividual as in the Case of  Achan  could involve a whole Nation in Trouble  "  For Achan the Son of Carmi"took of  THE "ACCURSED THING" i e of that which was  devoted to Destruction  by God's express Command  And the Anger of the Lord was kindled against the Children of Israel  Joshua vii Thus the whole NATION was involved in the Consequences of Achan's Guilt Nay  Jehovah  himself expressly imputed the Action of that one Individual to the NATION at large until a solemn and public Exertion of NATIONAL Justice had expiated that presumptive Breach of his Command For when Joshua and the Elders of Israel lay prostrate before God lament∣ing the public Calamity and Disgrace which a late De∣feat of their Army had brought upon the NATION  the Lord  Jehovah  said unto Joshua Get thee up wherefore liest thou thus upon thy Face  ISRAEL  hath sinned and  THEY HAVE  also  TRANSGRESSED  my Cove∣nant which I commanded them for  THEY  have even taken of  THE ACCURSED THING  and have stolen  that is THEY  have stolen    and  THEY  have dissembled also and  THEY  have put  it  even among their own Stuff  Yet this general Crime for so it was imputed was perpetrated by  a single Individual  though the  whole  NATION was doomed to suffer for it till the actual Ag∣gressor should be brought to  public Justice  and this should teach us that the Welfare of NATIONS greatly depends on a strict Administration of public  Justice  and  Righteous∣ness  lest the State should be accountable for the Crimes of Individuals  "Therefore the Children of Israel"  said Jehovah himself  could not stand before their Enemies  but  turned  their  Backs before their Enemies because they were  ACCURSED  Thus the CURSE was trans∣ferred to the People from THE ACCURSED THING until  public Justice  could trace and transfer it to the devoted Head of the guilty Person "  Neither will I  said Je∣hovah  be with you any more except ye destroy  THE ACCURSED  from among you  See the whole Chapter  and deprive them of God's Blessing  how much more hateful in the Sight of God must be a  public  Infringement of his ROYAL LAW THE PERFECT LAW OF LIBERTY by  national  Autho∣rity  The AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE which includes the most contemptuous Viola∣tions of  Brotherly Love  and  Charity  that men can be guilty of is openly encouraged and promoted by the British Parliament And the most detestable and oppressive  Slavery  that ever disgraced even the unenlightened Heathens is notoriously  tolerated  in the British Colonies by the  public Acts  of their respective Assemblies by Acts that have been ratified with the Assent and Concurrence of BRITISH KINGS  The horrible Guilt therefore which is incurred by  Slavedealing  and  Slaveholding  is no longer confined to the few hardened  Individuals  that are im∣mediately concerned in those baneful Practices but alas the WHOLE BRI∣TISH EMPIRE is involved  By the unhappy Concurrence of  Na∣tional Authority  the GUILT is rendered  National  and  National  GUILT must in∣evitably draw down from GOD some tre∣mendous  National  Punishment which I trust is fully demonstrated in my Tract on THE LAW of RETRIBUTION if we do not speedily  take away the accursed  Thing from among us  if we do not carefully reform and redress at least every  public  and notorious Violation of GOD's  "Royal Law"  the perfect Law of Liberty  GRANVILLE SHARP  "GLORY to GOD in the Highest  "And on EarthPEACE
