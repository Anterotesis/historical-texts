CONTEMPLATIST A NIGHT PIECE  I  T  HE nurse of CONTEMPLATION Night  Begins her balmy reign  Advancing in their varied light  Her silvervested train  II  'Tis strange the many marshall'd stars  That ride yon sacred round  Should keep among their rapid cars  A silence so profound  III  A kind a philosophic calm  The cool creation wears  And what Day drank of dewy balm  The gentle Night repairs  IV  Behind their leafy curtains hid  The feather'd race how still  How quiet now the gamesome kid  That gamboll'd round the hill  V  The sweets that bending o'er their banks  From sultry Day declin'd  Revive in little velvet ranks  And scent the western wind  VI  The Moon preceded by the breeze  That bade the clouds retire  Appears amongst the tufted trees  A Phoenixnest on fire  VII  But softThe golden glow subsides  Her chariot mounts on high  And now in silent pomp she rides  Pale regent of the sky  VIII  Where TIME upon the wither'd tree  Hath carv'd the moral chair  I sit from busy passions free  And breath the temper'd air  IX  The wither'd tree was once in prime  Its branches brav'd the sky  Thus at the touch of ruthless TIME  Shall Youth and Vigour die  X  I'm lifted to the blue expanse  It glows serenely gay  Come SCIENCE by my side advance  To search the Milky Way  XI  Let us descend The daring flight  Fatigues my feeble mind  And SCIENCE in the maze of light  Is impotent and blind  XII  What are those wild those wand'ring fires  That o'er the moorland ran  Vapours How like the vague desires  That cheat the heart of MAN  XIII  But there's a friendly guide a flame  That lambent o'er its bed  Enlivens with a gladsome beam  The hermits osier shed  XIV  Amongst the russet shades of night  It glances from afar  And darts along the dusk so bright  It seems a silver star  XV  In coverts where the few frequent  If VIRTUE deigns to dwell  'Tis thus the little lamp CONTENT  Gives lustre to her cell  XVI  How smooth that rapid river slides  Progressive to the deep  The poppies pendent o'er its sides  Have charm'd the waves to sleep  XVII  PLEASURE'S intoxicated sons  Ye indolent ye gay  Reflect for as the river runs  Life wings its tractless way  XVIII  That branching grove of dusky green  Conceals the azure sky  Save where a starry space between  Relieves the darken'd eye  XIX  Old ERROR thus with shades impure  Throws sacred TRUTH behind  Yet sometimes through the deep obscure  She bursts upon the mind  XX  Sleep and her sister Silence reign  They lock the Shepherds fold  But harkI hear a lamb complain  'Tis lost upon the wold  XXI  To savage herds that hunt for prey  An unresisting prize  For having trod a devious way  The little rambler dies  XXII  As luckless is the virgin's lot  Whom pleasure once misguides  When hurried from the halcyon cot  Where INNOCENCE presides  XXIII  The Passions a relentless train  To tear the victim run  She seeks the path of peace in vain  Is conquer'd and undone  XXIV  How bright the little insects blaze  Where willows shade the way  As proud as if their painted rays  Could emulate the Day  XXV  'Tis thus the pigmy sons of pow'r  Advance their vain parade  Thus glitter in the darken'd hour  And like the glowworms fade  XXVI  The soft serenity of night  Ungentle clouds deform  The silver host that shone so bright  Is hid behind a storm  XXVII  The angry elements engage  An oak an ivied bower  Repells the rough winds noisy rage  And shields me from the shower  XXVIII  The rancour thus of rushing fate  I've learnt to render vain  For whilst Integrity's her seat  The soul will sit serene  XXIX  A raven from some greedy vault  Amidst that cloister'd gloom  Bids me and 'tis a solemn thought  Reflect upon the tomb  XXX  The tomb The consecrated dome  The temple raised to PEACE  The port that to its friendly home  Compells the human race  XXXI  Yon village to the moral mind  A solemn aspect wears  Where sleep hath lull'd the labour'd hind  And kill'd his daily cares  XXXII  'Tis but the churchyard of the Night  An emblematic bed  That offers to the mental sight  The temporary dead  XXXIII  From hence I'll penetrate in thought  The grave's unmeasur'd deep  And tutor'd hence be timely taught  To meet my final sleep  XXXIV  'Tis peace The little chaos past  The gentle moon's restor'd  A breeze succeeds the frightful blast  That through the forest roar'd  XXXV  The nightingale a welcome guest  Renews her wonted strains  And HOPE just wand'ring from my breast  Her wonted seat regains  XXXVI  Yes When yon lucid orb is dark  And darting from on high  My soul a more celestial spark  Shall keep her native sky  XXXVII  Fann'd by the little lenient breeze  My limbs refreshment find  And moral rhapsodies like these  Give vigour to my mind  XXXVIII  Can the lewd orgies of your nights  Ye sons of rage and wine  Afford amongst your false delights  An hour of Peace like MINE  FINIS  Lately Published  PRICE SIXPENCE  AN ELEGY ON A PILE OF RUINS  BY J CUNNINGHAM
