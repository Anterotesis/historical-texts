 HE WOULD BE A SOLDIER A COMEDY IN FIVE ACTS AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL COVENT GARDEN  WRITTEN BY FREDERICK PILON DEDICATED TO MRS MONTAGUE  LONDON Printed for G G J and J ROBINSON Paternoster Row MDCCLXXXVI  Price One Shilling and Six Pence  DEDICATION TO MRS MONTAGUE  MADAM  THOUGH I can boast no acquaintance with Mrs MONTAGUE but that intellectual one which the world of taste in general claims with her I trust she will pardon the liberty of prefixing her name to a comedy the writer of which feels an admiration equal to her own for Shakespeare When research and criticism seemed exhausted in throwing lights on the works of this great fountain of English dramatic genius you Madam as if a spirit more congenial to his own approach still nearer to the Immortal Poet dispel the last mist which time had shed  around him and unveil the full glory of his mind The small tribute of respect I have presumed to pay your talents in the course of my comedy Madam was believe me the spontaneous incense of my heart and I have the satisfaction to reflect that no reader will suspect me of flattery in this declaration but one who is a stranger to your same and to your virtues  I have the honour to be MADAM Your devoted and obedient servant FREDERICK PILON  PREFACE  THE very great success which has attended the performance of the following Comedy induces the author to state a circumstance which on the first blush of the business must appear rather singular  He would be a Soldier  was presented to Mr Colman in the course of last Summer and returnedbecause  that gentleman did not like a line of it  and left this comfortable intelligence were not sufficient to wound the feelings of the writer Mr Colman added he did not know  what could be done with it or in what shape it could be produced so as to contribute to the entertainment of the public  The Author declares that he then entertained such notions of Mr Colman's  judgement taste  and high  sense of honour  that his opinion was final with him he laid by his performance in despair of ever acquiring profit or same by itfortunately an intimate friend one day advised him to show the piece to Mr Harris imagining even  Mr Colman might be mistaken  or influenced by  motives the  writer of this address  neversuspected any man harboured till bitter experience convinced him of the contrary Mr Harris to the very great surprise and no doubt very  great pleasure  of the author happened to be totally of a different way of thinking from Mr Colman and what is more he heard the latter gentleman's opinion of the Comedy but  had too strong and too good a mind to be biassed by it  The success which has attended the piece makes all farther comment on this short history of it unnecessary and with the liveliest sense of gratitude for the marked attention kindness and liberality of Mr Harris the author submits his production to the perusal of the world  PROLOGUE  WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR OF THE COMEDY AND SPOKEN BY MR FARREN  PROLOGUES were first plain simple bills of fare  You just were told your entertainment there  Without parade or aim at brilliant hit  Genius was thrifty then as rich in wit  Our modern bards a diff'rent plan pursue  And a fair outside always hold to view  With point and jest the prologue still must play  And strike each insect folly of the day  But folly now unstricken wild may fly  For the muse wasts a fav'rite to the sky  Can little objects charm or fill the mind  When Howard's claims are known to all mankind  Distance and clime in him excite no fears  He visits dungeons and the sick bed chears  Fearless of danger nobly on he goes  Round the whole globe to heal the wretches' woes  Brother to all who like himself had birth  He walks his Maker's messenger on earth  And in the monument his country rears  That country a divided glory shares  To a great people thus to merit true  Why for our bard shou'd we protection sue  Worth still you foster and where faults are found  You probe to heal and not enlarge the wound  The reason strong that guides your ev'ry aim  Cancels or seals disinterested fame  If English genius soaring eagle high  All nations drops still in a lower sky  It is because the sons of fame well know  The praise that's worth ambition you bestow  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Colonel Talbot  Mr AICKIN  Sir Oliver Oldstock  Mr QUICK  Captain Crevelt  Mr LEWIS

THERE'S no such thing as stirring out of doors for the fellows nowadaysI beg Sir you wou'd not follow me any farther  Johnson  I cannot leave you my sweet divine charming girl  Mrs Wil  To how many now have you repeated the same lesson before you met me this morning  Johns  To how many Were a dozen such fine women as yourself to appear every day in public there would be no such thing as walking the streets for you a man should have a piece of flint in his breast  Mrs Wil  He's a good handsome fellow and doesn't talk badlyThen you will persist in following me  Johns  How can I help it I follow a fine woman by instinctDo my dear kind cruel angel tell me where you live  Takes hold of her hand  Mrs Wil  But to what purpose I can never see you  Johns  Why not my love  Mrs Wil  Lord I am an old married woman  Faintly struggling to disengage her hand  You wicked devil leave me The neighbours will take notice and I shall get a bad name by you Do goI'm just at home  Johns  But which is the house you live at  Mrs Wil  I can't tell youbesides I think I see my husband talking to the orange woman at the door in the straw hat and scarlet cloak with a little curlypole boy in her hand eating gingerbread  Johns  Why that's the George inn 'Sdeath do you live there  Mrs Wil  Oh you devil I shall be ruin'd if ever you come after me  Johns  Zounds it's the very house I was going toIsn't it kept by one Jacob Wilkins  Mrs Wil  Yes it is  Johns  We're quite at home nowI suppose you're old Jacob's daughter  Mrs Wil  I happen to be old Jacob's wife tho'  Johns  Pray my dear how long are you married  Mrs Wil  A long time Sir  Johns  Not a long time I am sure from your looks  Mrs Wil  Looks are very deceitful especially those of married folks I was married Candlemas day fivelongmonths  Johns  Poor creature you have had a tedious time of it  Mrs Wil  But what's your business with Jacob Wilkins Can't I do it  Johns  Then you do Jacob's business sometimes  Mrs Wil  To be sure I do when he's out of the way Poor man it's a great relief to him  Johns  But this is a matter on which I must see himselfCol Talbot a gentleman of whom I think you must have heard if you be Wilkins' wife has wrote to him and desired I would see him in consequence of that letter were you at home when he received it  Mrs Wil  No I was not Sir but I have often heard of Col Talbot he's an Oxfordshire gentleman his family I hear was the makings of Wilkins Lord he has been a long time in the Indies and I'm told has made a power of money But is he come home Sir  Johns  He is and since his return has been down in Oxfordshire in search of Wilkins where he thought he still lived and would have come here himself now only he's very much indisposed  Mrs Wil  Bless your heart Jacob Wilkins has been in town and kept the George inn these ten years  Johns  He has made a very ungrateful return to his benefactor Col Talbot My master thought him dead not having heard from him so many years a conduct that was unpardonable considering his obligations to the Colonel and the great trust reposed in him  Mrs Wil  Great trust Lord Sir what was it  Johns  Why Colonel Talbot left a son in his carebut come along and I'll tell you the whole story by the way  Mrs Wil  We must not be seen together for the world my husband is as jealous as the vengeance  Take a turn down this next street and let me go home alone Follow me in about ten minutes but take care you don't speak to me as if you had seen me before  Johns  My dear Mrs Wilkins what do you take me for Do you suppose I never paid a visit to a married woman in my life  Exeunt  SCENE II  The Bar of the  George  Inn  Enter  Caleb  followed by  Wilkins  who appears greatly agitated  Caleb  What do you knock me about for at this rate Don't I slave like a horse from morning till night I wish I had gone for a soldier as my brother did  Wil  Your brother you dog I wish I had never seen either of your facesWhat shall I do I have no son to restore him  Bell rings violently  Cal  Coming coming There's a bill wanted in the General Elliot  Wil  Let them wait  Cal  But suppose they won't wait who'll pay off the score  Wil  Out of my sight sirrah or I'll pay off your scoreDon't you see my temper is ruffled  Cal  Yes and I feel it too  Bell rings  Coming coming up Sir  Exit  Enter Mrs  Wilkins  Mrs Wil  My dear Mr Wilkins what's the matter The whole house seems turned topsyturvy  Wil  I am ruin'd  Mrs Wil  Ruin'd Oh heaven forbid  Wil  I say woman I'm undone and the sooner I'm out of England the better  Mrs Wil  Lord lord you terrify me out of my wits Jacob  Wil  Suppose the best friend you had in the world had entrusted an only child to your care and that thro' neglect you had lost him what wou'd you have to say for yourself  Mrs Wil  And is that your case my dear  Wil  It is  Mrs Wil  But tell me how it happen'd  Wil  You have frequently heard me make mention of Colonel Talbot in whose family I was brought up  Mrs Wil  To be sure I have  Wil  It is a son of his I have lost  Mrs Wil  You astonish me But how came so great a man's son to be left in your care  Wil  Why you must know that Colonel Talbot previous to his going abroad was privately married to a beautiful girl who waited on his mother he had a son by this girl and as the child came into the world just as he was obliged to embark with the army for Portugal the war before last he left him in my care desiring me to let him pass for my own till his return and in case he was kill'd to continue the deception till the death of his father  Mrs Wil  And has the Colonel never been in England since  Wil  Never till within these few days therefore his son continued with me till he was twelve years old when I lost him  Mrs Wil  In what manner did you lose him  Wil  I cannot be certain but as he was a boy of great spirit and ever prattling of being a soldier I suspect he was inveigled off by a recruiting  party which at that time was beating up for men in the village  Mrs Wil  Didn't you acquaint his mother immediately with what had happen'd  Wil  She was dead  Mrs Wil  You wrote to the Colonel to be sure  Wil  There I was to blame I cou'dn't summon up resolution sufficient I thought he wou'd have attributed the child's leaving me to neglect or cruel treatment  Mrs Wil  The best advice I can give you is to tell Colonel Talbot his son is dead  Wil  But how shall I produce a certificate of that Should he examine the parish register and no record of such a child's death be found I shou'd be taken up and tried on a suspicion of murder  Mrs Wil  Then tell him the truth at once  Wil  Worse and worseHe'll suppose this a mere invention of my own to screen my villany else why was I silent so long and that I had been brib'd by his relations to remove an obstacle to their inheriting both his acquir'd and paternal fortune  Enter  Caleb  Cal  There's a gentleman from Colonel Talbot desires to see you  Wil  What's to be doneI dare not face him  Cal  What shall I say to him father  Wil  Was there ever any thing so provokingas this fellow  Mrs Wil  I have itShew him into the parlour my good boy and tell him Mr Wilkin's will be with him presently my good boy  Cal  "My good boy"Ecod she good boys  me to some tune this morning I hope there's no mischief in the wind for I'm sure those are the first good words I have had from her since she was my stepmother    Exit  Caleb  Mrs Wil  How old is your son Caleb  Wil  There's only a week difference between his age and young Talbot's  Mrs Wil  Pass him on the Colonel for his son  Wil  How  Mrs Wil  Put a good face on the matter and you'll not only slip your neck out of a halter but make your fortune I can turn Caleb round my finger Go and speak to this gentleman and let him know you'ill introduce young Mr Talbot to him immediately Do as I bid you and leave the management of the rest of the business to me  Wil  But what reason shall I give for not writing to him so long  Mrs Wil  You must say you never received one of his letters and your quitting the country will make it probable enough they might have miscarried  Wil  Then to give his son no better education  Mrs Wil  You must say he wou'd not take any better and you may find instances enow of as dull heirs to large estates to give colour to your story  Wil  And make a drawer of him too  Mrs Wil  Well he'll not be the first great man that has cried "Coming up Sir"What do you stand confounded for Away away man and let me break the matter to Caleb  Wil  It goes against my consciencebut selfpreservation will have it so    Exit  Wilkins  Mrs Wil  Alone  Now have I my gentleman under my thumbwhenever his tongue wags with the found of jealousy I'll threaten to discover upon himand I'll see my dear sweet fellow  who follow'd me home to day as often as I pleaseBut to prepare this great boobyOh here he comes  Enter  Caleb  Cal  Here mother I have brought you the bill  Mrs Wil  Well never mind the billI have something very particular to say to youDo you know Caleb that your father is a man of the first character in this town  Cal  To be sure he is for selling the best old port and sherry in the kingdom  Mrs Wil  But come sit down and listen to me  They sit  Cal  What signifies hearing so much about father's characterwho gets him that character Why CalebIs there one in the house fit to talk to a gentleman but myself  Mrs Wil  My dear Caleb let me intreat you to hear me  Cal  Dear CalebYes I'd listen to you all day for such words as these good words are sugar plumbs to me besides mother you can't think how pretty folks look when they are pleas'd  Mrs Wil  Do you know Caleb whose son you are  Cal  Whose son I amMy father's to be sure  Mrs Wil  Certainly but that father is not Jacob Wilkins  Cal  No  Mrs Wil  Colonel Talbot the great nabob just arrived from the Indies is your father  Cal  My godfather I suppose you mean  Mrs Wil  I tell you he's your own father You were given when an infant to my husband and he  was ordered to bring you up as his son it being necessary for family reasons which you'll know another time to conceal your birth  Cal  I always thought I was a better man's son than I appeared to beBut mother isn't this all a joke  Mrs Wil  Can my husband convince you that I am in earnest  Cal  He has often convinc'd me that he himself was in earnest as my shoulders can witness  Mrs Wil  But dear Sir I beg ten thousand pardons for keeping my seat so long  Getting up and curtfying very low  Caleb  keeps his seat with a vacant stare and chuckling laugh of joy  Cal  I thought I'd come to something at last  Mrs Wil  Your father's gentleman Sir is now waiting to see you  Cal  My father's gentlemanI suppose I shall have a gentleman too  Mrs Wil  Oh no doubt  Cal  Then there will be a pair of usBut you're sure now you are in earnest  Mrs Wil  Will you go and be convinc'd I am  Cal  Come along Mrs Wilkins I think that's your name  Mrs Wil  At your Honor's service  Cal  Great men are apt to forget such triflesbut I'll call and see you now and then tho' I am a Colonel's son  Mrs Wil  We'll always think there's nothing too good at the George for your Honor  Cal  But hark'e give old Jacob a hint not to forget himself and make too free  Mrs Wil  I hope Sir we shall never forget ourselves in your presence  Cal  Well well I hope not good woman A colonel's sonWhat a fool I must be not to  have found out this of my own accordBut it's a wise child knows it own father    Exeunt Mrs  Wilkins  ridiculing him  SCENE  a drawing Room at the House of Sir  Oliver Oldstock  Enter  Charlotte  and  Harriet  Char  How you teize me about this allaccomplished Sir CharlesI can't abide him  Har  Can't abide himI don't think it possible for any woman actually to dislike him  Char  Yet he's the last person breathing I shou'd elect for my  caro sposo  the man's well enough as an acquaintance he's lively does not want for understanding but the best of him is the talent he possesses for discovering the ridiculous wherever it is to be foundthen he paints it in colours so high and so pleasantly ill natur'd that a woman takes him in her suite as the natural appendage of superior understanding to shew that her wit has rais'd her above the power of ridicule and that she has the chief laughers in town upon her own side  Har  What you praise him for is in my mind the only exceptionable part of his character  Char  Lord what harm is there in a little goodhumour'd illnatureBesides what would you have people talk of when they meet As politics are to the men scandal is to our sexthese two subjects are the vast magazines of the major part of our ideas between them the heads of half the nation are furnish'd  Har  Have you seen Mandeville today  Char  Poor Harriet now do I perceive the cause of all this extraordinary zeal for the interests of the handsome Baronet you still are apprehensive if  you don't provide me with a husband I shall take your beloved Mandeville from you  Har  As he is sole heir to Colonel Talbot's immense fortune I know your father will proceed to the last extremities  Char  Dear Harriet rest perfectly satisfied in my friendship for you I never will have him I don't know what I would not do to avoid it My heart is at present a virgin tablet on which Love has not written a single character however shou'd things come to the worst you yourself must be my deliverer  Har  As how  Char  Ev'n by taking wing with your beloved swain for that blessed spot where law forges no setters for the heart and Hymen with a smile upon his cheek and his torch burning clear lights consenting votaries to the temple of real and lasting felicityHeaven and a generous uncle be prais'd who bequeath'd me ten thousand pounds independent of my father I am not oblig'd to sacrfice my own and my friend's happinessO glorious independencethou parent of every virtueno wonder so many noble hearts emptied their crimson fountains to preserve thee  Har  I'm asham'd Charlotte to have harbour'd a suspicion but for a moment that a mind like yours cou'd act unworthy of itself  Char  Now to put my theory into practice Here comes Mandeville do you step into the next room where you may overhear our conversation and you shall be entertain'd with a prologue truly antimatrimonial  Har  Dear Charlotte I am already perfectly satisfied  Char  But I insist on your going it will enterain you    Exit  Har  Enter  Mandeville  Char  My dear Mandeville I was just wishing for you if you had staid much longer I shou'd have been insupportably vapour'd nothing runs in my head but our marriage but I was thinking as the fondest couples have certain dull hours that hang heavy upon their hands how we two shall kill time during those spiritless seasons  Man  I suppose we shall follow the example of other people do all we can to make one another uneasy  Char  That's one way to be sure of killing time but we shall grow tired of that at last don't you think so Mandeville  Man  When I entertain a good opinion of a lady's wit it rids me of all apprehension on that score  Char  Sir your most obedient  Man  I thought your cousin Harriet was here  Char  My cousin HarrietLord what's my cousin Harriet to the purposeI shall grow jealous of you at this rateI wonder Mandeville what star shed its influence when our marriage was first talk'd of no two people breathing agreed better  Man  I always thought you the pleasantest companion imaginable  Char  We were continually laughing at one body's expence or another  Man  And as soon as we are married I fancy every body will be even with us  Char  Heigho  Man  What's that for Madam  Char  Not for a husband I assure you it was only a requiem to friendship going to be laid in the grave of matrimony Methinks we two are preparing ourselves for the penance of our future  union as knightserrant of old prepar'd themselves for the toils of chivalry I've read somewhere that those champions of distress'd damsels at first wore heavy weights to their armour which they fancied on removal would give a comparative lightness to the galling load with which they were about to tax their shoulders  Enter  Harriet  Har  Just now Mr Mandeville as I parted from my cousin a servant came and told me that your uncle Colonel Talbot was arriv'dYour father Charlotte has receiv'd a letter from him But what do you think It seems he has a son nobody ever heard of before  Char  A sonNow Mandeville if you can be content with your mistress and a moderate income I'm satisfied you may have her as the bulk of Colonel Talbot's fortune will certainly devolve to his son depend upon it my father will no more press my ladyship on your worship  Man  Madam my uncle may dispose of his property as he pleasesI sincerely rejoice at his safe arrival in England and as he has an heir I shall be the first to congratulate him on the event and I hope that heir may prove an heir to his virtues  Char  You are a generous fellow Mandeville and if it did not cost you so dear I shou'd congratulate you on the certain prospect you may indulge that we two shall never be one  Man  My dear Harriet  Char  Now why don't you say my dear Mandeville One as naturally follows the other as the echo does the found  Man  The occasion ladies I trust will apolo gize for my leaving you thus abruptly  Char  Oh go go you have my ample consentBut Harriet will you let him go off easily  Har  How can you be so ill natur'd  Char  She says she gives you leave to go but it's on condition that you do not dedicate a second of your time to any human being but her self longer than common decency requires it But Mandeville do you and I part as we ought a betrothed pair  Man  Yes Charlotte for we part wedded friends again  Exit  Manent  Harriet  and  Charlotte  Char  Now Harriet are all your apprehensions removed  Har  They are my friend Hope sits smiling at my heart and once more chears it with a prospect of happiness  Exeunt  End of the First Act  ACT II  SCENE  an Apartment at Sir  Oliver Oldstock's  Enter Sir  Oliver  alone  THIS is a devilish lucky hit the Colonel's having a son it enables me to provide for both my niece and daughterI expect from the latter a good deal of contradiction in this business but I like that I shou'dn't love her half so much as I do if she hadn't spirit enough to contradict meit shews she has an opinion of her own and gives me an opportunity to prove that I have one also but of a much superior kind and upon occasions of a very coercive quality it's one time in a hundred I can get any body to contradict me but men of large independent fortunes never hear the truthnobody has spirit enough to oppose them in discourseHenceforward I am determined to take no man by the hand who does not speak and look when we come to debate as if he wou'd knock me down in an argument Well I think I shall be as happy as a married man can be when my girls are disposed of my wife to be sure has a most unaccountable humour to suppose I'm jealous of her now she's in her fiftyfifth yearto do Lady Lucretia Oldstock justice she was once a charming woman but at present I think her as plain a  piece of goods  as a man could meet between TempleBar and Whitechapelhere she comes brimfull of news  Enter Lady  Oldstock  La Old  Was ever any thing so wonderful  Sir O  Nothing upon earth what's the matter my love  La Old  Why haven't you heard that Colonel Talbot has a son  Sir O  A sona dozen I dare be sworn if he wou'd but own them an old soldier has generally children in all the quarters of the globe  La Old  Sir Oliver you're a censorious man and judge of every body by yourself  Sir O  Upon my soul my dear you allow me too much credit I never was a man of all that gallantry no no I had a domestic magnet that attracted and fix'd all my affections united to such a woman as Lady Oldstock who could be a rover  La Old  Why to do you Justice Sir Oliver you have upon the whole made a very good husband and if it was not for the weakness of your temper in one particular we might live very happily  Sir O  Aside  Now she's off  La Old  If indeed I was one of the giddy flirts of the day it would be another thingbut a woman of whose truth you have had so many years experience to be jealous  Sir O  I tell you again and again I am not jealous  La Old  Ah Sir Oliver I wish you wou'd make your words good if any man of the least tolerable appearance pays me a common mark of respect don't you immediately sneer and say that fellow has a design upon you  Sir O  So I do I always think that person has a design upon another to whom he gives their  own way in every thing no no if I am to chuse a friend and an agreeable companion give me the honest fellow who contradicts me  La Old  Then you are not jealous  Sir O  No  La Old  No  Sir O  No damme if ever I was jealous of you  La Old  You are now more provoking if possible than ever when you find I hold your ridiculous suspicions in contempt you wou'd wound me another way and mortify my pride by insinuating that I never had attractions sufficient to have a civil thing said to me like other women  Sir O  Then it seems my Lady you have had your civil things said to you like other women in your time  La Old  There there it broke forth What it is to be married to a jealous husband  Sir O  Well all this I can bear because I like contradictionI consider the mind like a spring the more you press it the more vigour you lend to its elasticity since I can remember I always delighted to be of a different opinion from other people there's something wonderfully flattering to human pride in being singularbut in marriage it is absolutely neccessaryman and wife are like the contending qualities of bitter and sweet they naturally quarrel and exist by downright opposition  Enter  Charlotte  La Old  I'll submit my cause to the judgement of Charlotte  Char  Submit your cause to my judgement my dear ma'am by no means in all cases of matrimonial  litigation the parties should be tried by their peers  Sir O  Right my girl now in order to qualify you to be impanelled on suits of the kind I was that moment thinking about moving the court of Hymen to shew cause why a rule should not be granted to provide you with a husband  La Old  Whenever you marry Charlotte if you wish to be happy above all things avoid a temper like your father's  Sir O  And like your mother's also if you wish your husband to be happy  La Old  I clearly perceive my company is not agreeable  Sir O  Your strange turn of mind I confess Lady Oldstock is not altogether so agreeable but you see it does not make me angry  La Old  It's that that tortures meif I cou'd vex him it wou'd be a proof I had some power left but he treats me like a child  Exit Lady  Oldstock  Sir O  It's a spoilt one if I do  Char  Dear Sir let me follow her  Sir O  You shan't budge a step after herSoothing her in these humours is only adding fuel to fire Your mother Charlotte was born a coquette and will die one She was a reigning toast in her youth and to this hour expects the adulation of those days She had a whole army of lovers and what you'll say ought to make me set a very high value upon her indeed either from necessity or choice she hung like an overblown rose on the virgin thorn full four and thirty years waiting for me But come sit down and let me talk to you  They sit  I have for some time back observed Charlotte that the match I proposed to you with Mandeville does not meet your wishes  Char  I confess Sir it never didbesides I know that gentleman's affections to be engaged elsewhere  Sir O  I understand you he's fond of my niece Harriet well in the name of happiness let them go together I'll never mention his name to you again nor indeed shall I propose any match to you upon which I may expect rational contradiction  Char  Now Sir you speak like my fatherOh how my heart springs with gratitude and joy to hear those generous words from your own lips  Sir O  No my girl you shall never be sacrificed at the altar of PlutusI say sacrificedfor what is it in fact but a sacrifice to throw away a fine young woman upon a man it is impossible she should like as many fathers do every day who love money more than their children  Char  The liberality of these sentiments delight me they are so exactly in conformity with my own Dear Sir you have given me such spiritsDo you know when you ask'd me to sit down I expected to have a quite different kind of conversation with you  Sir O  I suppose you thought I had some golden calf to propose to you for a husband  Char  I own I was so ungenerous  Sir O  A fellow with nothing but gold in his pocket and lead in his pate ha ha ha  Char  Ha ha ha  Sir O  How liable we are to be mistaken in our surmises of other people's thoughts No no my girl I have no such match to propose to youI have a husband for you it is true in my eye and a rich one toobut it is not to riches you objectit is to the man and provided he be agreeable I imagine no woman in her senses can suppose a husband may be too rich  Char  Provided riches be obtained without leaving a stain upon the principles it is happiness to possess them as they give us so much more ample power of distributing felicity I never was that romantic fool to imagine there can be happiness where there is not independency grant me that and all the wealth beside which the earth contains or the seadevours shou'd not bribe me to sell the free election of my heart or barter for gold what gold could never restore me  Sir O  Give me a kiss you jade You are your father's own daughter but every body tells me you're the picture of me and if the Colonel's son be but as like his father as you are yours you'll be the handsomest couple in Great Britain  Char  Rising  The Colonel's son Sir  Sir O  Yes my old friend Colonel Talbot's son one of the finest young fellows I am toldbut no sophe has none of the vices and follies of your young butterflies of fashion  Char  No Sir nor any of their accomplishments or I'm misinformed  Sir O  It was an excellent thought of his father's to have him brought up in a snug private way  Char  And yet I'm told he has lived some time in a snug public way  Sir O  What Charlotte have you been listening to any scandalous reports of the youth  Char  A pretty youth I understand he is for the husband of your daughterI am told he was actually a waiter at some horrid place near Smithfield  Sir O  Oh infamous scandalHe a waiter at some horrid place near SmithfieldThe next report I suppose will be that you were bar maid at the same places and that I'm an old tobacconist who supplied the house with cut and dry from the sign of the Black Boy in a neighbouring alley  Char  I am petrified as the very thoughts of the brute  Sir O  Look you there now she knows I love contradiction in my heart and therefore seems averse to the match because she thinks it will please me But come you and your mother and my niece shall go pay the Colonel and his son a morning visit  Char  Sir as you insist upon it I will go as I wou'd to see any other great natural curiosity  Sir O  Was ever any thing like this she has heard a scandalous report of a man and she won't wait to be undeceived by her own eyes and her own ears this is downright inconvincible obstinacy not rational wellfounded contradiction and I hate the one as much as I love the other besides I ever thought you a girl of too much sense to lay any kind of stress on a tale of mere rumour  Char  But if rumour shou'd speak truth  Sir O  He's so great a lyar I wou'd not believe him  Exeunt  SCENE  an Apartment at  Mandeville's  Enter  Johnson  and Colonel  Talbot  Johns  He's a rough diamond Sir he requires a little polishing I must confess  Col  Good masters may remove his ignorance and good company polish his manners but there is a meanness in the turn of his person and the cast of his features which is insuperable but take man in every point of view and he will be found the creature of habit his body like his mind is subdued by education  Johns  I wonder Sir you never wrote to any particular friend in England to have inquir'd about him when you receiv'd no letter from this man to whose care you committed him  Col  Who cou'd I trust None of my own family Then what solid friendships do you suppose are contracted at the age I left England I was then but twenty all my intimates were young fellows sunk in pleasure and dissipation if any thing like friendship had subsisted between us the many years we were asunder had dissolve'd the tie his mother I knew was dead and from Wilkins's silence I concluded that he also had paid the debt of nature therefore I defisted from writing thinking it was in vain to hope for any certainty till I had myself reached England  Johns  I shou'd not have believ'd it possible your Honor cou'd have had such a son let his education be what it may  Col  I own Johnson the weakness of a father induc'd me to believe I shou'd have found him very different I fancied I shou'd have seen him emerging from the low contracted sphere to which his fate had consign'd him by the native energy of his own powers and flatter'd myself with the pleasing dream of surprising a young man with affluence and distinction who in obscurity had acquir'd virtue to deserve them  Johns  I beg your Honor's pardonbut as I cannot see the least likeness of you in this young gentleman's face I suppose he resembled his mother  Col  His motherShe had the countenance of an angel  Johns  Then he differs from you both most devilishly But Sir the sooner you provide him with a fencing and a dancing master the better the latter of these gentlemen seems indispensably  necessary if it's only to teach him to walk for no raw recruit on the first day of drilling was ever more pigeontoed  Col  Where is he now  Johns  I left him Sir very busy over his luncheon  Col  His luncheon  Johns  Yes Sir a small morsel he takes before dinner just to stay his stomach consisting of about a pound of beaf steaks and a tankard of porter  Col  Send him to me    Exit  Johnson  I fear he's incorrigibly gone beyond the power of reformation  Enter  Mandeville  Col  Dear Mandeville what course do you advise me to pursue with this untoward boy With all his faults I must consider he is my son and pity whilst he compels me to blush for him  Man  Sir we must endeavour to form him as well as we can but I am rather inclined to think we shall never be able to give him the graces  Col  He's not three and twentythat's young we have many begin later in life to acquire the rudiments of those sciences in which they afterwards arriv'd to the highest pitch of eminence Have you been able to discover how the natural bent of his temper inclines or if he has any strong propensities  Man  Why Sir from what I can collect in my short acquaintance with him the natural bent of his temper seems inclin'd to gallantry and if he has any strong propensity it is to the game of skittles  Col  No matter how low and vulgar the game be it shews a spirit of play in him and it must be crush'd but if he has a turn for gallantry  it gives me the greatest hopes of his reformation The society of an accomplish'd and beautiful woman softens and refines the roughest nature she imparts by a secret magic her elegances and her graces and to converse with her is a kind of study that insensibly polishes her admirerBut what reason have you to suppose he is inclin'd to gallantry  Man  He has imparted all his amours to me but one in particular which very much diverted me indeedAfter having been successful with bar maids young milleners and taylors' daughters out of number Cupid shot him from a cheesecake battery and he fell in love with a pastrycook's daughter which oh terrible was the cause of his having an affair of honor with an attorney's clerk in which both parties were bound over but in painting this Helen who bred the contention how shall I do him justice at second hand Teniers lent him his pencil for her waist and Titian for her head for she was shap'd like a Dutch cheese and her locks were as red as a carrot  Col  I have sent for him and as I shall examine him closely in order to search if there be any latent seeds of ability which culture may bring forth I wish you Mandeville to be present and that you will also assist me in the inquiry  Man  Certainly as my cousin I think it a duty I owe himOh here he comes with Johnson  Enter  Caleb  and  Johnson  Cal  Speaks as entering  You don't know what's taste my hair's the nattiest thing in town as it's dress'd now  Cal  Don't you know Sir I sent for you  Ca  Ah fatherCousin are you there too  Man  You don't attend  Ca  Attend no I hope I shan't attend anymoreWell father you sent for me now what do you want my old cock  Col  Turning away with disgust  It is in vain to think of cultivating a soil like this  Man  His manner is terrible to be sure but we must correct him  Ca  Correct him Why what have I done to be corrected I thought I was corrected enough by my last father  Col  Wou'd that correction had taught you to speak  Ca  That it did and often to squeak too till you cou'd hear me two streets off  Col  Speak to him MandevilleThere is something so barbarous in every thing he says or does that I can't bear to look at him  Man  You'll excuse me dear cousin for giving you a little advice but as I mean it well I'm sure you'll not be offended  Ca  Bless your heart you can't offend me I'm one of the besttemper'd boys breathing but what's the matter with old Firelock He seems in the sulks  Man  He's not pleas'd with your manner and address it is too rude and abrupt you shou'd never approach him without evident marks of respect  Ca  Oh I understand you I shou'd always make a bow when I come into a place where he isEcod with all my heart but what set me wrong was hearing it said that to have no manners at all was the best of breeding  Man  Ceremony is altogether as ridiculous as  udeness is offensive you must avoid both  Col  Have you ever read any thing in your life  Ca  Why do you think I can't read Then I tell you I can and write and cypher too  Man  He doesn't doubt that he only wishes to know what kind of reading or books you are fond of  Ca  Then you may tell him I am fond of histories  Man  That's a good hearing faith If he's fond of history he must possess from nature a strong inquisitive mind under all this unpromising d'abord Men educated in a low sphere of life however uncouthly they express themselves often manifest a strong intellect and on being put to the test discover a fund of knowledge the bettereducated man wou'd not expect from a slight acquaintance with them I consider such minds like rich metals as yet unpurify'd from alloy but let it once be known that the ore is gold and the refiner's hand will soon bring forth the bullionAs you are fond of history you have no doubt dipt into the histories of Greece and Rome  Ca  The best of their histories  Man  Whose were they  Ca  Why in the first place I have read Don Bellianis's History of Greece and the Seven wise Masters' History of Rome  Col  Ask him no more questions  Ca  Then I've read the History of Colonel Jack and the History of the English Rogue and the History of Moll Flanders  Man  He appears as well read in modern as ancient history  Col  I don't know any thing more mortifying to human pride than to pass the better part of a man's life in toil anxiety and danger accumulating wealth to leave it to a fool at last  Ca  You can't think father how sensible money  makes a fool look and how foolish a wise man looks without it  Enter Servant  Serv  Mr Serge your Honor's taylor  Man  He's come to take measure of my cousin for his regimentals  Ca  Regimentals Why am I to be a colonel as well as my father  Col  Sir you're to be a soldier  Ca  A soldier Why what's all this Am I to go for a soldier after allHas Doll Blouze been with the parish officers  Col  I have procur'd you a commission no son of mine shall waste his youth in ease and indolence dissipating that wealth I so hardly earn'd the greater part it is true he shall enjoy but he shall first prove by his courage and his services to his country that he deserves it  Ca  There's not a boy within the sound of Bow bell of a better spirit I'll fight any man in England of my weight and inches with fair sistesses for a guineaaye damme if I don't and say down first  Man  Hadn't you better step to the taylor  Ca  Presently presently cousinBut now I think of it I'll not step to him let the taylor step to meA captain step to a taylor Impossible that's bidding a field piece dance the hayes after a thimble  Col  I insist upon your going this moment  Ca  Why the old boy's in his tantrumsCousin a word in your ear there's one thing before I go I must beg of you  Man  What's that  Ca  Why as you and I will be hand and glove as a body may say you'll call me Caleb  and I'll call you Tom Frank Harry orwhat is your name  Man  My name is Frederick  Ca  Frederick what a pretty name I wish my name was Frederick Can't I be newchristen'd for one name as well as another  Man  Aside  Till you're new born I fancy nothing can be done with you  Ca  But I was going to tell youif you call me Caleb never do it loud especially in company  Man  For heav'n's sake why  Ca  Why if you was to cry out as thus now Caleb  Bawling out  I should cry "Coming up Sir" tho' you made a duke of me    Exit  Caleb  Col  Well Mandeville what do you think  Man  Hope is left us in the worst of times however I do not despair of making something of him yet what I dread most is introducing him to Charlotte  Col  Why cannot man make over his mind like his property to his children Any distinguishing quality in all other animals survives in the same species by hereditary descent for ever man continues upon the earth only in his name and his revenuesOh that he should leave behind him his least valuable part and all that made him good or great should sink into the dust with him  Enter  Johnson  Johns  Good news good news Sir the Carnatic is arriv'd safeCaptain Crevelt's servant is just come to acquaint you that his master and Count Pierpoint will be here immediately  Col  Good news indeed Johnson and heavy and afflicted as my heart is your tidings cheer it  The Count Mandeville is an officer of infinite merit he was my prisoner during the war and is warmly attached to English manners and our glorious constitutionBut Creveitto know the merit of such a man you must be acquainted with him  Man  Is he an Englishman  Col  Yes and you may judge of his merit as a soldier when I tell you he has risen from the ranks at the age of three and twenty to the commission he now holds of captain He's the reverse of this illfated boy we have been speaking to He is selfeducated for with scarce any advantages but those he deriv'd from a most noble and excellent nature he is the man of sense the scholar and the polish'd gentleman His father old Crevelt was no more than a serjeant and serv'd in Germany under Lord Granby he brought this young man with him to India whilst yet a boy the first day he ever was in action he saw his father fall and he was found after the battle amongst the slain close to his body apparently lifeless with loss of blood as if he had died in the pious office of defending a parent  Enter Servant  Serv  Captain Crevelt Sir  Man  Let us go and receive him my heart burns with impatience to call such a man my friend  Exeunt  End of the Second Act  ACT III  SCENE Mandeville's  House  Enter  Mandeville Crevelt  and Colonel  Talbot  Crevelt  I QUITTED England Mr Mandeville when a boy and never was in London in my life before I am charmed with the appearance of this noble city in which the ease convenience and safety of its poorest inhabitant seem consulted  Col  There is no token seen in the streets of an exhausted people drained by a tedious and expensive war during which Great Britain fought at more unequal odds than any nation on the earth ever did before  Crev  So much the reverse that I am astonished at the appearance of opulence and prosperity to be met with every where and the pleasing sensation I feel to find my country in that state is indescribable  Col  Let gloomy politicians continue to predict and foresee calamities that exist only in imagination whilst the genius of industry continues to smile upon the labours of the husbandman the mechanic and the manufacturer and whilst strict probity is the character of England in her dealings with all other nations the resources of this country will be found inexhaustible and though its glory may be veiled by a momentary cloud it soon recovers its former splendour  Enter  Caleb  in Regimentals  Ca  Here I am father in full feather  Col  What Sir is your dancing master gone already  Ca  Bless your heartno master of any kind for me to day I never put on a new suit of clothes in my life that I did not make holiday  Man  Aside to Col  We had better I think in some degree give way to him you cannot expect immediately to reform manners so long confirmed by habit  Col  Aside  I believe you're right so I'll try what effect indulgence may have on him Well it shall be as you wou'd have it this day shall be devoted to pleasure and amusement Crevelt give me leave to introduce you to my son  Crev  I don't know any circumstance of my life affects me more than the high honor I now enjoy  Introducing himself  Ca  Why look ye young man as my father desires it I'll shake hands with you with all my heart but I wou'd not make so free with every old soldier's son  Col  How dare you Sir insult a man of his merit with language so gross  Ca  Why isn't he an old soldier's son pretty company truly to introduce me to  Crev  Sir the humility of my birth I acknowledge but must tell you this is the first time it ever brought a blush into my cheekI am choaked with rageUnused to insult I cannot receive it without indignation even from the son of Colonel Talbot  Col  I insist upon your asking that gentleman's pardon  Ca  Why is he a gentleman  Col  A man of his worth his honor and abilities is a gentleman though sprung in the lowest vale of society  Ca  Nay if you say he's a gentleman I ask his pardon with all my heart nothing so common nowadays as one gentleman's asking pardon of another it makes up a quarrel in a trice  Crev  Sir I accept your apology  Col    To  Caleb  But Sir I will go farther with youYou must ever consider that man with respect learn to esteem him and it will do you more honour than your birth has done  Enter Servant  Serv  The gentleman from the India House Sir thar was here before today has called again  Col  Let him know I'll wait on him immediately  Exit Servant    To  Caleb Young man I wish to undeceive you in one particular seize all those opportunities of instruction I mean to give you and redeem the time you have lost which if you neglect your provision from me shall be merely independence my name you may disgrace but I think it a crime to bestow riches on one who would abuse them even that youth whose birth is so inferior in your eye I should consider as united to me by his merit in nearer ties of kindred  Exit Colonel  Ca  Strutting about  So then I am to be disinherited after all and for an old soldier's son too  Crev  What's that you say Sir  Ca  Say SirDamme he looks so fierce I don't know what to say to himthese old soldier's sons are so used to cutting of throats it's the devil to quarrel with them  Man  I am ashamed of you cousinIf you proceed in this manner you must be look'd up from all society  Ca  I'll beg his pardon again I know that's all he wants  Crev  I'll spare you Sir the mortification of descending to so humiliating an act in respect to your father I overlook every thing you have hitherto saidI now coolly behold all that had past through a different medium and rather feel for a youth who from his prospect of immense wealth has been perhaps from his childhood surrounded with sycophants who never let him know what it was to be acquainted with himself and persuaded him into an opinion that wealth supplies the absence of every accomplishment and virtue  Ca  I don't rightly understand you Captain but I fancy only you mince the matter that you meant to say I was much better fed than taughtWell no matterAre we good friends again  Crev  Very good  Ca  Then give me your hand  Aside  He he he I can't help laughing after all to think of such a fellow's being a gentlemanBut I say Captain they tell me you are a devil of a fellow  or fighting now do you see me as I am an  fficer as well as yourself I'd be glad to know  ow you generally found yourself before you went  nto the field of battle  Crev  Much as I do at present  Ca  What no more frighten'd  Crev  No Sir  Ca  Come come no tricks upon travellers  aptain do you think I'm such a fool as to be  ve you  Crev  Sir  Ca  Terrify'd  SirHe looks at me like a tigerI'll ask him no more questionshe has half fright'ned me out of my commission alreadyeh  Looking out  Ecod yonder I see my father talking to two fine girls I'll go have a peep at them Cousin Mandeville good byeCaptain your servant  Stifling a laugh  a gentleman truly What a fine thing it is to be born oneit saves a world of trouble in learning    Exit  Caleb  Man  The story of this unhappy young man and how his education came to be so much neglected is too long to acquaint you of particularly at present but you see what he is and I hope estimate an insult from him accordingly  Crev  I think no more of itbut my heart bleeds for his father  Man  You talk of leaving town todaywhy dear Sir will you so suddenly quit friends who of all things covet your society Is the business which calls you from us of that urgent nature you cannot postpone it for a few days at least  Crev  It is what I ought not to dofor my relations in England if I have any living have never heard from me since I quitted the country but perhaps it's better to prepare them for the meeting so I shall write to them by this night's post and continue your guest a little longer  Man  Now this is truly friendlyI wou'd n't for the world have you leave town till after my Cousin Talbot's wedding  Crev  Then he's going to be married  Man  So his father intends as the only means of reforming him the lady is one of those two who came here within this half hour and whom we left with Count Pierpoint admiring his magni+ficent present from the different princes of the East at whose courts he has been occasionally envoy  Crev  But which of the ladies is intended for Mr Talbot  Man  Charlotteshe whom you so much admired and short as the Count's acquaintance with them is he appears already smitten with her Cousin HarrietUnluckily for him she happens to be engaged  Crev  But Charlotte It is she then who is intended for Mr TalbotI think I never saw a finer girl  Man  She's a divine creature and though her Adonis is so near a relation I confess I wish her a better husbandbut I don't know how matters may terminateShe's a girl of great spirithas a a very fine independency and such is her disposition that I'm confident there is no temptation in wealth could induce her to marry any man whom she did not like  Enter  Harriet  Har  Ha ha ha I beg your pardon Mr Mandeville for laughing so much at the expence of your Cousin Talbot but his manner person and conversation are all so truly original that gravity itself must be provok'd to laughter in his company  Man  It's very true Harriet he is a most extraordinary being I must confess  Han  He introduc'd himself to Charlotte this moment and such a figure does he cut He can neither walk sit nor stand still with gazing at his personCharlotte and he are together she seems delighted with him  Crev  Then Ma'am she likes him  Har  She likes to laugh at him SirDo Mandeville come and take a look at him  Man  Will you go Captain Crevelt  Crev  I'll just speak to Johnson Sir and follow you    Exeunt  Man  and  Har  I never saw that woman in my life before who in a moment has had such a power over meShe will not marry him they saybut what then Does it follow of course that the must like me  Enter  Johnson  Johns  I understand your Honor wish'd to see me  Crev  Yes Johnson as you came to London before me I wish'd to ask you if you knew any thing of the family of this young lady your master intends his son shall marry  Johns  Why Sir I understand she is the daughter of a Sir Oliver Oldstock an old acquaintance of the Colonel'sher father I hear meant she shou'd marry Mr Mandeville supposing he wou'd be my master's heir but when a son made his appearance like all worldly men Sir Oliver chang'd his note and the poor young lady is to become a sacrifice to thisI wish he wasn't my master's son  Crev  But she won't Johnson be made a sacrifice  Johns  I hope not Sirbut lord what won't money do Don't we see money every day couple age and deformity to youth and beauty a young creature like an angel link'd to an old skeleton of dry bonesas if the Daemon of avarice and sin had acquir'd such ascendancy in the world as to bring about an union betwixt death and immortality  Crev  Why Johnson you speak with great feeling and spirit on the subject  Johns  Ah Captain Crevelt what a charming couple you two wou'd makeI who have seen  your Honor in the field wou'd expect a Granby or a Marlborough from such a marriage  Crev  Musing  I promised to follow them but the less I see her the better for my peace it's only feeding a passion I shou'd banish from my heart for everJohnson take no notice that I have ask'd you any questions concerning Miss Oldstock shou'd I be inquir'd for I am gone to the libraryBooks or my own thoughts are the only society I am fit for    Exit  Crev  Johns  Well as long as I live I never will think there is any thing in great blood again Here is a son of one of the best families in the kingdom with neither person nor mind superior to one of his father's domesticsand if we turn our eyes to the other side we behold the offspring of an old soldier with the soul of a prince and the head of a prime minister  Enter  Nancy  running  Nan  Mr Johnson Mr Johnson here's a letter for you brought by the penny post  Gives it  and short a time as you have been in London I'm sure it's a love letter  Johns  Aye pray Nancy how have you made that discovery Is it by the elegant penmanship of its pothookandhanger superscription or by the God of Love's own broad seal stamp'd upon it by a wafer and thimble  Nan  Ecod Mr Johnson you're a knowing hand I'll engage you have hook'd in many a poor girl in your time  Johns  But I haven't paid the postage  Nan  That's always paid beforehand into the office with the letter  Johns  But you know Nancy letters are convey'd  now upon a new establishment and for fear of mistakes I'll ev'n pay double postage  Kisses her  Nan  It's mighty well I suppose when you find this is a mistake you'll be for having the overcharge back again    Exit  Nancy  Johns  Now for my letter'Sdeath it's from my sweet little Mrs Wilkins  Reads  Mrs Wilkins's compliments to Mr Johnson will be glad of his company this evening to tea as she wishes to treat with him about those little matters he brought with him from India if the two sets of China be as handsome as he said they were she will take them both off his hands she'll take besides some chintz and muslins for gowns and half a dozen shawls he need not send her any mandarins she has more old figures than is worth house room  P S Mr Wilkins is very sorry he can't be at home the whole evening very particular business calling him to Hogsden  I was afraid I shou'd have had no postscript but all's right I findYes my sweet Mrs Wilkins I will go and talk to you about those trifles I brought with me from India but you shall have no mandarinsindeed I thought you had one too many of these old figures  Exit  Enter  Caleb  followed by  Charlotte  Ca  Well Miss how do you like me Don't you think I look like a captain  Char  Like a captain It wou'd be doing you injustice to compare you to any one officer under His Majesty I am really at a loss for a comparison to match you withCome turn about and let me see your shapesMercy what a long sword they have tied you to  Ca  That was all my own thought I haven't learnt to sence yet and as I am told a gentleman is nobody till he has fought about a score duels I was determined the first time I fought not to be overreach'd by any body  Char  A very prudent resolution I must confess valour is by no means incompatible with discretion but pray Sir are you so very quarrel some that you expect to have all those duels upon your hands  Ca  Me quarrelsomeBless your heart I'm as quiet as a lamb  Char  Then why do you expect to fight so much  Ca  Because it's the fashion and you know a man had better be out of the world than out of the fashion  Char  Then I think you are taking an excellent method to have your choice  Ca  Yes fighting's quite a gentlemanlike amusementbesides it will be put in the newspapers and I shall read my own name in print along with the debates of Lords and Commons and that's the cause I suppose of all duels  Char  I believe duels have been fought more than onceand oh fatal delusion perhaps a valuable life lost for a cause altogether as frivolous  Ca  But now I am dress'd do you see me I wish to shew myself to some of my old acquaintances therefore suppose you and I go this evening to Bagnigge Wells and drink teathe hot rolls are so nice there you can't think  Char  Some other time I can't possibly go this evening  Ca  Mayhap you think I won't pay for the tea but I will and moreover than that I'll treat you to the halfplay afterwards  Char  You must indeed excuse me Sir  Aside  I wish I cou'd get rid of himThis moment poor Crevelt pass'd me with a dejected airI follow'd him with a stol'n glance till I trac'd him into the libraryI wish I knew what was the matter with him I never saw a man in my life I pity so much  Ca  Looking at himself  How they'd stare at our hop to see me in this dress  Char  This fellow takes no notice of me his regimentals have actually rivall'd me  Ca  With great delight  Dress I see is every thing such a suit of regimentals wou'd make any man a great officerHow this world goes fine fellows are made by taylors and taylors undone by fine fellows  Char  My Narcissus is so engag'd with his person it wou'd be foolish to lose this opportunity of getting rid of him I'll drop carelessly into the libraryI never saw so sudden an alteration in a man's looks as in poor Crevelt's I hope he's not in lovePoor Charlotte if the object be not in England    Exit  Char  Ca  To himself  To be sure Caleb you haven't a pair of legsIt is not every Captain who can beat a march with such a pair of drumsticksI wonder how my legs would look in a pair of new bootsI never rode of a Sunday but in a pair of my father's old onesMost smart captains I observe foot as well as horse mount the streets in bootsSo you won't go to Bagnigge Wells  Looking up  Eh why she's goneEcod I'm glad of itand now the coast is clear I'll have a rambleWhat signifies my being dress'd if nobody sees meI'll call over to Jacob Wilkins's and take a glass with him Who knows but one of these days when I return  from abroad a great warrior but old Jacob may take down his sign and hang me up over his door  Exit  Enter Lady  Oldstock  and Count  Pierpoint  La O  Really my Lord I tremble for the consequences of this interview if Sir Oliver shou'd meet us and happen to be in one of his jealous moods it is in vain to tell him of the innocency of our conversation he will interpret my very looks and draw the strangest inferences from even the tone

delight in thinking for ourselvesopposition is the very soul of an Englishmanhe likes it in himself and in others also peace and prosperity with good eating and drinking would throw him into a

French nabob for my niece now it would be a master stroke if I cou'd obtain the English one for my daughter and thus center the two nabobs in my own family This son of the Colonel's is a down right savage Charlotte never cou'd like him or if she cou'd interest tells me I shou'd not therefore her liking's out of the question there's to be a division of the Colonel's property between the son and Mandeville I want the whole if possible The Colonel's not fifty and in my mind he's a better looking man than either his son or his nephew Charlotte's having ten thousand pounds independent of me makes her very obstinate debates will run high I fear as indeed they very often do in my family where tho' I'm constantly left in a minority I never lose a question'tis true I have open mouths upon me from all sides till like greater men I'm fairly badger'd but it's only waiting till the strangers are all out and I tell the house  as I please afterwardsZoonds here comes Mandeville I wish I cou'd get decently out of his way  Enter  Mandeville  Man  I have been in search of you Sir Oliver  Sir O  I wish I had known that I'd have sav'd you a good deal of troubleWell my good Sir had you any thing particular to say to me  Man  Is your conduct towards me consistent with honour  Sir O  I don't understand you  Man  How convenient it is to assume ignorance of a subject on which it is painful to hear the truth even to the man incapable of respecting it Honour tho' shut out from the heart will still knock at its gates and tell the guilty there' is a register kept in the avenging court of remorse for every act of injustice  Sir O  Upon my word Mr Mandeville you speak to me in a very strange stile this is not a manner in which I am accustom'd to be address'd You bounce in all of a sudden transported with rage for what cause is best known to yourself and with a knockmedown countenance treat me as if my age and my rank had no kind of respect due to them  Man  Sir no man honours age more than I or more readily yields rank every respect it can claim when that rank does not forfeit its title to esteem by meanly sinking and degrading itselfbut when men in superior stations behave as if their actions were above all censure and control they must be told that they are deceiving themselves as well as the world and that no man is suffer'd to injure another with impunity  Sir O  Well Sir in what particular have I injur'd  you to provoke the thunder of this terrible Phillipic  Man  Can you seriously ask me that question when you sanction the addresses of Count Pierpoint to your niece  Sir O  Well and what then  Man  Have you forgot your prior engagement to me  Sir O  Mr Mandeville the poet says that "Every day's a satire on the last" now I say that every day's a contradiction to the last as circumstances vary or events fall out we are compelled by necessity to change our minds As to my niece whom I consider in the light of a daughter I think it my duty in providing her with a husband to make the best bargain I can for her  Man  Sir have you no regard to what the world will say on this occasion The world Sir that harsh blind misjudging multitude whose slander if it soil the ermine purity of virtue what will it say when it has justice upon its side  Sir O  Nothing that I valueYoung man when you have lived as many years with the world as I have you'll learn to make your happiness independent of its opinionDon't you see knaves and fools every day rise into consequence and all from the opinion of the worldthe opinion of the world Sir It's a mouthful of moonshine  Man  I believe with you that the world is too indolenttoo much occupied with its pleasures or its miseries to take up the business of a censorI fear it never examines thoroughly any man's pretensions to its favour the more he asks the more he generally obtains from the world hence folly confidence and vice revel in the arms of luxury whilst merit proud and retiring from the conscious dignity of genius and virtue is suffer'd to perish for want of breadBut Sir  Sir O  But me no more this debate Mr Mandevillethe question is put and I am going Partial as I am to a polemical mode of discourse I find that there may be sometimes even too much contradiction  Exit  Man  What shall I do with this deceitful unfeeling man But can I hesitate whilst I have a particle of spirit left I'll go this moment state the matter to Count Pierpoint and he shall resign or fight for his mistress  Enter  Harriet  Har  Dear Mandeville what is the matter My uncle has just parted from you seemingly much out of temper and the wildness and disorder of your looks terrify me  Man  My heart is torn to pieces HarrietIndignation at the ungenerous treatment I have met with from your uncle added to my fears of losing you distract me  Har  But can you doubt your Harriet There is no power upon earth shall force me to be another's do then dear Mandeville strive to calm this tumult in your mindBetrayed by the violence of your passion you talk'd of going in search of Count Pierpointlet me beseech you not  Man  You were deceived Harrier in what you heard me saydo not prevent my goingI have business of a most particular nature calls me  Har  I know perfectly the business that calls youbut let me conjure you by all that regard you ever profess'd for me not to think of itYou say your fears of losing me distract youjudge then of the state of my heart by your ownHas Harriet no fears for her Mandeville at a moment she sees him eat up with an ungovernable rage  about perhaps to hurry himself or a fellowcreature into eternity  Man  Your apprehensions Harriet are groundlessfrom what I learn of the Count's character I believe him to be a man of too nice honour too equitable too generous to reduce me to the necessity of proceeding to extremities I only wish to explain matters to him  Har  I can recommend a much better course to you and one much more likely to succeedGo to your uncle that good that noblehearted man tell him your storyif any body has weight with Sir Oliver it is Colonel Talbot  Man  Nobody has weight with him when avarice claims his ear  Har  You are mistaken he is not so great a slave to avarice as you suppose him  Man  He is your uncle Harriet and I cannot speak of him with harshness  Har  I know by your eyes you are not so angry as you were  Man  I will be guided by you in every thingThere is a fascinating power Harriet in your looks and accents when you wou'd persuade that cannot be resisted a melting softness clings about my heart as I listen and behold you there is sure a divinity in angelbeauty You caused the tempest in my soul and have calm'd it  Exeunt  End of the Third Act  ACT IV  SCENE  An Apartment at  Mandeville's  Caleb

Library  Crevelt  seated with a Book  Crevelt  Throws the Book down  It is to no purposeI cannot readThis adorable girl has taken such entire possession of my mind it has'nt room for any other object when Mr Mandeville told me she was going to be married  and to whom my hope died within me for then I knew all hope was lost but grant there was no dishonour no ingratitude in harbouring a passion for a woman intended for the son of my benefactor how should a lowborn abject thing like me aspite to one so much above him Wou'd not my birth be an insurmountable bar to my hopes She comes this wayI would avoid her but have not the power  Enter  Charlotte  with a Volume of  Shakespeare  in her Hand  Char  Reading    She never told her love  But let concealment like a worm i'th'bud  Feed on her damask cheek she pin'd in thought  And with a green and yellow melancholy  She sat like Patience on a monument  Smiling at grief  Bless me Captain Crevelt  starting  I did'nt see youI was quite absorbed in poor Viola's melancholy relation of undivulged love this little picture is so highly finished so delicately coloured with touches of the true pathetic that I never read it without being wonderfully affectedDon't you think it one of the finest passages in all Shakespeare  Crev  I so much admire it Madam that I would give the world this moment for the pencil of its immortal writer to paint one of our sex in the same state of uncomplaining despondency  Char  I protest you spoke those last words with so serious an air that I'm half inclined to think you're in love yourself if that be the case come make me your confidante I'll be as secret and as silent as Shakespeare's own marble Grief and Patience I have the music of the Avon swan this moment at my heart and cou'd hear a lover whisper his tale under a tree in which the  nightingale sung and the moon tipt its boughs with silver  Crev  You speak Madam like one well vers'd in the passion  Char  And is that strange Sir when I come with Shakespeare in my hand a master who teaches the whole history of the passions His keen and ardent eye in a fine frenzy rolling pierced into the secret chambers of the heart where the passions slumber and woke them as he swept his lyre divine to all their changeful moods of pain and joy till kindled up to madness or to ecstasy but when he touches upon love though the flash be momentary it resembles lightning suddenly rifting the surface of the earth and disclosing the radiant portal of a diamond quarry  Crev  Were I to wish another laurel on the grave of Shakespeare it should be planted by the hand of so charming a commentator  Char  Sir there is a laurel already planted on his grave by one of our sex which will flourish till the spirit of his genius and his writings are no more rememberedbut to the pointI have pronoune'd you in love now let me know who your mistress is  Crev  Madam I dare not  Char  Dare not Is that a soldier's phrase Courage man there is nothing impossible to spirit and perseverance besides the more difficulties lay in the road to your mistress the better she'll like you for surmounting them  Crev  But suppose there was a difficulty not to be surmounted  Char  If your mistress does not dislike you I now of no other difficulty which is not to be surmounted  Crev  But even presuming that were the case which I have by no means reason to imagine I cannot think of her without condemning myself  Char  Is she so much beneath you  Crev  She's above my praise and above my hopes  Char  If she deserves all this adoration she never will think herself above a man of merit  Crev  Then Madam you don't think marrying for love entirely out of fashion  Char  I never would marry for any thing else  Crev  Aside  Then I'm undone she loves the man for whom she is intended and the assurance of that I have now received from her own lips was meant as a reproach to a passion she has discovered in spite of all my efforts to conceal it  Char  Seeing his disorder  What's the matter Sir  Crev  I fear Madam I only interrupt your studies  Going  Char  How can you talk so I don't know any one whose conversation on so short an acquaintance is so agreeable to me this last has been particularly interesting  Crev  It is plain from the sarcasm of that reply that she understands mebut I am justly punished for my apostacy to honour in daring to think of her  Aside  Char  He appears confused and embarrassed all of a sudden I fear my vanity has betrayed me too far and that I have been mistaken in the object of his affections  Aside  Crev  I have not power to speak to her  Aside  Char  No no I'm not the object  Aside  Enter a Servant  Serv  Sir the Colonel wishes to see you immediately  Crev  What a release from torture  Aside  I shall wait on him  Exit Servant  Madam your most obedient  Exit  Manet  Charlotte  Char  So I have as good as told a man I like him who it is plain is in love with another woman unhappy Charlotte  Enter Sir  Oliver  Speaks as he comes on  Sir O  Charlotte  Char  Sir  Sir O  Sir How melancholy a monosyllable comes from a woman's mouth it sounds as dismal as a single bell after a full peal But Charlotte what's the matter I never saw you so thoughtful before I hope it is not your marriage that makes you uneasy  Char  It never gave me an uneasy moment I had made up my mind on the subject  Sir O  Well well let the matter rest then however I must confess I should like to see my girl well married and settled before I left the world  Char  I don't think I shall ever marry  Sir O  Never marry  Char  No  Sir O  Confound those monosyllables Charlotte let me have no more of them the laconic style does not become you I wonder from whom you take it for my part I'm fond of the figure of amplification in discourse and I'm sure your mother deals in an eloquence copious at times even to redundancy  Char  Sir I have not spirits for conversation  Sir O  I am surprised at that when you have every thing your own way you won't marry this body nor you won't marry t'other and I like  an easy indulgent old soul humour you in every thing fond as I am of contradiction  Char  Hav'nt you all's one as held me up to sale to the highest bidderI was first intended for Mr Mandeville next destined to Colonel Talbot's newfound heir  Sir O  His newfound bear you shou'd say but Charlotte Charlotte how uncandid you are when I proposed the last match I had not seen the man  Char  Sir you change your mind so often and band me about in so extraordinary a manner that I shall become a topic for public ridicule  Sir O  Well and if I do change my mind often isn't it for your good As one project starts up in my mind better than another in order to take advantage of that I must naturally contradict myself The Spanish proverb says a wise man often changes his mind a fool never  Char  According to that proverb you should be a second Solomon who you intend for me next I cannot possibly guess but as I never will marry without your consent I trust it will not be deemed undutiful if I always retain a negative to myself in a matter which so nearly concerns my happiness as the choice of a husband  Exit  Sir O  I fear like all great projectors and politicians I resine too much I spin the wires that compose my nets so fine that though they answer the purpose of deceiving the eye when their strength is tried a touch breaks themWhat's to be done she actually sets my authority at defiance but this comes of rich uncles leaving fat legacies to their nieces it converts a father into a cypher  Enter Lady  Oldstock  and  Harriet  Lady O  Sir Oliver Sir Oliver the whole world is condemning you  Sir O  So much the better a quarter of the world never was right but the whole is always wrong you have brought me this good news I suppose knowing I was out of spirits  Har  To contract for me without my knowledge and with an utter stranger too as if I had not the common privilege of a thinking rational creature  Sir O  Ecod I think you have too much of that privilege why you ungrateful minx do you fly in my face for endeavouring to get a count for you  Lady O  A count A strange kind of countthe fellow made love to me  Sir O  Then indeed must he be a strange kind of count  Lady O  I shall sue for a separate maintenance  Har  And I shall sue for the little property my father left in his hands  Sir O  Damn it since you have begun come fire away from both sides volley after volley don't spare me I'll make you raise the siege at last contradiction's my element as fire is the Salamander's I can't have too much of it my opinion is impregnable  Har  It's in vain to speak to him  Lady O  Speak to him child now he's in all his glory  Sir O  Hobbs maintains that the whole world is in a state of warfare and I believe him  Speaking to himself  Lady O  I say Sir Oliver are you deaf  Sir O  But it is a wise law in nature  Har  Dear uncle will you listen to me  Sir O  Opposition calls forth the latent powers of the mind  La O  Was there ever any thing so provoking  Sir O  Your greatest men have been form'd by difficulties  Har  Every moment is big with danger to my happiness  Sir O  Methinks I now resemble the memorable column of English infantry at Fontenoy marching down between two forts with all their batteries playing upon it whiz fly the small shot from the left and bang go the great guns from the right but on we march firm as a wedge without confusion without disorder without dismay and quit the field of battle with honour  Exit  Har  My principal fear is a quarrel between Count Pierpoint and Mr Mandeville  La O  You had better speak to his friend Captain Crevelt for my part I have no influence with the Count  Har  Dear aunt how can you talk thus So fine a woman will never lose her influence  La O  Pray Harriet have you ever read that elegant fellow St Everemond's account of the lovely Ninon She who retain'd her beauty and power of fascination to the age of eighty  Har  I have never read St Everemond Madam  La O  Then you have read nothing he was the intimate friend of Fontaine Racine and Corneille all the great men of his time valued his friendship but what most endears him to me was his esteem for the lovely NinonI shall never forget one of her letters in which she mentions he first wearing spectacles but said that charming woman as I had always a grave look spectacle become me  Har  I declare aunt I have always thought th  same of you when I have seen you with your spectacles on  La O  But you're mistaken Harriet if you suppose I wear spectacles from any necessity I have for themI wear them by way of prevention  Har  As I hope to live here comes the Count he'll teaze me to death if I stayI never saw you look so well aunt  La O  You may go Harriet and find Captain CreveltI'll once more try my influence with this Frenchman    Exit  Harriet  Enter Count  Pierpoint  La O  Well Count I hope you have chang'd your opinion since our last conversation and that you're become a little more Anglicised  Count  Eh bien Madam je ne puis pas comprendre I no understand  La O  Why we have chang'd characters you can't understand me now and I cou'dn't understand you before but Count I'd advise you to consider you are in England and tho' it may be the etiquette in France to treat a married lady with as much attention as a single it is in this country of jealous circumspection very dangerous it is almost sufficient to cause a separation  Count  Ah Madam have a some pity on those whom your charms enslave quand I'amour est dans le coeur il fait l'esprit comme lui même dat is ven love is in de heart he make a dey understand blind as himself by Gar  La O  The French are certainly the most agreeable people in the world if they transgress they make reparation with so good a grace that it's delightful to be on good or bad terms with them  Count  I made von grand faux pas but like good general me vill profit by my loss  Aside  Madam  Oldstock is vat you call von grand bastion or outwork I will take a that first la petite citadel Mademoiselle Harriet follow of course by Gar  La O  Well Count I forgive you but it's on condition that you are more circumspect in future  Enter Sir  Oliver  at the Back of the Stage  Sir O  If I cou'd lay my hand on Burn's Justice in the library that wou'd set me right but I think it's a question for gentlemen of the common lawEh what's all this  Seeing the Count and Lady O  Count  Madam permettez moi baiser votte main I must kiss a your von pretty hand in sign of reconciliation  Kissing her hand  Sir O  I was thinking of the common law but here promises to arise a question for gentlemen of the civil law  La O  Jealousy Count is a tree of English growth  Sir O  It may be a tree of English growth but it's a tree would never flourish if a taste for French gardening did not so often make the branches sprout  Count  Mon Dieu quelle grand disproportion in your age and the Chevalier Oldstock  La O  When a woman marries very young my Lord a dozen years difference is nothing in the age of a husband  Sir O  A dozen years Damme if there's a dozen months between us  Lady O  That's a most beautiful brilliant Count on your fingerI think I never saw so large a one the rich cluster of its rays cast a light actually celestial  Sir O  If that poor diamond cou'ds peak now  perhaps we'd find it was not very celestially come by  Count  To reconcile me complete permettez moi to make you von present  La O  Dear Count I cannot think of accepting a ring of such immense valueNo no Count I am not such an infant as to wish to possess every thing that I admire  Sir O  No to be sure you an'tWhy Count how is all this  Coming forward  La O  Oh heavens Sir Oliver  Sir O  Yes my Lady does the great disproportion of our years frighten you  Count  Upon my vord Monsieur Oldstock this is not behave with your usual politesse  Sir O  Why what the devil man aren't you content with one of my chickens but you must have my old hen into the bargain  La O  Old hen  Sir O  Yes my Lady when I had you first you were no pullet  La O  Now there will be no end to his suspicions  Sir O  Ecod I think this is putting suspicion out of the questionWell my Lady what have you to say for yourself You ask'd me if I wasn't deaf now are you dumbDamn it say something if it's only to contradict me  Count  Monsieur Oldstock je suisI am your very good friend  Sir O  You are Count and what's more I find you're my wife's friend  La O  Sir Oliver conscious as I am of the purity of my thoughts I cou'd look down with contempt on every extravagance to which your jealous temper hurries you but when I consider how the fairest reputations are every day injur'd from the  slightest foundationsif it shou'd creep into the public prints  Sir O  Then I'll give you a little comfortnobody will believe it  La O  The cool malignity of his temper is even more provoking than his jealousyI can't bear to have been all my life reproach'd for nothing  Exit  Count  Monsieur Oldstock  Sir O  Count Pierpoint no apologies I am not at all angry with you nor do I entertain any suspicion of my wifeLove of admiration is her ruling passion and as long as she lives she'll fancy herself an object of that admiration  Count  Vous savez trés bien my passion pour Mademoiselle Harriet  Sir O  I know every thingI now see your view in all this attention to Lady Oldstock you imprudently made her your enemy not knowing her character but you have very wisely rectified your mistakeYou see Count I'm a keen old fellow I haven't liv'd for nothing so many years in the world  Count  Mon Dieu vous etes un Machiavel  Sir O  Come along CountBut before you go how do you think your friend Colonel Talbot stands affected as to matrimony Do you imagine if a fine girl was thrown in his way that he'd marry her  Count  Nothing more like on my vord il est un homme de gallantrie sans dout he has a de son if dat be no objection  Sir O  Objection he shou'd marry for that very reason and get more sons if it was only to convince the world that he has mended his hand in the business  Exeunt  End of the Fourth Act  ACT V  SCENE  continues at  Mandeville's  Enter  Harriet  and  Charlotte  Harriet  I AM half in love with Count Pierpoint for his noble behaviourThe moment matters were properly explain'd to him he withdrew his claim instantlyWell I never more will hear the French spoken ill of they carry the point of honour to a pitch of heroismbut Charlotte what is the matter Your spirits are intolerably depressed  Char  You only fancy so from the unusual gaiety of your own  Har  I have a great mind to send Captain Crevelt to you you are just fit company for each other two moping melancholy fools  Char  From some conversation I have had with him I take it that he is in love  Har  And I fancy I have a fair friend much in the same situation  Char  He leaves town to day  Har  Unless you issue your sovereign commands to the contrary  Char  My sovereign commands How you trifle what influence have I over him  Har  That influence which a beautiful woman will always have over a man of exquisite sensibilityMandeville told me he was eternally talking of you  Char  Talking of me Lord I wonder what the man can have to say about me  Har  Oh a thousand handsome things I dare  say but if you wish to be satisfied as to the particulars you may have them from the gentleman's own mouth for here he comes so I'll leave you together  Char  Then you will be so ill natured  Har  Good natured sweet cousin  Exit  Char  Eternally talking of me Whence then arose his sudden coldness and reserve when I but too plainly discovered my partiality for him Yet I may have been mistaken a mind possessed of so much delicacy as his might have deemed it criminal to address me on the score of love at a time h  thought I was intended for the son of his friend Colonel Talbotit is it must be sothe pulses o  my heart quicken at the thoughtbut he's here  Enter  Crevelt  Crev  Miss Oldstock as I mean to quit tow this evening and possibly may never see you again I am come to solicit the honour of a few minute conversation  Char  Never see me again I hope you are no going back to India  Crev  No Madam that is not my intention  Char  Oh then I understand you it is th  compound of every female excellence of who you spoke to me in such raptures who is the cau  of your leaving us  Crev  I own it Madam  Char  But you talk'd of never seeing me again is your mistress that jealous creature as to exa  such a promise from you  Crev  No Madam that is a punishment I v  +luntarily inflict upon myself  Char  You do say the most gallant things wi  the most sombre countenance your wit and yo  face Captain Crevelt are the diamond and  soil the dark shade of the one lends a more vivid glow to the other's sparkling brilliancywhat an alteration the presence of your mistress wou'd make in your looks Cou'd you look thus in her presence  Crev  In the present state of my heart I could hot look otherwise  Char  No not if she smil'd upon you  Crev  A smile from her wou'd raise me from despair but that MadamConfusion yonder I see Colonel Talbot this is the second time to day he has found me in earnest conversation with her  Char  I didn't think it possible till now Colonel Talbot cou'd put me out of temper  Crev  Will he not suspect that I am meanly stealing myself upon her affections and attribute her dislike of his son to meBut he comes I cannot meet his eye in the present state of my feelingsAdieu dear Miss Oldstock  Char  But are we never to meet again  Crev  It is a sacrifice Madam that pierces and widows my heart for ever but honour and gratitude demand it  Exit  Enter Colonel  Talbot  Col  Wasn't that Captain Crevelt Miss Oldstock that parted from you  Char  Yes Sir he has just taken his leave of me and said I shall never see him again  Col  There is a resinement in Crevelt's temper that to strangers makes his conduct at times appear very unaccountable but I fancy I have discovered the cause of this extraordinary resolution  Char  And sure Sir you can prevail upon him to alter it  Col  Then my lovely girl wishes he should alter his resolution  Char  Oh Sir is it possible to be acquainted with so noble so accomplish'd so brave a youth and not esteem him Never see me more  Col  It is as I suspected and indeed as I wish for who but Crevelt is worthy of such a woman  Aside  I hope Miss Oldstock you are now perfectly convinced that I wou'd not purchase the greatest earthly happiness at the price of your peace of mindhighly as my pride and natural affection wou'd be gratified to call you daughter I trust I can turn my eye with manly firmness from the bright the flattering prospect and resign'd to the dispensations of a Power who never afflicts his creature but for wise and good purposes point out a man in every respect but birth and fortune deserving of you  Char  Birth and fortune Colonel despicable distinctions when nature asserts her superior claims to reverence by ennobling the spirit how low it lays the insolence of ancestry and humbles the vanity of wealth  Col  Madam your words penetrate my very soul with an aching joyless heart I look back to those imaginary scenes of happiness fancy had painted in meeting with a son the only pledge of love from the first object of my affections and whose image still warms this desolated bosomBirth when I survey my own offspring and behold poor Crevelt I am asham'd to think so empty a thing as family pride had ever any insluence over me  Char  But you will prevail upon him to alter his resolution  Col  On one condition Madam  Char  What is that Colonel  Cat  That you will receive him as my adopted  sonYour father's objections I will remove by making him your equal in fortune  Char  I don't know how to thank you Colonel but perhaps he's already gone  Col  Gone without seeing me first impossibleBut what says my sweet girl to the proposal I have made her  Char  You are so good so disinterested and so generous that it is impossible not to acquiesce in any proposal of your's but yet I will not make you an absolute promise mind that Colonel till I find you have effectually accomplished my request and induced Captain Crevelt to alter his resolution  Exit  Col  Luckily Sir Oliver has taken a very great liking to him and told me that he wou'd insist upon his passing a few days at his house previous to visiting his relationsTho' Crevelt possesses the spirit of a lion there is a gentleness and flexibility in his nature which cannot resist solicitation from a friendOh my heart be still tho' I am denied happiness in that quarter whence I fondly expected it let me enjoy it as Heaven thinks proper to bestow the boon by exerting my best efforts to impart it to the truly deserving  Enter Count and  Mandeville  Count  J'espere Monsieur Mandeville you are perfectly satisfysur mon honneur had I know Mademoiselle Harriet was engagé I never wou'd pay l'addresse  Mand  I believe it Count and hope you will forgive the warmth I was at first betrayed into  Count  Mon Dieu il est l'evervescence d'un grande ame no brave man ever resign sa maitresse avec sang froid  Lol  Now Mandeville to completely remove  your fears in regard to Harriet know I have made your peace with her unclewou'd you believe it he actually proposed his daughter to mehowever by the dint of argument added to the influence of an old friendship I at last brought him to reason  Enter Sir  Qliver  Sir O  Colonel Colonel is this strict observance of treaty the carriages are waiting for us at the doorwere we not all to set off for my house immediately did you not promise to pass ten days with me when you had contradicted me into consent at last  Court  Monsieur Oldstock your niece was very pretty to be sure mais mon Dieu votre fille be very pretty aussi me understand she

time I have taken such a liking todamn me if you have not a fine roastbeef countenance  Col  I fancy Count that lady's affections are also engaged  Count  Je suis trés malheureux all de English lady be engaged but me be not surprized for if de foreigner set so much value on de English lady vat must their own countrymen who know them better do  Sir O  Why what the deuce Colonel is all this You won't marry my daughter yourself you won't suffer your son whatever her inclinations may be to marry her and now you put the Count against her  Col  Will you leave the lady to her own choice  Sir O  The worst of it is I must do thatCount a word in your earto her yourselfyou're a dev'lish straight well looking fellow no appearance of frogs about you except upon your coatI shou'd like to see an union between France and England if it were only because it has been so long thought a contradiction in politics  Col  How unsubstantial are all the prospects of man in whatever hope flatters him with happinessthis unhappy boy distracts me  Sir O  Damn me if I wou'dn't send him down into Wales or Yorkshirefor about fifteen pounds a year you may get him decently boarded and clad and educated into the bargain  Enter a Servant  Serv  I have been in search of Mr Talbot Sir since you spoke to me and have just heard that he is gone to one Jacob Wilkins's an innkeeper near Smithfield  Col  I am

put up your sword and I'll tell you every thingWhat she says is partly true your son strayed from me when he was about twelve years old but had he been my own I cou'dn't have used him better as a proof of it his mother in her last illness came as she often did privately to see him and was so well pleased with my wife's and my treatment of her son that she gave me a fiftypound Bank noteI shall never forget the day it was the last time I ever saw her she hung a small picture of herself set in gold about the child's neck and wept bitterly over him  Col  Can you produce that picture  Wil  Your son took it with him he was so fond of it I cou'd never keep it out of his hands but by locking it up which I sometimes did as  the severest of all punishments I cou'd inflict upon him  Col  I must have better proof this tale is true before I let you escape that justice I fear is due to your wickednessJohnson take him from my sight and let him be secur'd I cannot bear to look at him Tell the

houseHe says my poor child stray'd from him when a boy but this tale is so improbable that I rather fear he has fall'n a victim to this fellow's villany and avarice  Crev  Dear Sir compose yourself and hope human nature cannot be so deprav'd it wrings my heart to see you in this distressBut who is this villain  Col  His name is WilkinsWhen I committed my child to his care he lived at Henly he pretends he lost him at twelve years old and oh agony to think if he indeed be living he is at this moment a wandering outcast and a beggar  Crev  Merciful heaven What do I hear Can  it be possible

Siryour happy son that son you lost  Col  You You Crevelt  Crev  Yes Sir the veteran whose name I bear took me with him at the age you mention from Henly where I lived with the man you have just named whom I always thought my father it was the pride of poor Crevelt's heart to have me believed his son I bore his name and publicly acknowledged him as my father for you Sir could not have lov'd me better his dying request to me was still to retain the name of Crevelt and never forget the man who made me a soldier  Col  My son my son The hand of Providence has surely directed every circumstance of your life you were brought to me a stranger and a child I became your parent by resistless instinct in battle once I owed my life to you and now a second time you save it  Char  O Harriet There is

fellow for youforgets he is talking to a captain  Col  That is a rank you are so utterly unfit for that it would only expose you to unhappiness and ridicule therefore your commission shall be sold and for being one day my son the purchase money shall be appropriated to setting you up in business  Johns  Well what keeps you now  Ca  You are in a devil of a hurry Mr Johnson I find I must put up with old Jacob again but let me ask you one question an't I to be entitled to halfpay for my services  Johns  You shall have full pay if you do'nt go about your business  Shakes his cane at him  Ca  Well

this wayDo give my wife a kiss I know my dear your lips itch for it and with all her faults believe me she has a heart that beats in unison to the feelings of all present and a tear for misery and friendship  Col Tal  Miss Oldstock it is your father's wish and mine to unite our familiesnow that I have a son I can propose to you there is only your acceptance of him necessary to make me happy  Char  Why Sir if the gentleman has but courage to speak for himself  Sir O  As I don't expect the pleasure of contradiction from either party on this occasion I'll join their hands  Joining their hands  without waiting for an answerthereColonel you are now one of my family  Col Tal  That assurance Sir Oliver seals and completes my happinessyou Mandeville shall share a portion of my fortune as a son and may happiness still wait on you and your lovely Harriotand now  Addressing the audience  if this courtmartial to whom we appeal acquit us with honour I shall bless the hour my boy said "He would be a Soldier"  FINIS  EPILOGUE  WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR OF THE COMEDY AND SPOKEN BY MRS POPE  NOW critic Jove the scale aloft suspends  On whose dread beam the poet's fate depends  Ye gods above high arbiters of wit  Who on your shilling thrones in council sit  You I implore for our poor bard afraid  To grant celestial uppergall'ry aid  If you approve with Cato I shall cry  The gods take care of poets in the sky  As for the ladiesthey'll sure hear my pray'r  New charms goodnature lends the fairest fair  Besides I hardly think they can be foes  To a fond maid who a brave soldier chose  Who like a soldier charms the fair one's eyes  The queen of beauty was a soldier's prize  In love as war the brave man best succeeds  Our sex reveres that valour which it needs  Ye beaux so finely waisted nowadays  That one wou'd almost swear you put on stays  You I confess create no great alarm  You hav'nt spirit to do good or harm  But yonder I espy some dangerous faces  Good critics I entreat your favouring graces  All I request is when a fault's set down  Its neighbouring beauty may be told the town  But after this if you attempt to growl  I'll excommunicate you every soul  In my lawn sleeves and shirt I'll come so big  In every thing a bishop but his wig  Nay if you doubt an army I will bring  Of bishops who may crown the greatest king  Their sleeves of lawn the downwings of the dove  Their sash the cestus of the queen of love  With aid like this and aid you'll own divine  Who wou'd not think success were surely mine  In anxious hope I wait the dread decree  That must be final both to bard and me
