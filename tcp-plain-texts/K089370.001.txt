the YOUTH of BOTH SEXES  A Narrative which has its Foundation in TRUTH and NATURE and at the same time that it agreeably entertains by a Variety of  curious  and  affecting  INCIDENTS is intirely divested of all those Images which in too many Pieces calculated for Amusement only tend to  inflame  the Minds they should  instruct    In Two VOLUMES  The THIRD EDITION To which are prefixed EXTRACTS from several curious LETTERS written to the  Editor  on the Subject  VOL I  LONDON  Printed for C RIVINGTON in  St Paul  's  ChurchYard  and J OSBORN in  Paternoster Row    M DCC XLI  PREFACE BY THE EDITOR  _IF to  Divert  and  Entertain  and at the same time to  Instruct  and  Improve  the Minds of the  YOUTH  of  both Sexes  IF to inculcate  Religion  and  Morality  in so easy and agreeable a manner as shall render them equally  delightful  and  profitable  to the  younger Class  of Readers as well as worthy of the Attention of Persons of  maturer  Years and Understandings  IF

 and to set  VIRTUE  in its own amiable Light to make it  truly Lovely  IF to draw Characters  justly  and to support them  equally  IF to raise a Distress from  natural  Causes and to excite Compassion from  proper  Motives  IF to teach the Man of  Fortune  how to  use  it the Man of  Passion  how to  subdue  it and the Man of  Intrigue  how gracefully and with Honour to himself to  reclaim  IF to give practical Examples worthy to be followed in the most  critical  and  affecting  Cases by the modest  Virgin  the chaste  Bride  and the obliging  Wife  IF toeffect all these good Ends in so probable so natural so  lively  a manner as shall engage the Passions of every sensible Reader and strongly interest them in the edifying Story  AND all without raising a  single Idea  throughout the Whole that shall shock the exactest Purity even in those tender Instances where the exactest Purity would be most apprehensive  IF these embellished with a great Variety of entertaining Incidents be laudable or worthy Recommendations of any Work the Editor of the following Letters which have their Foundation in  Truth  and  Nature  ventures to assert  that all these desirable Ends are obtained in these Sheets And as he is therefore confident of the favourable Reception which he boldly bespeaks for this little Work he thinks any  further Preface  or  Apology  for it unnecessary And the rather for two Reasons    st Because he can Appeal from  his own  Passions which have been uncommonly  moved  in perusing these engaging Scenes to the Passions of  Every one  who shall read them with the least Attention And in the next place because an  Editor  may reasonably be supposed to judge with an Impartiality which is rarely to be met with in an  Author  towards his own Works  The Editor  To the Editor of the Piece intitled  PAMELA  or  VIRTUE Rewarded    Dear SIR  I HAVE had inexpressible Pleasure in the Perusal of your PAMELA It intirely answers the Character you give of it in your Preface nor have you said one Word too much in Commendation of a Piece that has Advantages and Excellencies peculiar to itself For besides the beautiful Simplicity of the Style and a happy Propriety and Clearness of Expression the Letters being written under the immediate Impression of every Circumstance which occasioned them and that to those who had a Right to know the fair Writer's most secret Thoughts the several Passions of the Mind must of course be more affectingly described and Nature may be traced in her undisguised Inclinations with much more Propriety and Exactness than can possibly be found in a Detail of Actions long past which are never recollected with the same Affections Hopes and Dreads with which they were felt when they occurred  This little Book will infallibly be looked upon as the hitherto muchwanted Standard or Pattern for this Kind of Writing For it abounds with lively Images and Pictures with Incidents natural surprising and perfectly adapted to the Story with Circumstances interesting to Persons in common  Life as well as to those in exalted Stations The greatest Regard is every where paid in it to Decency and to every Duty of Life There is a constant Fitness of the Style to the Persons and Characters described Pleasure and Instruction here always go hand in hand Vice and Virtue are set in constant Opposition and Religion everywhere inculcated in its native Beauty and chearful Amiableness not dressed up in stiff melancholy or gloomy Forms on one hand nor yet on the other debased below its due Dignity and noble Requisites in Compliment to a too fashionable but depraved Taste And this I will boldly say that if its numerous Beauties are added to its excellent Tendency it will be found worthy a Place not only in all Families especially such as have in them young Persons of either Sex but in the Collections of the most curious and polite Readers For as it borrows none of its Excellencies from the romantic Flights of unnatural Fancy its being founded in Truth and Nature and built upon Experience will be a lasting Recommendation to the Discerning and Judicious while the agreeable Variety of Occurrences and Characters in which it abounds will not fail to engage the Attention of the gay and more sprightly Readers  The moral Reflections and Uses to be drawn from the several Parts of this admirable History are so happily deduced from a Croud of different Events and Characters in the Conclusion of the Work that I shall say the less on that Head But I think the Hints you have given me should also prefatorily be given to the Publick  viz  That it will appear from several Things mentioned in the Letters that the Story must have happened within these Thirty Years past That you have been obliged to vary some of the Names of Persons Places  c  and to disguise a few of the Circumstances in order to avoid giving Offence  to some Persons who would not chuse to be pointed out too plainly in it tho' they would be glad it may do the Good so laudably intended by the Publication And as you have in Confidence submitted to my Opinion some of those Variations I am much pleased that you have so managed the Matter as to make no Alteration in the Facts and at the same time have avoided the digressive Prolixity too frequently used on such Occasions  Little Book charming PAMELA face the World and never doubt of finding Friends and Admirers not only in thine own Country but far from Home where thou mayst give an Example of Purity to the Writers of a neighbouring Nation which now shall have an Opportunity to receive  English  Bullion in Exchange for its own Dross which has so long passed current among us in Pieces abounding with all the Levities of its volatile Inhabitants The reigning Depravity of the Times has yet left Virtue many Votaries Of their Protection you need not despair May every headstrong Libertine whose Hands you reach be reclaimed and every tempted Virgin who reads you imitate the Virtue and meet the Reward of the highmeriting tho' lowdescended PAMELA I am Sir  Your most Obedient and Faithful Servant  J B D F  To my worthy Friend the Editor of PAMELA  SIR  I RETURN the Manuscript of  Pamela  by the Bearer which I have read with a great deal of Pleasure It is written with that Spirit of Truth and agreeable Simplicity which tho' much wanted is seldom found in those Pieces which are calculated for the Entertainment and Instruction of the Publick It carries Conviction in every Part of it and the Incidents are so natural and interesting that I have gone handinhand and sympathiz'd with the pretty Heroine in all her Sufferings and been extremely anxious for her Safety under the Apprehensions of the bad Consequences which I expected every Page would ensue from the laudable Resistance she made I have interested myself in all her Schemes of Escape been alternately pleas'd and angry with her in her Restraint  pleas'd  with the little Machinations and Contrivances she set on foot for her Release and  angry  for suffering her Fears to defeat them always lamenting with a most sensible Concern the Miscarriages of her Hopes and Projects In short the whole is so affecting that there is no reading it without uncommon Concern and Emotion Thus far only as to the  Entertainment  it gives  As to  Instruction  and  Morality  the Piece is full of both It shews Virtue in the strongest Light and renders the Practice of it amiable and lovely  The beautiful Sufferer keeps it ever in her View without the least Ostentation or Pride she has it so strongly implanted in her that thro' the whole Course of her Sufferings she does not so much as hesitate once whether she shall sacrifice it to Liberty and Ambition or not but as if there were no other way to free and save herself carries on a determin'd Purpose to persevere in her Innocence and wade with it throughout all Difficulties and Temptations or perish under them It is an astonishing Matter and well worth our most serious Consideration that a young beautiful Girl in the low Scene of Life and Circumstance in which Fortune placed her without the Advantage of a Friend capable to relieve and protect her or any other Education than what occurr'd to her from her own Observation and little Reading in the Course of her Attendance on her excellent Mistress and Benefactress could after having a Taste of Ease and Plenty in a higher Sphere of Life than what she was born and first brought up in resolve to return to her primitive Poverty rather than give up her Innocence I say it is surprising that a young Person so circumstanced could in Contempt of proffer'd Grandeur on the one side and in Defiance of Penury on the other so happily and prudently conduct herself thro' such a Series of Perplexities and Troubles and withstand the alluring Baits and almost irresistible Offers of a fine Gentleman so universally admired and esteemed for the Agreeableness of his Person and good Qualities among all his Acquaintance defeat all his Measures with so much Address and oblige him at last to give over his vain Pursuit and sacrifice his Pride and Ambition to Virtue and become the Protector of that Innocence which he so long and so indefatigably labour'd to supplant And all this without ever having entertain'd the least previous  Design or Thought for that Purpose No Art used to inflame him no Coquetry practised to tempt or intice him and no Prudery or Affectation to tamper with his Passions but on the contrary artless and unpractised in the Wiles of the World all her Endeavours and even all her Wishes tended only to render herself as unamiable as she could in his Eyes Tho' at the same time she is so far from having any Aversion to his Person that she seems rather prepossess'd in his Favour and admires his Excellencies whilst she condemns his Passion for her A glorious Instance of Selfdenial Thus her very Repulses became Attractions The more she resisted the more she charm'd and the very Means she used to guard her Virtue the more endanger'd it by inflaming his Passions Till at last by Perseverance and a brave and resolute Defence the Besieged not only obtain'd a glorious Victory over the Besieger but took him Prisoner too  I am charmed with the beautiful Reflections she makes in the Course of her Distresses her Soliloquies and little Reasonings with herself are exceeding pretty and entertaining She pours out all her Soul in them before her Parents without Disguise so that one may judge of nay almost see the inmost Recesses of her Mind A pure clear Fountain of Truth and Innocence a Magazine of Virtue and unblemish'd Thoughts  I can't conceive why you should hesitate a Moment as to the Publication of this very natural and uncommon Piece I could wish to see it out in its own native Simplicity which will affect and please the Reader beyond all the Strokes of Oratory in the World for those will but spoil it and should you permit such a murdering Hand to be laid upon it to gloss and tinge it over with superfluous and needless Decorations which like too  much Drapery in Sculpture and Statuary will but encumber it it may disguise the Facts mar the Reflections and unnaturalize the Incidents so as to be lost in a Multiplicity of fine idle Words and Phrases and reduce our Sterling Substance into an empty Shadow or rather  frenchify  our  English  Solidity into Froth and Whipsyllabub No let us have  Pamela  as  Pamela  wrote it in her own Words without Amputation or Addition Produce her to us in her neat Country Apparel such as she appear'd in on her intended Departure to her Parents for such best becomes her Innocence and beautiful Simplicity Such a Dress will best edify and entertain The flowing Robes of Oratory may indeed amuse and amaze but will never strike the Mind with solid Attention  In short Sir a Piece of this Kind is much wanted in the World which is but too much as well as too early debauched by pernicious  Novels  I know nothing Entertaining of that Kind that one might venture to recommend to the Perusal much less the Imitation of the Youth of either Sex All that I have hitherto read tends only to corrupt their Principles mislead their Judgments and initiate them into Gallantry and loose Pleasures  Publish then this good this edifying and instructive little Piece for their sakes The Honour of  Pamela  's Sex demands  Pamela  at your Hands to shew the World an Heroine almost beyond Example in an unusual Scene of Life whom no Temptations or Sufferings could subdue It is a fine and glorious Original for the Fair to copy out and imitate Our own Sex too require it of you to free us in some measure from the Imputation of being incapable of the Impressions of Virtue and Honour and to shew the Ladies that we are not inflexible while they are so  In short the Cause of Virtue calls for the Publication of such a Piece as this Oblige then Sir the concurrent Voices of both Sexes and give us  Pamela  for the Benefit of Mankind And as I believe its Excellencies cannot be long unknown to the World and that there will not be a Family without it so I make no Doubt but every Family that has it will be much improv'd and better'd by it 'Twill form the tender Minds of  Youth  for the Reception and Practice of Virtue and Honour confirm and establish those of  maturer Years  on good and steady Principles reclaim the Vicious and mend the Age in general insomuch that as I doubt not  Pamela  will become the bright Example and Imitation of all the fashionable young Ladies of  Great Britain  so the truly generous Benefactor and Rewarder of her exemplary Virtue will be no less admired and imitated among the  Beau Monde  of our own Sex I am  Your affectionate Friend  c  INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION  _THE kind Reception which this Piece has met with from the Publick a large Impression having been carried off in less than Three Months deserves not only Acknowledgment but that some Notice should be taken of the Objections that have hitherto come to hand against a few Passages in it that so the Work may be rendered as unexceptionable as possible and of consequence the fitter to answer the general Design of it which is to promote Virtue and cultivate the Minds of the Youth of both Sexes  But Difficulties having arisen from the different Opinions of Gentlemen some of whom applauded the very Things that others found Fault with it was thought proper to submit the Whole to the Judgment of a Gentleman of the most distinguish'd Taste and Abilities the Result of which will be seen in the subsequent Pages  We begin with the following Letter at the Desire of several Gentlemen to whom on a very particular Occasion it was communicated and who wish'd to see it prefixed to the New Edition It was directed  To the Editor of  PAMELA    Dear Sir  YOU have agreeably deceiv'd me into a Surprize which it will be as hard to express as the Beauties of PAMELA Though I open'd this powerful little Piece with more Expectation than from common Designs of like Promise because it came from  your  Hands for my  Daughters  yet who could have dreamt he should find under the modest Disguise of a  Novel  all the  Soul  of Religion Goodbreeding Discretion Goodnature Wit Fancy Fine Thought and Morality I have done nothing but read it to others and hear others again read it to me ever since it came into my Hands and I find I am likely to do nothing else for I know not how long yet to come because if I lay the Book down it comes after meWhen it has dwelt all Day long upon the Ear It takes Possession all Night of the Fancy It has Witchcraft in every Page of it but it is the Witchcraft of Passion and Meaning Who is there that will not despise the false empty  Pomp  of the Poets when he observes in this little unpretending mild Triumph of  Nature  the whole Force of Invention and Genius creating new Powers of Emotion and transplanting  Ideas  of  Pleasure  into that unweeded low Garden the  Heart  from the dry and sharp  Summit  of  Reason  YET I confess there is  One  in the World of whom I think with still greater Respect than of PAMELA and That is of the wonderful AUTHOR of PAMELA Pray Who is he Dear Sir and where and how has he been able to hide hitherto such an encircling and allmastering Spirit He possesses every Quality that ART could have charm'd by yet has lent it to and conceal'd it in NATURE The Comprehensiveness of his Imagination must be truly prodigious It has stretch'd out this diminutive mere  Grain  of  Mustardseed  a poor Girl's little innocent Story into a Resemblance of That  Heaven  which the Best of Good Books has compar'd it to All the Passions are His in their most close and abstracted Recesses and by selecting the most delicate and yet at the same time most powerful of their Springs thereby to act wind and manage the Heart He  moves  us every where with the Force of a TRAGEDY  WHAT is there throughout the  Whole  that I do not sincerely admire I admire in it the strong distinguish'd Variety and picturesque glowing Likeness to  Life  of the Characters I know hear see and live among 'em All and if I cou'd paint cou'd return you their  Faces  I admire in it the noble Simplicity Force Aptness and Truth of so many modest oeconomical moral prudential religious satirical and cautionary  Lessons  which are introduc'd with such seasonable Dexterity and with so polish'd and exquisite a Delicacy of Expression and Sentiment that I am only apprehensive for the  Interests  of  Virtue  lest some of the  finest  and  most touching  of those  elegant Strokes of Goodbreeding Generosity and Reflection shou'd be lost under the too gross Discernment of an unfeeling Majority of Readers for whose Coarseness however they were kindly design'd as the most useful and charitable Correctives  ONE of the bestjudg'd Peculiars of the Plan is that These Instructions being convey'd as in a Kind of Dramatical Representation by those beautiful  Scenes  Her own Letters and Journals who acts the most moving and suffering  Part  we feel the Force in a threefold Effectfrom the Motive the Act and the Consequence  BUT what above All I am charm'd with is the amiable  Goodnature  of the AUTHOR who I am convinc'd has one of the best and most generous Hearts of Mankind because mismeasuring  other  Minds by  His Own  he can draw Every thing to Perfection but  Wickedness  I became inextricably in  Love  with this delightful Defect of his Malicefor I found it owing to an  Excess  in his  Honesty  Only observe Sir with what  virtuous Reluctance  he complies with the Demands of his Story when he stands in need of some blameable Characters Tho' his Judgment compels him to mark 'em with disagreeable Colourings so that they make an odious Appearance at first He can't forbear by an unexpected and gradual Decline from Themselves to soften and transmute all the Horror conceiv'd for their Baseness till we are arriv'd through insensible Stages at an Inclination to forgive it intirely  I MUST venture to add without mincing the matter what I really believe of this Book It will live on through Posterity with such unbounded Extent of Good Consequences that  Twenty Ages to come may be the Better and Wiser for its Influence It will steal first imperceptibly into the Hearts of the  Young  and the  Tender  where It will afterwards guide and moderate their Reflections and Resolves when grown Older And so a gradual moral Sunshine of unaustere and compassionate  Virtue  shall break out upon the  World  from this TRIFLE for such I dare answer for the  Author  His Modesty misguides him to think it No Applause therefore can be too  high  for  such Merit  And let me abominate the contemptible  Reserves of meanspirited Men  who while they but  hesitate  their Esteem with Restraint can be fluent and uncheck'd in their  Envy  In an Age so deficient in Goodness Every such Virtue as That of this Author is a salutary  Angel  in  Sodom  And  One  who cou'd stoop to conceal a Delight he receives from the  Worthy  wou'd be equally capable of submitting to an Approbation of the  Praise  of the  Wicked    I WAS thinking just now as I return'd from a  Walk  in the  Snow  on that  Old Roman Policy  of Exemptions in Favour of Men who had given a few bodily Children to the RepublickWhat superior Distinction ought  our  Country to find but that  Policy  and  We  are at Variance for Reward of this  Father of Millions of  MINDS which are to owe new Formation to the future Effect of his Influence  UPON the whole as I never met with so pleasing so honest and so truly deserving a Book I shou'd never have done if I explain'd All my Reasons for admiring its AuthorIf it is not a  Secret  oblige me so far as to tell me his  Name  for since I feel him the  Friend  of my Soul it would be a  Kind of Violation to retain him a  Stranger  I am not able to thank you enough for this highly acceptable Present And as for my Daughters They have taken into their Own Hands the Acknowledgment due from their Gratitude I am  DEAR SIR  Your  c  Dec  Abstract of a second Letter from the same Gentleman  'NO Sentiments which I have here or in my last express'd of the sweet  Pamela  being more than the bare Truth which every Man must feel who lends his Ear to the inchanting Prattler why does the Author's Modesty mislead his Judgment to suspect the Style wants Polishing No Sir there is an  Ease  a  natural Air  a dignify'd  Simplicity  and measured Fullness in it that resembling Life outglows it He has reconciled the  Pleasing  to the  Proper  The  Thought  is everywhere exactly  cloath'd  by the  Expression  And becomes its Dress as roundly and as close as  Pamela  her Countryhabit Remember tho' she put it on with humble Prospect of descending to the Level of her Purpose it  adorn'd  her with such unpresum'd  Increase  of Loveliness sat with such neat Propriety of Elegant Neglect about her that it threw out All her Charms with tenfold and resistless InfluenceAnd so dear Sir it will be always foundWhen modest Beauty seeks to hide itself by casting off the  Pride  of  Ornament  it but displays itself without a  Covering  And so becoming more distinguished by its Want of  Drapery  grows  stronger  from its  purpos'd Weakness  '  There were formed by an anonymous Gentleman the following Objections to some Passages in the Work  That the Style ought to be a little raised at least so soon as  Pamela  knows the Gentleman's Love is honourable and when his Diffidence is changed to Ease And from about the fourth Day after Marriage it should be equal to the Rank she is rais'd to and charged to fill becomingly  That to avoid the Idea apt to be join'd with the Word '  Squire  the Gentleman should be styled Sir  James  or Sir  John  c and Lady  Davers  in a new Edition might procure for him the Title of a Baronet  That if the sacred Name were seldomer repeated it would be better for that the Wise Man's Advice is  Be not righteous overmuch  That the Penance which  Pamela  suffers from Lady  Davers  might be shorten'd That she is too timorous after owning her Marriage to that Lady and ought to have a little more Spirit and get away sooner out at the Window or call her own Servants to protect and carry her to her Husband's Appointment  That Females are too apt to be struck with Images of Beauty and that the Passage where the Gentleman is said to span the Waist of  Pamela  with his Hand is enough to ruin a Nation of Women by Tightlacing  That the Word  naughty  had better be changed to some other as  Bad Faulty Wicked Vile Abominable Scandalous  Which in most Places would  give an Emphasis for which recourse must otherwise be had to the innocent Simplicity of the Writer an Idea not necessary to the Moral of the Story nor of Advantage to the Character of the Heroine  That the Words  p    Foolish Thing that I am  had better be  Foolish that I am  The same Gentleman observes by way of  Postscript  that Jokes are often more severe and do more Mischief than more solid Objections and would have one or two Passages alter'd to avoid giving Occasion for the Supposition of a double Entendre particularly in two Places which he mentions  viz p    and    He is pleased to take notice of several other Things of less Moment some of which are merely typographical and very kindly expresses on the Whole a high Opinion of the Performance and thinks it may do a great deal of Good For all which as well as for his Objections the Editor gives him very sincere Thanks  Others are of Opinion That the Scenes in many Places in the Beginning especially are too low and that the Passions of Lady  Davers  in particular are carried too high and above Nature    And others have intimated That  Pamela  ought for Example sake to have discharg'd Mrs  Jewkes  from her Service    These are the most material Objections that have come to hand all which are considered in the following Extracts from some of the most beautiful Letters that have been written in any Language  'The Gentleman's Advice not to alter  Pamela  at all was both friendly and solidly just I run in with full Sail to his Anchorage that the low Scenes are no more out of Nature than the  high Passions of proud Lady  Davers  Out of Nature do they say 'Tis my Astonishment how Men of Letters can read with such absent Attention They are so far from  Out  of  Nature  They are absolute  Nature herself  or if they must be confess'd her  Resemblance  they are  such  a Resemblance at least as our  true Face  gives our  Face  in the  Lookingglass    'I wonder indeed what it is that the Gentlemen who talk of  Low  Scenes wou'd desire should be understood by the EpithetNothing properly speaking is  low  that suits well with the Place it is rais'd toThe Passions of Nature are the same in the  Lord  and his  Coachman  All that makes them seem different consists in the  Degrees  in the  Means  and the  Air  whereto or wherewith they indulge 'em If in painting Distinctions like these which arise but from the Forms of Men's Manners drawn from  Birth Education  and  Custom  a Writer  falls short  of his Characters there his Scene is a low one indeed whatever high Fortune it flatter'd But to imagine that Persons of Rank are above a Concern for what is thought felt or acted by others of their Species between whom and themselves is  no Difference  except such as was owing to Accident is to reduce Human Nature to a Lowness  too low  for the  Truth  of her  Frailty    'In  Pamela  in particular we owe All to her  Lowness  It is to the docile Effects of this Lowness of  that amiable Girl  in her Birth her Condition her Hopes and her Vanities in every thing in short but her  Virtue  that her Readers are indebted for the moral  Reward  of that  Virtue  And if we are to look for the  Low  among the Rest of the Servants less lovely tho'  they are than a  Pamela  there is something however so glowingly painted in the Lines whereby the Author has mark'd their Distinctions Something so movingly forceful in the  Grief  at their  Parting  and  Joy  at the happy  Return  Something so finely at once and so strongly and feelingly  varied  even in the smallest and least promising little Family Incidents that I need only appeal from the  Heads  to the  Hearts  of the Objectors themselves whether these are  low  Scenes to be censur'd  'And as for the opposite Extreme they wou'd quarrel with the highpassion'd and untam'd Lady  Davers  I cou'd direct 'em to a Dozen or two of  Quality Originals  from whom with Exception perhaps of her  Wit  one wou'd swear the Author had taken her CopyWhat a Sum might these Objectors ensure to be paid by the  Husbands  and  Sons  of such termagant hermaphrodite Minds upon their making due Proof that they were no longer to be found in the Kingdom  'I know you are too just to imagine me capable of giving any other Opinion than my bestweigh'd and true one But because it is fit you should have  Reasons  in Support of a Judgment that can neither deserve nor expect an implicit Reception I will run over the Anonymous Letter I herewith return you and note with what Lightness even Men of  goodnatur'd  Intention fall into  Mistakes  by Neglect in too hasty Perusals which their Benevolence wou'd take Pleasure in blushing at when they discover their Weakness in a cooler Revisal  'The Writer of this Letter is for having the Style  rais'd  after  Pamela  's Advance in her Fortune But surely This was hasty Advice because  as the Letters are writ to her Parents it wou'd have look'd like forgetting and in some sort insulting the Lowliness of their inferior Condition to have assum'd a new Air in her Language in Place of retaining a steady Humility But here it must not be pass'd unobserv'd that in her Reports of Conversations that follow'd her Marriage she  does  aptly and beautifully heighten her Style and her Phrases still returning however to her decent Simplicity in her Addresses to her Father and Mother  'I am against giving a Gentleman who has ennobled himself by reforming his Vices and rewarding the Worth of the  Friendless  the unnecessary new Toy of a  Title  It is all strong in Nature as it stands in the Letters and I don't see how Greatness from Titles can add Likeness or Power to the Passions So complete a Resemblance of  Truth  stands in need of no borrow'd Pretensions  'The Only of this Writer's Objections which I think carries Weight is That which advises some little  Contraction  of the Prayers and Appeals to the Deity I say  little  Contraction for they are nobly and sincerely pathetic And I say it only in Fear lest if fansied too long by the fashionably  Averse  to the Subject Minds which most want the  purpos'd Impression  might hazard the  Loss  of its  Benefit  by passing over those pious Reflections which if shorter would catch their Attention  'Certainly the Gentleman's Objection against the Persecution that  Pamela  suffers from Lady  Davers  in respect to the Relation this Madwoman bears to the  Brother  is the rashest of All his Advices And when he thinks she ought rather  to have assum'd the Protection of her Servants he seems unaware of the probable  Consequence  where there was a Puppy of Quality in the Case who had even without Provocation drawn his Sword on the poor passive PAMELA Far from bearing a Thought of exciting an abler Resentment to the Danger of a Quarrel with so worthless a Coxcomb how charmingly natural apprehensive and generous is her Silence during the Recital she makes of her Sufferings with regard to this  masculine  Part of the Insult as also her Prevention of Mrs  Jewkes  's less delicate Bluntness when she was beginning to complain of the whelp Lord's Impertinence  'If I were not afraid of a  Pun  I shou'd tell the anonymous Letterwriter that he made a too  tightlaced  Objection where he quarrels with the spann'd Waist of  Pamela  What in the Name of Unshapeliness cou'd he find to complain of in a beautiful Girl of Sixteen who was born  out of Germany  and had not yet reach'd ungraspable  Roundness  These are wonderful Sinkings from Purpose where a Man is considering such mental and passionate Beauties as this Gentleman profess'd to be touch'd by  'But when he goes on to object against the Word  naughty  as apply'd in the Phrase  naughty Master  I grow mortified in Fear for our human Sufficiency compar'd with our Aptness to blunder For here 'tis plain this Director of Another's Discernment is quite blind Himself to an Elegance one wou'd have thought it  impossible  not to be struck by Faulty wicked abominable scandalous which are the angry Adjectives he prefers to that sweet one wou'd have carried Marks of her Rage not Affliction  whereas  naughty  contains in One single significant Petulance twenty thousand inexpressible Delicacies It insinuates at once all the beautiful Struggle between her Contempt of his Purpose and tender Regard for his Person her Gratitude to Himself and his Family her Recollection of his superior ConditionThere is in the elegant Choice of this halfkind halfpeevish  Word  a neverenough to be prais'd speaking Picture of the Conflict betwixt her Disdain and her Reverence See Sir the Reason I had for apprehending some Danger that the refin'd Generosity in many of the most charming of the Sentiments wou'd be  lost  upon the too coarse Conception of some for whose Use the Author intended them  'It is the same Case again in  foolish Thing that I am  which this nice unnice Gentleman wou'd advise you to change into  foolish that I am  He does not seem to have tasted the pretty Contempt of Herself the submissive  Diminutive  so distant from Vanity yet allay'd by the gentle Reluctance in Selfcondemnation and the other fine Touches of Nature which wou'd All have been lost in the grave sober Sound of his  Dutch Emendation    'As to his Paragraph in  Postscript  I shall say the less of it because the Gentleman's own good Sense seems to confess by the Place he has chosen to rank it in that it ought to be turn'd out of Doors as too  dirty  for the rest of his Letter In the Occasions he is pleas'd to discover for  Jokes  I either find not that he has any Signification at all or such vulgar coarsetasted Allusions to loose lowlife Idioms that  not  to understand what he means is both the cleanliest and prudentest Way of confuting him  'And now Sir you will easily gather how far I am from thinking it needful to change any thing in  Pamela  I would not scratch such a beautiful Face for the  Indies  'You can hardly imagine how it charms me to hear of a Second Edition already but the News of still new upon new ones will be found no Subject of Wonder As 'tis sure that no Family is without Sisters or Brothers or Daughters or Sons who can  read  or wants Fathers or Mothers or Friends who can  think  so equally certain it is that the Train to a Parcel of Powder does not run on with more natural Tendency till it sets the whole Heap in a Blaze than that  Pamela  inchanting from Family to Family will overspread all the Hearts of the Kingdom  'As to the Objection of those warm Friends to  Honesty  who are for having  Pamela  dismiss Mrs  Jewkes  there is not One among All these benevolent Complainers who wou'd not discern himself to have been  laudably  in the  wrong  were he only to be ask'd this plain Question Whether a Step both illjudg'd and undutiful had not been the Reverse of a PAMELA's Character Two or three times over Mr  B  had inform'd her that Mrs  Jewkes  and Himself having been equally involv'd in  One Guilt  she must forgive or condemn  Both together  After this it grew manifest  Duty  not to treat her with Marks of ResentmentAnd as here was a visible Necessity to appear not desirous of turning her away so in point of mere  Moral  Regard to the bad Woman Herself it was nobler to retain her with a Prospect of correcting in Time her loose Habit of thinking than by casting her off to the licentious Results of her Temper abandon  her to Temptations and Danger which a Virtue like PAMELA's cou'd not wish her expos'd to'  The Manner in which this admirable Gentleman gives his Opinion of the Piece and runs thro' the principal Characters is so masterly that the Readers of  Pamela  will be charm'd by it tho' they should suppose that his inimitable Benevolence has overvalu'd the Piece itself  'Inspir'd without doubt by some Skill more than human and comprehending in an humble and seemingly artless Narration a Force that can tear up the Heartstrings this Author has prepar'd an enamouring  Philtre  for the Mind which will excite such a  Passion  for Virtue as scarce to leave it in the Power of the  Will  to neglect her  '  Longinus  I remember distinguishing by what Marks we may know the  Sublime  says it is chiefly from an Effect that will follow the Reading it a delightfullyadhering Idea that clings fast to the Memory and from which it is difficult for a Man to disengage his AttentionIf  this  is a Proof of the  Sublime  there was never  Sublimity  so lastingly felt as in PAMELA  'Not the Charmer's own prattling Idea stuck so close to the Heart of her Master as the Incidents of her Story to the Thoughts of a Reader The Author transports and transforms with a Power more extensive than  Horace  requires in his POET  'Mr  B  and the Turns of his Passions and the Softness yet Strength of their amiable Object after having given us the most masterly Image of Nature that ever was painted  take Possession of and  dwell in  the Memory'  'And there too broods the kind and the credulous Parson WILLIAMS'S  Dove  without  serpentine  Mixture hatching  Pity  and  Affection  for an Honesty so sincere and so silly  'There too take their Places All the  lower  'Supports of this beautiful Fabrick  'I am sometimes transform'd into plain Goodman ANDREWS and sometimes the good Woman his Wife  'As for old Mr LONGMAN and JONATHAN the Butler they are sure of me both in their Turns  'Now andthen I am COLBRAND the  Swiss  but as  broad  as  I stride  in that Character I can never escape Mrs JEWKES who often keeps me awake in the Night  'Till the Ghost of Lady DAVERS drawing open the Curtains scares the  Scarer  of me and of PAMELA  'And then I take Shelter with poor penitent JOHN and the rest of the  Men  and the  Maids  of all whom I may say with compassionate  Marcia    '  The Youths  DIVIDE  their Reader  '  And this fine Writer adds  'I am glad I made War in my last upon the Notion of altering the Style for having read it twice over since then and to Audiences where the  Tears  were applausively eloquent I could hardly here and there find a Place where one Word  can  be chang'd for a better There are some indeed where 'twere  possible  to leave out a few without making a Breach in the Building But  in short the Author has put so bewitching a Mixture together of the  Rais'd  with the  Natural  and the  Soft  with the  Strong  and the  Eloquent  that never Sentiments were finer and fuller of Life never any were utter'd so sweetlyEven in what relates to the pious and frequent Addresses to God I now retract on these two last Revisals the Consent I half gave on a  former  to the anonymous Writer's Proposal who advis'd the Author to  shorten  those BeautiesWhoever considers his  Pamela  with a View to find Matter for Censure is in the Condition of a passionate Lover who breaks in upon his Mistress without Fear or Wit with Intent to accuse her and quarrelHe came to her with Pique in his Purpose but his  Heart  is too hard for his  Malice  and he goes away more enslav'd for complaining'  The following delightful Story so admirably related will give great Pleasure to the Reader and we take the Liberty of inserting it for that very Reason  'What a nevertobe satisfied  Length  has this Subject always the Power of attracting me into And yet before I have done I must by your means tell the Author a  Story  which a Judge not so skilful in Nature as he is might be in Danger perhaps of mistaking for a trifling and silly one I expect it shou'd give him the clearest Conviction in a Case he is subject to question  'We have a lively little Boy in the Family about seven Years oldbut alas for him poor Child quite unfriended and born to no Prospect He is the Son of an honest poor Soldier by a Wife grave unmeaning and innocent Yet the Boy see the Power of connubial  Simplicity    is so pretty so genteel and gayspirited that we have made him and design'd him our  own  ever since he could totter and waddle The wanton Rogue is half Air and every Motion he acts by has a Spring like  Pamela  's when she threw down the Cardtable All this Quickness however is temper'd by a goodnatur'd Modesty so that the wildest of his Flights are thought rather diverting than troublesome He is an hourly Foundation for Laughter from the Top of the House to the Parlours and to borrow an Attribute from the Reverend Mr  Peters  tho' without any Note of his Musick  plays a very good  FIDDLE in the Family I have told you the History of this  Tomtit  of a Prater because ever since my first reading of PAMELA he puts in for a Right to be  one  of her Hearers and having got half her Sayings by heart talks in no other Language but hers and what really surprises and has charm'd me into a  certain  Foretaste of her Influence he is at once become fond of his Book which before he cou'd never be brought to attend tothat  he may read  PAMELA he says  without stopping  The first Discovery we made of this Power over so unripe and unfix'd an Attention was one Evening when I was reading her Reflections at the  Pond  to some Company The little rampant Intruder being kept out by the Extent of the Circle had crept under my Chair and was sitting before me on the Carpet with his Head almost touching the Book and his Face bowing down toward the FireHe had sat for some time in this Posture with a Stillness that made us conclude him asleep when on a sudden we heard a Succession of heartheaving Sobs which while he strove to  conceal from our Notice his little Sides swell'd as if they wou'd burst with the throbbing Restraint of his Sorrow I turn'd his innocent Face to look toward me but his Eyes were quite lost in his  Tears  which running down from his Cheeks in free Currents had form'd two sincere little Fountains on that Part of the Carpet he hung over All the Ladies in Company were ready to devour him with Kisses and he has since become doubly a Favouriteand is perhaps the youngest of  Pamela  's  Converts    The same incomparable Writer has favour'd us with an Objection that is more material than any we have mention'd which cannot be better stated nor answer'd than in his own beautiful Words  viz  'An Objection is come into my Thoughts which I should be glad the Author would think proper to obviate in the Front of the Second Edition  'There are Mothers or Grandmothers in all Families of affluent Fortune who tho' they may have none of Lady  Davers  's  Insolence  will be apt to feel one of her  Fears  that the Example of a Gentleman so amiable as Mr  B  may be follow'd by the  Jackies their Sons  with too blind and unreflecting a Readiness Nor does the Answer of that Gentleman to his Sister's Reproach come quite up to the Point they will rest on For tho' indeed it is true all the World wou'd acquit the best Gentleman in it if he married  such  a Waitingmaid as  Pamela  yet there is an illdiscerning Partiality in Passion that will overthrow all the Force of that Argument because  every belov'd Maid will be  PAMELA in a Judgment obscur'd by her Influence  'And since the Ground of this Fear will  seem  solid I don't know how to be easy till it is shewn nor ought it to be left to the Author's Modesty that they who consider his Design in that Light will be found but shortsighted Observers  'Request it of him then to suffer it to be told them that not a limited but general Excitement to Virtue was the first and great End to his Story And that this Excitement must have been deficient and very imperfectly offer'd if he had not look'd quite  as low as he cou'd  for his Example because if there had been any Degree or Condition more remote from the Prospect than that which he had chosen to work on that Degree might have seem'd out of Reach of the Hope which it was his generous Purpose to encourage And so he was under an evident  Necessity  to find such a Jewel in a  Cottage  and expos'd too as she was to the severest Distresses of Fortune with Parents unable to support their own Lives but from the daily hard Product of  Labour    'Nor wou'd it have been sufficient to have plac'd her thus  low  and  distressful  if he had not also suppos'd her a  Servant  and that too in some elegant Family for if she had always remain'd a Fellowcottager with her Father it must have carried an Air of Romantick Improbability to account for her polite Education  'If she had  wanted  those Improvements which she found means to acquire in her  Service  it wou'd have been very unlikely that she shou'd have succeeded so well and had destroy'd  one  great  Use  of the Story to have allow'd such uncommon Felicity to the Effect of mere  personal Beauty    And it had not been  judicious  to have represented her as educated in a superior Condition of Life with the proper Accomplishments before she became reduc'd by Misfortunes and so not a Servant but rather an Orphan under hopeless Distresses because Opportunities which had made it no Wonder how she came to be so winningly qualified wou'd have lessen'd her Merit in being so And besides where had then been the purpos'd Excitement of Persons in PAMELA's Condition of Life by an Emulation of her Sweetness Humility Modesty Patience and Industry to attain some faint Hope of arriving in time within View of  her  Happiness And what a delightful Reformation shou'd we see in all Families where the Vanity of their  Maids  took no Turn toward Ambition to  please  but by such innocent Measures as PAMELA's  'As it is clear then the Author was under a Necessity to suppose her a  Servant  he is not to be accountable for mistaken Impressions which the Charms he has given her may happen to make on wrong Heads or weak Hearts tho' in Favour of Maids the Reverse of her Likeness  'What is it then they may say that the Lowness and Distance of  Pamela  's Condition from the Gentleman's who married her proposes to teach the  Gay World  and the  FortunateIt is this  By Comparison with that infinite Remoteness of her Condition from the Reward which her Virtue procur'd her one great  Proof  is deriv'd which is Part of the  Moral  of PAMELA that Advantages from  Birth  and Distinction of  Fortune  have no Power at all when consider'd against those from  Behaviour  and Temper of  Mind  because where the  Last  are  not added  all  the  First  will be boasted in vain Whereas she who possesses the Last finds  no Want  of the First in her Influence  'In  that  Light alone let the Ladies of  Rank  look at PAMELA Such an alarming Reflection as that will at the same time that it raises the Hope and Ambition of the  Humble  correct and mortify the Disdain of the  Proud  For it will compel them to observe and acknowledge that 'tis the Turn of their  Mind  not the Claims of their  Quality  by which and which only Womens Charms can be lasting And that while the  haughty Expectations  inseparable from an elevated Rank serve but to multiply its Complaints and Afflictions the Condescensions of  accomplish'd Humility  attracting Pity Affection and Reverence secure an hourly Increase of Felicity So that the  moral Meaning  of PAMELA's Goodfortune far from tempting young Gentlemen to marry  such  Maids as are found in their Families is by teaching Maids  to deserve to be Mistresses  to stir up Mistresses  to support their Distinction  '  We shall only add That it was intended to prefix two neat  Frontispieces  to this Edition and to present them to the Purchasers of the first and one was actually finished for that Purpose but there not being Time for the other from the Demand for the new Impression and the Engraving Part of that which was done tho' no Expence was spared having fallen very short of the Spirit of the Passages they were intended to represent the Proprietors were advised to lay them aside And were the rather induced to do so from the following Observation of a most ingenious Gentleman in a Letter to the Editor  'I am so jealous  says he  in Behalf of our  inward  Idea  of PAMELA's  Person  that I dread  any  figur'd Pretence to Resemblance For it will be pity to look at an  Air  and imagine it  Hers  that does not carry some such elegant Perfection of Amiableness as will be sure to find place in the  Fancy  '  VERSES sent to the Bookseller for the Unknown Author of the beautiful

and Mother  _I Have great Trouble and some Comfort to acquaint you with The Trouble is that my good Lady died of the Illness I mention'd to you and left us all much grieved for her Loss for she was a dear good Lady and kind to all us her Servants Much I fear'd that as I was taken by her Ladyship to wait upon her Person I should be quite destitute again and forc'd to return to you  and my poor Mother who have enough to do to maintain yourselves and as my Lady's Goodness had put me to write and cast Accompts and made me a little expert at my Needle and other Qualifications above my Degree it would have been no easy Matter to find a Place that your poor  Pamela  was fit for But God whose Graciousness to us we have so often experienc'd at a Pinch put it into my good Lady's Heart on her Deathbed just an Hour before she expir'd to recommend to my young Master all her Servants one by one and when it came to my Turn to be recommended for I was sobbing and crying at her Pillow she could only say My dear Son and so broke off a little and then recovering Remember my poor  Pamela  And these were some of her last Words O how my Eyes run Don't wonder to see the Paper so blotted  Well but God's Will must be done and so comes the Comfort that I shall not be oblig'd to return back to be a Clog upon my dear Parents For my Master said I will take care of you all my Lasses and for you  Pamela  and took me by the Hand yes he took my Hand before them all for my dear Mother's sake I will be a Friend to you and you shall take care of my Linen God bless him and pray with me my dear Father and Mother for a Blessing upon him For he has given Mourning and a Year's Wages to all my Lady's Servants and I having no Wages as yet my Lady having said she would do for me as I deserv'd order'd the Housekeeper to give me Mourning with the rest and gave me with his own Hand Four golden Guineas and some Silver which were in my old Lady's Pocket when she dy'd and said If I was a good Girl and faithful and diligent he would be a Friend to me for his Mother's sake And so I send  you these four Guineas for your Comfort for Providence will not let me want And so you may pay some old Debt with Part and keep the other Part to comfort you both If I get more I am sure it is my Duty and it shall be my Care to love and cherish you both for you have lov'd and cherish'd me when I could do nothing for myself And so you have for us all or what must have become of us I send it by  John  our Footman who goes your way but he does not know what he carries because I seal it up in one of the little Pill boxes which my Lady had wrapt close in Paper that it mayn't chink and be sure don't open it before him  I know dear Father and Mother I must give you both Grief and Pleasure and so I will only say Pray for your  Pamela  who will ever be  Your most dutiful Daughter  I have been scared out of my Senses for just now as I was folding this Letter in my late Lady's Dressingroom in comes my young Master Good Sirs how was I frightened I went to hide the Letter in my Bosom and he seeing me tremble said smiling Who have you been writing to  Pamela  I said in my Confusion Pray your Honour forgive me Only to my Father and Mother He said Well then Let me see how you are come on in your Writing O how asham'd I was He in my Fright took it without saying more and read it quite thro' and then gave it me again and I said Pray your Honour forgive me Yet I know not for what For he was always dutiful to  his  Parents and why should he be angry that I was so to  mine  And indeed he was not angry for he took me by the  Hand and said You are a good Girl  Pamela  to be kind to your aged Father and Mother I am not angry with you Be faithful and diligent and do as you should do and I like you the better for this And then he said Why  Pamela  you write a very pretty Hand and  spell  tolerably too I see my good Mother's Care in your Learning has not been thrown away upon you She used to say you lov'd reading you may look into any of her Books to improve yourself so you take care of them To be sure I did nothing but curtesy and cry and was all in Confusion at his Goodness Indeed he is the best of Gentlemen I think But I am making another long Letter So will only say further that I shall ever be  Your dutiful Daughter  PAMELA ANDREWS  LETTER II In Answer to the preceding  Dear  PAMELA  YOUR Letter was indeed a great Trouble and some Comfort to me and your poor Mother We are troubled to be sure for your good Lady's Death who took such Care of you and gave you Learning and for Three or Four Years past has always been giving you Cloaths and Linen and every thing that a Gentlewoman need not be asham'd to appear in But our chief Trouble is and indeed a very great  one for fear you should be brought to any thing dishonest or wicked by being set so above yourself Every body talks how you have come on and what a genteel Girl you are and some say you are very pretty and indeed Six Months since when I saw you last I should have thought so too if you was not our Child But what avails all this if you are to be ruin'd and undone Indeed my dear Child we begin to be in great Fear for you for what signify all the Riches in the World with a bad Conscience and to be dishonest We are 'tis true very poor and find it hard enough to live tho' once as you know it was better with us But we would sooner live upon the Water and Clay of the Ditches I am forced to dig than to live better at the Price of our dear Child's Ruin  I hope the good 'Squire has no Design but when he has given you so much Money and speaks so kindly to you and praises your coming on and Oh that fatal Word that he would be kind to you if you would do as  you should do  almost kills us with Fears  I have spoken to good old Widow  Mumford  about it who you know has formerly lived in good Families and she puts us in some Comfort for she says it is not unusual when a Lady dies to give what she has about her Person to her Waitingmaid and to such as sit up with her in her Illness But then why should he smile so kindly upon you Why should he take such a poor Girl as you by the Hand as your Letter says he has done twice Why should he stoop to read your Letter to us and commend your Writing and Spelling And why should he give you Leave to read his Mother's Books Indeed indeed my dearest Child our Hearts ake for you and then you seem so full of  Joy  at his Goodness so  taken  with his kind Expressions which truly are  very great Favours if he means well that we  fear  Yes my dear Child we  fear  you should be  too  grateful and reward him with that Jewel your Virtue which no Riches nor Favour nor any thing in this Life can make up to you  I too have written a long Letter but will say one Thing more and that is That in the Midst of our Poverty and Misfortunes we have trusted in God's Goodness and been honest and doubt not to be happy hereafter if we continue to be good tho' our Lot is hard here but the Loss of our dear Child's Virtue would be a Grief that we could not bear and would bring our grey Hairs to the Grave at once  If then you love  us  if you value  God  's Blessing and  your own  future Happiness we both charge you to stand upon your Guard and if you find the least Attempt made upon your Virtue be sure you leave every thing behind you and come away to us for we had rather see you all cover'd with Rags and even follow you to the Churchyard than have it said a Child of ours preferr'd any worldly Conveniencies to her Virtue  We accept kindly of your dutiful Present but 'till we are out of our Pain cannot make use of it for fear we should partake of the Price of our poor Daughter's Shame So have laid it up in a Rag among the Thatch over the Window for a while lest we should be robb'd With our Blessings and our hearty Prayers for you we remain  Your careful but loving Father and Mother  JOHN  and  ELIZABETH ANDREWS  LETTER III  Dear Father  I Must needs say your Letter has fill'd me with much Trouble For it has made my Heart which was overflowing with Gratitude for my Master's Goodness suspicious and fearful and yet I hope I shall never find him to act unworthy of his Character for what could he get by ruining such a poor young Creature as me But that which gives me most Trouble is that you seem to mistrust the Honesty of your Child No my dear Father and Mother be assur'd that by God's Grace I never will do any thing that shall bring your grey Hairs with Sorrow to the Grave I will die a thousand Deaths rather than be dishonest any way Of that be assur'd and set your Hearts at Rest for altho' I have liv'd above myself for some Time past yet I can be content with Rags and Poverty and Bread and Water and will embrace them rather than forfeit my good Name let who will be the Tempter And of this rest satisfy'd and think better of  Your dutiful Daughter till Death  My Master continues to be very affable to me As yet I see no Cause to fear any thing Mrs  Jervis  the Housekeeper too is very civil to me and I have the Love of every body Sure they can't  all  have Designs against me because they are civil I hope I shall always behave so as to be respected by every one and that nobody would do me more Hurt than I am sure I would do them Our  John  so often goes your way that I will always get him to call that you may hear from me either by Writing for it brings my Hand in or by Word of Mouth  LETTER IV  Dear Mother  FOR the last Letter was to my Father in Answer to his Letter and so I will now write to you tho' I have nothing to say but what will make me look more like a vain Hussy than any thing else Yet I hope I shan't be so proud as to forget myself Yet there is a secret Pleasure one has to hear one's self prais'd You must know then that my Lady  Davers  who I need not tell you is my Master's Sister has been a Month at our House and has taken great Notice of me and given me good Advice to keep myself to myself she told me I was a very pretty Wench and that every body gave me a very good Character and lov'd me and bid me take care to keep the Fellows at a Distance and said  that  I might do and be more valu'd for it even by themselves  But what pleas'd me much was what I am going to tell you for at Table as Mrs  Jervis  says my Master and her Ladyship talking of me she told him she thought me the prettiest Wench she ever saw in her Life and that I was too pretty to live in a Batchelor's House since no Lady he might marry would care to continue me with her He said I was vastly improv'd and had a good Share of Prudence and Sense above my Years and it would be Pity that what was my Merit should be my Misfortune No says my good Lady  Pamela  shall come and live with me I think He said Withall his Heart he should be glad to have me so well provided for Well said she I'll consult my Lord about it She ask'd How old I was and Mrs  Jervis  said I was Fifteen last  February  O says she if the Wench for so she calls all us Maiden Servants takes care of herself she'll improve yet more and more as well in her Person as Mind  Now my dear Father and Mother tho' this may look too vain to be repeated by me yet are you not rejoic'd as well as I to see my Master so willing to part with me This shews that he has nothing bad in his Heart But  John  is just going away and so I have only to say that I am and will always be  Your honest as well as dutiful Daughter  Pray make use of the Money You may now do it safely  LETTER V  My dear Father and Mother  JOHN  being to go your way I am willing to write because he is so willing to carry any thing for me He says it does him good at his Heart to see you both and to hear you talk He says you are both so sensible and so honest that he always learns something from you to the Purpose It is a thousand Pities he says that such worthy Hearts should not have better Luck in the World and wonders that you my Father who are so well able to teach and write so good a Hand succeeded no better in the School you attempted to set up but was forced to go to such hard Labour But this is more Pride to me that I am come of such honest Parents than if I had been born a Lady  I hear nothing yet of going to Lady  Davers  And I am very easy at present here For Mrs  Jervis  uses me as if I were her own Daughter and is a very good Woman and makes my Master's Interest her own She is always giving me good Counsel and I love her next to you two I think best of any body She keeps so good Rule and Order she is mightily respected by us all and takes Delight to hear me read to her and  all she loves to hear read is good Books which we read whenever we are alone so that I think I am at home with you She heard one of our Men  Harry  who is no better than he should be speak freely to me I think he called me his pretty  Pamela  and took hold of me as if he would have kissed me for which you may be sure I was very angry and she took him to Task and was as angry at him as could be and told me she was very well pleased to see my Prudence and Modesty and that I kept all the Fellows at a Distance And indeed I am sure I am not proud and carry it civilly to every body but yet methinks I cannot bear to be look'd upon by these Menservants for they seem as if they would look one thro' and as I genereally breakfast dine and sup with Mrs  Jervis  so good she is to me I am very easy that I have so little to say to them Not but they are very civil to me in the main for Mrs  Jervis  's sake who they see loves me and they stand in Awe of her knowing her to be a Gentlewoman born tho' she has had Misfortunes  I am going on again with a long Letter for I love Writing and shall tire you But when I began I only intended to say that I am quite fearless of any Danger now And indeed can but wonder at myself tho' your Caution to me was your watchful Love that I should be so foolish as to be so uneasy as I have been For I am sure my Master would not demean himself so as to think upon such a poor Girl as I for my Harm For such a thing would ruin his Credit as well as mine you know Who to be sure may expect one of the best Ladies in the Land So no more at present but that I am  Your everdutiful Daughter  LETTER VI  Dear Father and Mother  MY Master has been very kind since my last for he has given me a Suit of my late Lady's Cloaths and half a Dozen of her Shifts and Six fine Handkerchiefs and Three of her Cambrick Aprons and Four Holland ones The Cloaths are fine Silk and too rich and too good for me to be sure I wish it was no Affront to him to make Money of them and send it to you it would do me more good  You will be full of Fears I warrant now of some Design upon me till I tell you that he was with Mrs  Jervis  when he gave them me and he gave her a Mort of good Things at the same Time and bid her wear them in Remembrance of her good Friend my Lady his Mother And when he gave me these fine Things he said These  Pamela  are for you have them made fit for you when your Mourning is laid by and wear them for your good Mistress's sake Mrs  Jervis  gives you a very good Word and I would have you continue to behave as prudently as you have done hitherto and every body will be your Friend  I was so surpris'd at his Goodness that I could not tell what to say I curtesy'd to him and to Mrs  Jervis  for her good Word and said I wish'd I might be deserving of his Favour And nothing should be wanting in me to the best of my Knowledge  O how amiable a Thing is doing GoodIt is all I envy great Folks for  I always thought my young Master a fine Gentleman as every body says he is But he gave these  good Things to us both with such a Graciousness as I thought he look'd like an Angel  Mrs  Jervis  says he ask'd her If I kept the Men at a Distance for he said I was very pretty and to be drawn in to have any of them might be my Ruin and make me poor and miserable betimes She never is wanting to give me a good Word and took Occasion to launch out in my Praise she says But I hope she said no more than I shall try to deserve tho' I mayn't at present I am sure I will always love her next to you and my dear Mother So I rest  Your everdutiful Daughter  LETTER VII  Dear Father  SINCE my last my Master gave me more fine Things He call'd me up to my late Lady's Closer and pulling out her Drawers he gave me Two Suits of fine  Flanders  lac'd Headcloaths Three Pair of fine Silk Shoes two hardly the worse and just fit for me and the other with rich Silver Buckles in them for my Lady had a very little Foot and several Ribbands and Topknots of all Colours Four Pair of fine white Cotton Stockens and Three Pair of fine Silk ones and two Pair of rich Stays I was quite astonished and unable to speak for a while but yet I was inwardly ashamed to take the Stockens for Mrs  Jervis  was not there If she had it would have been nothing I believe I receiv'd them very awkwardly for he smil'd at my Awkwardness and said Don't blush  Pamela  Dost think I don't know pretty Maids wear Shoes and Stockens  I was so confounded at these Words you might have beat me down with a Feather For you must think there was no Answer to be made to this So like a Fool I was ready to cry and went away curtesying and blushing I am sure up to the Ears for tho' there was no Harm in what he said yet I did not know how to take it But I went and told all to Mrs  Jervis  who said God put it into his Heart to be good to me and I must double my Diligence It looked to her she said as if he would fit me in Dress for a Waitingmaid's Place on Lady  Davers  's own Person  But still your kind fatherly Cautions came into my Head and made all these Gifts nothing near to me what they would have been But yet I hope there is no Reason for what Good could it do to him to harm such a simple Maiden as me Besides to be sure no Lady would look upon him if he should so disgrace himself So I will make myself easy and indeed I should never have been otherwise if you had not put it into my Head for my Good I know very well But maybe without these Uneasinesses to mingle with these Benefits I might be too much puff'd up So I will conclude All that happens is sor our Good and so God bless you my dear Father and Mother and I know you constantly pray for a Blessing upon me who am and shall always be  Your dutiful Daughter  LETTER VIII  Dear  PAMELA  I Cannot but renew my Cautions to you on your Master's Kindness to you and his free Expression to you about the Stockens Yet there may not be  and I hope there is not any thing in it But when I reflect that there  possibly  may and that if there should no less depends upon it than my Child's everlasting Happiness in this World and the next it is enough to make one fearful for you Arm yourself my dear Child for the worst and resolve to lose your Life sooner than your Virtue What tho' the Doubts I fill'd you with lessen the Pleasure you would have had in your Master's Kindness yet what signify the Delights that arise from a few paltry fine Cloaths in Comparison with a good Conscience  These are indeed very great Favours that he heaps upon you but so much the more to be suspected and when you say he look'd so amiably and like an Angel how afraid I am that they should make too great an Impression upon you For tho' you are blessed with Sense and Prudence above your Years yet I tremble to think what a sad Hazard a poor Maiden of little more than Fifteen Years of Age stands against the Temptations of this World and a designing young Gentleman if he should prove so who has so much  Power  to oblige and has a kind of  Authority  to command as your Master  I charge you my dear Child on both our Blessings poor as we are to be on your Guard there can be no Harm in that and since Mrs  Jervis  is so good a Gentlewoman and so kind to you I am the easier a great deal and so is your Mother and we hope you will hide nothing from her▪ and take her Counsel in every thing So with our Blessings and assured Prayers for you more than for ourselves we remain  Your loving Father and Mother  Besure don't let People's telling you you are pretty puff you up for you did not make yourself and  so can have no Praise due to you for it It is Virtue and Goodness only that make the true Beauty Remember that  Pamela    LETTER IX  Dear Father and Mother  I Am sorry to write you Word that the Hopes I had of going to wait on Lady  Davers  are quite over My Lady would have had me but my Master as I heard bythebye would not consent to it He said her Nephew might be taken with me and I might draw him in or be drawn in by him and he thought as his Mother loved me and committed me to his Care he ought to continue me with him and Mrs  Jervis  would be a Mother to me Mrs  Jervis  tells me the Lady shook her Head and said  Ah Brother  and that was all And as you have made me fearful by your Cautions my Heart at times misgives me But I say nothing yet of your Caution or my own Uneasiness to Mrs  Jervis  not that I mistrust her but for fear she should think me presumptuous and vain and conceited to have any Fears about the matter from the great Distance between so great a Man and so poor a Girl But yet Mrs  Jervis  seemed to build something upon Lady  Davers  ' shaking her Head and saying  Ah Brother  and no more God I hope will give me his Grace and so I will not if I can help it make myself too uneasy for I hope there is no Occasion But every little matter that happens I will acquaint you with that you shall continue to me your good Advice and pray for  Your sadhearted  PAMELA  LETTER X  Dear Mother  YOU and my good Father may wonder you have not had a Letter from me in so many Weeks but a sad sad Scene has been the Occasion of it For to be sure now it is too plain that all your Cautions were wellgrounded O my dear Mother I am miserable truly miserable But yet don't be frighted I am honestGod of his Goodness keep me so  O this Angel of a Master this fine Gentleman this gracious Benefactor to your poor  Pamela  who was to take care of me at the Prayer of his good dying Mother who was so careful of me lest I should be drawn in by Lord  Davers  's Nephew that he would not let me go to Lady  Davers  's This very Gentleman yes I  must  call him Gentleman tho' he has fallen from the Merit of that Title has degraded himself to offer Freedoms to his poor Servant He has now shewed himself in his true Colours and to  me  nothing appears so black and so frightful  I have not been idle but have writ from time to time how he by sly mean Degrees exposed his wicked Views But somebody stole my Letter and I know not what has become of it It was a very long one I fear that he who was mean enough to do bad things in one respect did not stick at  this  but be it as it will all the Use he can make of it will be that he may be ashamed of  his  Part I not of  mine  For he will see I was resolved to be virtuous and glory'd in the Honesty of my poor Parents  I will tell you all the next Opportunity for I am watch'd very narrowly and he says to Mrs  Jervis    This Girl is always scribbling I think she may be better employ'd And yet I work all Hours with my Needle upon his Linen and the fine Linen of the Family and am besides about flowering him a WaistcoatBut Oh my Heart's broke almost for what am I likely to have for my Reward but Shame and Disgrace or else ill Words and hard Treatment I'll tell you all soon and hope I shall find my long Letter  Your most afflicted Daughter  I must  he  and  him  him now for he has lost his Dignity with me  LETTER XI  Dear Mother  WELL I can't find my Letter and so I'll tell you all as briefly as I can All went well enough in the main for some time after my last Letter but one At last I saw some Reason to  suspect  for he would look upon me whenever he saw me in such a manner as shew'd not well and at last he came to me as I was in the Summerhouse in the little Garden at work with my Needle and Mrs  Jervis  was just gone from he and I would have gone out but he said No don't go  Pamela  I have something to say to you and you always fly me when I come near you as if you were afraid of me  I was much out of Countenance you may well think but said at last It does not become your  poor Servant to stay in your Presence Sir withou  your Business requir'd it and I hope I shall alway  know my Place  Well says he my Business does require it some times and I have a Mind you should stay to hear what I have to say to you  I stood all confounded and began to tremble and the more when he took me by the Hand for now no Soul was near us  My Sister  Davers  said he and seem'd I thought tobe as much at a Loss for Words as I would have had you live with  her  but she would not do for you what I am resolved to do if you continue faithful and obliging What say'st thou my Girl said he with some Eagerness hadst thou not rather stay with me than go to my Sister  Davers  He look'd so as fill'd me with Affrightment I don't know how wildly I thought  I said when I could speak Your Honour will forgive me but as you have no Lady for me to wait upon and my good Lady has been now dead this Twelvemonth I had rather if it would not displease you wait upon Lady  Davers because    I was proceeding and he said a little hastily  Because  you are a little Fool and know not what's good for yourself I tell you I will make a Gentlewoman of you if you be obliging and don't stand in your own Light and so saying he put his Arm about me and kiss'd me  Now you will say all his Wickedness appear'd plainly I struggled and trembled and was so benumb'd with Terror that I sunk down not in a Fit and yet not myself and I found myself in his Arms quite void of Strength and he kissed me two or three times with frightful EagernessAt last I burst from him and was getting out of the Summerhouse but he held me back and shut the Door  I would have given my Life for a Farthing And he said I'll do you no Harm  Pamela  don't be afraid of me I said I won't stay You won't Hussy said he Do you know whom you speak to I lost all Fear and all Respect and said Yes I do Sir too well Well may I forget that I am your Servant when you forget what belongs to a Master  I sobb'd and cry'd most sadly What a foolish Hussy you are said he have I done you any Harm Yes Sir said I the greatest Harm in the World You have taught me to forget myself and what belongs to me and have lessen'd the Distance that Fortune has made between us by demeaning yourself to be so free to a poor Servant Yet Sir I will be bold to say I am honest tho' poor And if you was a Prince I would not be otherwise  He was angry and said Who would have you otherwise you foolish Slut Cease your Blubbering I own I have demean'd myself but it was only to try you If you can keep this Matter secret you'll give me the better Opinion of your Prudence and here's something said he putting some Gold in my Hand to make you Amends for the Fright I put you in Go take a Walk in the Garden and don't go in till your Blubbering is over And I charge you say nothing of what has past and all shall be well and I'll forgive you  I won't take the Money indeed Sir said I poor as I am I won't take it For to say Truth I thought it look'd like taking Earnest and so I put it upon the Bench and as he seemed vex'd and confus'd at what he had done I took the Opportunity to open the Door and went out of the Summerhouse  He called to me and said Be secret I charge you  Pamela  and don't go in yet as I told you  O how poor and mean must those Actions be and how little must they make the best of Gentlemen  look when they offer such things as are unworthy of themselves and put it into the Power of their Inferiors to be greater than they  I took a Turn or two in the Garden but in Sight of the House for fear of the worst and breathed upon my Hand to dry my Eyes because I would not be too disobedient My next shall tell you more  Pray for me my dear Father and Mother and don't be angry I have not yet run away from this House so late my Comfort and Delight but now my Terror and Anguish I am forc'd to break off hastily  Your dutiful and honest Daughter  LETTER XII  Dear Mother  WELL I will now proceed with my sad Story And so after I had dry'd my Eyes I went in and began to ruminate with myself what I had best to do Sometimes I thought I would leave the House and go to the next Town and wait an Opportunity to get to you but then I was at a Loss to resolve whether to take away the Things he had given me or no and how to take them away Sometimes I thought to leave them behind me and only go with the Cloaths on my Back but then I had two Miles and a half and a Byway to the Town and being pretty well dress'd I might come to some Harm almost as bad as what I would run away from and then maybe thought I it will be reported I have stolen something and so was forc'd to run away and to carry a bad Name back with me to my dear Parents would be a sad thing indeed  O how I wish'd for my grey Russet again and my poor honest Dress with which you fitted me out and hard enough too you had to do it for going to this Place when I was not twelve Years old in my good Lady's Days Sometimes I thought of telling Mrs  Jervis  and taking her Advice and only feared his Command to be secret for thought I he may be ashamed of his Actions and never attempt the like again And as poor Mrs  Jervis  depended upon him thro' Misfortunes that had attended her I thought it would be a sad thing to bring his Displeasure upon her for my sake  In this Quandary now considering now crying and not knowing what to do I pass'd the Time in my Chamber till Evening when desiring to be excused going to Supper Mrs  Jervis  came up to me and said Why must I sup without you  Pamela  Come I see you are troubled at something tell me what is the Matter  I begg'd I might be permitted to lie with her on Nights for I was afraid of Spirits and they would not hurt such a good Person as she That was a silly Excuse she said for why was you not afraid of Spirits beforeIndeed I did not think of that But you shall be my Bedfellow with all my Heart added she let your Reason be what it will only come down to Supper I begg'd to be excus'd for said I I have been crying so that it will be taken Notice of by my Fellowservants and I will hide nothing from you Mrs  Jervis  when we are abed  She was so good to indulge me and went down to Supper but made more Haste to come up tobed and told the Servants that I should lie with her because she could not rest well and she would  get me to read her to sleep for she knew I lov'd reading as she said  When we were alone I told her all that had passed for I thought though he had bid me not yet if he should come to know I had told it would be no worse for to keep a Secret of such a Nature would be as I apprehended to deprive myself of the good Advice which I never wanted more and might encourage him to think I did not resent it as I ought and would keep worse Secrets and so make him do worse by me Was I right my dear Mother  Mrs  Jervis  could not help mingling Tears with my Tears for I cry'd all the Time I told her the Story and begg'd her to advise me what to do and I shew'd her my dear Father's two Letters and she praised the Honesty and Inditing of them and said pleasing Things to me of you both But she begg'd I would not think of leaving my Service for says she in all Likelihood you behav'd so virtuously that he will be asham'd of what he has done and never offer the like to you again Though my dear  Pamela  said she I fear more for your Prettiness than for any thing else because the best Man in the Land might love you so she was pleased to say She said she wish'd it was in her Power to live independent that then she would take a little private House and I should live with her like her Daughter  And so as you order'd me to take her Advice I resolved to tarry to see how Things went without he was to turn me away altho' in your first Letter you order'd me to come away the Moment I had any Reason to be apprehensive So dear Father and Mother it is not Disobedience I hope that I stay for I could not expect a Blessing or the good Fruits of your Prayers for me if I was disobedient  All the next Day I was very sad and began to write my long Letter He saw me writing and said as I mention'd to Mrs  Jervis  That Girl is always scribbling methinks she might find something else to do or to that purpose And when I had finish'd my Letter I put it under the Toilet in my late Lady's Dressingroom whither nobody comes but myself and Mrs  Jervis  besides my Master but when I came up again to seal it up to my great Concern it was gone and Mrs  Jervis  knew nothing of it and nobody knew of my Master's having been near the Place in the Time so I have been sadly troubled about it But Mrs  Jervis  as well as I thinks he has it some how or other and he appears cross and angry and seems to shun me as much as he said I did him It had better be so than worse  But he has order'd Mrs  Jervis  to bid me not pass so much Time in writing which is a poor Matter for such a Gentleman as he to take Notice of as I am not idle otherways if he did not resent what he thought I wrote upon And this has no very good Look  But I am a good deal easier since I lie with Mrs  Jervis  tho' after all the Fears I live in on one Side and his Frowning and Displeasure at what I do on the other make me more miserable than enough  O that I had never left my Rags and my Poverty to be thus expos'd to Temptations on one hand or Disgusts on the other How happy was I a while ago How contrary nowPity and pray for  Your afflicted  PAMELA  LETTER XIII  My Dearest Child  OUR Hearts bleed for your Distress and the Temptations you are tried with You have our hourly Prayers and we would have you flee this evil Great House and Man if you find he renews his Attempts You ought to have done it at first had you nor had Mrs  Jervis  to advise with We can find no Fault in your Conduct hitherto But it makes our Hearts ake for fear of the worst O my Child Temptations are sore Things but yet without them we know not ourselves nor what we are able to do  Your Temptations are very great for you have Riches Youth and a fine Gentleman as the World reckons him to withstand but how great will be your Honour to withstand them And when we consider your past Conduct and your virtuous Education and that you have been bred to be more asham'd of Dishonesty than Poverty we trust in God that He will enable you to overcome Yet as we can't see but your Life must be a Burden to you through the great Apprehensions always upon you and that it may be presumptious to trust too much to your own Strength and that you are but very young and the Devil may put into his Head to use some Stratagem of which great Men are full to decoy you I think you had better come home to share our Poverty with Safety than to live with so much Discontent in a Plenty that itself may be dangerous God direct you for the best While you have Mrs  Jervis  for an Adviser and Bedsellow and O my dear Child that was prudently done of you we are  easier than we should be and so committing you to the Divine Protection remain  Your truly loving but careful Father and Mother  LETTER XIV  Dear Father and Mother  MRS  Jervis  and I have liv'd very comfortably together for this Fortnight past for my Master was all that time at his  Lincolnshire  Estate and at his Sister's the Lady  Davers  But he came home Yesterday He had some Talk with Mrs  Jervis  soon after he came home and mostly about me He said to her it seems Well Mrs  Jervis  I know  Pamela  has your good Word but do you think her of any Use in the Family She told me she was surpris'd at the Question but said That I was one of the most virtuous and industrious young Creatures that ever she knew Why that Word  virtuous  said he I pray you Was there any Reason to suppose her otherwise Or has any body taken it into their Heads to  try  her I wonder Sir says she you ask such a Question Who dare offer any thing to her in such an orderly and wellgovern'd House as yours and under a Master of so good a Character for Virtue and Honour Your Servant Mrs  Jervis  says he for your good Opinion but pray if any body  did  do you think  Pamela  would let  you  know it Why Sir said she she is a poor innocent young Creature and I believe has so much Confidence in me that she would take my Advice as soon as she would her Mother's  Innocent  again and  virtuous  I warrant  Well Mrs  Jervis  you abound with your Epithets but I take her to be an artful young Baggage and had I a young handsome Butler or Steward she'd soon make her Market of one of them if she thought it worth while to snap at him for a Husband Alackaday Sir said she 'tis early Days with  Pamela  and she does not yet think of a Husband I dare say And your Steward and Butler are both Men in Years and think nothing of the Matter No said he if they were younger they'd have more Wit than to think of such a Girl I'll tell you my Mind of her Mrs  Jervis  I don't think this same Favourite of yours so very artless a Girl as you imagine I am not to dispute with your Honour said Mrs  Jervis  but I dare say if the Men will let her alone she'll never trouble herself about them Why Mrs  Jervis  said he are there any Men that will  not  let her alone that you know of No indeed Sir said she she keeps herself so much to herself and yet behaves so prudently that they all esteem her and shew her as great Respect as if she was a Gentlewoman born  Ay says he that's her Art that I was speaking of But let me tell you the Girl has Vanity and Conceit and Pride too or I am mistaken and perhaps I could give you an Instance of it Sir said she you can see further than such a poor silly Woman as I but I never saw any thing but Innocence in herAnd  Virtue  too I'll warrant ye said he But suppose I could give you an Instance where she has talk'd a little too freely of the Kindnesses that have been shew'd her from a  certain Quarter  and has had the Vanity to impute a few kind Words utter'd in mere Compassion to her Youth and Circumstances into a Design upon her and even dar'd to make free with Names that she ought never to mention but with Reverence and Gratitude what  would you say to thatSay Sir said she I cannot tell what to say But I hope  Pamela  incapable of such Ingratitude  Well no more of this silly Girl says he you may only advise her as you are her Friend not to give herself too much Licence upon the Favours she meets with and if she stays here that she will not write the Affairs of my Family purely for an Exercise to her Pen and her Invention I tell you she is a subtle artful Gypsey and Time will shew it you  Was ever the like heard my dear Father and Mother It is plain he did not expect to meet with such a Repulse and mistrusts that I have told Mrs  Jervis  and has my long Letter too that I intended for you and so is vex'd to the Heart But I can't help it I had better be thought artful and subtle than be so in  his  Sense and as light as he makes of the Words  Virtue  and  Innocence  in me he would have made a less angry Construction had I less deserved that he should do so for then maybe my  Crime  would have been my  Virtue  with him naughty Gentleman as he is is  I will soon write again but must now end with saying That I am and shall always be  Your honest Daughter  LETTER XV  Dear Mother  I Broke off abruptly my last Letter for I fear'd he was coming and so it happen'd I put the Letter into my Bosom and took up my Work which lay by me but I had so little of the  Artful  as he  called it that I look'd as confused as if I had been doing some great Harm  Sit still  Pamela  said he and mind your Work for all meYou don't tell me I am welcome home after my Journey to  Lincolnshire  It would be hard Sir said I if you was not always welcome to your Honour's own House  I would have gone but he said Don't run away I tell you I have a Word or two to say to you Good Sirs how my Heart went pitapat When I was a  little kind  to you said he in the Summerhouse and you carry'd yourself so  foolishly  upon it as if I had intended to do you great Harm did I not tell you you should take no Notice of what pass'd to any Creature And yet you have made a common Talk of the Matter not considering either my Reputation or your ownI made a common Talk of it Sir said I I have nobody to talk to hardly  He interrupted me and said  Hardly  you little Equivocator what do you mean by  hardly  Let me ask you Have you not told Mrs  Jervis  for one Pray your Honour said I all in Agitation let me go down for 'tis not for  me  to hold an Argument with your Honour Equivocator again said he and took my Hand what do you talk of an  Argument  Is it holding an Argument with me to answer a plain Question Answer me what I ask'd O good Sir said I let me beg you will not urge me further for fear I forget myself again and be saucy  Answer me then I bid you says he Have you not told Mrs  Jervis  It will be saucy in you if you don't answer me directly to what I ask Sir said I and fain would have pulled my Hand away perhaps I should be for answering you by another Question and that would not become me What is it you would say replies be speak out  Then Sir said I why should your Honour be so angry I should tell Mrs  Jervis  or any body else what passed if you intended no Harm  Well said pretty  Innocent  and  Artless  as Mrs  Jervis  calls you said he and is it thus you taunt and retort upon me insolent as you are But still I will be answered directly to my Question Why then Sir said I I will not tell a Lie for the World I  did  tell Mrs  Jervis  for my Heart was almost broken but I open'd not my Mouth to any other Very well Boldface said he and Equivocator again You did not open your  Mouth  to any other but did you not  write  to some other Why now and please your Honour said I for I was quite courageous just then you could not have asked me this Question if you had not taken from me my Letter to my Father and Mother in which I own I had broken my Mind freely to them and asked their Advice and poured forth my Griefs  And so I am to be exposed am I said he  in  my House and  out  of my House to the whole World by such a Saucebox as you No good Sir said I and I hope your Honour won't be angry with me it is not  I  that expose you if I say nothing but the Truth So taunting again Assurance as you are said he I will not be thus talk'd to  Pray Sir said I whom can a poor Girl take Advice of if it must not be of her Father and Mother and such a good Woman as Mrs  Jervis  who for her Sexsake should give it me when asked Insolence said he and stamp'd with his Foot Am I to be question'd thus by such an one as you I fell down on my Knees and said For Heaven's sake your Honour pity a poor Creature that knows nothing of her Duty but how to cherish her Virtue and good Name I have nothing else to trust to and tho' poor and friendless here yet I have always  been taught to value Honesty above my Life Here's ado with your Honesty said he foolish Girl Is it not one Part of Honesty to be dutiful and grateful to your Master do you think Indeed Sir said I it is impossible I should be ingrateful to your Honour or disobedient or deserve the Names of Boldface and Insolent which you call me but when your Commands are contrary to that first Duty which shall ever be the Principle of my Life  He seem'd to be moved and rose up and walk'd into the great Chamber two or three Turns leaving me on my Knees and I threw my Apron over my Face and laid my Head on a Chair and cry'd as if my Heart would break having no Power to stir  At last he came in again but alas with Mischief in his Heart and raising me up he said Rise  Pamela  rise you are your own Enemy Your perverse Folly will be your Ruin I tell you this that I am very much displeased with the Freedoms you have taken with my Name to my Housekeeper as also to your Father and Mother and you may as well have  real  Cause to take these Freedoms with me as to make my Name suffer for  imaginary  ones And saying so he offer'd to take me on his Knee with some Force O how I was terrify'd I said like as I had read in a Book a Night or two before Angels and Saints and all the Host of Heaven defend me And may I never survive one Moment that fatal one in which I shall forfeit my Innocence Pretty Fool said he how will you forfeit your Innocence if you are oblig'd to yield to a Force you cannot withstand Be easy said he for let the worst happen that can  you'll  have the Merit and  I  the Blame and it will be a good Subject for Letters to your Father and Mother and a Tale into the Bargain for Mrs  Jervis    He by Force kissed my Neck and Lips and said Who ever blamed  Lucretia  but the  Ravisher  only And I am content to take all the Blame upon me as I have already borne too great a Share for what I have deserv'd May I said I  Lucretia  like justify myself with my Death if I am used barbarously O my good Girl said he tauntingly you are well read I see and we shall make out between us before we have done a pretty Story in Romance I warrant ye  He then put his Hand in my Bosom and the Indignation gave me double Strength and I got loose from him by a sudden Spring and ran out of the Room and the next Chamber being open I made shift to get into it and threwto the Door and the Key being on the Inside it locked but he follow'd me so close he got hold of my Gown and tore a Piece off which hung without the Door  I just remember I got into the Room for I knew nothing further of the Matter till afterwards for I fell into a Fit with my Fright and Terror and there I lay till he as I suppose looking through the Keyhole spy'd me lying all along upon the Floor stretch'd out at my Length and then he call'd Mrs  Jervis  to me who by his Assistance bursting open the Door he went away seeing me coming to myself and bid her say nothing of the Matter if she was wise  Poor Mrs  Jervis  thought it was worse and cry'd over me like as if she was my Mother and I was two Hours before I came to myself and just as I got a little up on my Feet he coming in I went away again with the Terror and so he withdrew But he staid in the next Room to let nobody come near us that his foul Proceedings might not be known  Mrs  Jervis  gave me her Smellingbottle and had cut my Laces and far me in a great Chair and he call'd her to him How is the Girl said he I never saw such a Fool in my Life I did nothing at all to her Mrs  Jervis  could not speak for crying So he said She has told you it seems that I was kind to her in the Summerhouse tho' I'll assure you I was quite innocent then as well as now and I desire you to keep this Matter to yourself and let  me  not be nam'd in it  O Sir said she for your Honour's sake and for Christ's sake But he would not hear her and said For  your own  sake I tell you Mrs  Jervis  say not a Word more I have done her no Harm And I won't have her stay in my House prating perverse Fool as she is But since she is so apt to fall into Fits or at least pretend to do so prepare her to see me Tomorrow after Dinner in my Mother's Closet and do you be with her and you shall hear what passes between us  And so he went out in a Pet and order'd his Chariot and Four to be got ready and went a Visiting somewhere  Mrs  Jervis  then came to me and I told her all that had happen'd and said I was resolv'd not to stay in the House And she saying He seem'd to threaten as much I said I am glad of that then I shall be easy So she told me all be had said to her as I have mention'd above  Mrs  Jervis  is very loth I should go and yet poor Woman she begins to be afraid for herself but would not have me ruin'd for the World She says To be sure he means no Good but maybe now he sees me so resolute he will give over all Attempts And that I shall better know what to do after Tomorrow when I am to appear before a very bad Judge I doubt  O how I dread this Tomorrow's Appearance But be assured my dear Parents of the Honesty of your poor Child As I am sure I am of your Prayers for  Your dutiful Daughter  O this frightful Tomorrow how I dread it  LETTER XVI  My dear Parents  I Know you longed to hear from me soon I send as soon as I could  Well you may believe how uneasily I passed the Time till his appointed Hour came Every Minute as it grew nearer my Terrors increased and sometimes I had great Courage and sometimes none at all and I thought I should faint when it came to the Time my Master had dined I could neither eat nor drink for my part and do what I could my Eyes were swell'd with crying  At last he went up to the Closet which was my good Lady's Dressingroom a Room I once lov'd but then as much hated  Don't your Heart ake for me I am sure mine flutter'd about like a newcaught Bird in a Cage O  Pamela  said I to myself why art thou so foolish and fearful Thou hast done no Harm What if thou fearest an unjust Judge when thou art innocent wouldst thou do before a just one if thou wert guilty Have Courage  Pamela  thou knowest the worst And how easy a Choice Poverty and Honesty is rather than Plenty and Wickedness  So I chear'd myself but yet my poor Heart sunk and my Spirits were quite broken Every thing that stirred I thought was to call me to my Account I dreaded it and yet I wished it to come  Well at last he rung the Bell O thought I that it was my Passingbell Mrs  Jervis  went up with a full Heart enough poor good Woman He said Where's  Pamela  Let her come up and do you come with her She came to me I was ready to come with my Feet but my Heart was with my dear Father and Mother wishing to share your Poverty and Happiness But I went  O how can wicked Men seem so steady and untouch'd with such black Hearts while poor Innocents look like Malefactors before them  He look'd so stern that my Heart failed me and I wish'd myself anywhere but there tho' I had before been summoning up all my Courage Good Heaven said I to myself give me Courage to stand before this naughty Master O soften him or harden me  Come in Fool said he angrily as soon as he saw me and snatch'd my Hand with a Pull you may well be ashamed to see me after your Noise and Nonsense and exposing me as you have done I asham'd to see  you  thought I Very pretty indeed But I said nothing  Mrs  Jervis  said he here you are both together Do you sit down but let her stand if she will Ay thought I if I  can  for my Knees beat one against another Did you not think when you saw the Girl in the Way you found her in that I had given her the greatest Occasion that could possibly be given any Woman And that I had actually ruined her as she calls it Tell me  could  you think any thing less Indeed say'd she I fear'd so at first Has she told you what I did to her and  all  I did to her to  occasion all this Folly by which my Reputation might have suffer'd in your Opinion and in that of all the FamilyInform me what has she told you  She was a little too much frighted as she owned afterwards at his Sternness and said Indeed she told me you only pulled her on your Knee and kissed her  Then I plucked up my Spirit a little  Only  Mrs  Jervis  said I and was not that enough to shew me what I had to fear When a Master of his Honour's Degree demeans himself to be so free as  that  to such a poor Servant as me what is the next to be expected But your Honour went further so you did and threaten'd me what you would do and talk'd of  Lucretia  and her hard FateYour Honour knows you went too far for a Master to a Servant or even to his Equal and I cannot bear it So I fell a crying most sadly  Mrs  Jervis  began to excuse me and to beg he would pity a poor Maiden that had such a Value for her Reputation He said I speak it to her Face I think her very pretty and I thought her humble and one that would not grow upon my Favours or the Notice I took of her but I abhor the Thought of forcing her to any thing I know myself better said he and what belongs to me And to be sure I have enough demean'd myself to take Notice of such a one as she but I was bewitch'd by her I think to be freer than became me tho' I had no Intention to carry the Jest farther  What poor Stuff was all this my dear Mother from a Man of his Sense But see how a bad Cause and bad Actions confound the greatest Wits It gave me a little more Courage then for Innocence I find in a weak mind has many Advantages over Guilt with all its Riches and Wisdom  So I said Your Honour may call this Jest or Sport or what you please but indeed Sir it is not a Jest that becomes the Distance between a Master and a Servant Do you hear Mrs  Jervis  said he Do you hear the Pertness of the Creature I had a good deal of this Sort before in the Summerhouse and Yesterday too which made me rougher with her than perhaps I had otherwise been  Says Mrs  Jervis Pamela  don't be pert to his Honour You should know your Distance you see his Honour was only in Jest O dear Mrs  Jervis  said I don't  you  blame me too It is very difficult to keep one's Distance to the greatest of Men when they won't keep it themselves to their meanest Servants  See again said he could you believe this of the young Baggage if you had not heard it Good your Honour said the wellmeaning Gentlewoman pity and forgive the poor Girl she is but a Girl and her Virtue is very dear to her and I will pawn my Life for her she will never be pert to your Honour if you'll be so good as to molest her no more nor frighten her again Said she You see how by her Fit she was in Terror she could not help it and tho' your Honour intended her no Harm yet the Apprehension was almost Death to her And I had much ado to bring her to herself again O the little Hypocrite said he she has all the Arts of her Sex they are  born  with her and I told you awhile ago you did not know her But said he this was not the Reason principally of my calling you before me both together I find I am likely to suffer in my Reputation by the Perverseness and Folly of this Girl She has told you all and perhaps more than all nay I make no Doubt of it and she has written Letters for I find she is a mighty Letterwriter to her Father and Mother and others as far as I  know in which she makes herself an Angel of Light and me her kind Master and Benefactor a Devil incarnateO how People will sometimes thought I call themselves by their right Names And all this I won't bear and so I am resolv'd she shall return to the Distresses and Poverty she was taken from and let her take care how she uses my Name with Freedom when she is gone from me  I was brighten'd up at once with these welcome Words And I threw myself upon my Knees at his Feet with a most sincere glad Heart and I said May your Honour be for ever blessed for your Resolution Now I shall be happy And permit me on my bended Knees to thank you for all the Benefits and Favours you have heap'd upon me for the Opportunities I have had of Improvement and Learning thro' my good Lady's Means and yours I will now forget all your Honour has offer'd to me And I promise you that I will never take your Name in my Lips but with Reverence and Gratitude And so God Almighty bless your Honour for ever and ever  Amen  Then rising from my Knees I went away with anotherguise sort of Heart than I came into his Presence with And so I fell to writing this Letter And thus all is happily over  And now my dearest Father and Mother expect to see soon your poor Daughter with an humble and dutiful Mind return'd to you And don't fear but I know how to be happy with you as ever For I will lie in the Loft as I used to do and pray let the little Bed be got ready and I have a little Money which will buy me a Suit of Cloaths fitter for my Condition than what I have and I will get Mrs  Mumford  to help me to some Needlework and fear not that I shall be a Burden to you if my Health continues and I know I shall be blessed  if not for my own sake for both your sakes who have in all your Trials and Misfortunes preserved so much Integrity as makes every body speak well of you both But I hope he will let good Mrs  Jervis  give me a Character for fear it should be thought I was turn'd away for Dishonesty  And so my dear Parents may you be blest for me and I for you And I will always pray for my Master and Mrs  Jervis  So good Night for it is late and I shall be soon called tobed  I hope Mrs  Jervis  is not angry with me because she has not called me to Supper with her tho' I could eat nothing if she had But I make no Doubt I shall sleep purely Tonight and dream that I am with you in my dear dear happy Loft once more  So good Night again my dear Father and Mother says  Your honest poor Daughter  Mayhap I mayn't come this Week because I must get up the Linen and leave in Order every thing belonging to my Place So send me a Line if you can to let me know if I shall be welcome by  John  who'll call for it as he returns But say nothing of my coming away to him as yet For it will be said I blab every thing  LETTER XVII  My dearest Daughter  WELCOME welcome ten times welcome shall you be to us for you come to us innocent and happy and honest and you are the Staff  of our old Age and our Comfort too And tho' we cannot do for you as we would yet we doubt not we shall live comfortably together and what with my diligent Labour and your poor Mother's Spinning and your Needlework I make no Doubt we shall live better and better Only your poor Mother's Eyes begin to fail her tho' I bless God I am as strong and able and willing to labour as ever and O my dear Child your Virtue has made me I think stronger and better than I was before What blessed Things are Trials and Temptations to us when they be overcome  But I am thinking about those same four Guineas I think you should give them back again to your Master and yet I have broke them Alas I have only three left but I will borrow it if I can Part upon my Wages and Part of Mrs  Mumford  and send it to you that you may return it against  John  comes next if he comes again before you  I want to know how you come I fancy honest  John  will be glad to bear you Company Part of the Way if your Master is not so cross as to forbid him And if I know time enough your Mother will go one five Miles and I will go ten on the Way or till I meet you as far as one Holiday will go for that I can get Leave for And we shall receive you with more Pleasure than we had at your Birth when all the worst was over or than we ever had in our Lives  And so God bless you till the happy Time comes say both your Mother and I which is all at present from  Your truly loving Parents  LETTER XVIII  Dear Father and Mother  I Thank you a thousand times for your Goodness to me express'd in your last Letter I now long to get my Business done and come to my newold Lot again as I may call it I have been quite another thing since my Master has turned me off and as I shall come to you an honest Daughter what Pleasure it is to what I should have had if I could not have seen you but as a guilty one Well my writing Time will soon be over and so I will make use of it now and tell you all that has happened since my last Letter  I wonder'd Mrs  Jervis  did not call me to sup with her and fear'd she was angry and when I had finish'd my Letter I long'd for her coming to Bed At last she came up but seem'd shy and reserv'd and I said O my dear Mrs  Jervis  I am glad to see you You are not angry with me I hope She said she was sorry Things had gone so far and that she had a great deal of Talk with my Master after I was gone that he seem'd mov'd at what I said and at my falling on my Knees to him and my Prayer for him at my going away He said I was a strange Girl he knew not what to make of me And is she gone said he I intended to say something else to her but she behav'd so oddly that I had not Power to stop her She ask'd If she should call me again He said Yes and then No let her go it is best for her and me too that she shall go now I have given her Warning But where she had it I can't tell but I never met with the Fellow of her in my Life at any Age She said he had order'd her not to tell me all But she believ'd he never would offer any thing to me  again and I might stay she fansy'd if I would beg it as a Favour tho' she was not  sure  neither  I stay dear Mrs  Jervis  said I why 'tis the best News that could have come to me that he will let me go I do nothing but long to go back again to my  Poverty  and  Distress  as he said I should for tho' I am sure of the Poverty I shall not have half the Distress I have had for some Months past I'll assure you  Mrs  Jervis  dear good Soul wept over me and said Well well  Pamela  I did not think I had shew'd so little Love to you as that you should express so much Joy to leave me I am sure I never had a Child half so dear to me as you  I wept to hear her so good to me as indeed she has always been and said What would you have me  to do  dear Mrs  Jervis  I love you next to my own Father and Mother and to leave you is the chief Concern I have at quitting this Place but I am sure it is certain Ruin if I stay After such Offers and such Threatenings and his comparing himself to a wicked Ravisher in the very Time of his last Offer and making a Jest of me that we should make a pretty Story in Romance can I stay and be safe Has he not demean'd himself twice And it behoves me to beware of the third time for fear he should lay his Snares surer for mayhap he did not expect a poor Servant would resist her Master so much And must it not be look'd upon as a sort of Warrant for such Actions if I stay after this For I think when one of our Sex finds she is attempted it is an Encouragement to a Person to proceed if one puts one's self in the Way of it when one can help it and it shews one can forgive what in short ought  not  to be forgiven Which is no small Countenance to foul Actions I'll assure you  She hugg'd me to her and said  I'll assure you  Prettyface where gottest thou all thy Knowledge and thy good Notions at these Years Thou art a Miracle for thy Age and I shall always love thee But do you  resolve  to leave us  Pamela  Yes my dear Mrs  Jervis  said I for as Matters stand how can I do otherwiseBut I'll do all the Duties of my Place first if I may And hope you'll give me a Character as to my Honesty that it may not be thought I was turn'd away for any Harm Ay that I will said she I will give thee such a Character as never Girl at thy Years deserv'd And I am sure said I I will always love and honour you as my third best Friend whereever I go or whatever becomes of me  And so we went to Bed and I never wak'd 'till 'twas Time to rise which I did as blythe as a Bird and went about my Business with great Pleasure  But I believe my Master is fearfully angry with me for he pass'd by me two or three times and would not speak to me and towards Evening he met me in the Passage going into the Garden and said such a Word to me as I never heard in my Life from him to Man Woman or Child for he first said This Creature's always in my way I think I said standing up as close as I could and the Entry was wide enough for a Coach too I hope I shan't be long in your Honour's Way Dn you said he that was the hard Word for a little Witch I have no Patience with you  I profess I trembled to hear him say so but I  saw  he was vex'd and as I am going away I minded it the less But I see my dear Parents that when a Person will do wicked Things it is no Wonder he will speak wicked Words And so I rest  Your dutiful Daughter  LETTER XIX  Dear Father and Mother  OUR  John  having no Opportunity to go your Way I write again and send both Letters at once I can't say yet when I shall get away nor how I shall come because Mrs  Jervis  shew'd my Master the Waistcoat I am flowering for him and he said It looks well enough I think the Creature had best stay till she has finish'd it  There is some private Talk carry'd on betwixt him and Mrs  Jervis  that she don't tell me of but yet she is very kind to me and I don't mistrust her at all I should be very base if I did But to be sure she must oblige him and keep all his lawful Commands and other I dare say she won't keep She is too good and loves me too well but  she  must stay when I am gone and so must get no Illwill  She has been at me again to ask to stay and humble myself as she calls it But what have I done Mrs  Jervis  said I If I have been a Saucebox and a Boldface and Pert and a Creature as he calls me have I not had Reason Do you think I should ever have forgot  myself  if he had not forgot to act as my  Master  Tell me from your own Heart dear Mrs  Jervis  said I if you think I could stay and be safe What would  you  think or how would  you  act in  my  Case  My dear  Pamela  said she and kiss'd me I don't know how I should act or what I should think I hope I should act as  you  do But I know nobody else that would My Master is a fine Gentleman he has a great deal of Wit and Sense and is admir'd as I know by half a dozen Ladies who would think  themselvs happy in his Addresses He has a noble Estate and yet I believe he loves my good Maiden tho' his Servant better than all the Ladies in the Land and he has try'd to overcome it because he knows you are so much his Inferior and 'tis my Opinion he finds he can't and that vexes his proud Heart and makes him resolve you shan't stay and so he speaks so to cross you when he sees you by Accident  Well but Mrs  Jervis  said I let me ask you if he can stoop to like such a poor Girl as I as perhaps he may for I have read of Things almost as strange from great Men to poor Damsels What can it be  for  He may condescend mayhap to think I may be good enough for his Harlot and those Things don't disgrace Men that ruin poor Women as the World goes And so if I was wicked enough he would keep me till I was undone and 'till his Mind changed for even wicked Men I have read soon grow weary of Wickedness of  one  Sort and love  Variety  Well then poor  Pamela  must be turn'd off and look'd upon as a vile abandon'd Creature and every body would despise her ay and  justly  too Mrs  Jervis  for she that can't keep her Virtue ought to live in Disgrace  But Mrs  Jervis  continued I let me tell you that I hope if I was sure he would always be kind to me and never turn me off at all that I shall have so much Grace as to hate and withstand his Temptations were he not only my Master but my King and that for the  Sin  's sake This my poor dear Parents have always taught me and I should be a sad wicked Creature indeed if for the sake of Riches or Favour I should forfeit my good Name yea and worse than any other young body of my Sex because I can so contentedly return to my Poverty again and think it less Disgrace to be oblig'd to wear Rags and  live upon Ryebread and Water as I used to do than to be a Harlot to the greatest Man in the World  Mrs  Jervis  lifted up her Hands and had her Eyes full of Tears God bless you my dear Love said she you are my Admiration and DelightHow shall I do to part with you  Well good Mrs  Jervis  said I let me ask you now You and he have had some Talk and you  mayn't  be suffer'd to tell me all But do you think if I was to ask to stay that he is sorry for what he has done ay and  asham'd  of it too for I am sure he ought considering his high Degree and my low Degree and how I have nothing in the World to trust to but my Honesty Do you think in  your own  Conscience now pray answer me truly that he would never offer any thing to me again and that I could be safe  Alas my dear Child said she don't put thy home Questions to me with that pretty becoming Earnestness in thy Look I know this that he is vex'd at what he has done he was vex'd the  first  time more vex'd the  second  time  Yes said I and so he will be vex'd I suppose the  third  and the  fourth  time too 'till he has quite ruin'd your poor Maiden and who will have Cause to be vex'd then  Nay  Pamela  said she don't imagine that I would be accessary to your Ruin for the World I only can say that he has yet done you no Hurt and 'tis no Wonder he should love you you are so pretty tho' so much beneath him But I dare swear for him he never will offer you any Force  You say said I that he was sorry for his  first  Offer in the Summerhouse well and how long did his Sorrow lastOnly 'till he found me by myself and then he was worse than before and so became  sorry  again  And if he has deign'd to love me and you say can't  help  it why he can't  help  it neither if he should have an Opportunity a  third  time to distresse me And I have read that many a Man has been asham'd of his Wickedness at a Repulse that never would had he succeeded Besides Mrs  Jervis  if he really intends to offer no  Force  What does  that  meanWhile you say he can't  help  liking me for  Love  it cannot beDoes it not imply that he hopes to ruin me by my own  Consent  I  think  said I and I hope I should have Grace to  do  so that I should not give way to his Temptations on  any  Account but it would be very presumptuous in me to rely upon my own Strength against a Gentleman of his Qualifications and Estate and who is my  Master  and thinks himself intitled to call me Boldface and what not only for standing on my necessary Defence And that where the Good of my Soul and Body and my Duty to God and my Parents are all concern'd How then Mrs  Jervis  said I can I  ask  or  wish  to stay  Well well says she as he seems very desirous you should  not  stay I hope it is from a good Motive for fear he should be tempted to disgrace himself as well as you No no Mrs  Jervis  said I I have thought of that too for I would be glad to think of him with that Duty that becomes me But then he would have let me gone to Lady  Davers  and not have hinder'd my Preferment And he would not have said I should return to my  Poverty  and  Distress  when by his Mother's Goodness I had been lifted out of it but that he intended to fright me and  punish  me as he thought for not complying with his Wickedness and this shews me enough what I have to expect from his future Goodness except I will deserve it at his own dear dear Price  She was silent and I said Well there's no more to be said I must go that's certain All my Concern will be how to part with  you  And indeed next to you with  every body  for all my Fellowservants have loved me and you and they will cost me a Sigh and a Tear too nowandthen I am sure And so I fell acrying I could not help it For it is a pleasant Thing to one to be in a House among a great many Fellowservants and be belov'd by them all  Nay I should have told you before now how kind and civil Mr  Longman  our Steward is vastly courteous indeed on all Occasions And he said once to Mrs  Jervis  he wish'd he was a young Man for my sake I should be his Wife and he would settle all he had upon me on Marriage and you must know he is reckon'd worth a Power of Money  I take no Pride in this but bless God and your good Example my dear Parents that I have been enabled so to carry myself as to have every body's good Word Not but that our Cook one Day who is a little snappish and cross sometimes said once to me Why this  Pamela  of  ours  goes as fine as a Lady See what it is to have a fine Face I wonder what the Girl will come to at last  She was hot with her Work and I sneak'd away for I seldom go down into the Kitchen and I heard the Butler say Why  Jane  nobody has your good Word What has Mrs  Pamela  done to you I am sure  she  offends nobody And what said the peevish Wench have I said to her  Foolatum  but that she was pretty They quarrell'd afterwards I heard I was sorry for it but troubled myself no more about it Forgive this silly Prattle from  Your dutiful Daughter  O I forgot to say that I would stay to finish the Waistcoat I never did a prettier Piece of Work and I am up early and late to gee it done for I long to come to you  LETTER XX  My dear Father and Mother  I Did not send my last Letters so soon as I hop'd because  John  whether my Master mistrusts or no I can't say had been sent to Lady  Davers  's instead of  Isaac  who used to go and I could not be so free with nor so well trust  Isaac  tho' he is very civil to me too So I was forced to stay 'till  John  return'd  As I may not have Opportunity to send again soon and yet as I know you keep my Letters and read them over and over so  John  told me when you have done Work so much does your Kindness make you love all that comes from your poor Daughter and as it may be some little Pleasure to me mayhap to read them myself when I am come to you to remind me what I have gone thro' and how great God's Goodness has been to me which I hope will further strengthen my good Resolutions that I may not hereafter from my bad Conduct have Reason to condemn myself from my own Hand as it were For all these Reasons I say I will write as I have Time and as Matters happen and send the Scribble to you as I have Opportunity and if I don't every time in Form subscribe as I ought I am sure you will always believe that it is not for want of Duty So  I will begin where I left off about the Talk between Mrs  Jervis  and me for me to ask to stay  Unknown to Mrs  Jervis  I put a Project as I may call it in Practice I thought with myself some Days ago Here I shall go home to my poor Father and Mother and have nothing on my Back that will be fit for my Condition for how should your poor Daughter look with a Silk Nightgown Silken Petticoats Cambrick Headcloaths fine Holland Linen lac'd Shoes that were my Lady's and fine Stockens And how in a little while must they have look'd like old Castoffs indeed and I look'd so for wearing them And People would have said for poor Folks are envious as well as rich See there Goody  Andrews  's Daughter turn'd home from her fine Place What a tawdry Figure she makes And how well that Garb becomes her poor Parents Circumstances And how would they look upon me thought I to myself when they come to be threadbare and worn out And how should I look even if I could get homespun Cloaths to dwindle into them one by one as I could get themMaybe an old Silk Gown and a Linseywoolsey Petticoat and the like So thought I I had better get myself at once 'quipt in the Dress that will become my Condition and tho' it may look but poor to what I have been us'd to wear of late Days yet it will serve me when I am with you for a good Holiday and  Sunday  Suit and what by a Blessing on my Industry I may perhaps make shift to keep up to  So as I was saying unknown to any body I bought of Farmer  Nichols  's Wife and Daughters a good sadcolour'd Stuff of their own Spinning enough to make me a Gown and two Petticoats and I made Robings and Facings of a pretty Bit of printed Calico I had by me  I had a pretty good Camblet quilted Coat that I thought might do tolerably well and I bought two Flanel Undercoats not so good as my Swanskin and fine Linen ones but what will keep me warm if any Neighbour should get me to go out to help 'em to milk nowandthen as sometimes I us'd to do formerly for I am resolv'd to do all your good Neighbours what Kindness I can and hope to make myself as much belov'd about you as I am here  I got some pretty good  Scots  Cloth and made me at Mornings and Nights when nobody saw me two Shifts and I have enough left for two Shirts and two Shifts for you my dear Father and Mother When I come home I'll make 'em for you and desire your Acceptance as my first Present  Then I bought of a Pedlar two pretty enough roundear'd Caps a little Strawhat and a Pair of knit Mittens turn'd up with white Calico and two Pair of ordinary blue Worsted Hose that make a smartish Appearance with white Clocks I'll assure you and two Yards of black Ribband for my Shift Sleeves and to serve as a Necklace and when I had 'em all come home I went and look'd upon them once in two Hours for two Days together For you must know tho' I lie with Mrs  Jervis  I keep my own little Apartment still for my Cloaths and nobody goes thither but myself You'll say I was no bad Housewife to have sav'd so much Money but my dear good Lady was always giving me something  I believ'd myself the more oblig'd to do this because as I was turn'd away for what my good Master thought Want of Duty and as he expected other Returns for his Presents than I intended to make him so I thought it was but just to leave his Presents behind me when I went away  for you know if I would not earn his Wages why should I have them  Don't trouble yourself now I think of it about the Four Guineas nor borrow to make them up for they were given me with some Silver as I told you as a Perquisite being what my Lady had about her when she dy'd and as I hope for no other Wages I am so vain as to think I have deserv'd them in the fourteen Months since my Lady's Death For she good Soul overpaid me before in Learning and other KindnessesHad  she  liv'd none of these Things might have happen'dBut I ought to be thankful 'tis no worse Every thing will turn about for the best that's my Confidence  So as I was saying I have provided a new and more suitable Dress and I long to appear in it more than ever I did in any new Cloaths in my Life for then I shall be soon after with you and at Ease in my MindBut mumI am  c  LETTER XXI  My dear Father and Mother  I WAS forc'd to break off for I fear'd my Master was coming but it prov'd to be only Mrs  Jervis  She came to me and said I can't endure you should be so much by yourself  Pamela  And I said I dread nothing so much as Company for my Heart was up at my Mouth now for fear my Master was coming But I always rejoice to see my dear Mrs  Jervis    Said she I have had a World of Talk with my Master about you I am sorry for it said I that I am made of so much Consequence as to be talk'd  of by him O said she I must not tell you all but you are of more Consequence to him than you think for  Or  wish  for said I for the Fruits of being of Consequence to him would make me of none to myself or any body else  Said she Thou art as witty as any Lady in the Land I wonder where thou gottest it But they must be poor Ladies with such great Opportunities I am sure if they have no more than IBut let that pass  I suppose said I that I am of so much Consequence however as to vex him if it be but to think he can't make a Fool of such a one as I and that is nothing at all but a Rebuke to the Pride of his high Condition which he did not expect and knows not how to put up with  There is something in that maybe said she but indeed  Pamela  he is very angry at you  too  and calls you twenty perverse Things wonders at his own Folly to have shewn you so much Favour as he calls it which he was first inclin'd to he says for his Mother's sake and would have persisted to shew you for your own if you was not your own Enemy  Nay now I shan't love you Mrs  Jervis  said I you are going to persuade me to ask to stay tho' you know the Hazards I runNo said she he says you  shall  go for he thinks it won't be for his Reputation to keep you But he wish'd don't speak of it for the World  Pamela  that he knew a Lady of Birth just such another as yourself in Person and Mind and he would marry her Tomorrow  I colour'd up to the Ears at this Word but said Yet if I was the Lady of Birth and he would offer to be rude first as he has twice done to poor me  I don't know whether I would have him For  she  that can bear an Insult of that kind I should think not worthy to be any Gentleman's Wife any more than  he  would be a Gentleman that would offer it  Nay now  Pamela  said she thou carriest thy Notions a great way Well dear Mrs  Jervis  said I very seriously for I could not help it I am more full of Fears than ever I have only to beg of you as one of the best Friends I have in the World to say nothing of my asking to stay To say my Master likes me when I know what End he aims at is Abomination to my Ears and I shan't think myself safe till I am at my poor Father's and Mother's  She was a little angry at me 'till I assured her that I had not the least Uneasiness on her Account but thought myself safe under her Protection and Friendship And so we dropt the Discourse for that Time  I hope to have finish'd this ugly Waistcoat in two Days after which I have only some Linen to get up and do something to and shall then let you know how I shall contrive as to my Passage for the heavy Rains will make it sad travelling on Foot But maybe I may get a Place to which is ten Miles of the Way in Farmer  Nichols  's close Cart for I can't sit a Horse well at all And maybe nobody will be suffer'd to see me on upon the Way But I hope to let you know more  From  c  LETTER XXII  My dear Father and Mother  ALL my Fellowservants have now some Notion that I am to go away but can't imagine for what Mrs  Jervis  tells them that my Father and Mother growing in Years cannot live without me and so I go to them to help to comfort their old Age but they seem not to believe it  What they found it out by was the Butler heard him say to me as I pass'd by him in the Entry leading to the Hall Who's that's  Pamela  Sir said I▪  Pamela  said he How long are  you  to stay here Only please your Honour said I till I have done the Waistcoat and it is almost done You might says he very roughly indeed have finished that long enough ago I should have thought Indeed and please your Honour said I I have work'd early and late upon it there is a great deal of Work in it  Work in it  said he yes you mind your Pen more than your Needle I don't want such idle Sluts to stay in my House  He seem'd startled when he saw the Butler As he enter'd the Hall where Mr  Jonathan  stood What do  you  here said heThe Butler was as much confounded as I for I never having been tax'd so roughly could not help crying sadly and got out of both their ways to Mrs  Jervis  and told my Complaint This Love said she is the Dl in how many strange Shapes does it make People shew themselves And in some the farthest from their Hearts  So one and then another has been since whispering Pray Mrs  Jervis  are we to lose Mrs  Pamela  as they always call me What has she done And  then she tells them as above about going home to you  She said afterwards to me Well  Pamela  you have made our Master from the sweetesttemper'd Gentleman in the World one of the most peevish But you have it in your Power to make him as sweettemper'd as ever tho' I hope you'll never do it on his Terms  This was very good in Mrs  Jervis  but it intimated that she thought as ill of his Designs as I and as she knew his Mind more than I it convinced me that I ought to get away as fast as I could  My Master came in just now to speak to Mrs  Jervis  about Houshold Matters having some Company to dine with him Tomorrow and I stood up and having been crying at his Roughness in the Entry I turn'd away my Face  You may well said he turn away your cursed Face I wish I had never seen it Mrs  Jervis  how long is she to be about this Waistcoat  Sir said I if your Honour had pleased I would have taken it with me and tho' it would be now finish'd in a few Hours I will do so still and remove this hated poor  Pamela  out of your House and Sight for ever  Mrs  Jervis  said he not speaking to me I believe this little Slut has the Power of Witchcraft if ever there was a Witch for she inchants all that come near her She makes even  you  who should know better what the World is think her an Angel of Light  I offer'd to go away for I believ'd he wanted me to ask to stay in my Place for all this his great Wrath and he said Stay here stay here when I bid you and snatch'd my Hand I trembled and said I will I will for he hurt my Fingers he grasped me so hard  He seem'd to have a mind to say something to me but broke off abruptly and said Begone And away I tripp'd as fast as I could and he and Mrs  Jervis  had a deal of Talk as she told me and among the rest he expressed himself vex'd to have spoken in Mr  Jonathan  's Hearing  Now you must know that Mr  Jonathan  our Butler is a very grave good sort of old Man with his Hair as white as Silver and an honest worthy Man he is I was hurrying out with a Flea in my Ear as the Saying is and going down Stairs into the Parlour met him He took hold of my Hand in a gentler manner tho' than my Master with both his and he said Ah sweet sweet Mrs  Pamela  what is it I heard just now I am sorry at my Heart but I am sure I will sooner believe  any body  in Fault than  you  Thank you Mr  Jonathan  said I but as you value your Place don't be seen speaking to such a one as me I cry'd too and slipt away as fast as I could from him for his own sake lest he should be seen to pity me  And now I will give you an Instance how much I am in Mr  Longman  's Esteem also  I had lost my Pen somehow and my Paper being written out I stepp'd to Mr  Longman  's our Steward's Office to beg him to give me a Pen or two and a Sheet or two of Paper He said Ay that I will my sweet Maiden And gave me three Pens some Wafers a Stick of Wax and twelve Sheets of Paper and coming from his Desk where be was writing he said Let me have a Word or two with you my sweet little Mistress for so these two good old Gentlemen often call me for I believe they love me dearly I hear bad News that we are going to lose you I hope it is not true Yes it is Sir said I but I was in Hopes it would not be known till I went away  What a Dl said he ails our Master of late I never saw such an Alteration in any Man in my Life He is pleas'd with nobody as I see And by what Mr  Jonathan  tells me just now he was quite out of the way with you What could  you  have done to him tro' Only Mrs  Jervis  is a very good Woman or I should have fear'd  she  had been your Enemy  No said I nothing like it Mrs  Jervis  is a just good Woman and next to my Father and Mother the best Friend I have in the WorldWell then said he it must be worse Shall I guess You are too  pretty  my sweet Mistress and maybe too  virtuous  Ah have I not hit it No good Mr  Longman  said I don't think any thing amiss of my Master he is cross and angry with me indeed that's true but I may have given Occasion for it maybe and because I am obliged to go to my Father and Mother rather than stay here mayhap he may think me ungrateful But you know Sir said I that a Father and Mother's Comfort is the dearest thing to a good Child that can be Sweet Excellence said he this becomes  you  but I know the World and Mankind too well tho' I must hear and see and say nothing And a Blessing attend my little Sweeting said he whereever you go And away went I with a Curt'sy and Thanks  Now this pleases one my dear Father and Mother to be so belov'dHow much better by good Fame and Integrity is it to get every one's good Word but  one  than by  pleasing that one  to make  every one else  one's Enemy and be an execrable Creature besides I am  c  LETTER XXIII  My dear Father and Mother  WE had a great many neighbouring Gentlemen and their Ladies this Day at Dinner and my Master made a fine Entertainment for them And  Isaac  and Mr  Jonathan  and  Benjamin  waited at Table And  Isaac  tells Mrs  Jervis  that the Ladies will byandby come to see the House and have the Curiosity to see me for it seems they said to my Master when the Jokes flew about Well Mr  B  we understand you have a Servantmaid who is the greatest Beauty in the County and we promise ourselves to see her before we go  The Wench is well enough said he but no such Beauty as you talk of I'll assure ye She was my Mother's Waitingmaid who on her Deathbed engag'd me to be kind to her She is young and every thing is  pretty  that is  young    Ay ay said one of the Ladies that's true but if your Mother had  not  recommended her so strongly there is so much Merit in Beauty that I make no doubt such a fine Gentleman would have wanted no such strong Inducement to be kind  They all laugh'd at my Master And he it seems laugh'd for Company but said I don't know how it is but I see with different Eyes from other People for I have heard much more Talk of her Prettiness than I think it deserves She is well enough as I said but I think her greatest Excellence is that she is humble and courteous and faithful and makes all her Fellowservants love her My Housekeeper in particular doats upon her and you know Ladies she is a Woman of Discernment And as for Mr  Longman  and  Jonathan  here if they thought  themselves young enough I am told they would fight for her Is it not true  Jonathan  Troth Sir said he an't please your Honour I never knew her Peer and all your Honour's Family are of the same Mind Do you hear now said my MasterWell said the Ladies we will make a Visit to Mrs  Jervis  byandby and hope to see this Paragon  I believe they are coming and will tell you more byandby I wish they had come and were gone Why can't they make their Game without me  Well these fine Ladies have been here and gone back again I would have been absent if I could and did step into the Closet so they saw me not when they came in  There were four of them Lady  Arthur  at the great white House on the Hill Lady  Brookes  Lady  Towers  and the other it seems a Countess of some hard Name I forget what  So Mrs  Jervis  says one of the Ladies how do you do We are all come to inquire after your Health I am much oblig'd to your Ladyships said Mrs  Jervis  Will your Ladyships please to sit down But said the Countess we are not  only  come to ask after Mrs  Jervis  's Health neither but we are come to see a Rarity besides Ay says Lady  Arthur  I have not seen your  Pamela  these two Years and they tell me she is grown wond'rous pretty in that Time  Then I wish'd I had not been in the Closet for when I came out they must needs know I heard them but I have often found that bashful Bodies owe themselves a Spite and frequently confound themselves more by endeavouring to avoid Confusion  Why yes says Mrs  Jervis Pamela  is very pretty indeed she's but in the Closet there  Pamela  pray  step hither I came out all cover'd with Blushes and they smil'd at one another  The Countess took me by the Hand Why indeed she was pleased to say Report has not been too lavish I'll assure you Don't be asham'd Child and star'd full in my Face I wish I had just such a Face to be asham'd of O how like a Fool I look'd  Lady  Arthur  said Ay my good  Pamela  I say as her Ladyship says Don't be so confus'd tho' indeed it becomes you too I think your good Lady departed made a sweet Choice of such a pretty Attendant She would have been mighty proud of you as she always was praising you had she liv'd till now  Ah Madam said Lady  Brookes  do you think that so  dutiful  a Son as our Neighbour who always  admir'd  what his Mother  lov'd  does not pride himself for all what he said at Table in such a pretty Maiden  She look'd with such a malicious sneering Countenance I cannot abide her  Lady  Towers  said with a free Air for it seems she is call'd a Wit Well Mrs  Pamela  I can't say I like you so well as these Ladies do for I should never care if you were  my  Servant to have  you  and your  Master  in the same House together Then they all set up a great Laugh  I know what I could have said if I durst But they are Ladiesand Ladies may say any thing  Says Lady  Towers  Can the pretty Image speak Mrs  Jervis  I vow she has speaking Eyes O you little Rogue said she and tapt me on the Cheek you seem born to undo or to be undone  God forbid and please your Ladyship said I it should be  either  I beg said I to withdraw for the Sense I have of my Unworthiness renders me unfit for such a Presence  I then went away with one of my best Curt'sies and Lady  Towers  said as I went out Prettily said  I vowAnd Lady  Brookes  said See that Shape I never saw such a Face and Shape in my Life why she must be better descended than you have told me  And so belike their Clacks ran for half an Hour in my Praises and glad was I when I got out of the Hearing of them  But it seems they went down with  such  a Story to my Master and so full of  me  ▪ that he had much ado to stand it but as it was very little to my Reputation I am sure I could take no Pride in it and I fear'd it would make no better for me This gives me another Cause for wishing myself out of this House  This is  Thursday  Morning and next  Thursday  I hope to set out for I have finish'd my Task and my Master is horrid cross And I am vex'd his Crossness affects me so If ever he had any Kindness towards me I believe he now hates me heartily  Is it not strange that Love borders so much upon Hate But this wicked Love is not like the true virtuous Love to be sure  That  and  Hatred  must be as far off as  Light  and  Darkness  And how must this Hate have been increased if he had met with a base Compliance after his wicked Will had been gratify'd  Well one may see by a little what a great deal means For if  Innocence  cannot attract common Civility what must  Guilt  expect when Novelty had ceas'd to have its Charms and Changeableness had taken place of it Thus we read in Holy Writ that wicked  Amnon  when he had ruin'd poor  Tamar  hated her more than ever he lov'd her and would have turn'd her out of Door  How happy am I to be turn'd out of Door with that sweet Companion my InnocenceO may that be always my Companion And while I presume  not upon my own Strength and am willing to avoid the Tempter I hope the Divine Grace will assist me  Forgive me that I repeat in my Letter Part of my hourly Prayer I owe every thing next to God's Goodness to your Piety and good Examples my dear Parents my dear  poor  Parents I will say because your  Poverty  is my  Pride  as your Integrity shall be my Imitation  As soon as I have din'd I will put on my new Cloaths I long to have them on I know I shall surprise Mrs  Jervis  with them for she shan't see me till I am fulldress'd  John  is come back and I'll soon send you some of what I have written I find he is going early in the Morning and so I'll close here that I am  Your most dutiful Daughter  Don't lose your Time in meeting me because I am so uncertain It is hard if somehow or other I can't get a Passage to you But maybe my Master won't refuse to let  John  bring me I can ride behind him I believe well enough for he is very careful and very honest and you know  John  as well as I for he loves you both Besides maybe Mrs  Jervis  can put me in some way  LETTER XXIV  Dear Father and Mother  I Shall write on as long as I stay tho' I should have nothing but Sillinesses to write for I know you divert yourselves on Nights with what I write  because it is mine  John  tells me how much you long for my coming but he says he told you he hop'd something would happen to hinder it  I am glad you did not tell him the Occasion of my coming away for  if  they should guess it were better so than to have it from you or me Besides I really am concern'd that my poor Master should cast such a Thought upon such a Creature as me for besides the Disgrace it has quite turn'd his Temper and I begin to think he likes me and can't help it and yet strives to conquer it and so finds no way but to be cross to me  Don't think me presumptuous and conceited for it is more my Concern than my Pride to see such a Gentleman so demean himself and lessen the Regard he used to have in the Eyes of all his Servants on my AccountBut I am to tell you of my new Dress today  And so when I had din'd up Stairs I went and lock'd myself into my little Room There I trick'd myself up as well as I could in my new Garb and put on my roundear'd ordinary Cap but with a green Knot however and my homespun Gown and Petticoat and plainleather Shoes but yet they are what they call  Spanish  Leather and my ordinary Hose ordinary I mean to what I have been lately used to tho' I shall think good Yarn may do very well for every Day when I come home A plain Muslin Tucker I put on and my black Silk Necklace instead of the  French  Necklace my Lady gave me and put the Earrings out of my Ears and when I was quite 'quipp'd I took my Straw Hat in my Hand with its two blue Strings and look'd about me in the Glass as proud as any thingTo say Truth I never lik'd myself so well in my Life  O the Pleasure of descending with Ease Innocence and ResignationIndeed there is nothing  like it An humble Mind I plainly see cannot meet with any very shocking Disappointment let Fortune's Wheel turn round as it will  So I went down to look for Mrs  Jervis  to see how she lik'd me  I met as I was upon the Stairs our  Rachel  who is the Housemaid and she made me a low Curt'sy and I found did not know me So I smil'd and went to the Housekeeper's Parlour And there sat good Mrs  Jervis  at Work making a Shift And would you believe it she did not know me at first but rose up and pull'd off her Spectacles and said Do you want me forsooth I could not help laughing and said Heyday Mrs  Jervis  what don't you know meShe stood all in Amaze and look'd at me from Top to Toe Why you surprise me said she what  Pamela  thus metamorphos'd How came this about  As it happen'd in stept my Master and my Back being to him he thought it was a Stranger speaking to Mrs  Jervis  and withdrew again and did not hear her ask If his Honour had any Commands with herShe turn'd me about and about and I shew'd her all my Dress to my Underpetticoat and she said sitting down Why I am all in Amaze I must sit down What can all this mean I told her I had no Cloaths suitable to my Condition when I return'd to my Father's and so it was better to begin here as I was soon to go away that all my Fellowservants might see I knew how to suit myself to the State I was returning to  Well said she I never knew the like of thee But this sad Preparation for going away for now I see you are quite in Earnest is what I know not how to get over O my dear  Pamela  how can I part with you  My Master rung in the Backparlour and so I withdrew and Mrs  Jervis  went to attend him It  seems he said to her I was coming in to let you know that I shall go to  Lincolnshire  and maybe to my Sister  Davers  's and be absent some Weeks But pray what pretty neat Damsel was with you She says she smiled and ask'd If his Honour did not know who it was No said he I never saw her before Farmer  Nichols  or Farmer  Brady  have neither of them such a tight prim Lass for a Daughter have theyTho' I did not see her Face neither said he If your Honour won't be angry said she I will introduce her into your Presence for I think says she she outdoes our  Pamela    Now I did not thank her for this as I told her afterwards for it brought a great deal of Trouble upon me as well as Crossness as you shall hear That can't be he was pleased to say But if you can find an Excuse for it let her come in  At that she stept to me and told me I must go in with her to my Master but said she for Goodness sake let him find you out for he don't know you O fie Mrs  Jervis  said I how could you serve me so Besides it looks too free both  in me  and  to him  I tell you said she you  shall  come in and pray don't reveal yourself till he finds you out  So I went in foolish as I was tho' I must have been seen by him another time if I had not then And she would make me take my Strawhat in my Hand  I dropt a low Curt'sy but said never a Word I dare say he knew me as soon as he saw my Face but was as cunning as  Lucifer  He came up to me and took me by the Hand and said Whose pretty Maiden are youI dare say you are  Pamela  's Sister you are so like her So neat so clean so pretty Why Child you far surpass your Sister  Pamela  I was all Confusion and would have spoken but he took me about the Neck Why said he you are very pretty Child I would not be so free with your  Sister  you may believe but I must kiss  you    O Sir said I I am  Pamela  indeed I am Indeed I am  Pamela her own self  He kissed me for all I could do and said Impossible you are a lovelier Girl by half than  Pamela  and sure I may be innocently free with you tho' I would not do her so much Favour  This was a sad Bite upon me indeed and what I could not expect and Mrs  Jervis  look'd like a Fool as much as I for her Officiousness At last I got away and ran out of the Parlour most sadly vex'd as you may well think  He talk'd a good deal to Mrs  Jervis  and at last order'd me to come in to him Come in said he you little Villain for so he call'd me good Sirs what a Name was there Who is it you put your Tricks upon I was resolved never to honour your Unworthines said he with so much Notice again and so you must disguise yourself to attract me and yet pretend like an Hypocrite as you are  I was out of Patience then Hold good Sir said I don't impure Disguise and Hypocrisy to me above all things for hate them both mean as I am I have put on no DisguiseWhat aplague said he for that was his Word do you mean then by this DressWhy and please your Honour said I I mean one of the honestest things in the World I have been in Disguise indeed ever since my good Lady your Mother took me from my poor Parents I came to her Ladyship so poor and mean that these Cloaths I have on are a princelySuit to those I had then And her Goodness heap'd upon me rich Cloaths and other Bounties And as I am now returning to my poor Parents again so soon I cannot  wear those good things without being whooted at and so have bought what will be more suitable to my Degree and be a good Holiday Suit too when I get home  He then took me in his Arms and presently push'd me from him Mrs  Jervis  said he take the little Witch from me I can neither bear nor forbear her Strange Words theseBut stay you shan't go Yet begoneNo come back again  I thought he was mad for my Share for he knew not what he would have But I was going however and he stept after me and took hold of my Arm and brought me in again I am sure he made my Arm black and blue for the Marks are upon it still Sir Sir said I pray have Mercy I will I will come in  He sat down and look'd at me and as I thought afterwards as sillily as such a poor Girl as I At last he said Well Mrs  Jervis  as I was telling you you may permit her to stay a little longer till I see if my Sister  Davers  will have her if mean time she humble herself and ask this as a Favour and is sorry for her Pertness and the Liberty she has taken with my Character out of the House and in the House Your Honour indeed told me so said Mrs  Jervis  but I never found her inclinable to think herself in a Fault Pride and Perverseness said he with a Vengeance Yet this is your DoatingpieceWell for once I'll submit myself to tell you Hussy said he to me you may stay a Fortnight longer till I see my Sister  Davers  Do you hear what I say to you Statue Can you neither speak nor be thankfulYour Honour frights me so said I that I can hardly speak But I will venture to say that I have only to beg as a Favour that I may go to my Father and MotherWhy  Fool said he won't you like to go to wait on my Sister  Davers  Sir said I I was once fond of that Honour but you were pleased to say I might be in Danger from her Ladyship's Nephew or he from me Dd Impertinence said he do you hear Mrs  Jervis  do you hear how she retorts upon me Was ever such matchless Assurance  I then fell a weeping for Mrs  Jervis  said Fie  Pamela  fie And I said My Lot is very hard indeed I am sure I would hurt nobody and I have been it seems guilty of Indiscretions which have cost me my Place and my Master's Favour and so have been turn'd away And when the Time is come that I should return to my poor Parents I am not suffered to go quietly Good your Honour what have I done that I must be used worse than if I had robb'd you Robb'd me said he why so you have Hussy you  have  robb'd me Who I Sir said I have I robb'd you Why then you are a Justice of Peace and may send me to Gaol if you please and bring me to a Tryal for my Life If you can prove that I have robb'd you I am sure I ought to die  Now I was quite ignorant of his Meaning tho' I did not like it when it was afterwards explain'd neither and well thought I what will this come to at last if poor  Pamela  is esteem'd a Thief Then I thought in an Instant how I should shew my Face to my honest poor Parents if I was but suspected  But Sir said I let me ask you but one Question and pray don't let me be called Names for it for I don't mean disrespectfully Why if I have done amiss am I not left to be discharged by your Housekeeper as the other Maids have been And if  Jane  or  Rachel  or  Hannah  were to offend would your Honour stoop to take Notice of them And why should you so demean yourself to take Notice of  me Pray Sir if I have not been worse than others why should I suffer more than others and why should I not be turn'd away and there's an End of it For indeed I am not of Consequence enough for my Master to concern himself and be angry about such a Creature as me  Do you hear Mrs  Jervis  cry'd he again how pertly I am interrrogated by this saucy Slut Why Saucebox says he did not my good Mother desire me to take care of you And have you not been always distinguish'd by me above a common Servant And does your Ingratitude upbraid me for this  I said something mutteringly and he vow'd he would hear it I begg'd Excuse but he insisted upon it Why then said I if your Honour must know I said That my good Lady did not desire your Care to extend to the  Summerhouse  and her  Dressingroom    Well this was a little saucy you'll sayAnd he flew into such a Passion that I was forced to run sor it and Mrs  Jervis  said It was happy I got out of his Way  Why what makes him provoke one so then I'm almost sorry for it but I would be glad to get away at any rate For I begin to be more fearful now  Just now Mr  Jonathan  sent me these Lines Bless me what shall I do  "Dear Mrs  Pamela  Take care of yourself for  Rachel  heard my Master say to Mrs  Jervis  who she believes was pleading for you Say no more Mrs  Jervis  for by G I will have her Burn this instantly"  O pray for your poor Daughter I am called to go tobed by Mrs  Jervis  for it is past Eleven and I am sure she shall hear of it for all this is owing to her tho' she did not mean any Harm But I have  been and am in a strange Fluster and I suppose too she'll say I have been full pert  O my dear Father and Mother Power and Riches never want Advocates But poor Gentlewoman she cannot live without him And he has been very good to her  So Goodnight Maybe I shall send this in the Morning but maybe not so won't conclude tho' yet I must say I am with great Apprehensions  Your most dutiful Daughter  LETTER XXV  My dear Parents  O Let me take up my Complaint and say Never was poor Creature so unhappy and so barbarously used as poor  Pamela  O my dear Father and Mother my Heart's just broke I can neither write as I should do nor let it alone for to whom but you can I vent my Griefs and keep my poor Heart from bursting Wicked wicked Man I have no Patience left me But yet don't be frighted for I hope I hope I am honest But if my Head and my Heart will let me you shall hear allIs there no Constable nor Headborough tho' to take me out of his House for I am sure I can safely swear the Peace against him But alas he is greater than any Constable and is a Justice himself such a Justice deliver me fromBut God Almighty I hope in time will right me For he knows the Innocence of my Heart  John  went your way in the Morning but I have been too much distracted to send by him and have  seen nobody but Mrs  Jervis  and  Rachel  and one I hate to see And indeed I hate now to see any body Strange things I have to tell you that happen'd since last Night that good Mr  Jonathan  's Letter and my Master's Harshness put me into such a Fluster But I will no more  preambulate    I went to Mrs  Jervis  's Chamber and O my dear Father and Mother my wicked Master had hid himself base Gentleman as he is in her Closet where she has a few Books and Chest of Drawers and suchlike I little suspected it tho' I used till this sad Night always to look into that Closet and another in the Room and under the Bed ever since the Summerhouse Trick but never found any thing and so I did not do it then being fully resolved to be angry with Mrs  Jervis  for what had happened in the Day and so thought of nothing else  I sat myself down on one Side of the Bed and she on the other and we began to undress ourselves but she on that Side next the wicked Closet that held the worst Heart in the World So said Mrs  Jervis  you won't speak to me  Pamela  I find you are angry with me Why Mrs  Jervis  said I so I am a little 'tis a Folly to deny it You see what I have suffer'd by your forcing me in to my Master And a Gentlewoman of your Years and Experience must needs know that it was not fit for me to pretend to be any body else for my own sake nor with regard to my Master  But said she who would have thought it would have turn'd out so Ay said I little thinking who heard me  Lucifer  always is ready to promote his own Work and Workmen You see presently what Use he made of it pretending not to know me on purpose to be free with me And when he took upon himself to know me to quarrel with me and use me hardly And you too said I to cry Fie fie  Pamela  cut me to the Heart For that encouraged him  Do you think my Dear said she that I would encourage him I never said so to you before but since you force it from me I must tell you that ever since you consulted me I have used my utmost Endeavours to divert him from his wicked Purposes And he has promised fair but to say all in a Word he doats upon you and I begin to see it is not in his Power to help it  I luckily said nothing of the Note from Mr  Jonathan  for I began to suspect all the World almost But I said to try Mrs  Jervis  Well then what would you have me do You see he is for having me wait on Lady  Davers  now  Why I'll tell you freely my dear  Pamela  said she and I trust to your Discretion to conceal what I say My Master has been often desiring me to put you upon asking him to let you stay  Yes said I Mrs  Jervis  let me interrupt you I will tell you why I could not think of that It was not the Pride of my  Heart  but the Pride of my  Honesty  For what must have been the Case Here my Master has been very rude to me once and twice and you say he cannot help it though he pretends to be sorry for it Well he has given me Warning to leave my Place and uses me very harshly perhaps to frighten me to his Purposes as he supposes I would be fond of staying as indeed I should if I could be safe for I love you and all the House and value him if he would act as my Master Well then as I know his Designs and that he owns he cannot help it must I not have ask'd to stay knowing he would attempt me again for all you could assure me of was he would do nothing by  Force  so I a poor weak Girl was to be left to my own Strength And was not this  to  allow  him to tempt me as one may say and to encourage him to go on in his wicked Devices How then Mrs  Jervis  could I ask or wish to stay  You say well my dear Child says she and you have a Justness of Thought above your Years and for all these Considerations and for what I have heard this Day after you ran away and I am glad you went as you did I cannot persuade you to stay and I shall be glad which is what I never thought I could have said that you were well at your Father's for if Lady  Davers  will entertain you she may as well have you from thence as here There's my good Mrs  Jervis  said I God will bless you for your good Counsel to a poor Maiden that is hard beset But pray what did he say when I was gone Why says she he was very angry with you But he would hear it I said I I think it was a little bold but then he provoked me to it And had not my Honesty been in the Case I would not by any means have been so saucy Besides Mrs  Jervis  consider it was the Truth if he does not love to hear of the  Summerhouse  and the  Dressingroom  why should he not be ashamed to continue in the same Mind But said she when you had muttered this to yourself you might have told him any thing else Well said I I cannot tell a wilful Lye and so there's an End of it But I find you now give him up and think there's Danger in staying Lord bless me I wish I was well our of the House so it was at the Bottom of a wet Ditch on the wildest Common in  England    Why said she it signifies nothing to tell you all he said but it was enough to make me fear you would not be so safe as I could wish and upon my Word  Pamela  I don't wonder he loves you for without Flattery you are a charming Girl and I never saw you look more lovely in my Life than in  that same new Dress of yours And then it was such a Surprize upon us all I believe truly you owe some of your Danger to the lovely  Appearance  you made Then said I I wish the Cloaths in the Fire I expected  no  Effect from them but if  any  a quite contrary one  Hush said I Mrs  Jervis  did you not hear something stir in the Closet No silly Girl said she your Fears are always awake But indeed said I I think I heard something rustle Maybe says she the Cat may be got there But I hear nothing  I was hush but she said Pr'ythee my good Girl make haste tobed See if the Door be fast So I did and was thinking to look in the Closet but hearing no more Noise thought it needless and so went again and sat myself down on the Bedside and went on undressing myself And Mrs  Jervis  being by this time undress'd stept into Bed and bid me hasten for she was sleepy  I don't know what was the Matter but my Heart sadly misgave me but Mr  Jonathan  's Note was enough to make it do so with what Mrs  Jervis  had said I pulled off my Stays and my Stockens and all my Cloaths to an Underpetticoat and then hearing a rustling again in the Closet I said Heaven protect us but before I say my Prayers I must look into this Closet And so was going to it slipshod when O dreadfull out rush'd my Master in a rich silk and silver Morning Gown  I scream'd and ran to the Bed and Mrs  Jervis  scream'd too and he said I'll do you no Harm if you forbear this Noise but otherwise take what follows  Instantly he came to the Bed for I had crept into it to Mrs  Jervis  with my Coat on and my Shoes and taking me in his Arms said Mrs  Jervis  rise and just step up Stairs to keep the Maids from  coming down at this Noise I'll do no Harm to this Rebel  O for Heaven's sake for Pity's sake Mrs  Jervis  said I if I am not betray'd don't leave me and I beseech you raise all the House No said Mrs  Jervis  I will not stir my dear Lamb I will not leave you I wonder at you Sir said she and kindly threw herself upon my Coat clasping me round the Waist you shall not hurt this Innocent said she for I will lose my Life in her Defence Are there not said she enough wicked ones in the World for your base Purpose but you must attempt such a Lamb as this  He was desperate angry and threaten'd to throw her out of the Window and to turn her out of the House the next Morning You need not Sir said she for I will not stay in it God defend my poor  Pamela  till Tomorrow and we will both go togetherSays he let me but expostulate a Word or two with you  Pamela  Pray  Pamela  said Mrs  Jervis  don't hear a Word except he leaves the Bed and goes to the other End of the Room Ay out of the Room said I expostulate Tomorrow if you must expostulate  I found his Hand in my Bosom and when my Fright let me know it I was ready to die and I sighed and screamed and fainted away And still he had his Arms about my Neck and Mrs  Jervis  was about my Feet and upon my Coat And all in a cold clammy Sweat was I  Pamela Pamela  said Mrs  Jervis  as she tells me since Oh and gave another Shriek my poor  Pamela  is dead for certain And so to be sure I was for a time for I knew nothing more of the Matter one Fit following another till about three Hours after as it prov'd to be I found myself in Bed and Mrs  Jervis  sitting up on one side with her Wrapper about her and  Rachel  on the other and no Master for the wicked Wretch was gone But I was so overjoy'd that  I hardly could believe myself and I said which were my first Words Mrs  Jervis  Mrs  Rachel  can I be  sure  it is you Tell me can IWhere have I been Hush my Dear said Mrs  Jervis  you have been in Fit after Fit I never saw any body so frightful in my Life  By this I judg'd Mrs  Rachel  knew nothing of the Matter and it seems my wicked Master had upon Mrs  Jervis  's second Noise on my fainting away slipt out and as if he had come from his own Chamber disturb'd by the Screaming went up to the Maids Room who hearing the Noise lay trembling and afraid to stir and bid them go down and see what was the Matter with Mrs  Jervis  and me And he charg'd Mrs  Jervis  and promised to forgive her for what she had said and done if she would conceal the Matter So the Maids came down for the Men lie in the Outhouses and all went up again when I came to myself a little except  Rachel  who staid to sit up with me and bear Mrs  Jervis  Company I believe they all guess the Matter to be bad enough tho' they dare not say any thing  When I think of my Danger and the Freedoms he actually took tho' I believe Mrs  Jervis  saved me from worse and she says he did tho' what can I think who was in a Fit and knew nothing of the Matter I am almost distracted  At first I was afraid of Mrs  Jervis  but I am fully satisfy'd she is very good and I should have been lost but for her and she takes on grievously about it What would have become of me had she gone out of the Room to still the Maids as he bid her He'd certainly have shut her out and then Mercy on me what would have become of your poor  Pamela  I must leave off a little for my Eyes and my Head are sadly bad This was a dreadful Trial This was  the worst of all Oh that I was out of the Power of this dreadfully wicked Man Pray for  Your distressed Daughter  LETTER XXV  My dear Father and Mother  I Did not rise till Ten o'Clock and I had all the Concerns and Wishes of the Family and Multitudes of Inquiries about me My wicked Master went out early to hunt but left Word he would be in to Breakfast And so he was  He came up to our Chamber about Eleven and had nothing to do to be sorry for he was our  Master  and so put on sharp Anger at first  I had great Emotions at his entering the Room and threw my Apron over my Head and fell a crying as if my Heart would break  Mrs  Jervis  said he since I know  you  and you  me  so well I don't know how we shall live together for the future Sir said she I will take the Liberty to say what I think is best for both I have so much Grief that you should attempt to do any Injury to this poor Girl and especially in my Chamber that I should think myself accessary to the Mischief if I was not to take Notice of it Tho' my Ruin therefore may depend upon it I desire not to stay but pray let poor  Pamela  and me go together With all my Heart said he and the sooner the better She fell a crying I find says he this Girl has made a Party of the whole House in her Favour against me Her Innocence deserves it of us all said she very kindly And I never could have thought that the Son of my dear good Lady departed  could have so forfeited his Honour as to endeavour to destroy a Virtue he ought to protect No more of this Mrs  Jervis  said he I will not bear it As for  Pamela  she has a lucky Knack at falling into Fits when she pleases But the cursed Yellings of you both made me not myself I intended no Harm to her as I told you both if you'd have left your Squallings and I did no Harm neither but to myself for I raised a Hornet's Nest about my Ears that as far as I know may have stung to Death my Reputation Sir said Mrs  Jervis  then I beg Mr  Longman  may take my Accounts and I will go away as soon as I can As for  Pamela  she is at her Liberty I hope to go away next  Thursday  as she intends  I sat still for I could not speak nor look up and his Presence discomposed me extremely but I was sorry to hear myself the unhappy Occasion of Mrs  Jervis  's losing her Place and hope that may be still made up  Well said he let Mr  Longman  make up your Accounts as soon as you will and Mrs  Jewkes  who is his Housekeeper in  Lincolnshire  shall come hither in your Place and won't be less obliging I dare say than  you  have been Said she I have never disoblig'd you till now and let me tell you Sir if you knew what belong'd to your own Reputation or Honour No more no more said he of these antiquated Topicks I have been no bad Friend to you and I shall always esteem you tho' you have not been so faithful to my Secrets as I could have wish'd and have laid me open to this Girl which has made her more afraid of me than she had Occasion Well Sir said she after what passed Yesterday and last Night I think I went rather too far in Favour of your Injunctions than otherwise and I should have deserv'd every body's Censure as the basest of Creatures had I been capable of contributing to your lawless Attempts Still Mrs  Jervis    still reflecting upon me and all for imaginary Faults for what Harm have I done the Girl I won't bear it I'll assure you But yet in Respect to my Mother I am willing to part friendly with you Tho' you ought both of you to reflect on the Freedom of your Conversation in relation to me which I should have resented more than I do but that I am conscious I had no Business to demean myself so as to be in your Closet where I might have expected to hear a Multitude of impertinence between you  Well Sir said she you have no Objection I hope to  Pamela  's going away on  Thursday  next You are mighty solicitous said he about  Pamela  But no not I let her go as soon as she will She is a naughty Girl and has brought all this upon herself and upon me more Trouble than she can have had from me But I have overcome it all and will never concern myself about her  I have a Proposal made me added he since I have been out this Morning that I shall go near to embrace and so wish only that a discreet Use may be made of what is past and there's an End of every thing with me as to  Pamela  I'll assure you  I clasp'd my Hands together thro' my Apron overjoy'd at this tho' I was soon to go away For naughty as he has been to me I wish his Prosperity with all my Heart for my good old Lady's sake  Well  Pamela  said he you need not now be afraid to speak to me tell me what you lifted up your Hands at I said not a Word Says he If you like what I have said give me your Hand upon it I held my Hand upon my Apron for I could not speak to him and he took hold of it and pressed it tho' less hard than he did my Arm the Day before What does the little Fool cover her Face for said he Pull your Apron away and let me see how  you look after your Freedom of Speech of me last Night No wonder you're ashamed to see me You know you were very free with my Character  I could not stand this harbarous Insult at I took it to be considering his Behaviour to me and I then spoke and said O the Difference between the Minds of thy Creatures good God How shall some be cast down in their Innocence while others shall triumph in their Guilt  And so saying I went up Stairs to my Chamber and wrote all this for tho' he vex'd me at his Taunting yet I was pleased to hear he was likely to be marry'd and that his wicked Intentions were so happily overcome as to me and this made me a little easier And I hope I have pass'd the Worst or else it is very hard And yet I shan't think myself at Ease quite till I am with you For methinks after all his Repentance and Amendment are mighty suddenly resolv'd upon But the Divine Grace is not confin'd to Space and Remorse may and I hope has smitten him to the Heart at once for his Injuries to poor me Yet I won't be too secure neither  Having Opportunity I send now what I know will grieve you to the Heart But I hope I shall bring my next Scribble myself and so conclude tho' half brokenhearted  Your everdutiful Daughter  LETTER XXVI  Dear Father and Mother  I Am glad I desir'd you not to meet me and  John  says you won't for he says he told you he is sure I shall get a Passage well enough either behind some one of my Fellowservants on Horseback or by Farmer  Nichols  's Means But as for the Chariot he talk'd to you of I can't expect that Favour to be sure and I should not care for it because it would look so much above me But Farmer  Brady  they say has a Chaise with one Horse and we hope to borrow that or hire it rather than fail tho' Money runs a little lowish after what I have laid out but I don't care to say so here tho' I warrant I might have what I would of Mrs  Jervis  or Mr  Jonathan  or Mr  Longman  but then how shall I pay it you'll say And besides I don't love to be beholden  But the chief Reason I'm glad you don't set out to meet me is the Uncertainty for it seems I must stay another Week still and hope certainly to go  Thursday  after For poor Mrs  Jervis  will go at the same time she says and can't be ready before  Oh that I was once well with youTho' he is very civil too at present and not so cross as he was and yet he is as vexatious another way as you shall hear For Yesterday he had a rich Suit of Cloaths brought home which they call a Birthday Suit for he intends to go to  London  against next Birthday to see the Court and our Folks will have it he is to be made a Lord I wish they may make him an honest Man as he was always thought but I have not found it so Alas for me  And so as I was saying he had these Cloaths come home and he try'd them on And before he  pull'd them off he sent for me when nobody else was in the Parlour with him  Pamela  said he you are so neat and so nice in your own Dress AlacKaday I did'n't know I was that you must be a Judge of ours How are these Cloaths made Do they fit me I am no Judge said I and please your Honour but I think they look very fine  His Waistcoat stood an End with Gold Lace and he look'd very grand But what he did last has made me very serious and I could make him no Compliments Said he Why don't you wear your usual Cloaths Tho' I think every thing looks well upon you For I still continue in my new Dress I said I have no Cloaths Sir I ought to call my own but these And it is no Matter what such a one as I wears Said he Why you look very serious  Pamela  I see you can bear MaliceYes so I can Sir said I according to the Occasion Why said he your Eyes always look red I think Are you not a Fool to take my last Freedom so much at Heart I am sure you and that Fool Mrs  Jervis  frightened me by your hideous Squalling as much as I could frighten you That is all we had for it said I and if you could be so afraid of your own Servants knowing of your Attempts upon a poor unworthy Creature that is under your Protection while I stay surely your Honour ought to be more afraid of God Almighty in whose Presence we all stand in every Action of our Lives and to whom the Greatest as well as the Least must be accountable let them think what they list  He took my Hand in a kind of goodhumour'd Mockery and said Well said my pretty Preacher I When my  Lincolnshire  Chaplain dies I'll put thee on a Gown and Cassock and thou'lt make a good Figure in his Place I wish said I a little vex'd at his Jeer your Honour's Conscience would be your Preacher  and then you would need no other Chaplain Well well  Pamela  said he no more of this unfashionable Jargon I did not send for you so much for your Opinion of my new Suit as to tell you you are welcome to stay since Mrs  Jervis  desires it till she goes I welcome said I I am sure I shall rejoice when I am out of the House  Well said he you are an ungrateful Baggage but I am thinking it would be Pity with these fair soft Hands and that lovely Skin as he called it and took hold of my Hand that you should return again to hard Work as you must if you go to your Father's and so I would advise her to take a House in  London  and let Lodgings to us Members of Parliament when we come to Town and such a pretty  Daughter  as you may pass for will always fill her House and she'll get a great deal of Money  I was sadly vex'd at this barbarous Joke but was ready to cry before and I gush'd out into Tears and endeavouring to get my Hand from him but in vain said I can expect no better from such a rude Gentleman Your Behaviour Sir to me has been just of a Piece with these Words nay I will say't tho' you were to be ever so angryI angry  Pamela  No no said he I have overcome all that and as you are to go away I look upon you now as Mrs  Jervis  's Guest while you both stay and not as my Servant and so you may say what you will But I'll tell you  Pamela  why you need not take this Matter in such high Disdain IYou have a very pretty romantick Turn for Virtue and all that And I don't suppose but you'll hold it still and nobody will be able to prevail upon you But my Child fleeringly he spoke it do but consider what a fine Opportunity you will then have for a Tale every Day to good Mother  Jervis  and what Subjects for Letterwriting to your Father and Mother and what pretty Preachments you may hold forth to the young Gentlemen  Ad's my Hear I think it would be the best Thing you and she could do  You do well Sir said I to even your Wit to such a poor Maiden as me But Sir let me say that if you was not rich and great and I poor and little you would not insult me thus Let me ask you Sir if you think this becomes your fine Cloaths and a Master's Station Why so serious my pretty  Pamela  said he Why so grave And would kiss me but my Heart was full and I said Let me alone I  will  tell you if you was a King and said to me what you have done that you are no Gentleman And I won't stay to be used thus I will go to the next Farmer's and there wait for Mrs  Jervis  if she must go And I'd have you know Sir that I can stoop to the ordinariest Work of your Scullions for all these nasty soft Hands sooner than bear such ungentlemanly Imputations  Well said he I sent for you in in high good Humour but 'tis impossible to hold it with such an Impertinent However I'll keep my Temper But while I see you here pray don't put on those dismal grave Looks Why Girl you should forbear 'em if it were but for your Pridesake for the Family will think you are grieving to leave the House Then Sir said I I will try to convince them of the contrary as well as your Honour for I will endeavour to be more chearful while I stay for that very Reason  Well said he I will set this down by itself as the first Time that ever what I advis'd had any Weight with you And I will say said I as the first Advice you have given me of late that was fit to be follow'd I wish said he I'm almost asham'd to write it impudent Gentleman as he is I wish I had thee as  quick another Way  as thou art in thy Repartees And he laugh'd and I snatch'd my Hand from him  and I tripp'd away as fast as I could Ah thought I marry'd I'm sure 'tis time you were married or at this Rate no honest Maiden ought to live with you  Why dear Father and Mother to be sure he grows quite a Rake Well you see how easy it is to go from bad to worse when once People give way to Vice  How would my poor Lady had she liv'd have griev'd to see it But maybe he would have been better  then  Tho' it seems he told Mrs  Jervis  he had an Eye upon me in his Mother's Lifetime and he intended to let me know as much by the bye he told her Here's Shamelessness for you Sure the World must be near at an End for all the Gentlemen about are as bad as he almost as far as I can hear And see the Fruits of such bad Examples There is 'Squire  Martin  in the Grove has had three Lyingsin it seems in his House in three Months past one by himself and one by his Coachman and one by his Woodmen and yet he has turn'd none of them away Indeed how can he when they but follow his own vile Example There is he and two or three more such as he within ten Miles of us who keep Company and hunt with our fine Master truly and I suppose he's never the better for their Examples But Heaven bless me say I and send me out of this wicked House  But dear Father and Mother what Sort of Creatures must the Womenkind be do you think to give way to such Wickedness Why this it is that makes every one be thought of alike And alackaday what a World we live in for it is grown more a Wonder that the Men are  resisted  than that the Women  comply  This I suppose makes me such a Saucebox and Boldface and a Creature and all because I won't be a Saucebox and Boldface indeed  But I am sorry for these Things one don't know what Arts and Stratagems these Men may devise to gain their vile Ends and so I will think as well as I can of these poor Creatures and pity them For you see by my sad Story and narrow Escapes what Hardships poor Maidens go thro' whose Lot it is to go out to Service especially to Houses where there is not the Fear of God and good Rule kept by the Heads of the Family  You see I am quite grown grave and serious so it becomes  Your dutiful Daughter  LETTER XXVII  Dear Father and Mother  JOHN  says you wept when you read my last Letter that he carry'd I am sorry you let him see that for they all mistrust already how Matters are and as it is no Credit that I have been  attempted  tho' it is that I have  resisted  yet I am sorry they have Cause to think so evil of my Master from any of us  Mrs  Jervis  has made up her Accounts with Mr  Longman  and will stay in her Place I am glad of it for her own sake and for my Master's for she has a good Master of him so indeed all have but poor me and he has a good Housekeeper in her  Mr  Longman  it seems took upon him to talk to my Master how faithful and careful of his Interests she was and how exact in her Accounts and he told him there was no Comparison between her Accounts and Mrs  Jewkers  's at the  Lincolnshire  Estate  He said so many fine Things it seems of Mrs  Jervis  that my Master sent for her in Mr  Longman  's Presence and said  Pamela  might come along with her I suppose to mortify me that I must go while she was to stay But as when I go away I am not to go with her nor was she to go with me so I did not matter it much only it would have been creditable to such a poor Girl that the Housekeeper would bear me Company if I went  Said he to her Well Mrs  Jervis  Mr  Longman  says you have made up your Accounts with him with your usual Fidelity and Exactness I had a good mind to make you an Offer of continuing with me if you can be a little sorry for your hasty Words which indeed were not so respectful as I have deserv'd at your Hands She seemed at a sad Loss what to say because Mr  Longman  was there and she could not speak of the Occasion of those Words which was  me    Indeed said Mr  Longman  I must needs say before your Face that since I have known my Master's Family I have never found such good Management in it nor so much Love and Harmony neither I wish the  Lincolnshire  Estate was as well serv'd No more of that said my Master but Mrs  Jervis  may stay if she will and here Mrs  Jervis  pray accept of this which at the Close of every Year's Accounts I will present you with besides your Salary as long as I find your Care so useful and agreeable And he gave her five Guineas She made him a low Curt'sy and thanking him look'd to me as if she would have spoken to me  He took her Meaning I believe for he said Indeed I love to encourage Merit and Obligingness Mr  Longman  but I can never be equally kind to those who don't deserve it at my Hands as to those who  do and then he look'd full at me Mr  Longman  continued he I said that Girl might come in with Mrs  Jervis  because they love to be always together For Mrs  Jervis  is very good to her and loves her as well as if she was her Daughter But else Mr  Longman  interrupting him said  Good  to Mrs  Pamela  Ay Sir and so she is to be sure But every body must be good to her for  He was going on But my Master said No more no more Mr  Longman  I see old Men are taken with pretty young Girls as well as other Folks and fair Looks hide many a Fault where a Person has the Art to behave obligingly Why and please your Honour said Mr  Longman  every bodyand was going on I believe to say something more in my Praise but he interrupted him and said Not a Word more of this  Pamela  I can't let her stay I'll assure you not only for her own Freedom of Speech but her Letterwriting of all the Secrets of my Family Ay said the good old Man I'm sorry for that too But SirNo more I say said my Master for my Reputation's so well known mighty fine thought I that I care not what any body writes or says of  me  But to tell you the Truth not that it need go further I think of changing my Condition soon and you know young Ladies of Birth and Fortune will chuse their own Servants and that's my chief Reason why  Pamela  can't stay As for the rest said he the Girl is a good sort of Body take her all together tho' I must needs say a little pert since my Mother's Death in her Answers and gives me two Words for one which I can't bear nor is there Reason I should you know Mr  Longman  No to be sure Sir said he but 'tis strange methinks she should be so mild and meek to every one of us in the House and forget herself so where she should shew most Respect Very true Mr  Longman  said he but so it is I'll assure you and it was  from her Pertness that Mrs  Jervis  and I had the Words And I should mind it the less but that the Girl there she stands I say it to her Face has Wit and Sense above her Years and knows better  I was in great Pain to say something but yet I knew not what before Mr  Longman  and Mrs  Jervis  look'd at me and walk'd to the Window to hide her Concern for me At last I said It is for  you  Sir to say what you please and for  me  only to say God bless your Honour  Poor Mr  Longman  falter'd in his Speech and was ready to cry Said my insulting Master to me Why pr'ythee  Pamela  now shew thyself as thou art before Mr  Longman  Can'st not give him a Specimen of that Pertness which thou hast exercis'd upon me sometimes  Did he not my dear Father and Mother deserve all the Truth to be told Yet I overcame myself so far as to say Well your Honour may play upon a poor Girl that you  can  answer you but  dare  not  Why pr'ythee now Insinuator said he say the worst you can before Mr  Longman  and Mrs  Jervis  I challenge the utmost of thy Impertinence and as you are going away and have the Love of every body I would be a little justify'd to my Family that you have no Reason to complain of Hardships from me as I have of pert saucy Answers from you besides exposing me by your Letters  Surely Sir said I I am of no Consequence equal to this in your Honour's Family that such a great Gentleman as you my Master should need to justify yourself about me I am glad Mrs  Jervis  stays with your Honour and I know I have  not deserv'd  to stay and more than that I don't  desire  to stay  Adsbobbers said Mr  Longman  and ran to me don't say so don't say so dear Mrs  Pamela  We all love you dearly and pray down of your Knees and  ask his Honour Pardon and we will all become Pleaders in a Body and I and Mrs  Jervis  too at the Head of it to beg his Honour's Pardon and to continue you at least till his Honour marries No Mr  Longman  said I I cannot ask nor will I stay if I might All I desire is to return to my poor Father and Mother and tho' I love you all I won't stay O welladay welladay said the good old Man I did not expect thisWhen I had got Matters thus far and had made all up for Mrs  Jervis  I was in Hopes to have got a double Holiday of Joy for all the Family in your Pardon too Well said my Master this is a little Specimen of what I told you Mr  Longman  You see there's a Spirit you did not expect  Mr  Jervis  told me after that she could stay no longer to hear me so hardly used and must have spoken had she stay'd what would never have been forgiven her so she went out I look'd after her to go too but my Master said Come  Pamela  give another Specimen I desire you to Mr  Longman  I am sure you must if you will but  speak  Well Sir said I since it seems your Greatness wants to be justified by my Lowness and I have no Desire you should suffer in the Sight of your Family I will say on my bended Knees and so I kneeled down that I have been a very faulty and a very ingrateful Creature to the  best  of Masters I have been very perverse and saucy and have deserv'd nothing at your Hands but to be turn'd out of your Family with Shame and Disgrace I therefore have nothing to say for myself but that I am not  worthy  to stay and so cannot wish to stay and  will  not stay And so God Almighty bless you and you Mr  Longman  and good Mrs  Jervis  and every living Soul of the Family and I will pray for you as long as I live And so I rose up and was  forc'd to lean upon my Master's Elbowchair or I should have sunk down  The poor old Man wept more than I and said Adsbobbers was ever the like heard 'Tis too much too much I can't bear it As I hope to live I am quite melted Dear Sir forgive her The poor Thing prays for you she prays for us all She owns her Fault yet  won't  be forgiven I profess I know not what to make of it  My Master himself harden'd Wretch as he was seem'd a little mov'd and took his Handkerchief out of his Pocket and walk'd to the Window What Sort of a Day is it said he And then getting a little more Hardheartedness he said Well you may be gone from my Presence thou strange Medley of Inconsistence but you shan't stay after your Time in the House  Nay pray Sir pray Sir said the good old Man relent a little Adsheartlikins you young Gentlemen are made of Iron and Steel I think I'm sure said he my Heart's turn'd into Butter and is running away at my Eyes I never felt the like before Said my Master with an imperious Tone Get out of my Presence Hussy I can't bear you in my Sight Sir said I I'm going as fast as I can  But indeed my dear Father and Mother my Head was so giddy and my Limbs trembled so that I was forc'd to go holding by the Wainscot all the way with both my Hands and thought I should not have got to the Door But when I did as I hop'd this would be my last Interview with this terrible hardhearted Master I turn'd about and made a low Curt'sy and said God bless you Sir God bless  you  Mr  Longman  And I went into the Lobby leading to the great Hall and dropt into the first Chair for I could get no further a good while  I leave all these Things to your Reflection my dear Parents but I can write no more My poor Heart's almost broken Indeed it is O when shall I get away Send me good God in Safety once more to my poor Father's peaceful Cot and there the worst that can happen will be Joy in Perfection to what I now bear O pity  Your distressed Daughter  LETTER XXVIII  My dear Father and Mother  I Must write on tho' I shall come so soon for now I have hardly any thing else to do For I have finish'd all that lay upon me to do and only wait the good Time of setting out Mrs  Jervis  said I must be low in Pocket for what I had laid out and so would have presented me with two Guineas of her Five but I could not take them of her because poor Gentlewoman she pays old Debts for her Children that were extravagant and wants them herself This tho' was very good in her  I am sorry I shall have but little to bring with me but I know you won't you are so good and I will work the harder when I come home if I can get a little Plainwork or any thing to do But all your Neighbourhood is so poor that I fear I shall want Work but maybe Dame  Mumford  can help me to something from some good Family she is acquainted with  Here what a sad Thing it is I have been brought up wrong as Matters stand For you know my good Lady now in Heav'n lov'd Singing and Dancing  and as she would have it I had a Voice she made me learn both and often and often has she made me sing her an innocent Song and a good Psalm too and dance before her And I must learn to flower and draw too and to work fine Work with my Needle why all this too I have got pretty tolerably at my Fingers End as they say and she us'd to praise me and was a good Judge of such Matters  Well now what is all this to the Purpose as Things have turn'd about  Why no more nor less than that I am like the Grashopper in the Fable which I have read of in my Lady's Books and I will write it down in the very Words  "As the Ants were airing their Provisions one Winter a hungry Grashopper as suppose it was poor I begg'd a Charity of them They told him That he should have wrought in Summer if he would not have wanted in Winter Well says the Grashopper but I was not idle neither for I sung out the whole Season Nay then said they you'll e'en do well to make a merry Year of it and dance in Winter to the Tune you sung in Summer"  So I shall make a fine Figure with my Singing and my Dancing when I come home to you Nay I doubt I shall even be unfit for a  Mayday  Holidaytime for these Minuits Rigadoons and  French  Dances that I have been practising will make me but ill Company for my rural Milkmaid Companions that are to be To be sure I had better as Things stand have learn'd to wash and scour and brew and bake and suchlike But I hope if I can't get Work and can get a Place to learn these soon if any body will  have the Goodness to bear with me till I can learn For I bless God I have an humble and a teachable Mind for all what my Master says and next to his Grace that is all my Comfort For I shall think nothing too mean that is honest It may be a little hard at first but wo to my proud Heart if I shall find it so on Trial for I will make it bend to its Condition or will break it  I have read of a good Bishop that was to be burnt for his Religion and he try'd how he could bear it by putting his Fingers into the lighted Candle So I t'other Day try'd when  Rachel  's Back was turn'd if I could not scour the Pewter Plate she had begun I see I could do't by Degrees tho' I blister'd my Hand in two Places  All the Matter is if I could get Needlework enough I would not spoil my Fingers by this rough Work But if I can't I hope to make my Hands as red as a Bloodpudden and as hard as a Beechen Trencher to accommodate them to my Condition But I must break off here's somebody coming  'Tis only our  Hannah  with a Message from Mrs  Jervis  But hold here is somebody else Well it is only  Rachel    I am as much frighted as were the City Mouse and the Country Mouse in the same Book of Fables at every thing that stirs Oh I have a Power of these Things to entertain you with in Winter Evenings when I come home If I can but get Work with a little Time for Reading I hope we shall be very happy over our Peat Fires  What made me hint to you that I should bring but little with me is this  You must know I did intend to do as I have this Afternoon And that is I took all my Cloaths  and all my Linen and I divided them into three Parcels as I had before told Mrs  Jervis  I intended to do and I said It is now  Monday  Mrs  Jervis  and I am to go away on  Thursday  Morning betimes so tho' I know you don't doubt my Honesty I beg you will look over my poor Matters and let every one have what belongs to them for said I you know I am resolv'd to take with me only what I can properly call my own  Said she I did not know her Drift then to be sure she meant well but I did not thank her for it when I did know it Let your Things be brought down into the Greenroom and I will do any thing you would have me do  With all my Heart said I Greenroom or anywhere but I think you might step up and see 'em as they lie  However I fetch'd 'em down and laid them in three Parcels as before and when I had done I went down to call her up to look at them  Now it seems she had prepared my Master for this Scene unknown to me and in this Greenroom was a Closet with a Sashdoor and a Curtain before it for there she puts her Sweetmeats and such Things and she did it it seems to turn his Heart as knowing what I intended I suppose that he should make me take the Things for if he had I should have made Money of them to help us when we got together for to be sure I could never have appear'd in them  Well as I was saying he had got unknown to me in this Closet I suppose while I went to call Mrs  Jervis  And she since told me it was at his Desire when she told him something of what I intended or else she would not have done it Tho' I have Reason I'm sure to remember the last Closetwork  So I said when she came up Here Mrs  Jervis  is the first Parcel I will spread it all abroad These are the Things my good Lady gave meIn the first place said Iand so I went on describing the Cloaths and Linen my Lady had given me mingling Blessings as I proceeded for her Goodness to me and when I had turn'd over that Parcel I said Well so much for the first Parcel Mrs  Jervis  that was my Lady's Gifts  Now I come to the Presents of my dear virtuous Master Hay you know  Closet  for that Mrs  Jervis  She laugh'd and said I never saw such a comical Girl in my Life But go on I will Mrs  Jervis  said I as soon as I have open'd the Bundle for I was as brisk and as pert as could be little thinking who heard me  Now here Mrs  Jervis  said I are my ever worthy Master's Presents and then I particulariz'd all those in the second Bundle  After which I turn'd to my own and said  Now Mrs  Jervis  comes poor  Pamela  's Bundle and a little one it is to the others First here is a Calico Nightgown that I used to wear o' Mornings 'Twill be rather too good for me when I get home but I must have something Then there is a quilted Calimanco Coat and a Pair of Stockens I bought of the Pedlar and my Strawhat with blue Strings and a Remnant of  Scots  Cloth which will make two Shirts and two Shifts the same I have on for my poor Father and Mother And here are four other Shifts one the Fellow to that I have on another pretty good one and the other two old fine ones that will serve me to turn and wind with at home for they are not worth leaving behind me and here are two Pair of Shoes I have taken the Lace off which I will burn and maybe will fetch me  some little Matter at a Pinch with an old silver Buckle or two  What do you laugh for Mrs  Jervis  said I Why you are like an  April  Day you cry and laugh in a Breath  Well let me seen ay here is a Cotton Handkerchief I bought of the Pedlar there should be another somewhere O here it is And here too are my newbought knit Mittens And this is my new Flannel Coat the Fellow to that I have on And in this Parcel pinn'd together are several Pieces of printed Calico Remnants of Silks and suchlike that if good Luck should happen and I should get Work would serve for Robings and Facings and suchlike Uses And here too are a Pair of Pockets they are too fine for me but I have no worse Bless me said I I did not think I had so many good Things  Well Mrs  Jervis  said I you have seen all my Store and I will now sit down and tell you a Piece of my Mind  Be brief then said she my good Girl for she was afraid she said afterwards that I should say too much  Why then the Case is this I am to enter upon a Point of Equity and Conscience Mrs  Jervis  and I must beg if you love me you'd let me have my own Way Those Things there of my Lady's I can have no Claim to so as to take them away for she gave them me supposing I was to wear them in her Service and to do Credit to her bountiful Heart But since I am to be turn'd away you know I cannot wear them at my poor Father's for I should bring all the little Village upon my Back and so I resolve not to have  them    Then Mrs  Jervis  said I I have far less Right to these of my worthy Master's For you see what was his Intention in giving them to me So they were to be the Price of my Shame and if I  could  make use of them I should think I should never prosper with them and besides you know Mrs  Jervis  if I would not do the good Gentleman's Work why should I take his Wages So in Conscience in Honour in every thing I have nothing to say to thee thou  second wicked  Bundle  But said I come to my Arms my dear  third  Parcel the Companion of my Poverty and the Witness of my Honesty and may I never deserve the least Rag that is contain'd in thee when I forfeit a Title to that Innocence that I hope will ever be the Pride of my Life and then I am sure it will be my highest Comfort at my Death when all the Riches and Pomps of the World will be worse than the vilest Rags that can be worn by Beggars And so I hugg'd my  third  Bundle  But said I Mrs  Jervis  and she wept to hear me one thing more I have to trouble you with and that's all  There are Four Guineas you know that came out of my good Lady's Pocket when she dy'd that with some Silver my Master gave me Now these same Four Guineas I sent to my poor Father and Mother and they have broken them but would make them up if I would And if you think it should be so it shall But pray tell me honestly your Mind As to the Three Years before my Lady's Death do you think as I had no Wages I may be suppos'd to be Quits By Quits I cannot mean that my poor Services should be equal to my Lady's Goodness for that's impossible But as all her Learning and Education of me as Matters have turn'd will be of little Service to me now for it had been better  for me to have been brought up to hard Labour to be sure for that I must turn to at last if I can't get a Place and you know in Places too one is subject to such Temptations as are dreadful to think of So I say by Quits I only mean as I return all the good Things she gave me whether I may not set my little Services against my Keeping because as I said my Learning is not now in the Question and I am sure my dear good Lady would have thought so had she liv'd But that too is now out of the Question Well then if so I would ask whether in above this Year that I have liv'd with my Master as I am resolved to leave all his Gifts behind me I may not have earn'd besides my Keeping these Four Guineas and these poor Cloaths here upon my Back and in my third Bundle Now tell me your Mind freely without Favour or Affection  Alas my dear Maiden said she you make me unable to speak to you at all To be sure it will be the highest Affront that can be offer'd for you to leave any of these Things behind you and you must take all your Bundles with you or my Master will never forgive you  Well well Mrs  Jervis  said I I don't care I have been too much used to be snubb'd and hardly treated by my Master of late I have done him no Harm and I shall always pray for him and wish him happy But I don't deserve these Things I know I don't Then I can't wear them if I should take them so they can be of no Use to me And I trust I shall not want the poor Pittance that is all I desire to keep Life and Soul together Bread and Water I can live upon Mrs  Jervis  with Content Water I shall get anywhere and if I can't get me Bread I will live like a Bird in Winter upon Hips and Haws  and at other times upon Pignuts and Potatoes or Turneps or any thing So what Occasion have I for these ThingsBut all I ask is about these Four Guineas and if you think I need not return them that is all I want to know To be sure my Dear you need not said she you have well earn'd them by that Waistcoat only No I think not  so  in that only but in the Linen▪ and other Things do you think I have Yes yes said she and more And my Keeping allow'd for I mean said I and these poor Cloaths on my Back besides Remember that Mrs  Jervis  Yes my dear Oddones no doubt you have Well then said I I am as happy as a Princess I am quite as rich as I wish to be And once more my dear third Bundle I will hug thee to my Bosom And I beg you'll say nothing of all this till I am gone that my Master mayn't be so angry but that I may go in Peace for my Heart without other Matters will be ready to break to part with you all  Now Mrs  Jervis  said I as to one Matter more And that is my Master's last Usage of me before Mr  Longman  Said she Pr'ythee dear  Pamela  step to my Chamber and fetch me a Paper I left on my Table I have something to shew you in it I will said I and stept down but that was only a Fetch to take the Orders of my Master I found It seems he said he thought two or three times to have burst out upon me but he could not stand it and wish'd I might not know he was there But I tript up again so nimbly for there was no Paper that I just saw his Back as if coming out of that Green Room and going into the next to it the first Door that was open I whipt in and shut the Door and bolted it O Mrs  Jervis  said I what have you done by me I see I can't confide in any body I am beset on all Hands Wretched wretched  Pamela  where shalt thou expect  a Friend if Mrs  Jervis  joins to betray me thus She made so many Protestations telling me all and that he own'd I had made him wipe his Eyes two or three times and said she hop'd it would have a good Effect and remember'd me that I had said nothing but would rather move Compassion than Resentment that I forgave her But O that I was safe from this House for never poor Creature sure was so fluster'd as I have been for so many Months together I am called down from this most tedious Scribble I wonder what will next befal  Your dutiful Daughter  Mrs  Jervis  says she is sure I shall have the Chariot to carry me home to you Tho' this will look too great for me yet it will shew as if I was not turn'd away quite in Disgrace The travelling Charriot is come from  Lincolnshire  and I fansy I shall go in that for the other is quite grand  LETTER XXIX  My dear Father and Mother  I Write again tho' maybe I shall bring it to you in my Pocket myself For I shall have no Writeing nor Writingtime I hope when I come to you This is  Wednesday  Morning and I shall I hope set out to you Tomorrow Morning but I have had more Trials and more Vexation but of another Complexion too a little though all from the same Quarter  Yesterday my Master after he came from Hunting sent for me I went with great Terror for I expected he would storm and be in a fine Passion with me for my Freedom of Speech before So I was resolv'd to begin first with Submission to disarm his Anger and I fell upon my Knees as soon as I saw him and I said Good Sir let me beseech you as you hope to be forgiven yourself and for the sake of my dear good Lady your Mother who recommended me to you with her last Words to forgive me all my Faults And only grant me this Favour the last I have to ask you that you will let me depart your House with Peace and Quietness of Mind that I may take such a Leave of my dear Fellowservants as befits me and that my Heart be not quite broken  He took me up in a kinder manner than ever I had known and he said Shut the Door  Pamela  and come to me in my Closet I want to have a little serious Talk with you How can I Sir said I how can I and wrung my Hands O pray Sir let me go out of your Presence I beseech you By the God that made me said he I'll do you no Harm Shut the Parlourdoor and come to me in my Library  He then went into his Closet which is his Library and full of rich Pictures besides a noble Apartment tho' called a Closet and next the private Garden into which it has a Door that opens I shut the Parlourdoor as he bid me but stood at it irresolute Place some Confidence in me surely said he you may when I have spoken thus solemnly So I crept towards him with trembling Feet and my Heart throbbing through my Handkerchief Come in said he when I bid you I did so Pray Sir said I pity and spare me I will said he as I hop'd to be sav'd He sat down upon a rich Settee and took  hold of my Hand and said Don't doubt me  Pamela  From this Moment I will no more consider you as my Servant and I desire you'll not use me with Ingratitude for the Kindness I am going to express towards you This a little embolden'd me and he said holding both my Hands in his You have too much Wit and good Sense not to discover that I in spite of my Heart and all the Pride of it cannot but love you Yes look up to me my sweetfac'd Girl I must say I love you and have put on a Behaviour to you that was much against my Heart in hopes to frighten you to my Purposes You see I own it ingenuously and don't play your Sex upon me for it  I was unable to speak and he seeing me too much oppress'd with Confusion to go on in that Strain said Well  Pamela  let me know in what Situation of Life is your Father I know he is a poor Man but is he as low and as honest as he was when my Mother took you  Then I could speak a little and with a down Look and I felt my Face glow like Fire I said Yes Sir as  poor  and as  honest  too and that is my Pride Says he I will do something for him if it be not your Fault and make all your Family happy Ah Sir said I he is happier already than ever he can be if his Daughter's Innocence is to be the Price of your Favour And I beg you will not speak to me on the  only  Side that can wound me I have no Design of that sort said he O Sir said I tell me not so tell me not so 'Tis easy said he for me to be the Making of your Father without injuring you Well Sir said I if this can be done let me know how and all I can do with Innocence shall be the Study and Practice of my LifeBut Oh what can such a poor Creature as I do and do my Duty Said he I would have you stay a Week or a Fortnight only and behave yourself  with Kindness to me I stoop to beg it of you and you shall see all shall turn out beyond your Expectation I see said he you are going to answer otherwise than I would have you and I begin to be vex'd I should thus meanly sue and so I will say that your Behaviour before honest  Longman  when I used you as I did and you could so well have vindicated yourself has quite charmed me And tho' I am not pleased with all you said Yesterday while I was in the Closer yet you have mov'd me more to admire you than before and I am awaken'd to see more Worthiness in you than ever I saw in any Lady in the World All the Servants from the highest to the lowest doat upon you instead of envying you and look upon you in so superior a Light as speaks what you ought to be I have seen more of your Letters than you imagine This surpris'd me and am quite overcome with your charming Manner of Writing so free so easy and many of your Sentiments so much above your Years and your Sex and all put together makes me as I tell you love you to Extravagance Now  Pamela  when I have stoop'd so low as to acknowledge all this oblige me only to stay another Week or Fortnight to give me time to bring about some certain Affairs and you shall see how much you shall find your Account in it  I trembled to find my poor Heart giving WayO good Sir said I spare a poor Maiden that cannot look up to you and speak My Heart is full And why should you wish to undo meOnly oblige me said he to stay a Fortnight longer and  John  shall carry Word to your Father that I will see him in the Time either here or at the  Swan  in his Village O Sir said I my Heart will burst but on my bended Knees I beg you to let me go Tomorrow as I design'd And don't offer to tempt a poor Creature  whose whole Will would be to do yours if my Virtue would permitIt shall permit it said he for I intend no Injury to you God is my WitnessImpossible said I I cannot Sir believe you after what has passed How many Ways are there to undo poor Creatures Good God protect me this  one  Time and send me but to my dear Father's Cot in Safety Strange damn'd Fate says he that when I speak so solemnly I can't be believ'dWhat  should  I believe Sir said I what  can  I believe What have you said but that I am to stay a Fortnight longer and what then is to become of me My Pride of Birth and Fortune damn them both said he since they cannot obtain Credit with you but must add to your Suspicions will not let me stoop at once and I ask you but a Fortnight's Stay that after this Declaration I may pacify those proud Demands upon me  O how my Heart throbb'd and I began for I did not know what I did to say the Lord's Prayer None of your Beads to me  Pamela  said he thou art a perfect Nun I think  But I said aloud with my Eyes lifted up to Heaven  Lead me not into Temptation But deliver me from Evil  O my good God He hugg'd me in his Arms and said Well my dear Girl then you stay this Fortnight and you shall see what I will do for youI'll leave you a Moment and walk into the next Room to give you time to think of it and to shew you I have no Design upon you Well this I thought did not look amiss  He went out and I was tortur'd with twenty different Thoughts in a Minute sometimes I thought that to stay a Week or Fortnight longer in this House to obey him while Mrs  Jervis  was with me could do no great Harm But then thought I how  do I know what I may be  able  to do I have withstood his  Anger  but may I not relent at his  Kindness  How shall I stand  that  Well I hope thought I by the same protecting Grace in which I will always confideBut then what has he promised Why he will make my poor Father and Mother's Life comfortable O said I to myself that is a rich Thought but let me not dwell upon it for fear I should indulge it to my RuinWhat can he do for  me  poor Girl as I amWhat can his Greatness stoop to He talks thought I of his Pride of Heart and Pride of Condition O these are in his  Head  and in his  Heart  too or he would not confess them to me at  such  an Instant Well then thought I this can be only to seduce me He has promised nothing But I am to  see  what he will do if I stay a Fortnight and this Fortnight thought I again is no such great Matter and I shall see in a few Days how he carries it But then when I again reflected upon the Distance between him and me and his now open Declaration of Love as he called it and that after this he would talk with me on that Subject  more plainly  than ever and I should be  less  arm'd maybe to withstand him and then I bethought myself why if he meant no Dishonour he should not speak before Mrs  Jervis  and the odious frightful Closet came again into my Head and my narrow Escape upon it and how easy it might be for him to send Mrs  Jervis  and the Maids out of the way and so that all the Mischief he design'd me might be brought about in less than that Time I resolv'd to go away and trust all to Providence and nothing to myself And how ought I to be thankful for this Resolution as you shall hear  But just as I have writ to this Place  John  sends me Word that he is going this Minute your Way  and so I will send so far as I have written and hope by tomorrow Night to ask your Blessings at your own poor but happy Abode and tell you the rest by Word of Mouth and so I rest 'till then and for ever  Your dutiful Daughter  LETTER XXX  My dear Father and Mother  I Will continue my Writing still because maybe I shall like to read it when I am with you to see what Dangers I have been enabled to escape and tho' I bring it along with me  I told you my Resolution my happy Resolution as I have Reason to think it And just then he came in again with great Kindness in his Looks and said I make no Doubt  Pamela  you will stay this Fortnight to oblige me I knew not how to frame my Words so as to deny and yet not make him storm But said I Forgive Sir your poor distressed Maiden I know I cannot possibly deserve any Favour at your Hands consistent with Virtue and I beg you will let me go to my poor Father Why said he thou art the veriest Fool that I ever knew I tell you I will  see  your Father I'll send for him hither tomorrow in my travelling Chariot if you will and I'll let him know what I intend to do for  him  and  you  What Sir may I ask you can that be Your Honour's noble Estate may easily make  him  happy and not unuseful perhaps to  you  in some respect or other But what Price am I to pay for all thisYou shall be happy as you can wish said he I do assure you And here I will now give you this Purse in which  are Fifty Guineas which I will allow your Father yearly and find an Employ suitable to his Liking to deserve  that  and  more Pamela  he shall never want depend upon it I would have given you still more for him but that perhaps you'd suspect I intended it as a Design upon youO Sir said I take back your Guineas I will not touch one nor will my Father I am sure till he knows what is to be done  for  them and particularly what is to become of  me  Why then  Pamela  said he suppose I find a Man of Probity and genteel Calling for a Husband for you that shall make you a Gentlewoman as long as you live  I  want no Husband Sir said I for now I began to see him in all his black ColoursBut being in his Power so I thought I would a little dissemble But said he you are so pretty that go where you will you'll never be free from the Designs of some or other of our Sex and I shall think I don't answer the Care of my dying Mother for you who committed you to me if I don't provide you a Husband to protect your Virtue and your Innocence and a worthy one I have thought of for you  O black perfidious Creature thought I what an Implement art thou in the Hands of  Lucifer  to ruin the innocent HeartBut still I dissembled for I fear'd much both him and the Place I was in But whom pray Sir have you thought ofWhy said be young Mr  Williams  my Chaplain in  Lincolnshire  who will make you happy Does he know Sir said I any thing of your Honour's Intentions No my Girl said he and kissed me much against my Will for his very Breath was now Poison to me but his Dependence upon my Favour and your Beauty and Merit will make him rejoice at my Kindness to him Well Sir said I then it is time enough to consider of this Matter and this  cannot hinder me from going to my Father's For what will staying a Fortnight longer signify to this Your Honour's Care and Goodness may extend to me  there  as well as  here  and Mr  Williams  and all the World shall know that I am not ashamed of my Father's Poverty  He would kiss me again and I said if I am to think of Mr  Williams  or any body I beg  you'll  not be so free with me That is not pretty I'm sure Well said he but you stay this next Fortnight and in that time I'll have both  Williams  and your Father here for I will have the Match concluded in my House and when I have brought it on you shall settle it as you please together Mean time take and send only these Fifty Pieces to your Father as an Earnest of my Favour and I'll make you all happySir said I I beg at least two Hours to consider of this I shall said he be gone out in one Hour and I would have you write to your Father what I propose and  John  shall carry it on purpose and he shall take the Purse with him for the good old Man if you approve it Sir said I I will then let you know in one Hour my Resolution Do so said he and gave me another Kiss and let me go  O how I rejoiced I had got out of his Clutches So I write you this that you may see how Matters stand for I am resolved to come away if possible Base wicked treacherous Gentleman as he is  So here was a Trap laid for your poor  Pamela  I tremble to think of it O what a Scene of Wickedness was here laid down for all my wretched Life Blackhearted Wretch how I hate himFor at first as you'll see by what I have written he would have made me believe other Things and this of Mr  Williams  I believe came into his Head after he walked out from his Closet as I suppose to give himself time  to think how to delude me better But the Covering was now too thin and easy to be seen through  I went to my Chamber and the first thing I did was to write to him for I thought it was best not to see him again if I could help it and I put it under his Parlourdoor after I had copy'd it as follows  'Honour'd Sir  'YOUR last Proposal to me convinces me that I ought not to stay but to go to my Father if it were but to ask his Advice about Mr  Williams  And I am so set upon it that I am not to be persuaded So honour'd Sir with a thousand Thanks for all Favours I will set out tomorrow early and the Honour you design'd me as Mrs  Jervis  tells me of your Chariot there will be no Occasion for because I can hire I believe Farmer  Brady  's Chaise So begging you will not take it amiss I shall ever be  'Your dutiful Servant  'As to the Purse Sir my poor Father to be sure won't forgive me if I take it 'till he can know how to deserve it Which is impossible'  So he has just now sent Mrs  Jervis  to tell me That since I am resolv'd to go go I may and the travelling Chariot shall be ready but it shall be worse for me for that he will never trouble himself about me as long as he lives Well so I get out of the House I care not only I should have been glad I could with innocence have made you my dear Parents happy  I cannot imagine the Reason of it but  John  who I thought was gone with my last is but now going and he sends to know if I have any thing else to  carry So I break off to send you this with the former  I am now preparing for my Journey and about taking Leave of my good Fellowservants And if I have not time to write I must tell you the rest when I am so happy as to be with you  One Word more I slip in a Paper of Verses on my going sad poor Stuff but as they come from me you'll not dislike them maybe I shew'd them to Mrs  Jewkes  and she lik'd them and took a Copy and made me sing them to her and in the Green Room too but I look'd into the Closet first I will only add that I am  Your dutiful Daughter  Let me just say That he has this Moment sent me Five Guineas by Mrs  Jervis  as a Present for my Pocket So I shall be very rich for as  she  brought them I thought I might take them He says he won't see me And I may go when I will in the Morning And  Lincolnshire Robin  shall drive me but he is so angry he orders that nobody shall go out at the Door with me not so much as into the Coachyard Well I can't help it not I▪ but does not this expose himself more than me  But  John  waits and I would have brought this and the other myself but he says he has put it up among other things and so can take both as well as one  John  is very good and very honest I am under great Obligations to him I'd give him a Guinea now I'm so rich if I thought he'd take it I hear nothing of my Lady's Cloaths and those my Master gave me For I told Mrs  Jervis  I would not take them but I fansy by a Word or two that was dropt they will be sent after me Dear Sirs what a  rich  Pamela  you'll have if they should But as I can't wear them if they do I don't desire them and if I have them will turn them into Money as I can have Opportunity Well no more I'm in a fearful Hurry  VERSES  on my going away  I  MY Fellowservants dear attend  To these few Lines which I have penn'd  I'm sure they're from your honest Friend  And Wisherwell poor  Pamela    II  I from a State of low Degree  Was taken by our good Lady  Some say it better had been for me  I'd still been rustick  Pamela    III  But yet my Friends I hope not so  For tho' I to my Station low  Again return I joyful go  And think no Shame to  Pamela    IV  For what makes out true Happiness  But Innocence and inward Peace  And that thank God I do possess  O happy happy  Pamela  V  My future Lot I cannot know  But this I'm sure wheree'er I go  Whate'er I am whate'er I do  I'll be the grateful  Pamela    VI  No sad Regrets my Heart annoy  I'll pray for all your Peace and Joy  From Master high to Scullion Boy  For all your Loves to  Pamela  VII  One thing or two I've more to say  God's holy Will be sure obey  And for our Master always pray  As ever shall poor  Pamela    VIII  For Oh we pity should the Great  Instead of  envying  their Estate  Temptations always on 'em wait  Exempt from which are such as we  IX  Their Riches often are a Snare  At best a pamper'd weighty Care  Their Servants far more happy are  At least so thinketh  Pamela    X  Your Parents and Relations love  Let them your Duty ever prove  And you'll be blessed from above  As will I hope poor  Pamela    XI  For if ashamed I should be  Of my dear Parents low Degree  I'm sure it would been worse for me  God had not blessed  Pamela    XII  Thrice happy may you ever be  Each one in his and her Degree  And Sirs whene'er you think of me  Pray for Content to  Pamela    XIII  Yes pray for my Content and Peace  For rest assur'd I'll never cease  To pray for all your Joys Increase  While Life is lent to  Pamela    XIV  On God all future Good depends  Him let us serve My Sonnet ends  With Thankye thankye honest Friends  For all your Loves to  Pamela    HERE it is necessary to observe that the fair  Pamela  's Trials were not yet over but the worst of all were to come at a Time when she thought them at an End and that she was returning to her Father For when her Master found her Virtue was not to be subdu'd and he had in vain try'd to conquer his Passion for her being a Gentleman of Pleasure and Intrigue he had order'd his  Lincolnshire  Coachman to bring his travelling Chariot from thence not caring to trust his Body Coachman who with the rest of the Servants so greatly lov'd and honour'd the fair Damsel and having given him Instructions accordingly and prohibited his other Servants on Pretence of resenting  Pamela  's Behaviour from accompanying her any Part of the Way he drove her Five Miles on the Way to her Father's and then turning off cross'd the Country and carry'd her onward towards his  Lincolnshire  Estate  It is also to be observ'd that the Messenger of her Letters to her Father who so often pretended Business that way was an Implement in his Master's Hands and employ'd by him for that Purpose and who always gave her Letters first to him and his Master used to open and read them and then send them on by which means as he hints to her as she observes in one of her Letters  p  he was no Stranger to what she wrote Thus every way was the poor Virgin beset And the Whole will shew the base Arts of designing Men to gain their wicked Ends and how much it behoves the Fair Sex to stand upon their Guard against their artful Contrivances especially when Riches and Power conspire against Innocence and a low Estate  A few Words more will be necessary to make the Sequel better understood The intriguing Gentleman thought fit however to keep back from her Father her Three last Letters in which she mentions his concealing himself to hear her partitioning out her Cloaths his last Effort to induce her to stay a Fortnight his pretended Proposal of the Chaplain and her Hopes of speedily seeing them as also her Verses and to send himself a Letter to her Father which is as follows  'Goodman  ANDREWS  'YOU will wonder to receive a Letter from me But I think I am obliged to let you know that I have discover'd the strange Correspondence carry'd on between you and your Daughter so injurious to my Honour and Reputation and which I think you should not have encourag'd till you knew there were sufficient Grounds for these Aspersions which she so plentifuly casts upon  me Something possibly there might be in what she has written from time to time but believe me with all her pretended Simplicity and Innocence I never knew so much romantick Invention as she is Mistress of In short the Girl's Head's turn'd by Romances and such idle Stuff to which she has given herself up ever since her kind Lady's Death And she assumes such Airs as if she was a Mirror of Perfection and believed every body had a Design upon her  'Don't mistake me however I believe her very honest and very virtuous▪ but I have found out also that she is carrying on a sort of Correspondence or Love Affair with a young Clergyman that I hope in time to provide for but who at present is destitute of any Subsistence but my Favour And what would be the Consequence can you think of two young Folks who have nothing in the World to trust to of their own to come together with a Family multiplying upon them before they have Bread to eat  'For my Part I have too much Kindness to them both not to endeavour to prevent it if I can And for this Reason I have sent her out of his Way for a little while till I can bring them to better Consideration and I would not therefore have you be surpris'd you don't see your Daughter so soon as you might possibly expect  'Yet I do assure you upon my Honour that she shall be safe and inviolate and I hope you don't doubt me notwithstanding any Airs she may have given herself upon my jocular Pleasantry to her and perhaps a little innocent Romping with her so usual with young Folks of the two Sexes when they have been long acquainted and grown up together for Pride is not my Talent  'As she is a mighty Letterwriter I hope she has had the Duty to apprize you of her Intrigue with the young Clergyman and I know not whether it meets with your Countenance But now she is absent for a little while for I know he would have follow'd her to your Village if she had gone home and there perhaps they would have ruin'd one another by marrying I doubt not I shall bring him to see his Interest and that he engages not before he knows how to provide for a Wife And when that can be done let them come together in God's Name for me  'I expect not to be answered on this Head but by your good Opinion and the Confidence you may repose in my Honour being  'Your hearty Friend to serve you  '  P S  I find my Man  John  has been the Manager of the Correspondence in which such Liberties have been taken with me I shall soon let the saucy Fellow know how much I resent his Part of the Affair in a manner that becomes me It is a hard thing that a Man of my Character in the World should be used thus freely by his own Servants'  It is easy to guess at the poor old Man's Concern upon reading this Letter from a Gentleman of so much Consideration He knew not what Course to take and had no manner of Doubt of his poor Daughter's Innocence and that foul Play was design'd her Yet he sometimes hoped the best and was ready to believe the surmised Correspondence between the Clergyman and her having not receiv'd the Letters she wrote which would have clear'd up that Affair  But after all he resolved as well to quiet his own as his Wife's Uneasiness to undertake a Journey to the 'Squire's and leaving his poor Wife to excuse him to the Farmer who employ'd him he set out that very Evening late as it was and travelling all Night found himself soon after Daylight at the Gate of the Gentleman before the Family was up And there he sat down to rest himself till he should see somebody stirring  The Grooms were the first he saw coming out to water their Horses and he ask'd in so distressful a manner what was become of  Pamela  that they thought him crasy and said Why what have you to do with  Pamela  old Fellow Get out of the Horse's WayWhere is your Master said the poor Man pray Gentlemen don't be angry My Heart's almost brokeHe never gives any thing at the Door I assure you says one of the Grooms so you'll lose your LabourI am not a Beggar  yet  said the poor old Man I want nothing of him but my  Pamela  O my Child my Child  I'll be hang'd says one of them if this is not Mrs  Pamela  's FatherIndeed indeed said he wringing his Hands I am and weeping Where is my Child Where is my  Pamela  Why Father said one of them we beg your Pardon but she is gone home to you How long have you been come from home O but last Night said he I have travelled all Night Is the 'Squire at home or is he not Yes but he is not stirring tho' said the Grooms as yet Thank God for that said he thank God for that Then I hope I may be permitted to speak to him anon They asked him to go in and he stept into the Stable and sat down on the Stairs there wiping his Eyes and sighing so sadly that it grieved the Servants to hear him  The Family was soon raised with the Report of  Pamela  's Father coming to inquire after his Daughter and the Maids would fain have had him go into the Kitchen But Mrs  Jervis  having been told of his coming arose and hasten'd down to her Parlour and took him in with her and there heard all his sad Story and read the Letter She wept bitterly but yet endeavour'd before him to hide her Concern and said Well Goodman  Andrews  I cannot help weeping at your Grief but I hope there is no Occasion let nobody see this Letter whatever you do I dare say your Daughter's safe  Well but said he I see you Madam know nothing about herIf all was right so good a Gentlewoman as you are would not have been a Stranger to this To be sure you thought she was with me  Said she My Master does not always inform his Servants of his Proceedings but you need not doubt his Honour You have his Hand for it And you may see he can have no Design upon her because he is not from hence and does not talk of going hence O that is all I have to hope for said he that is all indeed But said heand was going on when the Report of his coming had reach'd the 'Squire who came down in his Morninggown and Slippers into the Parlour where he and Mrs  Jervis  were  What's the Matter Goodman  Andrews  said he what's the Matter O my Child said the good old Man give me my Child I beseech you Sir Why I thought says the 'Squire that I had satisfied you about her sure you have not a Letter I sent you written with my own Hand Yes yes but I have Sir said he and that brought me hither and I have walked all Night Poor Man return'd he with great seeming Compassion I am sorry for it truly Why your Daughter has made a strange Racket  in my Family and if I thought it would have disturbed you so much I would have e'en let her gone home but what I did was to serve  her  and  you  too She is very safe I do assure you Goodman  Andrews  And you may take my Honour for it I would not injure her for the World Do you think I would Mrs  Jervis  No I hope not Sir said she  Hope not  said the poor Man so do I but pray Sir give me my Child that is all I desire and I'll take care no Clergyman shall come near her  Why  London  is a great way off said the 'Squire and I can't send for her back presently What then said he have you sent my poor  Pamela  to  London  I would not have it said so says the 'Squire but I assure you upon my Honour she is quite safe and satisfied and will quickly inform you of as much by Letter I am sure she is in a reputable Family no less than a Bishop's and will wait on his Lady till I get this Matter over that I mentioned to you  O how shall I know this reply'd he What said the 'Squire pretending Anger am I to be doubted Do you believe I can have any View upon your Daughter And if I had do you think I would take such Methods as these to effect it Why Man you know not whom you talk to O Sir said he I beg your Pardon but consider my dear Child is in the Case Let me know what Bishop and where and I will travel to  London  barefoot to see my Daughter and then shall be satisfied  Why Goodman  Andrews  I think thou hast read Romances as well as thy Daughter and thy Head's turn'd with them May I not have my Word taken Do you think once more I would offer any thing to your Daughter Is there any thing looks like it Pr'ythee Man consider a little who I am and if I am not to be believ'd what signifies talking  Why Sir said he pray forgive me but there is no Harm to say What Bishop's or whereabouts What and so you'd go troubling his Lordship with your impertinent Fears and Stories Will you be satisfied if you have a Letter from her within a Week it may be less if she be not negligent to assure you all is well with her Why that said the poor Man will be a Comfort Well then said the Gentleman I can't answer for her Negligence if she don't but she will send a Letter to you Mrs  Jervis  for I desire not to see it I have had Trouble enough about her already and be sure you send it by a Man and Horse the Moment you receive it To be sure I will said she Thank your Honour said the good Man And then I must wait with as much Patience as I can for a Week which will be a Year to me  I tell you said the Gentleman it must be her own Fault if she don't for 'tis what I insisted upon for my own Reputation and I shan't stir from this House I assure you till she is heard from and that to Satisfaction God bless your Honour said the poor Man as you say and mean Truth  Amen Amen  Goodman  Andrews  said he you see I am not afraid to say  Amen  So Mrs  Jervis  make the good Man as welcome as you can and let me have no Uproar about the Matter  He then whispering her bid her give him a couple of Guineas to bear his Charges home telling him he should be welcome to stay there till the Letter came if he would and he should be a Witness that he intended honourably and not to stir from his House for one while  The poor old Man staid and din'd with Mrs  Jervis  with some tolerable Ease of Mind in hopes to hear from his beloved Daughter in a few Days and then accepting the Present return'd for his own House and resolv'd to be as patient as possible for a few Days  Mean time Mrs  Jervis  and all the Family were in the utmost Grief for the Trick put upon the poor  Pamela  and she and the Steward represented it to their Master in as moving Terms as they durst But were forc'd to rest satisfy'd with his general Assurances of intending her no Harm which however Mrs  Jervis  little believ'd from the Pretence he had made in his Letter of the Correspondence between  Pamela  and the young Parson which she knew to be all Invention tho' she durst not say so  But the Week after she went away they were made a little more easy by the following Letter brought by an unknown Hand and left for Mrs  Jervis  which how procur'd will be shewn in the Sequel  '  Dear Mrs Jervis  'I Have  been vilely trick'd and  instead of being driven by  Robin  to my dear Father's  I am  carry'd off to where I have no Liberty to tell However I am at present not used hardly  in the main  and I write to beg of you to let my dear Father and Mother whose Hearts must be wellnigh broken know That I am well and that I am and by the Grace of God ever will be their dutiful and honest Daughter as well as  '  Your obliged Friend  'PAMELA ANDREWS  '  I must neither send Date nor Place But have most solemn Assurances of honourable Usage  This is the only Time my low Estate has been troublesome to me since it has subjected me to the Frights I have undergone Love to your good Self and all my dear Fellowservants Adieu Adieu But pray for poor  PAMELA  '  This tho' it quieted not intirely their Apprehensions was shewn to the whole Family and to the Gentleman himself who pretended not to know how it came and Mrs  Jervis  sent it away to the good old Folks who at first suspected it was forged and not their Daughter's Hand but finding the contrary they were a little easier to hear she was alive and well And having inquir'd of all their Acquaintance what could be done and no one being able to put them in a Way how to proceed with Effect on so extraordinary an Occasion against so rich and daring a Gentleman and being afraid to make Matters worse tho' they saw plainly enough that by this Letter she was in no Bishop's Family and so mistrusted all the rest of his Story they apply'd themselves to Prayers for their poor Daughter and for a happy Issue to an Affair that almost distracted them  We shall now leave the honest old Pair praying for their dear  Pamela  and return to the Account she herself gives of all this having written it Journalwise to amuse and employ her Time in hopes some Opportunity might offer to send is to her Friends and as was her constant View that she might afterwards thankfully look back upon the Dangers she had escaped when they should be happily overblown as in Time she hoped they would be and that then she might examine and either approve of or repent for her own Conduct in them  LETTER XXXI  O my dearest Father and Mother  LET me write and bewail my miserable hard Fate tho' I have no Hope that what I write will be convey'd to your Hands I have now nothing  to do but write and weep and fearand pray But yet what can I hope for when I seem to be devoted as a Victim to the Will of a wicked Violator of all the Laws of God and ManBut gracious Heaven forgive me my Rashness and Despondency O let me not sin against thee for thou best knowest what is fittest for thy poor HandmaidAnd as thou sufferest not thy poor Creatures to be tempted above what they can bear I will resign to thy good Pleasure And still I hope desperate as my Condition seems that as those Trials are not of my own seeking nor the Effects of ray Presumption and Vanity I shall be enabled to overcome them and in God's own good Time be delivered from them  Thus do I pray imperfectly as I am forced by my distracting Fears and Apprehensions and O join with me my dear ParentsBut alas how can you know how can I reveal to you the dreadful Situation of your poor Daughter The unhappy  Pamela  may be undone which God forbid and sooner deprive me of Life I before you can know my hard Lot  O the unparallel'd Wickedness Stratagems and Devices of those who call themselves Gentlemen and pervert the Design of Providence in giving them ample Means to do Good to their own Perdition and to the Ruin of poor oppressed Innocence  But let me tell you what has befallen me and yet how shall you receive it For I have now no honest  John  to carry my Letters to you but am likely to be watch'd in all my Steps till my hard Fate ripens his wicked Projects for my Ruin I will every Day now write my sad State and some way perhaps may be open'd to send the melancholy Scribble to you But if you  know  it what will it do but aggravate your Troubles For O what can the  abject Poor do against the mighty Rich when they are determined to oppress  Well but I will proceed to write what I had hoped to tell you in a few Hours that I believed I should receive your grateful Blessings on my Return to you from so many Hardships  I will begin here with my Account from the last Letter I wrote you in which I inclosed my poor Stuff of Verses and continue it at times as I have Opportunity tho' as I said I know not how it can reach you now  The long hop'dfor  Thursday  Morning came that I was to set out I had taken my Leave of my Fellowservants overnight and a mournful Leave it was to us all For Men as well as Womenservants wept much to part with me and for  my  Part I was overwhelm'd with Tears and the affecting Instances of their Esteem They all would have made me little Presents as Tokens of their Love but I would not take any thing from the lower Servants to be sure But Mr  Longman  made me a Present of several Yards of  Holland  and a Silver Snuffbox and a Gold Ring which he desir'd me to keep for his sake and he wept over me but said I am sure so good a Maiden God will bless and tho' you return to your poor Father again and his low Estate yet Providence will find you out and  one  Day tho' I mayn't live to see it you  will  be rewarded  I said O dear Mr  Longman  you make me too rich and too mody and yet I must be a Beggar before my Time For I shall want often to be scribbling little thinking it would be my only Employment so soon and I will beg you Sir to favour me with some Paper and as soon as I get home I will write you a Letter to thank you for all your Kindness to me and a Letter to good Mrs  Jervis  too  This was lucky for I should have had none else but at Pleasure of my roughnatur'd Governess as I may call her but now I can write to ease my Mind tho' I can't send it to you and write what I please for she knows not how well I am provided For good Mr  Longman  gave me above forty Sheets of Paper and a dozen Pens and a little Phial of Ink which last I wrapt in Paper and put in my Pocket and some Wax and Wafers  O dear Sir said I you have set me up How shall I requite you He said By a Kiss my fair Mistress and I gave it very willingly for he is a good old Man  Rachel  and  Hannah  cry'd sadly when I took my Leave and  Jane  who sometimes used to be a little crossish and  Cicely  too wept sadly and said they would pray for me but poor  Jane  I doubt seldom says her Prayers for herself More's the Pity  Then  Arthur  the Gardener our  Robin  the Coachman and  Lincolnshire Robin  too who was to carry me were very civil and both had Tears in their Eyes which I thought then very goodnatur'd in  Lincolnshire Robin  because he knew but little of me But since I find he might well be concern'd for he had then his Instructions it seems and knew how he was to be a Means to entrap me  Then our other three Footmen  Harry Isaac  and  Benjamin  and Grooms and Helpers were very much affected likewise and the poor little Scullionboy  Tommy  was ready to run over for Grief  They had got all together overnight expecting to be differently employ'd in the Morning and they all begg'd to shake Hands with me and I kiss'd the Maidens and pray'd to God to bless them all and thanked them for all their Love and Kindnesses to  me And indeed I was forced to leave them sooner than I would because I could not stand it Indeed I could not  Harry  I could not have thought it for he is a little wildish they say cry'd till he sobb'd again  John  poor honed  John  was not then come back from you But as for the Butler Mr  Jonathan  he could not stay in Company  I thought to have told you a deal about this but I have worse things to employ my Thoughts  Mrs  Jervis  good Mrs  Jervis  cry'd all Night long and I comforted her all I could and she made me promise that if my Master went to  London  to attend Parliament or to  Lincolnshire  I would come and stay a Week with her And she would have given me Money but I would not take it  Well next Morning came and I wonder'd I saw nothing of poor honest  John  for I waited to take Leave of him and thank him for all his Civilities to me and to you But I suppose he was sent further by my Master and so could not return and I desired to be remember'd to him  And when Mrs  Jervis  told me with a sad Heart the Chariot was ready with four Horses to it I was just upon sinking into the Ground tho' I wanted to be with you  My Master was above Stairs and never asked to see me I was glad of it in the main but he knew false Heart as he is that I was not to be out of his ReachO preserve me Heaven from his Power and from his Wickedness  Well they were not suffer'd to go with me one Step as I writ to you before for he stood at the Window to see me go And in the Passage to the Gate out of his Sight there they stood all of them in two Rows and we could say nothing on both Sides but  God bless you and God bless you But  Harry  carried my own Bundle my third Bundle as I was used to call it to the Coach and some Plumcakes and Dietbread made for me overnight and some Sweatmeats and six Bottles of  Canary  Wine which Mrs  Jervis  would make me take in a Basket to chear our Hearts nowandthen when we got together as she said And I kissed all the Maids again and shook Hands with the Men again but Mr  Jonathan  and Mr  Longman  were not there and then I tript down Steps to the Chariot Mrs  Jervis  crying most sadly  I look'd up when I got to the Chariot and I saw my Master at the Window in his Gown and I curt'sy'd three times to him very low and pray'd for him with my Hands lifted up for I could not speak indeed I was not able And he bow'd his Head to me which made me then very glad he would take such Notice of me and in I stept and was ready to burst with Grief and could only till  Robin  began to drive wave my white Handkerchief to them wet with my Tears And at last away he drove  Jehulike  as they say out of the Courtyard And I too soon found I had Cause for greater and deeper Grief  Well said I to myself at this rate I shall soon be with my dear Father and Mother and till I had got as I supposed halfway I thought of the good Friends I had left And when on stopping for a little Bait to the Horses  Robin  told me I was near halfway I thought it was high time to wipe my Eyes and think to whom I was going as then alack for me I thought So I began to ponder what a Meeting I should have with you how glad you'd both be to see me come safe and innocent to you after all my Dangers and so I began to comfort myself and to banish the other gloomy Side from my Mind tho' too it return'd nowandthen for  I should be ingrateful not to love them for their Love  Well I believe I set out about Eight o'Clock in the Morning and I wonder'd and wonder'd when it was about Two as I saw by a Churchdial in a little Village we pass'd thro' that I was still more and more out of my Knowledge Heyday thought I to drive this strange Pace and to be so long agoing little more than twenty Miles is very odd But to be sure thought I  Robin  knows the Way  At last he stopt and look'd about him as if he was at a Loss for the Way and I said Mr  Robert  sure you are out of the WayI'm afraid I am said he But it can't be much I'll ask the first Person I see Pray do said I and he gave his Horses a Mouthful of Hay and I gave him some Cake and two Glasses of  Canary  Wine and stopt about half an Hour in all Then he drove on very fast again  I had so much to think of of the Dangers I now doubted not I had escaped of the loving Friends I had left and my best Friends I was going to and the many things I had to relate to you that I the less thought of the Way till I was startled out of my Meditations by the Sun beginning to set and still the Man driving on and his Horses sweating and foaming and then I began to be alarm'd all at once and call'd to him and he said he had horrid ill Luck for he had come several Miles out of the Way but was now right and should get in still before it was quite dark My Heart began then to misgive me a little and I was very much fatigued for I had no Sleep for several Nights before to signify and at last I said Pray Mr  Robert  there is a Town before us what do you call it If we are so much out of the Way we had better put up there for the Night comes on apace And Lord protect me thought I I shall  have new Dangers mayhap to encounter with the  Man  who have escaped the  Master  little thinking of the base Contrivance of the latter Says he I am just there 'tis but a Mile on one Side of the Town before us Nay said I I may be mistaken for it is a good while since I was this Way but I am sure the Face of the Country here is nothing like what I remember it  He pretended to be much out of Humour with himself for mistaking the Way and at last stopt at a Farmhouse about two Miles beyond the Village I had seen and it was then almost dark and he alighted and said We must make shift here for I am quite out  Lord thought I be good to the poor  Pamela  More Trials stillWhat will befal me next  The Farmer's Wife and Maid and Daughter came out and the Wife said What brings you this Way at this time of Night Mr  Robert  And with a Lady tooThen I began to be frighten'd out of my Wits and laying Middle and both Ends together I fell a crying and said God give me Patience I am undone for certain I Pray Mistress said I do you know Esquire  B  of  Bedfordshire  The wicked Coachman would have prevented the answering me but the simple Daughter said Know his Worship yes surely why he is my Father's LandlordWell said I then I am undone undone for everO wicked Wretch what have I done to you said I to the Coachman to serve me thus Vile Tool of a wicked Master Faith said the Fellow I'm sorry this Task was put upon me But I could not help it But make the best of it now here are very civil reputable Folks and you'll be safe here I'll assure youLet me get out said I and I'll walk back to the Town we came through late as it isFor I will not enter here  Said the Farmer's Wife You'll be very well used here I'll assure you young Gentlewoman and have better Conveniencies than anywhere in the Village I matter not Conveniencies said I I am betray'd and undone As you have a Daughter of your  own  pity me and let me know if your Landlord as you call him be here No I'll assure you he is not said she  And then came the Farmer a goodlike sort of Man grave and wellbehav'd and he spoke to me in such sort as made me a little pacify'd and seeing no Help for it I went in and the Wife immediately conducted me up Stairs to the best Apartment and told me that was mine as long as I staid and nobody should come near me but when I call'd I threw myself on the Bed in the Room tir'd and frighten'd to Death almost and gave way to the most excessive Fit of Grief that I ever had  The Daughter came up and said Mr  Robert  had given her a Letter to give me and  there  it was I raised myself and saw it was the Hand and Seal of the wicked Wretch my Master directed To Mrs  Pamela Andrews  This was a little better than to have him here tho' if he had he must have been brought thro' the Air for I thought  I  was  The good Woman for I began to see Things about a little reputable and no Guile appearing in them but rather a Face of Grief for my Grief offered me a Glass of some cordial Water which I accepted for I was ready to sink and then I sat up in a Chair a little tho' very faintish And they brought me two Candles and lighted a Brushwood Fire and said If I call'd I should be waited upon instantly and so left me to ruminate on my sad Condition and to read my Letter which I was not able to do presently After I had a little come to myself I found it to contain these Words  '  Dear  PAMELA  'THE Passion I have for you and your Obstinacy have constrain'd me to act by you in a manner that I know will occasion you great Trouble and Fatigue both of Mind and Body Yet forgive me my dear Girl for though I have taken this Step I will by all that's good and holy use you honourably Suffer not your Fears to transport you to a Behaviour that will be disreputable to us both For the Place where you'll receive this is a Farm that belongs to me and the People civil honest and obliging  'You will by this time be far on your way to the Place I have allotted for your Abode for a few Weeks till I have manag'd some Affairs that will make me shew myself to you in a much different Light than you may possibly apprehend from this rash Action And to convince you that I mean you no Harm I do assure you that the House you are going to shall be so much at your Command that even I myself will not approach it without Leave from you So make yourself easy be discreet and prudent and a happier Turn shall reward these your Troubles than you may at present apprehend  'Mean time I pity the Fatigue you will have if this comes to your Hand in the Place I have directed And will write to your Father to satisfy him that nothing but what is honourable shall be offer'd to you by  'Your passionate Admirer so I 'must style myself  'Don't think hardly of poor  Robin  You have so possess'd all my Servants in your Favour that  I find they had rather serve you than me and 'tis reluctantly the Fellow undertook this Task and I was forced to submit to assure him of my honourable Intentions to you which I am fully resolv'd to make good if you compel me not to a Conduct abhorrent to me at present'  I but too well apprehended that this Letter was only to pacify me for the present but as my Danger was not so immediate as I had Reason to dread and he had promised to forbear coming to me and to write to you my dear Parents to quiet your Concern I was a little more easy than I was before And I made shift to eat a little Bit of boil'd Chicken they had got for me and drank a Glass of my Sack and made each of them do so too  But after I had so done I was again a little fluster'd for in came the Coachman with the Look of a Hangman I thought and  Madam'd  me up strangely telling me he would beg me to get ready to pursue my Journey by Five in the Morning or else he should be late in I was quite griev'd at this for I began not to dislike my Company considering how Things stood and was in Hopes to get a Party among them and so to put myself into any worthy Protection in the Neighbourhood rather than go forward  When he withdrew I began to tamper with the Farmer and his Wife But alas they had had a Letter deliver'd them at the same time I had so securely had  Lucifer  put it into his Head to do his Work and they only shook their Heads and seem'd to pity me and so I was forced to give over that Hope  However the good Farmer shew'd me his Letter which I copy'd as follows For it discovers the deep  Arts of this wicked Master and how resolv'd he seems to be on my Ruin by the Pains he took to deprive me of all Hopes of freeing myself from his Power  '  Farmer  Norton  'I Send to your House  for one Night only  a young Gentlewoman much against her Will who has deeply embark'd in a Love Affair which will be her Ruin as well as the Person's to whom she wants to betroth herself I have  to oblige her Father  order'd her to be carry'd to one of my Houses where she will be well us'd to try if by Absence and Expostulation with both they can be brought to know their own Interest And I am sure you will use her kindly for my sake For excepting this Matter  which she will not own  she does not want Prudence and Discretion I will acknowledge any Trouble you shall be at in this Matter the first Opportunity and am  'Your Friend and Servant'  He had said too cunningly for me that I would not  own  this pretended Love Affair so that he had provided them not to believe me say what I would and as they were his Tenants who all love him for he has some good Qualities and so he had need I saw all my Plot cut out and so was forc'd to say the less  I wept bitterly however for I found he was too hard for me as well in his Contrivances as Riches and so had recourse again to my only Refuge that God who takes the innocent Heart into his Protection and is alone able to baffle and confound the Devices of the Mighty Nay the  Farmer was so prepossess'd with the Contents of his Letter to him that he began to praise his Care and Concern for me and to advise me against entertaining Addresses without my Friends Advice and Consent and made me the Subject of a Lesson for his Daughter's Improvement So I was glad to shut up this Discourse for I saw I was not likely to be believ'd  I sent however to tell my Driver that I was so fatigued I could not set out so soon the next Morning But he insisted upon it and said It would make my Day's Journey the lighter and I found he was a more faithful Servant to his Master notwithstanding what he wrote of his Reluctance than I could have wish'd So I saw still more and more that all was deep Dissimulation and Contrivance worse and worse  Indeed I might have shewn them his Letter to me as a full Confutation of his to them but I saw no Probability of engaging them in my Behalf and so thought it signify'd little as I was to go away so soon to enter more particularly into the Matter with them and besides I saw they were not inclinable to let me stay longer for fear of disobliging him So I went to Bed but had very little Rest And they would make their Servantmaid bear me Company in the Chariot five Miles early in the Morning and she was to walk back  I had contriv'd in my Thoughts when I was on my Way in the Chariot on  Friday  Morning that when we came into some Town to bait as he must do for the Horses sake I would at the Inn apply myself if I saw I any way could to the Mistress of the Inn and tell her the Case and refuse to go farther having nobody but this wicked Coachman to contend with  Well I was very full of this Project and was in great Hopes somehow or other to extricare myself this way But Oh the artful Wretch had provided for even this last Resource of mine for when we came to put up at a large Town on the Way to eat a Morsel for Dinner and I was fully resolv'd to execure my Project who should be at the Inn that he put up at but the wicked Mrs  Jewkes  expecting me And her Sisterinlaw was the Mistress of it and she had provided a little Entertainment for me  And this I found when I desir'd as soon as I came in to speak with the Mistress of the House She came to me and I said I am a poor unhappy young Body that want your Advice and Assistance and you seem to be a good sort of Gentlewoman that would assist an oppressed innocent Person Yes Madam said she I hope you guess right and I have the Happiness to know something of the Matter before you speak Pray call my Sister  Jewkes Jewkes Jewkes  thought I I have heard of that Name I don't like it  Then the wicked Creature appear'd whom I had never seen but once before and I was terrify'd out of my Wits No Stratagem thought I not  one  for a poor innocent Girl but every thing to turn out against me that is hard indeed  So I began to pull in my Horns as they say for I saw I was now worse off than at the Farmer's  The naughty Woman came up to me with an Air of Confidence and kiss'd me See Sister said she here's a charming Creature Would she not tempt the best Lord in the Land to run away with her O frightfull thought I here's an Avowal of the Matter at once I am now gone that's certain And so was quite silent and confounded and seeing no Help for it for she would not part with me out of her Sight I was forc'd to set out with her in the  Chariot for she came thither on Horseback with a Manservant who rode by us the rest of the Way with her Horse And now I gave over all Thoughts of Redemption and was in a desponding Condition indeed  Well thought I here are strange Pains taken to ruin a poor innocent helpless and even  worthless  young Body This Plot is laid too deep and has been too long a hatching to be baffled I fear But then I put my Trust in God who I knew was able to do every thing for me when all other possible Means should fail And in Him I was resolv'd to confide  You may seeYet oh that kills me for I know not whether  ever  you may see what I now write or no Else you may see what sort of Woman this Mrs  Jewkes  is compar'd to good Mrs  Jervis  by this  Every nowandthen she would be staring in my Face in the Chariot and squeezing my Hand and saying Why you are very pretty my silent Dear And once she offer'd to kiss me But I said I don't like this Sort of Carriage Mrs  Jewkes  it is not like two Persons of one Sex She fell a laughing very confidently and said That's prettily said I vow Then thou hadst rather be kiss'd by the other Sex 'Ifackins I commend thee for that  I was sadly tiez'd with her Impertinence and bold Way but no wonder she was an Innkeeper's Housekeeper before she came to my Master and those Sort of Creatures don't want Confidence you know And indeed she made nothing to talk boldly on twenty Occasions and said two or three times when she saw the Tears every nowandthen as we rid trickle down my Checks I was sorely hurt truly to have the handsomest and finest young Gentleman in five Counties in Love with me  So I find I am got into the Hands of a wicked Procuress and if I was not safe with good Mrs  Jervis  and where every body lov'd me what a dreadful Prospect have I now before me in the Hands of a Woman that seems to delight in Filthiness  O dear Sirs what shall I do What shall I do Surely I shall never be equal to all these Things  About Eight at Night we enter'd the Courtyard of this handsome large old and lonely Mansion that looks made for Solitude and Mischief as I thought by its Appearance with all its brown nodding Horrors of lofty Elms and Pines about it And here said I to myself I fear is to be the Scene of my Ruin unless God protect me who is allsufficient  I was very sick at entering it partly from Fatigue and partly from Dejection of Spirits And Mrs  Jewkes  got me some mull'd Wine and seem'd mighty officious to welcome me thither And while she was absent ordering the Wine the wicked  Robin  came in to me and said I beg a thousand Pardons for my Part in this Affair since I see your Grief and your Distress and I do assure you that I am sorry it fell to my Task  Mighty well Mr  Robert  said I I never saw an Execution but once and then the Hangman ask'd the poor Creature's Pardon and wip'd his Mouth as you do and pleaded his Duty and then calmly tuck'd up the Criminal But I am no Criminal as you all know And if I could have thought it my Duty to obey a wicked Master in his unlawful Commands I had sav'd you all the Merit of this vile Service  I am sorry said he you take it so But every body don't think alike Well said I you have done  your  Part Mr  Robert  towards my Ruin very  faithfully and will have Cause to be sorry maybe at the Longrun when you shall see the Mischief that comes of itYour Eyes were open and you knew I was to be carry'd to my Father's and that I was barbarously trick'd and betray'd and I can only once more thank you for your Part of it God forgive you  So he went away a little sad What have you said to  Robin  Madam said Mrs  Jewkes  who came in as he went out The poor Fellow's ready to cry I need not be afraid of  your  following his Example Mrs  Jewkes  said I I have been telling him that he has done  his  Part to my Ruin And he now can't help it So his Repentance does  me  no Good I wish it may  him    I'll assure you Madam said she I should be as ready to cry as he if I should do you any Harm It is not in  his  Power to help it now said I but  your  Part is to come and you may chuse whether you'll contribute to my Ruin or notWhy look ye look ye Madam said she I have a great Notion of doing my Duty to my Master and therefore you may depend upon it if I can do  that  and serve  you  I will But you must think if  your  Desire and  his  Will come to clash once I shall do as he bids me let it be what it will  Pray Mrs  Jewkes  said I don't  Madam  me so I am but a silly poor Girl set up by the Gambol of Fortune for a Maygame and now am to be Something and now Nothing just as that thinks fit to sport with me And let you and me talk upon a Foot together for I am a Servant inferior to you and so much the more as I am turn'd out of Place  Ay ay says she I understand something of the Matter you have so great Power over my Master that you may be soon Mistress of us all and so I  would oblige you if I could And I must and will call you Madam for I am instructed to shew you all Respect I'll assure you  Who instructed you to do so said I Who my Master to be sure said she Why said I how can that be You have not seen him lately No that's true said she but I have been expecting you here some time O the deeplaid Wickedness▪ thought I and besides I have a Letter of Instructions by  Robin  but maybe I should not have said so much If you would shew them to me said I I should be able to judge how far I could or could not expect Favour from you consistent with your Duty to our Master I beg your Pardon fair Mistress for that said she I am sufficiently instructed and you may depend upon it I will observe my Orders and so far as they will let me so far will I oblige you and there's an End of it  Well said I you will not I hope do an unlawful or wicked thing for any Master in the World Lookye said she he is my Master and if he bids me do a thing that I  can  do I think I  ought  to do it and let him who has Power to command me look to the  Lawfulness  of it Why said I suppose he should bid you cut my Throat would you do it There's no Danger of that said she but to be sure I would not for then I should be hang'd for that would be Murder Well said I and suppose he should resolve to ensnare a poor young Creature and ruin her would you assist him in that For to rob a Person of her Virtue is worse than cutting her Throat  Why now says she how strangely you talk Are not the two Sexes made for one another And is it not natural for a Gentleman to love a pretty Woman And suppose he can obtain his Desires is that so bad as cutting her Throat And then the Wretch fell a  laughing and talk'd most impertinently and shew'd me that I had nothing to expect from her Virtue or Conscience And this gave me great Mortification for I was in hopes of working upon her by degrees  So we ended our Discourse here and I bid her shew me where I must lie Why said she lie where you list Madam I can tell you I must lie with you for the present  For the present  said I and Torture then wrung my Heart But is it in your  Instructions  that you must lie with me Yes indeed said she I am sorry for it said I Why said she I am wholsome and cleanly too I'll assure you Yes said I I don't doubt that but I love to lie by myself How so said she was not Mrs  Jervis  your Bedfellow at t'other House  Well said I quite sick of her and my Condition you must do as you are instructed I think I can't help myself and am a most miserable Creature She repeated her insufferable Nonsense mighty miserable indeed to be so well belov'd by one of the finest Gentlemen in  England  I am now come down in my Writing to this present SATURDAY and a deal I have written  MY wicked Bedfellow has very punctual Orders it seems for she locks me and herself in and ties the two Keys for there is a double Door to the Room about her Wrist when she goes to Bed She talks of the House having been attempted to be broken open two or three times whether to fright me I can't tell but it makes me fearful tho' not so much as I should be if I had not other and greater Fears  I slept but little last Night and got up and pretended to sit by the Window which looks into the spacious Gardens but I was writing all the  time from Break of Day to her getting up and after when she was absent  At Breakfast she presented the two Maids to me the Cook and Housemaid poor awkward Souls that I can see no Hopes of they seem so devoted to her and Ignorance Yet I am resolv'd if possible to find some way to escape before this wicked Master comes  There are besides of Servants the Coachman  Robert  a Groom a Helper a Footman all but  Robert  and he is accessary to my Ruin strange Creatures that promise nothing and all likewise devoted to this Woman The Gardener looks like a good honest Man but he is kept at a Distance and seems reserv'd  I wonder'd I saw not Mr  Williams  the Clergyman but would not ask after him apprehending it might give her some Jealousy but when I had beheld the rest he was the only one I had Hopes of for I thought his Cloth would set him above assisting in my Ruin But in the Afternoon he came for it seems he has a little  Latin  School in the neighbouring Village which he attends and this brings him in a little Matter additional to my Master's Favour till something better falls of which he has Hopes  He is a sensible sober young Gentleman and when I saw him I confirm'd myself in my Hopes of him for he seem'd to take great Notice of my Distress and Grief for I could not hide it tho' he appear'd fearful of Mrs  Jewkes  who watch'd all our Motions and Words  He has an Apartment in the House but is mostly at a Lodging in the Town for Conveniency of his little School only on  Saturday  Afternoons and  Sundays  And he preaches sometimes for the Parson of the Village which is about three Miles off  I hope to go to Church with him tomorrow Sure it is not in her Instructions to deny me He can't have thought of  every  thing And something may strike out for me there  I have ask'd her for a Feint because she shan't think I am so well provided to indulge me with Pen and Ink tho' I have been using my own so freely when her Absence would let me for I begg'd to be left to myself as much as possible She says she will let me have it but then I must promise not to send any Writing out of the House without her seeing it I said It was only to divert my Grief when I was by myself as I desired to be for I lov'd Writeing but I had nobody to send to she knew well enough  No not at  present  maybe said she but I am told you are a great Writer and it is in my Instructions to see all you write so look you here said she I will let you have a Pen and Ink and two Sheets of Paper for this Employment will keep you out of worse Thoughts But I must see them always when I ask written or not written That's very hard said I but may I not have to myself the Closet in the Room where we lie with the Key to lock up my Things I believe I may consent to that said she and I will set it in Order for you and leave the Key in the Door And there is a Spinnet too said she if it be in Tune you may play to divert you nowandthen for I know my old Lady learnt you  So I resolv'd to hide a Pen of my own here and another there for fear I should come to be deny'd and a little of my Ink in a broken Chinacup and a little in another Cup and a Sheet of Paper hereandthere among my Linen with a little Wax and a few Wafers in several Places lest I should be search'd and something I thought might happen to open a  Way for my Deliverance by these or some other Means O the Pride thought I I shall have if I can secure my Innocence and escape the artful Wiles of this wicked Master For if he comes hither I am undone to be sure For this naughty Woman will assist him rather than fail in the worst of his Attempts and he'll have no Occasion to send her out of the Way as he would have done Mrs  Jervis  once So I must set all my little Wits at Work  It is a Grief to me to write and not to be able to send to you what I write but now it is all the Diversion I have and if God will favour my Escape with my Innocence as I trust He graciously will for all these black Prospects with what Pleasure shall I read them afterwards  I was going to say Pray for your dutiful Daughter as I used but alas you cannot know my Distress tho' I am sure I have your Prayers And I will write on as Things happen that if a Way should open my Scribble may be ready to send For what I do must be at a Jirk to be sure  O how I want such an obliging honesthearted Man as  John  I am now come to SUNDAY  WELL here is a sad Thing I am deny'd by this barbarous Woman to go to Church as I had built upon I might And she has huffed poor Mr  Williams  all topiece for pleading for me I find he is to be forbid the House if she pleases Poor Gentleman all his Dependence is upon my Master who has a very good Living for him if the Incumbent die and he has kept his Bed these four Months of old Age and Dropsy  He pays me great Respect and I see pities me and would perhaps assist my Escape from these Dangers But I have nobody to plead for me and why should I wish to ruin a poor Gentleman by engaging him against his Interest Yet one would do any thing to preserve one's Innocence and Providence would perhaps make it up to  him  O judge but how shall you see what I write my distracted Condition to be reduc'd to such a Pass as to desire to lay Traps for Mankind But he wants sadly to say something to me as he whisperingly hinted  The Wretch I think I will always call her the  Wretch  henceforth abuses me more and more I was but talking to one of the Maids just now indeed a little to tamper with her by degrees and she popt upon us and saidNay Madam don't offer to tempt poor innocent Country Maidens from doing their Duty You wanted I hear she should take a Walk with you But I charge you  Nan  never stir with her nor obey her without letting me know it in the smallest Trisles I say walk with you why where would you go I tro' Why barbarous Mrs  Jewkes  said I only to look a little up the Elmwalk as you would not let me go to Church  Nan  said she to shew me how much they were all in her Power pull off Madam's Shoes and bring them to me I have taken care of her others indeed she shan't said I Nay said  Nan  but I must if my Mistress bids me so pray Madam don't hinder me And so indeed would you believe it she took my Shoes off and left me barefoot And for my Share I have been so frighten'd at this that I have not Power even to relieve my Mind by my Tears I am quite stupify'd to be sure Here I was forc'd to leave off  Now I will give you a Picture of this Wretch She is a broad squat pursy  fat Thing  quite ugly if any thing human can be so called about forty Years old She has a huge Hand and an Arm as thick as my Waist I believe Her Nose is flat and crooked and her Brows grow over her Eyes a dead spiteful grey goggling Eye to be sure she has And her Face is flat and broad and as to Colour looks like as if it had been pickled a Month in Saltpetre I dare say she drinks She has a hoarse manlike Voice and is as thick as she's long and yet looks so deadly strong that I am afraid she would dash me at her Foot in an Instant if I was to vex her So that with a Heart more ugly than her Face she frightens me sadly and I am undone to be sure if God does not protect me for she is very very wickedindeed she is  This is but poor helpless Spite in meBut the Picture is too near the Truth notwithstanding She sends me a Message just now that I shall have my Shoes again if I will accept of her Company to walk with me in the GardenTo  waddle  with me rather thought I  Well 'tis not my Business to quarrel with her downright I shall be watch'd the narrower if I do and so I will go with the hated Wretch O for my dear Mrs  Jervis  or rather to be safe with my dear Father and Mother  Oh I'm out of my Wits for Joy Just as I have got my Shoes on I am told  John  honest  John  is come on Horseback A Blessing on his faithful Heart What Joy is this But I'll tell you more byandby I must not let her know I am so glad to see this dear blessed  John  to be sureO but he looks sad as I see him out of the Window What can be the Matter I hope my dear Parents are well and Mrs  Jervis  and  Mr  Longman  and every body my naughty Master not exceptedfor I wish him to live and repent of all his Wickedness to poor me  O dear Heart what a World do we live in I am now to take up my Pen again But I am in a sad Taking truly Another puzzling Trial to be sure  Here is  John  as I said and the poor Man came to me with Mrs  Jewkes  who whisper'd that I would say nothing about the Shoes for my  own  sake as she said The poor Man saw my Distress and my red Eyes and my haggard Looks I suppose for I have had a sad Time of it you must needs think and tho' he would have hid it if he could yet his Eyes ran over Oh Mrs  Pamela  said he Oh Mrs  Pamela  Well honest Fellowservant said I I cannot help it at present I am oblig'd to your Honesty and Kindness to be sure and then he wept more Said I for my Heart was ready to break to see his Grief for it is a touching thing to see a Man cry Tell me the worst Is my Master coming No no said he and sobb'd Well said I is there any News of my poor Father and Mother How do they do I hope well said he I know nothing to the contrary There is no Mishap I hope to Mrs  Jervis  or Mr  Longman  or my Fellowservants No said he poor Man with a long No as if his Heart would burst Well thank God then said I  The Man's a Fool said Mrs  Jewkes  I think what ado is here why sure thou'rt in Love  John  Dost thou not see young Madam is well What ails thee Man Nothing at all said he but I am such a Fool as to cry for Joy to see good Mrs  Pamela  But I have a Letter for you  I took it and saw it was from my Master so I put it in my Pocket Mrs  Jewkes  said I you need not  I hope see this No no said she I see whom it comes from well enough or else maybe I must desire to see it  And here is one for you Mrs  Jewkes  said he but yours said he to me requires an Answer which I must carry back early in the Morning or tonight if I can  You have no more  John  said Mrs  Jewkes  for Mrs  Pamela  have you No said he I have not but every body's kind Love and Service Ay to us both to be sure said she  John  said I I will read the Letter and pray take care of yourself for you are a good Man God bless you and I rejoice to see you and hear from you all But I long'd to say more only that nasty Mrs  Jewkes    So I went up and lock'd myself in my Closet and open'd the Letter and this is a Copy of it  My dearest  PAMELA  'I Send purposely to you on an Affair that concerns you very much and me something but chiefly for your sake I am conscious that I have proceeded by you in such a manner as may justly alarm your Fears and give Concern to your honest Friends And all my Pleasure is that I can and will make you Amends for all the Disturbance I have given you As I promis'd I sent to your Father the Day after your Departure that he might not be too much concern'd for you and assured him of my Honour to you and made an Excuse such an one as ought to have satisfy'd him for your not coming to him But this was not sufficient it seems for he poor Man came to me next Morning and set my Family almost in an Uproar about you  'O my dear Girl what Trouble has not your Obstinacy given me and yourself too I had no way to pacify him but to promise that he should see a Letter written from you to Mrs  Jervis  to satisfy him you are well  'Now all my Care in this Case is for your aged Parents lest they should be fatally touched with Grief and for you whose Duty and Affection for them I know to be so strong and laudable For this Reason I beg you will write a few Lines to them and let me prescribe the Form which I have done putting myself as near as I can in your Place and expressing your Sense with a Warmth that I doubt will have too much possess'd you  'After what is done and which cannot now be help'd but which I assure you shall turn out honourably for you I expect not to be refus'd because I cannot possibly have any View in it but to satisfy your Parents which is more  your  Concern than  mine  and so I must beg you will not alter one Tittle of the underneath If you do it will be impossible for me to send it or that it should answer the good End I propose by it  'I have promis'd to you that I will not approach you without your Leave If I find you easy and not attempting to dispute or avoid your present Lot I will keep to my Word tho' 'tis a Difficulty upon me Nor shall the present Restraint upon you last long For I will assure you that I am resolv'd very soon to convince you how ardently I am  '  Yours  c'  The Letter he prescribed for me was this  Dear Mrs  JERVIS  'I Have instead of being driven by  Robin  to my dear Father's been carry'd off to where I have no Liberty to tell However at present I am not us'd hardly and I write to beg you to let my dear Father and Mother whose Hearts must be wellnigh broken know that I am well and that I am and by the Grace of God ever will be their dutiful and honest Daughter as well as  'Your obliged Friend  'I must neither send Date nor Place but have most solemn Assurances of honourable Usage'  I knew not what to do on this most strange Request and Occasion But my Heart bled so much for you my dear Father who had taken the Pains to go yourself and inquire after your poor Daughter as well as for my dear Mother that I resolv'd to write and pretty much in the above  See p her Alterations are in a different Character  Form that it might be sent to pacify you till I could let you some how or other know the true State of the Matter And I wrote this to this strange wicked Master himself  SIR  'IF you knew but the Anguish of my Mind and how much I suffer by your dreadfully strange Usage of me you would surely pity me and consent  to my Deliverance What have I done that I should be the only Mark of your Cruelty I can have no Hope no Desire of living left me because I cannot have the least Dependence after what has pass'd upon your solemn Assurances It is impossible surely they should be consistent with the honourable Designs you profess  'Nothing but your Promise of not seeing me here in my deplorable Bondage can give me the least Ray of Hope  'Don't drive the poor distressed  Pamela  upon a Rock I beseech you that may be the Destruction both of her Body and Soul You don't know Sir how dreadfully I  dare  weak as I am of Mind and Intellect when my Virtue is in Danger And oh hasten my Deliverance that a poor unworthy Creature below the Notice of so great a Man may not be made the Sport of a high Condition for no Reason in the World but because she is not able to defend herself nor has a Friend that can right her  'I have Sir in part to shew my Obedience to you but indeed I own more to give Ease to the Minds of my poor distressed Parents whose Poverty one would think should screen them from Violences of this sort as well as their poor Daughter follow'd pretty much the Form you have prescrib'd for me to Mrs  Jervis  and the Alterations I have made for I could not help a few are of such a Nature as tho' they shew my Concern a little yet must answer the End you are pleas'd to say you propose by this Letter  'For God's sake good Sir pity my lowly Condition and my present great Misery and let me join with all the rest of your Servants to bless that Goodness which you have extended to every one but the poor afflicted heartbroken  'PAMELA'  I thought when I had written this Letter and that which he had prescrib'd it would look like placing a Confidence in Mrs  Jewkes  to shew them to her and I shew'd her at the same time my Master's Letter to me for I believ'd the Value he express'd for me would give me Credit with one who profess'd in every thing to serve him right or wrong tho' I had so little Reason I fear to pride myself in it And I was not mistaken for it has seem'd to influence her not a little and she is at present mighty obliging and runs over in my Praises but is the less to be minded because she praises as much the Author of all my Miseries and his  honourable  Intentions as she calls them when I see that she is capable of thinking as I fear  he  does that every thing that makes for his wicked Will is honourable tho' to the Ruin of the Innocent Pray God I may find it otherwise I hope whatever the wicked Gentleman may intend that I shall be at least rid of her impertinent bold way of Talk when she seems to think by his Letter that he means honourably  I am now come to MONDAY the    th Day of my Bondage and Misery  I Was in Hope to have an Opportunity to see  John  and have a little private Talk with him before he went away but it could not be The poor Man's excessive Sorrow made Mrs  Jewkes  take it into her Head to think he lov'd me and so she brought up a Message to me from him this Morning that he was going I desir'd he might come up to my Closet as I call'd it and she came with him And the honest Man as I thought him was as full of Concern as before at taking Leave And I gave him my two Letters the one for Mrs  Jervis  inclos'd in that for my Master But Mrs  Jewkes  would see me seal them up for fear of any other I was surpris'd at the Man's going away to see him drop a Bit of Paper just at the Head of the Stairs which I took up without Mrs  Jewkes  's seeing me but I was a thousand times more surpris'd when I return'd to my Closet and opening it read as follows  Good Mrs  PAMELA  'I AM griev'd to tell you how much you have been deceiv'd and betray'd and that by such a vile Dog as I Little did I think it would come to this But I must say if ever there was a Rogue in the World it is me I have all along shew'd your Letters to my Master He employ'd me for that Purpose and he saw every one before I carry'd them to your Father and Mother and then seal'd them up and sent me with them I had some Business that way but not half so often as I pretended And as soon as I heard how it was with you I was ready to hang myself You may well think I could not stand in your Presence O vile vile Wretch to bring you to this If you are ruin'd I am the Rogue that caus'd it All the Justice I can do you is to tell you you are in vile Hands and I am afraid will be undone in spite of all your sweet Innocence and I believe I shall never live after I know it If you can forgive me you are exceeding good but I shall never forgive myself that's certain Howsomever it will do you no good to make this known and mayhap I may live to do you Service If I can I will I am sure I ought Master kept your last two or three Letters and did not send them at all I am the most abandon'd Wretch of Wretches  'J ARNOLD  'You see your Undoing has been long hatching Pray take care of your sweet Self Mrs  Jewkes  is a Devil But in my Master's t'other House you have not one false Heart but myself Out upon me for a Villain'  My dear Father and Mother when you come to this Place I make no doubt your Hair will stand on End as mine doesO the Deceitfulness of the Heart of ManThis  John  that I took to be the honestest of Men that you took for the same that was always praising you to me and me to you and for nothing so much as for our  honest  Hearts this  very  Fellow was all the while a vile Hypocrite and a perfidious Wretch and helping to carry on my Ruin  But he says enough of himself and I can only sit down with this sad Reflection That Power and Riches never want Tools to promote their vilest Ends and that there is nothing so hard to be known as the Heart of ManYet I can but pity the poor Wretch since he seems to have some Remorse and I believe it best to keep his Wickedness secret and if it lies in my way to encourage his Penitence for I may possibly make some Discoveries by it  One thing I should mention in this Place he brought down in a Portmanteau all the Cloaths and Things my Lady and Master had given me and moreover two Velvet Hoods and a Velvet Scarf that used to be worn by my Lady but I have no Comfort in them or any thing else  Mrs  Jewkes  had the Portmanteau brought into my Closer and she shew'd me what was in it but then lock'd it up and said she would let me have what I would out of it when I asked but if I had the Key it might make me want to go abroad maybe and so the insolent Woman put it in her Pocket  I gave myself over to sad Reflexions upon this strange and surprizing Discovery of  John  's and wept much for him and for myself too and now I see as he says my Ruin has been so long a hatching that I can make no Doubt what my Master's  honourable  Professions will end in What a Heap of Names does the poor Fellow call himself But what must they deserve who set him to work O what has this wicked Master to answer for to be so corrupt himself and to corrupt others who would have been innocent and all to carry on further a more corrupt Scene and to ruin a poor Creature who never did him Harm nor wish'd him any and who still can pray for his Happiness and his Repentance  I can but wonder what these  Gentlemen  as they are called can think of themselves for these vile Doings  John  had  some  Inducement for he hoped to please his Master who rewarded him and was bountiful to him and the same may be said bad as she is for this same odious Mrs  Jewkes  But what Inducement has my  Master  for taking so much Pains to do the Devil's WorkIf he loves me as 'tis falsly called must he therefore lay Traps for me to ruin me and to make me as bad as himself I cannot imagine what Good the Undoing of such a poor Creature as I can procure him To be sure I am a very worthless Body People indeed say I am handsome but if I was so should not a Gentleman prefer an honest Servant to a guilty HarlotAnd must he be  more  earnest to seduce me because I dread of all Things to be seduced and would rather lose ray Life than my Honesty  Well these are strange Things to me I cannot account for them for my Share but sure nobody will say that these fine Gentlemen have any Tempter but their own wicked WillsThis naughty Master could run away from me when he thought none but  his Servants should know his base Attempts in that sad Closet Affair but is it not strange that he should not be afraid of the Allseeing Eye from which even that black poisonous Heart of his and its most secret Motions could not be hid But what avail me these sorrowful Reflections He is and will be wicked and I am I fear to be a Victim to his lawless Attempts if the God in whom I trust and to whom I hourly pray prevent it not  TUESDAY  and  WEDNESDAY    I Have been hinder'd by this wicked Woman's watching me too close from writing on  Tuesday  and so I will put both these Days together I have been a little Turn with her for an Airing in the Chariot and walked several times in the Garden but have always her at my Heels  Mr  Williams  came to see us and look a Walk with us once and while her Back was just turn'd encourag'd by the Hint he had before given me I said Sir I see two Tiles upon that Parsleybed cannot one cover them with Mould with a Note between them on OccasionA good Hint said he let that Sunflower by the Backdoor of the Garden be the Place I have a Key to that for it is my nearest way to the Town  So I was forced to begin O what Inventions will Necessity be the Parent of I hugg'd myself with the Thought and she coming to us he said as if he was continuing the Discourse we were in No not extraordinary pleasant What's that what's that said Mrs  Jewkes  Only said he the Town I'm saying is not very pleasant No indeed said she 'tis not 'tis a poor Town to my thinking Are there any Gentry in it said I And so we chatted  on about the Town to deceive her But my Deceit intended no Hurt to any body  We then talked of the Garden how large and pleasant and the like and sat down on the turfted Slope of the fine Fishpond to see the Fishes play upon the Surface of the Water and she said I should angle if I would  I wish said I you'd be so kind to fetch me a Rod and Baits Pretty Mistress said sheI know better than that I'll assure you at this timeI mean no Harm said I indeed Let me tell you said she I know no one that has their Thoughts more about them than you A body ought to look to it where you are But we'll angle a little tomorrow Mr  Williams  who is much afraid of her turn'd the Discourse to a general Subject I saunter'd in and left them to talk by themselves but he went away to Town and she was soon after me  I had got to my Pen and Ink and I said I want some Paper putting what I was about in my Bosom You know I have written two Letters and sent them by  John  O how his Name poor guilty Fellow grieves me Well said she you have some left one Sheet did for those two Letters Yes said I but I used half another for a Wrapper you know and see how I have scribbled the other Half and so I shewed her a Parcel of broken Scraps of Verses which I had try'd to recollect and which I had written purposely that she might see and think me usually employ'd to such idle Purposes Ay said she so you have well I'll give you two Sheets more but let me see how you dispose of them either written or blank Well thought I I hope still  Argus  to be too hard for thee Now  Argus  the Poets say had an hundred Eyes and was made to watch with them all as she does  She brought me the Paper and said Now Madam let me see you write something I will said I and took the Pen and wrote  "I wish Mrs  Jewkes  would be as good to me as I would be to her if I had it in my Power"  That's pretty now said she well I hope I am but what then  "Why then  wrote I  she would do me the Favour to let me know what I have done to be made her Prisoner and what she thinks is to become of me"  Well and what then said she  "Why then of Consequence  scribbled I  she would let me see her Instructions that I may know far to blame her or acquit her"  Thus I fooled on to shew her my Fondness for scribbling for I had no Expectation of any Good from her that so she might suppose I employ'd myself as I said to no better Purpose at other Times For she will have it that I am upon the some Plot I am so silent and love so much to be myself She would have me write on a little further No said I you have not answer'd me Why said she what can you doubt when my Master himself assures you of his Honour Ay said I but lay your Hand to your Heart Mrs  Jewkes  and tell me if you yourself believe him Yes said she to be sure I do But said I what do  you  call HonourWhy said she what does  he  call Honour think youRuin Shame Disgrace said I I fearPho pho said she if you have any Doubt about it he can best explain his own MeaningI'll send him Word to come to satisfy you if you willHorrid Creature said I all in a FrightCan'st thou not stab me to the Heart I'd rather thou wouldst than say such another Word But I hope there is no Thought of his coming  She had the Wickedness to say No no he don't intend to come as I know of But if I was he  I would not be long awayWhat means the Woman said IMean said she turning it off why I mean I would come if I was he and put an End to all your Fearsby making you as happy as you wish 'Tis out of his Power said I to make  me  happy great and rich as he is but by leaving me innocent and giving me Liberty to go to my dear Father and Mother  She went away soon after and I ended my Letter in Hopes to have an Opportunity to lay it in the appointed Place So I went to her and said I suppose as it is not dark I may take another Turn in the Garden 'Tis too late said she but if you will go don't stay and  Nan  see and attend Madam as she called me  So I went towards the Pond the Wench following me and dropt purposely my Hussey And when I came near the Tiles I said Mrs  Ann  I have dropt my Hussey be so kind as to look for it I had it by the Pondside The Wench went to look and I slipt the Note between the Tiles and cover'd them as quick as I could with the light Mould quite unperceiv'd and the Maid finding the Hussey I took it and saunter'd in again and met Mrs  Jewkes  coming to see after me What I wrote was this  'Reverend Sir  'THE want of Opportunity to speak my Mind to you I am sure will excuse this Boldness in a poor Creature that is betray'd hither I have Reason to think for the worst Purposes You know something to be sure of my Story my native Poverty which I am not ashamed of my late Lady's Goodness and my Master's Designs upon me 'Tis true he promises Honour and all that but the Honour of the Wicked is Disgrace and  Shame to the Virtuous And he may think he may keep his Promises according to the Notions he may allow himself to hold and yet according to mine and every good Body's beside basely ruin me  'I am so wretched and illtreated by this Mrs  Jewkes  and she is so illprincipled a Woman that as I may soon want the Opportunity which the happy Hint of this Day affords to my Hopes so I throw myself at once upon your Goodness without the least Reserve for I cannot be worse than I am should  that  fail me which I dare say to your Power it will not For I see it Sir in your Looks I hope it from your Cloth and I doubt it not from your Inclination in a Case circumstanced as my unhappy one is For Sir in helping me out of my present Distress you perform all the Acts of Religion in one and the highest Mercy and Charity both to a Body and a Soul of a poor Wretch that believe me Sir has at present not so much as in Thought swerv'd from her Innocence'  'Is there not some way to be found out for my Escape without Danger to yourself Is there no Gentleman or Lady of Virtue in this Neighbourhood to whom I may fly only till I can find a way to get to my poor Father and Mother Cannot Lady  Davers  be made acquainted with my sad Story by your conveying a Letter to her My poor Parents are so low in the World they can do nothing but break their Hearts for me and that I fear will be the End of it  'My Master promises if I will be easy as he calls it in my present Lot he will not come down without my Consent Alas Sir this is nothing For what's the Promise of a Person who thinks himself at Liberty to act as he has done by me  If he comes it must be to ruin me and come to be sure he will when he thinks he has silenc'd the Clamours of my Friends and lulled me as no doubt he hopes into a fatal Security  'Now therefore Sir is all the Time I have to work and struggle for the Preservation of my Honesty If I stay till becomes I am undone You have a Key to the back Gardendoor I have great Hopes from that Study good Sir and contrive for me I will faithfully keep your SecretYet I should be loth to have you suffer for me  'I say no more but commit this to the happy Tiles and to the Bosom of that Earth in which I hope my Deliverance will take Root and bring forth such Fruit as may turn to my inexpressible Joy and your eternal Reward both here and hereafter As shall ever pray  'Your oppressed humble Servant'  THURSDAY  THIS completes a fatal Week since my setting out as I hoped to see you my dear Father and Mother O how different were my Hopes then from what they are now Yet who knows what these happy Tiles may produce  But I must tell you first how I have been beaten by Mrs  Jewkes  'Tis very trueAnd thus it came about  My Impatience was great to walk in the Garden to see if any thing had offer'd answerable to my Hopes But this wicked Mrs  Jewkes  would not let me go without her and she said she was not at Leisure We had a great many Words about it for I said it was very hard I could not be trusted to walk by myself in the Garden for a little Air but must be dogg'd and watch'd worse than a Thief  She still pleaded her Instructions and said she was not to trust me out of her Sight And you had better said she be easy and contented I assure you for I have worse Orders than you have yet found I remember said she your asking Mr  Williams  if there were any Gentry in the Neighbourhood This makes me suspect you want to get away to them to tell your sad dismal Story as you call it  My Heart was at my Mouth for I fear'd by that Hint she had seen my Letter under the Tiles O how uneasy I was At last she said Well since you take so on you may take a Turn and I will be with you in a Minute  I went out and when I was out of Sight of her Window I speeded towards the hopeful Place but was soon forced to slacken my Pace by her odious Voice Heyday why so nimble and whither so fast said she What are you upon a Wager I stopt for her till her pursy Sides were waddled up to me and she held by my Arm half out of Breath So I was forced to pass by the dear Place without daring to look at it  The Gardener was at Work a little further and so we looked upon him and I began to talk about his Art but she said softly My Instructions are not to let you be so familiar with the Servants Why said I are you afraid I should confederate with them to commit a Robbery upon my Master Maybe I am said the odious Wretch for to rob him of yourself would be the worst that could happen to him in his Opinion  And pray said I walking on how came I to be his Property What Right has he in me but such as a Thief may plead to stolen GoodsWhy was ever the like heard says sheThis is downright Rebellion I protestWell well Lambkin which  the Foolish often calls me if I was m his Place he should not have his Property in you long questionable Why what would you do said I if you were heNot stand shillI shallI as he does but put you and himself both out of your PainWhy  Jezebel  said I I could not help it would you ruin me by ForceUpon this she gave me a deadly Slap upon my Shoulder Take that said she whom do you call  Jezebel  I was so surpris'd for you never beat me my dear Father and Mother in your Lives that I was as one thunderstruck and looked round as if I wanted somebody to help me but alas I had nobody and said at last rubbing my Shoulder Is this also in your InstructionsAlas for me am I to be beaten too And so I fell acrying and threw myself upon the Grasswalk we were uponSaid she in a great Pet I won't be call'd such Names I'll assure you Marry come up I see you have a Spirit You must and shall be kept under I'll manage such little provoking Things as you I warrant ye Come come we'll go in Doors and I'll lock you up and you shall have no Shoes nor any thing else if this is to be the Case  I did not know what to do This was a cruel thing to me and I blam'd myself for my free Speech for now I had given her some Pretence and Oh thought I here I have by my Malpertness ruin'd the only Project I had left  The Gardener saw this Scene but she called to him Well  Jacob  what do you stare at Pray mind what you're upon And away he walk'd to another Quarter out of Sight  Well thought I I must put on the Dissembler a little I see She took my Hand roughly Come get up said she and come in DoorsI'll  Jezebel  you I warrant ye Why dear Mrs  Jewkes  said  INone of your Dears and your Coaxing said she why not  Jezebel  againShe was in a fearful Passion I saw and I was out of my Wits Thought I I have often heard Women blam'd for their Tongues I wish mine had been shorter But I can't go in said I indeed I can'tWhy said she can't you I'll warrant I can take such a thin Body as you are under my Arm and carry you in if you won't walk You don't know my StrengthYes but I do said I too well and will you not use me worse when I come inSo I arose and she mutter'd to herself all the way She to be a  Jezebel  with me that had used me so well and suchlike  When I came near the House I said sitting down upon a Settlebench Well I will  not  go in till you say you will forgive me Mrs  Jewkes  If you will forgive my calling you that Name I will forgive your beating meShe sat down by me and seem'd in a great Pucker and said Well come I will forgive you for this time and so kissed me as a Mark of ReconciliationBut pray said I tell me where I am to walk and go and give me what Liberty you can and when I know the most you can favour me with you shall see I will be as content as I can and not ask you for more  Ay said she this is something like I wish I could give you all the Liberty you desire for you must think it is no Pleasure to me to tie you to my Petticoat as it were and not to let you stir without me But People that will do their Duties must have some Trouble and what I do is to serve as good a Master to be sure as livesYes said I to every body but meHe loves you too well to be sure reply'd she and that's the Reason so you ought to bear it I say  love  said I Come said she don't let the Wench see you have been crying nor tell her any Tales for you won't tell them fairly I  am sure and I'll send her and you shall take another Walk in the Garden if you will Maybe said she it will get you a Stomach to your Dinner for you don't eat enough to keep Life and Soul together You are Beauty to the Bone added the strange Wretch or you could not look so well as you do with so little Stomach so little Rest and so much pining and whining for nothing at all Well thought I say what thou wilt so I can be rid of thy bad Tongue and Company And I hop'd to find some Opportunity now to come at my Sunflower But I walked the other way to take that in my Return to avoid Suspicion  I forced my Discourse to the Wench but it was all upon general things for I find she is asked after every thing I say and do When I came near the Place as I had been devising I said Pray step to the Gardener and ask him to gather a Sallad for me to Dinner She called out  Jacob  Said I he can't hear you so far off and pray tell him I should like a Cucumber too if he has one When she had stept about a Bowshot from me I popt down and whipt my Fingers under the upper Tile and pulled out a Letter without Direction and thrust it in my Bosom trembling for Joy She was with me before I could well secure it and I was in such a taking that I feared I should discover myself You seem frighted Madam said she Why said I with a lucky Thought alas your poor Daughter will make an Intriguer byandby but I hope an innocent one I stoop'd to smell at the Sunflower and a great nasty Worm ran into the Ground that startled me for I don't love Worms Said she Sunflowers don't smell So I find reply'd I And so we walked in and Mrs  Jewkes  said Well you have made haste inYou shall go another time  I went up to my Closet lock'd myself in and opening my Letter found in it these Words  'I Am infinitely concern'd for your Distress I most heartily wish it may be in my Power to serve and save so much Innocence Beauty and Merit My whole Dependence is upon Mr  B  and I have a near View of being provided for by his Favour to me But yet I would sooner forfeit all my Hopes from him trusting in God for the rest than not assist you if possible I never look'd upon Mr  B  in the Light he now appears in to me in your Case To be sure he is no profess'd Debauchee But I am intirely of Opinion you should if possible get out of his Hands and especially as you are in very bad ones in Mrs  Jewkes  's  'We have here the Widow Lady  Jones  Mistress of a good Fortune and a Woman of Virtue I believe We have also old Sir  Simon Darnford  and his Lady who is a good Woman and they have two Daughters virtuous young Ladies All the rest are but middling People and Traders at best I will try if you please either Lady  Jones  or Lady  Darnford  if they will permit you to take Refuge with them I see no Probability of keeping myself conceal'd in this Matter but will as I said risque all things to serve you for I never saw a Sweetness and Innocence like yours and your hard Case has attach'd me intirely to you for I know as you so happily express if I can serve you in this Case I shall thereby perform all the Acts of Religion in one  'As to Lady  Davers  I will convey a Letter if you please to her but it must not be from our Posthouse I give you Caution for the Man owes all his Bread to Mr  B  and his Place too and I believe by something that dropt from  him over a Can of Ale has his Instructions You don't know how you are surrounded all which confirms me in your Opinion that no Honour is meant you let what will be professed and I am glad you want no Caution on that Head  'Give me Leave to say that I had heard much in your Praise both as to Person and Mind but I think greatly short of what you deserve My Eyes convince me of the one your Letter of the other For fear of losing the present lucky Opportunity I am longer than otherwise I should be But I will not inlarge only to assure you that I am to the best of my Power  '  Your faithful Friend and Servant  'ARTHUR WILLIAMS  'I will come once every Morning and once every Evening after Schooltime to look for your Letters I'll come in and return without going into the House if I see the Coast clear Otherwise to avoid Suspicion I'll come in'  I instantly to this pleasing Letter wrote as follows  'Reverend Sir  'O How answerable to your Function and your Character is your kind Letter God bless you for it I now think I am beginning to be happy I should be sorry you should suffer on my Account but I hope it will be made up to you an hundredfold by that God whom you so faithfully serve I should be too happy could I ever have it in my Power to contribute in the least to it But alas to serve me must be for God's  sake only for I am poor and lowly in Fortune though in Mind I hope too high to do a mean or unworthy Deed to gain a Kingdom But I lose Time  'Any way you think best I shall be pleased with for I know not the Persons nor in what manner it is best to apply to them I am glad of the Hint you so kindly give me of the Man at the Posthouse I was thinking of opening a way for myself by Letter when I could have Opportunity but I see more and more that I am indeed strangely surrounded with Dangers and that there is no Dependence to be made on my Master's Honour  'I should think Sir if either of those Ladies would give Leave I might some way get out by Favour of your Key and as it is impossible watched as I am to know when it can be suppose Sir you could get one made by it and put it by the next Opportunity under the Sunflower I am sure no Time is to be lost because it is rather my Wonder that she is not thoughtful about this Key than otherwise for she forgets not the minutest thing But Sir if I had this Key I could if these Ladies would  not  shelter me run away anywhere And if I was once out of the House they could have no Pretence to force me in again for I have done no Harm and hope to make my Story good to any compassionate Body and by this way  you  need not be known Torture should not wring it from me I assure you  'One thing more good Sir Have you no Correspondence with my Master's Family By that means maybe I could be informed of his Intentions of coming hither and when I inclose you a Letter of a deceitful Wretch for I can  trust you with anything poor  John Arnold  Its Contents will tell why I inclose it Perhaps by his means something may be discover'd for he seems willing to atone for his Treachery to me by the Intimation of future Service I leave the Hint for you to improve upon and am Reverend Sir  '  Your for ever obliged 'and thankful Servant  'I hope Sir by your Favour I could send a little Packet nowandthen somehow to my poor Father and Mother I have a little Stock of Money about five or six Guineas Shall I put half in your Hands to defray a Man and Horse or any other Incidents'  I had time but just to transcribe this before I was called to Dinner and I put that for Mr  Williams  with a Wafer in it in my Bosom to get an Opportunity to lay it in the dear Place  O good Sirs Of all the Flowers in the Garden the Sunflower sure is the loveliestIt is a propitious one to me How nobly my Plot succeeds But I begin to be afraid my Writings may be discover'd for they grow large I stitch them hitherto in my Undercoat next my Linen But if this Brute should search meI must try to please her and then she won't  Well I am but just come off from a Walk in the Garden and have deposited my Letter by a simple Wile I got some Horsebeans and we took a Turn in the Garden to angle as Mrs  Jewkes  had promis'd me She baited the Hook and I held it and soon hooked a lovely Carp Play it  play it said she I did and brought it to the Bank A sad Thought just then came into my Head and I took it and threw it in again and O the Pleasure it seem'd to have to flounce in when at LibertyWhy this says she O Mrs  Jewkes  said I I was thinking this poor Carp was the unhappy  Pamela  I was likening you and myself to my naughty Master As we hooked and deceived the poor Carp so was I betrayed by false Baits and when you said Play it play it it went to my Heart to think I should sport with the Destruction of the poor Fish I had betray'd and I could not but fling it in again And did you not see the Joy with which the happy Carp flounced from us O said I may some good merciful Body procure me my Liberty in the same manner for to be sure I think my Danger equal  Lord bless thee said she what a Thought is there Well said I I can angle no more I'll try  my  Fortune said she and took the Rod Well said I I will plant Life then if I can while you are destroying it I have some Horsebeans here and will go and stick them into one of the Borders to see how long they will be coming up and I will call them my Garden  So you see dear Father and Mother I hope now you will soon see for maybe if I can't get away so soon myself I may send my Papers somehow I say you will see that this furnishes me with a good Excuse to look after my Garden another time and if the Mould should look a little freshish it won't be so much suspected She mistrusted nothing of this and I went and stuck in here and there my Beans for about the Length of five Ells of each side of the Sunflower and easily reposited my Letter And not a little proud am I of this Contrivance Sure something will do at last  FRIDAY SATURDAY  I Have just now told you a Trick of mine now I'll tell you a Trick of this wicked Woman's She comes up to me says she I have a Bill I cannot change till Tomorrow and a Tradesman wants his Money most sadly and I don't love to turn poor Tradesfolks away without their Money Have you any about you I have a little How much will do said I Oh said she I want eight Pounds Alack said I I have but between five and six Lend me that said she till Tomorrow I did so and she went down Stairs And when she came up she laugh'd and said Well I have paid the Tradesman Said I I hope you'll give it me again Tomorrow At that the Assurance laughing loud said Why what Occasion have you for Money To tell you the Truth Lambkin I didn't want it I only fear'd you might make a bad Use of it and now I can trust  Nan  with you a little oftener especially as I have got the Key of your Portmanteau so that you can neither corrupt her with Money or fine Things Never did any body look more silly than IO how I fretted to be so foolishly outwittedAnd the more as I had hinted to Mr  Williams  that I would put some in his Hands to defray the Charges of my sending to you I cry'd for VexationAnd now I have not five Shillings left to support me if I  can  get awayWas ever such a Fool as I I must be priding myself in my Contrivances indeed Said I Was this in your Instructions  Wolfkin  for she called me  Lambkin Jezebel  you mean Child said sheWell I now forgive you heartily let's buss and be Friends Out upon you said I cannot bear you But I durst not call her Names again for I dread her  huge Paw most sadly The more I think of this thing the more do I regret it and blame myself  This Night the Man from the Posthouse brought a Letter for Mrs  Jewkes  in which was one inclosed to me She brought it me up Said she Well my good Master don't forget us He has sent you a Letter and see what he writes to me So she read That he hoped her fair Charge was well happy and contented Ay to be sure said I I can't chuseThat he did not doubt her Care and Kindness to me that I was very dear to him and she could not use me too well and the like There's a Master for you said she Sure you will love and pray for him I desir'd her to read the rest No no said she but I wont Said I Are there any Orders for taking my Shoes away and for beating me No said she nor about  Jezebel  neither Well return'd I I cry Truce for I have no mind to be beat again I thought said she we had forgiven one another  My Letter is as follows  '  My dear  PAMELA  'I Begin to repent already that I have bound myself by Promise not to see you till you give me Leave for I think the Time very tedious Can you place so much Confidence in me as to  invite  me down Assure yourself that your Generosity shall not be thrown away upon me I the rather would press this as I am uneasy for your Uneasiness for Mrs  Jewkes  acquaints me that you take your Restraint very heavily and neither eat drink nor rest well and I have too great an Interest in your Health not to wish to shorten  the Time of this Trial to you which will be the Consequence of my coming down to you  John  too has intimated to me your Concern with a Grief that hardly gave him leave for Utterance a Grief that a little alarm'd my Tenderness for you Not that I fear any thing but that your Disregard to me which yet my proud Heart will hardly permit me to own may throw you upon some Rashness that might encourage a daring Hope But how poorly do I descend to be anxious about such a Menial as he I will only say one thing that if you will give me Leave to attend you at the Hall consider  who  it is that requests this from you as a  Favour  I solemnly declare that you shall have Cause to be pleased with this obliging Mark of your Confidence in me and Consideration for me and if I find Mrs  Jewkes  has not behaved to you with the Respect due to one I so dearly love I will put it intirely into your Power to discharge her the House if you think proper and Mrs  Jervis  or who else you please shall attend you in her place This I say on a Hint  John  gave me as if you resented something from that Quarter Dearest  Pamela  answer favourably this earnest Request of one that cannot live without you and on whose Honour to you you may absolutely depend and so much the more as you place a Confidence in it I am and assuredly ever will be  '  Your faithful and affectionate  c  'You will be glad I know to hear your Father and Mother are well and easy upon your last Letter That gave me a Pleasure that I am resolved you shall not repent Mrs  Jewkes  will convey to me your Answer'  I but slightly read this Letter for the present to give way to one I had hopes of finding by this time from Mr  Williams  I took an Evening Turn as I call'd it in Mrs  Jewkes  's Company and walking by the Place I said Do you think Mrs  Jewkes  any of my Beans can have struck since Yesterday She laugh'd and said You are a poor Gardener but I love to see you divert yourself She passing on I found my good Friend had provided for me and slipping it in my Bosom for her Back was towards me Here said I having a Bean in my Hand is one of them but it was not stirr'd No to be sure said she and turn'd upon me a most wicked Jest unbecoming the Mouth of a Woman about Planting  c  When I came in I hy'd to my Closet and read as follows  'I AM sorry to tell you that I have had a Repulse from Lady  Jones  She is concerned at your Case she says but don't care to make herself Enemies I apply'd to Lady  Darnford  and told her in the most pathetick manner I could your sad Story and shew'd her your more pathetick Letter I found her well dispos'd but she would advise with Sir  Simon  who bytheby is not a Man of extraordinary Character for Virtue but he said to his Lady in my Presence Why what is all this my Dear but that our Neighbour has a mind to his Mother's Waitingmaid And if he takes care she wants for nothing I don't see any great Injury will be done her He hurts no Family by this'  So my dear Father and Mother it seems that poor Peoples Honesty is to go for nothing  'And I think Mr  Williams  you of all Men should not engage in this Affair against your Friend and Patron He spoke this in so determin'd a manner that the Lady had done and I had only  to beg no Notice should be taken of the Matter as from  me    'I have hinted your Case to Mr  Peters  the Minister of this Parish but I am concern'd to say that he imputed selfish Views to me as if I would make an Interest in your Affections by my Zeal And when I represented the Duties of our Function and the like and protested my Disinterestedness he coldly said I was very good but was a young Man and knew little of the World And tho' 'twas a Thing to be lamented yet when he and I set about to reform Mankind in this respect we should have enough upon our Hands for he said it was too common and fashionable a Case to be withstood by a private Clergyman or two And then he utter'd some Reflections upon the Conduct of the present Fathers of the Church in regard to the first Personages of the Realm as a Justification of his Coldness on this score  'I represented the different Circumstances of your Affair that other Women liv'd evilly by their own Consent but to serve you was to save an Innocence that had but few Examples and then I shew'd him your Letter  'He said It was prettily written and he was sorry for you and that your good Intentions ought to be encourag'd but what said he would you have  me  do Mr  Williams  Why suppose Sir said I you give her Shelter in your House with your Spouse and Niece till she can get to her FriendsWhat and imbroil myself with a Man of Mr  B  's Power and Fortune No not I I'll assure youAnd I would have you consider what you are about Besides she owns continued he that he promises to do honourably by her and her Shyness will procure her good Terms enough for he is no covetous nor wicked Gentleman  except in this Case and 'tis what all young Gentlemen will do  'I am greatly concern'd for him I assure you but am not discourag'd by this ill Success let what will come of it if I can serve you  'I don't hear as yet that Mr  B  is coming I am glad of your Hint as to that unhappy Fellow  John Arnold  something perhaps will strike out from that which may be useful As to your Pacquets if you seal them up and lay them in the usual Place if you find it not suspected I will watch an Opportunity to convey them but if they are large you had best be very cautious This evil Woman I find mistrusts me much  'I just hear that the Gentleman is dying whose Living Mr  B  has promis'd me I have almost a Scruple of taking it as I am acting so contrary to his Desires but I hope he'll one Day thank me for it As to Money don't think of it at present Be assured you may command all in my Power to do for you without Reserve  'I believe when we hear he is coming it will be best to make use of the Key which I shall soon procure you and I can borrow a Horse for you I believe to wait within half a Mile of the Backdoor over the Pasture and will contrive by myself or somebody to have you conducted some Miles distant to one of the Villages thereabouts so don't be discomforted I beseech you I am excellent Mrs  Pamela    '  Your faithful Friend  c  I made a thousand sad Reflections upon the former Part of this honest Gentleman's kind Letter and but for the Hope he gave me at last should have given up my Case as quite desperate I then wrote  to thank him most gratefully for his kind Endeavours to lament the little Concern the Gentry had for my deplorable Case the Wickedness of the World first to give way to such iniquitous Fashions and then plead the Frequency of them against the Attempt to amend them and how unaffected People were to the Distresses of others I recall'd my former Hint as to writing to Lady  Davers  which I fear'd I said would only serve to apprize her Brother that she knew his wicked Scheme and more harden him in it and make him come down the sooner and to be the more determin'd on my Ruin besides that it might make Mr  Williams  guess'd at as a means of conveying my Letter And being very fearful that if that good Lady  would  interest herself in my Behalf which was a Doubt because she both lov'd and fear'd her Brother it would have no Effect upon him and that therefore I would wait the happy Event I might hope for from his kind Assistance in the Key and the Horse I intimated my Master's Letter begging to be permitted to come down Was fearful it might be sudden and that I was of Opinion no Time was to be lost for we might lose all our Opportunities telling him the Moneytrick of this vile Woman  c  I had not Time to take a Copy of this Letter I was so watch'd But when I had it ready in my Bosom I was easy And so I went to seek out Mrs  Jewkes  and told her I would have her Advice upon the Letter I had receiv'd from my Master which Point of Confidence in her pleased her not a little Ay said she now this is something like And we'll take a Turn in the Garden or where you please I pretended it was indifferent to me and so we walk'd into the Garden I began to talk to her of the Letter but was far from acquainting her with  all  the Contents only that he wanted my Consent to come  down and hop'd she us'd me kindly and the like And I said Now Mrs  Jewkes  let me have your Advice as to this Why then said she I will give it you freely E'en send to him to come down It will highly oblige him and I dare say you'll fare the better for it How the  better  said I I dare say you think yourself that he intends my Ruin I hate said she that foolish Word your  Ruin  Why ne'er a Lady in the Lady may live happier than you if you will or be more honourably used  Well Mrs  Jewkes  said I I shall not at this time dispute with you about the Words  Ruin  or  honourable  for I find we have quite different Notions of both But now I will speak plainer than ever I did Do you think he intends to make Proposals to me as to a kept Mistress or kept Slave rather or do you notWhy Lambkin said she what dost thou think thyselfI fear said I he does Well said she but if he does for I know nothing of the Matter I assure you you may have your own Terms I see that for you may do any thing with him  I could not bear this to be spoken tho' it was all I fear'd of a longtime and began to exclaim most sadly Nay said she he may marry you as far as I knowNo no said I that cannot beI neither desire nor expect it His Condition don't permit me to have such a Thought and that and the whole Series of his Conduct convinces me of the contrary and you would have me invite him to come down would you Is not this to invite my Ruin  'Tis what  I  would do said she in your Place and if it was to be as you  think  I should rather be out of my Pain than live in continual Frights and Apprehension as you do No reply'd I an  Hour  of Innocence is worth an  Age  of Guilt and were my  Life to be made ever so miserable by it I should never forgive myself if I were not to lengthen out to the longest Minute my happy Time of Honesty Who knows what Providence may do for me  Why maybe said she as he loves you so well you may prevail upon him by your Prayers and Tears and for that Reason I should think you'd better let him come down Well said I I will write him a Letter because he expects an Answer or maybe he will make that a Pretence to come down How can it go  I'll take care of that said she it is in my InstructionsAy thought I so I doubt by the Hint Mr  Williams  gave me about the Posthouse  The Gardener coming by I said Mr  Jacob  I have planted a few Beans and I call the Place my Garden It is just by the Door outyonder I'll shew it you pray don't dig them up So I went on with him and when we had turn'd the Alley out of her Sight and were near the Place said I Pray step to Mrs  Jewkes  and ask her if she has any more Beans for me to plant He smil'd I suppose at my Foolishness and I popt the Letter under the Mould and stept back as if waiting for his Return which being near was immediate and she follow'd him What should  I  do with Beans said she and sadly scar'd me for she whisper'd me I am afraid of some Fetch you don't use to send of such simple Errands What Fetch said I it is hard I can neither stir nor speak but I must be suspectedWhy said she my Master writes that I must have all my Eyes about me for tho' you are as innocent as a Dove yet you're as cunning as a Serpent But I'll forgive you if you cheat me  Then I thought of my Money and could have call'd her Names had I dar'd▪ And I said Pray  Mrs  Jewkes  now you talk of forgiving me if I cheat you be so kind as to pay me my Money for tho' I have no Occasion for it yet I know you was but in Jest and intended to give it me again You shall have it in a proper time said she but indeed I was in earnest to get it out of your Hands for fear you should make an ill Use of it And so we cavilled upon this Subject as we walk'd in and I went up to write my Letter to my Master and as I intended to shew it her I resolv'd to write accordingly as to her Part of it for I made little Account of his offer of Mrs  Jervis  to me instead of this wicked Woman tho' the most agreeable thing that could have befallen me except my Escape from hence nor indeed of any thing he said For to be honourable in the just Sense of the Word he need not have caus'd me to be run away with and confin'd as I am I wrote as follows  'Honoured Sir  'WHEN I consider how easy it is for you to make me happy since all I desire is to be permitted to go to my poor Father and Mother When I reflect upon your former Proposal to me in relation to a certain Person not one Word of which is now mentioned and upon my being in that strange manner run away with and still kept here a miserable Prisoner do you think Sir pardon your poor Servant's Freedom my Fears make me bold do you think I say that your general Assurances of Honour to me can have the Effect upon me that were it not for these Things all your Words ought to have O good Sir I too much apprehend that  your  Notions of Honour and  mine  are very different from one another And I have no other Hope  but in your continued Absence If you have any Proposals to make me that are consistent with your honourable Professions in  my  humble Sense of the Word a few Lines will communicate them to me and I will return such an Answer as befits me But Oh What Proposals can one in your high Station have to make to one in my low one I know what belongs to your Degree too well to imagine that any thing can be expected but sad Temptations and utter Distress if you come down and you know not Sir when I am made desperate what the wretched  Pamela dares to do  'Whatever Rashness you may impute to me I cannot help it but I wish I may not be forced upon any that otherwise would never enter into my Thoughts Forgive me Sir my Plainness I should be loth to behave to my Master unbecomingly but I must needs say Sir my Innocence is so dear to me that all other Considerations are and I hope shall ever be treated by me as Niceties that ought for that to be dispensed with If you mean honourably why Sir should you not let me know it plainly Why is it necessary to imprison me to convince me of it And why must I be close watch'd and attended hinder'd from stirring out from speaking to any body from going so much as to Church to pray for you who have been till of late so generous a Benefactor to me Why Sir I humbly ask why all this if you mean honourablyIt is not for me to expostulate so freely but in a Case so near to me with you Sir so greatly my Superior Pardon me I hope you will but as to any the least Desire of  seeing you  I cannot bear the dreadful Apprehension Whatever you have to propose whatever you intend by me let my Assent be that of a free Person mean as I am and not of a  sordid Slave who is to be threatened and frightened into a Compliance that your Conduct to her seems to imply would be otherwise abhorr'd by her My Restraint is indeed hard upon me I am very uneasy under it Shorten it I beseech you orBut I will not dare to say more than that I am  'Your greatly oppressed unhappy Servant'  After I had taken a Copy of this I folded it up and Mrs  Jewkes  coming up just as I had done sat down by me and said when she saw me direct it I wish you would tell me if you have taken my Advice and consented to my Master's coming down If it will oblige you said I I will read it to you That's good said she then I'll love you dearly Said I then you must not offer to alter one Word I won't reply'd she So I read it to her and she prais'd me much for my Wording it but said she thought I push'd the Matter very close and it would better hear  talking  of than  writing  about She wanted an Explanation or two as about the Proposal to a  certain Person  but I said she must take it as she heard it Well well said she I make no doubt you understand one another and will do so more and more I seal'd up the Letter and she undertook to convey it  SUNDAY  FOR my part I knew it in vain to expect to have Leave to go to Church now and so I did not ask and I was the more indifferent because if I might have had Permission the Sight of the neighbouring Gentry who had despis'd my Sufferings would have given me great Regret and Sorrow and it was impossible  I should have edify'd under any Doctrine preach'd by Mr  Peters  So I apply'd myself to my private Devotions  Mr  Williams  came Yesterday and this Day as usual and took my Letter but having no good Opportunity we avoided one anothers Conversation and kept at a Distance But I was concern'd I had not the Key for I would not have lost a Moment in that Case had I been he and he me When I was at my Devotions Mrs  Jewkes  came up and wanted me sadly to sing her a Psalm as she had often on common Days importun'd me for a Song upon the Spinnet but I declin'd it because my Spirits were so low I could hardly speak nor car'd to be spoken to but when she was gone I remembering the th Psalm to be a little touching turn'd to it and took the Liberty to alter it to my Case more I hope I did not sin in it but thus I turn'd it  I  WHEN sad I sat in  Bnhall    All watched round about  And thought of ev'ry absent Friend  The Tears for Grief burst out  II  My Joys and Hopes all overthrown  My Heartstrings almost broke  Unfit my Mind for Melody  Much more to bear a Joke  III  Then she to whom I Pris'ner was  Said to me tauntingly  Now chear your Heart and sing a Song  And tune your Mind to Joy  IV  Alas said I how can I frame  My heavy Heart to sing  Or tune my Mind while thus enthrall'd  By such a wicked Thing  V  But yet if from my Innocence  I ev'n in Thought should slide  Then let my Fingers quite forget  The sweet Spinnet to guide  VI  And let my Tongue within my Mouth  Be lock'd for ever fast  If I rejoice before I see  My full Deliv'rance past  VII  And thou Almighty recompence  The Evils I endure  From those who seek my sad Disgrace  So causeless to procure  VIII  Remember Lord this Mrs  Jewkes  When with a mighty Sound  She cries Down with her Chastity  Down to the very Ground  IX  Ev'n so shalt thou O wicked One  At length to Shame be brought  And happy shall all those be call'd  That my Deliv'rance wrought  X  Yea blessed shall the Man be call'd  That shames thee of thy Evil  And saves me from thy vile Attempts  And thee too from the Dl  MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY  I Write now with a little more Liking tho' less Opportunity because Mr  Williams  has got a large Parcel of my Papers safe in his Hands to send them to you as he has Opportunity so I am not quite uselesly employ'd and I am deliver'd besides from the Fear of their being found if I should be search'd or discover'd I have been permitted to take an Airing five or six Miles with Mrs  Jewkes  But tho' I know not the Reason she watches me more closely than ever so that we have discontinued by Consent for these three Days the Sunflower Correspondence  The poor Cookmaid has had a bad Mischance for she has been hurt much by a Bull in the Pasture by the Side of the Garden not far from the Backdoor Now this Pasture I am to cross which is about half a Mile and then is a Common and near that a private Horseroad where I hope to find an Opportunity for escaping as soon as Mr  Williams  can get me a Horse and has made all ready for me For he has got me the Key which he put under the Mould just by the Door as he found an Opportunity to hint to me  He just now has signify'd that the Gentleman is dead whose Living he has had Hope of and he came pretendedly to tell Mrs  Jewkes  of it and so could speak this to her before me She wish'd him  Joy See what the World is one Man's Death is another Man's Joy Thus we thrust out one another My hard Case makes me serious He found means to slide a Letter into my Hands and is gone away He look'd at me with such Respect and Solemnness at Parting that Mrs  Jewkes  said Why Madam I believe our young Parson is half in Love with youAh Mrs  Jewkes  said I he knows better Said she I believe to sound me Why I can't see you can either of you do better and I have lately been so touch'd for you seeing how heavily you apprehend Dishonour from my Master that I think it is Pity you should not have Mr  Williams    I knew this must be a Fetch of hers because instead of being troubled for me as she pretended she watched me closer and him too and so I said There is not the Man living that I desire to marry If I can but keep myself honest it is all my Desire And to be a Comfort and Assistance to my poor Parents if it should be my happy Lot to be so is the very Top of my Ambition Well but said she I have been thinking very seriously that Mr  Williams  would make you a good Hushand and as he will owe all his Fortune to my Master he will be very glad to be sure to be oblig'd to him for a Wife of his chusing Especially said she such a pretty one and one so ingenious and genteelly educated  This gave me a Doubt whether she knew of my Master's Intimation of that sort formerly and I asked her if she had Reason to furmise that  that  was in View No she said it was only her own Thought but it was very likely that my Master had either that in View or something better for me But if I approv'd of it she would propose such a thing to her Master directly and gave a detestable Hint that I might take Resolutions upon it of  bringing such an Affair to Effect I told her I abhorr'd her vile Insinuation and as to Mr  Williams  I thought him a civil good sort of Man but as on one side he was above me so on the other of all Things I did not love a Parson So finding she could make nothing of me she quitted the Subject  I will open his Letter byandby and give you the Contents of it for she is up and down so much that I am afraid of her surprising me  Well I see Providence has not abandon'd me I shall be under no Necessity to make Advances to Mr  Williams  if I was as I am sure I am not dispos'd to it This is his Letter  'I Know not how to express myself lest I should appear to you to have a selfish View in the Service I would do you But I really know but one effectual and honourable Way to disengage yourself from the dangerous Situation you are in It is that of Marriage with some Person that you could make happy in your Approbation As for my own part it would be as Things stand my apparent Ruin and worse still I should involve you in Misery too But yet so great is my Veneration for you and so intire my Reliance in Providence on so just an Occasion that I should think myself but too happy if I might be accepted I would in this Case forego all my Expectations and be your Conductor to some safe Distance But why do I say  in this Case  That I will do whether you think fit to reward me so eminently or not And I will the Moment I hear of Mr  B  's setting out and I think now I have settled a very good Method of Intelligence of all his Motions get a Horse ready and myself to  conduct you I refer myself wholly to your Goodness and Direction and am with the highest Respect  'Your most faithful humble Servant  'Don't think this a sudden Resolution I always admir'd your hearsay Character and the Moment I saw you wish'd to serve so much Excellence  What shall I say my dear Father and Mother to this unexpected Declaration I want now more than ever your Blessing and Direction But after all I have no Mind to marry I had rather live with you But yet I would marry a Man who begs from Door to Door and has no Home nor Being rather than endanger my Honesty Yet I cannot methinks hear of being a WifeAfter a thousand different Thoughts I wrote as follows  Reverend Sir  'I AM much confused at the Contents of your last You are much too generous and I can't bear you should risque all your future Prospects for so unworthy a Creature I cannot think of your Offer without equal Concern and Gratitude for nothing but to avoid my utter Ruin can make me think of a Change of Condition and so Sir you ought not to accept of such an involuntary Compliance as mine would be were I upon the last Necessity to yield to your very generous Proposal I will rely wholly upon your Goodness to me in assisting my Escape but shall not on your Account principally  think  of the Honour you propose for me at present and never but at the Pleasure of my Parents who poor as they  are in such a weighty Point are as much intitled to my Obedience and Duty as if they were ever so rich I beg you therefore Sir not to think of any thing from me but everlasting Gratitude which will always bind me to be  'Your most obliged Servant'  THURSDAY FRIDAY SATURDAY the    th    th and    th of my Bondage  MRS  Jewkes  has received a Letter and is much civiler to me and Mr  Williams  too than she used to be I wonder I have not one in Answer to mine to my Master I suppose I put the Matter too home to him and he is angry I am not the more pleas'd for her Civility for she is horrid cunning and is not a whit less watchful I laid a Trap to get at her Instructions which she carries in the Bosom of her Stays but it has not succeeded  My last Letter is come safe to Mr  Williams  by the old Conveyance so that he is not suspected He has intimated that tho' I have not come so readily as he hop'd into his Scheme yet his Diligence shall not be slacken'd and he will leave it to Providence and myself to dispose of him as he shall be found to deserve He has signify'd to me that he shall soon send a special Messenger with the Packet to you and I have added to it what has occurr'd since  SUNDAY  I Am just now quite astonish'dI hope all is right But I have a strange Turn to acquaint you with Mr  Williams  and Mrs  Jewkes  came to me  both together he in Ecstacies she with a strange fluttering sort of Air Well said she Mrs  Pamela  I give you Joy I give you JoyLet nobody speak but me Then she sat down as out of Breath puffing and blowing Why every thing turns as I said it would said she Why there is to be a Match between you and Mr  Williams  Well I always thought it Never was so good a MasterGo to go to naughty mistrustful Mrs  Pamela  nay Mrs  Williams  said the forward Creature I may as good as call you you ought on your Knees to beg his Pardon a thousand times for mistrusting him  She was going on but I said Don't torture me thus I beseech you Mrs  Jewkes  Let me know allAh Mr  Williams  said I take care take care Mistrustful again said she why Mr  Williams  shew her your Letter and I will shew her mine They were brought by the same Hand  I trembled at the Thoughts of what this might mean and said You have so surpris'd me that I cannot stand nor hear nor read Why did you come up in such a manner to attack such weak Spirits Said he to Mrs  Jewkes  Shall we leave our Letters with Mrs  Pamela  and let her recover from her Surprize Ay said she with all my Heart here is nothing but flaming Honour and Goodwill And so saying they left me their Letters and withdrew  My Heart was quite sick with the Surprize so that I could not presently read them notwithstanding my Impatience but after awhile recovering I found the Contents thus strange and unexpected  Mr  WILLIAMS  'THE Death of Mr  Fownes  has now given me the Opportunty I have long wanted to make you happy and that in a double respect For I shall soon put you in Possession of his Living and if you have the Art of making yourself well receiv'd of one of the loveliest Wives in  England  She has not been used as she has reason to think according to her Merit but when she finds herself under the Protection of a Man of Virtue and Probity and a happy Competency to support Life in the manner to which she has been of late Years accustom'd I am persuaded she will forgive those seeming Hardships which have pav'd the Way to so happy a Lot as I hope it will be to you both I have only to account for and excuse the odd Conduct I have been guilty of which I shall do when I see you But as I shall soon set out for  London  I believe it will not be yet this Month Mean time if you can prevail with  Pamela  you need not suspend for that your mutual Happiness only let me have Notice of it first and that she approves of it which ought to be in so material a Point intirely at her Option as I assure you on the other hand I would have it at yours that nothing may be wanting to complete your Happiness I am  'Your humble Servant'  Was ever the like heardLie still my throbbing Heart divided as thou art between thy Hopes and thy FearsBut this is the Letter Mrs  Jewkes  left with me  '  Mrs  JEWKES  'YOU have been very careful and diligent in the Task which for Reasons I shall hereafter explain I had impos'd upon you Your Trouble is now almost at an End for I have written my Intentions to Mr  Williams  so particularly that I need say the less here because he will not scruple I believe to let you know the Contents of my Letter I have only one thing to mention that if you find what I have hinted to him in the least measure disagreeeble to Either you assure them Both that they are at intire Liberty to pursue their own Inclinations I hope you continue your Civilities to the mistrustful uneasy  Pamela  who now will begin to think better of hers and  '  Your Friend  c'  I had hardly time to transcribe these Letters tho' writing so much I write pretty fast before they both came up again in high Spirits and Mr  Williams  said I am glad at my Heart Madam that I was  beforehand  in my Declarations to you This generous Letter has made me the happiest Man on Earth and Mrs  Jewkes  you may be sure that if I can procure this Fairone's Consent I shall think myselfI interrupted the good Man and said Ah Mr  Williams  take care take care don't let There I stopt and Mrs  Jewkes  said Still mistrustfulI never saw the like in my LifeBut I see said she I was not wrong while my old Orders lasted to be wary of you bothI should have had a hard Task to prevent you I find for as the Saying is  Nought can restrain Consent of Twain    I doubted not her taking hold of his joyful IndiscretionI took her Letter and said Here Mrs  Jewkes  is yours I thank you for it but I have been so long in a Maze that I can say nothing of this for the present Time will bring all to Light Sir said I here is yours May every thing turn to your Happiness I give you Joy of my Master's Goodness in the LivingIt will be  dying  said he not a  Living  without youForbear Sir said I While I've a Father and Mother I am not my own Mistress poor as they are And I'll see my self quite at Liberty before I shall think my self fit to make a Choice  Mrs  Jewkes  held up her Eyes and Hands and said Such Art such Caution such Cunning for thy YearsWellWhy said I that he might be more on his Guard tho' I hope there cannot be Deceit in this 'twould be strange Villany and that is a hard Word if there should I have been so used to be made a Fool of by Fortune that I hardly can tell how to govern my self and am almost an Infidel as to MankindBut I hope I may be wrong henceforth Mrs  Jewkes  you shall regulate my Opinions as you please and I will consult you in every thingthat I think proper said I to myselffor to be sure tho' I may forgive her I can never love her  She left Mr  Williams  and me a few Minutes together and I said Consider Sir consider what you have done 'Tis impossible said he there can be Deceit I hope so said I but what Necessity was there for you to talk of your  former  Declaration Let  this  be as it will  that  could do no Good especially before this Woman Forgive me Sir they talk of Womens Promptness of Speech but indeed I see an honest Heart is not always to be trusted with itself in bad Company  He was going to reply but tho' her Task is said to be ALMOST I took Notice of that Word at an End she came up to us again and said Well I had a good mind to shew you the way to Church tomorrow I was glad of this because tho' in my present doubtful Situation I should not have chosen it yet I would have encourag'd her Proposal to be able to judge by her being in Earnest or otherwise whether one might depend upon the rest But Mr  Williams  again indiscreetly help'd her to an Excuse by saying that it was now best to defer it one  Sunday  and till Matters were riper for my Appearance and she readily took hold of it and confirm'd his Opinion  After all I hope the best but if this should turn out to be a Plot I fear nothing but a Miracle can save me But sure the Heart of Man is not capable of such black Deceit Besides Mr  Williams  has it under his own Hand and he dare not but be in Earnest and then again tho' to be sure he has been very wrong to me yet his Education and Parents Example have neither of them taught him such very black Contrivances So I will hope for the best  Mr  Williams  Mrs  Jewkes  and I have been all three walking together in the Garden and she pull'd out her Key and we walk'd a little in the Pasture to look at the Bull an ugly grim surly Creature that hurt the poor Cookmaid who is got pretty well again Mr  Williams  pointed at the Sunflower but I was forc'd to be very reserved to him for the poor Gentleman has no Guard no Caution at all  We have just supp'd together all three and I cannot yet think but all must be rightOnly I am resolv'd not to marry if I can help it and I will give no Encouragement I am resolv'd at least till I am with you  Mr  Williams  said before Mrs  Jewkes  he would send a Messenger with a Letter to my Father and MotherI think the Man has no Discretion in the World But I desire you will give no Answer till I have the Pleasure and Happiness which now I hope for soon of seeing you He will in sending my Pacquet send a most tedious Parcel of Stuff of my  Oppressions  my  Distresses  my  Fears  and so I will send this with it for Mrs  Jewkes  gives me Leave to send a Letter to my Father which looks well and I am glad I can conclude after all my Sufferings with my  Hopes  to be soon with you which I know will give you Comfort and so I rest begging the Continuance of your Prayers and Blessings  Your ever dutiful Daughter  My dear Father and Mother  I Have so much Time upon my Hands that I must write on to employ myself The  Sunday Evening  where I left off Mrs  Jewkes  asked me If I chose to lie by myself I said Yes with  all  my Heart if she pleased Well said she after tonight you shall I ask'd her for more Paper and she gave me a little Bottle of Ink eight Sheets of Paper which she said was all her Store for now she would get me to write for her to our Master if she had Occasion and six Pens with a piece of Sealingwax This looks mighty well  She press'd me when she came to Bed very much to give Encouragement to Mr  Williams  and said many things in his Behalf and blam'd my Shyness to him I told her I was resolv'd to give no Encouragement till I had talk'd to my Father and Mother She said she fancy'd I thought of somebody else or I could never be so insensible I assur'd  her as I could do very safely that there was not a Man on Earth I wish'd to have and as to Mr  Williams  he might do better by far and I had proposed so much Happiness in living with my poor Father and Mother that I could not think of any Scheme of Life with Pleasure till I had try'd that I ask'd her for my Money and she said it was above in her strong Box but that I shall have it tomorrow All these Things look well as I said  Mr  Williams  would go home this Night tho' late because he would dispatch a Messenger to you with a Letter he had propos'd from himself and my Pacquet But pray don't encourage him as I said for he is much too heady and precipitate as to this Matter in my way of thinking tho' to be sure he is a very good Man and I am much oblig'd to him  MONDAY Morning  ALasaday we have bad News from poor Mr  Williams  He has had a sad Mischance fallen among Rogues in his Way home last Night but by good Chance has sav'd my Papers This is the Account he gives of it to Mrs  Jewkes    '  Good Mrs  JEWKES  'I Have had a sore Misfortune in going from you When I had got as near the Town as the Dam and was going to cross the Woodenbridge two Fellows got hold of me and swore bitterly they would kill me if I did not give them what I had They romag'd my Pockets and took from me my SnuffBox my Sealring and Half a Guinea and some Silver and Halfpence also my Handkerchief  and two or three Letters I had in my Pocket By good Fortune the Letter Mrs  Pamela  gave me was in my Bosom and so that escap'd but they bruis'd my Head and Face and cursing me for having no more Money tipt me into the Dam Crying Lie there Parson till tomorrow My Shins and Knees were bruis'd much in the Fall against one of the Stumps and I had like to have been suffocated in Water and Mudd To be sure I shan't be able to stir out this Day or two For I am a fearful Spectacle My Hat and Wig I was forc'd to leave behind me and go home a Mile and a half without but they were found next Morning and brought me with my Snuffbox which the Rogues must have dropt My Cassock is sadly torn as is my Band To be sure I was much frighted for a Robbery in these Parts has not been known many Years Diligent Search is making after the Rogues My humblest Respects to good Mrs  Pamela  If  she  pities my Misfortunes I shall be the sooner well and fit to wait on her and you This did not hinder me in writing a Letter tho' with great Pain as I do this  To be sure this good Man can keep no Secret  and sending it away by a Man and Horse this Morning I am good Mrs  Jewkes    'Your most obliged humble Servant  'God be prais'd it is no worse and I find I have got no Cold tho' miserably wet from Top to Toe My Fright I believe prevented me from catching Cold for I was not rightly myself for some Hours and know not how I got home I will write a Letter of Thanks this Night if I am able to my kind Patron for his inestimable Goodness to me I wish I was enabled to  say all I hope with regard to the  better Part  of his Bounty to me incomparable Mrs  Pamela  '  The wicked Brute fell a laughing when she had read this Letter till her fat Sides shook said she I can but think how the poor Parson look'd after parting with his pretty Mistress in such high Spirits when he found himself at the bottom of the Dam And what a Figure he must cut in his tatter'd Band and Cassock and without Hat and Wig when he got Home I warrant said she he was in a sweet PickleI said I thought it was very barbarous to laugh at such a Misfortune But she said As he was safe she laughed otherwise she should have been sorry And she was glad to see me so concern'd for himIt look'd  promising  she said  I heeded not her Reflection but as I have been used to Causes for Mistrusts I cannot help saying that I don't like this thing And their taking his Letters most alarms meHow happy it was they miss'd my Pacquet I know not what to think of itBut why should I let every Accident break my Peace But yet it  will  do so while I stay here  Mrs  Jewkes  is mightily at me to go with her in the Chariot to visit Mr  Williams  She is so officious to bring on the Affair between us that being a cunning artful Woman I know not what to make of it I have refused her absolutely urging that except I intended to encourage his Suit I ought not to do it And she is gone without me  I have strange Temptations to get away in her Absence for all these fine Appearances 'Tis sad to have no body to advise withI know not what to do But alas for me I have no Money if I should to buy any body's Civilities or to pay for  Necessaries or Lodging But I'll go into the Garden and resolve afterwards  I have been in the Garden and to the Backdoor and there I stood my Heart up at my Mouth I could not see I was watch'd so this looks well But if any thing should go bad afterwards I should never forgive myself for not taking this Opportunity Well I will go down again and see if all is clear and how it looks out at the Backdoor in the Pasture  To be sure there is Witchcraft in this House and I believe  Lucifer  is bribed as well as all about me and is got into the Shape of that nasty grim Bull to watch meFor I have been down again and ventur'd to open the Door and went out about a Bowshoot into the Pasture but there stood that horrid Bull staring me full in the Face with fiery saucer Eyes as I thought So I got in again for fear he should come at me Nobody saw me howeverDo you think there are such things as Witches and Spirits if there be I believe in my Heart Mrs  Jewkes  has got this Bull of her Side But yet what could I do without Money or a Friend O this wicked Woman to trick me so Every thing Man Woman and Beast is in a Plot against your poor  Pamela  I thinkThen I know not one step of the way nor how far to any House or Cottage and whether I could gain Protection if I got to a House And now the Robbers are abroad too I may run into as great Danger as I want to escape from nay greater much if these promising Appearances hold And sure my Master cannot be so black as that they should notWhat can I doI have a good mind to try for it once more but then I may be pursued and taken and it will be worse for me and this wicked Woman  will beat me and take my Shoes away and lock me up  But after all if my Master should mean  well  he can't be angry at my Fears if I  should  escape and no body can blame me and I can more easily be induced with you when all my Apprehensions are over to consider his Proposal of Mr  Williams  than I could here and he pretends as you have read in his Letter he will leave me at my Choice Why then should I be afraid I will go down again I think But yet my Heart misgives me because of the Difficulties before me in escaping and being so poor and so friendless O good God the Preserver of the Innocent direct me what to do  Well I have just now a sort of strange Persuasion upon me that I ought to try to get away and leave the Issue to Providence So once more I'll see at least if this Bull be still there  Alackaday what a Fate is this I have not the Courage to go neither can I think to stay But I must resolve The Gardner was in Sight last time so made me come up again But I'll contrive to send him out of the way if I canFor if I never should have such another Opportunity I could not forgive myself Once more I'll venture God direct my Footsteps and make smooth my Path and my Way to Safety  Well here I am come back again frighted like a Fool out of all my Purposes O how terrible every thing appears to me I had got twice as far again as I was before out of the Back door and I looked and saw the Bull as I thought between me and the Door and another Bull coming towards me the other way Well thought I here is double Witchcraft to be sure Here is the Spirit of my  Master in one Bull and Mrs  Jewkes  's in the other and now I am gone to be sure O help cry'd I like a Fool and run back to the Door as swift as if I flew When I had got the Door in my Hand I ventur'd to look back to see if these supposed Bulls were coming and I saw they were only two poor Cows a grazing in distant Places that my Fears had made all this Rout about But as every thing is so frightful to me I find I am not fit to think of my Escape For I shall be as much frighted at the first strange Man that I meet with And I am persuaded that Fear brings one into more Dangers than the Caution that goes along with it delivers one from  I then locked the Door and put the Key in my Pocket and was in a sad Quandary but I was soon determined for the Maid  Nan  came in Sight and asked if any thing was the matter that I was so often up and down Stairs God forgive me but I had a sad Lye at my Tongue's End said I Tho' Mrs  Jewkes  is sometimes a little hard upon me yet I know not where I am without her I go up and I come down to walk about in the Garden and not having her know scarcely what to do with myself Ay said the Idiot she is main good Company Madam no wonder you miss her  So here I am again and here likely to be for I have no Courage to help myself anywhere else O why are poor foolish Maidens try'd with such Dangers when they have such weak Minds to grapple with them I will since it is so hope the best But yet I cannot but observe how grievously every thing makes against me For here are the Robbers tho' I fell not into their Hands myself yet they gave me as much Terror and had as great an Effect upon my Fears as if I had And here is the  Bull it has as effectually frighten'd me as if I had been hurt by it instead of the Cookmaid and so they join'd together as I may say to make a very Dastard of me But my Folly was the worst of all for that deprived me of my Money for had I had  that  I believe I should have ventur'd the other Two  MONDAY Afternoon  SO Mrs  Jewkes  is returned from her Visit Well said she I would have you set your Heart at rest for Mr  Williams  will do very well again He is not half so badly off as he fancy'd O these Scholars said she they have not the Hearts of Mice He has only a few Scratches on his Face which said she I suppose he got by grabbling among the Gravel at the bottom of the Dam to try to find a Hole in the Ground to hide himself from the Robbers His Shin and his Knee are hardly to be seen to all any thing He says in his Letter he was a frightful Spectacle He might be so indeed when he first came in adoors but he looks well enough now and only for a few Groans nowandthen when he thinks of his Danger I see nothing is the matter with him So Mrs  Pamela  said she I would have you be very easy about it I am glad of it said I for all your Jokes Mrs  Jewkes    Well said she he talks of nothing but you and when I told him I would fain have persuaded you to come with me the Man was out of his Wits with his Gratitude to me and so has laid open all his Heart to me and told me all that has passed and was contriving between you two This alarm'd me prodigiously and the rather as I saw by two or three Instances that his honest Heart could keep nothing believing every one as undesigning as himself  I said but yet with a heavy Heart ah Mrs  Jewkes  Mrs  Jewkes  this might have done with me had he had any thing that he could have told you of But you know well enough that had we been disposed we had no Opportunity for it from your watchful Care and Circumspection No said she that's very true Mrs  Pamela  not so much as for that Declaration that he own'd before me he had found Opportunity for all my Watchfulness to make you Come come said she no more of these Shams with me You have an excellent Headpiece for your Years but maybe I am as cunning as youHowever said she all is well now because my  Watchments  are now over by my Master's Direction How have you employ'd yourself in my Absence  I was so troubled at what might have passed between Mr  Williams  and her that I could not hide it And she said Well Mrs  Pamela  since all Matters are likely to be so soon and so happily ended let me advise you to be a little less concern'd at his Discoveries and make me your Confident as  he  has done and I shall think you have some Favour for me and Reliance upon me and perhaps you might not repent it  She was so earnest that I mistrusted she did this to pump me and I knew how now to account for her Kindness to Mr  Williams  in her Visit to him which was only to get out of him what she could Why Mrs  Jewkes  said I is all this fishing about for something where there is nothing if there be an end of your  Watchments  as you call them Nothing said she but Womanish Curiosity I'll assure you for one is naturally led to find out Matters where there is such Privacy intended Well said I pray let me know what he has said and then I'll give you an Answer to your Curiosity I don't  care said she whether you do or not for I have as much as I wanted from him and I despair of getting out of you any thing you han't a mind I should know my little cunning Dear Well said I let him have said what he would I care not for I am sure he can say no Harm of me and so let us change the Talk  I was the easier indeed because for all her Pumps she gave no Hints of the Key and the Door  c  which had he communicated to her she would not have forborn giving me a Touch of And so we gave up one another as despairing to gain our Ends of each other But I am sure he must have said more than he should And I am the more apprehensive all is not right because she has now been actually these two Hours shut up a writing tho' she pretended she had given me up all her Stores of Paper  c  and that I should write for her I begin to wish I had ventur'd every thing and gone off when I might O when will this State of Doubt and Uneasiness end  She has just been with me and says she shall send a Messenger to  Bedfordshire  and he shall carry a Letter of Thanks for me if I will write it for my Master's Favour to me Indeed said I I have no Thanks to give till I am with my Father and Mother And besides I sent a Letter as you know but have had no Answer to it She said she thought that his Letter to Mr  Williams  was sufficient and the least I could do was to thank him if but in two Lines No need of it said I for I don't intend to have Mr  Williams  What then is that Letter to me Well said she I see thou art quite unfathomable  I don't like all this O my foolish Fears of Bulls and Robbers For now all my Uneasiness begins to double upon me O what has this uncautious  Man said That no doubt is the Subject of her long Letter  I will close this Day's writing with just saying that she is mighty silent and reserved to what she was and says nothing but No or Yes to what I ask Something must be hatching I doubt I the rather think so because I find she does not keep her word with me about lying by myself and my Money to both which Points she returned suspicious Answers saying as to the one Why you are mighty earnest for your Money I shan't run away with it And to the other Good lack you need not be so willing as I know of to part with me for a Bedfellow till you are sure of one you  like better  This cut me to the HeartAnd at the same time stopt my Mouth  TUESDAY WEDNESDAY  MR  Williams  has been here but we have had no Opportunity to talk together He seem'd confounded at Mrs  Jewkes  's Change of Temper and Reservedness after her kind Visit and their Freedom with one another and much more at what I am going to tell you He asked if I would take a Turn in the Garden with Mrs  Jewkes  and him No said she I can't go Said he may not Mrs  Pamela  take a Walk No said she I desire she won't Why Mrs  Jewkes  said he I am afraid I have somehow disobliged you Not at all reply'd she but I suppose you will soon be at Liberty to walk together as much as you please And I have sent a Messenger for my last Instructions about  this  and  more  weighty Matters and when they come I shall leave you to do as you both will but till then it is no matter how little you are together This alarm'd us both and he seem'd quite struck of a  Heap and put on as I thought a selfaccusing Countenance So I went behind her Back and held my two Hands together flat with a Bit of Paper I had between them and looked at him and he seemed to take me as I intended intimating the renewing of the Correspondence by the Tiles  So I left them both together and retired to my Closet to write a Letter for the Tiles but having no Time for a Copy I will give you the Substance only  I expostulated with him on his too great Openness and Easiness to fall into Mrs  Jewkes's  Snares told him my Apprehensions of foul Play and gave briefly the Reasons which moved me Begg'd to know what he had said and intimated that I thought there was the highest Reason to resume our Project of the Escape by the BackDoor I put this in the usual Place in the Evening and now wait with Impatience for an Answer  THURSDAY  I Have the following Answer  'Dearest Madam  'I Am utterly confounded and must plead guilty to all your just Reproaches I wish I were Master of but half your Caution and Discretion I hope after all this is only a Touch of this ill Woman's Temper to shew her Power and Importance For I think Mr  B  neither can nor dare deceive me in so black a manner I would expose him all the World over if he did But it  is not cannot  be in him I have received a Letter from  John Arnold  in which he tells me that his Master is preparing for his  London  Journey and believes afterwards he will come into these Parts  But he says Lady  Davers  is at their House and is to accompany her Brother to  London  or meet him there he knows not which He professes great Zeal and Affection to your Service But I find he refers to a Letter he sent me before but which is not come to my Hand I  think  there can be no Treachery for it is a particular Friend at  Gainsborough  that I have order'd him to direct to and this is come safe to my Hands by this means for well I know I durst trust nothing to  Brett  at the Posthouse here This gives me a little Pain but I hope all will end well and we shall soon hear if it be necessary to pursue our former Intentions If it be I will lose no time to provide a Horse for you and another for myself for I can never do either God or myself better Service tho' I were to forego all my Expectations for it here I am  'Your most faithful humble Servant  'I was too free indeed with Mrs  Jewkes  led to it by her Dissimulation and by her pretended Concern to make me happy with you I hinted that I would not have scrupled to have procured your Deliverance by any means and that I had proposed to you as the only honourable one Marriage with me But I assured her tho' she would hardly believe me that you discouraged my Application Which is too true But not a Word of the Backdoor Key  c  Mrs  Jewkes  continues still sullen and illnatur'd and I am almost afraid to speak to her She watches me as close as ever and pretends to wonder why I shun her Company as I do  I have just put under the Tiles these Lines inspired by my Fears which are indeed very strong and I doubt not without Reason  'Sir  'EVERY thing gives me additional Disturbance The miss'd Letter of  John Arnold  's makes me suspect a Plot Yet am I loth to think myself of so much Importance as to suppose every one in a Plot against me Are you sure however the  London  Journey is not to be a  Lincolnshire  one may not  John  who has been once a Traitor be so again Why  need  I be thus in doubt If I could have this Horse I would turn the Reins on his Neck and trust to Providence to guide him for my Safeguard For I would not endanger you now just upon the Edge of your Preferment Yet Sir I fear your fatal Openness will make you suspected as accessary let us be ever so cautious  'Were my  Life  in question instead of my  Honesty  I would not wish to involve you or any body in the least Difficulty for so worthless a poor Creature But O Sir my  Soul  is of equal Importance with the Soul of a Princess though my Quality is inferior to that of the meanest Slave  'Save then my Innocence good Heaven and preserve my Mind spotless and happy shall I be to lay down my worthless Life and see an End to all my Troubles and Anxieties  'Forgive my Impatience But my presaging Mind bodes horrid Mischiefs Every thing looks dark around me and this Woman's impenetrable Sullenness and Silence without any apparent Reason from a Conduct so very  contrary  bids me fear the worst Blame me Sir if you think me  wrong and let me have your Advice what to do which will oblige  'Your most afflicted Servant  FRIDAY  I Have this halfangry Answer but what is more to me than all the Letters in the World could be yours my dear Father inclosed  'Madam  'I Think you are too apprehensive by much I am sorry for your Uneasiness You may depend upon me and all I can do But I make no doubt of the  London  Journey nor of  John's  Contrition and Fidelity I have just received from my  Gainsborough  Friend this Letter as I suppose from your good Father in a Cover directed for me as I had desired I hope it contains nothing to add to your Uneasiness Pray dearest Madam lay aside your Fears and wait a few Days for the Issue of Mrs  Jewkes  's Letter and mine of Thanks to Mr  B  Things I hope  must  be better than you expect Providence will not desert such Piety and Innocence and be this your Comfort and Reliance Which is the best Advice that can at present be given by  'Your most faithful humble Servant'  N B  The Father's Letter was as follows  My dearest Daughter  'OUR Prayers are at length heard and we are overwhelmed with Joy O what Sufferings what Trials hast thou gone thro' Blessed be the Divine Goodness which has enabled thee  to withstand so many Temptations We have not yet had Leisure to read thro' your long Accounts of all your Hardships I say  long  because I wonder how you could find Time and Opportunity for them but otherwise they are the Delight of our spare Hours and we shall read them over and over as long as we live with Thankfulness to God who has given us so virtuous and so discreet a Daughter How happy is our Lot in the midst of our Poverty O let none ever think Children a Burden to them when the poorest Circumstances can produce so much Riches in a  Pamela  Persist my dear Daughter in the same excellent Course and we shall not envy the highest Estate but defy them to produce such a Daughter as ours  'I said we had not read thro' all yours in Course We were too impatient and so turn'd to the End where we find your Virtue within View of its Reward and your Master's Heart turn'd to see the Folly of his Ways and the Injury he had intended to our dear Child For to be sure my Dear he  would  have ruin'd you if he could But seeing your Virtue his Heart is touched and he has no doubt been awaken'd by your good Example  'We don't see that you can do any way so well as to come into the present Proposal and make Mr  Williams  the worthy Mr  Williams  God bless himhappy And tho' we are poor and can add no Merit no Reputation no Fortune to our dear Child but rather must be a Disgrace to her as the World will think yet I hope I do not sin in my Pride to say that there is no good Man of a common Degree especially as your late Lady's Kindness gave you such good Opportunities which you have had the Grace to improve but may think himself happy in you But as you say  you had rather  not  marry at present far be it from us to offer Violence to your Inclinations So much Prudence as you have shewn in all your Conduct would make it very wrong in us to mistrust it in this or to offer to direct you in your Choice But alas my Child what can  we  do for youTo partake our hard Lot and involve yourself into as hard a Life would not help  us  but  add  to our Afflictions But it is time enough to talk of these things when we have the Pleasure you now put us in Hope of of seeing you with us which God grant  Amen Amen  say  '  Your most indulgent Parents  Amen  'Our humblest Service and Thanks to the worthy Mr  Williams  Again we say God bless him for ever  'O what a deal we have to say to you God give us a happy Meeting We understand the 'Squire is setting out for  London  He is a fine Gentleman and has Wit at Will I wish he was as good But I hope he will now reform'  O what inexpressible Comfort my dear Father has your Letter given me You ask  What  can you do for meWhat is it you  cannot do  for your Child You can give her the Advice she  has so much  wanted and  still  wants and will  always  want You can confirm her in the Paths of Virtue into which you first initiated her and you can pray for her with Hearts so sincere and pure that are not to be met with in PalacesOh how I long to throw myself at your Feet and receive from your own Lips the Blessings of such good Parents But alas how are my Prospects again overclouded to what they  were when I closed my last ParcelMore Trials more Dangers I fear must your poor  Pamela  be engaged in But thro' the Divine Goodness and your Prayers I hope at last to get well out of all my Difficulties and the rather as they are not the Effect of my own Vanity or Presumption  But I will proceed with my hopeless Story I saw Mr  Williams  was a little nettled at my Impatience and so I wrote to assure him I would be as easy as I could and wholly directed by him especially as my Father whose Respects I mentioned had assured me my Master was setting out for  London  which he must have somehow from his own Family or he would not have written me word of it  SATURDAY SUNDAY  MR  Williams  has been here both these Days as usual but is very indifferently received still by Mrs  Jewkes  and to avoid Suspicion I left them together and went up to my Closet most of the Time he was here He and she I found by her had a Quarrel and she seems quite out of Humour with him but I thought it best not to say any thing And he said he would very little trouble the House till he had an Answer to his Letter from Mr  B  And she return'd The less the better Poor Man he has got but little by his Openness and making Mrs  Jewkes  his Confident as she bragged and would have had me to do likewise  I am more and more satisfied there is Mischief brewing and shall begin to hide my Papers and be circumspect She seems mighty impatient for an Answer to her Letter to my Master  MONDAY TUESDAY the    th and    th Days of my heavy Restraint  STILL more and more strange things to write A Messenger is return'd and now all is out O wretched wretched  Pamela  What at last will become of me Such strange Turns and Trials sure never poor Creature of my Years experienced He brought two Letters one to Mrs  Jewkes  and one to me But as the greatest Wits may be sometimes mistaken they being folded and sealed alike that for  me  was directed to Mrs  Jewkes  and that for  her  was directed to me But  both  are stark naught abominably bad She brought me up that directed for me and said Here's a Letter for you Long look'dfor is come at last I will ask the Messenger a few Questions and then I will read mine So she went down and I broke it open in my Closet and found it directed  To Mrs  PAMELA ANDREWS But when I open'd it it began Mrs  Jewkes  I was quite confounded but thinks I this may be a lucky Mistake I may discover something And so I read on these horrid Contents  '  Mrs  JEWKES  'WHAT you write me has given me no small Disturbance This wretched  Fool's Plaything  no doubt is ready to leap at  any thing  that offers rather than express the least Sense of Gratitude for all the Benefits she has received from my Family and which I was determined more and more to heap upon her I reserve her for my future Resentment and I charge you double your Diligence in watching her to prevent her Escape I send this by an honest  Swiss  who attended me in my Travels a Man I  can trust and so let him be your Assistant For the  artful Creature  is enough to corrupt a Nation by her seeming Innocence and Simplicity and she may have got a Party perhaps among my Servants with you as she has here Even  John Arnold  whom I confided in and favour'd more than any has proved an execrable Villain and shall meet his Reward for it  'As to that  College Novice Williams  I need not bid you take care he sees not this  painted Bauble  for I have order'd Mr  Shorter  my Attorney to throw him instantly into Goal on an Action of Debt for Money he has had of me which I had intended never to carry to account against him for I know all his rascally Practices besides what you write me of his perfidious Intrigue with that Girl and his acknowledged Contrivances for her Escape when he knew not for certain that I design'd her any Mischief and when if he had been guided by a Sense of Piety or Compassion for injured Innocence as he pretends he would have expostulated with me as his Function and my Friendship for him might have allow'd him But to enter into a vile Intrigue charm'd like a godly Sensualist with the  amiable Gewgaw  to favour her Escape in so base a manner to say nothing of his disgraceful Practices against me in Sir  Simon Darnford  's Family of which Sir  Simon  himself has inform'd me is a Conduct that instead of preferring the ingrateful Wretch as I had intended shall pull down upon him utter Ruin  'Monsieur  Colbrand  my trusty  Swiss  will obey 'you without Reserve if my other Servants refuse  'As for her denying that she encouraged his Declaration I believe it not 'Tis certain the  speaking Picture  with all that pretended Innocence and Bashfulness would have run away with  him Yes she would have run away with a Fellow that she had been acquainted with and that not intimately if you was as careful as you ought to be but few Days at a time when she had the strongest Assurances of my Honour to her  'Well I think I now  hate her  perfectly and tho' I will do nothing to her  myself  yet I can bear for the sake of my Revenge and my  injur'd Honour  and  slighted Love  to see any thing even what  she most fears  be  done to her  and then she may be turned loose to her evil Destiny and echo to the Woods and Groves her piteous Lamentations for the Loss of her fantastical Innocence which the romantic Idiot makes such a work about I shall go to  London  with my Sister  Davers  and the Moment I can disengage myself which perhaps may be in three Weeks from this time I will be with you and decide  her Fate  and put an End to your Trouble Mean time be doubly careful for this Innocent as I have warn'd you is full of Contrivances I am  'Your Friend'  I had but just read this dreadful Letter thro' when Mrs  Jewkes  came up in a great Fright guessing at the Mistake and that I had her Letter and she found me with it open in my Hand just sinking away What Business said she had you to read my Letter and snatch'd it from me You see said she looking upon it it says  Mrs Jewkes  at top You ought in Manners to have read no further O add not said I to my Afflictions I shall be soon out of all your ways This is too much too much I never can support thisand threw myself upon the Couch in my Closet and wept most bitterly She read it in the next Room and came in again  afterwards Why this said she is a sad Letter indeed I am sorry for it But I fear'd you would carry your Niceties too farLeave me leave me Mrs  Jewkes  said I for awhile I cannot speak nor talk Poor Heart said she well I'll come up again presently and hope to find you better But here take your own Letter I wish you well but this is a sad Mistake And so she put down by me that which was intended for me But I have no Spirit to read it at present O Man Man hardhearted cruel Man what Mischiefs art thou not capable of unrelenting Persecutor as thou art  I sat ruminating when I had a little come to myself upon the Terms of this wicked Letter and had no Inclination to look into my own The bad Names  Fool's Plaything artful Creature painted Bauble Gewgaw speaking Picture  are hard Words for your poor  Pamela  and I began to think whether I was not indeed a very naughty Body and had not done vile Things But when I thought of his having discover'd poor  John  and of Sir  Simon  's base Officiousness in telling him of Mr  Williams  with what he had resolved against him in Revenge for his Goodness to me I was quite dispirited and yet still more about that fearful  Colebrand  and what he could  see done to me  for then I was ready to gasp for Breath and my Heart quite failed me Then how dreadful are the Words that he will  decide my Fate  in three Weeks Gracious Heaven said I strike me dead before that time with a Thunderbolt or provide some way for my escaping these threaten'd Mischiefs God forgive me if I sinned  At last I took up the Letter directed for Mrs  Jewkes  but designed for me and I find  that  little better than the other These are the hard Terms it contains  'WELL have you done perverse forward artful yet foolish  Pamela  to convince me before it was too late how ill I had done to place my Affections on so unworthy an Object I had vow'd Honour and Love to your Unworthiness believing you a Mirror of bashful Modesty and unspotted Innocence and that no perfidious Designs lurked in so fair a Bosom But now I have found you out you specious Hypocrite and I see that tho' you could not repose the least Confidence in one you had known for Years and who under my good Mother's misplaced Favour for you had grown up in a manner with you when my Passion in spite of my Pride and the Difference of our Condition made me stoop to a Meanness that now I despise myself for yet you could enter into an Intrigue with a Man you never knew till within these few Days past and resolve to run away with a Stranger whom your fair Face and insinuating Arts had bewitched to break thro' all the Ties of Honour and Gratitude to me even at a Time when the Happiness of his future Life depended upon my Favour  'Henceforth for  Pamela  's sake whenever I see a lovely Face will I mistrust a deceitful Heart And whenever I hear of the greatest Pretences to Innocence will I suspect some deep laid Mischief You were determin'd to place no Confidence in me tho' I have solemnly over and over engaged my Honour to you What tho' I had alarm'd your Fears in sending you one way when you hoped to go another yet had I not to convince you of my Resolution to do justly by you altho' with great Reluctance such then was my Love for you engaged not to come near you without  your own Consent Was not this a voluntary Demonstration of the Generosity of my Intentions to you Yet how have you requited me The very first Fellow that your charming Face and insinuating Address could Influence you have practis'd upon corrupted too I may say and even ruin'd as the ingrateful Wretch shall find and thrown your  forward  Self upon him As therefore you would place no Confidence in me my Honour owes you nothing and in a little time you shall find how much you have err'd in treating as you have done a Man who was once  'Your affectionate and kind Friend  'Mrs  Jewkes  has Directions concerning you And if your Lot is now harder than you might wish you will bear it the easier because your own rash Folly has brought it upon you  Alas for me what a Fate is mine to be thus thought artful and forward and ingrateful when all I intended was to preserve my Innocence and when all the poor little Shifts which his superior wicked Wit and Cunning have render'd ineffectual were forced upon me in my own necessary Defence  When Mrs  Jewkes  came up to me again she found me bathed in Tears She seemed as I thought to be moved to some Compassion and finding myself now intirely in her Power and that it is not for me to provoke her I said It is now I see in vain for me to contend against my evil Destiny and the superior Arts of my barbarous Master I will resign myself to the Divine Will and prepare to expect the worst But you see how this poor Mr  Williams  is drawn in and undone I am sorry I am made the Cause of  his  RuinPoor poor Manto be taken in thus and for my Sake tooBut if you'll believe me said I I gave no Encouragement to what he proposed as to Marriage nor would he have proposed it I believe but as the only honourable way he thought was left to save me And his principal Motive to it all was Virtue and Compassion to one in Distress What other View could he have You know I am poor and friendless All I beg of you is to let the poor Gentleman have Notice of my Master's Resentment and let him flee the Country and not be thrown into Goal This will answer my Master's End as well for it will as effectually hinder him from assisting me as if he was in a Prison  Ask me said she to do any thing that is in my Power consistent with my Duty and Trust and I will do it for I am sorry for you both But to be sure I shall keep no Correspondence with him nor let you I offer'd to talk of a Duty superior to that she mention'd of which would oblige her to help distressed Innocence and not permit her to go the Lengths injoin'd by lawless Tyranny but she plainly bid me be silent on that Head for it was in vain to attempt to persuade her to betray her Trust All I have to advise you said she is to be easy lay aside all your Contrivances and Arts to get away and make me your Friend by giving me no Reason to suspect you for said she I glory in my Fidelity to my Master And you have both practised some strange sly Arts to make such a Progress as he has own'd there was between you so seldom as I thought you saw one another and I must be more circumspect than I have been  This doubled my Concern for I now apprehended I should be much closer watch'd than before  Well said I since I have by this strange Accident discover'd my hard Destiny let me read over again that fearful Letter of yours that I may get it by heart and feed my Distress upon it for now I have nothing else to think of and must familiarize myself to Calamity Then said she let me read yours again I gave her mine and she lent me hers and so I took a Copy of it with her Leave because as I said I would by it prepare myself for the worst And when I had done I pinn'd it on the Head of the Couch This said I is the Use I shall make of this wretched Copy of your Letter and here you shall always find it wet with my Tears  She said She would go down to order Supper and insisted upon my Company to it I would have excused myself but she begun to put on a commanding Air that I durst not oppose And when I went down she took me by the Hand and presented me to the most hideous Monster I ever saw in my Life Here Monsieur  Colbrand  said she here is  your  pretty Ward and  mine  let us try to make her Time with us easy He bow'd and put on his foreign Grimaces and seem'd to bless himself and in broken  English  told me I was happy in de Affections of de vinest Gentleman in de Varld I was quite frighten'd and ready to drop down and I will describe him to you my dear Father and Mother if now you will ever see this and you shall judge if I had not Reason especially not knowing he was to be there and being appriz'd as I was of his hated Employment to watch me closer  He is a Giant of a Man for Stature taller by a good deal than  Harry Mawlidge  in your Neighbourhood and largebon'd and scraggy and has a HandI never saw such an one in my Life He has great staring Eyes like the Bull's that frighten'd me so Vast Jawbones sticking out Eyebrows  hanging over his Eyes two great Scars upon his Forehead and one on his left Cheek and two huge Whiskers and a monstrous wide Mouth blubber Lips long yellow Teeth and a hideous Grin He wears his own frightful long Hair ty'd up in a great black Bag a black Crape Neckloth about a long ugly Neck and his Throat sticking out like a Wen As to the rest he was drest well enough and had a Sword on with a nasty red Knot to it Leather Garters buckled below his Knees and a Foot near as long as my Arm I verily think  He said he fright de Lady and offer'd to withdraw but she bid him not and I told Mrs  Jewkes  That as she knew I had been crying she should not have called me to the Gentleman without letting me know he was there I soon went up to my Closet for my Heart aked all the time I was at Table not being able to look upon him without Horror and this Brute of a Woman tho' she saw my Distress  before  this Addition to it no doubt did it on purpose to strike me more in Terror And indeed it had its Effect for when I went tobed I could think of nothing but his hideous Person and my Master's more hideous Actions and thought them too well pair'd and when I dropt asleep I dream'd they were both coming to my Bedside with the worst Designs and I jump'd out of Bed in my Sleep and frighted Mrs  Jewkes  till waking with the Terror I told her my Dream And the wicked Creature only laughed and said All I fear'd was but a Dream as well as that and when it was over and I was well awake I should laugh at it as such  And now I am come to the Close of  WEDNESDAY  the    th Day of my Distress  POOR Mr  Williams  is actually arrested and carried away to  Stamford  So there is an End of all my Hopes in him Poor Gentleman his Oversecurity and Openness have ruin'd us both I was but too well convinced that we ought not to have lost a Moment's time but he was half angry and thought me too impatient and then his fatal Confessions and the detestable Artifice of my MasterBut one might well think that he who had so cunningly and so wickedly contrived all his Stratagems hitherto that it was impossible to avoid them would stick at nothing to complete them I fear I shall soon find it so  But one Stratagem I have just invented tho' a very discouraging one to think of because I have neither Friends nor Money nor know one Step of the Way if I was out of the House But let Bulls and Bears and Lions and Tygers and what is worse false treacherous deceitful Men stand in my Way I cannot be in more Danger than I am and I depend nothing upon his three Weeks For how do I know now be is in such a Passion and has already begun his Vengeance on poor Mr  Williams  that he will not change his Mind and come down to  Lincolnshire  before he goes to  London  My Stratagem is this I will endeavour to get Mrs  Jewkes  to go tobed without me as she often does while I sit lock'd up in my Closet and as she sleeps very sound in her first Sleep of which she never fails to give Notice by snoring if I can but then get out between the two Ears of the Window for you know I am very slender and I find I can get my Head thro' then I can drop upon the Leads underneath  which are little more than my Height and which Leads are over a little Summerparlour that juts out towards the Garden and as I am light I can easily drop from them for they are not high from the Ground Then I shall get into the Garden and then as I have the Key of the Backdoor I will get out But I have another Piece of Cunning still good Heaven succeed to me my dangerous but innocent Devices I have read of a great Captain who being in Danger leap'd overboard into the Sea and his Enemies shooting at him with Bows and Arrows he got off his upper Garment and swam away while they stuck that full of their Darts and Arrows and he escaped and triumphed over them all So what will I do but strip off my upper Petticoat and throw it into the Pond with my Neckhandkerchief for to be sure when they miss me they will go to the Pond first thinking I have drowned myself and so when they see some of my Cloaths floating there they will be all employ'd in dragging the Pond which is a very large one and as I shall not perhaps be miss'd till the Morning this will give me Opportunity to get a great way off and I am sure I will run for it when I am out And so I trust that Providence will direct my Steps to some good Place of Safety and make  some  worthy Body my Friend for sure if I suffer ever so I cannot be in more Danger nor in worse Hands than where I am and with such avow'd bad Designs  O my dear Parents don't be frighted when you come to read thisBut all will be over before you can see it and so God direct me for the best My Writings for fear I should not escape I will bury in the Garden for to be sure I shall be search'd and used dreadfully if I can't get off And  so I will close here for the present to prepare for my Plot Prosper thou O gracious Protector of oppressed Innocence this last Effort of thy poor Handmaid that I may escape the crafty Devices and Snares that have begun to entangle my Virtue and from which but by this one Trial I see no way of escaping And Oh whatever becomes of me bless my dear Parents and protect poor Mr  Williams  from Ruin for he was happy before he knew me  Just now just now I heard Mrs  Jewkes  who is in her Cups own to the horrid  Colbrand  that the robbing of poor Mr  Williams  was a Contrivance of hers and executed by the Groom and a Helper in order to seize my Letters upon him which they miss'd They are now both laughing at the dismal Story which they little think I heard O how my Heart akes for what are not such Wretches capable of Can you blame me for endeavouring thro' any Danger to get out of such Clutches  Past Eleven o'Clock  MRS  Jewkes  is come up and gone tobed and bids me not stay long in my Closet but come tobed O for a dead Sleep for the treacherous Brute I never saw her so tipsy and that gives me Hopes I have try'd again and find I can get my Head thro' the Iron Bars I am now all prepared as soon as I hear her fast and now I'll seal up these and my other Papers my last Work And to thy Providence O my gracious God commit the restOnce more God bless you both and send us a happy Meeting if not here in his heavenly Kingdom  Amen  THURSDAY FRIDAY SATURDAY SUNDAY the    th    th    th and    st Days of my Distress  AND Distress indeed For here I am still And every thing has been worse and worse Oh the poor unhappy  Pamela  Without any Hope left and ruin'd in all my Contrivances But Oh my dear Parents rejoice with me even in this low Plunge of my Distress for your poor  Pamela  has escap'd from an Enemy worse than any she ever met with an Enemy she never thought of before and was hardly able to stand against I mean the Weakness and Presumption both in one of her own Mind which had well nigh had not divine Grace interposed sunk her into the lowest last Abyss of Misery and Perdition  I will proceed as I have Opportunity with my sad Relation For my Pen and Ink in my now doublysecur'd Closet is all that I have besides my own Weakness of Body to employ myself with And till yesterday Evening I have not been able to hold a Pen  I took with me but one Shift besides what I had on and two Handkerchiefs and two Caps which my Pocket held for it was not for me to incumber myself and all my Stock of Money which was but five or six Shillings to set out for I knew not where and got out of the Window not without some Difficulty sticking a little at my Shoulders and Hips but I was resolv'd to get out if possible And it was further from the Leads than I thought and I was afraid I had sprain'd my Ancle and when I had dropt from the Leads to the Ground it was still further off but I did pretty well there at least I got no Hurt to hinder me from pursuing my Intentions  So being now on the Ground I hid my Papers under a Rosebush and cover'd them over with Mould and there they still lie as I hope Then I hy'd away to the Pond The Clock struck Twelve just as I got out and it was a dark misty Night and coldish but I felt none then  When I came to the Pondside I flung in my Uppercoat as I had design'd and my Neckhandkerchief and a round ear'd Cap with a Knot and then with great Speed ran to the Door and took the Key out of my Pocket my poor Heart beating all the Time against my Bosom as if it would have forc'd its way thro' it And beat it well might For I then too late found that I was most miserably disappointed for the wicked Woman had taken off that Lock and put another on so that my Key would not open it I try'd and try'd and feeling about I found a Padlock besides on another Part of the Door O then how my Heart sunkI dropt down with Grief and Confusion unable to stir or support myself for a while But my Fears awakening my Resolution and knowing that my Attempt would be as terrible for me as any other Danger I could then encounter I clamber'd up upon the Ledges of the Door and upon the Lock which was a great wooden one and reached the Top of the Door with my Hands then little thinking I could climb so well I made shift to lay hold on the Top of the Wall with my Hands but alas for me nothing but ill Luck no Escape for poor  Pamela  The Wall being old the Bricks I held by gave way just as I was taking a Spring to get up and down came I and received such a Blow upon my Head with one of the Bricks that it quite stunn'd me and I broke my Shins and m  Ancle besides and beat off the Heel of one of my Shoes  In this dreadful way flat upon the Ground lay poor I for I believe five or six Minutes and when I would have got up I could hardly stand for I found I had bruis'd my left Hip and Shoulder and was full of Pain with it and besides my Head bled and ak'd with the Blow I had with the BrickYet this I valued not but crawl'd a good way upon my Feet and Hands in Search of a Ladder I just recollected to have seen against the Wall two Days before on which the Gardner was nailing a Nectarine Branch that was blown off from the Wall But no Ladder could I find and the Wall was very high What now thinks I must become of the miserable  Pamela  Then I began to wish myself most heartily again in my Closet and to repent of my Attempt which I now censur'd as rash because it did not succeed  God forgive me but a sad Thought came just then into my HeadI tremble to think of it Indeed my Apprehensions of the Usage I should meet with had like to have made me miserable for ever O my dear dear Parents forgive your poor Child but being then quite desperate I crept along till I could get up on my Feet tho' I could hardly stand and away limp'd IWhat to do but to throw myself into the Pond and so put a Period to all my Griefs in this WorldBut Oh to find them infinitely aggravated had I not by the Divine Grace been withheld in a miserable  Eternity  As I have escap'd this Temptation blessed be God for it I will tell you my Conflicts on this dreadful Occasion that the Divine Mercies may be magnify'd in my Deliverance that I am yet on this Side the dreadful Gulph from which there can be no Redemption  It was well for me as I have since thought that I was so maim'd as made me the longer before I got to the Water for this gave me some Reflection and abated that Impetuousness of my Passions which possibly might otherwise have hurry'd me in my first Transport of Grief on my seeing no way to escape and the hard Usage I had Reason to expect from my dreadful Keepers to throw myself in without Consideration but my Weakness of Body made me move so slowly that it gave Time for a little Reflection a Ray of Grace to dart in upon my benighted Mind and so when I came to the Pondside I sat myself down on the sloping Bank and began to ponder my wretched Condition And thus I reason'd with myself  Pause here a little  Pamela  on what thou art about before thou takest the dreadful Leap and consider whether there be no Way yet left no Hope if not to escape from this wicked House yet from the Mischiefs threaten'd thee in it  I then consider'd and after I had cast about in my Mind every thing that could make me hope and saw no Probability a wicked Woman devoid of all Compassion a horrid Helper just arriv'd in this dreadful  Colbrand  an angry and resenting Master who now hated me and threaten'd the most afflicting Evils and that I should in all Probability be depriv'd even of the Opportunity I now had before me to free myself from all their Persecutions What hast thou to do distressed Creature said I to myself but throw thyself upon a merciful God who knows how innocently I suffer to avoid the merciless Wickedness of those who are determin'd on my Ruin  And then thought I and Oh that Thought was surely of the Devil's Instigation for it was very soothing and powerful with me these wicked Wretches  who now have no Remorse no Pity on me will then be mov'd to lament their Misdoings and when they see the dead Corpse of the unhappy  Pamela  dragg'd out to these slopy Banks and lying breathless at their Feet they will find that Remorse to wring their obdurate Hearts which now has no Place there And my Master my angry Master will then forget his Resentments and say O this is the unhappy  Pamela  that I have so causelesly persecuted and destroy'd Now do I see she preferr'd her Honesty to her Life will he say and is no Hypocrite nor Deceiver but really was the innocent Creature she pretended to be Then thinks I will he perhaps shed a few Tears over the poor Corse of his persecuted Servant and tho' he may give out it was Love and Disappointment and that too in order to hide his own Guilt for the unfortunate Mr  Williams  perhaps yet will he be inwardly griev'd and order me a decent Funeral and save me or rather  this Part  of me from the dreadful Stake and the Highway Interrment and the young Men and Maidens all around my dear Father's will pity poor  Pamela  But O I hope I shall not be the Subject of their Ballads and Elegies but that my Memory for the sake of my dear Father and Mother may quickly slide into Oblivion  I was once rising so indulgent was I to this sad way of thinking to throw myself in But again my Bruises made me slow and I thought What art thou about to do wretched  Pamela  how knowest thou tho' the Prospect be all dark to thy shortsighted Eye what God may do for thee even when all human Means fail God Almighty would not lay me under these sore Afflictions if he had not given me Strength to grapple with them if I will exert it as I ought And who knows but that the very Presence I so much dread of my angry and designing Master  for he has had me in his Power before and yet I have escaped may be better for me than these persecuting Emissaries of his who for his Money are true to their wicked Trust and are harden'd by that and a long Habit of Wickedness against Compunction of Heart God  can  touch his Heart in an Instant and if this should  not  be done I can  then  but put an End to my Life by some other Means if I am so resolved  But how do I know thought I that even  these Bruises  and  Maims  that I have gotten while I pursu'd only the laudable Escape I had meditated may not kindly furnish me with the Opportunity I now am tempted to precipitate myself upon and of surrendering up my Life spotless and unguilty to that merciful Being who gave it  Then thought I who gave thee presumptuous as thou art a Power over thy Life Who authoriz'd thee to put an End to it when the Weakness of thy Mind suggests not to thee a Way to preserve it with Honour How knowest thou what Purposes God may have to serve by the Trials with which thou art now tempted Art  thou  to put a Bound to the Divine Will and to say Thus much will I bear and no more And wilt thou  dare  to say that if the Trial be augmented and continued thou wilt sooner die than bear it  This Act of Despondency thought I is a Sin that if I pursue it admits of no Repentance and can therefore claim no ForgivenessAnd wilt thou for shortening thy transitory Griefs  heavy  as they are and  weak  as thou fanciest thyself plunge both Body and Soul into everlasting Misery Hitherto  Pamela  thought I thou art the innocent the suffering  Pamela  and wilt thou be the guilty Aggressor and because wicked Men persecute thee wilt thou fly in the Face of the Almighty and bid Defiance to his Grace  and Goodness who can  still  turn all these Sufferings to Benefits And how do I know but that God who sees all the lurking Vileness of my Heart may have permitted these Sufferings on that very Score and to make me rely solely on his Grace and Assistance who perhaps have too much prided myself in a vain Dependance on my own foolish Contrivances  Then again thought I wilt thou suffer in  one  Moment all the good Lessons of thy poor honest Parents and the Benefit of their Example who have persisted in doing  their  Duty with Resignation to the Divine Will amidst the extremest Degrees of Disappointment Poverty and Distress and the Persecutions of an ingrateful World and merciless Creditors to be thrown away upon thee and bring down as in all Probability this thy Rashness will their grey Hairs with Sorrow to the Grave when they shall understand that their beloved Daughter slighting the Tenders of Divine Grace desponding in the Mercies of a gracious God has blemish'd in this  last Act  a  whole  Life which they had hitherto approv'd and delighted in  What then presumptuous  Pamela  dost thou  here  thought I Quit with Speed these guilty Banks and flee from these dashing Waters that even in their sounding Murmurs this still Night reproach thy Rashness Tempt not God's Goodness on the mossy Banks that have been Witnesses of thy guilty Intentions and while thou hast Power left thee avoid the tempting Evil lest thy grand Enemy now repuls'd by Divine Grace and due Reflection return to the Charge with a Force that thy Weakness may not be able to resist And lest one rash Moment destroy all the Convictions which now have aw'd thy rebellious Mind into Duty and Resignation to the Divine Will  And so saying I arose but was so stiff with my Hurts so cold with the moist Dew of the Night and the wet Banks on which I had sat as also the Damps arising from so large a Piece of Water that with great Pain I got from the Banks of this Pond which now I think of with Terror and bending my limping Steps towards the House refug'd myself in the Corner of an Outhouse where Wood and Coals are laid up for Family Use till I should be found by my cruel Keepers and consign'd to a wretched Confinement and worse Usage than I had hitherto experienc'd and there behind a Pile of Firewood I crept and lay down as you may imagine with a Mind just broken and a Heart sensible to nothing but the extremest Woe and Dejection  This my dear Father and Mother is the Issue of your poor  Pamela  's fruitless Enterprize and who knows if I had got out at the Backdoor whether I had been at all in better Case moneyless friendless as I am and in a strange PlaceBut blame not your poor Daughter too much Nay if ever you see this miserable Scribble all bathed and blotted with my Tears let your Pity get the better of your Blame But I know it willAnd I must leave off for the presentFor Oh my Strength and my Will are at this time very far unequal to one anotherBut yet I will add that tho' I should have prais'd God for my Deliverance had I been freed from my wicked Keepers and my designing Master yet I have more abundant Reason for Praise that I have been deliver'd from a worse Enemy  myself  I will continue my sad Relation  It seems Mrs  Jewkes  awaked not till Daybreak and not finding me in Bed she call'd me and no  Answer being return'd she relates that she got out of Bed and run to my Closet and not finding me searched under the Bed and in another Closet finding the Chamberdoor as she had left it quite fast and the Key as usual about her Wrist For if I could have got out at the Chamberdoor there were two or three Passages and Doors to them all double lock'd and barr'd to go thro' into the great Garden so that to escape there was no Way but that of the Window and that very Window because of the Summerparlour under it for the other Windows are a great way from the Ground  She says she was excessively frighted and instantly rais'd the  Swiss  and the two Maids who lay not far off and finding every Door fast she said I must be carry'd away as St  Peter  was out of Prison by some Angel It is a Wonder she had not a worse Thought  She says she wept and wrung her Hands and took on sadly running about like a mad Woman little thinking I could have got out of the Closet Window between the Iron Bars and indeed I don't know if I could do so again But at last finding that Casement open they concluded it must be so and so they ran out into the Garden and found my Footsteps in the Mould of the Bed which I dropt down upon from the Leads And so speeded away all of them that is to say Mrs  Jewkes Colbrand  and  Nan  towards the Backdoor to see if that was fast while the Cook was sent to the Outoffices to raise the Men and make them get Horses ready to take each a several Way to pursue me  But it seems finding that Door doublelock'd and padlock'd and the Heel of my Shoe and the broken Bricks they verily concluded I was got away by some Means over the Wall and then they say Mrs  Jewkes  seem'd like a distracted Woman  Till at last  Nan  had the Thought to go towards the Pond and there seeing my Coat and Cap and Handkerchief in the Water cast almost to the Banks by the dashing of the Waves she thought it was me and screaming out run to Mrs  Jewkes  and said O Madam Madam here's a piteous Thing Mrs  Pamela  lies drown'd in the PondThither they all ran and finding my Cloaths doubted not I was at the Bottom and they all  Swiss  among the rest beat their Breasts and made most dismal Lamentations and Mrs  Jewkes  sent  Nan  to the Men to bid them get the Dragnet ready and leave the Horses and come to try to find the poor Innocent as she it seems  then  call'd me beating her Breast and lamenting my hard Hap but most what would become of them and what Account they should give to my Master  While every one was thus differently employ'd some weeping and wailing some running here and there  Nan  came into the Woodhouse and there lay poor I so weak so low and dejected and withal so stiff with my Bruises that I could not stir nor help myself to get upon my Feet And I said with a low Voice for I could hardly speak Mrs  Ann  Mrs  Ann  The Creature was sadly frighted but was taking up a Billet to knock me on the Head believing I was some Thief as she said but I cry'd out O Mrs  Ann  Mrs  Ann  help me for Pity's sake to Mrs  Jewkes  for I cannot get upBless me said she what you MadamWhy our Hearts are almost broke and we were going to drag the Pond for you believing you had drown'd yourself Now said she you'll make us all alive again  And without helping me she run away to the Pond and brought all the Crew to the Woodhouse The wicked Woman as she entered said Where is she Plague of her Spells and her Witchcrafts  She shall dearly repent of this Trick if my Name be  Jewkes  and coming to me took hold of my Arm so roughly and gave me such a Pull as made me squeal out my Shoulder being bruis'd on that Side and drew me on my Face O cruel Creature said I if you knew what I have suffer'd it would move you to pity me  Even  Colbrand  seem'd to be concern'd and said Fie Madam fie you see she is almost dead You must not be so rough with her The Coachman  Robin  seem'd to be sorry for me too and said with Sobs What a Scene is here Don't you see she is all bloody in her Head and cannot stir Curse of her Contrivances said the horrid Creature she has frighted  me  out of my Wits I'm sure How the DI came you hereO said I ask me now no Questions but let the Maids carry me up to my Prison and there let me die decently and in Peace For indeed I thought I could not live two Hours  The still more inhuman Tygress said I suppose you want Mr  Williams  to pray by you don't you Well I'll send for my Master this Minute let him come and watch you himself for me for there's no such thing as holding you I'm sure  So the Maids took me up between them and carry'd me to my Chamber and when the Wretch saw how bad I was she began a little to relentwhile every one wonder'd at what I had neither Strength nor Inclination to tell them how all this came to pass which they imputed to Sorcery and Witchcraft  I was so weak when I had got up Stairs that I fainted away with Dejection Pain and Fatigue and they undress'd me and got me to Bed and Mrs  Jewkes  order'd  Nan  to bathe my Shoulder and Arm and Ancle with some old Rum warm'd and they cut the Hair a little from the back Part of my Head and wash'd that for it was clotted with Blood from  a pretty long but not deep Gash and put a Family Plaister upon it for if this Woman has any good Quality it is it seems in a Readiness and Skill to manage in Cases where sudden Misfortunes happen in a Family  After this I fell into a pretty sound and refreshing Sleep and lay till Twelve o'Clock tolerably easy considering I was very feverish and aguishly inclin'd and she took a deal of Care to fit me to undergo more Trials which I had hop'd would have been more happily ended But Providence did not see fit  She would make me rise about Twelve but I was so weak I could only fit up till the Bed was made and went into it again and was as they said delirious some Part of the Afternoon But having a tolerable Night on  Thursday  I was a good deal better on  Friday  and on  Saturday  got up and eat a little Spoonmeat and my Feverishness seem'd to be gone and I was so mended by Evening that I begg'd her Indulgence in my Closet to be left to myself which she consented to it being doublebarr'd the Day before and I assuring her that all my Contrivances as she call'd them were at an End But first she made me tell her the whole Story of my Enterprize which I did very faithfully knowing now that nothing could stand me in any stead or contribute to my Safety and Escape And she seem'd full of Wonder at my Resolution and Venturesomeness but told me frankly that I should have found a hard Matter to get quite off for that she was provided with a Warrant from my Master who is a Justice of Peace in this County as well as the other to get me apprehended if I  had  got away on Suspicion of wronging him let me have been where I would  O how deeplaid are the Mischiefs designed to fall on my devoted HeadSurely surely I cannot be  worthy of all this ContrivanceThis too well shews me the Truth of what was hinted to me formerly at the other House that my Master swore he would  have  me O preserve me Heaven from being  his  in his own wicked Sense of the Adjuration  I must add that now this Woman sees me pick up so fast she uses me worse and has abridg'd me of Paper all but one Sheet which I am to shew her written or unwritten on Demand and has reduc'd me to one Pen yet my hidden Stores stand me in stead But she is more and more snappish and cross and tauntingly calls me Mrs  Williams  and any thing that she thinks will vex me  SUNDAY Afternoon  MRS  Jewkes  has thought fit to give me an Airing for three or four Hours this Afternoon and I am a good deal better and should be much more so if I knew for what I am reserv'd But Health is a Blessing hardly to be coveted in my Circumstances since that fits me for the Calamity I am in continual Apprehensions of whereas a weak and sickly State might possibly move Compassion for me O how I dread the coming of this angry and incensed Master tho' I am sure I have done him no Harm  Just now we heard that he had like to have been drown'd in crossing a Stream a few Days ago in pursuing his Game What is the Matter with all his ill Usage of me that I cannot hate him To be sure I am not like other People He has certainly done enough to make me hate him but yet when I heard his Danger which was very great I could not in my Heart forbear rejoicing for his Safety tho' his Death would have ended my Afflictions Ungenerous Master if you knew this you surely would not be so much my Persecutor But for my  late good Lady's sake I must wish him well and O what an Angel would he be in my Eyes yet if he would cease his Attempts and reform  Well I hear by Mrs  Jewkes  that  John Arnold  is turn'd away being detected in writing to Mr  Williams  and that Mr  Longman  and Mr  Jonathan  the Butler have incurr'd his Displeasure for offering to speak in my Behalf Mrs  Jervis  too is in Danger for all these three belike went together to beg in my Favour for now it is known where I am  Mrs  Jewkes  has with the News about my Master receiv'd a Letter but she says the Contents are too bad for me to know They must be bad indeed if they be worse than what I have already known  Just now the horrid Creature tells me as a Secret that she has reason to think he has found out a Way to satisfy my Scruples It is by marrying me to this dreadful  Colbrand  and buying me of him on the Weddingday for a Sum of MoneyWas ever the like heardShe says it will be my Duty to obey my Husband and that Mr  Williams  will be forc'd as a Punishment to marry us and that when my Master has paid for me and I am surrender'd up the  Swiss  is to go home again with the Money to his former Wife and Children for she says it is the Custom of those People to have a Wife in every Nation  But this to be sure is horrid romancing But abominable as it is it may possibly serve to introduce some Plot now hatchingWith what strange Perplexities is my poor Mind agitated Perchance some Shammarriage may be design'd on purpose to ruin me But can a Husband sell his Wife against her own Consent And will such a Bargain stand good in Law  MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY the    d    d and    th Days of my Imprisonment  NOTHING offers these Days but Squabblings between Mrs  Jewkes  and me She grows worse and worse to me I vexed her Yesterday because she talked nastily and told her she talk'd more like a vile  London  Prostitute than a Gentleman's Housekeeper and she cannot use me bad enough for it Bless me she curses and storms at me like a Trooper and can hardly keep her Hands off me You may believe she must talk sadly to make me say such harsh Words Indeed it cannot be repeated and she is a Disgrace to her Sex And then she ridicules me and laughs at my Notions of Honesty and tells me impudent Creature that she is what a fine Bedfellow I shall make for my Master and suchlike with such whimsical Notions about me Do you think this is to be borne And yet she talks worse than this if possibleQuite filthily O what vile Hands am I put into  THURSDAY  I Have now all the Reason that can be to apprehend my Master will be here soon for the Servants are busy in setting the House to rights and a Stable and Coachhouse are cleaning out that have not been used some time I ask Mrs  Jewkes  but she tells me nothing nor will hardly answer me when I ask her a Question Sometimes I think she puts on these strange wicked Airs to me purposely to make me wish for what I dread most of all Things my Master's coming down  He  talk of LoveIf he had any the least Notion of Regard for me to be sure he would not give this naughty  Body such Power over meAnd if he  does  come where is his Promise of not seeing me without I consent to it But it seems  His Honour owes me nothing  So he tells me in his Letter Andwhy Because I am willing to keep mine But indeed he says  he hates me perfectly  and it is plain he does or I should not be left to the Mercy of this Woman and what is worse to my woful Apprehensions  FRIDAY the    th Day of my Imprisonment  I Took the Liberty yesterday Afternoon finding the Gates open to walk out before the House and ere I was aware had got to the Bottom of the long Row of Elms and there I sat myself down upon the Steps of a sort of broad Stile which leads into the Road that goes towards the Town And as I sat musing about what always busies my Mind I saw a whole Body of Folks running towards me from the House Men and Women as in a Fright At first I wonder'd what was the Matter till they came nearer and I found they were all alarm'd thinking I had attempted to get off There was first the horrible  Colbrand  running with his long Legs well nigh two Yards at a Stride then there was one of the Grooms poor Mr  Williams  's Robber then I spy'd  Nan  half out of Breath and the Cookmaid after her and lastly came waddling as fast as she could Mrs  Jewkes  exclaiming most bitterly as I found against me  Colbrand  said O how have you frighted us allAnd went behind me lest I should run away as I suppose  I sat still to let them see I had no View to get away for besides the Improbability of succeeding my last sad Attempt had cur'd me of enterprizing again And when Mrs  Jewkes  came within hearing  I found her terribly incens'd and raving about my Contrivances Why said I should you be so concerned Here I have sat a few Minutes and had not the least Thought of getting away or going further but to return as soon as it was duskish She would not believe me and the barbarous Creature struck at me with her horrid Fist and I believe would have felled me had not  Colbrand  interposed and said He saw me sitting still looking about me and not seeming to have the least Inclination to stir But this would not serve She order'd the two Maids to take me each by an Arm and lead me back into the House and up Stairs and there have I been lock'd up ever since without Shoes In vain have I pleaded that I had no Design as indeed I had not the least and last Night I was forced to lie between her and  Nan  and I find she is resolved to make a Handle of this against me and in her own BehalfIndeed what with her Usage and my own Apprehensions of still worse I am quite weary of my Life  Just now she has been with me and given me my Shoes and has laid her imperious Commands upon me to dress myself in a Suit of Cloaths out of the Portmanteau which I have not seen lately against three or four o'Clock for she says she is to have a Visit from Lady  Darnford  's two Daughters who came purposely to see me and so she gave me the Key of the Portmanteau But I will not obey her and I told her I would not be made a Shew of nor see the Ladies She left me saying It should be worse for me if I did not But how can that be  Five o' Clock is come  AND no young LadiesSo that I fansy But hold I hear their Coach I believe I'll step to the WindowI won't go down to them I am resolv'd  Good Sirs good Sirs What will become of me Here is my Master come in his fine ChariotIndeed he is What shall I do Where shall I hide myselfOh what shall I doPray for me But Oh you'll not see thisNow good God of Heaven preserve me if it be thy blessed Will  Seven o'Clock  THO' I dread to see him yet do I wonder I have not To be sure something is resolving against me and he stays to hear all her Stories I can hardly write yet as I can do nothing else I know not how to forbearYet I cannot hold my Pen How crooked and trembling the LinesI must leave off till I can get quieter FingersWhy should the Guiltless tremble so when the Guilty can possess their Minds in Peace  SATURDAY Morning  NOW let me give you an Account of what passed last Night for I had no Power to write nor yet Opportunity till now  This vile Woman held my Master till half an Hour after Seven and he came hither about Five in the Afternoon And then I heard his Voice on the Stairs as he was coming up to me It was about his Supper for he said I shall chuse a boil'd Chicken with Butter and ParsleyAnd up he came  He put on a stern and majestick Air and he can look very majestick when he pleases Well perverse  Pamela  ungrateful Runaway said he for my first SalutationYou do well don't you to give me all this Trouble and Vexation I could not speak but throwing my self on the Floor hid my Face and was ready to die with Grief and Apprehension He said Well may you hide your Face well may you be ashamed to see me vile forward one as you areI sobb'd and wept but could not speak And he let me lie and went to the Door and called Mrs  Jewkes  There said he take up that fallen AngelOnce I thought her as innocent as an Angel of Light But I have now no Patience with her The little Hypocrite prostrates her self thus in hopes to move my Weakness in her Favour and that I'll raise her from the Floor myself But I shall not touch her No said he cruel Gentleman as he was let such Fellows as  Williams  be taken in by her artful Wiles I know her now and see she is for any Fool's Turn that will be caught by her  I sighed as if my Heart would breakAnd Mrs  Jewkes  lifted me up upon my Knees for I trembled so I could not stand Come said she Mrs  Pamela  learn to know your best Friend confess your unworthy Behaviour and beg his Honour's Forgiveness of all Your Faults I was ready to saint and he said She is Mistress of Arts I'll assure you and will mimick a Fit ten to one in a Minute  I was struck to the Heart at this but could not speak presently only lifted up my Eyes to Heaven And at last made shift to sayGod forgive you SirHe seem'd in a great Passion and walked up and down the Room casting sometimes an Eye upon me and seem  ng as if he would have spoken but check'd himself And at last he said When she has  acted  this her  first Part  over perhaps I will see  her again and she shall  soon  know what she has to trust to  And so he went out of the Room And I was quite sick at HeartSurely said I I am the wickedest Creature that ever breath'd Well said the Impertinent not so wicked as  that  neither but I am glad you begin to see your Faults Nothing like being humbleCome I'll stand your Friend and plead for you if you'll promise to be more dutiful for the future Come come added the Wretch this may be all made up by tomorrow Morning if you are not a FoolBegone hideous Woman said I and let not my Afflictions be added to by thy inexorable Cruelty and unwomanly Wickedness  She gave me a Push and went away in a violent Passion And it seems she made a Story of this and said I had such a Spirit there was no hearing it  I laid me down on the Floor and had no Power to stir till the Clock struck Nine and then the wicked Woman came up again You must come down Stairs said she to my Master that is if you please SpiritSaid I I believe I cannot stand Then said she I'll send Monsieur  Colbrand  to carry you down  I got up as well as I could and trembled all the way down Stairs And she went before me into the Parlour and a new Servant that he had waiting on him instead of  John  withdrew as soon as I came in And by the way he had a new Coachman too which looked as if  Bedfordshire Robin  was turn'd away  I thought said he when I came down you should have sat at Table with we when I had not Company but when I find you cannot forget you Original but must prefer my Menials to me I call you down to wait on me while I sup that I may have some Talk with you and throw away as little Time as possible upon you  Sir said I you do me Honour to wait upon you And I never shall I hope forget my Original But I was forced to stand behind his Chair that I might hold by it Fill me said he a Glass of that  Burgundy  I went to do it but my Hand shook so that I could not hold the Plate with the Glass in it and spilt some of the Wine So Mrs  Jewkes  pour'd it for me and I carry'd it as well as I could and made a low Court'sy He took it and said Stand behind me out of my Sight  Why Mrs  Jewkes  said he you tell me she remains very sullen still and eats nothing No said she not so much as will keep Life and Soul togetherAnd is always crying you say too Yes Sir answer'd she I think she is for one thing or another Ay said he your young Wenches will feed upon their Tears and their Obstinacy will serve them for Meat and Drink I think I never saw her look better tho in my Life But I suppose she lives upon Love This sweet Mr  Williams  and her little villanous Plots together have kept her alive and well to be sure For Mischief Love and Contradiction are the natural Ailments of a Woman  Poor I was forced to hear all this and be silent and indeed my Heart was too full to speak  And so you say said he that she had  another  Project but Yesterday to get away She denies it herself said she but it had all the Appearance of one I'm sure she made me in a fearful Pucker about it And I am glad your Honour is come with all my Heart and I hope whatever be your Honour's Intention concerning her you will not be long about it for you'll find her as slippery as an Eel I'll assure you  Sir said I and clapsed his Knees with my Arms not knowing what I did and falling on my Knees  Have Mercy on me and hear me concerning that wicked Woman's Usage of me  He cruelly interrupted me and said I am satisfy'd she has done her Duty It signifies nothing what you say against Mrs  Jewkes  That you are here little Hypocrite as you are pleading your Cause before me is owing to her Care of you else you had been with the ParsonWicked Girl said he to tempt a Man to undo himself as you have done him at a Time when I was on the Point of making him happy for his Life  I arose but said with a deep Sigh I have done SirI have doneI have a strange Tribunal to plead before The poor Sheep in the Fable had such an one when it was try'd before the Vultur on the Accusation of the Wolf  So Mrs  Jewkes  said he you are the Wolf I the Vultur and this the poor innocent Lamb on her Trial before usOh you don't know how well this Innocent is read in Reflection She has Wit at Will when she has a mind to display her own romantick Innocence at the Price of other People's Characters  Well said the aggravating Creature this is nothing to what she has called me I have been a  Jezebel  a  London  Prostitute and what notBut I am contented with her ill Names now I see it is her Fashion and she can call your Honour a Vultur  Said I I had no Thought of comparing my MasterAnd was going to say on But he said Don't prate GirlNo said she it don't become you I am sure  Well said I since I must not speak I will hold my Peace But there is a righteous Judge who knows the Secrets of all Hearts and to Him I appeal  See there said he Now this meek good Creature is praying for Fire from Heaven upon us O  she can curse most heartily in the Spirit of Christian Meekness I'll assure youCome Sawcyface give me another Glass of Wine  So I did as well as I could but wept so that he said I suppose I shall have some of your Tears in my Wine  When he had supp'd he stood up and said O how happy for you it is that you can at Will thus make your speaking Eyes overflow in this manner without losing any of their Brilliancy You have been told I suppose that you are  most  beautiful in your TearsDid you ever said he to  her  who all thi  while was standing in one Corner of the Parl  ur see a more charming Creature than this Is it to be wonder'd at that I demean myself thus to take Notice of herSee said he and took the Glass with one Hand and turn'd me round with the other What a Shape what a Neck what a Hand and what a Bloom in that lovely FaceBut who can describe the Tricks and Artifices that lie lurking in her little plotting guileful Heart 'Tis no Wonder the poor Parson was infatuated with her I blame him less than I do her for who could expect such Artifice in so young a Sorceress  I went to the further part of the Room and held my Face against the Wainscot and in spite of all I could do to refrain crying sobb'd as if my Heart would break He said I am surpriz'd Mrs  Jewkes  at the Mistake of the Letters you tell me of But you see I am not afraid any body should read what I write I don't carry on private Correspondencies and reveal every Secret that comes to my Knowledge and then corrupt People to carry my Letters against their Duty and all good Conscience  Come hither Hussy said he you and I have a dreadful Reckoning to makeWhy don't you come when I bid youFie upon it Mrs  Pamela    said she what not stir when his Honour command▪ you to come to himWho knows but his Goodness will forgive you  He came to me for I had no power to stir and put his Arms about my Neck and would kiss me and said Well Mrs  Jewkes  if it were not for the Thought of this cursed Parson I believe in my Heart so great is my Weakness that I could  yet  forgive this intriguing little Slut and take her to my Bosom  O said the Sycophant yen are very good Sir very forgiving indeedBut come added the profligate Wretch I hope you will be so good as to take her to your Bosom and that by tomorrow Morning you'll bring her to a better Sense of her Duty  Could any thing in Womanhood be so vile I had no Patience But yet Grief and Indignation choaked up the Passage of my Words and I could only stammer out a passionate Exclamation to Heaven to protect my Innocence But the Word was the Subject of their Ridicule Was ever poor Creature worse beset  He said as if he had been considering whether he could forgive me or not No I cannot yet forgive her neitherShe has given me great Disturbance has brought great discredit upon me both abroad and at home has corrupted all my Servants at the other House has despised my honourable Views and Intentions to her and sought to run away with this ingrateful ParsonAnd surely I ought not to forgive all thisYet with all this wretched Grimace he kissed me again and would have put his Hand in my Bosom but I struggled and said I would  die  before I would be used thus Consider  Pamela  said he in a Threatening Tone consider where you are and don't play the Fool  If you do a more dreadful Fate awaits you than you expect But take her up Stairs Mrs  Jewkes  and I'll send a few Lines to her to consider off and let me have your Answer  Pamela  in the Morning Till then you have to resolve upon And after that your Doom is fix'dSo I went up Stairs and gave myself up to Grief and Expectation of what he would send But yet I was glad of this Night's Reprieve  He sent me however nothing at all And about Twelve o'Clock Mrs  Jewkes  and  Nan  came up as the Night before to be my Bedfellows and I would go tobed with some of my Cloaths on which they mutter'd at sadly and Mrs  Jewkes  rail'd at me particularly Indeed I would have sat up all Night for Fear if she would have let me For I had but very little Rest that Night apprehending this Woman would let my Master in She did nothing but praise him and blame me but I answer'd her as little as I could  He has Sir  Simon TellTale  alias  Darnford  to dine with him today whose Family sent to welcome him into the Country and it seems the old Knight wants to see me so I suppose I shall be sent for as  Samson  was to make Sport for him Here I am and must bear it all  Twelve o'Clock Saturday Noon  JUST now he has sent me up by Mrs  Jewkes  the following Proposals So here are the honourable Intentions all at once laid open They are my dear Parents to make me a vile kept Mistress Which I hope I shall always detest the  Thoughts of But you'll see how they are accommodated to what I should have most desir'd could I have honestly promoted it your Welfare and Happiness I have answer'd them as I'm sure you'll approve and I am prepared for the worst For tho' I fear there will be nothing omitted to ruin me and tho' my poor Strength will not be able to defend me yet I will be innocent of Crime in my Intention and in the Sight of God and to Him leave the avenging of all my Wrongs in his own good Time and Manner I shall write to you my Answer against his Articles and hope the best tho' I fear the worst But if I should come home to you ruin'd and undone and may not be able to look you in the Face yet pity and in spirit the poor  Pamela  to make her little Remnant of Life easy for long I shall not survive my Disgrace And you may be assured it shall not be my Fault if it be my Misfortune  'To Mrs PAMELA ANDREWS  'The following  ARTICLES  are proposed to your serious Consideration and let me have an Answer in Writing to them that I may take my Resolutions accordingly Only remember that I will not be trifled with and what you give for Answer will absolutely decide your Fate without Expostulation or further Trouble  This is my ANSWER  Forgive good Sir the Spirit your poor Servant is about to shew in her Answer to your  ARTICLES  Not to be warm and in earnest on such an Occasion as the present would shew a Degree of Guilt that I hope my Soul abhors I will not trifle with you nor act like a Person doubtful of her own Mind for it wants not one Moment's Consideration with me and I  therefore return the  ANSWER  following let what will be the Consequence    'I IF you can convince me that the hated Parson has had no Encouragement from you in his Addresses and that you have no Inclination for him in Preference to me then I will offer the following Proposals to you which I will punctually make good  I AS to the first Article Sir it may behove me that I may not deserve in your Opinion the opprobrious Terms of  forward  and  artful  and suchlike to declare solemnly that Mr  Williams  never had the least Encouragement from me as to what you hint and I believe his principal Motive was the apprehended Duty of his Function quite contrary to his apparent Interest to assist a Person he thought in Distress You may Sir the rather believe me when I declare that I know not the Man breathing I would wish to marry and that the only one I could honour more than another is the Gentleman who of all others seeks my everlasting Dishonour  'II I will directly make you a Present of  Guineas  for your  own Use which you may dispose of to any Purpose you please And will give it absolutely into the Hands of any Person you shall appoint to receive it and expect no Favour in Return till you are satisfy'd in the Possession of it  II As to your second Proposal let the Consequence be what it will I  reject it with all my Soul Money Sir is not my chief Good May God Almighty desert me whenever it is and whenever for the sake of that I can give up my Title to that blessed Hope which will stand me in stead at a Time when Millions of Gold will not purchase one happy Moment of Reflection on a past mispent Life  'III I will likewise directly make over to you a Purchase I lately made in  Kent  which brings in  l per Annum  clear of all Deductions This shall be made over to you in full Property for your Life and for the Lives of any Children to Perpetuity that you may happen to have And your Father shall be immediately put into Possession of it in Trust for these Purposes And the Management of it will yield a comfortable Subsistence to him and your Mother for Life and I will make up any Deficiencies  if such should happen to that clear Sum and allow him  l per Annum  besides for his Life and that of your Mother for his Care and Management of this your Estate  III Your third Proposal Sir I reject for the same Reason and am sorry you could think my poor honest Parents would enter into their Part of it and be concerned for the Management of an Estate which would be owing to the Prostitution of their poor Daughter Forgive Sir my Warmth on this Occasion but you know not the poor Man and the poor Woman my ever dear Father and Mother if you think that they would not much rather chuse to starve in a Ditch or rot in a noisome Dungeon than accept  of the Fortune of a Monarch upon such wicked Terms I dare not say all that my full Mind suggests to me on this grievous Occasion But indeed Sir you know them not nor shall the Terrors of Death in its most frightful Forms I hope thro' God's assisting Grace ever make me act unworthy of such poor honest Parents  'IV I will moreover extend my Favour to any other of your Relations that you may think worthy of it or that are valued by you  IV Your fourth Proposal I take upon me Sir to answer as the third If I have any Friends that want the Favour of the Great may they  ever  want it if they are capable of desiring it on unworthy Terms  'V I will besides order Patterns to be sent you for chusing four complete Suits of rich Cloaths that you may appear with Reputation as if you was my Wife And I will give you the two Diamond Rings and two Pair of Earrings and Diamond Necklace that were  bought by my Mother to present to Miss  Tomlins  if the Match that was proposed between her and me had been brought to Effect And I will confer upon you still  other  Gratuities as I shall find myself obliged by your good Behaviour and Affection  V Fine Cloaths Sir become not me nor have I any Ambition to wear them I have greater Pride in my Poverty and Meanness than I should have in Dress and Finery Believe me Sir I think such things less become the humbleborn  Pamela  than the Rags your good Mother raised me from  Your Rings Sir your Necklace and your Earrings will better befit Ladies of Degree than me And to lose the best Jewel my Virtue would be poorly recompenced by those you propose to give me What should I think when I looked upon my Finger or saw in the Glass those Diamonds on my Neck and in my Ears but that they were the Price of my Honesty and that I  wore  those Jewels outwardly because I had none inwardly  'VI Now  Pamela  will you see by this what a Value I set upon the Freewill of a Person  already  in my Power and who if these Proposals are not accepted shall find that I have not taken all these Pains and risqued my Reputation as I have done without resolving to gratify my Passion for you at all Adventures and if you refuse without making any Terms at all  VI I know Sir by woful Experience that I am in your Power I know all the Resistance I can make will be poor and weak and perhaps stand me in little stead I dread your  Will  to ruin me is as great as your  Power  Yet Sir will I dare to tell you that I will make no Freewill Offering of my Virtue All that I  can  do poor as it is I will do to convince you that your Offers shall have no Part in my Choice and if I cannot  escape the Violence of Man I hope by God's Grace I shall have nothing to reproach myself for not doing all in my Power to avoid my Disgrace and then I can safely appeal to the great God my only Refuge and Protector with this Consolation That my Will bore no Part in my Violation  'VII You shall be Mistress of my Person and Fortune as much as if the foolish Ceremony had passed All my Servants shall be yours and you shall chuse any two Persons to attend yourself either Male or Female without any Controul of mine and if your Conduct be such that I have Reason to be satisfied with it I know not but will not engage for this that I may after a Twelvemonth's Cohabitation marry you for if my Love increases for you as it has done for many Months past it will be  impossible for me to deny you any thing  'And now  Pamela  consider well it is in your Power to oblige me on such Terms as will make yourself and all your Friends happy But this will be over this very Day irrevocably over and you shall find all you would be thought to fear without the least Benefit arising from it to yourself  'And I beg you'll well weigh the Matter and comply with my Proposals and I will instantly set about securing to you the full Effect of them And let me if you value yourself experience a grateful Return on this Occasion and I'll forgive all that's past'  VII I have not once dared to look so high as to such a Proposal as your seventh Article contains Hence have proceeded all my little abortive Artifices to escape from the Consinement you have put me in altho' you promised to be honourable to me Your Honour well I knew would nor let you stoop to so mean and so unworthy a Slave as the poor  Pamela  All I desire is to be permitted to return to my native Meanness unviolated What have I done Sir to deserve it should be otherwise For the obtaining of this tho' I would not have  marry'd  your Chaplain yet would I have  run away  with your meanest Servant if I had thought I could have got safe to my beloved Poverty I heard you once say Sir That a certain great Commander who could live upon Lentils might well refuse the Bribes of the greatest Monarch and I hope as I can contentedly live at the meanest Rate and think not myself above the lowest Condition that I am also above making an Exchange of my Honesty for all the Riches of the  Indies  When I come to be proud and vain of gaudy Apparel and outside Finery then which I hope will never be may I rest my principal Good in such vain Trinkets and despise for them the more solid Ornaments of a good Fame and a Chastity inviolate  Give me leave to say Sir in Answer to what you hint That you may in a Twelvemonth's Time marry me on the Continuance of my good Behaviour that  this  weighs less with me if possible  than any thing else you have said For in the first Place there is an End of all Merit and all good Behaviour on my Side if I have  now  any the Moment I consent to your Proposals And I should be so far from  expecting  such an Honour that I will pronounce that I should be most  unworthy  of it What Sir would the World say were you to marry your Harlot That a Gentleman of your Rank in Life should stoop not only to the baseborn  Pamela  but to a baseborn Prostitute Little Sir as I know of the World I am not to be caught by a Bait so poorly cover'd as this  Yet after all dreadful is the Thought that I a poor weak friendless unhappy Creature am too fully in your Power But permit me Sir to pray as I now write on my bended Knees That before you resolve upon my Ruin you will weigh well the Matter Hitherto Sir tho' you have taken large Strides to this crying Sin yet are you on  this  Side the Commission of itWhen once it is done nothing can recal it And where will be your TriumphWhat Glory will the Spoils of such a weak Enemy yield you Let me but enjoy my Poverty with Honesty is all my Prayer and I will  bless  you and  pray for  you every Moment of my Life Think O think before it is yet too late what Stings what Remorse will attend your dying Hour when you come to reflect that you have ruin'd perhaps Soul and Body a wretched Creature whose only Pride was her Virtue And how pleas'd you will be on the contrary if in that tremendous Moment you shall be able to acquit yourself of this soul Crime and to plead in your own Behalf that you suffer'd the earnest Supplications of an unhappy Wretch to prevail with you to be innocent your self and let her remain soMay God Almighty whose Mercy so lately sav'd you from  the Peril of perishing in deep Waters on which I hope you will give me Cause to congratulate you touch your Heart in my Favour and save  you  from this  Sin  and me from this  Ruin  And to Him do I commit my Cause and to Him will I give the Glory and Night and Day pray for you if I may be permitted to escape this great Evil From  Your poor oppressed brokenspirited Servant  I took a Copy of this for your Perusal my dear Parents if I shall ever be so happy to see you again for I hope my Conduct will be approved of by you and at Night when Sir  Simon  was gone he sent for me down Well said he have you considered my Proposals Yes Sir said I I have And there is my Answer But pray let me not see you read it Is it your Bashfulness said he or your Obstinacy that makes you not chuse I should read it before you  I offer'd to go away and he said Don't run from me I won't read it till you are gone But said he tell me  Pamela  whether you comply with my Proposals or not Sir said I you will see presently pray don't hold me for he took my Hand Said he Did you well consider before you answer'dI did Sir said I If it be not what you think will please me said he dear Girl take it back again and reconsider it for if I have this as your absolute Answer And I don't like it you are undone for I will not sue meanly where I can command I fear said he it is not what I like by your Manner And let me tell you That I cannot bear Denial If the Terms I have offer'd are not sufficient I will augment them to two Thirds of  my Estate for said he and swore a dreadful Oath I cannot live without you And since the thing is gone so far I  will not  And so he clasped me in his Arms in such a manner as quite frighted me and kissed me two or three times  I got from him and run up Stairs and went to the Closet and was quite uneasy and fearful  In an Hour's time he called Mr  Jewkes  down to him and I heard him very high in Passion And all about poor me And I heard her say it was his own Fault there would be an End of all my Complaining and Perverseness if he was once resolved and other most impudent Aggravations I am resolved not to go to bed this Night if I can help itLie still lie still my poor fluttering Heart what will become of me  Almost Twelve o'Clock SATURDAY Night  HE sent Mrs  Jewkes  about Ten o'Clock to tell me to come to him Where said I I'll shew you said she I went down three or four Steps and saw her making to his Chamber the Door of which was open So I said I cannot go there Don't be foolish said she but come no Harm will be done to youWell said I if I die I cannot go there I heard him say Let her come or it shall be worse for her I can't bear said he to speak to her myself Well said I I cannot come indeed I cannot and so I went up again into my Closet expecting to be fetch'd by Force  But she came up soon after and bid me make haste tobed Said I I will not go tobed this Night that's certainThen said she you shall be  made  to come tobed and  Nan  and I will undress you I knew neither Prayers nor Tears would move this  wicked Woman So I said I am sure you will let my Master in and I shall be undone Mighty Piece of Undone she said But he was too exasperated against me to be so familiar with me she would assure meAy said she you'll be disposed of another way soon I can tell you for your Comfort And I hope your  Husband  will have your Obedience tho' nobody else can have it No Husband in the World said I shall make me do an unjust or base thingShe said That would be soon try'd and  Nan  coming in What said I am I to have two Bedfellows again these warm Nights Yes said she Slipperyones you are till you can have  one good one  instead of us Said I Mrs  Jewkes  don't talk nastily to me I see you are beginning again and I shall affront you maybe for next to bad Action are bad Words for they could not be spoken if they were not in the Heart Come to bed Purity said she You are a Nonsuch I suppose Indeed said I I can't come to bed and it will do you no harm to let me sit all Night in the great Chair  Nan  said she undress my young Lady If she won't let you I'll help you And if neither of us can do it quietly we'll call my Master to do it for us tho said she I think it an Office worthier of Monsieur  Colebrand  You are very wicked said I I know it said she I am a  Jezebel  and a  London  Prostitute you know You did great Feats said I to tell my Master all this poor Stuff But you did not tell him how you beat me No Lambkin said she a Word I had not heard a good while that I left for you to tell and you was going to do it if the  Vultur  had not taken the  Wolf  's Part and bid the poor innocent  Lamb  be silent Ay said I no matter for your Fleers Mrs  Jewkes  tho' I can have neither Justice nor Mercy here and cannot be heard in my Defence yet a Time will come  maybe when I  shall  be heard and when your own Guilt will strike you dumbAy Spirit said she and the  Vultur  too Must we  both  be dumb Why that Lambkin will be prettyThen said the wicked one you'll have all the Talk to your self Then how will the Tongue of the pretty Lambkin bleat out  Innocence  and  Virtue  and  Honesty  till the whole Trial be at an EndYou're a wicked Woman that's certain said I and if you thought any thing of another World could not talk thus But no WonderIt shews what Hands I am got intoAy so it does said she but I beg you'll undress and come tobed or I believe your Innocence won't keep you from  still worse  Hands I will come tobed said I if you will let me have the Keys in my own Hand not else if I can help it Yes said she and then hey for another Contrivance another EscapeNo no said I all my Contrivances are over I'll assure you Pray let me have the Keys and I will come to bed She came to me and took me in her huge Arms as if I was a Feather said she I do this to shew you what a poor Resistance you can make against me if I pleased to exert my self and so Lambkin don't say to your Wolf I  won't  come to bedAnd set me down and tapped me on the Neck Ah said she thou art a pretty Creature it's true but so obstinate so full of Spirit If thy Strength was but answerable to that thou wouldst run away with us all and this great House too on thy BackBut undress undress I tell you  Well said I I see my Misfortunes make you very merry and very witty too But I will  love  you if you will humour me with the Keys of the ChamberdoorsAre you  sure  you will love me said sheNow speak your ConscienceWhy said I you must not put it so close neither would you  if you thought you had not given Reason to doubt itBut I will love you as well as I canI would not tell a wilful Lye And if I did you would not believe me after your hard Usage of me Well said she that's all fair I ownBut  Nan  pray pull off my young Lady's Shoes and StockensNo pray don't said I I will come tobed presently since I must  And so I went to the Closet and scribbled a little about this idle Chitchat And she being importunate I was forced to go tobed but with some of my Cloaths on as the former Night and she let me hold the two Keys for there are two Locks there being a double Door and so I got a little Sleep that Night having had none for two or three Nights before  I can't imagine what she means but  Nan  offer'd to talk a little once or twice and she snubb'd her and said I charge you Wench don't open your Lips before me And if you are asked any Questions by Mrs  Pamela  don't answer her one Word while I am hereBut she is a lordly Woman to to the Maidservants and that has always been her Character O how unlike good Mrs  Jervis  in every thing  SUNDAY Morning  A Thought came into my Head I meant no Harm but it was a little bold For seeing my Master dressing to go to Church and his Chariot getting ready I went to my Closet and I writ  The Prayers of this Congregation are earnestly desired for a Gentlemen of great Worth and Honour who labours under a Temptation to exert his great Power to ruin a poor distressed worthless Maiden  And also  The Prayers of this Congregation are earnestly desired by a poor distressed Creature for the Preservation of her Virtue and Innocence  Mrs  Jewkes  came up Always writing said she and would see it And strait all that ever I could say carry'd it down to my MasterHe look'd upon it and said Tell her she shall soon see how her Prayers are answer'd She is very bold But as she has rejected all my Favours her Reckoning for all is not far off I look'd after him out of the Window and he was charmingly dress'd To be sure he is a handsome fine GentlemanWhat pity his Heart is not as good as his Appearance Why can't I hate himBut don't be uneasy if you should see this for it is impossible I should love him for his Vices all  ugly him over  as I may say  My Master sends Word that he shall not come home to Dinner I suppose he dines with this Sir  Simon Darnford  I am much concern'd for poor Mr  Williams  Mrs  Jewkes  says he is confined still and takes on much All his Trouble is brought upon him for my sake This grieves me much My Master it seems will have his Money from him This is very hard for it is three fifty Pounds he gave him as he thought as a Salary for three Years that he has been with him But there was no Agreement between them and he absolutely depended on my Master's Favour To be sure it was the more generous of him to run these Risques for the sake of oppressed Innocence and I hope he will meet with his Reward in due Time Alas for me I dare not plead for him that would raise my Oppressor's Jealousy more And I have not Interest to save myself  SUNDAY Evening  MRS  Jewkes  has received a Line from my Master I wonder what it is but his Chariot is come home without him But she will tell me nothing so it is in vain to ask her I am so fearful of Plots and Tricks I know not what to do Every thing I suspect for now my Disgrace is avow'd what can I thinkTo be sure the worst will be attempted I can only pour out my Soul in Prayer to God for his blessed Protection But if I must suffer let me not be long a mournful Survivor Only let me not shorten my own Time sinfully  This Woman left upon the Table in the Chamber this Letter of my Master's to her and I bolted myself in till I had transcrib'd it You'll see how tremblingly by the Lines I wish poor Mr  Williams  's Release at any Rate but this Letter makes my Heart ake Yet I have another Day's Reprieve thank God  '  Mrs  JEWKES  'I Have been so press'd on  Williams  's Affair that I shall set out this Afternoon in Sir  Simon  Chariot and with Parson  Peters  who is his Intercessor for  Stamford  and shall not be back till tomorrow Evening if then As to your Ward I am thoroughly incensed against her She has with stood her Time and now would she sign and seal to my Articles it is too late I shall discover something perhaps by him and will on my Return let her know that all her insnaring Loveliness shall not save her from the Fate that awaits her But let her know nothing of this lest it put her fruitful Mind upon Plots and Artifices Besure trust her not without another with you at  Night lest she venture the Window in her foolish Rashness For I shall require her at your Hands  '  Yours  c'  I had but just finished taking a Copy of this and laid the Letter where I had it and unbolted the Door when she came up in a great Fright for fear I should have seen it but I being in my Closet and that lying as she left it she did not mistrust O said she I was afraid you had seen my Master's Letter here which I carelesly lest on the Table I wish said I I had known that Why sure said she if you had you would not have offered to read my Letters Indeed said I I should at this time if it had been in my wayDo let me see itWell said she I wish poor Mr  Williams  well off I understand my Master is gone to make up Matters with him which is very good To be sure added she he is a very good Gentleman and very forgiving Why said I as If I had known nothing of the Matter how can he make up Matters with him Is not Mr  Williams  at  Stamford  Yes said she I believe so but Parson  Peters  pleads for him and he is gone with him to  Stamford  and will not be back tonight So we have nothing to do but to eat our Suppers betimes and go tobed Ay that's pure said I and I shall have good Rest this Night I hope So said she you might every Night but for your own idle Fears You are afraid of your Friends when none are near you Ay that's true said I for I have not one near me  So have I one more good honest Night before me What the next may be I know not and so I'll try to take in a good deal of Sleep while I can be a little easy Therefore here I say Goodnight my dear Parents for I have no more to write about this Night  And tho' his Letter shocks me yet I will be as bri  as I can that she mayn't suspect I have seen it  TUESDAY Night  FOR the future I will always mistrust most when Appearances look fairest O your poor Daughter what has she not suffer'd since what I wrote of  Sunday  NightMy worst Trial and my fearfullest Danger O how I shudder to write you an Account of this wicked Interval of Time For my dear Parents will you not be too much frighten'd and affected with my Distress when I tell you that his Journey to  Stamford  was all abominable Pretence for he came home privately and had well nigh effected all his vile Purposes▪ and the Ruin of your poor Daughter and that by such a Plot as I was not in the least apprehensive of And Oh you'll hear what a vile and unwomanly Part that wicked Wretch Mrs  Jewkes  acted in it  I left off with letting you know how much I was pleased that I had one Night's Reprieve added to my Honesty But I had less Occasion to rejoice than ever as you will judge by what I have said already Take then the dreadful Story as well as I can relate it  The Maid  Nan  is a little apt to drink if she can get at Liquor and Mrs  Jewkes  happen'd or design'd as is too probable to leave a Bottle of Cherrybrandy in her way and the Wench drank some of it more than she should and when she came in to lay the Cloth Mrs  Jewkes  perceiv'd it and fell a rating at her most sadly for she has too many Faults of her own to suffer any of the like sort in any body else if she can help it and she bid her get out of her Sight when we had supp'd and go tobed to sleep off her Liquor before we came tobed  And so the poor Maid went muttering up Stairs  About two Hours after which was near Eleven o'Clock Mrs  Jewkes  and I went up to go tobed I pleasing myself with what a charming Night I should have We lock'd both Doors and saw poor  Nan  as I thought for Oh 'twas my abominable Master as you shall hear byandby sitting fast asleep in an Elbowchair in a dark Corner of the Room with her Apron thrown over her Head and Neck And Mrs  Jewkes  said There is that Beast of a Wench fast asleep instead of being a bed I knew said she she had taken a fine Dose I'll wake her said I No don't said she let her sleep on we shall lie better without her Ay said I so we shall but won't she get Cold  Said she I hope you have no Writing tonight No reply'd I I will go tobed with you Mrs  Jewkes  Said she I wonder what you can find to write about so much and am sure you have better Conveniencies of that kind and more Paper than I am aware of and I had intended to romage you if my Master had not come down for I 'spy'd a broken Teacup with Ink which gave me a Suspicion but as he is come let him look after you if he will and if you deceive him it will be his own Fault  All this time we were undressing ourselves And I fetch'd a deep Sigh What do you sigh for said she I am thinking Mrs  Jewkes  answer'd I what a sad Life I live and how hard is my Lot I am sure the Thief that has robb'd is much better off than I 'bating the Guilt and I should I think take it for a Mercy to be hang'd out of the way rather than live in these cruel Apprehensions So being not sleepy and in a prattling Vein I began to give a little History of myself as I did once before to Mrs  Jervis  in this manner  Here said I were my poor honest Parents they took care to instil good Principles into my Mind till I was almost twelve Years of Age and taught me to prefer Goodness and Poverty to the highest Condition of Life and they confirm'd their Lessons by their own Practice for they were of late Years remarkably poor and always as remarkably honest even to a Proverb for  As honest as Goodman  ANDREWS was a Byeword  Well then said I comes my late dear good Lady and takes a Fancy to me and said she would be the making of me if I was a good Girl and she put me to sing to dance to play on the Spinnet in order to divert her melancholy Hours and also learnt me all manner of fine Needlework but still this was her Lesson  My good  Pamela  be virtuous and keep the Men at a Distance  Well so I was I hope and so I did and yet tho' I say it they all loved me and respected me and would do any thing for me as if I was a Gentlewoman  But then what comes nextWhy it pleased God to take my good Lady and then comes my Master And what says heWhy in Effect it is  Be Not Virtuous  Pamela  So here have I lived above sixteen Years in Virtue and Reputation and all at once when I come to know what is Good and what is Evil I must renounce all the Good all the whole Sixteen Years Innocence which next to God's Grace I owed chiefly to my Parents and my Lady's good Lessons and Examples and chuse the Evil and so in a Moment's Time become the vilest of Creatures And all this for what I pray Why truly for a Pair of Diamond Earrings a Necklace and a Diamond Ring for my Finger which would not become me for a few paltry fine Cloaths which when I wore it would make but my former Poverty more ridiculous to  every body that saw me especially when they knew the base Terms I wore them upon But indeed I was to have a great Parcel of Guineas beside I forget how many for had there been ten times more they would have been not so much to me as the honest Six Guineas you trick'd me out of Mrs  Jewkes    Well forsooth but then I was to have I know not how many Pounds a Year for my Life and my poor Father there was the Jest of it was to be the Manager for the abandon'd Prostitute his Daughter And then there was the Jest again my kind forgiving virtuous Master would pardon me all my Misdeeds  Yes thank him for nothing truly And what pray are all these violent MisdeedsWhy they are for daring to adhere to the good Lessons that were taught me and not learning a new one that would have reversed all my former For not being contented when I was run away with in order to ruin me but contriving if my poor Wits had been able to get out of Danger and preserve myself honest  Then was he once jealous of poor  John  tho' he knew  John  was his own Creature and helped to deceive me  Then was he outrageous against poor Parson  Williams  and him has this good merciful Master thrown into Goal and for what Why truly for that being a Divine and a good Man he had the Fear of God before his Eyes and was willing to forego all his Expectations of Interest and assist an oppressed poor Creature  But to be sure I must be forward bold saucy and what not to dare to run away from certain Ruin and to strive to escape from an unjust Confinement and I must be married to the Parson nothing so sure  He would have had but a poor Catch of me had I consented but he and  you  too know I did not want to marry  any body  I only wanted to go to my poor Parents and to have my own Liberty and not to be confined to such an unlawful Restraint and which would not be inflicted upon me but only that I am a poor destitute young Body and have no Friend that is able to right me  So Mrs  Jewkes  said I here is my History in brief And I am a very unhappy young Creature to be sure And why am I soWhy because my Master sees something in my Person that takes his present Fancy and because I would not be undoneWhy therefore to chuse I must and I shall be undoneAnd this is all the Reason that can be given  She heard me run on all this time while I was undressing without any Interruption and I said Well I must go to the two Closets ever since an Affair of the Closet at the other House tho' he is so far off And I have a good mind to wake this poor Maid No don't said she I charge you I am very angry with her and she'll get no Harm there but if she wakes she may come tobed well enough as long as there is a Candle in the Chimney  So I looked into the Closetsand kneeled down in my own as I used to do to say my Prayers and this with my under Cloaths in my Hand all undrest and passed by the poor sleeping Wench as I thought in my Return But Oh little did I think it was my wicked wicked Master in a Gown and Petticoat of hers and her Apron over his Face and Shoulders What Meannesses will not  Lucifer  make his Votaries stoop to to gain their abominable Ends  Mrs  Jewkes  by this time was got tobed on the further Side as she used to be and to make room for the Maid when she should awake I got  into Bed and lay close to her And I said Where are the Keys tho' said I I am not so much afraid tonight Here said the wicked Woman put your Arm under mine and you shall find them about my Wrist as they used to be So I did and the abominable Designer held my Hand with her Righthand as my Rightarm was under her Left  In less than a quarter of an Hour I said There's poor  Nan  awake I hear her stir Let us go to sleep said she and not mind her She'll come tobed when she's quite awake Poor Soul said I I'll warrant she will have the Headach finely tomorrow for it Be silent said she and go to sleep you keep me awake and I never found you in so talkative a Humour in my Life Don't chide me said I I will say but one thing more Do you think  Nan  could hear me talk of my Master's Offers No no said she she was dead asleep I'm glad of that said I because I would not expose my Master to his common Servants and I knew  you  were no Stranger to his  fine  Articles Said she I think they were fine Articles and you were bewitch'd you did not close in with them But let us go to sleep So I was silent and the pretended  Nan  O wicked base villainous Designer what a Plot what an unexpected Plot was this seem'd to be awaking and Mrs  Jewkes  abhorred Creature said Come  Nan  what are you awake at last Pr'ythee come tobed for Mrs  Pamela  is in a talking Fit and won't go to sleep one while  At that the pretended She came to the Bed side and sitting down in a Chair where the Curtain hid her began to undress Said I Poor Mrs  Ann  I warrant your Head aches most sadly How do you doShe answer'd not one Word Said the superlatively wicked Woman You know I have order'd  her not to answer you And this Plot to be sure was laid when she gave her these Orders the Night before  I heard her as I thought breathe all quick and short Indeed said I Mrs  Jewkes  the poor Maid is not well What ails you Mrs  Ann  And still no Answer was made  But I tremble to relate it the pretended She came into Bed but quiver'd like an Aspenleaf and I poor Fool that I was pitied her muchBut well might the barbarous Deceiver tremble at his vile Dissimulation and base Designs  What Words shall I find my dear Mother for my Father should not see this shocking Part to describe the rest and my Confusion when the guilty Wretch took my left Arm and laid it under his Neck as the vile Procuress held my Right and then he clasp'd me round my Waist  Said I Is the Wench mad Why how now Confidence thinking still it had been  Nan  But he kissed me with frightful Vehemence and then his Voice broke upon me like a Clap of Thunder Now  Pamela  said he is the dreadful Time of Reckoning come that I have threaten'dI scream'd out in such a manner as never any body heard the like But there was nobody to help me And both my Hands were secured as I said Sure never poor Soul was in such Agonies as I Wicked Man said I wicked abominable Woman O God my God this  Time  this  one  Time deliver me from this Distress or strike me dead this Moment And then I scream'd again and again  Says he One Word with you  Pamela  one Word hear me but and hitherto you see I offer nothing to you Is this  nothing  said I to be in Bed here To hold my Hands between you I will hear if  you will instantly leave the Bed and take this villainous Woman from me  Said she O Disgrace of Womankind What you do Sir do don't stand dillydallying She cannot exclaim worse than she has done And she'll be quieter when she knows the worst  Silence said he to her I must say one Word to you  Pamela  it is this You see now you are in my PowerYou cannot get from me nor help yourself Yet have I not offer'd any thing amiss to you But if you resolve not to comply with my Proposals I will not lose this Opportunity If you do I will yet leave you  O Sir said I leave me leave me but and I will do any thing I ought to doSwear then to me said he that you will accept my Proposalsand then for this was all detestable Grimace he put his Hand in my Bosom With Struggling Fright Terror I fainted away quite and did not come to myself soon so that they both from the cold Sweats that I was in thought me dyingAnd I remember no more than that when with great Difficulty they brought me to myself she was sitting on one side of the Bed with her Cloaths on and he on the other with his and in his Gown and Slippers  Your poor  Pamela  cannot answer for the Liberties taken with her in her deplorable State of Death And when I saw them there I sat up in my Bed without any Regard to what Appearance I made and nothing about my Neck and he soothing me with an Aspect of Pity and Concern I put my Hand to his Mouth and said O tell me yet tell me not what I have suffer'd in this Distress And I talked quite wild and knew not what for to be sure I was on the Point of Distraction  He most solemnly and with a bitter Imprecation vow'd that he had not offer'd the least Indecency  that he was frighten'd at the terrible manner I was taken with the Fit That he would desist from his Attempt and begg'd but to see me easy and quiet and he would leave me directly and go to his own Bed O then said I take from me this most wicked Woman this vile Mrs  Jewkes  as an Earnest that I may believe you  And will you Sir said the wicked Wretch for a Fit or two give up such an Opportunity as this I thought you had known the Sex betterShe is now you see quite well again  This I heard more she might say but I fainted away once more at these Words and at his clasping his Arms about me again And when I came a little to myself I saw him sit there and the Maid  Nan  holding a Smellingbottle to my Nose and no Mrs  Jewkes    He said taking my Hand Now will I vow to you my dear  Pamela  that I will leave you the Moment I see you better and pacify'd Here's  Nan  knows and will tell you my Concern for you I vow to God I have not offered any Indecency to you And since I found Mrs  Jewkes  so offensive to you I have sent her to the Maid's Bed and the Maid shall lie with you tonight And but promise me that you will compose yourself and I will leave you But said I will not  Nan  also hold my Hand And will not she let you come in again to me He said by Heaven I will not come in again tonight  Nan  undress yourself go tobed and do all you can to comfort the dear Creature And now  Pamela  said he give me but your Hand and say you forgive me and I will leave you to your Repose I held out my trembling Hand which he vouchsafed to kiss and I said God forgive you Sir as you  have been  just in my Distress and as you  will be  just to what you promise And  he withdrew with a Countenance of Remorse as I hoped and she shut the Doors and at my Request brought the Keys tobed  This O my dear Parents was a most dreadful Trial I tremble still to think of it and dare not recal all the horrid Circumstances of it I hope as he assures me he was not guilty of Indecency but have Reason to bless God who by disabling me in my Faculties enabled me to preserve my Innocence and when all my Strength would have signified nothing magnified himself in my Weakness  I was so weak all Day on  Monday  that I lay abed My Master shew'd great Tenderness for me and I hope he is really sorry and that this will be his last Attempt but he does not say so neither  He came in the Morning as soon as he heard the Door open And I began to be fearful He stopt short of the Bed and said Rather than give you Apprehensions I will come no further I said Your Honour Sir and your Mercy is all I have to beg He sat himself on the Side of the Bed and asked kindly how I didbegg'd me to be compos'd said I still look'd a little wildly And I said Pray good Sir let me not see this infamous Mrs  Jewkes  I doubt I cannot bear her Sight She shan't come near you all this Day if you'll promise to compose yourself Then Sir I will try He pressed my Hand very tenderly and went out What a Change does this shewO may it be lasting But alas he seems only to have alter'd his Method of Proceeding but retains I doubt his wicked Purpose  On  Tuesday  about Ten o'Clock when my Master heard I was up he sent for me down into the Parlour  When I came he said Come nearer to me  Pamela  I did so and he took my Hand and said You begin to look well again I am glad of it You little Slut how did you frighten me on  Sunday  Night Sir said I pray name not that Night and my Eyes overflow'd at the Remembrance and I turn'd my Head aside  Said he Place some little Confidence in me I know what those charming Eyes mean and you shall not need to explain yourself For I do assure you that as soon as I saw you change and a cold Sweat bedew your pretty Face and you fainted away I quitted the Bed and Mrs  Jewkes  did so too And I put on my Gown and she fetch'd her Smellingbottle and we did all we could to restore you and my Passion for you was all swallowed up in the Concern I had for your Recovery for I thought I never saw a Fit so strong and violent in my Life and fear'd we should not bring you to Life again for what I saw you in once before was nothing to it This said he might be my Folly and my Unacquaintedness with what your Sex  can  shew when they are in Earnest But this I repeat to you that your Mind may be intirely comfortedAll I offer'd to you and that I am sure was innocent was before you fainted away  Sir said I that was very bad And it was too plain you had the worst Designs When said he I tell you the Truth in one Instance you may believe me in the other I know not I declare beyond this lovely Bosom your Sex but that I did intend what you call  the worst  is most certain And tho' I would not too much alarm you now I could curse my Weakness and my Folly which makes me own that I love you beyond all your Sex and cannot live without you But if I am Master of myself and my own Resolution I will not attempt to force you to any thing again Sir said I you may easily keep  your Resolution if you will send me out of your way to my poor Parents that is all I beg  'Tis a Folly to talk of it said he You must not shall not go And if I could be assur'd you would not attempt it you should have better Usage and your Confinement should be made easier to you But to what End Sir am I to stay said I You yourself seem not sure you can keep your own present good Resolutions and do you think if I was to stay when I  could  get away and be safe it would not look as if either I confided too much in my own Strength or would tempt my Ruin And as if I was not in Earnest to wish myself safe and out of DangerAnd then how long am I to stay And to what Purpose And in what Light must I appear to the World Would not  that  censure me altho' I might be innocent And you will allow Sir that if there be any thing valuable or exemplary in a good Name or fair Reputation one must not despise the World's Censure if one can avoid it  Well said he I sent not for you on this Account just now but for two Reasons The first is that you promise me that for a Fortnight to come you will not offer to go away without my express Consent and this I expect for  your own  sake that I may give you a little more Liberty And the second is That you will see and forgive Mrs  Jewkes  She takes on much and thinks that as all her Fault was her Obedience to me it would be very hard to sacrifice her as she calls it to your Resentment  As to the first Sir said I it is a hard Injunction for the Reasons I have mentioned And as to the second considering her vile unwomanly Wickedness and her Endeavours to instigate you more to ruin me when your returning Goodness seem'd to  have some Compassion upon me it is still harder But to shew my Obedience to your Commands for you know my dear Parents I might as well make a Merit of my Compliance when my Refusal would stand me in no stead I will consent to both and to every thing else that you shall be pleas'd to injoin which I can do with Innocence  That's my good Girl said he and kiss'd me This is quite prudent and shews me that you don't take insolent Advantage of my Favour for you and will perhaps stand you in more stead than you are aware of  So he rung the Bell and said call down Mrs  Jewkes  She came down and he took my Hand and put it into hers and said Mrs  Jewkes  I am oblig'd to you for all your Diligence and Fidelity to me but  Pamela  I must own is not because the Service I employ'd you in was not so very obliging to her as I could have wish'd she would have thought it and you were not to favour her but obey me But yet I'll assure you at the very first Word she has  once  obliged me by consenting to be Friends with you and if she gives me no great Cause I shall not perhaps put you on such disagreeable Service againNow therefore be you once more Bedfellows and Boardfellows as I may say for some Days longer and see that  Pamela  sends no Letters nor Messages out of the House nor keeps a Correspondence unknown to me especially with that  Williams  and as for the rest shew the dear Girl all the Respect that is due to one I must love if she will deserve it as I hope she will yet and let her be under no unnecessary or harsh Restraints But your watchful Care is not however to cease And remember that you are not to disoblige me to oblige her and that I will not cannot yet part with her  Mrs  Jewkes  look'd very sullen and as if she would be glad still to do me a good Turn if it lay in her Power  I took Courage then to drop a Word or two for poor Mr  Williams  but he was angry with me for it and said he could not endure to hear his Name in  my  Mouth so I was forc'd to have done for that time  All this time my Papers that I had bury'd under the Rosebush lay there still and I begg'd for Leave to send a Letter to you So I should he said if he might read it first But this did not answer my Design and yet I would have sent you such a Letter as he might see if I had been sure my Danger was over But that I cannot for he now seems to take another Method and what I am more afraid of because maybe he may watch an Opportunity and join Force with it on Occasion when I am least prepar'd For now he seems to abound with Kindness and talks of Love without Reserve and makes nothing of allowing himself in the Liberty of kissing me which he calls innocent but which I do not like and especially in the manner he does it but for a Master to do it at all to a Servant has Meaning too much in it not to alarm an honest Body  WEDNESDAY Morning  I Find I am watched and suspected still very close and I wish I was with you but that must not be it seems this Fortnight I don't like this Fortnight and it will be a tedious and a dangerous one to me I doubt  My Master just now sent for me down to take a Walk with him in the Garden But I like him not at all nor his Ways For he would have all the  way his Arm about my Waist and said abundance of fond Things to me enough to make me proud if his Design had not been apparent After walking about he led me into a little Alcove on the further Part of the Garden and really made me afraid of myself For he began to be very tiezing and made me sit on his Knee and was so often kissing me that I said Sir I don't like to be here at all I assure you Indeed you make me afraidAnd what made me the more so was what he once said to Mrs  Jewkes  and did not think I heard him and which tho' always uppermost with me I did not mention before because I did not know how to bring it in in my Writing  She I suppose had been encouraging him in his Wickedness for it was before the last dreadful Trial and I only heard what he answer'd  Said he I will try  once  more but I have begun wrong For I see Terror does but add to her Frost but she is a charming Girl and may be thaw'd by Kindness and I should have melted her by Love instead of freezing her by Fear  Is he not a wicked sad Man for thisTo be sure I blush while I write it But I trust that that God who has deliver'd me from the Paw of the Lion and the Bear that is his and Mrs  Jewkes  's Violences will also deliver me from this  Philistine  myself and my own Infirmities that I may not  defy the Commands of the Living God  But as I was saying this Expression coming into my Thoughts I was of Opinion I could not be too much on my Guard at all times more especially when he took such Liberties For he professed Honour all the Time with his Mouth while his Actions did not correspond I begg'd and pray'd he would let me go And had I not appear'd quite regardless  of all he said and resolved not to stay if I could help it I know not how far he would have proceeded For I was forced to fall down upon my Knees  At last he walk'd out with me still bragging of his Honour and his Love Yes yes Sir said I your Honour is to destroy mine and your Love is to ruin me I see it too plainly But indeed I will not walk with you Sir said I any more Do you know said he whom you talk to and where you are  You may believe I had Reason to think him not so decent as he should be for I said As to where I am Sir I know it too well and that I have no Creature to befriend me And as to who you are Sir let me ask you what you would have me answer  Why tell me said he What Answer you would make It will only make you angry said I and so I shall fare worse if possible I won't be angry said he Why then Sir said I you cannot be my late good Lady's Son for she lov'd me and taught me Virtue You cannot then be my Master for no Master demeans himself so to his poor Servant  He put his Arm round me and his other Hand on my Neck which made me more angry and bold and he said What then am I Why said I struggling from him and in a great Passion to be sure you are  Lucifer  himself in the  Shape  of my Master or you could not use me thus These are too great Liberties said he in Anger and I desire that you will not repeat them for your own sake For if you have no Decency towards  me  I'll have none to  you    I was running from him and he said Come back when I bid youSo knowing every Place was alike dangerous to me and I had nobody to run to  I came back at his Call and seeing him look displeased I held my Hands together and wept and said Pray Sir forgive me No said he rather say Pray  Lucifer  forgive me and now since you take me for the Devil how can you expect any Good from meHow rather can you expect any thing but the worst Treatment from meYou have given me a Character  Pamela  and blame me not that I act up to it  Sir said I let me beg you to forgive me I am really sorry for my Boldness but indeed you don't use me like a Gentleman and how can I express my Resentment if I mince the Matter while you are so indecent  Precise Fool said he what Indecencies have I offer'd youI was bewitch'd I had not gone thro' my Purpose last  Sunday  Night and then your licentious Tongue had not given the worst Name to little puny Freedoms that shew my Love and my Folly at the same time But begone said he taking my Hand and tossing it from him and learn another Conduct and more Wit and I will lay aside my foolish Regard for you and assert myself Begone said he again with a haughty Air  Indeed Sir said I I cannot go till you pardon me which I beg on my bended Knees I am truly sorry for my BoldnessBut I see how you go on You creep by little and little upon me and now sooth me and now threaten me and if I should forbear to shew my Resentment when you offer Incivilities to me would not that be to be lost by degrees Would it not shew that I could bear any thing from you if I did not express all the Indignation I  could  express at the first Approaches you make to what I dread And have you not as good as avow'd my RuinAnd have you once made me hope you will quit your Purposes against me  How then Sir can I act but by shewing my Abhorrence of every Step that makes towards my Undoing And what is left me but WordsAnd can these Words be other than such strong ones as shall shew the Detestation which from the Bottom of my Heart I have for every Attempt upon my Virtue Judge for me Sir and pardon me  Pardon you said he what when you don't repentWhen you have the Boldness to justify yourself in your Fault Why don't you say you never will again offend me I will endeavour Sir said I always to preserve that Decency towards you which becomes me But really Sir I must beg your Excuse for saying That when you forget what belongs to Decency in your Actions and when Words are all that are left me to shew my Resentment of such Actions I will not promise to forbear the strongest Expressions that my distressed Mind shall suggest to me nor shall your angriest Frowns deter me when my Honesty is in Question  What then said he do you beg Pardon for Where is the Promise of Amendment for which I should forgive you Indeed Sir said I I own that must absolutely depend on your Usage of me For I will bear any thing you can inflict upon me with Patience even to the laying down of my Life to shew my Obedience to you in other Cases but I cannot be patient I cannot be passive when my Virtue is at StakeIt would be criminal in me if I was  He said he never saw such a Fool in his Life And he walk'd by the Side of me some Yards without saying a Word and seem'd vex'd and at last walked in bidding me attend him in the Garden after Dinner So having a little Time I went up and wrote thus far  WEDNESDAY Night  IF my dear Parents I am not destin'd more surely than ever for Ruin I have now more Comfort before me than ever I yet knew And am either nearer my  Happiness  or my  Misery  than ever I was God protect me from the latter if it be his blessed Will I have now such a Scence to open to you that I know will alarm both your Hopes and your Fears as it does mine And this it is  After my Master had din'd he took a Turn into the Stables to look at his Stud of Horses and when he came in he open'd the Parlourdoor where Mrs  Jewkes  and I sat at Dinner and at his Entrance we both rose up but he said Sit still sit still and let me see how you eat your Victuals  Pamela  O said Mrs  Jewkes  very poorly Sir I'll assure you No said I pretty well Sir  considering  None of your  Considerings  said hePretty face and tapp'd me on the Cheek I blush'd but was glad he was so goodhumour'd but I could not tell how to sit before him nor to behave myself So he said I know  Pamela  you are a nice Carver My Mother used to say so My Lady Sir said I was very good to me in every thing and would always make me do the Honours of her Table for her when she was with her few select Friends that she lov'd Cut up said he that Chicken I did so Now said he and took a Knife and Fork and put a Wing upon my Plate let me see you eat that O Sir said I I have eat a whole Breast of a Chicken already and cannot eat so much But he said I must eat it for his sake and he would learn me to eat heartily So I did eat it but was much confused at his so kind and unusual Freedom and Condescension And  good Sirs you can't imagine how Mrs  Jewkes  look'd and star'd and how respectful she seem'd to me and call'd me  good Madam  I'll assure you urging me to take a little Bit of Tart  My Master took two or three Turns about the Room musing and thoughtful as I had never before seen him and at last he went out saying I am going into the Garden You know  Pamela  what I said to you before Dinner I rose and curt'sy'd saying I would attend his Honour and he said Do good Girl  Well said Mrs  Jewkes  I see how things will go O  Madam  as she call'd me again I am sure you are to be our Mistress And then I know what will become of me Ah Mrs  Jewkes  said I if I can but keep myself virtuous 'tis the most of my Ambition and I hope no Temptation shall make me otherwise  Nothwithstanding I had no Reason to be pleas'd with his Treatment of me before Dinner yet I made haste to attend him and I found him walking by the Side of that Pond which for want of Grace and thro' a sinful Despondence had like to have been so fatal to me and the Sight of which ever since has been a Trouble and Reproach to me And it was by the Side of this Pond and not far from the Place where I had that dreadful Conflict that my present Hopes if I am not to be deceiv'd again began to dawn which I presume to flatter myself with being an happy Omen for me as if God Almighty would shew your poor sinful Daughter how well I did to put my Affiance in his Goodness and not to throw away myself because my Ruin seem'd inevitable to my shortsighted Apprehension  So he was pleased to say Well  Pamela  I am glad you are come of your own Accord as I may say Give me your Hand I did so and he look'd at  me very steadily and pressing my Hand all the time at last said I will now talk to you in a serious manner  You have a great deal of Wit a great deal of Penetration much beyond your  Years  and as I thought your  Opportunities  You are possessed of an open frank and generous Mind and a Person so lovely that you excel all your Sex in my Eyes All these Accomplishments have engag'd my Affections so deeply that as I have often said I cannot live without you and I would divide with all my Soul my Estate with you to make you mine upon my own Terms These you have absolutely rejected and that tho' in saucy Terms enough yet in such a manner as makes me admire you more Your pretty Chitchat to Mrs  Jewkes  the last  Sunday  Night so innocent and so full of beautiful Simplicity half disarmed my Resolutions before I approach'd your Bed And I see you so watchful over your Virtue that tho' I hop'd to find it otherwise I cannot but say my Passion for you is increas'd by it But now what shall I say further  Pamela  I will make you tho' a Party my Adviser in this Matter tho' not perhaps my definitive Judge  You know I am not a very abandon'd Profligate I have hitherto been guilty of no  very  enormous or vile Actions This of seizing you and confining you thus may perhaps be one of the worst at least to Persons of real Innocence Had I been utterly given up to my Passions I should before now have gratify'd them and not have shewn that Remorse and Compassion for you which have repriev'd you more than once when absolutely in my Power and you are as inviolate a Virgin as you were when you came into my House  But what can I do Consider the Pride of my Condition I cannot endure the Thought of Marriage  even with a Person of equal or superior Degree to myself and have declin'd several Proposals of that kind How then with the Distance between us and in the World's Judgment can I think of making you my Wife Yet I must have you I cannot bear the Thoughts of any other Man supplanting me in your Affections And the very Apprehension of that has made me hate the Name of  Williams  and use him in a manner unworthy of my Temper  Now  Pamela  judge for me and since I have told you thus candidly my Mind and I see yours is big with some important Meaning by your Eyes your Blushes and that sweet Confusion which I behold struggling in your Bosom tell me with like Openness and Candour what you think I ought to do and what you would have me do  It is impossible for me to express the Agitations of my Mind on this unexpected Declaration so contrary to his former Behaviour His Manner too had something so noble and so sincere as I thought that alas for me I found I had Need of all my poor Discretion to ward off the Blow which this Treatment gave to my most guarded Thoughts I threw myself at his Feet for I trembled and could hardly stand O Sir said I spare your poor Servant's Confusion O spare the poor  Pamela  Speak out said he and tell me what I bid you What you think I ought to do I cannot say what you  ought  to do answer'd I But I only beg you will not ruin me and if you think me virtuous if you think me sincerely honest let me go to my poor Parents I will vow to you that I will never suffer myself to be engag'd without your Approbation  Still he insisted upon a more explicit Answer to his Question of what I thought he ought to do And I said As to  my  poor Thoughts of what you  ought to do I must needs say that indeed I think you ought to regard the World's Opinion and avoid doing any thing disgraceful to your Birth and Fortune and therefore if you really honour the poor  Pamela  with your Respect a little Time Absence and the Conversation of worthier Persons of my Sex will effectually enable you to overcome a Regard so unworthy of your Condition And this good Sir is the best Advice I can offer  Charming Creature lovely  Pamela  said he with an Ardor that was never before so agreeable to me this generous Manner is of a Piece with all the rest of your Conduct But tell me still more explicitly what you would advise me to in the Case  O Sir said I take not Advantage of my Credulity and these my weak Moments but were I the first Lady in the Land instead of the poor abject  Pamela  I would I  could  tell you But I can say no more  O my dear Father and Mother now I know you will indeed be concern'd for mefor now I am for myselfAnd now I begin to be afraid I know too well the Reason why all his hard Trials of me and my black Apprehensions would not let me hate him  But be assur'd still by God's Grace that I shall do nothing unworthy of your  Pamela  and if I find that he is still capable of deceiving me and that this Conduct is only put on to delude me more I shall think nothing in this World so vile and so odious and nothing if he be not the worst of his Kind as he says and I hope he is not so desperately guileful as the Heart of Man  He generously said I will spare your Confusion  Pamela  But I hope I may promise myself that you can love me preferably to any other Man and that no one in the World has had any Share in your  Affections for I am very jealous of what I love and if I thought you had a secret Whispering in your Soul that had not yet come up to a Wish for any other Man breathing I should not forgive  myself  to persist in my Affection for you nor  you  if you did not frankly acquaint me with it  As I still continued on my Knees on the Grass Slope by the Pondside he sat himself down on the Grass by me and took me in his Arms Why hesitates my  Pamela  said he Can you not answer me with Truth as I wish If you cannot speak and I will forgive you  O good Sir said I it is not  that  indeed it is not But a frightful Word or two that you said to Mrs  Jewkes  when you thought I was not in hearing comes cross my Mind and makes me dread that I am in more Danger than ever I was in my Life  You have never found me a common Liar said he too fearful and foolish  Pamela  nor will I answer how long I may hold in my present Mind for my Pride struggles hard within me I'll assure you and if you doubt me I have no Obligation to your Confidence or Opinion But at present I am really sincere in what I say And I expect you will be so too and answer directly my Question  I find Sir said I I know not myself and your Question is of such a Nature that I only want to tell you what I heard and to have your kind Answer to it or else what I have to say to your Question may pave the Way to my Ruin and shew a Weakness that I did not believe was in me  Well said he you may say what you have overheard for in nor answering me directly you put my Soul upon the Rack and half the Trouble I have  had with  you  would have brought to my Arms the finest Lady in  England    O Sir said I my Virtue is as dear to me as if I was of the highest Quality and my Doubts for which you know I have had too much Reason have made me troublesome But now Sir I will tell you what I heard which has given me great Uneasiness  You talked to Mrs  Jewkes  of having begun wrong with me in trying to subdue me with Terror and of Frost and suchlike you remember it well and that you would for the future change your Conduct and try to  melt  me that was your Word by Kindness  I fear not Sir the Grace of God supporting me that any Acts of Kindness would make me forget what I owe to my Virtue but Sir I may I find be made more miserable by such Acts than by Terror because my Nature is too frank and open to make me wish to be ingrateful and if I should be taught a Lesson I never yet learnt with what Regret should I descend to the Grave to think that I could not hate my Undoer And that at the last great Day I must stand up as an Accuser of the poor unhappy Soul that I could wish it in my Power to save  Exalted Girl said he what a Thought is that Why now  Pamela  you excel your self You have given me a Hint that will hold me long But sweet Creature said he tell me what is this Lesson which you never yet learnt and which you are so afraid of learning  If Sir said I you will again generously spare my Confusion I need not say it But  this  I will say in Answer to the Question you seem most solicitous about That I know not the Man breathing that I  would wish to be marry'd to or that ever I thought of with such a Hope I had brought my Mind so to love Poverty that I hop'd for nothing but to return to the best tho' the poorest of Parents and to employ myself in serving God and comforting them and you know not Sir how you disappointed my Hopes and my proposed honest Pleasures when you sent me hither  Well then said he I may promise myself that neither the Parson nor any other Man is any the least secret Motive to your stedfast Refusal of my Offers Indeed Sir said I you may and as you was pleased to ask I answer that I have not the least Shadow of a Wish or Thought for any Man living  But said he for I am foolishly jealous and yet it shews my Fondness for you have you not encourag'd  Williams  to think you will have him Indeed Sir said I I have not but the very contrary And would you not have had him said he if you had got away by his Means I had resolv'd Sir said I in my Mind otherwise and he knew it and the poor Man I charge you said he say not a Word in his Favour You will excite a Whirlwind in my Soul if you name him with Kindness and then you'll be borne away with the Tempest  Sir said I I have done Nay said he but do not have done let me know the whole If you have any Regard for him speak out for it would end fearfully for  you  for  me  and for  him  if I found that you disguis'd any Secret of your Soul from me in this nice Particular  Sir said I if I have ever given you Cause to think me sincere Say then said he interrupting me with great Vehemence and taking both my Hands between his Say That you now in the Presence  of God declare that you have not any the most hidden Regard for  Williams  or any other Man  Sir said I I do As God shall bless me and preserve my Innocence I have not Well said he I will believe you  Pamela  and in time perhaps I may better bear that Man's Name And if I am convinc'd that you are not prepossess'd my Vanity makes me assur'd that I need not to fear a Place in your Esteem equal if not preferable to any Man in  England  But yet it stings my Pride to the quick that you was so easily brought and at such a short Acquaintance to run away with that College Novice  O good Sir said I may I be heard one Thing and tho' I bring upon me your highest Indignation I will tell you perhaps the unnecessary and imprudent but yet the whole Truth  My Honesty I am poor and lowly and am not intitled to call it  Honour  was in Danger I saw no Means of securing myself from your avow'd Attempts You had shew'd you would not stick at little Matters and what Sir could any body have thought of my Sincerity in preferring that to all other Considerations if I had not escap'd from these Dangers if I could have found any way for it I am not going to say any thing for him but indeed indeed Sir I was the Cause of putting him upon assisting me in my Escape I got him to acquaint me what Gentry there were in the Neighbourhood that I might fly to and prevail'd upon him Don't frown at me good Sir for I must tell you the whole Truth to apply to one Lady  Jones  to Lady  Darnford  and he was so good to apply to Mr  Peters  the Minister but they all refus'd me and then it was he let me know that there was no honourable Way but Marriage  That I declin'd and he agreed to assist me for God's sake  Now said he you are going I boldly put my Hand before his Mouth hardly knowing the Liberty I took Pray Sir said I don't be angry I have just done I would only say That rather than have staid to be ruin'd I would have thrown myself upon the poorest Beggar that ever the World saw if I thought him honest And I hope when you duly weigh all Matters you will forgive me and not think me so bold and so forward as you have been pleas'd to call me  Well said he even in this your last Speech which let me tell you shews more your Honesty of Heart than your Prudence you have not overmuch pleas'd me But I  must  love you and that vexes me not a little But tell me  Pamela  for now the former Question recurs Since you so much prize your Honour and your Virtue since all Attempts against that are so odious to you and since I have avowedly made several of these Attempts do you think it is possible for you to love me  preferably  to any other of my Sex  Ah Sir said I and here my Doubt recurs that you may thus graciously use me to take Advantage of my Credulity  Still  perverse and doubting said he Cannot you take me as I am at present and that I have told you is sincere and undesigning whatever I may be hereafter  Ah Sir reply'd I what can I say I have already said too much if this dreadful  Hereafter  should take place Don't bid me say how well I can And then my Face glowing as the Fire I all abash'd lean'd upon his Shoulder to hide my Confusion  He clasp'd me to him with great Ardour and said Hide your dear Face in my Bosom my beloved  Pamela  your innocent Freedoms charm meBut then say How wellwhat  If you will be good said I to your poor Servant and spare her I cannot say too much But if not I am doubly undoneUndone indeed  Said he I hope my present Temper will hold for I tell you frankly that I have known in this agreeable Hour more sincere Pleasure than I have experienc'd in all the guilty Tumults that my desiring Soul put me into in the Hopes of possessing you on my own Terms And  Pamela  you must pray for the Continuance of this Temper and I hope your Prayers will get the better of my Temptations  This sweet Goodness overpower'd all my Reserves I threw myself at his Feet and embrac'd his Knees What Pleasure Sir you give me at these gracious Words is not lent your poor Servant to express I shall be too much rewarded for all my Sufferings if this Goodness hold God grant it may for your own Soul's sake as well as mine And Oh how happy should I be if  He stopt me and said But my dear Girl what must we do about the World and the World's Censure Indeed I cannot marry  Now was I again struck all of a Heap However soon recollecting myself Sir said I I have not the Presumption to hope such an Honour If I may be permitted to return in Peace and Safety to my poor Parents to pray for you there it is all I at present request This Sir after all my Apprehensions and Dangers will be a great Pleasure to me And if I know my own poor Heart I shall wish you happy in a Lady of suitable Degree And rejoice most sincerely in every Circumstance that shall make for  the Happiness of my late good Lady's most beloved Son  Well said he this Conversation  Pamela  is gone farther than I intended it You need not be afraid at this rate of trusting yourself with  me  But it is I that ought to be doubtful of myself when I am with  you  But before I say any thing further on this Subject I will take my proud Heart to Task and till then let every thing be as if this Conversation had never pass'd Only let me tell you that the more Confidence you place in me the more you'll oblige me But your Doubts will only beget  Cause  of Doubts And with this ambiguous Saying he saluted me in a more formal manner if I may so say than before and lent me his Hand and so we walk'd towards the House Sidebyside he seeming very thoughtful and pensive as if he had already repented him of his Goodness  What shall I do what Steps take if all this be designing O the Perplexities of these cruel DoubtingsTo be sure if he be false as I may call it I have gone too far much too farI am ready on the Apprehension of this to bite my forward Tongue or rather to beat my more forward Heart that dictated to that poor Machine for what I have said But sure at least he must be sincere for the  Time  He could not be such a practised Dissembler If he could O how desperately wicked is the Heart of Man And where could he learn all these barbarous Arts If so it must be native surely to the Sex But silent be my rash Censurings be hush'd ye stormy Tumults of my disturbed Mind for have I not a Father who is a ManA Man who knows no Guile who would do no Wrong who would not deceive or oppress  to gain a Kingdom How then can I think it is native to the Sex And I must also hope my good Lady's Son cannot be the  worst  of Men If he is hard the Lot of the excellent Woman that bore him But much harder the Hap of your poor  Pamela  who has fallen into such Hands But yet I will trust in God and hope the best and so lay down my tired Pen for this Time  The END of  VOL I
