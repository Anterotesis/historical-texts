 Two Great Questions  CONSIDERED  I What is the Obligation of Parliaments to the Addresses or Petitions of the People and what the Duty of the Addressers  II Whether the Obligation of the Covenant or other National Engagements is concern'd in the Treaty of Union  BEING A Sixth ESSAY At Removing  National Prejudices  Against the UNION  Printed in the Year MDCCVII  Two Great Questions considered  c  I Thought at the Writing each of these Papers that the Part before me would be the last and have been always Cautious of Crowding the Reader of these Essays with too many Subjects  But every Day brings with it New Occasions of Debate and 'tis in Vain for me to resolve upon silence unless I will abandone Truth and see it every Day insulted with Errors both in Practice and in Opinion  I have stood still and seen the Parliament throng'd with Addresses or Petitions and some of them in an Unusual Stile a Stile Parliaments in other Kingdoms resent with more Severity a great deal I have seen Authority insulted Her Majesty in the Person of Her Representative very ill Treated and all past over with Lenity and GentlenessTo this I have thought my self oblig'd to say nothing as not in my Sphere His Grace the High Commissioner and the Parliament kno' how to resent and when to resent and 'tis not my Business to presume to Direct  But after all this I cannot but take Notice of the Dialect of some People here which to me is very strange who have been talking very Confidently of going to ask the Parliament for an Answer to their Addressesthis in English I take to be Equivalent to Calling the Parliament to Account and some Gentlemen have as good as call'd it so  Indeed their Resolution has not been equal to their Project and they have not yet thought fit to put their Schemes in Practice but I thought it necessary for the Information of those who pretend to justifie such a Method to examine a little the Nature Right and Obligation of Adressing or Petitioning our Superiors and state the Point of Duty between both Addressers and the Persons Addressed And this is the first Article I shall enter upon in this Essay  Of Petitioning Parliaments and the Duty in that Case both of Parliament and People  AS this is a nicer Subject than ordinary and he that writes upon it may easily be misunderstood so I desire a little to explain my self before I proceed to the Particulars  And  first  I desire to note that I shall not distinguish in this Discourse between Addressing and Petitioning not but that there are Essential Differences between them and which used to be observed by the People Petitioning being applied to Requests only and Addressing to every thing congratulating or otherwise summary in representing the Subject it is upon  But Custom has now brought these things together the Address is call'd a Petition and the Petition an Address and as the Age makes no Distinction neither do I and therefore I desire thro' out this Paper to be understood promiscuously of both    dly  I note here that I shall in no wise dispute whether it be lawful upon all Occasions for the People to Address to or Petition the Parliament  I shall take it for granted and agree with any Body in this  That it is the undoubted Right of the People of any free Nation  but particularly of the three Kingdoms of  Scotland England  and  Ireland  to present their Grievances to their respective Authorities be it King or Parliament or both and to do it by Petition Address or any other way within the limited Prescription of the Law    When these Things by way of Note are first granted I know nothing more in the way of my Discourse but to come directly to the Subject of Petitioning or Addressing of Parliaments and in this 'tis necessary to consider    The Nature  of Petitioning or Addressing    The Manner  of Presenting    The Duty  of the Persons Addressed to    The Duty  of the Persons Addressing  The Nature of Addressing or Petitioning  And me thinks I need go no further than the very words themselves which without troubling my self to dive into their Etymologies and Original do plainly and expresly signify  the Posture of Supplicants  a Petition is in its Nature  a Prayer  a Begging or Entreating and let the Subject of the Petition be never so much Matter of Right it is by the Nature of the Thing submitted to the Pleasure  of the Persons Petitioned  either when to grant it or in such manner as they shall see meet or not to grant it at all  I confess we have of late seen different Steps taken in this Case and some Gentlemen are pleased to tell us of Addresses to the Parliament  Commanding them c  Others in their Addresses come with a  We hope and confidently Expect c  Of which by it self  However these Gentlemen think of their Method I must take the Liberty to tell such if they will act fairly and give every thing its proper Stile they should call such things  Representations or Remonstrances  not Addresses or Petitions  And therefore in our own Memories when the People of  Scotland  applyed themselves to the late King  William  for the Establishment of their Privileges they did not call it an Address or a Petition but  a Claim of Right    To petition or address must certainly acknowledge a Right in the Persons addressed to  either to grant or not to grant the thing addressed for  referring the Manner and Season of Granting to them and contents it self with having laid the Request before them  All other or further pursuing the Subject is Tumultuary and tends to Riot and Disorder the thing ceases then to be an Address or a Petition and becomes a  Demand  a Force or  Threatning of Force  which in its Nature is absolutely Destructive of the very Being and Substance of Government tends to all manner of Disorders and cannot be call'd Petitioning  And therefore that Reverend Divine that lately Preached in the  New Kirk  in this City speaking of this very thing had this most pertinent Expression  That when he considered some of the Addresses here they had on the Frontispiece the Words  AN HUMBLE PETITION  but if they were to Correspond  with the Substance  they should have been Stil'd  A BOLD DECLARATION  in Opposition to Authority  and that  he could not understand the Meaning of a Petition or Address  Sword in Hand  No truly nor can any Man else understand it by the Words for  Petition  and  Sword in Hand  are two contraries that do not Illustrate but really Destroy one another  In short  to Address or Petition is  to Pray  to  Desire  and to Submit to the Wisdom and Authority of the Person you Petition or Address to for the Granting or not Granting the Request all that goes beyond this is Excentrick Remote and Inconsistent not only with the Due Respect of Subjects to  Authority but with the Nature Substance of the Thing it self and indeed ought not to go by the Name of  Address  or  Petition    When the  Flemings  in the time of  Philip  the II made the Famous Petition to the Lady  Infanta  then Governess of the  Spanish Netherlands  tho they Petitioned for their Native Right and Liberty of Religion yet they Voluntarily took upon them the Name of  Geux  or Beggars and were call'd so on both sides signifying That tho' it was really their Right they Demanded yet while they did it by way of Petition it ought to be agreeable to the Nature of a Petition  viz  as a Prayer or Humble Request I omit the Application of this part till the last and proceed to Examine  The Manner of Petitioning  This respects the Words of the Petition and the Method of Petitioning  As to the Words  or Terms of the Petition As every Sermon ought to Conform to the Text every Book to its Title every Application to the Doctrine so every such Application to Authority ought to Conform to the Title which always bears the term HUMBLE in the Front of it  An Humble Address  or  An Humble Petition  and the like  I Confess there is room for Reflection enough here where Humility takes up the Title and all manner of Insolencies Scandals Reproaches and unjust Assertions fill up the Bodies of Addresses and Petitions are made in the Language of the  Spanish  Beggars who they say beg an Alms with the Hat in one hand and the Sword in the other  What else can we say of the Addressers that tell the Parliament they are  Acting contrary to the Fundamental Rights of the Nation that their Votes are Inconsistent with the Constitution of  Scotland  Enslaving them to  England  and Surrendering the Liberties and Freedoms  of the  Scots  Nation in plain Words  Betraying their Native Country to the  English  and Destroying that Foundation which is their Duty to preserve and defend  and the like  In all Nations such Addressings have been esteemed contrary to the Duty of Subjects contrary to the Nature of Addressing and contrary to the Dignity of Authority and therefore the Parliament of  England  in the Case of the Famous  Kentish Petition  show'd their Resentment not at Petitioning in General for that every Body allowed was the Privilege of the Subject but at the manner or Expression the Words of which were  That they would turn their Humble Addresses into Bills of Supply  Now tho' it was no Breach of Duty to Petition the Parliament to supply the King's wants for the Publick Good yet in this particular turn the Parliament thought the Petitioners took upon them to Reproach the House with trifling their time away in Complements and Addresses when the necessity of the Nation called for supplying the Publick for Action  This as out of the Sphere of a Petition they resented and therefore Voted it  Scandalous Insolent and Seditious  send for the Persons who presented it in Custody and afterwards committed them to the Gatehouse tho' Gentlemen of the best Quality in their Country  I am not arguing from hence what should be done here the Government here is Gentle Mild and bear a great deal but they ought not to have the more Insult put upon them for that very Reason  The manner or method of a Petition ought to Correspond with its Title be Humble the Expression Modest the Diction Decent Soft and Void of every thing Disrespectful Unmannerly and much less Untrue I mean the Language of it  As  to the manner of Delivery  this ought to be still more Courteously managed and to sute  First  the Customs of the Place in the Case of Petitions  Secondly  The Persons Petitioning and  Thirdly  The Persons who are Petitioned or Addressed to  The Decency due to Government and especially to  the Authority of Parliament  requires all possible Respect as it is the Supreme Authority of the Nation the Body cloathed with the Sanction of  Legislature  on one Hand and  Sovereign Judicature  on the otherAn humble Petition and humbly presented is without doubt the just Debt of applying to this PowerAll manner of Tumultuous Assemblings all manner of Threatning Appearances or Speeches are in this Case  Scandalous Insolent and Seditious  to lead direct Command much less threaten and speak roughly to them is an Insolence destructive to the very Nature of Government and the Distance of SubjectsWhat tho' they are the Servants of the State and accountable for Justice Truth and Liberty yet are they not subjected to the Insults of the Subject in the Execution of their Great TrustThe Authority they exercise is Sacred and ought not to be treated with Disrespect or Contempt  The long disputed Case of their being accountable never amounted to more than that they are accountable in Conscience Honour and Interest But it remains to prove that ever any Member representing his Country can be called to account in any Court for things done in Parliament either in this Kingdom or in  England  if they were no Man would serve his Country at that Price  The Method of Petitioning  therefore in your Neighbouring Kingdom is thus far Confin'd by Law to prevent all manner of Tumultuous Assemblies that  not more than five Persons can appear at the presenting any Petition  be the Subject of it of  never so Publick a Nature and this has effectually prevented the great Mischiefs of  Riotous Petitioning  which in their turn have proved Pernicious both to Government and to People in  England  and must have ill Consequences in any Country where such Exorbitances are unrestrain'd  But say the Objectors against this Doctrine Have we committed all our Power to our Representatives and is it in their Power to Ruin us all This brings me to the Third Head  Of the Duty of the Petitioned  And here I lay some Heads down for others to inlarge upon for in this small Tract I have not Room  All our Civil Rights are not subjected no not to Parliament as particularly 'tis not in their Power to take away the Right of being Represented tho' without doubt it is in their Power to Enlarge or  Contract Settle and Limit  the Number of the Representatives and the space of the Countries they shall Represent And whereas some infer from hence That then they may resolve the whole Representative into  a single Person  and they think they have a mighty Victory in thisI AnswerEvery part of the Kingdom which has been a separate Government must be separately Represented because its Right of being Represented began  in its separate State  and cannot be taken awayBut yet every Kingdom that by themselves or their Representatives Consent even to Suspend their being Represented at all may doubtless do it for a time  tho it cannot be for their Posterity  because the Right of being Represetned descends with the Land and  the Freeholder himself cannot give it away  Charters Burghs or Corporations  may be Forfeited and Disfranchised  but the Freehold Land  shall ever Entitle the Possessor to a Right of being Represented  According to Mr  Hodges  "  The Representative has all the Right and Power of the Freeholder  P"  And if so then he has this Authority much more and may  give away all  but I dare not run that length  A Representative cannot bind Conscience or oblige in Contradiction to the Laws of GODAll their Votes all their Authority ceases when once they Contraveen the express Laws of GOD and in that Case their Power is  ipso facto  Dissolved and  they cease to be a Legislature  in so far only as they Act against or in Opposition to the Divine Law the Apostles Question in that Case strongly implying the Negation  Whether it be lawful to obey GOD rather than Man judge ye  Nor can they make Laws against Nature or Reason but in every thing else they have the full Legislative and Judicature committed to them and it can not be Rational to subject them to the Tumultuous Authority of their Constituents  I know it is affirm'd here That the Barons have a Right if they please to Decline a Representative and come up and sit in Person as the Peers do  Whether they have such a Right or no is not my business to Debate here  but I'll offer one Negative to such an absurd Notion  that I believe will serve to the present Case  viz  That  they cannot have such a Right now  for this Current Parliament they having by their Election already concluded themselves  for this time  if ever they have such a Right  which nevertheless I do not grant  it must be when a new Parliament is to be chosenBut the Case for this Parliament is Determin'd and cannot be altered  But how far then is a Parliament obliged by the Addresses of the Heretors or Constituents and what is their Duty in such Cases  For this is the Grand Question before us  I Answer  Addresses if decently  Worded  Dutifully with respect to Authority  Presented  and Significant in their Nature  ought to be received  and in this part I must own The Parliament of  Scotland  have been over and above regardful of their Duty for that they have received  such  Addresses containing  such  Insulting of their Authority  such  Arraigning their Proceedings  such  Leading their Voices  such  Limiting their Legal Power and  such  Indecent and Disrespectful Treating their Persons as no Subject in these Ages have ever that I remember done with Impunity in any Nation but thisand therefore I think  with Submission  no Objection will ly against them on that Score  Nor is it the Duty of Representatives to receive only the Addresses of the Subjects but indeed they seem to me to owe a Reading and  if the Substance require it  to consider and debate the Matters laid before them in it If any Man shall ask so weak a Question as who shall be Judge whether the Substance require their Debates or no  The Nature of Debating answers that  for they can debate upon nothing else but the Merits of the Petition And if they find it frivolous or vexatious without question they may either  lay it asleep in the house  by the still Voice of a general Neglect or  cast it back with Resentment  as the Case in their Opinion deserves  If this be not in their Choice  then it is no more an Address or Petition but a Precept or  Mandamus  the People signing it are no more  Addressers  Petitioners or  Desirers  but  Directors  and  Preceptors  and the whole Scale of Order inverts to Democracy and Confusion  Doubtless and I believe any Member of Parliament will allow me this if the Parliament in Case of an Address  presented receiv'd and considered find  Matter of Right  in it the Subjects Grievances  truly  represented and the Demand  just  if an Oppression to be remedied if injurious Encroachments on Right and Property are to be removed if any thing previous be there  laid before them  in which they see the Subject injur'd and that 'tis in their Power to right him tho the Addresser be never  so  mean  so  low or  so  despicable and tho the Injury were back'd with never  so much Power  they are bound in Duty in Conscience and in regard to the Trust committed to them to answer the said Request redress right restore and help the injur'd People whose Rights they are entrusted to protect and defend  I shall not enlarge on the Duty of a Representative I see no Members here stand in need of my weak Instructions or that want to be put in mind of their Duty to their Country  Of the Duty of Petitioners  I come now to the last Article and the main Occasion of this Tract the Duty of Persons addressing or petitioning for without question there is a Duty due there too how negligent soever People are of it and how willing soever some are to forget the Obligation  And here I must begin with Negatives and I cannot but put you in mind of the honest Minister at the New Kirk who told ye that he did not understand addressing to Authority with SWORD IN HAND This as that Gentleman very well said is rather a bold Declaration than an humble Address  If People will addresslet them do it  like an Address  if they will petition let it be  a Petition  On the other hand if they will remonstrate let them remonstrate and be plain if they have Reason and Justice no doubt the Parliament will hear them both ways But to remonstrate and address both  in a breath that's like the  French  King making War while  he gives Peace to  Europe To have it be an Humble Address in the Title and  a bold Declaration  in the Body of the Paper this is neither Peace nor War it looks no way and every way all together In short 'tis neither Honest nor Legal 'tis not Legal because 'tis against Government and does not correspond with lawful Authority and 'tis not honest because it does not correspond  with it self  it calls it self one thing really is another it has a Silken Face and a Steely Heart a Smile on the Brow and a Grin in the Thought 'tis Unjust and Unfair  If you will be call'd Addressers or Petitioners you must act as such or else 'tis honester  to quit the Title    The Duty of Addressers in the next place is to leave the Matter of their Addresses to the Consideration of the Persons addressed or petitioned and to acquiesce in their Determination or Judgment An Address that will have  no Nay  is no more an Address but as I said before a Precept and Direction  To such  for such I find here  I cannot but speak a word by way of DirectionAt the same time that you plead for a Right of Petitioning I hope you do not demand a Right or by it mean a Right of directing  I confess I am at some loss to know how some Gentlemen who address'd the present Parliament would have us to understand these Words WE HOPE AND CONFIDENTLY EXPECT Words frequently used in some Addresses I have seen here whether they really have any  Confidence  in the Parliament or no I cannot tell 'tis my Opinion they have ENOUGH in the Expression  A Right of Petitioning I agree is undoubted but what Authority these Gentlemen will bring for a Right to oblige the Parliament to follow their Directions I cannot imagine any more than I can how  they would properly be called a Parliament or Representative if that Power were left in the Persons they represent  As therefore I would by no means lessen the Authority of the People in the Reserves of Right left them and  which are not Committed to the Representatives  so I would by no means Reduce Parliaments to Mobs and Rabbles and make them pay their Homage every day to the  Absolute Directions  of their Constituents this were indeed to sacrifice to OUR SOVEREIGN LORD THE PEOPLE this were to level the Legislators as a late Author has it  to the Will and Humour of the People  State of the Controversie  Page  This were to make the Members Representatives and the Mob be the Parliament GOD deliver this Nation from the Confusion of such a Constitution and the Consequences of such kind of Doings  The People without doubt have Committed to their Representatives the Management of all their Civil Affairs the power of Making Explaining Amending Executing and Repealing LawsIn these terms are concluded all the Trusts that are contain'd in Life Limb Property and EstateThis Management extends to Subjecting Life and Estate to Punishment for Crimes Stating Protection to Property and Administration of Justice Regulating Altering Limiting and Declaring all things belonging to Government Succession Constitution and Executive Power  In all these things you are to Acquiesce and Submit to the Determination of the Representatives  you  mark that  your selves  having Constituted and Appointed them by a Voluntary Legal Choice your Deputies your Plenipotentiaries to Concert Settle and Establish all these things in your behalf  If your nearest Relations break the Laws they make you follow them to the Gibbet with Regret and Lamentations at the Misfortune in Committing the Crime but no Complaint at the  Makers of the Law  ye Acquiesce in that as the Act and Deed of the Parliament  'Tis hard we should Acquiesce in some things and scruple others since their Authority is Equal in all  What has been said on this Part will however bear this just Inference and 'tis one of the best Uses I can turn the Discourse to  viz  This Doctrine quite overthrows the Legality of People first addressing and then assembling to make an open Demand of an Answer or what else they please to call it to their Address  And those Gentlemen that find fault with the late Proclamation for preventing such Assembling as Illegal can never defend the Legality of their Part to come in a Body as some People call it expecting therefore the more Respect This can have no other nor better Construction than to say We will make such an Appearance as shall awe the Parliament by our Numbers to grant our Demands  I would not be a forward Censurer of the Designs of any Body further than Reason justifies but I cannot see it will bear any other Construction and if not then it is directly contrary to the very Nature of Addressing as well as to the Duty and Deference owing to Parliamentary Authority  What can the meaning of Number be but Strength what their Appearing  but Force  The Government therefore are highly justified in exerting the needful Authority entrusted to them for that end in preventing the early Beginnings of those Assemblies that contrary to the Nature and true Meaning of Addressers design'd to have aw'd or influenc'd the Parliament in their Appearance  Those Gentlemen who ever they are that contriv'd that Design were in my Opinion strangely mistaken in their Measures and have something to account for to their Discretion if they had really a Design to have insulted the Parliament for they could not but imagine that an Attempt of drawing together undiscerned must be impossible in a City no bigger than this and in a Government that  God be praised  has their Eyes about them  Nor could they expect but at the first Appearance of a Concourse of Strangers the Town would be allarm'd their Design be discovered and consequently prevented  But I must own they made amends for their want of Forecast in the Design by the Discretion of laying it aside at last and not ruining themselves and their Friends upon the certain Destruction of an impracticable Attempt and I doubt not they will be sensible by this time that they were in the wrong  But this by the way that Part I am upon is in short thus All Tumultuary Parts of Management in Matters of Addressing or Petitioning Parliaments or Governours is not contrary to the Laws only but contrary to the Nature of Addressing contrary to the Duty of Subjects and ought rather to be call'd Bold Declarations in Opposition to Legal Authority  II Of the Obligation of National Oaths  THis is a new Point and if handled in a way that may seem something new the Gentlemen concerned will I hope not be under any Surprize since it will only discover that some People raised their Scruples more for want of due Enquiry than from the real Difficulty of the Question  Most People who have entred upon this Article have amused us with the Enquiries into the Extent of the Oaths and Obligations which this Nation lyes under and with Debating how far they are or are not binding to the Posterity of those that took them and these Enquiries have one peculiar which seems very natural to them  Scilicet  To leave People as much or more in the Dark than they found them  The various Opinions and weak Arguments on both sides entangle the Subject and serve only to leave it a doubtful Point which no body can unravel this is what the Enemies of the Truth aim at and are very well satisfied with and indeed it answers their end but too well  The Broachers of Opinions in the World have in all Ages fled to this Refuge  viz  When strength of Reasoning would not support their Errors they struggle to cloud the Argument with abstrufe Conjectures ambiguous Interpretations dark and difficult Suggestions and any thing that may render the Subject mysterious for that if once the Doctrine has but difficulty enough in it to divide the Opinions of Men and have some be of one mind and some of another in the matter they gain the Point and 'tis odd but some espouse it be the Error never so gross  To avoid this Evil in the Case in hand to take from the Adversary the Advantage of making this a  Moot point  and that leaving People Doubting and Unsatisfied they may bring them out of Love with the occasion I shall come quite another way  and I hope a nearer way  to the Truth  To state the Question right is the way to make this plain Truth  yet plainer  and I think it lyes as follows  There are National Obligations which have been taken in  Scotland  either by us our Fathers and which we hold our selves equally bound towhich in their Nature interfere with our Incorporating with  England  in the present proposed Ʋnion    That this is the true state of the Question I could prove from  too many  of the weak and ill temper'd Arguments which some People have made use of in Publick to Defend their Clamours at the Treaty and which I only Conceal because I would not record the folly of the Persons who I hope may in time come to be better Inform'd and I am unwilling to leave them any thing to blush at  But to put my Argument right I must back it with one Authentick Quotation  viz  Out of the so well known Address of the Presbytery of  Hamilton  to the Parliament a Thing I shall have occasion to mention again in the course of this Tract the Words are thus  But that which more especially obliges us in Duty and Conscience  as Ministers of the Gospel of Peace  most Humbly to Interpose with your Grace and Lordships is the Lamentable and Distracted state of the Kingdom and particularly the People under our Pastoral Charge from the  sad Apprehension they have  of the Woful Consequences of  such an Union  to their Liberties Civil and ReligiousAnd that  IT CANNOT BE ENTRED INTO  by the Nation  in the Terms  without Incurring the Guilt of  NATIONAL PERJURY  This is plain to my purpose and Justifies my proposed state of the Question  I shall not spend the Readers time here to state the Obligations nor shall I repeat the Oaths or Covenants which are here meant further than to lay it down just as the Gentlemen themselves alledge  viz  That having taken an Oath or entred into a Solemn Engagement either they or their Fathers  for that they say is all one  obliging themselves as far as shall be in their power to Support and Maintain the Reformation of Religion against all Error or Novations whatsoever together with an Obligation to Maintain and Defend the Kings Person  the Laws and Parliamentary Authority all the lawful Jurisdictions  c  as may be seen at large in the National Confession  This they say obliges them to have no Union with a Nation professing contrary to this Principle much less with a Nation whose Church is establisht upon that very Episcopacy which they think themselves obliged by their Oath and in both their National and Church Capacity to Abolish and pull down  Then as to Civil Matters they are oblig'd  they say by this Oath  to Maintain and Defend the Parliament Government and Sovereignty of  Scotland  and the like which they apprehend they do not do by the Union  I'll do the Gentlemen that Justice to acknowledge that they begin very much to decline the last Objection being  as they search into it  further and further Convinc'd of the Weakness of that partand especially as a thing they are not so Solicitous aboutBut as to the first they seem very positive and warm in the case  I shall not lay the stress of this Matter where these People do and therefore the Triumph they make over those that Argue against the Obligation of National Oaths on the Posterity of the People taking them shall stand them in no stead here for I'll readily grant them for Argument sake  whether I believe it or no is not material  That the National Oaths or Covenant or both which their Fathers took has all that Obligation they alledge  let that also be what it will  on us their Children That they having eaten these sour Grapes our Teeth are set on edge by them and that by no Shift Evasion Subterfuge or whatever Contrivance we can be cleared of the Bond  Having granted this I hope no Man will take it ill if I very narrowly search all the unhappy Policies of this perverse  Generation to bring us in Bound  by these National Obligations  not to unite with  England    'Tis not at all to the present Purpose whether we are bound by these Oaths but whether do these Oaths prevent our joining with  England  in the Terms of the Union and whether it be true or no as is quoted from the Presbytery of  Hamilton That it cannot be entred into without incurring the Guilt of National Perjury    To enquire directly into thisit will be necessary to distinguish here the Obligation of the Oath and the Substance of the Treaty of Union  The Obligation is against the Invasions of Error and for preserving the Purity of Religion 'tis an Oath to maintain and defend the Presbyterian Government and Discipline of the Church This I take to be a fair Abstract of it  Now against this let us set the Treaty and see what are the Stipulations between the Two Kingdoms and without running thro' the Articles they consist in general Heads of Agreement and mutual Coalition in Matters of Civil Government Communication of Privileges Regulations of State and  Postulata  of TradeAnd pray Gentlemen take it along with you there is not in the Treaty one word of the things contain'd in the Oaths we are upon nor are any of the Heads of those Oaths concern'd here Of which presently  Next let us distinguish here of the Subjects of these Oaths on one hand and the Subjects of the Treaty on the other hand and the several Capacities of either as they respect the Case in hand and here we shall find them also as distinct and unconcern'd as if they were not the same Persons  The Subjects of the Oaths are the People of  Scotland  Nationally consider'd in their Ecclesiastick Capacity or the People of  Scotland  in their Religious Capacity as Presbyterians reform'd from Popery and Prelacy and erected in a National  Church which they engage solemnly to defend and I would have them defend it to the end of the World  The Subjects of the Treaty of Union are the People of  Scotland  in their Politick Capacity as a Government under a limited Monarchy a Queen reigning vested with a Legal Undoubted and Undisputed Right a Parliament Representing Sitting and acting by Law and both together legally and beyond the Power of Cavil vested with Right and Authority to debate of and determine every thing which may be for the Publick Good of the Body to be Governed and which relates to Civil Right Law Justice and Policy  That to distinguish the People of  Scotland  thus in their several Capacities Politick and Religious is just and to the Purpose will easily appear in that they are distinguish'd so already both in the Nature of the Thing and in the different Pacts of Government  The Government of the State including all the latter Branch of the above Distinction is entirely separate from Unconcern'd with has no Influence upon nor is at all influenc'd by the Government of the Church which is the former Branch of the said Distinction The Parliament represents the People in their Civil Capacity the Church has no Voice in the Election nor is at all Represented there nor is any thing cognizable there relating to the Religious Capacity of any Individual Subject of  Scotland  The Civil Government has indeed the Ecclesiastick in its Protection and 'tis its Duty to defend and support itBut even the Queen and Parliament cannot no not by Law dethrone the Power and Constitution of the Church of  Scotland  as Presbyterianbecause it will for ever be just as is express'd in the Claim of Right That the People ought to have that Religion establish'd which is their own Choice  Nor are they distinct in the Government only but in the very Persons governing the People of  Scotland  in their Civil Capacities are governed by the Queen and the Laws Justice and Legislature is lodg'd in the Queen and the Parliament and all Men are Subject to it  The People of  Scotland  in their Religious Capacity are governed by the Ecclesiastick Authority of Session Presbytery Synod and Assembly and to these even the Sovereign and Parliament in their Ecclesiastick and Separate Capacity are pleased to be Subject  Thus I defend the Distinction as to the Subjects of the respective Cases before us  Things thus set clear of one another and examin'd apart I must confess to me it is one of the profoundest Mysteries in Nature and I can see no shadow of a Discovery how the Union of two Nations in their meer Civil and Politick Concerns can affect their Religious Concern  But to come nearer yetThese Things are not only divided and distinguish'd in their own Nature but they are expresly distinguish'd in the Treaty it self which professes to unite the two Kingdoms in their Civil and Politick Capacity as to Oeconomy Government Interest and Commerce but expresly reserves to each the Separate State and Absolute Independency of all their Religious Affairs  To make this more clear care was taken to remove all manner of Jealousies on either hand by expresly providing limiting and forbidding That the Commissioners on either side should have any Authority to Treat of Matters relating to the Church  The Reason was plain the Union was not concern'd in it the Churches in either Kingdom were settled fixt and Established and were so to remain They were not to Unite or to Treat about Uniting the Business of the Union  is not to bring them together but to keep them asunder not to bring them into one Government but to secure them in their being two  The Church of  Scotland  or the People of  Scotland  in their Religious Capacity have no Concern in the Treaty they are not at all Uniting the Pale of Distinction is as firm and if I may say it the Church of  Scotland  better Secured and better Fixt as to Humane Power than ever it was before having the Faith of a Treaty perhaps more Solemn than ever was yet made in the World to Support her and all the Men of Honesty and Principle in the whole Island to Support and Defend to Recognize and see to the Execution of that Treaty  If then the Independency of the Religious Government in  Scotland  be thus reserv'd and secur'd I cannot see which way the Oaths or Covenants of the People of  Scotland  in Religious Matters are any way infring'd because indeed not any way concern'd in or subjected to any Article of the Treaty  The  First  Objection I meet with here is Yet we are subjected to the Legislation of Bishops  To this much might be said as that they are Barons and Vote in the House of Lords as such but exercise no Spiritual Authority there And I do not see but if an Ecclesiastick in  Scotland  either by Blood came to be a Peer or by Vote was Chosen a Representative in  Scotland  he might sit in Parliament too but I wave that My direct Answer here is  You as a Church have no hand in the placing them there for in your Ecclesiastick Capacity you have no Concern in the Ʋnion at all nor the Church of  England  neither  To clear your Consciences from the Guilt and your selves from the Subjection you Protest against your  being Subjected in any Religious Matters to their Vote  And let what Pretences so ever be made here I see no Room for any Question whether this does not effectually clear you since you have neither Agency in the Fact nor are subjected to the Consequences How then can the Oath be affected here  But say some Gentlemen  more willing to be Scrupulous than to be answered  We are bound as far as lyes in us to pull down Prelacy even in  England    This is a wild Objection I confess and more wildly made use of by some People  Either this is an Ecclesiastical Obligation or a Civil one both it cannot be  If it be a Civil Obligation how will you understand it Are you to do it by Force If so the very Words  As far as in our Power  are against you  Ʋltra posse non est esse  I presume no Man will say he is bound to the Attempt whether possible or no like the Fifth Monarchymadmen in  England  who were to Crown King  Jesus  with an Army of Men and so went out  to fight the Lord against the Mighty  'Tis plain the Impossibility on that side Dissolves the Nature of the Oath  If it be an Ecclesiastical Oath it must be executed in an Ecclesiastical manner and here all your Weapons are put into your Hands and a fair Field given you and I long I confess to see the War begun But what are the Weapons Truly they are terrible ones  THE WORD  and  PRAYER  and here you may Execute your Engagements to the full  PRAY  them down and  PREACH  them down and  LIVE  them down and the sooner this Strife begins the better I am sure the Union will be far from Obstructing it and I  wish all the Strife in  Britain  I mean as to Religion was reduced to this  In short to any that are willing to judge Impartially it must be evident the Church of  Scotland  has no manner of Concern in this Treaty as a Church her Establishment is founded upon the Laws which Laws are made Inviolable by the Treaty no ways subjected to the Parliamentary Power that shall follow and Consequently intirely free from the Legislation of the Episcopal Clergy of  England    Upon this Foundation being laid it must follow that the Oaths or Obligations insisted upon here are not at all affected by this Ʋnion And therefore with Submission to the  Presbytery of  Hamilton there can be no shadow  of National Perjury in it    As to any parts of the Oaths which seems to engage the People of  Scotland  not to alter their Constitution it would be Ridiculous and Absurd For then  mo  They must pretend they are Bound never to mend their Condition tho' the greatest Advantages in the World were to be offered them  do  Tho' Subversion at Home or Invasion Abroad offered it self they could not  Unite  with any Body tho for the support Preservation of themselves to bind themselves to these things would make it an unlawful Oath for every Man and every Government is bound to do all possible and lawful things for the Good and Advantage of the Publick and to Swear not to do that Good which is your Duty would be unlawful  All the Cavils at the Form have been effectually answer'd already I shall repeat nothing nor enquire any more into the Suggestions of the Treaty being an entire Surrender of the Constitution dissolving subjecting  c  The word UNION is an Answer to it Union cannot be a Subjection the word TREATY is another How can a Treaty upon  Conditions be a Surrender of Freedom how can making of Agreements upon Articles be call'd a Subjection  I see nothing needful to add to this Argument I would be glad to hear what any Mens Scruples may dictate by way of further Objection But till then I must conclude the Oaths and National Obligations of the People of  Scotland  are not at all concern'd in this Union how binding soever they may be in other Cases  To fill People then with Scruples at the Publick Affairs and alarm them with breaking Oaths National Perjury and the like Where the Oath is not at all concern'd is nothing but the Effect of Party Insinuations a Handle form'd to be taken hold of to serve a Turn and to fright Innocent People from joining in the Good of their Native Country  I must confess I know not what to say to the Multiplying Oaths on either hand and heartily wish neither Nation were so much encumbred with them as they are A General Union of Temper and Affection which I hope will at last follow the Union of Politicks will soon take away not the Obligation but the occasion of these Bonds from us all  I cannot therefore sufficiently Applaud the Prudence of the Publick in the case of a new invented Oath here lately offered in the Commission and afterward in Parliament and Rejected in both  I must confess I think there are good Reasons to be given against Imposing Oaths of any sort upon the Subject other than the common Oath of Obedience to the Government which is a Reciprocal Obligation the King or Queen taking an Oath to Govern and the Subjects to Obey and both with this Sanction as the Test of the Obligation  viz  ACCORDING TO LAW  The frequency of Oaths has in my Observation these Fatal but Constant Mischiefs attending it  First  That it tends  to lessening the Solemnity of the thing by making a formal Swearing familiar to the People and I could give sad Instances of this in  England  where the Word a CustomHouse Oath is become such a Proverb and the thing such a Jest that 'tis fitter to be called a Customary Oath and in some other Cases I believe I could instance in some Oaths of Freedoms and Corporations which I may say 'tis Impossible to keep  If these things are true as I do not desire to prove because I had rather conceal them I think they should caution any Nation against Crouding the People with Oaths and especially unnecessary ones  In all kinds of Oaths relating to payment of Taxes there are snares to the People and this effect follows of course that he gets most Money whose Conscience is loosest he that can Swear hardest pays least and the Man of Conscience who dare not Tamper with his Maker nor hurry up his Meaning in Suppositions but when he is to Swear considers of the Fact and confines himself to the Truth lyes under the Discouragement of paying the most Duties and being Undersold and Injured in his Trade  This is my Observation only on Oaths in general but as to Religious Tests and Oaths by way of Equivalent I must confess there is something Astonishing in it to see some Gentlemen warm for them that have so freely Censured and perhaps too justly their Neighbours for making the like  I frankly own I believe the Sacramental Test Imposed in  England  a thing unlawful in its Nature and Irreligious as it is a Debasing the Sacred Institutions of Christ Jesus to Uses Differing Remote and perhaps Contrary to their Primitive Institution and I make no question but even the Church of  England  themselves when further Inlightned from Heaven and the time of their Compleat Reformation shall come will free the Nation from those Ecclesiastical Fetters which are the  only remains of the Tyranny and Popish Practices of the late Abdicated times  But how it came into the Thoughts of any People here  who at the same time have been very free with  England  on that head  to fall into the same evil and prepare the very same Chains for their Native Country under which their Neighbours so loudly groan and for which they so loudly have blam'd them is a Mystery past my understanding  The Parliament have therefore very wisely Rejected their Proposal as the Commission had done before and the Gentlemen who too hastily came in to it will I doubt not in time see that they have cause to be Thankful for being delivered tho' against their Wills  I kno' 'twill be objected here that the Oath proposed was only design'd for such of the  English  Nation  c  that should come to enjoy Places of Trust or Profit in  Scotland    But give me leave to let such Gentlemen know that ye had thereby opened the Door to the thing in general and by Approving the placing Religious Oaths on their Civil Imployments tho now confin'd to Strangers they for ever stopped their own Mouths against all possible Objection if the same in time to come should on any other occasion be expected of them  They could never have argued against the Lawfulness of the thing they could never have fenc'd against the Prophaness and Irreligion of it the Dishonour  c  It is to the Institution and Nature of an Oath since their Mouths would be effectually stopp'd by telling them That when it serv'd their own turn they could descend to the very same thing and were for hampering the Consciences of others  Besides who is it they would have bound to own the Presbyterian Church of  Scotland  upon Oath And let us examine a little the Reason and Kindness of it  The Answer will be ready I kno'  'tis the  EnglishWell Gentlemen and who among the  English  would you entangle thus the honest Men or the Knaves 'Tis plain the last will not be entangled by it for they'll take fourty Oaths to get a good Place there's none but the honest Men that you can have a Design upon and 'tis a little hard you should contrive Methods to let the Knaves in among you and shut honest Men out  Well but says another warm Gentleman We would keep Church of  England  Men out in general  Say you so Sir Then you should have alter'd your Oath and have made it that the Person should have sworn That he was not of the Church of  England  or to abjure Episcopacy or some Oath particularly bent against Prelacy in general or the Church of  England  in particular But 'tis plain this Oath would as effectually have foreclosed three parts in four of all the Dissenters in  England  as well as all that were Conscientious among the Church So that in short only one Sect of Dissenters might come among you for which many of your honest Brethren of the Dissenters with whom you make no scruple to join in Communion when you come to  England  are excluded for which they are very much beholding to you  I might here enter upon a Debate against the making an Oath of FaithI believe there is room to question whether in the Nature of the Thing call'd Faith every Man can swear to what he believes swear that he believes this or that Church to be the only true Church or this or that Worship to be the only true Worship  Likewise I must own I think 'tis very hard to make any Man swear  as in a certain Oath is express'd  to continue in the Profession Obedience of this or that Religion or Opinion all the days of our Lives whereas perhaps the Person may be some  time or other possessed in his Conscience with Convictions that he ought to alter some part of that Profession either as to Doctrine or Discipline Fundamental or Circumstance  But I omit entring on this Debate not that I think it difficult but with the Apostle I say I hope without prophaness  I have many things to say but you cannot bear them now    The End of this Discourse is in order to open the Eyes of those wellmeaning People who seem prejudic'd that the Parliament has not agreed to the proposed Oaths but has cautiously refused to put that Knife into their Hands with which they would ha' wounded themselves  They can have no Reason to be uneasy at this since 'tis what no Man can defend 'tis the Burthen the Bondage and in my Opinion the Scandal of their Neighbour Nation and what I could say if the Season were proper this Treaty would in some measure ha' delivered them from had the Gentlemen here not thought fit to raise that Devil which I doubt will not be in their Power to lay But of this I may have occasion to speak hereafter and at present do not think it reasonable to explain my self further  I believe both Nations freest from Bondage when they are freest from Oaths of Distinction and while they continue I shall never esteem the Union as perfect in all its parts to have made new ones here therefore would have been a Step to prevent or at least delay that more Christian Union of Hearts and Affections among all the Subjects of  Britain  which all wise Men wish and good Men pray for  FINIS
