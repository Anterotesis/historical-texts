 THE  GOTHAM  ELECTION A FARCE  By Mrs  CENTLIVRE  Quirites  Defossa in Loculis quos sportula fecit Amicos  Juv Sat  LONDON  Printed and Sold by S KEIMER at the  PrintingPress  in  PaterNosterRow    TO JAMES CRAGGS Jun  Esq  Cofferer to His Royal Highness the Prince of  Wales  and Member of the Honourable House of Commons  SIR  Do me the Honour to afford your Protection to these two  Petites  Pieces I am sure none ever stood in more need of so generous a Friend and a Defender  as you are tho' I dare not say they deserve this Benefit by any real Merit of their own yet they have one Title to the Protection of all well natur'd People which is that they have Enemies undeserv'd and were persecuted by those that did not know 'em  If they had gone thro' a legal Course of Theatrical Justice tho' it might have been partial yet I should have submitted to it as others had done before me but to be prejudg'd and condemn'd unheard was harder Measure than any body else meets with at this time a Day  The  Election  which had the  Honour to pass your Approbation was objected against as a Party Matter I fancy both Sides will agree that there are unreasonable Heats and Extravagancies belonging to each of 'em which deserve to be expos'd laugh'd at and exploded by all true Lovers of their Country since by such Arts our Enemies find the way to poison our Constitution  For the other it was said there would be Offence taken at the exposing a  Popish Priest  Good God To what sort of People are we chang'd Are those worthy Gentlemen the Emissaries of our most avow'd and irreconcileable Enemy to  be treated with so much Tenderncss Is not their very Profession Treason in any Subject of  Great Britain  Have our Neighbours in  France  treated the Clergy of the Reform'd Religion with the same Regard But let that pass since they have their Friends and Advecates even here I hope I have some too it is not an unpardonable Sin with every Body to wish well to the Liberties and Religion of one's Country No Sir I assure my self you have Goodness enough to overlook a great many other Faults where you find an honest and disinterested Zeal for our present happy Constitution  YOU whose good Judgment ever engaged you on the right Side the Protestant Succession and the Interest of  Britain  YOU who scorn'd to herd with the Betrayers of your Country or raise your Fortunes on the Ruins of your Fellow Subjects YOU who so generously espous'd my Interest when you knew my Intention of dedicating to His Royal Highness then Duke of  Cambridge  will have the Goodness to protect a Woman who has no other Merit but her good Inclinations and perpetual Wishes for the Prosperity of the present Government These were Principles  which you know she was not asham'd of owning even when it was almost Criminal to pay any Marks of Respect to that Royal Family under which our Laws and our Liberties are now so happily secur'd  I wish Sir that you may find any thing in either of these little Comedies that may entertain you at some leisure Hour I know very well that your Time is at present too precious to be thrown away upon Trifles that House of Commons of which you are so worthy and so ornamental a Member have the noblest and greatest Task now lying before them the Vindication of our  Publick Honour to all  Europe  and the Extricating us out of such Difficulties as only one Sett of Men in the World could plunge us into but they will meet their Reward and You with those worthy Patriots engag'd with You will find yours in the Thanks of the present Age and the Blessings of that of Posterity  I might here expatiate on the many excellent Qualifications You are Master of did I not know it would be harder to obtain your Pardon for touching upon that Subject than for presuming to shrowd these little Pieces under the Protection of your Name besides I think  it needless at high Noon to tell the World that it is light since all that have Eyes must see the Day and all that have the Honour to know Mr  Craggs  knows his Character is above my Reach consequently would suffer from the Attempt of any Pen so weak as mine Therefore shall only beg Leave to subscribe with the profoundest Respect  Sir  Your most Oblig'd most Obedient and most Devoted humble Servant Susanna Centlivre  THE PREFACE  WHEN I writ this little  Farce  I was not without Hopes of having it represented on the Stage what I propos'd to my self was the Honour to show their Royal Highnesses the Manner of our Elections and entertain the Town with a Subject entirely new It has had the good Fortune to please several Persons of Distinction and Taste in the Reading and some of our best Judges assur'd me it cou'd not fail to entertain from the Stage but the Subject being upon Elections the Master of the Revels did not care to meddle with it and the Players act nothing without his Licence so that I  had given over all Thoughts of its appearing in Publick But the Word  Election  it seems immediately furnish'd out a Thousand scandalous Stories and I was become the Subject of every CoffeeHouse in Town and notwithstanding my Friends endeavour'd to do me Justice as often as they heard me aspers'd yet for my clearer Justification they were of Opinion I ought to print it since several Persons had been so industriously malicious as to report that this  Farce  was a most impudent notorious Libel upon her Late Majesty than which there is nothing more false and the World will see how little Ground there is for such a Report its so far from being a Satyr upon her that there is not one personal Reflection design'd thro' the whole Piece I was oblig'd indeed to make an Opposition of Parties to heighten the Humour it had been impossible to have writ any Thing upon the Subject without it but I dare be positive that the  Persons among whom the Scenes lie wou'd have given more Diversion than Offence to the Spectators of either Party I endeavour'd to make every Thing appear as natural as I cou'd and for that Reason only I stuck Wool in the Hats of my  Whigs  and Lawrel in those of the  Tories  tho' I wou'd be glad to know why the latter made use of the Lawrel to dislinguish themselves when they were labouring to give up all the Conquests we had won I should have thought a Sprig of Rosemary had been the properer Emblem of the then approaching Funeral of our Church and State since the  Chevalier's  Friends were endeavouring to bury our Religion and Liberty under Tyranny and Popish Superstition Had Parliaments been Part of the Legislature among the Ancients and our Manner of Elections known to and practis'd by them  Apollo  wou'd certainly have shown Vengance on the unworthy Wearers of his favourite Tree  The Lawrel was ever held the Emblem of Joy and Reward of Vertue Hence it was worn by Victors in the  Olympick Games  but have  Englishmen  Reason to rejoyce in those Measures that pav'd the Way for a  French  Government and a  Popish  King  The  Roman  Soldiers who followed their Triumphs were crown'd with Lawrel to denote an Expiation of the Blood which they had shed in the Wars but our Lawrelwearers can draw no Parellel from thence except deserting our Allies selling our Trade disgracing our Generals giving up those glorious Conquests they had won deserv'd to be crown'd with Lawrel or that they wou'd be thought to wear it as an Expiation of the Blood of the  Catalans  and of the Twelve Thousand cut to Pieces at  Denain  by the fatal Cessation of Arms  Whatever Reason they had for wearing  it I am glad they had not an Opportunity of making use of it in the Triumph they design'd over the Laws and Liberties of their Country  Here I can't omit taking notice how much the Popish Faction encreased under the traiterous Management of the late Ministry and we see by their daily Insults that 'tis at the hazard of Life or Interest at least that we dare vindicate our Religion and Liberty Had the Author of Lady  Jane Grey  made her a Papist and  Gardiner  a Bishop of the Church of  England  and the Play been represented on the  French  Stage what Protestant would have dar'd to call it a  Popish Play  without running the Danger of the Gallies If the Title of a certain Monarch who was also set up by the People in Opposition to the Right Line were to be represented on the Theatre of  France  not even the first Peer of that Nation durst to have vented one Murmur much less his without he were furnish'd with Philosophy  enough to endure the  Bastile  and yet the Papists and their Abettors dare to do it here It is with the utmost Indignation that I see those wholsome Laws neglected which ought to be put in Execution against such profess'd Enemies of our Church and State for to the Indolence of our People in Power are all our present Divisions and Distractions owing tho' for the Author of that excellently writ Poem abovemention'd I dare answer for him is under no Concern for any Thing that Faction can either say or write since 'tis very evident their Malice is not levell'd against him but against our Religion and Liberties which he has in that Piece vindicated so well and set the Cruelties of  Rome  in so true a Light that a great Part of our Clergy may blush to see the Stage become a better Advocate for  Protestantism  than the Pulpit and as oft as that Tragedy shall be represented the Author's Memory shall be honoured to Posterity whilst those Pretenders to the Church the  HighFlying  and  NonjuringParty  shall be remembred with the utmost Detestation  Dramatis Personae  MEN  Tlckup  a

Alderman  Ha ha ha I can but laugh to think how my Wife's Brother the Mayor has overreach'd his Daughter  Enter  Sir  Roger Trusty  Sir Roger  Mr Alderman  Credulous  your most humble Servant Sir I'm glad to see you so merry Pray what may be the Occasion  Ald  Family Affairs Sir  Roger  my Brother has dispos'd of his Daughterthat's all  Sir Rog  Humph not as he expected tho' I believe for her Advantage I hope  Aside  Ald  Ay ay Sir  Roger  we Fathers know what's good for our Children better than they do themselves they have nought to do but to submit to our Pleasures Passive Obedience is as absolutely necessary in our Wives and Children as in Subjects to the Monarch is not your Opinion the same Sir  Roger    Sir Rog  Yes whilst Husbands Fathers and Monarchs exact nothing from us contrary to our Religion and Laws But pray Mr  Alderman  How came you so passive I remember you wore other Principles in Eighty Eightthis is not natural  Alderman  Ald  Eighty Eight that's a long time ago I know some Men that have worn out twenty Setts of Principles since Eighty Eight both Men of the Robe and Men of the Gown  Sir Rog  More the pity  Alderman  I am sorry Nature did not distinguish Men of such Principles from the rest of her Handywork  that we might enjoy her Gifts more amply and be more thankful for the Blessings When I reflect that I am of the same Species with the Betrayers of my Country for sure that Crime is the greatest of all others I could almost wish to wear any other Form of the Creation Life is a Blessing or a Curse according to the Fame we purchase and he that redeems twenty of his Fellow Creatures from the slavish Yoke of Tyranny does an Action worthy of a Man that bears the Image of his Creator whilst he who seeks by Treachery to inslave his Kind to feed Ambition Avarice or Revenge is only the Pest of human Society and ought to have a Mark set upon him that we might shun him as we would the Plague  Ald  Ay ay so it ought to be Sir  Roger  but I have read somewhere  Nature to Man's Breast has made no Windows  To show us what they act within Doors  For my part I am for the Church and my Country  Sir Rog  So am I their Interests are inseparable who gives up one betrays the others For my part I intend to stand or fall by both therefore I hope you'll do me the Honour of your Vote Mr  Alderman  Ald  Why truly Sir  Roger  I am preengag'd I won't tell a Lie for the Matter  Sir Rog  To who pray  Ald  Why to Squire  Tickup  Sir Rog  Tickup  Why he's a Fellow not worth a Groat and a known  Jacobite  Ald  Nay look ye as that his Means and his Religion is nothing to me let his Creditors take care of one and our Parson o' th' t'other for my part I'm for the Church as I said before and would rather be a Papist than a Presbyterian  Sir Rog  Why where's the Necessity of your being either Come come there's a more convincing Argument than what you have nam'dMr  Tickup  is recommended by some great Man on whom you have Dependance  Ald  Great Man Why yes truly he is a pretty large Man and I have I trust Heaven very great Dependance on what he says The Parson of the Parish you know ought to be regarded Sir  Roger  and he told me that Mr  Tickup  was a good Churchman and pray'd me to vote for him and to get all my Friends to do the same if I would promote the Interest of the Church  Sir Rog  Ay the Interest of the Church of  Rome  not that of  England  why I'll undertake to prove this Fellow deep in the Interest of young  Perkin  and that he and his Friend at  Villa Coumbe  has bought up and sent for his Service more than Horses within these last four Years and can such a Man be a proper Person to represent you in that August  Assembly where the People of  Gotham  expect to have these pernicious Measures redrest  Ald  Why I am confounded at what you tell me  Sir Rog  I am amaz'd to find you in the Interest of the HighBoys you that are a Cloathier What can you be for giving up Trade to  France  and starving poor Weavers  Ald  Trade pish pish our Parson says that's only the Whigs Cant and that if the Bill of Commerce had pass'd it wou'd have been of signal Service to us  Sir Rog  Which Way I pray Alderman  Ald  Nay I never askt him that tho' no Doubt but he can tell you for he is a learn'd Man and understands Matters better than I do  Sir Rog  It is much to be wish'd for the Honour of our Religion and the Safety of our State that those learned Men were more industrious in the Cure of Souls and less busie in PoliticksBut come come Mr  Alderman  there is yet a Secret behind the Curtain Pray what cou'd Mr  Tickup  or any of his Friends oblige you with that is not in my Power to have doneYou and I have been good Friends and if a Brace of Hundreds had been wantingwhy we cou'd have serv'd you as well as they  Ald  So so I find whereabouts you are  already Well there is nothing kept a Secret in this damn'd Town However I had not those Two Hundred Pounds by Way of Bribe I assure you Sir  Roger  Sir Rog  Ha ha why then you had Two Hundred Pounds  Ald  Yes I confess Mr  Blowcoal  our Parson did give me Bills for Two Hundred Pounds Part of a Sum he said that was given him for charitable Uses and bad me dispose of it to proper Objects as I thought fit but not to bribe Votes I assure you  Sir Rog  No no no no 'twas to build Churches I suppose and reward Secret Merit ha ha ha ha but I am sorry for your Sake that they made their Payment in PaperPray let me see those Billswho are they upon  Ald  See them Aythere they are Sir  Roger  Gives him Bills  Sir Rog  Looks on 'em  Upon Sir  Charles Wealthy  As I suspectedWhy he is a Bankrupt not worth a Groat ha ha ha why you are bit Alderman  Bloucoal  has bit you ha ha ha Charity quotha Yes this is Charity with a Vengance  Ald  How Am I trick'd But you are not in Earnest Sir  Roger  are you  Sir Rog  As certainly as that I my self lost Five hundred Pound by the same Banker I tell you Sir  C  arles Wealthy  has been gone off this Month  Ald  The Devil he has Odsheart I am finely serv'd why I'm out of Pocket the Lord knows what Death I shall lose all Patience  Sir Rog  Look ye Mr  Alderman  if you'll yet hear Reason I'll make up all this Matter see here  pulls out a Purse  here's Guine as in this Purse all ready Cash hang Paper here's the best Provision for charitable UsesMr  Alderman  hark how religiously they Chink what say you Will you cheat them as they have cheated you Come for once serve your self and your Country old Boy  Ald  But are you sure those Bills are not worth a Farthing Sir  Roger      Sir  Roger claps the Bills into his Pockets and takes out some Papers and tears 'em in small Piece  Sir Rog  Sure on't aye as sure as I am that my Name is  Roger Trusly  and thus I sacrifice them to your Resentment Mr  Alderman  and now  Ald  Death Hell and the Devil I'm undonebut if I'm not reveng'd  Sir Roger  Plays with the Purse  It was a cursed Trick inded to affront an Alderman of a Corporation at this rate  Ald  Give me the Purse  Sir Roger slaps it into his Hand  and now Sir  Roger  I am yours if I do not fit Parson  Blow Coal  say I am the Son of a dead CinderI'll bring Sixteen  Votes Sir  Roger  egad I'll overreach the Rogues I warrant 'em This Purse is a Pledge for my Performance  Exit  Sir Rog  And these Bills a Pledge for that Purse Ha ha ha  takes out the Bills  I'll send my Servant to receive the Money immediately I think I have paid them in their own Coin  In this at last we have the Advantage got  We give the Treat but they shall pay the Shot  SCENE  Mallets  Son's House  Mallet  his Son
