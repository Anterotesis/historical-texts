 Mr  ROWE  's POEMS  Price  s  POEMS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS  By  N ROWE  Esq  LONDON  Printed for E CURLL at the Dial and Bible against St  Dunstan  's Church in  Fleetstreet    POEMS ON Several Occasions  An EPISTLE to  FLAVIA On the Sight of two Pindarick Odes on the  Spleen  and  Vanity  Written by a Lady her Friend  FLAVIA to you with Safety I commend  This Verse the secret Failing of your Friend  To your Goodnature I securely trust  Who know that to Conceal is to be just  The Muse like wretched Maids by Love undone  From Friends Acquaintance and the Light would run  Conscious of Folly fears attending Shame  Fears the censorious World and Loss of Fame  Some Confident by chance she finds tho' few  Pity the Fools whom Love or Verse undo  Whose fond Compassion sooths her in the Sin  And sets her on to venture once again▪  SURE in the better Ages of old Time  Nor Poetry nor Love was thought a Crime  From Heav'n they both the Gods best Gifts were sent  Divinely perfect both and Innocent  Then were bad Poets and loose Loves not known  None felt a Warmth which they might blush to own  Beneath cool Shades our happy Fathers lay  And spent in pure untainted Joys the Day  Artless their Loves artless their Numbers were  While Nature simply did in both appear  Nor could the Censor or the Critick fear  Pleas'd to be pleas'd they took what Heaven bestow'd  Nor were too curious of the given Good  At length like  Indians  fond of fancy'd Toys  We lost being happy to be thought more wise  In one curst  ge to punish Verse and Sin  Criticks and Hangmen both at once came in  Wit and the Laws had both the same ill Fate  And partial Tyrants sway'd in either State  Then a lewd Tide of Verse with vicious Rage  Broke in upon the Morals of the Age  The Stage whose Art was once the Mind to move  To Noble Daring and to Virtuous Love  Precept with Pleasure mixt no more profest  But dealt in doublemeaning Bawdy Jest  The shocking Sounds offend the blushing Fair  And drive 'em from the guilty Theatre  Ye wretched Bards from whom these Ills have sprung  Whom the avenging Pow'rs have spar'd too long  Well may you fear the Blow will surely come  Your  Sodom  has no  Ten  t' avert its Doom  Unless the Fair ARDELIA will alone  To Heav'n for all the guilty Tribe atone  Nor can  Tou Saints  do more than such a  One  Since she alone of the Poetick Crowd▪  To the false Gods of Wit has never bow'd  The Empire which she saves shall own her Sway  And all  Parnassus  her blest Laws obey  SAY from what Sacred Fountain Nymph Divine  The Treasures flow which in thy Verse do shine  With what strange Inspiration art thou blest  What more than  Delphic  Ardor warms thy Breast  Our sordid Earth ne'er bred so bright a Flame  But from the Skies thy Kindred Skies it came  To Numbers great like thine th'Angelick Quire  In Joyous Consort tune the Golden Lyre  Viewing with pitying Eyes our Care's with thee  They wisely own that  All is Vanity  Ev'n all the Joys which mortal Minds can know  And find ARDELIA'S Verse the least vain thing below  IF PINDAR'S Name to those blest Mansions reach  And Mortal Muses may Immortal teach  In Verse like His the Heav'nly Nation raise  Their tuneful Voices to their Maker's Praise  Nor shall Celestial Harmony disdain  For once to imitate an Earthly Strain  Whose Fame secure no Rival e're can fear  But those above and fair ARDELIA here  She who undaunted could his Raptures view  And with bold Wings his Sacred Heights persue  Safe thro' the  Dithyrambick  Stream she steer'd  Nor the rough Deep in all its Dangers fear'd  Not so the rest who with successless Pain  Th' unnavigable Torrent try'd in vain  So CLELIA leapt into the rapid Flood  While the  Etruscans  struck with Wonder stood  Amidst the Waves her rash Persuers dy'd  The matchless Dame could only stem the Tide  And gain the Glory of the farther Side  SEE with what Pomp the Antick Masque comes in  The various Forms of the Fantastick  Spleen  Vain empty Laughter howling Grief and Tears  False Joy bred by false Hope and falser Fears  Each Vice each Passion which pale Nature wears  In this odd monstrous  Medley  mixt appears  Like  Bays  his Dance confus'dly round they run  Statesman Coquet gay Fop  and  pensive Nun  Spectres  and  Heroes Husbands  and their  Wives  With  MoukishDrones  that dream away their Lives  Long have I labour'd with the dire Disease  Nor found but from ARDELIA's Numbers Ease  The dancing Verse runs thro' my sluggish Veins  Where Dull and Cold the frozen Blood remains  Pale Cares and anxious Thoughts give Way in haste  And to returning Joy resign my Breast  Then free from ev'ry Pain I did endure  I bless the Charming Author of my Cure  So when to SAUL the great Musician play'd  The sullen Fiend unwillingly obey'd  And left the Monarch's Breast to seek some safer Shade  HORACE  Book  II  Ode  IV Imitated Ad XANTHIAM  Ne sit Ancillae tibi amor pudori  The Lord  G  to the E of  S    I  DO not most fragrant Earl disclaim  Thy bright thy reputable Flame  To  Brgle  the Brown  But publickly espouse the Dame  And say GDthe Town  II  Full many Heroes fierce and keen  With Drabs have deeply smitten been  Although right good Commanders  Some who with you have  Hounslow  seen  And some who've been in  Flanders  III  DID not base  Greber  's  Seigniora  Francesca Marguareta de l'Epine  an  Italian  Songstress  PEGG inflame  The sober Earl of  Nm  Of sober Sire descended  That careless of his Soul and Fame  To PlayHouses he nightly came  And left Church undefended  IV  The Monarch who of  France  is Hight  Who rules the Roast with matchless Might  Since WILLIAM went to Heaven  Loves MAINTENON his Lady bright  Who was but SCARRON'S Leaving  V  Tho' thy Dear's Father kept an Inn  At grisly Head of  aracen  For Carriers at  Northampton  Yet she might come of gentler Kin  Than e'er that Father dreamt on  VI  Of Proffers large her Choice had she  Of Jewels Plate and Land in Fee▪  Which she with Scorn rejected  And can a Nymph so virtuous be  Of baseborn Blood suspected  VII  Her dimple Cheek and roguish Eye  Her slender Waste and taper Thigh  I always thought provoking  But faith tho' I talk waggishly  I mean no more than Joking  VIII  Then be not Jealous Friend for why  My Lady Marchioness is nigh  To see I ne'er shall hurt ye  Besides you know full well that I  Am turn'd of f  e and Forty  HORACE  Book  III  Ode  IX Imitated Ad LYDIAM  Donec gratus eram  Tons  WHILE at my House in  Fleetstreet  once you lay  How merrily dear Sir Time pass'd away  While I partook your Wine your Wit and Mirth  I was the happiest Creature on  Tonson  sen his Dialect  God's  Yearth  Congreve  WHILE in your early Days of Reputation  You for blue Garters had not such a Passion  While yet you did not use as now your Trade is  To drink with noble Lords and toast their Ladies  Thou JACOB TONSON wert to my conceiving  The chearfullest best honest Fellow living  Tonson  I'M in with Captain VANBRUGH at the present  A most  sweetnatur'd  Gentleman and pleasant  He writes your Comedies draws Schemes and Models  And builds Dukes Houses upon very oddHills  For him so much I dote on him that I  If I was sure to go to Heaven would die  Congreve  TEMPLE and DALAVAL are now my Party  Men that are  tàm Mercurio  both  quàm Marte  And tho' for them I shall scarce go to Heaven  Yet I can drink with them six Nights in seven  Tonson  WHAT if from VAN'S dear Arms I should retire  And once more warm my  Bunnians  at your Fire  If I to  Bowstreet  should invite you home  And set a Bed up in my DiningRoom  Tell me dear Mr CONGREVE Would you come  Congreve  THO' the gay Sailor and the gentle Knight  Were Ten times more my Joy and Heart's Delight  Tho' civil Persons they you ruder were  And had more Humours than a dancing Bear  Yet for your sake I'd bid 'em  oth adieu  And live and die dear COB with only you  HORACE  Book  III  Ode  XXI Ad AMPHORAM  O Nata mecum consule Manlio  I  HAIL gentle Cask whose venerable Head  With hoary Down and ancient Dust o'erspread  Proclaim that since the Vine first brought Thee forth  Old Age has added to thy Worth  Whether the sprightly Juice thou dost contain  Thy Vot'ries will to Wit and Love  Or senseless Noise and Lewdness move  Or Sleep the Cure of these and ev'ry other Pain  II  Since to some Day propitious and great  Justly at first thou wast design'd by Fate  This Day the happiest of thy many Years  With thee I will forget my Cares  To my CORVINU'S Health thou shalt go round  Since thou art ripen'd for to Day  And longer Age would bring Decay  Till ev'ry anxious Thought in the rich Stream be drown'd  III  To thee my Friend his Roughness shall submit▪  And SOCRATES himself a while forget  Thus when old CATO wou'd sometimes unbend  The rugged Stiffness of his Mind  Stern and severe the Stoic quaff'd his Bowl  His frozen Virtue felt the Charm  And soon grew pleas'd and soon grew warm  And blest the sprightly Pow'r that chear'd his gloomy Soul  IV  With kind Constraint ill Nature thou dost bend  And mold the snarling Cynic to a Friend  The Sage reserv'd and fam'd for Gravity  Finds all he knows summ'd up in thee  And by thy Pow'r unlock'd grows easy gay and free  The Swain who did some credulous Nymph perswade  To grant him all inspir'd by thee  Devotes her to his Vanity  And to his fellow Fops toasts the abandon'd Maid  V  The Wretch who press'd beneath a Load of Cares  And lab'ring with continual Woes despairs  If thy kind Warmth does his chill'd Sense invade  From Earth he rears his drooping Head  Reviv'd by thee he ceases now to mourn  His flying Cares give way to haste  And to the God resign his Breast  Where Hopes of better Days and better Things return  VI  The lab'ring Hind who with hard Toyl and Pains  Amidst his Wants a wretched Life maintains  If thy rich Juice his homely Supper crown  Hot with thy Fires and bolder grown  Of Kings and of their Arbitrary Pow'r▪  And how by impious Arms they reign  Fiercely he talks with rude Disdain  And vows to be a Slave to be a Wretch no more  VII  Fair Queen of Love and thou great God of Wine  Hear ev'ry Grace and all ye Pow'rs Divine  All that to Mirth and Friendship do incline  Crown this auspicious Cask and happy Night  With all things that can give Delight  Be every Care and anxious Thought away  Ye Tapers still be bright and clear  Rival the Moon and each pale Star  Your Beams shall yield to none but his who brings the Day  HORACE  Book  IV  Ode  Ad VENEREM  Intermissa Venus diu  Rursus bella moves  ONce more the Queen of Love invades my Breast  Late with long Ease and peaceful Pleasures blest  Spare spare the Wretch that still has been thy Slave  And let my former Service have  The Merit to protect me to the Grave  Much am I chang'd from what I once have been  When under CYNARA good and fair  With Joy I did thy Fetters wear  Blest in the gentle Sway of an indulgent Queen  II  Stiff and unequal to the Labour now  With Pain my Neck beneath thy Yoak I bow  Why dost thou urge me still to bear Oh why  Dost thou not much rather fly  To youthful Breasts to Mirth and Gaiety  Go bid thy Swans their glossy Wings expand  And swiftly thro' the yielding Air  To SYLVIA Thee their Goddess bear  Worthy to be Thy Slave and fit for thy Command  III  Noble and graceful witty gay and young  Joy in his Heart Love on his charming Tongue  Skill'd in a thousand soft prevailing Arts  With wondrous Force the Youth imparts  Thy Pow'r to unexperienc'd Virgins Hearts  Far shall he stretch the Bounds of thy Command  And if thou shalt his Wishes bless  Beyond his Rivals with Success  In Gold and Marble shall thy Statues stand  IV  Beneath the Sacred Shade of  Odel  's Wood  Or on the Banks of  Ouse  's gentle Flood  With od'rous Beams a Temple he shall raise  For ever sacred to thy Praise  Till the fair Stream and Wood and Love it self decays  There while rich Incense on Thy Altar burns  Thy Votaries the Nymphs and Swains  In melting soft harmonious Strains  Mixt with the softer Flutes shall tell their Flames by turns  V  As Love and Beauty with the Light are born  So with the Day thy Honours shall return  Some lovely Youth pair'd with a blushing Maid  A Troop of either Sex shall lead  And twice the  Salian  Measures round thy Altar tread  Thus with an equal Empire o'er the Light  The Queen of Love and God of Wit  Together rise together sit  But Goddess do thou stay and bless alone the Night  VI  There mayst thou reign while I forget to love  No more false Beauty shall my Passion move  Nor shall my fond believing Heart be led  By mutual Vows and Oaths betray'd  To hope for Truth from the protesting Maid  With Love the sprightly Joys of Wine are sled  The Roses too shall wither now  That us'd to shade and crown my Brow  And round my chearful Temples fragrant Odours shed  VII  But tell me CYNTHIA say bewitching Fair  What mean these Sighs Why steals this falling Tear  And when my strugling Thoughts for Passage strove  Why did my Tongue refuse to move  Tell me can this be any thing but Love  Still with the Night my Dreams my Griefs renew  Still she is present to my Eyes  And still in vain I as she flies  O'er Woods and Plains and Seas the scornful Maid persue  HORACE  Book  I  Epist  IV Ad ALBIUM TIBULLUM  ALBI  nostrorum sermonum candide judex  Inscribed to R THORNHILL  Esq  THORNHILL whom doubly to my Heart commend  The Critick's Art and Candour of a Friend  Say what thou dost in thy Retirement find  Worthy the Labours of thy active Mind  Whether the Tragick Muse inspires thy Thought  To emulate what moving OTWAY wrote  Or whether to the Covert of some Grove  Thou and thy Thoughts do from the World remove  Where to thy self thou all those Rules dost show  That Good Men ought to practise or Wise know  For sure thy Mass of Man is no dull Clay  But well inform'd with the Celestial Ray  The bounteous Gods to thee compleatly kind  In a fair Frame inclos'd thy fairer Mind  And tho' they did profusely Wealth bestow  They gave thee the true Use of Wealth to know  Cou'd ev'n the Nurse wish for her darling Boy  A Happiness which thou dost not enjoy  What can her fond Ambition ask beyond  A Soul by Wisdom's noblest Precepts crown'd  To this fair Speech and happy Utterance join'd  To unlock the secret Treasures of the Mind  And make the Blessing common to Mankind  On these let Health and Reputation wait  The Favour of the Virtuous and the Great  A Table cheerfully and cleanly spread  Stranger alike to Riot and to Need  Such an Estate as no Extreams may know  A free and just Disdain for all things else below  Amidst uncertain Hopes and anxious Cares  Tumultuous Strife and miserable Fears  Prepare for all Events thy constant Breast  And let each Day be to Thee as thy last  That Morning's Dawn will with new Pleasure rise  Whose Light shall unexpected bless thy Eyes  Me when to Town in Winter you repair  Batt'ning in Ease you'll find sleek fresh and fair  Me who have learnt from EPICURUS Lore  To snatch the Blessings of the flying Hour  Whom every  Friday  at the  Vine  you'll find  His true Disciple and your faithful Friend  UNIO  DUM  Rosa  purpureo
