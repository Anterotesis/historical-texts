 FUGITIVE PIECES  coacta prodire  WRITTEN BY J P KEMBLE  YORK PRINTED BY W BLANCHARD AND CO FOR THE AUTHOR AND SOLD BY FIELDING AND WALKER LONDON AND T WILSON AND SON AND N FROBISHER YORK MDCCLXXX  PREFACE  I Declare I hardly know how to say what justice to myself obliges me to sayThe public hears daily of so many unlucky Poets who become publishers from the same fate that ranges me in their class that I am apprehensive the truth when told will not serve me as an apology but the effect of constraint be reputed the wish of presumption  The course of my studies first gave me a taste for Poetry and the sweetness of the art inspired me with an inclination to improve itThe few who saw my verses  said they liked them and would sometimes ask for a copy of what they had seenThe first pleasure I know is to please and indeed I thought complying with their requests an easy return for the obligation of their praiseThey had copies and in their high opinion of me gave copies to others who soon circulated some of my pieces as particular favours to particular friends through half a dozen editions of which three or four were generally very incorrect  To prevent this evil from spreading I have here collected in one small book those verses of which I have ever given  copies as far as remembrance and possession have permitted me  All parents have a partiality to their own childso every Writer has a partiality to the productions of his own brain that would rather they were seen in a perfect than an imperfect situation and when a man's writings must unavoidably be delivered into the hands of the public a decent respect for his own character and good manners to his fellowcreatures will oblige him to endeavour as much as possiible that they may not excite a contempt for himself nor be entirely useless and disgusting to his readers  YORK    FUGITIVE PIECES  HEBE's BIRTHDAY  ADDRESSED TO Miss  THE Queen of Paphos' flow'ry groves  Ascends her doveborne car  Cupid  the  Graces  and the  Loves  Shed odours thro' the air  Soon  Cytherea  reach'd the skies  Each God that day was there  She rais'd to  Jove  her wat'ry eyes  And thus prefer'd her pray'r  "No more mankind invokes my pow'r  "Nor ardent vows arise  "From doting bosoms love's no more  "My  Cupid's  influence dies  "His bow his arrows he has thrown  "Quite useless from his arms  "See where the Sister  Graces  moan  "In negligence of charms  "Today springs forth to life below  "A Babe of honour'd line  "There let each God some boon bestow  "And stamp the Nymph divine"  She spoke  Jove  gave th'assenting nod  His thunders took their way  He then commanded that each God  The Queen of Love obey  First came the  Graces  hand in hand  And gave her all their ease  O'er ev'ry heart supreme command  And elegance to please  Apollo  and the  Muses  Nine  Their heav'nly gifts impart  Wit music poesy divine  And sense to form the heart  Jove  gave his light'ning to her eyes  Gav  Bacchus  lasting youth  Momus  with laughter shook the skies  And added smiling truth  Cupid  heard allbut knew not how  The sky's applause to gain  Till in her smiles he spy'd his bow  And bad it there remain  Venus  transported saw the Maid  And her delight to prove  Cupid attend on her she said  For Hebe's Queen of Love  MAY  HOW joyful the goldentress'd God thro' the sky  Diffuses his allforming ray  See the temperate hours as round him they fly  Drop roses to crown the new May  Each manyplum'd songster that lives in yon grove  Gives voice to his greenkirtled spray  And when he pours forth the soft tale of his love  Concludes with a sonnet to May  The brooks that sweet vi'lets and thyme flow among  Their babbling course wantonly stay  Till hearing the chorus of Nature's glad song  They purl on in honour of May  Nor let me forget while enraptur'd I sing  The honour that's due to this day  To heighten the transports I taste in the Spring  I'll make Hebe Queen of the May  THE WISH  ARchlysmiling dimpled Boy  Son of  Venus  God of Love  Grant my heart the seat of joy  May thy temple ever prove  Let me sing and laugh all day  Sweetly pass my nights away  Then arising taste with you  Blessings lasting Raptures new  HEBE  LOOK to my lambkinsonce again  Daphnis shall try the Sylvan strain  And fetch me boy the fav'rite pipe I hung  Lovelorn on yonder elm it oft has rung  In happier days  With Hebe's praise  Till vallies and hills and the woods all around  To yon river in concert reecho'd the sound  Which lovefreighted bore the name  Far adown his winding stream  Repeating it with fond delay  While from bank to bank the joy  Spread tillWhere's my pipe my boy  Till like my hopes alas it dy'd away  Why do I sigh  Dost know my pipeNowspeakI've caught the sound  That lifts me high  That bids me run my wonted careless round  Bids me again to kinder fair one's rove  And  Hebe  leave who slights my proffer'd love  THE INCONSTANT  ARound the plain secure I rov'd  With ev'ry nymph wou'd toy  Wou'd laugh and kissbut never lov'd  Beyond the moment's joy  Cupid resolv'd to snare my heart  Each blooming Beauty tries  But sent the loveinspiring dart  From Hebe's sparkling eyes  Since then I've lov'dbut lov'd in vain  Gay grandeur charms my fair  She scorns my sighsAh Iucklessswain  Thy portion is despair  SALLY OF THE MEAD  ONE morn when nymphs and swains were gay  And danc'd upon the green  From mirth poor  Jemmy  fled away  To mourn his lot unseen  In tears the am'rous Boy complains  Close by the murm'ring Tweed  The sad sad burthen of his strains  Was  Sally  of the Mead  My  Sally  did each nymph surpass  Who trips the flow'ry plain  Once she was thought the loveliest lass  And I the happiest swain  To please her was my sole employ  To her I tun'd my reed  And morn and eve my only joy  Was  Sally  of the Mead  While yet the morn was clad in grey  I rose to court her love  Thro' flow'ry fields I took my way  And then her garland wove  Tho' Rose and Lily both were there  To deck her charming head  That was less sweet and this less fair  Than  Sally  of the Mead  Now she no more shall glad my eyes  No more my song inspire  From me the faithless fair one flies  To bless the richer 'Squire  Yet may her heart know nought but joy  Nor e'er repent this deed  Jemmy  can lay him downand die  For  Sally  of the Mead  ODE AD SOMNUM  QUEM

faithful Love should love in vain  A PICTURE OF HELEN  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LADY  REpentant  Helen  sought the silent shade  And wept to think what ruin she had made  Reflection shews a Husband's injur'd peace  Hears the deep carses of unpeopled  Greece  Points to the story of her ruin'd fame  And future ages shudd'ring at her name  Lovely in guilt the great Adult'ress stood  Saw  Phrygia's  plains imbru'd with  Hector's  blood  Saw the slain Partner of her lawless joy  A murder'd  Priam  and a slaming  Troy  She heav'd a groan and clos'd her tearstain'd eye  Lest she might see the  Grecian  Heroes die  In vain  Patroclus  rises to her fight  Dress'd in the reddest horrors of the fight  Link'd with his friend the great  Achilles  rose  The tow'r of  Greece  and terror of her foes  Stern  Ajax  frown'd upon the gory field  Longing in death to grasp  Pelides  ' shield  Vainly she strives to put them from her mind  Her guilt hears groans in ev'ry whisp'ring wind  See plated  Mars  high on his crimson car  Laugh 'midst the spreading tumult of the war  Now sees the  Greeks  and now the  Trojans  fly  And hears one deathfraught thunder rend the sky  She heardand struck with horror at the scene  On earth's cold bosom sunk the hapless Queen  In duteous haste her virgin's round her press  Heave sigh for sigh and grieve for her distress  Anxious each balm to sooth her woes they seek  And bid its native roses tinge her cheek  Fruitless their careIn tears they raise her head  Where Lilies wept their sister Roses dead  Harkthe kind streamlet from the neighb'ring trees  In gentle murmurs chides the noisy breeze  The noisy breeze the sweet reproof obey'd  Beheld the Fair and dy'd along the glade  Behold her thou whose passions long to rove  Careless of honour and connubial love  And learn that though enamour'd of her charms  Her doating Lord had ta'en her to his arms  Again restor'd her to his bed and throne  And to the world acknowledg'd her his own  Yet not his pardon nor his throne combin'd  Cou'd ease the pangs that agoniz'd her mind  EPITAPHIUM  SISTE viator  Hic sepulta jacent ossa  JOSEPHI INCHBALD HISTRIONIS  Qui aequalium suorum  In Fictis

lov'd than thine  THE CIRCASSIAN  To Miss  JOVE  lately took it in his head  To give the Gods a masquerade  And sent his footman  Hermes  out  With Cards to ask them to the rout  Iris  a milliner of taste  Handbills sent forth thro' Heav'n in haste  To tell the Goddesses she'd laid in  Fresh goods against the masquerading  The Ladies all were in a pother  And hoping each to outvie t'other  Bade her make up their silks and laces  Venus  employ'd the Sister Graces  Who all agreed Love's Queen should dress  As a CIRCASSIAN Shepherdess  The Graces always fancy well  Quick to their work the Sisters fell  Finish'd it in a day or two  Try'd it on  Venus  and withdrew  Who beg'd them first with earnest pray'r  To come next day and dress her hair  Then in her kirtle tripp'd about  And soon with this or that fell out  Till vex'd to death young  Cupid  cries  "You Ladies are such oddities  "I'm sure Mama you quite mistake it  "It fits as neat as hands can make it  "There's not a single thread amiss"  She smil'dand gave the Boy a kiss  When bolder grown by  Slyx  he swore  "She ne'er look'd half so well before"  To bed she wentthought all was right  But cou'd n't sleep a wink that night  Next ev'ning came the Graces three  And  Venus  had 'em in to tea  In greatones nothing shews so well  As 'haviour kind and affable  Wellafter pitying the Moon  For tripping with  Endymion  And calling royal  Juno  scold  And twenty harmless tales o'ertold  Says  Venus  looking at her watch  "Ladies egad we must dispatch  "For seeit's almost nine o'clock  "Euphrosyne  come smooth this lock    "Pasithea  reach my dressing gown  "  Thalia  take my toupée down  "And let its ringlets kiss my head  "Loose as when on wat'ry bed  "In smiles I woke to life divine  "And here and there a rose entwine  "Adown that braid"Says Miss" I doubt it  "Won't look so well as 'twould without it  "These threads of gold""I will have one  "Miss Grace you know it's quite the Ton"  So it is possible we see  That Ton and Grace may disagree  Her locks ethereal now were drest  "Come bring me my Circassian vest"  "Where is it Ma'am"I'th' middle drawer"  Pusithea wenther Sisters saw her  Turn paleshe cries "we're all undone"  "How so""Lord Ma'am the dress is gone"  The Graces sobbings can't be painted  Poor  Venus  only sigh'dand fainted  "Here reach the Hartshorn Drops" says one  "Fresh water" t'othert'other "run  "For  Esculapius"  "Greater need  "Of Doctor  Phaebus"  "He dont bleed  "Alas" cries one"and in this case  "She should be bled"Ay""Cut her lace"  Nothing was done of all they said  For each commanded none obey'd  Here  Cupid  with his playmate came  Soft  Ganymede  to see the Dame  For  Venus  knowing not a chair  That night in Heav'n wou'd be to spare  Nor coach for love or coin be had  Very politely told the Lad  That he should be her 'Squire and ride  That night with  Cupid  at her side  In her own chariot drawn by Doves  And lackied by a thousand Loves  Ent'ring her room the Fair they found  Rising recover'd from the ground  Arch  Cupid  looking earnest at her  Climb'd on her knee and "what's the matter  "Mama" says he"My pretty Boy  "My dress my pride my only joy  "Is gone is gone""Mama what dress"  "Why my new PERSIAN Shepherdess  "The best CIRCASSIAN prankt with pink  "Was it"Ay ay"The Graces wink  Gan  shook his head and  Venus  sigh'd  And roguish

CIRCASSIAN my sworn Brother  "Thinks so much lovelier than his Mother"  "Is that the Maid" says  Jove  "I find  "Our cousin  Cupid  is n't blind  "For tho' the Rogue forgot his duty  "Yet he's a perfect judge of Beauty"  FINIS
