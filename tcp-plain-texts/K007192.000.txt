 A Political Romance Addressed To    Esq  OF YORK To which is subjoined a KEY  Ridiculum acri  Fortius et melius magnas plerumque secat Res  YORK  Printed in the Year MDCCLIX Price ONE SHILLING  A POLITICAL ROMANCE  c  SIR  _IN my last for want of something better to write about I told you what a World of Fending and Proving we have had of late in this little Village of ours about an  oldcastPairofblackPlushBreeches  which  John  our ParishClerk about ten Years ago it seems had made a Promise of to one  Trim  who is our Sexton and DogWhipperTo this you write me Word that you have had more than either one or two Occasions to know a good deal of the shifty Behaviour of this said Master  Trim  and that  you are astonished nor can you for your Soul conceive how so worthless a Fellow and so worthless a Thing into the Bargain could become the Occasion of such a Racket as I have represented  Now though you do not say expressly you could wish to hear any more about it yet I see plain enough that I have raised your Curiosity and therefore from the same Motive that I slightly mentioned it at all in my last Letter I will in this give you a full and very circumstantial Account of the whole Affair  But before I begin I must first set you right in one very material Point in which I have missled you as to the true Cause of all this Uproar amongst uswhich does not take its Rise as I then told you from the Affair of the  Breeches  but on the contrary the whole Affair of the  Breeches  has taken its Rise from itTo understand which you must know that the first Beginning of the Squabble was not between  John  the ParishClerk and  Trim  the Sexton but betwixt the Parson of the Parish and the said Master  Trim  about an old  WatchCoat  which had many Years hung up in the Church which  Trim  had set his Heart upon and nothing would serve  Trim  but he must take it home in order to have it converted into a  warm UnderPetticoat  for his Wife and a  Jerkin  for himself against Winter which in a plaintive Tone he most humbly begg'd his Reverence would consent to  I need not tell you Sir who have so often felt it that a Principle of strong Compassion transports a generous Mind sometimes beyond what is strictly rightthe Parson was within an Ace of being an honourable Example of this very Crimefor no sooner did the distinct Words  Petticoatpoor WifewarmWinter  strike upon his Earbut his Heart warmedand before  Trim  had well got to the End of his Petition being a Gentleman of a frank and open Temper he told him he was welcome to it with all his Heart and Soul But  Trim  says he as you see I am but just got down to my Living and am an utter Stranger to all ParishMatters know nothing about this old WatchCoat you beg of me having never seen it in my  Life and therefore cannot be a Judge whether 'tis fit for such a Purpose or if it is in Truth know not whether 'tis mine to bestow upon you or notyou must have a Week or ten Days Patience till I can make some Inquiries about itand if I find it is in my Power I tell you again Man your Wife is heartily welcome to an UnderPetticoat out of it and you to a Jerkin was the Thing as good again as you represent it  It is necessary to inform you Sir in this Place That the Parson was earnestly bent to serve  Trim  in this Affair not only from the Motive of Generosity which I have justly ascribed to him but likewise from another Motive and that was by way of making some Sort of Recompence for a Multitude of small Services which  Trim  had occasionally done and indeed was continually doing as he was much about the House when his own Man was out of the Way For all these Reasons together I say the Parson of the Parish intended to serve  Trim  in this Matter to the utmost of his Power All that was wanting was previously to inquire if any one  had a  Claim  to itor whether as it had Time immemorial hung up in the Church the taking it down might not raise a Clamour in the Parish These Inquiries were the very Thing that  Trim  dreaded in his HeartHe knew very well that if the Parson should but say one Word to the ChurchWardens about it there would be an End of the whole Affair For this and some other Reasons not necessary to be told you at present  Trim  was for allowing no Time in this Matterbut on the contrary doubled his Diligence and Importunity at the VicarageHouseplagued the whole Family to Deathpressed his Suit Morning Noon and Night and to shorten my Story teazed the poor Gentleman who was but in an ill State of Health almost out of his Life about it  You will not wonder when I tell you that all this Hurry and Precipitation on the Side of Master  Trim  produced its natural Effect on the Side of the Parson and that was a Suspicion that all was not right at the Bottom  He was one Evening sitting alone in his Study weighing and turning this Doubt every Way in his Mind and after an Hour and a half's serious Deliberation upon the Affair and running over  Trim  's Behaviour throughouthe was just saying to himself  It must be so  when a sudden Rap at the Door put an End to his Soliloquyand in a few Minutes to his Doubts too for a Labourer in the Town who deem'd himself past his fiftysecond Year had been returned by the Constable in the MilitiaListand he had come with a Groat in his Hand to search the Parish Register for his AgeThe Parson bid the poor Fellow put the Groat into his Pocket and go into the KitchenThen shutting the Study Door and taking down the Parish Register  Who knows  says he  but I may find something here about this selfsame WatchCoat  He had scarce unclasped the Book in saying this when he popp'd upon the very Thing he wanted fairly wrote on the first Page pasted to the Inside of one of the Covers whereon was a Memorandum about the very Thing in Question in these express Words  MEMORANDUM  The great WatchCoat was purchased and given above two hundred Years ago by the Lord of the Manor to this ParishChurch to the sole Use and Behoof of the poor Sextons thereof and their Successors for ever to be worn up them respectively in winterly cold Nights in ringing  Complines PassingBells c  which the said Lord of the Manor had done in Piety to keep the poor Wretches warm and for the Good of his own Soul for which they were directed to pray  c c c c  Just Heaven  said the Parson to himself looking upwards  What an Escape have I had I Give this for an UnderPetticoat to  Trim  's Wife I would not have consented to such a Desecration to be Primate of all  England  nay I would not have disturb'd a single Button of it for half my Tythes  Scarce were the Words out of his Mouth when in pops  Trim  with the whole Subject of the Exclamation under both his ArmsI say under both his Armsfor he had actually got it ripp'd and cut out ready his own Jerkin under one Arm and the Petticoat under the other in order to be carried to the Taylor to be made up  and had just stepp'd in in high Spirits to shew the Parson how cleverly it had held out  There are many good Similies now subsisting in the World but which I have neither Time to recollect or look for which would give you a strong Conception of the Astonishment and honest Indignation which this unexpected Stroke of  Trim  's Impudence impress'd upon the Parson's LooksLet it suffice to say That it exceeded all fair Descriptionas well as all Power of proper Resentmentexcept this that  Trim  was ordered in a stern Voice to lay the Bundles down upon the Tableto go about his Business and wait upon him at his Peril the next Morning at Eleven preciselyAgainst this Hour like a wise Man the Parson had sent to desire  John  the ParishClerk who bore an exceeding good Character as a Man of Truth and who having moreover a pretty Freehold of about eighteen Pounds a Year in the Township was a leading Man in it and upon the whole was such a one of whom it might be saidThat he rather did Honour to his Officethan  that his Office did Honour to himHim he sends for with the ChurchWardens and one of the SidesMen a grave knowing old Man to be presentFor as  Trim  had withheld the whole Truth from the Parson touching the WatchCoat he thought it probable he would as certainly do the same Thing to others though this I said was wise the Trouble of the Precaution might have been sparedbecause the Parson's Character was unblemish'dand he had ever been held by the World in the Estimation of a Man of Honour and Integrity  Trim  's Character on the contrary was as well known if not in the World yet at least in all the Parish to be that of a little dirty pimping pettifogging ambidextrous Fellowwho neither cared what he did or said of any provided he could get a Penny by itThis might I say have made any Precaution needlessbut you must know as the Parson had in a Manner but just got down to his Living he dreaded the Consequences of the least ill Impression on his first Entrance amongst his Parishioners which would have disabled him from doing them the Good he wishedso that out of Regard to his Flock more than the  necessary Care due to himselfhe was resolv'd not to lie at the Mercy of what Resentment might vent or Malice lend an Ear toAccordingly the whole Matter was rehearsed from first to last by the Parson in the Manner I've told you in the Hearing of  John  the ParishClerk and in the Presence of  Trim  Trim  had little to say for himself except  "That the Parson had absolutely promised to be friend him and his Wife in the Affair to the utmost of his Power That the WatchCoat was certainly in his Power and that he might still give it him if he pleased"  To this the Parson's Reply was short but strong  "That nothing was in his  Power  to do but what he could do  honestly  That in giving the Coat to him and his Wife he should do a manifest Wrong to the  next  Sexton the great WatchCoat being the most comfortable Part of the PlaceThat he should moreover injure the Right of his own Successor who would be just so much a worse Patron as the Worth of the Coat amounted toand in  a Word he declared that his whole Intent in promising that Coat was Charity to  Trim  but  Wrong  to no Man that was a Reserve he said made in all Cases of this Kindand he declared solemnly  in Verbo Sacerdotis  That this was his Meaning and was so understood by  Trim  himself"  With the Weight of this Truth and the great good Sense and strong Reason which accompanied all the Parson said upon the Subjectpoor  Trim  was driven to his last Shiftand begg'd he might be suffered to plead his Right and Title to the WatchCoat if not by  Promise  at least by  Services  It was well known how much he was entitled to it upon these Scores That he had black'd the Parson's Shoes without Count and greased his Boots above fifty TimesThat he had run for Eggs into the Town upon all Occasionswhetted the Knives at all Hourscatched his Horse and rubbed him downThat for his Wife she had been ready upon all Occasions to charr for themand neither he nor she to the best of his Remembrance ever took a Farthing or any thing beyond a Mug of AleTo this Account of his Services he  begg'd Leave to add those of his Wishes which he said had been equally greatHe affirmed and was ready he said to make it appear by Numbers of Witnesses  "He had drank his Reverence's Health a thousand Times by the bye he did not add out of the Parson's own Ale That he not only drank his Health but wish'd it and never came to the House but ask'd his Man kindly how he did that in particular about half a Year ago when his Reverence cut his Finger in paring an Apple he went half a Mile to ask a cunning Woman what was good to stanch Blood and actually returned with a Cobweb in his Breeches PocketNay says  Trim  it was not a Fortnight ago when your Reverence took that violent Purge that I went to the far End of the whole Town to borrow you a Closestooland came back as my Neighbours who flouted me will all bear witness with the Pan upon my Head and never thought it too much"  Trim  concluded his pathetick Remonstrance with saying  "He hoped his Reverence's Heart would not suffer him to requite so many faithful Services by so unkind  a ReturnThat if it was so as he was the first so he hoped he should be the last Example of a Man of his Condition so treated"  This Plan of  Trim  's Defence which  Trim  had put himself uponcould admit of no other Reply but a general Smile  Upon the whole let me inform you That all that could be said  pro  and  con  on both Sides being fairly heard it was plain That  Trim  in every Part of this Affair had behaved very illand  one  Thing which was never expected to be known of him happening in the Course of this Debate to come out against himnamely That he had gone and told the Parson before he had ever set Foot in his Parish That  John  his ParishClerkhis ChurchWardens and some of the Heads of the Parish were a Parcel of ScoundrelsUpon the Upshot  Trim  was kick'd out of Doors and told at his Peril never to come there again  At first  Trim  huff'd and bounced most terriblyswore he would get a Warrantthen nothing would serve him but  he would call a ByeLaw and tell the whole Parish how the Parson had misused himbut cooling of that as fearing the Parson might possibly bind him over to his good Behaviour and for aught he knew might send him to the House of Correctionhe let the Parson alone and to revenge himself falls foul upon his Clerk who had no more to do in the Quarrel than you or Irips up the Promise of the oldcastPairofblackPlushBreeches and raises an Uproar in the Town about it notwithstanding it had slept ten YearsBut all this you must know is look'd upon in no other Light but as an artful Stroke of Generalship in  Trim  to raise a Dust and cover himself under the disgraceful Chastisement he has undergone  If your Curiosity is not yet satisfiedI will now proceed to relate the  Battle  of the Breeches in the same exact Manner I have done  that  of the WatchCoat  Be it known then that about ten Years ago when  John  was appointed ParishClerk of this Church this said Master  Trim  took no small Pains to get into  John  's  good Graces in order as it afterwards appeared to coax a Promise out of him of a Pair of Breeches which  John  had then by him of black Plush not much the worse for wearing  Trim  only begging for God's Sake to have them bestowed upon him when  John  should think fit to cast them  Trim  was one of those kind of Men who loved a Bit of Finery in his Heart and would rather have a tatter'd Rag of a Better Body's than the best plain whole Thing his Wife could spin him  John  who was naturally unsuspicious made no more Difficulty of promising the Breeches than the Parson had done in promising the Great Coat and indeed with something less Reservebecause the Breeches were  John's own  and he could give them without Wrong to whom he thought fit  It happened I was going to say unluckily but I should rather say most luckily for  Trim  for he was the only Gainer by itthat a Quarrel about some  six or eight Weeks after this broke out between  the late  Parson of the Parish and  John  the Clerk Somebody and it was thought to be Nobody but  Trim  had put it into the Parson's Head "That  John  's Desk in the Church was at the least four Inches higher than it should beThat the Thing gave Offence and was indecorous inasmuch as it approach'd too near upon a Level with the Parson's Desk itself This Hardship the Parson complained of loudlyand told  John  one Day after Prayers  "He could bear it no longerAnd would have it alter'd and brought down as it should be"  John  made no other Reply but  "That the Desk was not of his raisingThat 'twas not one Hair Breadth higher than he found itand that as he found it so would he leave itIn short he would neither make an Encroachment nor would he suffer one"  The  late  Parson might have his Virtues but the leading Part of his Character was not  Humility  so that  John  's Stiffness in this Point was not likely to reconcile MattersThis was  Trim  's Harvest  After a friendly Hint to  John  to stand his Groundaway hies  Trim  to make his Market at the VicarageWhat pass'd there I will not say intending not to be uncharitable so shall content myself with only guessing at it from the sudden Change that appeared in  Trim  's Dress for the betterfor he had left his old ragged Coat Hat and Wig in the Stable and was come forth strutting across the Churchyard y'clad in a good creditable cast Coat large Hat and Wig which the Parson had just given himHo Ho Hollo  John  cries  Trim  in an insolent Bravo as loud as ever he could bawlSee here my Lad how fine I amThe more Shame for you answered  John  seriouslyDo you think  Trim  says he such Finery gain'd by such Services becomes you or can wear wellFye upon it  Trim  I could not have expected this from you considering what Friendship you pretended and how kind I have ever been to youHow many Shillings and Sixpences I have generously lent you in your DistressesNay it was but t'other Day that I promised you these black Plush Breeches I have onRot your Breeches quoth  Trim  for  Trim  's Brain was half turn'd with his new FineryRot your Breeches says heI would not take them up were they laid at my Doorgive 'em and be d  d to you to whom you likeI would have you to know I can have a better Pair at the Parson's any Day in the Week  John  told him plainly as his Word had once pass'd him he had a Spirit above taking Advantage of his Insolence in giving them away to anotherBut to tell him his Mind freely he thought he had got so many Favours of that Kind and was so likely to get many more for the same Services of the Parson that he had better give up the Breeches with good Nature to some one who would be more thankful for them  Here  John  mentioned  Mark Slender  who it seems the Day before had ask'd  John  for 'em not knowing they were under Promise to  Trim    "Come  Trim  says he let poor  Mark  have 'emYou know he has not a Pair to his A  Besides you see he is just of my Size and they will fit him to a T whereas if I give 'em to youlook ye they  are not worth much and besides you could not get your Backside into them if you had them without tearing them all to Pieces"  Every Tittle of this was most undoubtedly true for  Trim  you must know by soul Feeding and playing the good Fellow at the Parson's was grown somewhat gross about the lower Parts  if not higher  So that as all  John  said upon the Occasion was fact  Trim  with much ado and after a hundred Hum's and Hah's at last out of mere Compassion to  Mark signs seals and delivers up  all Right Interest and Pretensions whatsoever in and to the said Breeches thereby binding his Heirs Erecutors Administrators and Assignes never mere to call the said Claim in Question  All this Renunciation was set forth in an ample Manner to be in pure Pity to  Mark  's Nakednessbut the Secret was  Trim  had an Eye to and firmly expected in his own Mind the great Green PulpitCloth and old Velvet Cushion which were that very Year to be taken down  which by the Bye could he have wheedled  John  a second Time out of 'em as he hoped he had made up the Loss of his Breeches Sevenfold  Now you must know this PulpitCloth and Cushion were not in  John's  Gift but in the ChurchWardens  c  However as I said above that  John  was a leading Man in the Parish  Trim  knew he could help him to them if he wouldBut  John  had got a Surfeit of himso when the PulpitCloth  c  were taken down they were immediately given  John  having a great Say in it to  William Doe  who understood very well what Use to make of them  As for the old Breeches poor  Mark Slender  lived to wear them but a short Time and they got into the Possession of  Lorry Slim  an unlucky Wight by whom they are still wornin Truth as you will guess they are very thin by this TimeBut  Lorry  has a light Heart and what recommends them to him is this that as thin as they are he knows that  Trim  let him say what he will to the contrary still envies the  Possessor  of them  and with all his Pride would be very glad to wear them after  him  Upon this Footing have these Affairs slept quietly for near ten Yearsand would have slept for ever but for the unlucky KickingBout which as I said has ripp'd this Squabble up afresh So that it was no longer ago than last Week that  Trim  met and insulted  John  in the public Town Way before a hundred Peopletax'd him with the Promise of the oldcastPairofblackBreeches notwithstanding  Trim  's solemn Renunciation twitted him with the PulpitCloth and Velvet Cushionas good as told him he was ignorant of the common Duties of his Clerkship adding very infolently That he knew not so much as to give out a common Psalm in Tune  John  contented himself with giving a plain Answer to every Article that  Trim  had laid to his Charge and appealed to his Neighbours who remembered the whole Affairand as he knew there was never any Thing to be got in wrestling with a  ChimneySweeperhe was going to take Leave of  Trim  for everBut holdthe Mob by this Time had got round them and their High Mightinesses insisted upon having  Trim  tried upon the Spot  Trim  was accordingly tried and after a full Hearing was convicted a second Time and handled more roughly by one or more of them than even at the Parson's  Trim  says one are you not ashamed of yourself to make all this Rout and Disturbance in the Town and set Neighbours together by the Ears about an oldwornoutPairofcastBreeches not worth Half a CrownIs there a castCoat or a Place in the whole Town that will bring you in a Shilling but what you have snapp'd up like a greedy Hound as you are  In the first Place are you not Sexton and DogWhipper worth Three Pounds a YearThen you begg'd the ChurchWardens to let your Wife have the Washing and Darning of the Surplice and ChurchLinen which brings you in Thirteen  Shillings and Four PenceThen you have Six Shillings and Eight Pence for oiling and winding up the Clock both paid you at  Easter  The Pinder's Place which is worth Forty Shillings a Yearyou have got that tooYou are the Bailiff which the late Parson got you which brings you in Forty Shillings moreBesides all this you have Six Pounds a Year paid you Quarterly for being MoleCatcher to the ParishAye says the luckless Wight abovementioned who was standing close to him with his Plush Breeches on  "You are not only MoleCatcher  Trim  but you catch STRAY CONIES too in the  Dark  and you pretend a  Licence  for it which I trow will be look'd into at the next Quarter Sessions"  I maintain it I have a Licence says  Trim  blushing as red as ScarletI have a Licenceand as I farm a Warren in the next Parish I will catch Conies every Hour of the Night  You catch Conies  cries a toothless old Woman who was just passing by  This set the Mob a laughing and sent every Man home in perfect good Humour  except  Trim  who waddled very slowly off with that Kind of inflexible Gravity only to be equalled by one Animal in the whole Creationand surpassed by none I am  SIR  Yours c c  FINIS  POSTSCRIPT  I Have broke open my Letter to inform you that I miss'd the Opportunity of sending it by the Messenger who I expected would have called upon me in his Return through this Village to  York  so it has laid a Week or ten Days by me  I am not sorry for the Disappointment because something has since happened in Continuation of this Affair which I am thereby enabled to transmit to you all under one Trouble  When I finished the above Account I thought as did every Soul in the Parish  Trim  had met with so thorough a Rebuff from  John  the Parish Clerk and the Town's Folks who all took against him that  Trim  would be glad to be quiet and let the Matter rest  But it seems it is not half an Hour ago since  Trim  sallied forth again and having borrowed a SowGelder's Horn with hard Blowing he got the whole Town round him and endeavoured to raise a Disturbance  and fight the whole Battle over againThat he had been used in the last Fray worse than a Dognot by  John  the ParishClerkfor I shou'd not quoth  Trim  have valued him a Rush single HandsBut all the Town sided with him and twelve Men in  Buckram  set upon me all at once and kept me in Play at Sword's Point for three Hours togetherBesides quoth  Trim  there were two misbegotten Knaves in  Kendal Green  who lay all the while in Ambush in  John  's own House and they all  sixteen  came upon my Back and let drive at me togetherA Plague says  Trim  of all Cowards  Trim  repeated this Story above a Dozen Timeswhich made some of the Neighbours pity him thinking the poor Fellow crackbrain'd and that he actually believed what he said After this  Trim  dropp'd the Affair of the  Breeches  and begun a fresh Dispute about the  ReadingDesk  which I told you had occasioned some small Dispute between the  late  Parson and  John  some Years ago  This  ReadingDesk  as you will observe was but an Episode wove into the main Story by the Byefor the main Affair  was the  Battle of the Breeches  and  Great WatchCoat  However  Trim  being at last driven out of these two Citadelshe has seized hold in his Retreat of this  ReadingDesk  with a View as it seems to take Shelter behind it  I cannot say but the Man has fought it out obstinately enoughand had his Cause been good I should have really pitied him For when he was driven out of the  Great WatchCoat  you see he did not run awaynohe retreated behind the  Breeches  and when he could make nothing of it behind the  Breeches  he got behind the  ReadingDesk  To what other Hold  Trim  will next retreat the Politicians of this Village are not agreedSome think his next Move will be towards the Rear of the Parson's Bootbut as it is thought he cannot make a long Stand thereothers are of Opinion That  Trim  will once more in his Life get hold of the Parson's Horse and charge upon him or perhaps behind himBut as the Horse is not easy to be caught the more general Opinion is That when he is driven out of the  ReadingDesk  he will make his last Retreat in such a Manner as if possible  to gain the  CloseStool  and defend himself behind it to the very last Drop If  Trim  should make this Movement by my Advice he should be left besides his Citadel in full Possession of the Field of Battlewhere 'tis certain he will keep every Body a League off and may pop by himself till he is weary Besides as  Trim  seems bent upon  purging  himself and may have Abundance of foul Humours to work off I think he cannot be better placed  But this is all Matter of SpeculationLet me carry you back to Matter of Fact and tell you what Kind of a Stand  Trim  has actually made behind the said  Desk  "Neighbours and Townsmen all I will be sworn before my Lord Mayor That  John  and his nineteen Men in  Buckram  have abused me worse than a Dog for they told you that I play'd fast and goloose with the  late  Parson and him in that old Dispute of theirs about the  ReadingDesk  and that I made Matters worse between them and not better"  Of this Charge  Trim  declared he was as innocent as the Child that was unborn  That he would be Booksworn he had no Hand in it He produced a strong Witnessand moreover insinuated that  John  himself instead of being angry for what he had done in it had actually thank'd him Aye  Trim  says the Wight in the Plush Breeches but that was  Trim  the Day before  John  found thee outBesides  Trim  there is nothing in thatFor the very Year that thou wast made Town's Pinder thou knowest well that I both thank'd thee myself and moreover gave thee a good warm Supper for turning  John Lund  's Cows and Horses out of my HardCorn Close which if thou had'st not done as thou told'st me I should have lost my whole Crop Whereas  John Lund  and  Thomas Patt  who are both here to testify and will take their Oaths on't That thou thyself wast the very Man who set the Gate open and after allit was not thee  Trim  'twas the Blacksmith's poor Lad who turn'd them out So that a Man may be thank'd and rewarded too for a good Turn which he never did nor ever did intend  Trim  could not sustain this unexpected Strokeso  Trim  march'd off the Field  without Colours flying or his Horn sounding or any other Ensigns of Honour whatever  Whether after this  Trim  intends to rally a second Timeor whether  Trim  may not take it into his Head to claim the Victoryno one but  Trim  himself can inform youHowever the general Opinion upon the whole is thisThat in three several pitch'd Battles  Trim  has been so  trimm'd  as never disastrous Hero was trimm'd before him  THE KEY  THIS  Romance  was by some Mischance or other dropp'd in the  MinsterYard York  and pick'd up by a Member of a small Political Club in that City where it was carried and publickly read to the Members the last Club Night  It was instantly agreed to by a great Majority That it was a  Political Romance  but concerning what State or Potentate could not so easily be settled amongst them  The President of the Night who is thought to be as clear and quicksighted as any one of the whole Club in Things of this Nature discovered plainly That the Disturbances therein set forth related to those on the  Continent  That  Trim  could be Nobody but the King of  France  by whose shifting and intriguing Behaviour all  Europe  was set together by the Ears'That  Trim  's Wife was certainly the  Empress  who are as kind together says he as any Man and Wife can be for their  LivesThe more Shame for 'em says an Alderman low to himselfAgreeable to this Key continues the PresidentThe  Parson  who I think is a most excellent Characteris His Most Excellent Majesty King  Gearge    John  the ParishClerk is the King of  Prussia  who by the Manner of his first entering  Saxony  shew'd the World most evidentlyThat he did know how to lead out the Psalm and in Tune and Time too notwithstanding  Trim  's vile Insult upon him in that ParticularBut who do you think says a Surgeon and ManMidwife who sat next him whose CoatButton the President in the Earnestness of this Explanation had got fast hold of and had thereby partly drawn him over to his Opinion Who do you think Mr President says he are meant by the  ChurchWardens SidesMen Mark Slender Lorry Slim c  Who do I think says he WhyWhy Sir as I take the Thingthe  ChurchWardens  and  SidesMen  are the  Electors  and the other  Princes  who form the  Germanick Body  And as for the other subordinate Characters of  Mark Slim  the  unlucky Wight  in the Plush Breechesthe  Parson  's  Man  who was so often out of the Way  c c  these to be sure are the several  Marshals  and  Generals  who fought or should have fought under them the last CampaignThe Men in  Buckram  continued the President are the Gross of the King of  Prussia  's Army who are as  stiff  a Body of Men as are in the WorldAnd  Trim  's saying they were twelve and then nineteen is a Wipe for the  Brussels Gazetteer  who to my Knowledge was never two Weeks in the same Story about that or any thing else  As for the rest of the  Romance  continued the President it sufficiently explains itselfThe  OldcastPairofBlackPlushBreeches  must be  Saxony  which the  Elector  you see  has left off wearing  And as for the  Great WatchCoat  which you know covers all it signifies all  Europe  comprehending at least so many of its different States and Dominions as we have any Concern with in the present War  I protest says a Gentleman who sat next but one to the President and who it seems was the Parson of the Parish a  Member not only of the Political but also of a Musical Club in the next StreetI protest says he if this Explanation is right which I think it isThat the whole makes a very fine SymbolYou have always some Musical Instrument or other in your Head I think says the AldermanMusical Instrument replies the Parson in AstonishmentMr Alderman I mean an Allegory and I think the greedy Disposition of  Trim  and his Wife in ripping the  Great WatchCoat  to Pieces in order to convert it into a Petticoat for the one and a Jerkin for the other is one of the most beautiful of the Kind I ever met with and will shew all the World what have been the true Views and Intentions of the Houses of  Bourbon  and  Austria  in this abominable CoalitionI might have called it WhoredomNay says the Alderman 'tis downright Adulterydom or nothing  This Hypothesis of the President's explain'd every Thing in the  Romance  extreamly well and withall was delivered with so much Readiness and Air of Certainty as begot an Opinion in two Thirds of the Club that Mr President was actually  the Author of the  Romance  himself But a Gentleman who sat on the opposite Side of the Table who had come pipinghot from reading the History of King  William  's and Queen  Anne  's Wars and who was thought at the Bottom to envy the President the Honour both of the  Romance  and Explanation too gave an entire new Turn to it all He acquainted the Club That Mr President was altogether wrong in every Supposition he had made except that one where the  Great WatchCoat  was said by him to represent  Europe  or at least a great Part of itSo far he acknowledged he was pretty right but that he had not gone far enough backwards into our History to come at the Truth He then acquainted them that the dividing the  Great WatchCoat  did and could allude to nothing else in the World but the  PartitionTreaty  which by the Bye he told them was the most unhappy and scandalous Transaction in all King  William  's Life It was that false Step and that only says he rising from his Chair and striking his Hand upon the Table with great Violence it was that false Step says he knitting his Brows  and throwing his Pipe down upon the Ground that has laid the Foundation of all the Disturbances and Sorrows we feel and lament at this very Hour and as for  Trim  's giving up the  Breeches  look ye it is almost Word for Word copied from the  French  King and  Dauphin  's Renunciation of  Spain  and the  WestIndies  which all the World knew as was the very Case of the  Breeches  were renounced by them on purpose to be reclaim'd when Time should serve  This Explanation had too much Ingenuity in it to be altogether slighted and in Truth the worst Fault it had seem'd to be the prodigious Heat of it which as an Apothecary who sat next the Fire observ'd in a very low Whisper to his next Neighbour was so much incorporated into every Particle of it that it was impossible under such Fermentation it should work its desired Effect  This however no way intimidated a little valiant Gentleman though he sat the very next Man from giving an Opinion as diametrically opposite as  East  is from  West  This Gentleman who was by much the best Geographer in the whole Club and moreover second Cousin to an Engineer was positive the  Breeches  meant  Gibraltar  for if you remember Gentlemen says he tho' possibly you don't the Ichnography and Plan of that Town and Fortress it exactly resembles a Pair of TrunkHose the two Promontories forming the two Slops  c c  Now we all know continued he that King  George  the First made a Promise of that important Pass to the King of  Spain  So that the whole Drift of the  Romance  according to my Sense of Things is merely to vindicate the King and the Parliament in that Transaction which made so much Noise in the World  A Wholesale Taylor who from the Beginning had resolved not to speak at all in the Debatewas at last drawn into it by something very unexpected in the last Person's Argument  He told the Company frankly he did not understand what  Ichnography  meantBut as for the Shape of a  Pair of Breeches  as he had had the Advantage of cutting out so many hundred Pairs in his  LifeTime he hoped he might be allowed to know as much of the Matter as another Man  Now to my Mind says he there is nothing in all the Terraqueous Globe a Map of which it seems hung up in his WorkShop so like a  Pair of Breeches  unmade up as the Island of  Sicily  Nor is there any thing if you go to that quoth an honest Shoemaker who had the Honour to be a Member of the Club so much like a  JackBoot  to my Fancy as the Kingdom of  Italy  What the Duce has either  Italy  or  Sicily  to do in the Affair cries the President who by this Time began to tremble for his HypothesisWhat have they to doWhy answered the  PartitionTreaty  Gentleman with great Spirit and Joy sparkling in his EyesThey have just so much Sir to do in the Debate as to overthrow your Suppositions and to establish the Certainty of mine beyond the Possibility of a Doubt For says he with an Air of Sovereign Triumph over the President's PoliticksBy the  PartitionTreaty  Sir both  Naples  and  Sicily  were the very Kingdoms made to  devolve upon the  Dauphin  and  Trim  's  greasing the Parson's Boots  is a Devilish Satyrical Strokefor it exposes the Corruption and Bribery made Use of at that Juncture in bringing over the several States and Princes of  Italy  to use their Interests at  Rome  to stop the Pope from giving the Investitures of those Kingdoms to any Body elseThe Pope has not the Investiture of  Sicily  cries another GentlemanI care not says he for that  Almost every one apprehended the Debate to be now ended and that no one Member would venture any new Conjecture upon the  Romance  after so many clear and decisive Interpretations had been given But holdClose to the Fire and opposite to where the Apothecary sat there sat also a Gentleman of the Law who from the Beginning to the End of the Hearing of this Cause seem'd no way satisfied in his Conscience with any one Proceeding in it This Gentleman had not yet opened his Mouth but had waited patiently till they had all gone thro' their several Evidences on the other Sidereserving himself like an expert Practitioner for the last Word in the Debate When the  PartitionTreaty  Gentleman had finish'd what he had to sayHe got upand advancing towards the Table told them That the Error they had all gone upon thus far in making out the several Facts in the  Romance  was in looking too high which with great Candor he said was a very natural Thing and very excusable withall in such a Political Club as theirs For Instance continues he you have been searching the  Registers  and looking into the  Deeds  of  Kings  and  Emperors  as if Nobody had any  Deeds  to shew or compare the  Romance  to but themselvesThis continued the Attorney is just as much out of the Way of good Practice as if I should carry a Thing slapdash into the House of Lords which was under forty Shillings and might be decided in the next CountyCourt for six Shillings and EightpenceHe then took the  Romance  in his Left Hand and pointing with the ForeFinger of his Right towards the second Page he humbly begg'd Leave to observe and to do him Justice he did it in somewhat of a  forensic Air  That the  Parson John  and  Sexton  shewed incontestably the Thing to be  Tripartite  now if you will take Notice Gentlemen says he  these several Persons who are Parties to this Instrument are merely Ecclesiastical that the  ReadingDesk PulpitCloth  and  Velvet Cushion  are tripartite too and are by Intendment of Law Goods and Chattles merely of an Ecclesiastick Nature belonging and appertaining 'only unto them'  and to them only  So that it appears very plain to me That the  Romance  neither directly nor indirectly goes upon Temporal but altogether upon ChurchMattersAnd do not you think says he softening his Voice a little and addressing himself to the Parson with a forced SmileDo not you think Doctor says he That the Dispute in the  Romance  between the  Parson  of the Parish and  John  about the Height of  John  's Desk is a very fine Panegyrick upon the  Humility  of  ChurchMen  I think says the Parson it is much of the same Fineness with that which your Profession is complimented with in the pimping dirty pettyfogging Character of  Trim  which in my Opinion Sir is just such another Panegyrick upon the  Honesty  of  Attornies  Nothing whets the Spirits like an InsultTherefore the Parson went on with  a visible Superiority and an uncommon AcutenessAs you are so happy Sir continues he in making Applicationspray turn over a Page or two to the black LawLetters in the  Romance  What do you think of them SirNaypray read the Grant of the  Great WatchCoat  and  Trim  's Renunciation of the  Breeches  Why there is downright  Lease  and  Release  for you'tis the very Thing Manonly with this small Differenceand in which consists the whole Strength of the PanegyricThat the Author of the  Romance  has convey'd and reconvey'd in about ten Lineswhat you with the glorious Prolixity of the Law could not have crowded into as many Skins of Parchment  The Apothecary who had paid the Attorney the same Afternoon a Demand of Three Pounds Six Shillings and EightPence for much such another Jobbwas so highly tickled with the Parson's Repartee in that particular Pointthat he rubb'd his Hands together most ferventlyand laugh'd most triumphantly thereupon  This could not escape the Attorney's Notice any more than the Cause of it did escape his Penetration  I think Sir says he dropping his Voice a Third you might well have spared this immoderate Mirth since you and your Profession have the least Reason to triumph here of any of usI beg quoth he that you would reflect a Moment upon the  CobWeb  which  Trim  went so far for and brought back with an Air of so much Importance in his Breeches Pocket to lay upon the Parson's cut FingerThis said CobWeb Sir is a finespun Satyre upon the flimsy Nature of one Half of the ShopMedicines with which you make a Property of the Sick the Ignorant and the UnsuspectingAnd as for the Moral of the  CloseStoolPan  Sir 'tis too plainDoes not nine Parts in ten of the whole Practice and of all you vend under  its Colours  pass into and concenter in that one nasty UtensilAnd let me tell you Sir says he raising his Voicehad not your unseasonable Mirth blinded you you might have seen that  Trim  's carrying the CloseStoolPan upon his Head the whole Length of the Town  without blushing is a pointed Railleryand one of the sharpest Sarcasms Sir that ever was thrown out upon youfor it unveils the solemn Impudence of the whole Profession who I see are ashamed of nothing which brings in Money  There were two Apothecaries in the Club besides the Surgeon mentioned before with a Chemist and an Undertaker who all felt themselves equally hurt and aggrieved by this discourteous RetortAnd they were all five rising up together from their Chairs with full Intent of Heart as it was thought to return the  Reproof Valiant  thereuponBut the President fearing it would end in a general Engagement he instantly call'd out  To Order  and gave Notice That if there was any Member in the Club who had not yet spoke and yet did desire to speak upon the main Subject of the Debatethat he should immediately be heard  This was a happy Invitation for a stammering Member who it seems had but a weak Voice at the best and having often attempted to speak in the Debate but to  no Purpose had sat down in utter Despair of an Opportunity  This Member you must know had got a sad Crush upon his Hip in the late  Election  which gave him intolerable Anguishso that in short he could think of nothing elseFor which Cause and others he was strongly of Opinion That the whole  Romance  was a just Gird at the late  York  Election and I think says he that the  Promise  of the  Breeches  broke may well and truly signify  Somebody's else Promise  which was broke and occasion'd so much Disturbance amongst us  Thus every Man turn'd the Story to what was swimming uppermost in his own Brainso that before all was over there were full as many Satyres spun out of itand as great a Variety of Personages Opinions Transactions and Truths found to lay hid under the dark Veil of its Allegory as ever were discovered in the thricerenowned History of the Acts of  Gargantua  and  Pantagruel  At the Close of all and just before the Club was going to break upMr President  rose from his Chair and begg'd Leave to make the two following Motions which were instantly agreed to without any Division  First  Gentlemen says he as  Trim  's Character in the  Romance  of a shuffling intriguing Fellowwhoever it was drawn for is in Truth as like the  French King  as it can stareI move That the  Romance  be forthwith  printed  For continues he if we can but once turn the Laugh against him and make him asham'd of what he has done it may be a great Means with the Blessing of God upon our Fleets and Armies to save the Liberties of  Europe  In the  second  Place I move That Mr Attorney our worthy Member be desired to take Minutes upon the Spot of every Conjecture which has been made upon the  Romance  by the several Members who have spoke which I think says he will answer two good Ends  st  It will establish the Political Knowledge of our Club for ever and place it in a respectable Light to all the World  In the  next  Place it will furnish what will be wanted that is a  Key  to the  Romance  In troth you might have said a whole Bunch of  Keys  quoth a Whitesmith who was the only Member in the Club who had not said something in the Debate But let me tell you Mr President says he That the  Right Key  if it could but be found would be worth the whole Bunch put together
