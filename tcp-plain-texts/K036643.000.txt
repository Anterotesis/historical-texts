 CRAIGMILLAR CASTLE AN ELEGY    HOM  Without the Gods how short a period stands  The proudest monument of mortal hands  POPE  EDINBURGH  Printed for the AUTHOR and sold by all the Booksellers  MDCCLXXVI  TO JAMES BEATTIE LL D PROFESSOR OF LOGIC AND MORAL PHILOSOPHY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF ABERDEEN THIS ELEGY IS INSCRIBED AS A MARK OF THE GREATEST ESTEEM BY  THE AUTHOR  CRAIGMILLAR CASTLE AN ELEGY  WROTE IN SEPTEMBER MDCCLXXV  THE Sun declining o'er the western sky  In roseat splendor clos'd his circling course  And ting'd the clouds with many a varied dye  When following Fancy's everflowing source  Of cool poetic joy I bent my way  Tow'rd a majestic Castle's ruins wide  Within whose gates once royalty bore sway  And for a season laid its cares aside  The bleating flocks were pent within the fold  The jovial reapers long had left the vale  The plowman at his cheary fireside told  The merry story or the mournful tale  Now SOL had gone to other worlds to rise  And all the place to silence was resign'd  While on the ruin fixed were my eyes  A pleasing melancholy fill'd my mind  Comparing present things with past a tear  Starting from either eye down gently stole  Tho' from my heart wrung by reflection drear  A tear which pity wish'd not to control  While yielding thus to lenient grief I deem'd  A rushing noise I heard and looking round  A sudden light effulgent on me beam'd  And all my soul in admiration bound  Upon the hill descended from on high  A BEING far transcending human kind  I gaz'd upon him as he glided nigh  His form engaging all my pensive mind  An azure robe of a celestial dye  Around him wildly wanton'd in the breeze  Bare were his feet his looks did seem to vye  With newfall'n snow that tips the aged trees  Placid and mild his look yet conscious seem'd  Of majesty and piercing was his eye  That flashing with a heav'nly ardor gleam'd  As form'd with ease to scan earth sea and sky  His decent footstops with a silver wand  Were guided as majestically slow  Tow'rd me he calm advanc'd and took his stand  Beside me lost in Pity's balmy woe  "AH mortal said he thou art mov'd in vain  "To see all human grandeur yield to Fate  "When from its fall thou shouldst essay to gain  "Instruction not bewail its fallen state  "'Tis my delight at fall of dewy eve  "To visit and converse with mortals good  "My heav'nly dictates who with joy receive  "In the low cot or 'mid the shady wood  "The vain magnificence of man may prove  "My present mournfully instructive theme  "Whose fate observ'd might ev'n the proudest move  "To own all earthly pomp a fleeting dream"  Thus while he spoke I recogniz'd the pow'r  Of CONTEMPLATION radiant son of Truth  When empty joys invite or sorrows lowr  The comforter of age the guide of youth  For often he my lone sequester'd cot  Had deign'd to visit where he taught my soul  Tranquilly to enjoy life's chequer'd lot  And each impetuous passion to control  "Behold he thus resum'd yon turrets high  "The once proud ornaments of that strong tow'r  "Now rent and shatter'd by th' inclement sky  "Scarce rests the vestige of their former pow'r  "Th' approaching foe by no portcullis dire  "Nor bar of massy iron nor steady gate  "Would now be forc'd disdainful to retire  "And leave a strength unworthy of his hate  "Upon this moat once as a sea profound  "Which erst no daring footstep ever trode  "The wanton infant now may sportive bound  "And harmless lambs chuse a secure abode  "The room where arms in horrid order plac'd  "A glimmering light reflected to the eye  "Is now with instruments of labour grac'd  "There sword to sickle chang'd thou may'st descry  "That chamber where the Queen whose charms divine  "Made wond'ring nations own the pow'r of love  "Oft bath'd her snowy limbs in sparkling wine  "Now proves a lonely refuge for the dove  "Yon hall capacious where the flowing bowl  "Inspir'd convivial mirth unblam'dly free  "Unfolded all the secrets of the soul  "And whelm'd each care in heartenliv'ning glee  "Where the lovekindling lute and sounding lyre  "Rapt all the mind or in soft pleasure drown'd  "Where the hoarse trumpet rouzing martial fire  "Made vaulted roof and rocky walls resound  "There sullen silence reigns and there the owl  "Makes her abode that loves the gloomy night  "Thence not the least noise rises save the howl  "Of bats and beasts obscene that shun the light  "Yon mould'ring chapel which in days of yore  "To some romantic saint was sacred made  "Where th' early priest his matins murmur'd o'er  "And said his numerous masses for the dead  "There now each noxious animal and weed  "In baleful darkness dwells And where the cross  "Was plac'd the henbane spreads a deadly shade  "And the foul toad conceal'd lyes in the moss  "See o'er the place deep melancholy reigns  "Where splendor once diffus'd its brightest day  "And of a palace ev'n these poor remains  "Will soon to nameless ruin drop a prey  "Such fate awaits all sublunary things  "Save those that rest on VIRTUE'S firm support  "She aid alone 'gainst Time's fell ravage brings  "And smiles secure at Fortune's cruel sport"  Thus while he spoke his robe expanding wide  Majestic as a cherub still he stood  Then thro' the liquid air was seen to glide  And swift ascending gain'd his blest abode  I silent turning from the eastern seas  Behold the fullorb'd moon refulgent rise  No fluttering zephyr fans the yellow trees  Each breathe in gentle cadence softly dies  The strepent horn no more the hills rebound  But all the air is wrapt in stillness mild  Save where the faroff curfeu's solemn sound  Steals on the ear melodiously wild  Fair CYNTHIA'S ray swiftgliding as she rose  First mark'd the place where a proud vessel lay  Which in the lulling calm seem'd to repose  While not a gale its slagging sails did sway  Then slow that tow'ring hill to view disclos'd  At whose wide base a princely palace stands  And by it to each ruthless storm expos'd  A sacred ruinshame of modern hands  Sure SCOTIA'S kings august and heroes brave  Claim the most splendid honours of the tomb  To them their country who but liv'd to save  No longer be deny'd the grateful dome  Soon all EDINA'S glories rose to sight  Her lofty spires her castle proudly strong  The distant  Forth  reflecting the pale light  As slow he flow'd the laughing fields among  Autumn her golden mantle o'er the land  Had cast each sound was hush'd in silence still  Save where the rivulet murmur'd thro' the sand  The snowey moonlight sleep'd on every hill  A scene so sweetly solemn Fancy's eye  Survey'd with rapture and tranquil delight  But while she softly breath'd a parting sigh  Resign'd its beauties to the silent night  THE END  NOTES  Stanza  II  Royalty bore sway  c  QUEEN MARY resided at
