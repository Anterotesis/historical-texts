 THE APPRENTICE A FARCE IN TWO ACTS As it is Perform'd at the THEATREROYAL in  DruryLane  By Mr MURPHY  LONDON Printed for PAUL VAILLANT facing  Southampton∣street  in the  Strand    Price One Shilling  ADVERTISEMENT  THERE was Room to apprehend be∣fore the Representation of the following Farce that the Subject might appear extravagant and merely ideal but the real ex∣istence of it is displayed in such a lively and picturesque Manner by the Author of the Prologue and was at once so universally felt by the Audience that all necessity of saying any thing farther on this Head is now entirely superseded What at present remains to be feared is that the  Apprentice  will not make so lively a figure in the closet as on the Stage where the Parts in general were allow∣ed to be well performed where  Simon  was re∣presented with a perfection of folly where the Skill of Mr  Yates  exhibited the Impo∣tence of a Mind whose Ideas extend very little beyond the multiplication Table and whose Passions are ever in a crazy Conflict unless when they all subside into a sordid Love of Gain and where Mr  Woodward's  admirable comic Genius gave such a Spirit to the whole that there is Reason to think when∣ever he relinquishes the Part the  Apprentice  may again elope from his Friends without any one's desiring him to Return to his Business  The Author has however endeavoured to render all its Defects as excusable as he could and he wishes no stronger Criticism could be brought against him than the two following Observations which he thinks very singular and somewhat entertaining  I can't  says one  give my Opinion of the Piece till I have  Time to consider the Depth of it    Po  says another  this is not all his  OWN  I remember some of it in other Plays  In order to assist the former in his deep Researches and to enable the latter to make good his charge of Plagia∣rism References are made to the several Plays from which the distempered Hero of the piece makes up his motley but characteristick Dia∣lect The intelligent Reader if he think it worth his while to turn over these Leaves will be pleased to remember that a Parody does not always carry with it a Burlesque on the Lines al∣luded to For as it is judiciously remarked in a note to Mr  Pope's  Dunciad  It is a common but foolish mistake that a ludicrous Parody of a grave and celebrated Passage is a Ridicule of that Passage A Ridicule indeed there is in every Parody but where the Image is transfer∣red from one Object to another there the Ri∣dicule falls not on the Thing  imitated  but  imitating  Thus for Instance when  A Line of pope's in a ludicrous Account of the coronation in Henry the VIIIth  Old Edward's Armour beams on Cibbers Breast  It is without Doubt an Object ridiculous enough but then I think  it falls neither on old King  Edward  nor his  Armour  but on his  ArmourBearer  only  But this is prefacing a Farce as if it were a Thing of moment I shall therefore dismiss it to the Press without adding any Thing far∣ther except my grateful Acknowledgements for the very favourable Reception with which the Public has honoured the trifling Scenes of  Their most obliged and most obedient Servant  ARTHUR MURPHY  Tavistock Row  th Jan  PROLOGUE  written by Mr GARRICK  spoken by Mr MURPHY  dressed in Black  BEhold a Wonder for Theatric Story  The  Culprit  of this Night appears before ye  Before his Judges dares these Boards to tread  "With all his Imperfections on his Head"  Prologues precede the  Piece  in mournful Verse  As Undertakers walk before the Hearse  Whose doleful March may strike the harden'd Mind  And wake it's feelings for the Dead behind  Trickt out in Black thus Actors try their Art  To melt that  Rock  of  ROCKS  the Critic's Heart  No  acted  Fears my Vanity betray  I am indeed  what others only play  Thus far myself The Farce come next in View  Tho' many are it's Faults at least 'tis  NEW  No smuggled pilfer'd Scenes from France we show  'Tis English English Sirs from Top to Toe  Tho' Coarse my Colours and my Hand unskill'd  From real life my little Cloth is fill'd  My Hero is a Youth by Fate design'd  For culling simples  but whose Stagestruck Mind  Nor  Fate  could  rule  nor his  Indentures  bind  A Place there is where such young Quixots meet  'Tis call'd the  SPOTINGCLUB  a glorious Treat  Where Prentic'dKings alarm

List List O List"  And frightens Denmark's Prince a young Tobacconist  The Spirit too clear'd from his deadly White  Rises a Haberdasher to the Sight  Not young Attorneys have this Rage withstood  But change their  Pens  for  TRUNCHEONS Ink  for  BLOOD  And Strange Reverse die for their Country's Good  Thro' all the Town this Folly you may trace  M  self am Witness 'tis a common Case  I've further Proofs could ye but think I wrong ye  Look round you'l find some Spouting Youths among ye  To check these Heroes and their Laurels crop  To bring 'em back to  Reason  and their  SHOP  To raise an

paltry scribling Fool to have me out  He'll say perhaps he thought I could not  spout  Malice and Envy to the last Degree  And why I wrote a Farce as well as He  And fairly ventur'd it without the Aid  Of Prologue dress'd in black and Face in Masquerade  O Pit have Pity see how I'm dismay'd  Poor Soul this canting Stuff will never do  Unless like Bay's he brings his Hangman too  But  granting  that from these same Obsequies  Some Pickings to our Bard in black arise  Should your Applause to Joy convert his Fear  As Pallas turns to feast  Lardella's Bier  Yet 'twould have been a better Scheme by half  T'have thrown his Weeds aside and learn't with me to laugh  I could have shewn him had he been inclin'd  A spouting Junto of the Female Kind  There dwells a Milliner in yonder Row  Welldress'd fullvoic'd and nobly built for Shew  Who when in Rage she scolds at  Sue  and  Sarah  Damn'd Damn'd Dissembler  thinks she's more than  ZARA  She has a Daughter too that deals in Lace  And sings O  Ponder  well and  Cherry Chase  And fain would fill the fair  Ophelia  's Place  And in her cock't up Hat and Gown of Camblet  Presumes on something  touching the Lord Hamlet  A Cousin too she has with squinting Eyes  With wadling Gait and Voice like  London Cries  Who for the Stage too short by half a Story  Acts Lady Townly thus in all her Glory  And while she's traversing her scanty Room  Cries "Lord my Lord what can I do at home"  In short there's Girls enough for all the Fellows  The Ranting Whining Starting and the Jealous  The Hotspurs Romeos Hamlets and Othellos  Oh Little do those silly People know  What dreadful Trials Actors undergo  Myself who most in Hamony delight  Am scolding here from Morning until Night  Then take Advice from me ye giddy Things  Ye Royal Milliners

easily accounted forWhy when he ought to be reading the Dis∣pensatory there was he constantly poring over Plays and Farces and  Shakespear    Wingate  Ay that damned  Shakespear  I hear the Fellow was nothing but a Deerstealer in  Warwickshire  Zookers if they had hanged him out of the Way he would not now be the Ruin of honest Men's Chil∣dren But what Right had he to read  Shakespear  I never read  Shakespear  Wounds I caught the Rascal myself read∣ing that nonsensical Play of  Hamblet  where the Prince is keeping Company with Strol∣lers and Vagabonds A fine Example Mr  Gargle    Gargle  His

Way with all my Heart what care I let him follow his Nose let him follow his Nosea ridiculous  Gargle  Ay ridiculous indeed SirWhy for a long Time past he could not converse in the Language of common Sense Ask him but a trivial Question and he'd give some cramp Answer out of some of his Plays that had been running in his Head and so there's no understanding a Word he says  Wingate  Zookers this comes of his keep∣ing Company with Wits and be damned to 'em for Wit'sha ha Wits a fine Thing indeedha ha Its the most beg∣garly rascally contemptible Thing on Earth  Gargle  And then Sir I have found
