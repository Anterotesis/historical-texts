ODE  THE sun comes on apace and thro' the Signs  Travels unwearied as he hotter grows  Above the herbage and beneath the mines  Own his warm influence while his axle glows  The flaming Lion meets him on the way  Proud to receive the flaming god of day  In fullest bloom the damask rose is seen  Carnations boast their variegated die  The fields of corn display a vivid green  And cherries with the crimson orient vie  The hop in blossom climbs the lofty pole  Nor dreads the lightning tho' the thunders roll  The wealth of Flora like the rainbow shows  Blending her various hues of light and shade  How many tints would emulate the rose  Or imitate the lilly's bright parade  The flowers of topaz and of saphire vie  With all the richest tinctures of the sky  Beneath the swelling udder teems the pail  The shining scythe appears in every lawn  With cooling beverage the swains regale  Their sunburnt nymphs allsportive as the fawn  Nor yet the orchard shows its fruit of gold  While the wool's shorn from off the fleecy fold  The vegetable world is all alive  Green grows the goosberry on its bush of thorn  The infant bees now swarm around the hive  And the sweet bean perfumes the lap of morn  Millions of embryos take the wing to fly  The young inherit as the old ones die  'Tis summer allconvey me to the bower  The bower of myrtle form'd by Myra's skill  There let me waste away the noontide hour  Fann'd by the breezes from yon cooling rill  By Myra's side reclin'd the burning ray  Shall be as grateful as the cool of day  HYMN TO THE MORNING  WRITTENIN SUMMER  HAil goddess of the silver star  Whose twinkling orb gives signal of the day  Oh queen of light whose virgin ray  The sun salutes in his celestial car  Whose active heat melts every cloud  That would thy dawn of glory shroud  And stain the lustre of thy laughing eye  While beneath thy azure sky  Dimplecheek'd Health with rosy feature glows  Thro' lowing pastures on she goes  Wearing the milkmaid's ruddy grace  Ease in her tripping step and pleasure in her face  Forerunner of the day's bright reign  And giver of unspeakable delight  How nature triumphs at thy sight  And looks thanksgiving thro' her large domain  At thy approach the conscious trees  Bend humbly to thy tepid breeze  And every flower a fresher brightness wears  Labour to the field repairs  Where buxom Ceres waits him with a smile  Whistling he crosses every stile  Or chants some lovelorn ditty's air  With which he means to charm and win his favourite fair  Oh sovereign of the spicy gale  Of odours pure and salutary dews  Oft as thy star its beam renews  Thy violet breath entranc'd let me inhale  Give me to range thy wholesome hills  Thy vallies bright with crystal rills  And verdant lawns where many a wildflower grows  There while Zephyr softly blows  Let me indulge the heavendevoted thought  And render praises as I ought  To him whose power and love divine  Call'd thee from total void and bad thy beauty shine  WW  ON VIEWING AN EXTENSIVE PROSPECT FROM THE TOP OF ASTON HILLS IN BUCKINGHAMSHIRE COMPOS'D ON HORSEBACK  BY A YOUNG LADY  HOW wonderous are thy works O God most high  Maker of all above and all beneath the sky  In this fair scene wheree'er I turn my view  Beauties on beauties rise for ever new  Yon lofty hill crown'd with those stately trees  That sinking valley that receives the breeze  Yon velvet downs where sheep unnumber'd feed  Those fields which wave with corn that greensward mead  Proclaim aloud the wise Creator's hand  For chance could ne'er produce a work so grand  All these in concert hymn their Maker's praise  While with delight and wonder mortals gaze  A HARVEST SCENE  BEHOLD  The green fields yellowing into corny gold  While o'er their ranks an old man half appears  How hale he looks tho' hoar'd with seventy years  His prospect mounts slowpac'd he strives to climb  And seems some antient monument of time  Propt o'er his staff the reverend father stands  And views heaven's blessings with uplifted hands  Gleeful in heart computes the year's increase  And portions out in thought his homely race  His homely race before his hopes improve  And labour in obedience for his love  Sweepy they cut then bind the sheafy grain  And bend beneath the burthen of the plain  His cheerful eyes with silent praises crown  Their toils and smile at vigour once his own  'Till the midsun to second nature's call  Noonmarks the distant steeple's ivied wall  Thence warn'd he waves his arms with giddy haste  The circling summons to a cool repast  ODE TO GENIUS  THou child of nature genius strong  Thou master of the poet's song  Before whose light Art's dim and feeble ray  Gleams like the taper in the blaze of day  Thou lov'st to steal along the secret shade  Where Fancy bright aerial maid  Awaits thee with her thousand charms  And revels in thy wanton arms  She to thy bed in days of yore  The sweetly warbling Shakespeare bore  Whom every muse endow'd with every skill  And dipt him in that sacred rill  Whose silver streams flow musical along  Where Phoebus' hallow'd mount resounds with raptur'd song  Forsake not thou the vocal choir  Their breasts revisit with thy genial fire  Else vain the studied sounds of mimic art  Tickle the ear but come not nigh the heart  Vain every phrase in curious order set  On each side leaning on the stopgap epithet  Vain the quick rhime still tinkling in the close  While pure description shines in measur'd prose  Thou bear'st aloof and look'st with high disdain  Upon the dull mechanic train  Whose nerveless strains flag on in languid tone  Lifeless and lumpish as the bagpipe's drowzy drone  No longer now thy altars blaze  No poet offers up his lays  Inspir'd with energy divine  To worship at thy sacred shrine  Since taste  By Taste is here meant the modern affectation of it  with absolute domain  Extending wide her leaden reign  Kills with her melancholy shade  The blooming scyons of fair fancy's tree  Which erst full wantonly have stray'd  In many a wreath of richest poesie  For when the oak denies her stay  The creeping ivy winds her humble way  No more she twists her branches round  But drags her feeble stem along the barren ground  Where then shall exil'd genius go  Since only those the laurel claim  And boast them of the poet's name  Whose sober rhimes in even tenour flow  Who prey on words and all their flowrets cull  Coldly correct and regularly dull  Why sleep the sons of genius now  Why Wartons rests the lyre unstrung  Dr Akenside  And thou blest bard around whose sacred brow  Great Pindar's delegated wreath is hung  Arise and snatch the majesty of song  From dullness' servile tribe and art's unhallow'd throng  AN ELEGY ON A PILE OF RUINS  BY J CUNNINGHAM  Aspice murorum moles praeruptaque saxa  IN the full prospect yonder hill commands  O'er forests fields and vernalcoated plains  The vestige of an antient abbey stands  Close by a ruin'd castle's rude remains  Half buried there lie many a broken bust  And obelisk and urn o'erthrown by Time  And many a cherub here descends in dust  From the rent roof and portico sublime  The rivulets oft frighted at the sound  Of fragments tumbling from the towers on high  Plunge to their source in secret caves profound  Leaving their banks and pebbly bottoms dry  Where reverend shrines in Gothic grandeur stood  The nettle or the noxious nightshade spreads  And ashlings wafted from the neighbouring wood  Thro' the worn turrets wave their trembling heads  There Contemplation to the crowd unknown  Her attitude compos'd and aspect sweet  Sits musing on a monumental stone  And points to the Memento at her feet  Soon as sage evening check'd day's sunny pride  I left the mantling shade in moral mood  And seated by the maid's sequester'd side  Thus sigh'd the mouldering ruins as I view'd  Inexorably calm with silent pace  Here Time has pass'dWhat ruin marks his way  This pile now crumbling o'er its hallow'd base  Turn'd not his step nor could his course delay  Religion rais'd her supplicating eyes  In vain and Melody her song sublime  In vain Philosophy with maxims wise  Would touch the cold unfeeling heart of Time  Yet the hoar tyrant tho' not mov'd to spare  Relented when he struck its finish'd pride  And partly the rude ravage to repair  The tottering towers with twisted ivy tied  How solemn is the cell o'ergrown with moss  That terminates the view yon cloister'd way  In the crush'd wall a timecorroded cross  Religion like stands mouldering in decay  Where the mild sun thro' saintencypher'd glass  Illum'd with mellow light that brownbrow'd isle  Many rapt hours might Meditation pass  Slow moving 'twixt the pillars of the pile  And Piety with mysticmeaning beads  Bowing to saints on every side in urn'd  Trod oft the solitary path that leads  Where now the sacred altar lies o'erturn'd  Thro' the grey grove between those withering trees  'Mongst a rude group of monuments appears  A marbleimag'd matron on her knees  Half wasted like a Niobe in tears  Low levell'd in the dust her darling's laid  Death pitied not the pride of youthful bloom  Nor could maternal piety dissuade  Or soften the fell tyrant of the tomb  The relicks of a mitred saint may rest  Where mouldering in the nich his statue stands  Now nameless as the crowd that kiss'd his vest  And crav'd the benediction of his hands  Near the brown arch redoubling yonder gloom  The bones of an illustrious chieftain lie  As trac'd upon the timeunletter'd tomb  The trophies of a broken fame imply  Ah what avails that o'er the vassal plain  His rights and rich demesnes extended wide  That honour and her knights compos'd his train  And chivalry stood marshall'd by his side  Tho' to the clouds his castle seem'd to climb  And frown'd defiance on the desperate foe  Tho' deem'd invincible the conqueror Time  Levell'd the fabric as the founder low  Where the light lyre gave many a softening sound  Ravens and rooks the birds of discord dwell  And where society sat sweetly crown'd  Eternal solitude has fix'd her cell  The lizard and the lazy lurking bat  Inhabit now perhaps the painted room  Where the sage matron and her maidens sat  Sweetsinging at the silverwo king loom  The traveller's bewilder'd on a waste  And the rude winds incessant seem to roar  Where in his groves with arching arbours grac'd  Young lovers often sigh'd in days of yore  His aqueducts that led the limpid tide  To pure canals a crystal cool supply  In the deep dust their barren beauties hide  Time's thirst unquenchable has drain'd them day  Tho' his rich hours in revelry were spent  With Comus and the laughterloving crew  And the sweet brow of beauty still unbent  Brighten'd his fleecy moments as they flew  Fleet are the fleecy moments fly they must  Not to be stay'd by masque or midnight roar  Nor shall a pulse amongst that mouldering dust  Beat wanton at the smiles of beauty more  Can the deep statesman skill'd in great design  Protract but for a day precarious breath  Or the tun'd follower of the sacred Nine  Sooth with his melody insatiate Death  Notho' the palace bar her golden gate  Or monarchs plant ten thousand guards around  Unerring and unseen the shaft of fate  Strikes the devoted victim to the ground  What then avails ambition's wide stretch'd wing  The schoolman's page or pride of beauty's bloom  The crapeclad hermit and the richrob'd king  Levell'd lie mix'd promiscuous in the tomb  The Macedonian monarch wise and good  Bade when the morning's rosy reign began  Courtiers should call as round his couch they stood  " Philip remember thou'rt no more than man  " Tho' glory spread thy name from pole to pole  " Tho' thou art merciful and brave and just  " Philip reflect thou'rt posting to the goal  " Where mortals mix in undistinguish'd dust"  So Saladin for arts and arms renown'd  Egypt and Syria's wide domains subdued  Returning with imperial triumphs crown'd  Sigh'd when the perishable pomp he view'd  And as he rode high in his regal car  In all the purple pride of conquest drest  Conspicuous o'er the trophies gain'd in war  Plac'd pendent on a spear his burial vest  While thus the herald cried"This son of power  " This Saladin to whom the nations bow'd  " May in the space of one revolving hour  " Boast of no other spoil but yonder shroud"  Search where Ambition rag'd with rigour steel'd  Where slaughter like the rapid lightning ran  And say while memory weeps the bloodstain'd field  Where lies the chief and where the common man  Vain are the pyramids and mottoed stones  And monumental trophies rais'd on high  For Time confounds them with the crumbling bones  That mix'd in hasty graves unnotic'd lie  Rests not beneath the turf the peasant's head  Soft as the lord's beneath the labour'd tomb  Or sleeps one colder in his close clay bed  Than t'other in the wide vault's dreary womb  Hither let Luxury lead her looserob'd train  Here flutter Pride on purplepainted wings  And from the moral prospect learnhow vain  The wish that sighs for sublunary things  THE FEMINEAD OR FEMALE GENIUS  A POEM  BY JOHN DUNCOMBE MA WRITTEN IN THE YEAR MDCCVLI  SHall lordly man the theme of every lay  Usurp the muse's tributary bay  In kingly state on Pindus' summit sit  Tyrant of verse and arbiter of wit  By Salic law the female right deny  And view their genius with regardless eye  Justice forbid and every muse inspire  To sing the glories of a sisterchoir  Rise rise bold swain and to the listening grove  Resound the praises of the sex you love  Tell how adorn'd with every charm they shine  In mind and person equally divine  'Till man no more to female merit blind  Admire the person but adore the mind  To these weak strains O thou the sex's friend  And constant patron  The author of those three celebrated works Pamela Clarissa and Sir Charles Grandison  Richardson attend  Thou who so oft with pleas'd but anxious care  Hast watch'd the dawning genius of the fair  With wonted smiles wilt hear thy friend display  The various graces of the female lay  Studious from folly's yoke their minds to free  And aid the generous cause espous'd by thee  Long o'er the world did Prejudice maintain  By sounds like these her undisputed reign  " Woman she cried to thee indulgent heaven  " Has all the charms of outward beauty given  " Be thine the boast unrival'd to enslave  " The great the wise the witty and the brave  " Deck'd with the Paphian rose's damask glow  " And the valelilly's vegetable snow  " Be thine to move majestic in the dance  " To roll the eye and aim the tender glance  " Or touch the strings and breathe the melting song  " Content to emulate that airy throng  " Who to the sun their painted plumes display  " And gaily glitter on the hawthorn spray  " Or wildly warble in the beechen grove  " Careless of aught but music joy and love"  Heavens could such artful slavish sounds beguile  The freeborn sons of Britain's polish'd isle  Could they like fam'd Ulysses' dastard crew  Attentive listen and enamour'd view  Nor drive the Syren to that dreary plain  In loathsome pomp where eastern tyrants reign  Where each fair neck the yoke of slavery galls  Clos'd in a proud seraglio's gloomy walls  And taught that levell'd with the brutal kind  Nor sense nor souls to women are assign'd  Our British nymphs with happier omens rove  At freedom's call thro' wisdom's sacred grove  And as with lavish hand each sister grace  Shapes the fair form and regulates the face  Each sister muse in blissful union join'd  Adorns improves and beautifies the mind  Even now fond fancy in our polish'd land  Assembled shows a blooming studious band  With various arts our reverence they engage  Some turn the tuneful some the moral page  These led by Contemplation soar on high  And range the heavens with philosophic eye  While those surrounded by a vocal choir  The canvas tinge or touch the warbling lyre  Here like the stars' mix'd radiance they unite  To dazzle and perplex our wandering sight  The muse each charmer singly shall survey  And tune to each her tributary lay  So when in blended tints with sweet surprize  Assembled beauties strike our ravish'd eyes  Such as in Lely's melting colours shine  Or spring great Kneller from a hand like thine  On all with pleasing awe at once we gaze  And lost in wonder know not which to praise  But singly view'd each nymph delights us more  Disclosing graces unperceiv'd before  First let the muse with generous ardor try  To chase the mist from dark opinion's eye  Nor mean we here to blame that father's care  Who guards from learned wives his booby heir  Since oft that heir with prudence has been known  To dread a genius that transcends his own  The wise themselves should with discretion chuse  Since letter'd nymphs their knowledge may abuse  And husbands oft experience to their cost  The prudent housewife in the scholar lost  But those incur deserv'd contempt who prize  Their own high talents and their sex despise  With haughty mien each social bliss defeat  And fully all their learning with conceit  Of such the parent justly warns his son  And such the muse herself will bid him shun  But lives there one whose unassuming mind  Tho' grac'd by nature and by art refin'd  Pleas'd with domestic excellence can spare  Some hours from studious ease to social care  And with her pen that time alone employs  Which others waste in visits cards and noise  From affectation free tho' deeply read  " With witwell natur'd and with books well bred"  With such and such there are each happy day  Must fly improving and improv'd away  Inconstancy might fix and settle there  And wisdom's voice approve the chosen fair  Nor need we now from our own Britain rove  In search of genius to the Lesbian grove  Tho' Sappho there her tuneful lyre has strung  And amorous griefs in sweetest accents sung  Since here in Charles's days amidst a train  Of shameless bards licentious and profane

convinced the world of the force of unassisted nature by imitating and equalling some of our most approved poets by the strength of her parts and the vivacity of her genius  Leapor's form flies shadowy o'er the green  Those envied honours nature lov'd to pay  The briarbound turf where erst her Shakespear lay  Now on her darling Mira she bestows  There o'er the hallow'd ground she fondly

colours of the watery bow  Yet thro' the grove harsh discord they prolong  Tho' rich in gaudy plumage poor in song  Now bear me Clio to that Kentish strand  Whose rude o'erhanging cliffs and barren sand  May challenge all the myrtleblooming bowers  Of fam'd Italia when at evening hours  Thy own  Mrs Eliza Carter of Deal well known to the learned world for her late traslation of Epictetus has

Bloom to her cheek and rapture to her heart  Beneath her roof the redbreast shall prolong  Unchill'd by frosts his tributary song  For her the lark shall wake the dappled morn  And linnet twitter from

arts on all her labours smile  And while the Nine their votary inspire  " One dips the pencil and one strings the lyre"  O may her life's clear current smoothly glide  Unruffled by misfortune's boisterous tide  So while the charmer leads her blameless days  With that content which she so well displays  Her own Honoria we in her shall view  And think her allegoric vision true  Thus wandering wild among the golden grain  That fruitful floats on Bansted's airy plain  Careless I sung while summer's western gale  Breath'd health and fragrance thro' the dusky vale  When from a neighbouring hawthorn in whose shade  Conceal'd she lay uprose th' Aonian maid  Pleas'd had she listen'd and with smiles she cried  " Cease friendly swain be this thy praise and pride  " That thou of all the numerous tuneful throng  " First in our cause hast fram'd thy generous song  " And ye our sister choir proceed to tread  " The flowery paths of fame by science led  " Employ by turns the needle and the pen  " And in their favourite studies rival men  " May all our sex your glorious track pursue  " And keep your bright example still in view  " These lasting beauties will in youth engage  " And smooth the wrinkles of declining age  " Secure to bloom unconscious of decay  " When all Corinna's roses fade away  " For even when love's short triumph shall be o'er  " When youth shall please and beauty charm no "more  " When man shall cease to flatter when the eye  " Shall cease to sparkle and the heart to sigh  " In that dread hour when parent dust shall claim  " The lifeless tribute of each kindred frame  " Even then shall wisdom for her chosen fair  " The fragrant wreaths of virtuous fame prepare  " Those wreaths which flourish in a happier clime  " Beyond the reach of envy and of time  " While here th' immortalizing muse shall save  " Your darling names from dark Oblivion's grave  " Those names the praise and wonder shall engage  " Of every polish'd wise and virtuous age  " To latest times our annals shall adorn  " And save from folly thousands yet unborn"  AN EVENING CONTEMPLATION IN A COLLEGE  BY THE SAME  THE curfew tolls the hour of closing gates  With jarring sound the porter turns the key  Then in his dreary mansion slumbering waits  And slowly sternly quits ittho' for me  Now shine the spires beneath the paly moon  And thro' the cloister peace and silence reign  Save where some fidler scrapes a drowsy tune  Or copious bowls inspire a jovial strain  Save that in yonder cobwebmantled room  Where lies a student in profound repose  Oppress'd with ale wideechoes thro' the gloom  The droning music of his vocal nose  Within those walls where thro' the glimmering shade  Appear the pamphlets in a mouldering heap  Each in his narrow bed till morning laid  The peaceful fellows of the college sleep  The tinkling bell proclaiming early prayers  The noisy servants rattling o'er their head  The calls of business and domestic cares  Ne'er rouse these sleepers from their downy bed  No chattering females croud their social fire  No dread have they of discord and of strife  Unknown the names of husband and of fire  Unfelt the plagues of matrimonial life  Oft have they bask'd along the sunny walls  Oft have the benches bow'd beneath their weight  How jocund are their looks when dinner calls  How smoke the cutlets on their crouded plate  O let not Temperance toodisdainful hear  How long their feasts how long their dinners last  Nor let the fair with a contemptuous sneer  On these unmarried men reflections cast  The splendid fortune and the beauteous face  Themselves confess it and their sires bemoan  Too soon are caught by scarlet and by lace  These sons of science shine in black alone  Forgive ye fair th' involuntary fault  If these no feats of gaiety display  Where thro' proud Ranelagh's wideechoing vault  Melodious Frasi trills her quavering lay  Say is the sword well suited to the band  Does 'broider'd coat agree with sable gown  Can Mechlinlaces shade a churchman's hand  Or learning's votaries ape the beaux of town  Perhaps in these timetottering walls reside  Some who were once the darlings of the fair  Some who of old could tastes and fashions guide  Controul the manager and awe the player  But science now has fill'd their vacant mind  With Rome's rich spoils and truth's exalted views  Fir'd them with transports of a nobler kind  And bade them slight all femalesbut the muse  Full many a lark hightowering to the sky  Unheard unheeded greets th' approach of light  Full many a star unseen by mortal eye  With twinkling lustre glimmers thro' the night  Some future Herring who with dauntless breast  Rebellion's torrent shall like him oppose  Some mute unconscious Hardwicke here may rest  Some Pelham dreadful to his country's foes  From prince and people to command applause  'Midst ermin'd peers to guide the high debate  To shield Britannia's and Religion's laws  And steer with steady course the helm of state  Fate yet forbids nor circumscribes alone  Their growing virtues but their crimes confines  Forbids in Freedom's veil t' insult the throne  Beneath her mask to hide the worst designs  To fill the madding crowd's perverted mind  With "pensions taxes marriages and Jews"  Or shut the gates of heaven on lost mankind  And wrest their darling hopes their future views  Far from the giddy town's tumultuous strife  Their wishes yet have never learn'd to stray  Content and happy in a single life  They keep the noiseless tenor of their way  Even now their books from cobwebs to protect  Inclos'd by doors of glass in Doric style  On polish'd pillars rais'd with bronzes deckt  They claim the passing tribute of a smile  Oft are the authors' names tho' richly bound  Misspelt by blundering binders' want of care  And many a catalogue is strow'd around  To tell th' admiring guest what books are there  For who to thoughtless ignorance a prey  Neglects to hold short dalliance with a book  Who there but wishes to prolong his stay  And on those cases casts a lingering look  Reports attract the lawyer's parting eyes  Novels lord Fopling and sir Plume require  For songs and plays the voice of beauty cries  And sense and nature Grandison desire  For thee who mindful of thy lov'd compeers  Dost in these lines their artless tale relate  If 'chance with prying search in future years  Some antiquarian shall enquire thy fate  Haply some friend may shake his hoary head  And say 'Each morn unchill'd by frosts he ran  ' With hose ungarter'd o'er yon turfy bed  ' To reach the chapel ere the psalms began  ' There in the arms of that lethargic chair  ' Which rears its mothdevoured back so high  ' At noon he quaff'd three glasses to the fair  ' And por'd upon the news with curious eye  ' Now by the fire engag'd in serious talk  ' Or mirthful converse would he loitering stand  ' Then in the garden chose a sunny walk  ' Or launch'd the polish'd bowl with steady hand  ' One morn we miss'd him at the hour of prayer  ' Beside the fire and on his favourite green  ' Another came nor yet within the chair  ' Nor yet at bowls nor chapel was he seen  ' The next we heard that in a neighbouring shire  ' That day to church he led a blushing bride  ' A nymph whose snowy vest and maiden fear  ' Improv'd her beauty while the knot was tied  ' Now by his patron's bounteous care remov'd  ' He roves enraptur'd thro' the fields of Kent  ' Yet ever mindful of the place he lov'd  ' Read here the letter which he lately sent'  THE LETTER  " IN rural innocence secure I dwell  " Alike to fortune and to fame unknown  " Approving conscience cheers my humble cell  " And social quiet marks me for her own  " Next to the blessings of religious truth  " Two gifts my endless gratitude engage  " A wife the joy and transport of my youth  " A son the pride and comfort of my age  " Seek not to draw me from this kind retreat  " In loftier spheres unfit untaught to move  " Content with calm domestic life where meet  " The smiles of friendship and the sweets of love"  ODE PRESENTED TO HIS GRACE THOMAS HOLLES DUKE OF NEWCASTLE CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE ON HIS ARRIVAL THERE JUNE XIV MDCCLIII  BY THE SAME  FRom the mossgrown coral cave  Circled by the silver wave  Where to thy adoring eyes  Oft thy laurel'd sons arise  Father Camus haste and hear  Haste hither haste and to thy favourite mead  The blithesome band of sister Naiads lead  For see from rural joys and public cares  From Esher's peaceful grove  And Claremont's proud alcove  From Freedom's council and Britannia's king  Once more to thy Castalian spring  The guardian of the muse repairs  O'er yon embroider'd plain  With patriots in his train  Propt on thy sculptur'd urn behold him stray  When Athens call'd could Rome detain  Or Tusculum delay  Haste then and hail the happy hour  That to thy fragrant bower  To Granta and the Nine  Such sons such patriots gave and made a Holles thine  This and the two following stanzas allude to those three signal proofs which his Grace has given of his regard for the learning morality and splendor of his university By establishing annual prices By forming new regulations and By setting on foot a subscription for a new library towards which his majesty with his usual munificence contributed l  In some sequester'd shade  Attended by the tuneful maid  Pleas'd let me catch the plausive song  Of all the sister arts that round him throng  When with a golden emblematic prize  He decks each blushing youth  Who conquer'd in the lists of fame  By science favour'd and approv'd by truth  Since strength of genius far outvies  The body's brutal force  Since one excursion of the mind exceeds  The swiftest sallies of victorious steeds  Less glorious were the boughs  Which at the boasted Grecian games  Adorn'd a Theron's or a Hiero's brows  Tho' Pindar's lofty lays immortalize their names  From thee great friend of virtue's cause  What various blessings flow  To thy unwearied zeal the muses owe  That check'd with just controul  By salutary laws  Youth's rapid streams serenely roll  For Discipline resumes her wide command  And dauntless rules with unrelaxing hand  Even now aspiring to the sky  A longwish'd structure strikes my sight  With wonder and delight  Piercing the vale of dark futurity  For soon shall Camus' glassy stream  Reflect a rising dome  Worthy Athens worthy Rome  Worthy Phoebus' blissful seat  Worthy Pelham's lov'd retreat  The muse's glory and the poet's theme  O Granta with majestic mien  Advance and hail the sacred scene  Let music leave her airy tower  And breathe the softest strains  Let Fragrance quit her myrtle bower  And range the flowery plains  She shall her choicest incense shed  Round Holles' honour'd head  While George's praises music shall proclaim  And warble to the groves their sovereign's name  Shall we our tributary lays deny  When he still mindful of the Nine  Who long have left their native sky  Charm'd with the glories of the Brunswick line  Pours forth his treasures to complete  The grandeur of their favourite seat  And bids their domes with Parian lustre shine  His bright example shall their sons inspire  The great the wealthy fire  And raise to loftiest heights their towering fame  O Camus thro' thy laurel shade  Tho' kings and statesmen oft have stray'd  Tho' in these groves with patriot hand  Sage Burleigh bore the olive wand  And on thy borders crown'd with bay  Eliza heard the muse's lay  Once more exalt thy ready brows for see  Tho' charg'd with Europe's fate  The noble and the great  The statesman and the prince remember thee  ODE TO THE HON JOHN YORK  IMITATED FROM HORACE BOOK II ODE XVI  BY THE SAME  FOR quiet on Newmarket's plain  The shivering curate prays in vain  When wintery showers are falling  And stumbling steed and whistling wind  Quite banish from his anxious mind  The duties of his calling  With thoughts engross'd by routs and plays  The gallant soph for quiet prays  Confuted and confuting  And quiet is alike desir'd  Even by the king's professor tir'd  With wrangling and disputing  In crouded senate on the chair  Of our vicechancellor sits Care  Undaunted by the Mace  Care climbs the yatch when adverse gales  Detain or tear our patron's sails  And ruffles even his Grace  How blest is he whose annual toil  With wellrang'd trees improves a soil  For ages yet unborn  Such as at humble  Dr Herring late lord archbishop of Canterbury was some time rector of Barley a village near Barkway in Hertfordshire  Barley plan'd  By mitred Herring's youthful hand  The cultur'd glebe adorn  From place to place we still pursue  Content and hope in each to view  The visionary guest  Vainly we fly intruding care  Not all like you the joys can share  Of Wimple and of Wrest  Then let us snatch while in our power  The present transitory hour  And leave to heaven the morrow  Youth has its griefs a friend may die  Or nymph deceive for none can fly  The giant hand of sorrow  His country's hope and parent's pride  In bloom of life young Blandford died  His godlike father's eyes  Were dimm'd with age and helpless tears  And heaven to me may grant the years  Which it to you denies  Your rising virtues soon will claim  A portion of your brothers' fame  And catch congenial fire  They shine in embassy and war  They grace the senate and the bar  And emulate their sire  Invested with the sacred gown  You soon to rival their renown  The glorious task shall join  And while they guard Britannia's laws  You steady to Religion's cause  Shall guard the laws divine  ON MR GARRICK  BY THE SAME  WHile other bards in venturous song proclaim  Culloden's triumph and extol the name  Of Cumberland say unambitious muse  Canst thou long hesitate what theme to chuse  When Garrick form'd by nature and by art  To please at once and to improve the heart  Crown'd by the tragic muse with early bays  Claims thine attention and demands thy praise  Great Shakespear Otway all the laureate throng  Who shine immortal in dramatic song  Have long despair'd on Britain's stage to find  Their strength of thought with strength of action  But now they view with wonder and delight join'd  One born to act what they were born to write  When Hamlet's looks declare his wild affright  When his sire's ghost usurps the dead of night  Or when unhappy Lear o'erpowr'd with rage  And passion heated by perverse old age  Too late with tears his hastiness bemoans  Each heart with pity or with terror owns  His praise too great by words to be exprest  And silence speaks our approbation best  Proceed thou glory of the British stage  T' extort the tears of an admiring age  Pursue the noble task in nature read  Still mend the heart and still instruct the head  Talk to the passions reason to the mind  Reform improve and humanize mankind  Let Shakespear still with strength of fancy fire  Or Rowe's soft strains with tender thoughts inspire  Let Dryden with harmonious numbers move  Or Otway sooth to pity or to love  Still melt with sorrow or with pleasure charm  Let terror startle or let fear alarm  Dissolve with pity or with rage inflame  And equally in all our praises claim  Britain her Booth and Rome her Roscius lost  No longer then shall mourn no longer boast  But Rome and Britain shall with wonder view  Roscius and Booth reviv'd again in you  AN EPISTLE FROM YORK TO A FRIEND IN KENT  BY THE SAME  WIth wonted candor once again peruse  The hasty sallies of a distant muse  Who thus from York in artless metre sends  Health and good wishes to her absent friends  Tho' spacious moors diversify the scene  And mountains rise and rivers roll between  Tho' here far off in northern climes remov'd  From those she valued and from those she lov'd  Yet still the same affection she retains  In distant regions and on northern plains  Hearts that are once in friendship's union tied  The fates may part but never can divide  For fancy uncontroul'd by distance leads  Th' enraptur'd mind to longforgotten meads  Which in her lively colours pleas'd we view  And almost think th' ideal landscape true  O'er hills and streams extends her boundless power  And joins the Trent and Humber to the Stour  But now my friend to fair Augusta's walls  Lo Pleasure points the way and Garrick calls  To crown her favour'd son the tragic queen  In solemn silence hovers o'er the scene  And owns that none deserves the laurel more  Tho' Booth obtain'd it and tho' Roscius wore  Here let us oft with fix'd attention wait  And weep at Lear's distress or Hamlet's fate  And oft my various travels shall beguile  The winter evening and extort a smile  From my enquiring friend who pleas'd shall hear  What various beauties in the North appear  What grandeur reigns in CastleHoward's dome  The taste of Athens and the pride of Rome  Where Lely's melting colours claim our praise  And Cromwell's frown thy touch Vandyke displays  In Studley's groves how art with nature joins  And that improves the plan which this designs  How buildings grottos and cascades surprize  And 'midst embowering trees rude Gothic temples rise  Fain would my muse tho' in unequal verse  The rugged charms of Scarborough rehearse  Fain would she those romantic scenes impart  Where nature triumphs undisguis'd by art  She tries with trembling wing but tries in vain  Such arduous heights of fancy to attain  And tir'd desists from subjects that require  A Lambert's pencil or a Dryden's lyre  ANSWERED FROM CANTERBURY  BY A FRIEND  A Song O Philo from the rural shade  Due to thy friendship and so long unpaid  O would the muse in lays like thine inspire  And in my bosom wake the lingering fire  I pray but pray in vain with scornful eyes  She still the tributary song denies  O how shall I invoke a wanton maid  Who loves to wander thro' the rural shade  But scorns the senseless jargon of the schools  Foe to proud science and her frigid rules  I whom that goddess in her chain has bound  To tread her tedious and unvaried round  I whose dull genius is untaught to roam  Beyond the narrow limits of her home  Thee thee my friend whom happier fate conveys  To regions worthy of immortal lays  Thee every muse with rapture shall inspire  And kindle in thy breast the latent fire  Where thousand venerable domes arise  Where Verrio's breathing canvas meets thine eyes  Where pleas'd thou view'st how Scarborough's rugged brow  Frowns horrid o'er the darken'd floods below  So sings the lark hightowering to the skies  And views hill dale and forest as she flies  While the poor linnet by some tyrant hind  To the close prison of the cage confin'd  Forgets the sprightly wildness of her song  The grove the valley and th' aerial throng  The time shall come when to the shades retir'd  With nature charm'd and by the muse inspir'd  Happy some little rural flock to tend  Happy to boast that Philo is my friend  I'll try once more my longforgotten strain  And in retirement court the tuneful train  There o'er each labour shall the muses smile  And bless my evening walk and morning toil  Each season to my friend the song I'll give  And he wellpleas'd each offering shall receive  And while with smiles he reads the artless line  His judgment shall correct his taste refine  Come then my friend together let us tread  Once more where science lifts th' aspiring head  Dull goddess from whose seat and barren plain  Fly all the nymphs and all the sylvan train  Yet pleas'd even here we'll own sweet friendship's power  Smiling in converse o'er the social hour  Here patient o'er the dreary desert toil  Cheer'd with the prospect of a happier soil  PROLOGUE SPOKEN AT THE CHARTERHOUSE MDCCLIII  BY JOHN DUNCOMBE MA  TOnight ye Britons let the deathless name  Of Roman Terence your attention claim  To you undaunted he submits his cause  And dares the test of your severest laws  Convinc'd that scholars will with pleasure hear  For Attic scenes must charm an Attic ear  Those Attic scenes which once in learning's bloom  With Iös shook the theatres of Rome  There Caesar oft forgot the toils of fight  And modest Maro listen'd with delight  Even vestals heard unblam'd the spotless lay  And priests and censors went improv'd away  O would the polish'd bards of Britain quit  The dangerous track of loose licentious wit  Soon might our theatres in virtue's cause  Be deem'd a glorious supplement to laws  No fans should skreen the blushing beauty's face  And prelates might an English drama grace  Such moral scenes should envy's rage disarm  New Catos then should fire new Bevilles charm  Well may this sacred spot your reverence claim  Where first their authors caught the heavenborn flame  Methinks even now their laurell'd shades descend  And hovering round us our attempts befriend  Each bosom must th' inspiring influence feel  Warm'd by the names of Addison and Steele  While each fond breast this pleasing theme enjoys  O think they once were unexperienc'd boys  Think too that we may frame some deathless lay  If cheer'd by you in this our first essay  When action flattens let the sense prevail  And language charm you where the speakers fail  TO THE AUTHOR OF CLARISSA  BY THE SAME  IF 'mid their round of pleasure to convey  An useful lesson to the young and gay  To swell their eyes with pearly drops and share  With cards and dress the converse of the fair  If with the boasted bards of classic age  Th' attention of the learned to engage  And in the bosom of the rake to raise  A tender social feelingmerit praise  The gay the fair the learn'd even rakes agree  To give that praise to nature truth and thee  Transported now to HarlowePlace we view  Thy matchless maid her godlike tasks pursue  Visit the sick or needy and bestow  Drugs to relieve or words to soften woe  Or with the pious Lewen hear her soar  Heights unattain'd by female minds before  Then to her ivybower she pleas'd retires  And with light touch the trembling keys inspires  While wakeful Philomel no more complains  But raptur'd listens to her sweeter strains  Now direful contrast in each gloomy shade  Behold a pitying swain or weeping maid  And hark with sullen swing the tolling bell  Proclaims that loss which language fails to tell  In awful silence soon a sight appears  That points their sorrows and renews their tears  For lo farblackening all the verdant meads  With slow parade the funeral pomp proceeds  Methinks even now I hear th' encumber'd ground  And pavement echo with a rumbling sound  And see the servants tearful eyes declare  With speaking look the herse the herse is here  But O thou sister of Clarissa's heart  Can I the anguish of thy soul impart  When from your chariot flown with breathless haste  Her claycold form yet beauteous you embrac'd  And cried with heaving sobs and broken strains  Are theseare thesemy muchlov'd friend's remains  Then view each Harloweface remorse despair  And selfcondemning grief are pictur'd there  Now first the brother feels with guilty sighs  Fraternal passions in his bosom rise  By shame and sorrow equally opprest  The sister wrings her hands and beats her breast  With streaming eyes too late the mother blames  Her tame submission to the tyrant James  Even he the gloomy father o'er the herse  Laments his rashness and recalls his curse  And thus each parent who with haughty sway  Expects his child to tremble and obey  Who hopes his power by rigour to maintain  And meanly worships at the shrine of gain  Shall mourn his error and repenting own  That bliss can ne'er depend on wealth alone  Riches may charm and pageantry invite  But what are these unless the minds unite  Drive then insatiate avarice from your breast  Nor think a Solmes can make Clarissa blest  And you ye fair the wish of every heart  Tho' grac'd by nature and adorn'd by art  Tho' sprightly youth its vernal bloom bestow  And on your cheeks the blush of beauty glow  Here see how soon those roses of a day  Nipt by a frost fade wither and decay  Nor youth nor beauty could Clarissa save  Snatch'd to an early not untimely grave  But still her own unshaken innocence  Spotless and pure unconscious of offence  In the dread hour of death her bosom warm'd  With more than manly courage and disarm'd  The griesly king in vain the tyrant tried  His awful terrorsfor she smil'd and died  You too ye libertines who idly jest  With virtue wrong'd and innocence distrest  Who vainly boast of what should be your shame  And triumph in the wreck of female fame  Be warn'd like Belford and behold with dread  The hand of vengeance hovering o'er your head  If not in Belton's agonies you view  What dying horrors are reserv'd for you  In vain even Lovelace healthy young and gay  By nature form'd to please and to betray  Tried from himself by change of place to run  For that intruder Thought he could not shun  Tasteless were all the pleasures that he view'd  In foreign courts for Conscience still pursu'd  The lost Clarissa each succeeding night  In starry garment swims before his sight  Nor ease by day her shrill complaints afford  But far more deeply wound than Morden's sword  O if a sage had thus on Attic plains  Improv'd at once and charm'd the listening swains  Had he with matchless energy of thought  Great truths like these in antient Athens taught  On fam'd Ilyssus' banks in Parian stone  His breathing bust conspicuous would have shone  Even Plato in Lyceum's awful shade  Th' instructive page with transport had survey'd  And own'd its author to have well supplied  The place his

A MOONLIGHT ODE  BY A LADY  Nox erat et coelo fulgebat Luna sereno  HOR  WIthin a lonely gallery's awful gloom  Where pictur'd ancestors adorn the room  And one dim taper distant gleam'd  Veil'd by a dusky cloud the Queen of Night  Diffus'd a pleasing melancholy light  And faintly thro' the windows beam'd  Within deep silence reign'd no mortal stirr'd  Without the raven croak'd illomen'd bird  And loudly blustering Boreas blew  When thrice the gallery's length I walk'd along  And meditated much on right and wrong  The past the present rushing to my view  Thus on the couch I at my ease reclin'd  Revolving o'er and o'er within my mind  All I had suffer'd or enjoy'd  Pleasure remember'd present sorrow brings  And from past sorrow satisfaction springs  Then my whole life my thoughts employ'd  I view'd my failings and my virtues too  And doubtless gave myself all merit due  Yet for impartial judgment strove  From crime I clear'd my conscience not from blame  And dar'd my own an honest heart

complain  How many far more wretched do I see  Who think me happy and who envy me  But who can know another's pain  My tears proceed not from imagin'd woe  There is a tender cause that makes them flow  A cause I from the world conceal  Yet here in peaceful solitude retir'd  I sing as by the plaintive muse inspir'd  And all my secret grief reveal  But from behind the cloud see Cynthia shine  Come forth in all her majesty divine  And dart direct on me her rays  Her aspect ever cheerful and serene  Enlivens this too solitary scene  And seems to chide my plaintive lays  Justly chaste goddess dost thou chide my song  I've sung in melancholy strains too long  Too long have left thy peaceful grove  Vouchsafe protectress of the virgin train  To take a wandering innocent again  And save her from

can that art the truth disguise  The flimsy veil too thin  That shows the heart to curious eyes  As gauze the polish'd skin  No more in vain then Emma seek  Your sorrow to conceal  The downcast eye and livid cheek  In silence will reveal  Your generous heart above deceit  For spotless faith renown'd  Is now commenc'd an aukward cheat  Since love an entrance found  Thro' pathless groves alone you stray  By Cynthia's twinkling beam  And steal from social friends away  To haunt Sabrina's stream  And while with sympathizing sighs  I ask your cause of woe  I see your labouring bosom rise  And grateful tears o'erflow  I see the crimson blush declare  The struggles of your mind  Yet still preserv'd with fatal care  The secret rests behind  Passion supprest the stronger grows  Let friendship's voice prevail  Within my faithful breast repose  Your melancholy tale  Friendship shall sooth your soul to peace  And utterance give relief  And powerful reason by degrees  Will mitigate your grief  Or yet your timid heart to spare  Which dreads to speak the truth  Let me the man you love declare  And thus describe the youth  Adorn'd with every grace refin'd  With every virtue bless'd  Esteem'd belov'd by all mankind  By all degrees caress'd  His matchless worth which fix'd your love  Will justify your flame  And tho' you unsuccessful prove  You sully not your fame  Then let not melancholy's gloom  Your erring steps decoy  To scenes where joy can never bloom  Nor peace nor youthful joy  From reason's path to sad despair  Her magic wand will lead  And frenzy's various shapes appear  Wheree'er you chance to tread  How hard the lot of kindred souls  When adverse fate divides  For wisdom Henry's heart controuls  And every action guides  Else had his tongue ere now reveal'd  What oft his eyes confess  His captive passion mourns conceal'd  Nor ever hopes success  Let prudence then with duty join'd  Break haughty passion's chains  Or resignation teach your mind  To bear what fate ordains  Reflect how short our joy our woe  How short our life and love  Souls tho' divided here below  May meet refin'd above  HYMN TO RESIGNATION  BY THE SAME  FAtigued with illness sick

unfolds her blooming hoard  Say should no branch shoot forth no buds appear  Nor lofty trees their friendly shade afford  Should cedars oaks and pines despoil'd be seen  Of all the leafy crowns that grace their heads  Nor herb nor flower revive nor pasture green  Then would not Silvio say all nature fades  To different ages different tastes belong  With hoary years ill suits impassion'd love  Yet he who feels no soft desires when young  A foe to nature and to heaven must prove  Silvio look round and what thou see'st allow  That what or heaven or earth or sea can give  For use or pleasure all to love we owe  Earth heaven and sea his genial power receive  By Love inspir'd the birds their amorous tales  Breathe thro' the air and waft from spray to spray  Love thro' the woods o'er savage beasts prevails  And him th' unnumber'd shoals of fish obey  IMITATED FROM METASTASIO  BY THE SAME  YOU rejoice without hope and you hope without reason  And you fear where no danger is nigh  You give credit to phantoms no faith to the truth  And each moment produces a lye  Meditation an hundred vain fancies presents  And grim Death without dying is known  A thousand dreams waking no sunshine dispells  Yet the martyr no torment will own  You contemplate another yourself you forget  Indulging too freely a wandering mind  Too oft by desires pursuing desires create  And then terror on terror you find  Such contention of passions you constantly feel  Yet the deified tyrant approve  So enchanting the mixture of pleasure and pain  In this powerful frenzy call'd Love  If your heart did not wanton thro' pleasure's gay paths  Quite unknown would this deity be  Idle Fancy adorns him with arrows and bow  And you worship at Error's decree  TRANSLATIONS FROM THE ITALIAN  SONNET FROM PETRARCH  BY THE SAME  ALone and pensive thro' deserted meads  Slowly with measur'd step I wandering go  My eyes intent to shun each path that leads  Where printed sands the human footsteps show  No other refuge left but in despair  To shun the world's discernment I retire  Since now in Pleasure's train no part I bear  My outward mien betrays my inward fire  Methinks henceforth the mountains groves and plains  And rivers know my melancholy mind  But only these to all beside untold  And yet what savage track unsought remains  However rude but Love my haunts will find  And he and I alternate converse hold  SONNET FROM THE SAME  BY THE SAME  IF 'tis not Love what passion rules my heart  And if it is O heaven then what is Love  If good why flows such poison from the dart  If bad the torment why do I approve  If with my choice I love then why complain  If not with choice how fruitless to lament  O living death O most delightful pain  Thy power subdues tho' I deny consent  Thus like some fragile bark by adverse winds  Expos'd to sea when no skill'd pilot steers  Contending passions sway my labouring soul  It seeks for knowledge fatal error finds  Nor knows itself or what it hopes or fears

Silent was he or could unmov'd appear  Were looks perturb'd and proud to thee express'd  Such looks as force from me the frequent tear  Alas I've heard in former times his eyes  Kindled by thine his

AND AJUTT  A GREENLAND TALE  TAKEN FROM THE FOURTH VOLUME OF THE RAMBLER INSCRIBED TO SAMUEL JOHNSON MA  BY MRS PENNY  O Johnson fam'd for elegance and sense  Whose works instruction and delight dispense  Where nice correction charms our wondering eyes  And in whose lines embellish'd beauties rise  Say will you deign this humble verse to hear  Sprung from your thoughts and nurtur'd by your care  A female bard unknown to wit or fame  To you inscribes what from your genius came  ANNINGAIT AND AJUTT  LOve powerful Love each being can controul  Brighten the mind and animate the soul  Love can with truth the mighty magic boast  Of sacred warmth amidst eternal frost  Witness fair Ajutt pride of icy plains  Where darkness half the year triumphant reigns  And faithful generous Anningait the youth  By Love taught softness by that softness truth  Both flourish'd sweet on Greenland's rigid coast  Pure as their snow and constant as their frost  No polish'd arts of specious vice they knew  The youth was noble and the maid was true  From earliest dawn their charms no rival saw  By nature blest beyond her usual law  No Greenland swain like Anningait could dare  To fix th' harpoon or rouse the whale to war  From his firm hand the unerring javelin flew  His bark sure loaded by the seal he slew  Blest in his friends illustrious was his race  Grac'd by his birth his birth his actions grace  'Twas at a solemn feast in Greenland held  Where beauteous Ajutt every nymph excell'd  That Anningait first saw the blooming fair  With modest sense and unaffected air  He gaz'd with rapture Ajutt did the same  Their souls congenial caught the rising flame  On her alone he fix'd his firm regard  The choicest whale was to her board preferr'd  A spotless ermine emblem of her mind  To deck her shoulders he from his resign'd  With these a gift of greater prize bestow'd  A heart all her's a heart supremely good  To sing her charms his artless voice was fir'd  Hence flow'd the lay which love and she inspir'd  ' Ajutt more beauteous than the willow's shade  ' Fragrant as mountainthyme inchanting maid  ' Whose taper fingers white and polish'd are  ' As morse's teeth and nimble as the hare  ' Thy smiles as grateful as dissolving snow  ' When welcome sunshine bids our lakes to flow  ' Far as e'er thought can trace I'd thee pursue  ' And be thy guardian and thy lover too  ' No power shall Ajutt from her love divide  ' Nor midland cliffs nor eastern caverns hide  ' Not the malignant genius of the rock  ' Our foe avow'd rapacious Amarock  ' Should from my faithful arm my Ajutt tear  ' That arm unwearied should protect my fair  ' Even Haffgufa the fear of every maid  ' I'd dauntless meet nor once his prowess dread  ' Be kind then Ajutt and my passion try  ' Who lives but in thy smile without thy smile must die  ' And may that wretch if such a wretch there be  ' Who blasts our union or dare envy me  ' Be in his icy bed for ever laid  ' Without his bow nor wept by faithful maid  ' And in the laud of souls when he arrives  ' And new to life in that dread clime revives  ' May then his scull the burning drops receive  ' From starry lamps nor other gift relieve  ' For sure by fate fair Ajutt must be mine  ' Pure is my passion and my flame divine'  Th' attentive fishers Greenland's choicest swains  Enraptur'd listen and approve his strains  The nymphs on Ajutt cast an envious eye  And wish their fate with such a swain to try  While she tho' pleas'd conceals the soft regard  And beauty's power exerts to be the more rever'd  But now long absent Sol the god of day  Began his beams on sparkling frost to play  The snow dissolves long stagnant waters rise  A new creation seems to greet their eyes  The Greenland youths the happy omen hail  Prepare for combat with the mighty whale  With active ardor all renew their toil  And count in thought the treasures of their oil  Foremost in all see Anningait appear  For lovely Ajutt deigns the toil to share  Her presence animates the hero's mind  He rush'd on danger fleeter than the wind  With agile arm th' astonish'd seahorse struck  And drew him panting on his wellfix'd hook  In utmost depths the diving seal pursued  And pierc'd th' emerging whale with sinewy strength endued  And when with loaded bark to land they steer  With active skill he caught the dappled deer  Their glossy skins he drest to deck his bride  But hope and anxious fear his breast divide  For still fair Ajutt further proof demands  Erenuptial rites should join their plighted hands  To distant shores commands the youth to rove  To find if absence could abate his love  Bad him in search of wandering whales to roam  To crown their board when winter call'd him home  He must complyimplicit he obeys  Her will his lawwhat more a lover sways  Yet ere he went her tent with flowers he strews  Refresh'd with sweetest of the Iceland dews  Balmy as Ajutt's breath the newborn flowers  Might boast of fragrance with Arcadian bowers  These as he strew'd to Ajutt thus he said  ' Attendand markinexorable maid  ' See in these blossoms beauty's shortliv'd power  ' Beauty as fading as the morning flower  ' This hour presents them lovely to thy view  ' Impearl'd with fragrance deck'd in orient dew  ' Another comes no more they cheer thine eye  ' And ere a third revolves they droop and die  ' Such my lov'd Ajutt is the life we boast  ' A transient dream which ere enjoy'd is lost  ' Why wilt thou then enforce thy harsh command  ' And drive me wretched to the distant strand  ' Why wilt thou not my plighted vow receive  ' And be my partner on the boisterous wave  ' Then could I fearless every danger try  ' What danger can I dread when Ajutt's by  ' O virgin beauteous as the sunny beam  ' Which glittering dances on the limpid stream  ' Once more reflectrecall the sad decree  ' Be just to Ajutt and be kind to me  ' Think ere I go what frosts what fogs may rise  ' And join'd preclude thy presence from my eyes  ' Thou know'st my fair our clime condemn'd to frost  ' Of days and nights alternate cannot boast  ' Like those gay climes by lying strangers told  ' Where houses screen them from inclement cold  ' Ere my return dread winter's bird may sing  ' And night o'ertake me with an eagle's wing  ' What then in those lone months can cheer my soul  ' Not seal delicious nor the flowing bowl  ' The flaming lamps without thy eyes would fade  ' Nor healing oil could cure the wound they made'  In vain the youth his utmost art essay'd  Persuasion mov'd not nor soft pity sway'd  Perversly fix'd he found the cruel maid  But ere he went his last respect to show  Seven ermine skins that rival'd Greenland's snow  With five fair swans he as a tribute gave  And seals fresh bleeding from the briny wave  With marble lamps and oil of curious taste  To deck her board and crown the rich repast  With joy refin'd this gift the nymph receiv'd  As proof of love from him in whom she liv'd  Then trembling wish'd the parting pang was o'er  While pitying sighs her lovelorn basom tore  The ready boat the tardy youth upbraids  And frequent summons from the rowing maids  ' I come he criesmy Ajutt lov'd adieu  ' Forget me not my fairbe justbe true'  The words by grief half frozen on his tongue  He sigh'dshe weptand on his bosom hung  Then vow'd unchanging love and fervent pray'd  The powers to guard him for his faithful maid  And that no mermaid syren of the deep  Might snatch her love or give her cause to weep  With sorrow tender as the constant dove  Who mourns the tedious absence of her love  Did Anningait his lovely Ajutt leave  And from her wish his only joy receive  With her's his own he joins and prays each power  To guard his maid and hasle their nuptial hour  Then onward movesnow looks a last adieu  While tender eloquence his cheeks bedew  Thrice he attempts his floating bark to leave  And swim to Ajutt o'er the dashing wave  Like some fair image Ajutt lifeless stands  Surveys his boat and marks the printed sands  Till waves and rocks her prospect intercept  Her hut then sought and there in private wept  But rous'd by hope of Anningait's return  Each female art she tries in various turn  One hour the greenest moss she culls with care  And dries the grass for Anningait to wear  Of softest skins a fishing coat she wrought  Of curious form like him of whom she thought  A boat of toughest skins together sew'd  And as she work'd each tender vow renew'd  Then in soft numbers each good genius prays  To guide her swain thro' Terror's pathless ways  And that his nervous arms might stronger prove  Than the fierce bear nor aught annoy her love  That his swift darts unerring he might guide  That his tough boat might bravely stem the tide  That the crack'd ice might ne'er his feet betray  Nor his harpoon might ever fail the prey  Thus in lone sadness Ajutt still remains  Nor joins the maidens on the jocund plains  Her locks unbraided o'er her shoulders flow  In beauteous negligence and pomp of woe  Their rural sports she now no more adorns  Nor thinks of joy till Anningait returns  While he by calms detain'd or tempest tost  Vainly attemps to reach the destin'd coast  Banish'd from Ajutt all his joys are lost  Sighing he stands and views the ruffled main  And thus to life compares the varied scene  ' O frail uncertain state where shall we find  ' A truer emblem of the human mind  ' Than in the floating ice by billows tost  ' It towers on high there sparkles and is lost  ' The sunbeams bright dissolve the glittering toy  ' And rocks below their hidden power employ  ' Each cause concurs this certain truth to prove  ' No joys are permanent but those above  ' What art thou Pleasure fleeting as a dream  ' Which sudden blazes like a northern gleam  ' That plays a moment on our dazled eyes  ' Then palls and fades and in an instant dies  ' What art thou Love the whirlpool of our rest  ' The fatal eddy of the human breast  ' The soft sensation that unseen obtains  ' Such sovereign sway soon absolute it reigns  ' Had not my eyes thy charms O Ajutt trac'd  ' The sweet expressions that thy person grac'd  ' The winning softness and th' attracting mien  ' Which conscious spoke the Graces dwelt within  ' Then had I still with downy ease been blest  ' Slept like the careless morse in vacant rest  ' Joyous as minstrels in the starry sphere  ' Had felt no grief a stranger still to care  ' But if my lovely fair will true remain  ' How light each toil and overpaid each pain  ' That sweet reflection shall my peace restore  ' She's just as fair and we shall part no more  ' That thought my Ajutt shall my nerves newbrace  ' I'll hunt the raindeer to the utmost chace  ' A few weeks past then loaded I'll return  ' And Love's pure flame for us shall grateful burn  ' Roefish and porpoise shall thy kindred feast  ' And thou shalt smile on every friendly guest  ' The fox and hare shall Ajutt's couch enfold  ' And seals tough skins shall screen thee from the cold  ' The marble lamps with sweetest oil I'll fill  ' To light thy tent and fragrant fumes distill  ' Haste then O time add swiftness to thy flight  ' For without Ajutt horrid were the night'  Thus was the youth alternate captive led  By smiling Hope Dismay and anxious Dread  Till rous'd by spouting whales his ardour glows  He with new courage to the combat goes  Ajutt a sweet recluse from all she lov'd  Retirement wooed by social joys unmov'd  True to her love as is th' attracted steel  In thought feels every woe that he might feel  Once as she stray'd by gentle labour led  Drying soft skins to deck her lover's bed  Nornsuck a mighty chief among their swains  Return'd from hunting on the distant plains  The maid he raptur'd views with so  t surprize  And falls a victim to her conquering eyes  Fair without gaudy pomp or studied art  Her native beauty struck the hero's heart  By Love o'erawed whose power he now first knew  Speechless he gaz'd and wist not what to do  But ready Hope her healing succour sends  And bids him gain the fairone by her friends  For much he fear'd his suit to Ajutt vain  Yet bless'd the absence of her favour'd swain  Revolves with joy his birth and mighty store  For great his wealth no Greenland swain had more  With these resolves her parents faith to try  And hopes their power might win her to comply  Yet first presumes his passion to disclose  And o'er her neck a dappled deerskin throws  This with disdain the faithful maid returns  And then for Anningait afresh she mourns  Her father's distant hutt he instant sought  His worth explain'd and every tender thought  Which soon their sordid minds to his opinion wrought  Home when the maid returns with artful tale  They praise young Nornsuck hero of the vale  His power his wealth they set in dazzling light  His vast possessions for th' approaching night  How bright his form for true the youth was fair  In graceful ringlets flow'd his jetty hair  His person pleasing and quick piercing eye  That might for brightness with the eagle's vie  His ardent passion crown'd the irksome tale  But vain each art that dar'd her truth assail  With silent scorn th' amazing change she hears  That they forget her vow and daily tears  At last long urg'd she painful silence broke  And thus her sentiments in anguish spoke  ' Sooner shall whales their liquid world forsake  ' And seek for pastime in the half froze lake  ' Sooner shall endless night o'er Greenland reign  ' And cheering sunshine never gild the plain  ' Than I in thought or word my love forego  ' Fix'd as my native frost unblemish'd as my snow'  Then swift as bounding hart away she fled  And travers'd hill or dale as fancy led  Firmly resolv'd the hutt to see no more  Till Anningait arriv'd on Greenland's shore  A willing exile from her father's board  Her wants supplied from Nature's varied hoard  She oft high cliffs ascends and eager eyes  The distant main in curling billows rise  Each time new hope her anxious bosom cheers  Nay more than hope for now the boat appears  The wish'd for bark in loaded pomp returns  Wild with the joy no longer now she mourns  But darts with rapid ease o'er hill and dale  Now scours the plain or skims along the vale  Till faint with joy she gains the pebbled shore  And hails the bark and hears the dashing oar  Then with loud rapture calls her destin'd mate  Her life her lord her muchlov'd Anningait  But the glad sounds no Anningait repays  Trembling she wonders at th' unkind delays  Eager the cruel reason she demands  When drop the oars from each one's nerveless hands  Aghast they gaze as Anningait she calls  Nor know what fate the hapless swain befalls  The youth impatient long before was gone  In a swift boat unloaded and alone  Their tedious voyage Love could not approve  That so long kept him from expecting Love  But how or where he was they knew no more  Than she just lifeless on the crouded shore  With horror struck immoveable she stands  And wets with copious tears the thirsty sands  The virgin train in social woe attend  And all bewail the anguish of their friend  Her kindred round now mourn then sooth her woes  And from each friendly tongue persuasionflows  They try to win her home and calm her mind  But she was deaf as rocks and heedless as the wind  With gentle force at last they brought her there  And seek each lenitive to sooth her care  Then her soft couch with sleekest skins they spread  And lead her gently to her longleft bed  Then pray'd the downy god to seal her eyes  And that sweet Peace again might with her rise  She thankful heard but knew their wish was vain  From Anningait thus torn all life was pain  Yet lulls her grief with sad reflection's power  That forth unheeded in the silent hour  When the soft deity their pillows strew'd  And in sweet slumber every sense subdued  She might with safety gain the lateleft shore  And for her love each terror would explore  With double pain th' unwilling moments fly  Till all was hush'd and clos'd was every eye  Then instant quits her once lov'd place of rest  Where Peace long dwelt tho' now no more a guest  Softly she stole her sleeping friends to view  And look'd and sigh'd a tender last adieu  Now filial tenderness her bosom tore  That those dear objects she might see no more  But what O Nature are thy feebler ties  When Love inspires thy sweet sensation flies  Her fearwing'd feet the distant shore soon gain  Seize the first boat then boldly plough the main  Nor more her native Greenland ever trod  Nor yet the youthSome think an angry god  The potent genius of the floods

glittering mirror I complain  " Why envied stream when you so clearly shine  " Smiles not my bosom as serene as thine  " O whisper gliding to my anxious breast  " Why sighs it thus and wishes to be blest"  Still pensive I complain'd th' unanswering stream  Still tinkled on and lull'd me to a dream  There I beheld a beauteous nymph arise  Smiling her looks and languishing her eyes  Startled I

rays incessant streaming  Dewdrops sparkling twinkling beaming  Refreshed Nature smiles anew  And brings her brightest charms to view  On Delia thinking will I stray  Heedless where I chuse the way  Over distant hills and dales  Bleating mountains lowing vales  By silent river rolling flood  Fringed meadow waving wood  Where Flora does her sweets dispense  And different prospects please the sense  While sturdy oxen grazing nigh  With loud lowings fill the sky  And the swallow skims the ground  And the lambkin bleateth round  And many a cuckow's echoing note  Wavering to the ear doth float  Such pleasing sounds and sights inspire  Glowing love and soft desire  Sweet hour of pleasure then to chuse  Breathe the soft strain and court the muse  Fairest Delia be my theme  By some whispering silver stream  That thro' the painted meads doth stray  And swiftly trickling winds away  And when the sun exalted high  Fierceglowing measures half the sky  Oft oh my Delia will we rove  Along some closeembowred grove  Oh the soft joys that fill the breast  Joys the sweetest and the best  When by allpowerful Love excited  Each delighting each delighted  We sit within some thickwove bower  Full fragrant made by many a flower  With thrilling pleasure I the while  Eye the kind glance or dimpling smile  Or oft in sweet suspension hung  Catch the music of her tongue  Else in sweet notes briskly moving  Airy fluttering wild and roving  Thrice and four times and again  Both chant to love the pleasing strain  Or if the garden's flowery pride  Call our vagrant steps aside  Here unnumber'd charms invite  Roses red and lillies white  Here 'mid blooming fragrance straying  Sweetly smiling fondly playing  Oft my willing hands prepare  Odorous garlands for my fair  And mix around the charmer's head  The lilly's white the rose's red  While Love inspires each warbler's throat  Smooths the strain or swells the note  All around and all above  All is Joy for all is Love  But when the cooling evening breeze  Moves gently the reluctant trees  Then will we ofttimes stray unseen  By winding walks of willows green  And there the charms of music prove  For music is the food of Love  Inspiring oft the warbling flute  Now with complaining strains that suit  The vexed thoughts and barbed care  Of fixed sullen deep despair  Now more luxuriant strains employ  Quickening Love and brightening Joy  Such as might the soul beguile  And make disturbed sorrow smile  Now the music varying floats  Then stops anon more still the notes  Smooth and languid soft and low  Tender trilling sweet and slow

slumbering morn  Waking nature haply may  Lure us to the chace away  Farewell then thou willow'd stream  Glittering bright with wisdom's beam  Silver Cam whose bowers among  Inspiration leads her throng  Clio breathes celestial fire  Music hangs her dulcet lyre  Yet farewellTo brighter joys  Pleasure lifts our wandering eyes  With her own resistless smile  She shall smooth each care awhile  Yes she fair queen shall all the mind possess  With gladness fire it and with rapture bless  C T HARTIS  POMONA A PASTORAL  BY J CUNNINGHAM  FRom orchards of ample extent  Pomona's compell'd to depart  And thus as in anguish she went  The goddess unburthen'd her heart  To flourish where liberty reigns  Was all my fond wishes requir'd  And here I agreed with the swains  To live till their freedom expir'd  Of late ye have number'd my trees  And threaten'd to limit my store  I fearfrom such maxims as these  I fearthat your freedom's no more  My flight will be fatal to May  For how can her gardens be fine  The blossoms are doom'd to decay  The blossoms I mean that were mine  Rich autumn remembers me well  My fruitage was fair to behold  My pears how I ripen'd their swell  My pippinswere pippins of gold  Let Ceres drudge on with her ploughs  She droops as she furrows the soil  A nectar I shake from my boughs  A nectar that softens my toil  When Bacchus began to repine  With patience I bore his abuse  He said that I plunder'd the vine  He said that I pilfer'd his juice  I know the proud drunkard denies  That trees of my culture should grow  But let not the traitor advise  He comes from the climes of your foe  Alas in your silence I read  The sentence I'm doom'd to deplore  'Tis plain the great Pan has decreed  My orchards shall flourish no more  The goddess flew off in despair  As all her sweet honours declin'd  And Plenty and Pleasure declare  They'll loiter no longer behind  THE MAN OF KENT  IN IMITATION OF POPE'S MAN OF ROSS  WHY are our thoughts on lords alone intent  Rise honest muse and sing The Man of Kent  Pleas'd Medway echoes thro' her winding bounds  While distant Tweed her hoarse applause resounds  Who form'd the band that late near Minden's towers  Stood first in triumph o'er proud Gallia's powers  The Man of Kent methinks each soldier says  And grateful lavishes on him the praise  No useless rule did e'er his plan degrade  No idle motion taught for mean parade  He practis'd still each lesson that he gave  Wise was each lesson pertinent and brave  When Rochfort menac'd by impending fate  To British arms half op'd her trembling gate  Who boldly then explor'd the hostile strand  And at the council nobly urg'd to land  The same firm purpose who at home avow'd  The Man of Kent let all proclaim aloud  Behold where Louisbourg declines her head  The Man of Kent the way to conquest led  First on the beach he leapt with ardent haste  And up the rocky steep resistless pass'd  Th' affrighted foe with grief and wonder saw  And bow'd submissive to Britannia's law  Is there aught else the hero's toil to crown  To tempt ambition or ensure renown  There is there is th' enraptur'd nation cries  And to Quebec directs her zealous eyes  This last best gift the Man of Kent bestow'd  And seal'd alas our title with his blood  Illustrious chief thee British youths shall mourn  And pay due homage to thy martial urn  Each matron's breast in sympathy shall heave  Yet sighing wish for such a son to grieve  Each British maid shall weep thy hapless fair  Her love shall pity envy and revere  Infants unborn shall learn to lisp thy name  And thence shall emulate thy deathless fame  Thrice happy man enabled to pursue  What all so wish'd but wanted power to do  Say o'er his head what circling years had roll'd  For this a century was scarce too old  Merit and years in pace full rare agree  All this did he atchieveat thirtythree  VERSES BY THE FAMOUS EARL OF ESSEX  Robert Devereux earl of Essex once the favourite of queen Elizabeth for some time the minion of fortune and always the darling of the people was beheaded in the Tower on Ashwednesday the th of February in the year in the th year of his age Sir Christopher Blount and Sir  Danvers suffered about the same time  HAppy were he could finish forth his fate  In some unhaunted desert moste obscure  From all societies from love and hate  Of worldly folkes then might he sleepe secure  Then wake againe and give God praise  Content with hippes and hawes and bramble berrie  In contemplation spending all his dayes  And change of holy thoughts to make him merrie  Whence when he dyes his tombe may be a bush  Where harmeles Robin dwells with gentle Thrush  THE BUZZING BEE'S COMPLAINT  BY THE SAME  IT was a tyme when sillie bees could speake  And in that tyme was I a sillie bee  Whoe suckt on tyme untill my harte did breake  Yet never found that tyme would favor mee  Of all the swarme I onely could not thrive  Yet brought I waxe and honney to the hive  When thus I buz'd when tyme no sap would give  Why then is blessed tyme to me soe drye  Sith in this tyme the lazie droane doth live  The waspe the worme the gnat and butterflie  Mated with greeffe I kneeled on my knees  And thus complain'd I to the king of bees  My leege God grant thy tyme may never end  And yet vowesafe to heare my plainte of tyme  Which every fruitles flie hath found a friend  And I cast downe wheare attomies doe clime  The king replyed but thus"peace peaving bee  " Thou'rt borne to serve the tyme the tyme not thee"  The tyme not thee this word clipt shorte my winges  And made me wormelike creepe that once did flye  Awfull reguard disputeth not with kings  Receveth a repulse not askinge why  Then for a tyme I for a tyme withdrewe  To feede on henbane hemlockes nettells rue  But from these leaves noe dram of sweete I drayne  Their headstronge furie did my witts bewitch  And thence disperst blacke blood in everie vaine  For honney gall for wax I gathered pitch  My combe a hole my hive a cave must bee  Soe chang'd that bees scarse tooke me for a bee  I woorke on meedes the moone was in the waine  Whilst all the swarme in sunshine taste the rose  On blacke roote ferne I sit and sucke my bane  Whilst on the eglantine the rest repose  Havinge too much they still repine for more  And cloy'd with fatnes surfet in the store  Swollen fatt with feasts full merriely they pass  In swarminge clusters falling on a tree  Where findinge me to nyble on the grasse  Some scorne some muse and some doe pitty mee  And some envie and whisper to the king  Some must be still and some must have noe stinge  Are bees waxt waspes or spiders to infect  Do honneysweete combes make the spirrit gall  Is this the juce of flowers to stirr suspect  Is't not enough to tread on them that fall  What stinge hath patience but a sighing greeffe  That stinges naught but itself without releefe  True patience is the provender of fooles  Sad patience that awaiteth at the doore  Patience that learnes thus to conclude in schooles  Patient I am therefore I must be poore  Great king of bees that rightest everie wronge  Listen to patience in his dyinge songe  I cannot feede on fennell like some flies  Nor fly to everie flower to gather gaine  Mine appetite waytes on my prince's eies  Contented with contempt and eas'd with paine  And yet expectinge one more happy hower  When he shall saythis bee shall sucke a flower  Of all the greeffes that moste my patience mate  There's one that fretteth in the highest degree  To see some caterbillers bred of late  Cropping the fruites that should sustaine the bee  Yet smiled I for that the wisest knowes  The mothes doe fret the cloth cancker the rose  Once did I see by flyinge in the feild  Fowle beasts to browze upon the lillies faire  Vertue and bewtie could not succor yeelde  Alls provender for asses but the aire  The partiall world of this takes litell heede  To give them flowers that should on thistles feede  'Tis onely I must draine the noxious flowers  Havinge noe savor bitter supp they have  And seeke on rotten tombes the dead mens bowers  And byte on pathos growinge by the grave  If this I cannot have as hapless bee  Witchinge tobacco I will flye to thee  What tho' thou dyest my longes in deepest blacke  A mourning habit suits a sable harte  What tho' thy fumes found memmorie doe cracke  Forgetfulnes is fittest for my smarte  O vertuous fume let it be carv'd in oake  That wordes hopes witts and all the world is smoake  Five yeares twise told with promises perfum'd  My hopestuft head was cast into a slumber  Sweete dreames of gold on gold I then presum'd  Amongest the bees I thought me of the number  Wakinge I found hivehopes had made me vaine  'Twas not tobacco stupefied my braine  ESSEX'S LAST VOYAGE TO THE HAVEN OF HAPPINESS  WElcome sweete Death the kindest friend I have  This fleshly prison of my sowle unlocke  With all the speede thou canst provide my grave  Gett an axe ready and prepare the blocke  Unto the queene I have a debt to paye  This Febrewarye's five and twentieth day  Come Patience come and take me by the hande  And trew Repentance teach myne eyes to weepe  Humyllity in neede of thee I

have my youth misled  I have inclyn'd to luste and wantonnesse  My synnes are more then haires upon my hed  Without within and round on every side  Folly uncleanes vanity and pride  Forgett forgive lett not thy wrath incense  Sweete Saviour Christ my mediatour be  O pitty Lord O pardon myne offence  From throne of grace lett mercy looke on mee  View not the evills in justice I have done  Lay all my faultes on thy synnesalvinge son  And Lorde lett my corruptions never rise  As wittnesses of horrour wrath and feare  Tho' synne hath suited me in hell's disguise  Graunt me the weddingegarment saints do weare  Sweete Jesus make thy bloud the only meane  To washe my stayned sowle unspotted cleane  Poure on my harte the sweetest streames of grace  And feed my hungry hopes with heavenly love  From my complaynts turn not away thy face  Reach me thy hande to lifte my thoughts above  That I before thy presence may appeere  Altho' this filthy lumpe of flesh stay here  Before I had a beeinge life or breath  By thy great goodness I obtain'd creation  When I was captive in the jayle of death  Thy mercy did redeeme me to salvation  Thou wounded wast to heale the woundes syn gave me  And thou didst dye only of love to save me  ODE FOR HIS MAJESTY'S BIRTHDAY JUNE IV MDCCLXIII  BY WILLIAM WHITEHEAD ESQ  COmmon births like common things  Pass unheeded or unknown  Time but spreads or waves his wings  The phantom swells the phantom's gone  Born for millions monarchs rise  Heirs of infamy or fame  When the virtuous brave or wise  Demand our praise with loud acclaim  We twine the festive wreath the shrines adorn  'Tis not our king's alone 'tis Britain's natal morn  Bright examples plac'd on high  Shine with more distinguish'd blaze  Thither nations turn their eye  And grow virtuous as they gaze  Thoughtless ease and sportive leisure  Dwell in life's contracted sphere  Public is the monarch's pleasure  Public is the monarch's care  If Titus smiles the observant world is gay  If Titus frowns or sighs we sigh and lose a day  Around their couch around their board  A thousand ears attentive wait  A thousand busy tongues record  The smallest whispers of the great  Happy those whom Truth sincere  And conscious Virtue join to guide  Can they have a foe to fear  Can they have a thought to hide  Nobly they soar above th' admiring throng  Superior to the power the will of acting wrong  Such may Britain find her kings  Such the Muse of rapid wings  Wafts to some sublimer sphere  Gods and heroes mingle there  Fame's eternal accents breath  Black Cocytus howls beneath  Ev'n Malice learns to blush and hide her stings  O such may Britain ever find her kings  A SONG  WHen a nymph at her toilet has spent the whole day  To shine in brocade at a ball or the play  Her rival the butterfly vain to excess  May be justly more proud if there's merit in dress  The purple and gold in his plumage display'd  Than velvet's more soft and more gay than brocade  But with all this advantage of dress you may see  That the butterfly still is less lov'd than the bee  For the bee tho' he shines with no purple and gold  We provide a good lodging to fence from the cold  For his honey we love him altho' he will sting  And despise the gay insects that flutter and sing  And hence the coquet this plain lesson may find  " That the useful alone are the lov'd of mankind"  Let the foolish and vain at the toilet still vie  In a fruitless endeavour to rival a fly  Which if they could do like the fly for a day  By fools they'd be play'd with and then thrown away  Let me like the bee every moment improve  And merit a love which no time shall remove  THE COMPARISON BETWEEN JOHN CHURCHILL DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH AND CHARLES CHURCHILL ANTICALEDONIAN  IN Anna's wars immortal Churchill
