 THE TRAVELLER OR A PROSPECT of SOCIETY  Price One Shilling and Six Pence  THE TRAVELLER OR A PROSPECT of SOCIETY A POEM INSCRIBED TO THE REV MR HENRY GOLDSMITH BY OLIVER GOLDSMITH M B  LONDON Printed for J NEWBERY in St Paul's Churchyard MDCCLXV  TO THE REV HENRY GOLDSMITH  Dear Sir  I AM sensible that the friendship between us can acquire no new force from the ceremonies of a Dedication and perhaps it demands an excuse thus to prefix your name to my attempts which you decline giving with your own But as a part of this Poem was formerly written to you from Switzerland the whole can now with propriety be only inscribed to you It will also throw a light upon many parts of it when the reader understands that it is addressed to a man who despising Fame and Fortune has retired early to Happiness and Obscurity with an income of forty pounds a year  I now perceive my dear brother the wisdom of your humble choice You have entered upon a sacred office where the harvest is great and the labourers are but few  while you have left the field of Ambition where the labourers are many and the harvest not worth carrying away But of all kinds of ambition as things are now circumstanced perhaps that which pursues poetical fame is the wildest What from the encreased refinement of the times from the diversity of judgments produced by opposing systems of criticism and from the more prevalent divisions of opinion influenced by party the strongest and happiest efforts can expect to please but in a very narrow circle Though the poet were as sure of his aim as the imperial archer of antiquity who boasted that he never missed the heart yet would many of his shafts now fly at random for the heart is too often in the wrong place  Poetry makes a principal amusement among unpolished nations but in a country verging to the extremes of refinement Painting and Music come in for a share And as they offer the feeble mind a less laborious entertainment they at first rival Poetry and at length supplant her they engross all favour to themselves and though but younger sisters seize upon the elder's birthright  Yet however this art may be neglected by the powerful it is still in greater danger from the mistaken efforts of the learned to improve it What criticisms have we not heard of late in favour of blank verse and Pindaric odes chorusses anapests and iambics alliterative care and happy negligence Every absurdity has now a champion to defend it and as he is generally much in the wrong so he has always much to say  But there is an enemy to this art still more dangerous I mean party Party entirely distorts the judgment and destroys the taste A mind capable of relishing general beauty when once infected with this disease can only find pleasure in what contributes to encrease the distemper Like the tyger that seldom desists from pursuing man after having once preyed upon human flesh the reader who has once gratified his appetite with calumny makes ever after the most agreeable feast upon murdered reputation Such readers generally admire some halfwitted thing who wants to be thought a bold man having lost the character of a wise one Him they dignify with the name of poet his lampoons are called  satires his turbulence is said to be force and his phrenzy fire  What reception a Poem may find which has neither abuse party nor blank verse to support it I cannot tell nor am I much solicitous to know My aims are right Without espousing the cause of any party I have attempted to moderate the rage of all I have endeavoured to shew that there may be equal happiness in other states though differently governed from our own that each state has a peculiar principle of happiness and that this principle in each state and in our own in particular may be carried to a mischievous excess There are few can judge better than youself How far these positions are illustrated in this Poem  I am Sir Your most affectionate Brother OLIVER GOLDSMITH  THE TRAVELLER OR A PROSPECT of SOCIETY  REMOTE unfriended melancholy slow  Or by the lazy Scheld or wandering Po  Or onward where the rude Carinthian boor  Against the houseless stranger shuts the door  Or where Campania's plain forsaken lies  A weary waste expanded to the skies  Where'er I roam whatever realms to see  My heart untravell'd fondly turns to thee  Still to my brother turns with ceaseless pain  And drags at each remove a lengthening chain  Eternal blessings crown my earliest friend  And round his dwelling guardian saints attend  Blest be that spot where chearful guests retire  To pause from toil and trim their evening fire  Blest that abode where want and pain repair  And every stranger finds a ready chair  Blest be those feasts where mirth and peace abound  Where all the ruddy family around  Laugh at the jests or pranks that never fail  Or sigh with pity at some mournful tale  Or press the bashful stranger to his food  And learn the luxury of doing good  But me not destin'd such delights to share  My prime of life in wand'ring spent and care  Impell'd with steps unceasing to pursue  Some fleeting good that mocks me with the view  That like the circle bounding earth and skies  Allures from far yet as I follow flies  My fortune leads to traverse realms alone  And find no spot of all the world my own  Even now where Alpine solitudes ascend  I sit me down a pensive hour to spend  And plac'd on high above the storm's career  Look downward where an hundred realms appear  Lakes forests cities plains extended wide  The pomp of kings the shepherd's humbler pride  When thus Creation's charms around combine  Amidst the store 'twere thankless to repine  'Twere affectation all and schooltaught pride  To spurn the splendid things by heaven supply'd  Let schooltaught pride dissemble all it can  These little things are great to little man  And wiser he whose sympathetic mind  Exults in all the good of all mankind  Ye glittering towns with wealth and splendour crown'd  Ye fields where summer spreads profusion round  Ye lakes whose vessels catch the busy gale  Ye bending swains that dress the flow'ry vale  For me your tributary stores combine  Creation's heir the world the world is mine  As some lone miser visiting his store  Bends at his treasure counts recounts it o'er  Hoards after hoards his rising raptures fill  Yet still he sighs for hoards are wanting still  Thus to my breast alternate passions rise  Pleas'd with each good that heaven to man supplies  Yet oft a sigh prevails and sorrows fall  To see the sum of human bliss so small  And oft I wish amidst the scene to find  Some spot to real happiness consign'd  Where my worn soul each wand'ring hope at rest  May gather bliss to see my fellows blest  Yet where to find that happiest spot below  Who can direct when all pretend to know  The shudd'ring tenant of the frigid zone  Boldly asserts that country for his own  Extols the treasures of his stormy seas  And livelong nights of revelry and ease  The naked Negro panting at the line  Boasts of his golden sands and palmy wine  Basks in the glare or stems the tepid wave  And thanks his Gods for all the good they gave  Nor less the patriot's boast where'er we roam  His first best country ever is at home  And yet perhaps if states with states we scan  Or estimate their bliss on Reason's plan  Though patriots flatter and though fools contend  We still shall find uncertainty suspend  Find that each good by Art or Nature given  To these or those but makes the balance even  Find that the bliss of all is much the same  And patrioric boasting reason's shame  Nature a mother kind alike to all  Still grants her bliss at Labour's earnest call  And though rough rocks or gloomy summits frown  These rocks by custom turn to beds of down  From Art more various are the blessings sent  Wealth splendours honor liberty content  Yet these each other's power so strong contest  That either seems destructive of the rest  Hence every state to one lov'd blessing prone  Conforms and models life to that alone  Each to the favourite happiness attends  And spurns the plan that aims at other ends  'Till carried to excess in each domain  This favourite good begets peculiar pain  But let us view these truths with closer eyes  And trace them through the prospect as it lies  Here for a while my proper cares resign'd  Here let me sit in sorrow for mankind  Like yon neglected shrub at random cast  That shades the steep and sighs at every blast  Far to the right where Appennine ascends  Bright as the summer Italy extends  Her uplands sloping deck the mountain's side  Woods over woods in gay theatric pride  While oft some temple's mould'ring top between  With venerable grandeur marks the scene  Could Nature's bounty satisfy the breast  The sons of Italy were surely blest  Whatever fruits in different climes are found  That proudly rise or humbly court the ground  Whatever blooms in torrid tracts appear  Whose bright succession decks the varied year  Whatever sweets salute the northern sky  With vernal lives that blossom but to die  These here disporting own the kindred soil  Nor ask luxuriance from the planter's toil  While seaborn gales their gelid wings expand  To winnow fragrance round the smiling land  But small the bliss that sense alone bestows  And sensual bliss is all this nation knows  In florid beauty groves and fields appear  Men seem the only growth that dwindles here  Contrasted faults through all their manners reign  Though poor luxurious though submissive vain  Though grave yet trifling zealous yet untrue  And even in penance planning sins anew  All evils here contaminate the mind  That opulence departed leaves behind  For wealth was theirs nor far remov'd the date  When commerce proudly flourish'd through the state  At her command the palace learnt to rise  Again the longfall'n column sought the skies  The canvass glow'd beyond even Nature warm  The pregnant quarry teem'd with human form  But more unsteady than the southern gale  Soon Commerce turn'd on other shores her sail  And late the nation found with fruitless skill  Their former strength was now plethoric ill  Yet though to fortune lost here still abide  Some splendid arts the wrecks of former pride  From which the feeble heart and long fall'n mind  An easy compensation seem to find  Here may be seen in bloodless pomp array'd  The pasteboard triumph and the cavalcade  Processions form'd for piety and love  A mistress or a saint in every grove  By sports like these are all their cares beguil'd  The sports of children satisfy the child  At sports like these while foreign arms advance  In passive ease they leave the world to chance  When struggling Virtue sinks by long controul  She leaves at last or feebly mans the soul  While low delights succeeding fast behind  In happier meanness occupy the mind  As in those domes where Caesars once bore sway  Defac'd by time and tottering in decay  Amidst the ruin heedless of the dead  The shelterseeking peasant builds his shed  And wond'ring man could want the larger pile  Exults and owns his cottage with a smile  My soul turn from them turn we to survey  Where rougher climes a nobler race display  Where the bleak Swiss their stormy mansions tread  And force a churlish soil for scanty bread  No product here the barren hills afford  But man and steel the soldier and his sword  No vernal blooms their torpid rocks array  But winter lingering chills the lap of May  No Zephyr fondly sooths the mountain's breast  But meteors glare and stormy glooms invest  Yet still even here content can spread a charm  Redress the clime and all its rage disarm  Though poor the peasant's hut his feasts though small  He sees his little lot the lot of all  Sees no contiguous palace rear its head  To shame the meanness of his humble shed  No costly lord the sumptuous banquet deal  To make him loath his vegetable meal  But calm and bred in ignorance and toil  Each wish contracting fits him to the soil  Chearful at morn he wakes from short repose  Breasts the keen air and carrols as he goes  With patient angle trolls the finny deep  Or drives his vent'rous plowshare to the steep  Or seeks the den where snow tracks mark the way  And drags the struggling savage into day  At night returning every labour sped  He sits him down the monarch of a shed  Smiles by his chearful fire and round surveys  His childrens looks that brighten at the blaze  While his lov'd partner boastful of her hoard  Displays the cleanly platter on the board  And haply too some pilgrim thither led  With many a tale repays the nightly bed  Thus every good his native wilds impart  Imprints the patriot passion on his heart  Dear is that shed to which his soul conforms  And dear that hill which lifts him to the storms  And as a babe when scaring sounds molest  Clings close and closer to the mother's breast  So the loud torrent and the whirlwind's roar  But bind him to his native mountains more  These are the charms to barren states assign'd  Their wants are few their wishes all confin'd  Yet let them only share the praises due  If few their wants their pleasures are but few  Since every want that stimulates the breast  Becomes a source of pleasure when redrest  Hence from such lands each pleasing science flies  That first excites desire and then supplies  Unknown to them when sensual pleasures cloy  To fill the languid pause with finer joy  Unknown those powers that raise the soul to flame  Catch every nerve and vibrate through the frame  Their level life is but a smould'ring fire  Nor quench'd by want nor fan'd by strong desire  Unfit for raptures or if raptures cheer  On some high festival of once a year  In wild excess the vulgar breast takes fire  Till buried in debauch the bliss expire  But not their joys alone thus coarsly flow  Their morals like their pleasures are but low  For as refinement stops from sire to son  Unalter'd unimprov'd their manners run  And love's and friendship's finely pointed dart  Fall blunted from each indurated heart  Some sterner virtues o'er the mountain's breast  May sit like falcons cow'ring on the nest  But all the gentler morals such as play  Through life's more cultur'd walks and charm our way  These far dispers'd on timorous pinions fly  To sport and flutter in a kinder sky  To kinder skies where gentler manners reign  We turn and France displays her bright domain  Gay sprightly land of mirth and social ease  Pleas'd with thyself whom all the world can please  How often have I led thy sportive choir  With tuneless pipe beside the murmuring Loire  Where shading elms along the margin grew  And freshen'd from the wave the Zephyr flew  And haply tho' my harsh touch faltering still  But mock'd all tune and marr'd the dancer's skill  Yet would the village praise my wond'rous power  And dance forgetful of the noontide hour  Alike all ages Dames of ancient days  Have led their children through the mirthful maze  And the gay grandsire skill'd in gestic lore  Has frisk'd beneath the burthen of threescore  So blest a life these thoughtless realms display  Thus idly busy rolls their world away  Theirs are those arts that mind to mind endear  For honour forms the social temper here  Honour that praise which real merit gains  Or even imaginary worth obtains  Here passes current paid from hand to hand  It shifts in splendid traffic round the land  From courts to camps to cottages it strays  And all are taught an avarice of praise  They please are pleas'd they give to get esteem  Till seeming blest they grow to what they seem  But while this softer art their bliss supplies  It gives their follies also room to rise  For praise too dearly lov'd or warmly sought  Enfeebles all internal strength of thought  And the weak soul within itself unblest  Leans for all pleasure on another's breast  Hence ostentation here with tawdry art  Pants for the vulgar praise which fools impart  Here vanity assumes her pert grimace  And trims her robes of frize with copper lace  Here beggar pride defrauds her daily cheer  To boast one splendid banquet once a year  The mind still turns where shifting fashion draws  Nor weighs the solid worth of self applause  To men of other minds my fancy flies  Embosom'd in the deep where Holland lies  Methinks her patient sons before me stand  Where the broad ocean leans against the land  And sedulous to stop the coming tide  Lift the tall rampire's artificial pride  That spreads its arms amidst the watry roar  Scoops out an empire and usurps the shore  Onward methinks and diligently slow  The firm connected bulwark seems to go  While ocean pent and rising o'er the pile  Sees an amphibious world beneath him smile  The slow canal the yellow blossom'd vale  The willow tufted bank the gliding sail  The crowded mart the cultivated plain  A new creation rescu'd from his reign  Thus while around the wavesubjected soil  Impels the native to repeated toil  Industrious habits in each breast obtain  And industry begets a love of gain  Hence all the good from opulence that springs  With all those ills superfluous treasure brings  Are here display'd Their muchlov'd wealth imparts  Convenience plenty elegance and arts  But view them closer craft and fraud appear  Even liberty itself is barter'd here  At gold's superior charms all freedom flies  The needy sell it and the rich man buys  A land of tyrants and a den of slaves  Here wretches seek dishonourable graves  And calmly bent to servitude conform  Dull as their lakes that sleep beneath the storm  Heavens how unlike their Belgic sires of old  Rough poor content ungovernably bold  War in each breast and freedom on each brow  How much unlike the sons of Britain now  Fir'd at the sound my genius spreads her wing  And flies where Britain broods the western spring  Where lawns extend that scorn Arcadian pride  And brighter streams than fam'd Hydaspis glide  There all around the gentlest breezes stray  There gentle music melts on every spray  Creation's mildest charms are there combin'd  Extremes are only in the master's mind  Stern o'er each bosom reason holds her state  With daring aims irregularly great  I see the lords of human kind pass by  Pride in their port defiance in their eye  Intent on high designs a thoughtful band  By forms unfashion'd fresh from Nature's hand  Fierce in a native hardiness of soul  True to imagin'd right above controul  While even the peasant boasts these rights to scan  And learns to venerate himself as man  Thine Freedom thine the blessings pictur'd here  Thine are those charms that dazzle and endear  Too blest indeed were such without alloy  But foster'd even by Freedom ills annoy  That independence Britons prize too high  Keeps man from man and breaks the social tie  See though by circling deeps together held  Minds combat minds repelling and repell'd  Ferments arise imprison'd factions roar  Represt ambition struggles round her shore  Whilst overwrought the general system feels  Its motions stopt or phrenzy fires the wheels  Nor this the worst As social bonds decay  As duty love and honour fail to sway  Fictitious bonds the bonds of wealth and law  Still gather strength and force unwilling awe  Hence all obedience bows to these alone  And talent sinks and merit weeps unknown  Till Time may come when stript of all her charms  That land of scholars and that nurse of arms  Where noble stems transmit the patriot flame  And monarchs toil and poets pant for fame  One sink of level avarice shall lie  And scholars soldiers kings unhonor'd die  Yet think not thus when Freedom's ills I state  I mean to flatter kings or court the great  Perish the wish for inly satisfy'd  Above their pomps I hold my ragged pride  But when contending chiefs blockade the throne  Contracting regal power to stretch their own  When I behold a factious band agree  To call it freedom when themselves are free  Each wanton judge new penal statutes draw  Laws grind the poor and rich men rule the law  The wealth of climes where savage nations roam  Pillag'd from slaves to purchase slaves at home  Fear pity justice indignation start  Tear off reserve and bare my swelling heart  'Till half a patriot half a coward grown  I fly from petty tyrants to the throne  Yes brother curse with me that baleful hour  When first ambition struck at regal power  And thus polluting honour in its source  Gave wealth to sway the mind with double force  Have we not seen round Britain's peopled shore  Her useful sons exchang'd for useless ore  Seen all her triumphs but destruction haste  Like flaring tapers brightening as they waste  Seen opulence her grandeur to maintain  Lead stern depopulation in her train  And over fields where scatter'd hamlets rose  In barren solitary pomp repose  Have we not seen at pleasure's lordly call  The smiling longfrequented village fall  Beheld the duteous son the fire decay'd  The modest matron and the blushing maid  Forc'd from their homes a melancholy train  To traverse climes beyond the western main  Where wild Oswego spreads her swamps around  And Niagara stuns with thund'ring sound  Even now perhaps as there some pilgrim strays  Through tangled forests and through dangerous ways  Where beasts with man divided empire claim  And the brown Indian takes a deadly aim  There while above the giddy tempest flies  And all around distressful yells arise  The pensive exile bending with his woe  To stop too fearful and too faint to go  Casts a fond look where England's glories shine  And bids his bosom sympathize with mine  Vain very vain my weary search to find  That bliss which only centers in the mind  Why have I stray'd from pleasure and repose  To seek a good each government bestows  In every government though terrors reign  Though tyrant kings or tyrant laws restrain  How small of all that human hearts endure  That part which laws or kings can cause or cure  Still to ourselves in every place consign'd  Our own felicity we make or find  With secret course which no loud storms annoy  Glides the smooth current of domestic joy  The lifted ax the agonizing wheel  Luke's iron crown and Damien's bed of steel  To men remote from power but rarely known  Leave reason faith and conscience all our own  THE END  BOOKS Printed for and Sold by J NEWBERY
